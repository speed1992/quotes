But some souls, by rare fortune, are detained longer - have time to grasp a handful of tapers, which they weave into a torch. These are the torch-bearers of humanity - its poets, seers and saints, who lead and lift the race out of darkness, toward the light. They are the law-givers and saviors, the light-bringers, way-showers and truth-tellers, and without them, humanity would lose its way in the dark.","The greatest mistake physicians make is that they attempt to cure the body without attempting to cure the mind, yet the mind and the body are one and should not be treated separately!","You get to know someone better by playing for an hour than by talking for a year.","He who is of a calm and happy nature, will hardly feel the pressure of age","The greatest wealth is to live content with little.","The worst form of injustice is pretended justice.","You should not honor men more than truth.","The true lover of knowledge naturally strives for truth, and is not content with common opinion, but soars with undimmed and unwearied passion till he grasps the essential nature of things.","A true artist is someone who gives birth to a new reality.","A good decision is based on knowledge, and not on numbers.","He who does not desire power is fit to hold it.","Wisest is he who knows what he does not know.","I shall assume that your silence gives consent.","Access to power must be confined to those who are not in love with it.","The price of apathy towards public affairs is to be ruled by evil men.","If one has made a mistake, and fails to correct it, one has made a greater mistake.","Tyranny naturally arises out of democracy.","Happiness springs from doing good and helping others.","The worst of all deceptions is self-deception.","Those who tell the stories rule society.","Perfect wisdom has four parts: Wisdom, the principle of doing things aright.

This and no other is the root from which a tyrant springs; when he first appears he is a protector.","The cure of the part should not be attempted without treatment of the whole.

When we are ill... we do not ask for the handsomest physician, or the most eloquent one.","To a good man nothing that happens is evil.","Justice in the individual is now defined analogously to justice in the state. The individual is wise and brave in virtue of his reason and  spirit  respectively: he is disciplined when  spirit  and appetite are in proper subordination to reason.

For these are guilty men, whose sin is supreme ignorance of what matters most.","Dictatorship naturally arises out of democracy, and the most aggravated form of tyranny and slavery out of the most extreme liberty.","Friends should have all things in common.","To conquer oneself is the best and noblest victory; to be vanquished by one\'s own nature is the worst and most ignoble defeat.","The philosopher is in love with truth, that is, not with the changing world of sensation, which is the object of opinion, but with the unchanging reality which is the object of knowledge.","Follow your dream as long as you live, do not lessen the time of following desire, for wasting time is an abomination of the spirit.","Knowledge is the rediscovering of our own insight.","No man should bring children into the world who is unwilling to persevere to the end in their nature and education.","The direction in which education starts a man will determine his future life.","How can you prove whether at this moment we are sleeping, and all our thoughts are a dream; or whether we are awake, and talking to one another in the waking state?","The good is the beautiful.","I will prove by my life that my critics are liars.","The penalty that good men pay for not being interested in politics is to be governed by men worse than themselves.","Take charge of your thoughts. You can do what you will with them","Don\'t quarrel with your parents even if you are on the right.","Grant that I may become beautiful in my soul within, and that all my external possessions may be in harmony with my inner self.

For the lover is blinded by the object loved; so that he passes a wrong judgment on what is just, good and beautiful, thinking that he ought always to honor what belongs to himself in preference to truth. For he who intends to be a great man ought to love neither himself nor his own things, but only what is just, whether it happens to be done by himself, or by another.","No one is a friend to his friend who does not love in return.","No one is so cowardly that Love could not inspire him to heroism.","You can\'t do good if you don\'t feel good.","The seen is the changing, the unseen is the unchanging.","Music and rhythm find their way into the secret places of the soul","For a man to conquer himself is the first and noblest of all victories... The first and greatest victory is to conquer yourself; to be conquered by yourself is of all things most shameful and vile.","The cause of all sins in every case lies in the person\'s excessive love of self.","Music then is simply the result of the effects of Love on rhythm and harmony.","More will be accomplished, and better, and with more ease, if every man does what he is best fitted to do, and nothing else.","Just as it would be madness to settle on medical treatment for the body of a person by taking an opinion poll of the neighbors, so it is irrational to prescribe for the body politic by polling the opinions of the people at large.","Harmony sinks deep into the recesses of the soul and takes its strongest hold there, bringing grace also to the body & mind as well. Music is a moral law. It gives a soul to the universe, wings to the mind, flight to the imagination, a charm to sadness, and life to everything. It is the essence of order.","The eyes of the soul of the multitudes are unable to endure the vision of the divine.","The soul of man is immortal and imperishable.","Arguments derived from probabilities are idle.","Lessons, however, that enter the soul against its will never grow roots and will never be preserved inside it.","The good man is the only excellent musician, because he gives forth a perfect harmony not with a lyre or other instrument but with the whole of his life.","Music is the movement of sound to reach the soul for the education of its virtue.","Pleasure is the bait of sin","The rulers of the state are the only persons who ought to have the privilege of lying, either at home or abroad; they may be allowed to lie for the good of the state.","It gives me great pleasure to converse with the aged. They have been over the road that all of us must travel, and know where it is rough and difficult and where it is level and easy.","Music gives a soul to the universe.","The most important part of education is proper training in the nursery.","A man is not learned until he can read, write and swim.","For neither does wealth bring honour to the owner, if he be a coward; of such a one the wealth belongs to another, and not to himself. Nor does beauty and strength of body, when dwelling in a base and cowardly man, appear comely, but the reverse of comely, making the possessor more conspicuous, and manifesting forth his cowardice.","In order to seek one\'s own direction, one must simplify the mechanics of ordinary, everyday life.","No one can escape his destiny.","Excess generally causes reaction, and produces a change in the opposite direction, whether it be in the seasons, or in individuals, or in governments.","We do not learn; and what we call learning is only a process of recollection.","Nothing in the affairs of men is worthy of great anxiety.","The blame is his who chooses: God is blameless.","Wonder is the beginning of the desire to know the beautiful and the good.","The most effective kind of education is that a child should play amongst lovely things.","A wise ignorance is an essential part of knowledge.","A democracy is a state in which the poor, gaining the upper hand, kill some and banish others, and then divide the offices among the remaining citizens equally, usually by lot.","Ideas are the source of all things","Integrity is your destiny-it is the light that guides your way.","I have hardly ever known a mathematician who was capable of reasoning.","Education in music is most sovereign because more than anything else rhythm and harmony find their way to the innermost soul and take strongest hold upon it","There should be no element of slavery in learning. Enforced exercise does no harm to the body, but enforced learning will not stay in the mind. So avoid compulsion, and let your children\'s lessons take the form of play.","Man...is a tame or civilized animal; never the less, he requires proper instruction and a fortunate nature, and then of all animals he becomes the most divine and most civilized; but if he be insufficiently or ill- educated he is the most savage of earthly creatures.","There is nothing so delightful as the hearing, or the speaking of truth. For this reason, there is no conversation so agreeable as that of the man of integrity, who hears without any intention to betray, and speaks without any intention to deceive.","He who is not a good servant will not be a good master.","To do injustice is the greatest of all evils.","All thought begins with the recognition that something is out of place.","Wealth and poverty; one is the parent of luxury and indolence, and the other of meanness and viciousness, and both of discontent.","When a beautiful soul harmonizes with a beautiful form, and the two are cast in one mould, that will be the fairest of sights to him who has the eye to contemplate the vision.","No one ever teaches well who wants to teach, or governs well who wants to govern.","One trait in the philosopher\'s character we can assume is his love of the knowledge that reveals eternal reality, the realm unaffected by change and decay. He is in love with the whole of that reality, and will not willingly be deprived even of the most insignificant fragment of it - just like the lovers and men of ambition we described earlier on.","The soul takes flight to the world that is invisible but there arriving she is sure of bliss and forever dwells in paradise.","Misanthropy ariseth from a man trusting another without having sufficient knowledge of his character, and, thinking him to be truthful, sincere, and honourable, finds a little afterwards that he is wicked, faithless, and then he meets with another of the same character. When a man experiences this often, and more particularly from those whom he considered his most dear and best friends, at last, having frequently made a slip, he hates the whole world, and thinks that there is nothing sound at all in any of them.","Music is a defining element of character.","Love is a serious mental disease.","Knowledge of the soul is the only universal truth and the only wisdom - all other knowledge is transient.","There must always remain something that is antagonistic to good.","Numbers are the highest degree of knowledge.   It is knowledge itself.","Any man may easily do harm, but not every man can do good to another.","The more the pleasures of the body fade away, the greater to me is the pleasure and charm of conversation.","Many men are loved by their enemies, and hated by their friends, and are the friends of their enemies, and the enemies of their friends.","Man\'s music is seen as a means of restoring the soul, as well as confused and discordant bodily afflictions, to the harmonic proportions that it shares with the world soul of the cosmos.","When the mind\'s eye rests on objects illuminated by truth and reality, it understands and comprehends them, and functions intelligently; but when it turns to the twilight world of change and decay, it can only form opinions, its vision is confused and its beliefs shifting, and it seems to lack intelligence.","Education is teaching our children to desire the right things.","What is honored in a country will be cultivated there.","The man who hath music in his soul will be most in love with the loveliest.","No human thing is of serious importance.","No evil can happen to a good man either in life or after death.","... Societies aren t made of sticks and stones, but of men whose individual characters, by turning the scale one way or another, determine the direction of the whole.","All loves should be simply stepping stones to the love of God. So it was with me; and blessed be his name for his great goodness and mercy.","To prefer evil to good is not in human nature; and when a man is compelled to choose one of two evils, no one will choose the greater when he might have the less.","I\'m trying to think, don\'t confuse me with facts.","Justice is nothing more than the advantage of the stronger.","Whatever deceives men seems to produce a magical enchantment.","Excellent things are rare.","Let every man remind their descendants that they also are soldiers who must not desert the ranks of their ancestors, or from cowardice fall behind.","At the touch of love, everyone is a poet.","Astronomy compels the soul to look upwards and leads us from this world to another.","Our object in the construction of the state is the greatest happiness of the whole, and not that of any one class.","The wisest have the most authority.","The Dance, of all the arts, is the one that most influences the soul. Dancing is divine in its nature and is the gift of God.","Of all the animals, the boy is the most unmanageable.","Virtue is voluntary, vice involuntary.","Fly from the company of the wicked--fly and turn not back.","As the builders say, the larger stones do not lie well without the lesser.","The whole life of the philosopher is a preparation for death.","I fast for greater physical and mental efficiency","The cure of many diseases is unknown to physicians because they are ignorant of the whole... For the part can never be well unless the whole is well.","Our love for our children springs from the soul\'s greatest yearning for immortality.","Any one who has common sense will remember that the bewilderments of the eyes are of two kinds, and arise from two causes, either from coming out of the light or from going into the light, which is true of the mind\'s eye, quite as much as of the bodily eye; and he who remembers this when he sees any one whose vision is perplexed and weak, will not be too ready to laugh; he will first ask whether that soul of man has come out of the brighter light, and is unable to see because unaccustomed to the dark, or having turned from darkness to the day is dazzled by excess of light.","Let men of all ranks whether they are successful, or unsuccessful, whether they triumph or not; let them do their duty, and rest satisfied.","Seek truth while you are young, for if you do not, it will later escape your grasp","Necessity is literally the mother of invention.","The power to learn is present in everyone\'s soul, and the instrument with which each learns is like an eye that cannot be turned around from darkness to light without turning the whole body.","Justice means minding one\'s own business and not meddling with other men\'s concerns.","The unexamined life is not worth living for a human being.","Either death is a state of nothingness and utter consciousness, or, as men say, there is a change and migration of the soul from this world to another. Now if death be of such a nature, I say that to die is to gain; for eternity is then only a single night.","All the gold which is under or upon the earth is not enough to give in exchange for virtue.","All knowledge is but remembrance.","The contemplation of beauty causes the soul to grow wings.","The beginning is the most important part...for that is the time character is being formed.","Vision, in my view, is the cause of the greatest benefit to us, inasmuch as none of the accounts now given concerning the Universe would ever have been given if men had not seen the stars or the sun or the heavens. But as it is, the vision of day and night and of months and circling years has created the art of number and has given us not only the notion of Time but also means of research into the nature of the Universe. From these we have procured Philosophy in all its range, than which no greater boon ever has come or will come, by divine bestowal, unto the race of mortals.","Wonder is the feeling of the philosopher, and philosophy begins in wonder.","Come then, and let us pass a leisure hour in storytelling, and our story shall be the education of our heroes.","We obtain better knowledge of a person during one hour\'s play and games than by conversing with him for a whole year","God is not the author of all things, but of good only.","Neither do the ignorant love wisdom or desire to become wise; for this is the grievous thing about ignorance, that those who are neither good nor beautiful think they are good enough, and do not desire that which they do not think they are lacking.","The object of knowledge is what exists and its function to know about reality.","Let him know how to choose the mean and avoid the extremes on either side, as far as possible. . . . For this is the way of happiness.","Democracy passes into despotism.","One man cannot practice many arts with success.","As the government is, such will be the man.","The most beautiful motion is that which accomplishes the greatest results with the least amount of effort.","And what, Socrates, is the food of the soul? Surely, I said, knowledge is the food of the soul.","When you admonish a wrongdoer, do so gently, that it may not lead to hostility.","Man was not made for himself alone","Adultery is the injury of nature.","No one punishes the evil-doer under the notion, or for the reason, that he has done wrong -- only the unreasonable fury of a beast acts in that way. But he who desires to inflict rational punishment does not retaliate for a past wrong, for that which is done cannot be undone, but he has regard to the future, and is desirous that the man who is punished, and he who sees him punished, may be deterred from doing wrong again.","All men, well interrogated, answer well.","Madness is a divine release of the soul from the yoke of custom and convention.","Thinking: the talking of the soul with itself.","He whom Love touches not walks in darkness.","Courage is knowing what to fear.","Because it is correct to make a priority of young people, taking care that they turn out as well as possible.","The highest reach of injustice is to be deemed just when you are not.","There is truth in wine and children","My plainness of speech makes people hate me, and what is their hatred but a proof that I am speaking the truth.","Each citizen should play his part in the community according to his individual gifts.","...for the object of education is to teach us to love beauty.","To love rightly is to love what is orderly and beautiful in an educated and disciplined way.","When I hear a man discoursing of virtue, or of any sort of wisdom, who is a true man and worthy of his theme, I am delighted beyond measure: and I compare the man and his words, and note the harmony and correspondence of them. And such an one I deem to be the true musician, having in himself a fairer harmony than that of the lyre.","I would fain grow old learning many things.","Education and admonition commence in the first years of childhood, and last to the very end of life.","The three wishes of every man: to be healthy, to be rich by honest means, and to be beautiful.","And so, when a person meets the half that is his very own, whatever his orientation, whether it\'s to young men or not, then something wonderful happens: the two are struck from their senses by love, by a sense of belonging to one another, and by desire, and they don\'t want to be separated from one another, not even for a moment.","The proud man is forsaken of God.","Let brother help brother.","Necessity, who is the mother of our invention.","Is there anything worse for a state than to be split and disunited? or anything better than cohesion and unity?","Your dog is your only philosopher.","A fit of laughter, which has been indulged to excess, almost always produces a violent reaction.","When there is crime in society, there is no justice.","Excess of liberty, whether it lies in state or individuals, seems only to pass into excess of slavery.","The philosopher whose dealings are with divine order himself acquires the characteristics of order and divinity.","The wolf cares not, how many the sheep be.","Because, unlike courage and wisdom, which made our state brave and wise by being present in a particular part of it, discipline operates by being diffused throughout the whole of it. It produces a concord between its strongest and weakest and middle elements, whether you define them by the standard of good sense, or of strength, or of numbers or money or the like. And so we are quite justified in regarding discipline as this sort of natural harmony and agreement between higher and lower about which of them is to rule in state and individual.","Not only is the old man twice a child, but also the man who is drunk.","States will never be happy until \\n rulers become philosophers or \\n philosophers become rulers.","To do injustice is more disgraceful than to suffer it.","I do not live to play, but I play in order that I may live, and return with greater zest to the labors of life.","Mankind censure injustice fearing that they may be the victims of it, and not because they shrink from committing it.","The beginning is the most important part of any work, especially in the case of a young and tender thing; for that is the time at which the character is being formed and the desired impression is more readily taken.","You can remember, a single deluge only, but there were many previous ones.",". . . you did not seem to me over-fond of money. And this is the way in general with those who have not made it themselves, while those who have are twice as fond of it as anyone else. For just as poets are fond of their own poems, and fathers of their own children, so money-makers become devoted to money, not only because, like other people, they find it useful, but because it\'s their own creation.","No one knows whether death is really the greatest blessing a man can have, but they fear it is the greatest curse, as if they knew well.","Knowledge becomes evil if the aim be not virtuous.","Truth is the beginning of every good thing, both in heaven and\\non earth; and he who would be blessed and happy should be from\\nthe first a partaker of truth, for then he can be trusted.","To fear death, my friends, is only to think ourselves wise without really being wise, for it is to think that we know what we do not know.","Do you, like a skilful weigher, put into the balance the pleasures and the pains, near and distant, and weigh them, and then say which outweighs the other? If you weigh pleasures against pleasures, you of course take the more and greater; or if you weigh pains against pains, then you choose that course of action in which the painful is exceeded by the pleasant, whether the distant by the near or the near by the distant; and you avoid that course of action in which the pleasant is exceeded by the painful.","Wisdom is a blaze, kindled by a leaping spark.","I exhort you also to take part in the great combat, which is the combat of life, and greater than every other earthly conflict.","Kindness which is bestowed on the good is never lost.","Nothing can be more absurd than the practice that prevails in our country of men and women not following the same pursuits with all their strengths and with one mind, for thus, the state instead of being whole is reduced to half.","He who steals a little steals with the same wish as he who steals much, but with less power.","... the community suffers nothing very terrible if its cobblers are bad and become degenerate and pretentious; but if the Guardians of its laws and constitution, who alone have the opportunity to bring it good government and prosperity, become a mere sham, then clearly it is completely ruined.","An hour of play is worth a lifetime of conversation.","Love consists in feeling the Sacred One beating inside the loved one.","Art has no end but its own perfection.","When anything is in the presence of evil, but is not as yet evil, the presence of good arouses the desire of good in that thing; but the presence of evil, which makes a thing evil, takes away the desire and friendship of the good; for that which was once both good and evil has now become evil only, and the good has no friendship with evil.","Let nobody speak mischief of anybody.","The only real ill-doing is the deprivation of knowledge.","... the good are not willing to rule either for the sake of money or of honor.","Knowledge is true opinion.","No intelligent man will ever be so bold as to put into language those things which his reason has contemplated.","The soul of him who has education is whole and perfect and escapes the worst disease, but, if a man\'s education be neglected, he walks lamely through life and returns good for nothing to the world below.","The soul should concentrate itself by itself.","Love is the pursuit of the whole.","If particulars are to have meaning, there must be universals.","To be conquered by yourself is of all things most shameful and vile.","No attempt of curing the body should be made without curing the soul","Those who have a natural talent for calculation are generally quick-witted at every other kind of knowledge; and even the dull, if they have had an arithmetical training, although they may derive no other advantage from it, always become much quicker than they would have been.","The judge should not be young, he should have learned to know evil, not from his own soul, but from late and long observation of the nature of evil in others.","Through obedience learn to command.","Perhaps there is a pattern set up in the heavens for one who desires to see it, and having seen it, to find one in himself.","Again, truth should be highly valued; if, as we were saying, a lie is useless to the gods, and useful only as a medicine to men, then the use of such medicines should be restricted to physicians; private individuals have no business with them.","Let praise be given equally to women as well as men who have been distinguished in virtue.","There\'s a victory and defeat-the first and best of victories, the lowest and worst of defeats-which each man gains or sustains at the hands not of another, but of himself.","We are like people looking for something they have in their hands all the time; we\'re looking in all directions except at the thing we want, which is probably why we haven\'t found it.","Love is a madness produced by an unsatisfiable rational desire to understand the ultimate truth about the world.","Even the gods love jokes.","The life which is not examined is not worth living.","Homosexuality is regarded as shameful by barbarians and by those who live under despotic governments just as philosophy is regarded as shameful by them, because it is apparently not in the interest of such rulers to have great ideas engendered in their subjects, or powerful friendships or passionate love - all of which homosexuality is particularly apt to produce.","For all good and evil, whether in the body or in human nature, originates ... in the soul, and overflows from thence, as from the head into the eyes.","Apply yourself both now and in the next life. Without effort, you cannot be prosperous. Though the land be good, you cannot have an abundant crop without cultivation.","For a man to conquer himself is the first and noblest of all victories.","Do not expect justice where might is right.","Nothing is more unworthy of a wise man, or ought to trouble him more, than to have allowed more time for trifling, and useless things, than they deserve.","He who can properly define and divide is to be considered a god.","Train children not by compulsion but as if they were playing.","No attempt should be made to cure the body without the soul","It is not noble to return evil for evil, at no time ought we to do an injury to our neighbors.","They (the poets) are to us in a manner the fathers and authors of the wisdom.","The god of love lives in a state of need. It is a need. It is an urge. It is a homeostatic imbalance. Like hunger and thirst, it\'s almost impossible to stamp out.","The human race will have no respite from evils until those who are really philosophers acquire political power or until, through some divine dispensation, those who rule and have political authority in the cities become real philosophers.","Most people affirm pleasure to be the good, but the finer sort of wits say it is knowledge.","Men of sound sense have Law for their god, but men without sense Pleasure.","The ultimate design of the Mysteries ... was to lead us back to the principles from which we descended, ... a perfect enjoyment of intellectual [spiritual] good.","Love is the joy of the good, the wonder of the wise, the amazement of the Gods.","To suffer the penalty of too much haste, which is too little speed.","It is vain for the sober man to knock at poesy\'s door.","Those who refuse to engage in politics will be led by their inferiors","God is truth and light his shadow.","In things which we know, everyone will trust us ... and we may do as we please, and no one will like to interfere with us; and we are free, and masters of others; and these things will be really ours, for we shall turn them to our good.","Until philosophers rule as kings or those who are now called kings and leading men genuinely and adequately philosophise, that is, until political power and philosophy entirely coincide, while the many natures who at present pursue either one exclusively are forcibly prevented from doing so, cities will have no rest from evils,... nor, I think, will the human race.","This world is indeed a living being endowed with a soul and intelligence ... a single visible living entity containing all other living entities, which by their nature are all related.","It is through geometry that one purifies the eye of the soul.","Only the dead will know the end of the war.","The State which we have founded must possess the four cardinal virtues of wisdom, courage, discipline and justice ... Justice is the principle which has in fact been followed throughout, the principle of one man one job, of  minding one s own business , in the sense of doing the job for which one is naturally fitted and not interfering with other people.","What a handsome face he had: but if he were naked you would forget he had a face, he is so beautiful in every way.","Laws are partly formed for the sake of good men, in order to instruct them how they may live on friendly terms with one another, and partly for the sake of those who refuse to be instructed, whose spirit cannot be subdued, or softened, or hindered from plunging into evil.","That which is apprehended by intelligence and reason is always in the same state; but that which is conceived by opinion with the help of sensation and without reason, is always in a process of becoming and perishing and never really is.","The most important stage of any enterprise is the beginning.",".. we shall not be properly educated ourselves, nor will the guardians whom we are training, until we can recognise the qualities of discipline, courage, generosity, greatness of mind, and others akin to them, as well as their opposites in all their manifestations.","To be curious about that which is not one\'s concern while still in ignorance of oneself is ridiculous.","Man\'s greatest victory is over oneself.","And is there anything more closely connected with wisdom than truth?","I shall never alter my ways, not even if I have to die many times.","The real tragedy of life is when men are afraid of the light.","The cure of the part should not be attempted without the cure of the whole.","The good, of course, is always beautiful, and the beautiful never lacks proportion.","You ought not to heal the body without the soul, for this is the great error of our day in treating the human body.","The gods created certain kinds of beings to replenish our bodies... they are the trees and the plants and the seeds.","If a man be endowed with a generous mind, this is the best kind of nobility.","The punishment which the wise suffer who refuse to take part in the government, is to live under the government of worse men.","Life must be lived as play, playing certain games, making sacrifices, singing and dancing, and then a man will be able to propitiate the gods.","To do wrong is the greatest of evils.","Music is a more potent instrument than any other for education.","All who do evil and dishonorable things do them against their will.","Abstinence is the surety of temperance.","The principles are important. First, the interest of the state or society counts for everything, that of the individual for nothing. Second, the only difference between men and women is one of physical function- one begets, the other bears children. Apart from that, they both can and should perform the same functions  - though men on a whole, perform them better  and should receive the same education to enable them to do so; for in this way society will get the best value from both.","That a guardian should require another guardian to take care of him is ridiculous indeed.","Hardly any human being is capable of pursuing two professions or two arts rightly.","Geometry draws the soul towards truth.","Mathematics is the language in which the gods talk to people.","When you swear, swear seriously and solemnly, but at the same time with a smile, for a smile is the twin sister of seriousness.","And we must beg Homer and the other poets not to be angry if we strike out these and similar passages, not because they are unpoetical, or unattractive to the popular ear, but because the greater the poetical charm in them, the less are they meet for the ears of boys and men who are meant to be free, and who should fear slavery more than death.","Let parents bequeath to their children not riches, but the spirit of reverence.","So the nature required to make a really noble Guardian of our commonwealth will be swift and strong, spirited, and philosophic.","For every man who has learned to fight in arms will desire to learn the proper arrangement of an army, which is the sequel of the lesson.","Those who reproach injustice do so because they are afraid not of doing it but of suffering it.","Self conquest is the greatest of victories.","I am about to die, and that is the hour in which men are gifted with prophetic power.","If we are ever to have pure knowledge of anything, we must get rid of the body and contemplate things by themselves with the soul by itself.","Beauty is a natural superiority.","The god, O men, seems to me to be really wise; and by his oracle to mean this, that the wisdom of this world is foolishness and of none effect.","States are as the men, they grow out of human characters.","It would be better for me ... that multitudes of men should disagree with me rather than that I, being one, should be out of harmony with myself.","Worthy of honor is he who does no injustice, and more than twofold honor, if he not only does no injustice himself, but hinders others from doing any.","The community which has neither poverty nor riches will always have the noblest principles.","These, then, will be some of the features of democracy... it will be, in all likelihood, an agreeable, lawless, parti-colored commonwealth, dealing with all alike on a footing of equality, whether they be really equal or not.","Pepper is small in quantity and great in virtue.","Is what is moral commanded by God because it is moral, or is it moral because it is commanded by God?","All I really know is the extent of my own ignorance","Those whose hearts are fixed on Reality itself deserve the title of Philosophers.","The democratic youth lives along day by day, gratifying the desire that occurs to him, at one time drinking and listening to the flute, at another downing water and reducing, now practicing gymnastic, and again idling and neglecting everything; and sometimes spending his time as though he were occupied in philosophy.","When men speak ill of thee, live so that nobody will believe them.","Love is the joy of the good, the wonder of the wise, the amazement of the gods; desired by those who have no part in him, and precious to those who have the better part in him.","Love is an intermediate state between possession and deprivation.","I to die, and you to live. Which is better God only knows.","And among the other honours and rewards our young men can win for distinguished service in war and in other activities, will be more frequent opportunities to sleep with a woman; this will give us a pretext for ensuring that most of our children are born of that parent.","Do not use compulsion, but let early education be rather a sort of amusement.","Love is born into every human being; it calls back the halves of our original nature together; it tries to make one out of two and heal the wound of human nature.","For neither birth, nor wealth, nor honors, can awaken in the minds of men the principles which should guide those who from their youth aspire to an honorable and excellent life, as Love awakens them","Let us describe the education of our men. What then is the education to be? Perhaps we could hardly find a better than that which the experience of the past has already discovered, which consists, I believe, in gymnastic, for the body, and music for the mind.","Injustice is censured because the censures are afraid of suffering, and not from any fear which they have of doing injustice.","May I do to others as I would that they should do unto me.","No law or ordinance is mightier than understanding.","Who are the true philosophers? Those whose passion is to love the truth.","If there is a good and wise God, then there also exists a progress of humanity toward perfection.","Then not only an old man, but also a drunkard, becomes a second time a child.","Love is of something, and that which love desires is not that which love is or has; for no man desires that which he is or has. And love is of the beautiful, and therefore has not the beautiful. And the beautiful is the good, and therefore, in wanting and desiring the beautiful, love also wants and desires the good.","If you are wise, all men will be your friends and kindred, for you will be useful.","For this feeling of wonder shows that you are a philosopher, since wonder is the only beginning of philosophy.","Of all the things of a man\'s soul which he has within him, justice is the greatest good and injustice the greatest evil.","Virtue is a kind of health, beauty and good habit of the soul.","But he who has been earnest in the love of knowledge and of true wisdom, and has exercised his intellect more than any other part of him, must have thoughts immortal and divine. If he attain truth, and in so far as human nature is capable of sharing in immortality, he must altogether be immortal.","You ought not attempt to cure the eyes without the head, or the head without the body, so neither ought you attempt to cure the body without the soul.","Herein is the evil of ignorance, that he who is neither good nor wise is nevertheless satisfied with himself: he had no desire for that of which he feels no want.","Give me a different set of mothers and I will give you a different world","Arrogance is ever accompanied by folly.","Man is a prisoner who has no right to open the door of his prison and run away. . . . A man should wait, and not take his own life until God summons hiom.","Poets utter great and wise things which they do not themselves understand.","Whereas the truth is that the State in which the rulers are most reluctant to govern is always the best and most quietly governed, and the State in which they are most eager, the worst.","Renouncing the honors at which the world aims, I desire only to know the truth... and to the maximum of power, I exhort all other men to do the same.","The music masters familiarize children\'s minds with rhythms and melodies, thus making them more civilized, more balanced, better adjusted in themselves, and more capable in whatever they say or do, for rhythm and harmony are essential to the whole of life.","We should not exercise the body without the joint assistance of the mind; nor exercise the mind without the joint assistance of the body.","There is in every one of us, even those who seem to be most moderate, a type of desire that is terrible, wild, and lawless.","...in every man there is an eye of the soul, which...is more precious far than ten thousand bodily eyes, for by it alone is truth seen.","The true lover of learning then must his earliest youth, as far as in him lies, desire all truth.... He whose desires are drawn toward knowledge in every form will be absorbed in the pleasures of the soul, and will hardly feel bodily pleasures I mean, if he be a true philosopher and not a sham one ... Then how can he who has the magnificence of mind and is the spectator of all times and all existence, think much of human life He cannot. Or can such a one account death fearful No indeed.","A State would be happy where philosophers were kings, or kings philosophers.","In one sense it is evident that the art of kingship does include the art of lawmaking. But the political ideal is not full authority for laws but rather full authority for a man who understands the art of kingship and has kingly ability.","There still remain three studies suitable for free man. Arithmetic is one of them.","When the tyrant has disposed of foreign enemies by conquest...and there is nothing to fear from them, then he is always stirring up some war","Love is a severe mental disorder.","But at three, four, five, and even six years the childish nature will require sports; now is the time to get rid of self-will in him, punishing him, but not so as to disgrace him.","If a man can be properly said to love something, it must be clear that he feels affection for it as a whole, and does not love part of it to the exclusion of the rest.","The race of the guardians must be kept pure.","Many are the thyrsus-bearers, but few are the mystics.","Love\' is the name for our pursuit of wholeness, for our desire to be complete.","To go to the world below, having a soul which is like a vessel full of injustice, is the last and worst of all the evils.","Discordance is evil. Harmony is virtue.","The prisoner grows to love his chains.","Their military training will ensure success in war, but they must maintain unity by not allowing the state to grow to large, and by ensuring that the measures for promotion and demotion from one class to another are carried out. Above all they must maintain the educational system unchanged; for on education everything else depends, and it is an illusion to imagine that mere legislation without it can effect anything of consequence.","As the proverb says, \\"a good beginning is half the business\\" and \\"to have begun well\\" is praised by all.","And the true order of going, or being led by another, to the things of love, is to begin from the beauties of earth and mount upwards for the sake of that other beauty, using these steps only, and from one going on to two, and from two to all fair forms to fair practices, and from fair practices to fair notions, until from fair notions he arrives at the notion of absolute beauty, and at last knows what the essence of beauty is.","Let us affirm what seems to be the truth, that, whether one is or is not, one and the others in relation to themselves and one another, all of them, in every way, are and are not, and appear to be and appear not to be.","Nothing more excellent or valuable than wine was every granted by the gods to man.","I must yield to you, for you are irresistible.","Wonder [said Socrates] is very much the affection of a philosopher; for there is no other beginning of philosophy than this.","Cooking is a form of flattery....a mischievous, deceitful, mean and ignoble activity, which cheats us by shapes and colors, by smoothing and draping.","We must now examine whether just people also live better and are happier than unjust ones. I think it\'s clear already that this is so, but we must look into it further, since the argument concerns no ordinary topic, but the way we ought to live.","Either we shall find what it is we are seeking or at least we shall free ourselves from the persuasion that we know what we do not know.","There is far greater peril in buying knowledge than in buying meat and drink.","We are too feeble and sluggish to make our way out to the upper limit of the air. If someone could reach the summit, or put on wings and fly aloft, when he put up his head he would see the world above, just as fishes see our world when they put up their heads out of the sea; and if his nature were able to bear the sight, he would recognize that that is the true heaven.","Twice and thrice over, as they say, good is it to repeat and review what is good.","The honour of parents is a fair and noble treasure to their posterity, but to have the use of a treasure of wealth and honour, and to leave none to your successors, because you have neither money nor reputation of your own, is alike base and dishonourable.","Don\'t ask a poet to explain himself.

Are you looking to any other standard but pleasure and pain when you call them good?","The heaviest penalty for deciding to engage in politics is to be ruled by someone inferior to yourself.","Democracy does not contain any force which will check the constant tendency to put more and more on the public payroll. The state is like a hive of bees in which the drones display, multiply and starve the workers so the idlers will consume the food and the workers will perish.","Madness, provided it comes as the gift of heaven, is the channel by which we receive the greatest blessings... the men of old who gave things their names saw no disgrace or reproach in madness; otherwise they would not have connected it with the name of the noblest of arts, the art of discerning the future, and called it the manic art... So, according to the evidence provided by our ancestors, madness is a nobler thing than sober sense... madness comes from God, whereas sober sense is merely human.","O youth or young man, who fancy that you are neglected by the gods, know that if you become worse, you shall go to worse souls, or if better to the better...  In every succession of life and death, you will do and suffer what like may fitly suffer at the hands of like.

For what lover would not choose rather to be seen by all mankind than by his beloved, either when abandoning his post or throwing away his arms? He would be ready to die a thousand deaths rather than endure this.","God ever geometrizes.","They deem him their worst enemy who tells them the truth.","It is impossible to conceive of many without one.","Mariner, do not ask whose tomb this may be, but go with good fortune: I wish you a kinder sea.","The truth is that we isolate a particular kind of love and appropriate it for the name of love, which really belongs to a wider whole.","In heaven there is laid up a pattern which he who chooses may behold, and beholding, set his own house in order. The time has now arrived at which they must raise the eye of the soul to the Universal Light which lightens all things. With the eye ever directed toward things fixed and immutable which neither injure nor are injured - these they cannot help imitating. But I quite admit the difficulty of believing that in every man there is an eye of the soul which by the right direction is re-illumined, and is more precious far than ten thousand bodily eyes.","Of all the Gods, Love is the best friend of humankind, the helper and healer of all ills that stand in the way of human happiness.","There are few people so stubborn in their atheism who, when danger is pressing in, will not acknowledge the divine power.","Virtue is relative to the actions and ages of each of us in all that we do.","Those who have knowledge are more confident than those who have no knowledge, and they are more confident after they have learned than before.","Wherever it has been established that it is shameful to be involved with sexual relationships with men, that is due to evil on the part of the rulers, and to cowardice on the part of the governed.","Those having torches will pass them on to others.","When there is an income tax, the just man will pay more and the unjust less on the same amount of income.","We ought to esteem it of the greatest importance that the fictions which children first hear should be adapted in the most perfect manner to the promotion of virtue.","Wealth does not bring excellence, but that wealth comes from excellence.","... our purpose in founding our state was not to promote the happiness of a single class, but, so far as possible, of the whole community. Our idea was that we were most likely to justice in such a community, and so be able to decide the question we are trying to answer. We are therefore at the moment trying to construct what we think is a happy community by securing the happiness not of a select minority, but of a whole.","Hereditary honors are a noble and a splendid treasure to descendants.","And may we not say, Adeimantus, that the most gifted minds, when they are ill- educated, become the worst?","You may be sure, dear Crito, that inaccurate language is not only in itself a mistake: it implants evil in men\'s souls.","In the world of knowledge, the essential Form of Good is the limit of our inquiries, and can barely be perceived; but, when perceived, we cannot help concluding that it is in every case the source of all that is bright and beautiful -in the visible world giving birth to light and its master, and in the intellectual world dispensing, immediately and with full authority, truth and reason -and that whosoever would act wisely, either in private or in public, must set this Form of Good before his eyes.","The most important part of education is right training in the nursery. The soul of the child in his play should be trained to that sort of excellence in which, when he grows to manhood, he will have to be perfected.","One should turn towards the main ocean of the-beautiful-in-the-world so that one may by, contemplation of this Form, bring forth in all their splendor many fair fruits of discourse and meditation in a plenteous crop of philosophy.","Wealth is well known to be a great comforter.","...the Gods too love a joke.","Man never legislates,but destinies and accidents,happening in all sorts of ways,legislate in all sorts of ways.","I don\'t know anything that gives me greater pleasure, or profit either, than talking or listening to philosophy. But when it comes to ordinary conversation, such as the stuff you talk about financiers and the money market, well, I find it pretty tiresome personally, and I feel sorry that my friends should think they\'re being very busy when they\'re really doing absolutely nothing. Of course, I know your idea of me: you think I\'m just a poor unfortunate, and I shouldn\'t wonder if your right.

For he has proved that for his part he will do anything for anybody with a view to virtue and improvement, than which there can be nothing nobler.","Our need will be the real creator.","Equals, the proverb goes, delight in equals.","Was not this ... what we spoke of as the great advantage of wisdom -- to know what is known and what is unknown to us?","Much more wretched than lackof health inthe body, it is to dwell with a soul that is not healthy, but corrupt.","We will be better and braver if we engage and inquire than if we indulge in \\nthe idle fancy that we already know -- or that it is of no use seeking to \\nknow what we do not know.","There is no other start to philosophy but wonder.","He who advises a sick man, whose manner of life is prejudicial to health, is clearly bound first of all to change his patient\'s manner of life.","Sin is disease, deformity, and weakness.","The wisest of you men is he who has realized, like Socrates, that in respect of wisdom he is really worthless.","In the world of knowledge, the idea of good appears last of all, and is seen only with effort.","A man who is good for anything ought not to calculate the chance of living or dying; he ought only to consider whether in doing anything he is doing right or wrong - acting the part of a good man or of a bad.","Would that I were the heaven, that I might be all full of love-lit eyes to gaze on thee.","Fields and trees are not willing to teach me anything; but this can be effected by men residing in the city.","Health is a consumation of a love affair of all the organs of the body.","The physician, to the extent he is a physician, considers only the good of the patient in what he prescribes, and his own not at all","All things are in fate, yet all things are not decreed by fate.","In good speaking, should not the mind of the speaker know the truth of the matter about which he is to speak.","May not the wolf, as the proverb says, claim a hearing?","Every man is a poet when he is in love.","If in a discussion of many matters ... we are not able to give perfectly exact and self-consistent accounts, do not be surprised: rather we would be content if we provide accounts that are second to none in probability.","We must, if we are to be consistent, and if we re to have a real pedigree herd, mate the best of our men with the best of our women as often as possible, and the inferior men with the inferior women as seldom as possible, and keep only the offspring of the best.","There is no such thing as a lovers\' oath.","for a poet is a light and winged thing, and holy, and never able to compose until he has become inspired, and is beside himself, and reason is no longer in him.","Music is that which takes silence and brings it to life.","In a democracy only will the freeman of nature design to dwell.","For when there are no words, it is very difficult to recognize the meaning of the harmony and rhythm, or to see any worldly object is imitated by them.","One trait in the philosopher\'s character we can assume is his love of the knowledge that reveals eternal reality, the realm unaffected by change and decay.","He who without the Muse\'s madness in his soul comes knocking at the door of poesy and thinks that art will make him anything fit to be called a poet, finds that the poetry which he indites in his sober senses is beaten hollow by the poetry of madmen.","They assembled together and dedicated these as the first-fruits of their love to Apollo in his Delphic temple, inscribing there those maxims which are on every tongue- \'know thyselP and \'Nothing overmuch.\'","A state arises,as I conceive,out of the needs of mankind;no one is self-sufficing,but all of us have many wants","As wolves love lambs so lovers love their loves.","[Aristotle] was the most eminent of all the pupils of Plato....

And now I depart, condemned by you to death; but they condemned by truth, as guilty of iniquity and injustice: and I abide my sentence, and so do they. These things, perhaps, ought so to be, and I think that they are for the best.","How well I remember the aged poet Sophocles, when in answer to the question, \\"How does love suit with age, Sophocles - are you still the man you were?\\" he replied, \\"Peace, most gladly have I escaped the thing of which you speak; I feel as if I had escaped from a mad and furious master.\\"","The greater part of instruction is being reminded of things you already know.","A certain portion of mankind do not believe at all in the existence of the gods.","The elements of instruction should be presented to the mind in childhood, but not with any compulsion.","Every unjust man is unjust against his will.","Any peace is better than any war","Interference by the three classes with each other s jobs, and interchange of jobs between them, therefore, does the greatest harm to our state, and we are entirely justified in calling it the worst of evils.","Even the good artisans fell into the same error as the poets; because they were good workmen they thought that they also knew all sorts of high matters, and this defect in them overshadowed their wisdom.","I am not given to finding fault, for there are innumerable fools.","They ought to be gentle to their friends and dangerous to their enemies.","Virtue is the desire of things honourable and the power of attaining them.","Just as things in a picture, when viewed from a distance, appear to be all in one and the same condition and alike.","The beginning is the chiefest part of any work.","If the head and the body are to be well, you must begin by curing the soul.","And the true order of going, or being led by another, to the things of love, is to begin from the beauties of earth.","Arithmetic is a kind of knowledge in which the best natures should be trained, and which must not be given up.","May I deem the wise man rich, and may I have such a portion of gold as none but a prudent man can either bear or employ.","Thinking and spoken discourse are the same thing, except that what we call thinking is, precisely, the inward dialogue carried on by the mind with itself without spoken sound.","Remember our words, then, and whatever is your aim let virtue be the condition of the attainment of your aim, and know that without this all possessions and pursuits are dishonourable and evil.","When the citizens of a society can see and hear their leaders, then that society should be seen as one.","Do thine own work, and know thyself.","The true runner comes to the finish and receives the prize and is crowned.","Socrates said that, from above, the Earth looks like one of those twelve-patched leathern balls.","Madness comes from God, whereas sober sense is merely human.","The greatest penalty of evil-doing is to grow into the likeness of bad men, and, growing like them, to fly from the conversation of the good, and be cut off from them, and cleave to and follow after the company of the bad.","\'But surely \\"blind\\" is just how you would describe men who have no true knowledge of reality, and no clear standard in their mind to refer to, as a painter refers to his model, and which they can study closely before they start laying down rules about what is fair or right or good where they are needed, or maintaining, as Guardians, any rules that already exist.\' \\n\'Yes, blind is just about what they are\'","To honor with hymns and panegyrics those who are still alive is not safe; a man should run his course and make a fair ending, and then we will praise him; and let praise be given equally to women as well as men who have been distinguished in virtue.","The doctors will treat those of your citizens whose physical and psychological constitution is good: as for the others, they will leave the unhealthy to die and those whose psychological constitution is incurably warped they will be put to death.","Is it not also true that no physician, in so far as he is a physician, considers or enjoins what is for the physician\'s interest, but that all seek the good of their patients? For we have agreed that a physician strictly so called, is a ruler of bodies, and not a maker of money, have we not?","Until philosophers hold power, neither states nor individuals will have rest from trouble.","The ludicrous state of solid geometry made me pass over this branch.","Serious things cannot be understood without laughable things, nor opposites at all without opposites.","It is proper for every one to consider, in the case of all men, that he who has not been a servant cannot become a praiseworthy master; and it is meet that we should plume ourselves rather on acting the part of a servant properly than that of the master, first, towards the laws, (for in this way we are servants of the gods), and next, towards our elders.","For just as poets love their own works, and fathers their own children, in the same way those who have created a fortune value their money, not merely for its uses, like other persons, but because it is their own production. This makes them moreover disagreeable companions, because they will praise nothing but riches.","Seven years of silent inquiry are needful for a man to learn the truth, but fourteen in order to learn how to make it known to his fellow-men.","Whenever a person strives, by the help of dialectic, to start in pursuit of every reality by a simple process of reason, independent of all sensuous information - never flinching, until by an act of the pure intelligence he has grasped the real nature of good - he arrives at the very end of the intellectual world.","Philosophy is an elegant thing, if anyone modestly meddles with it; but if they are conversant with it more than is becoming, it corrupts them.","And yet the artist will go on with his work without knowing in some way if any of his representations are sound or unsound.

And the smallest class is the one which naturally possesses that form of knowledge which alone of all others deserves the title of wisdom.","No one knows whether death may not be the greatest good that can happen to man.","We ought to fly away from earth to heaven as quickly as we can; and to fly away is to become like God, as far as this is possible; and to become like him is to become holy, just, and wise.","The love of the gods belongs to anyone who has given to true virtue and nourished it, and if any human being could become immortal, it would be he.","But that we shall be better and braver and less helpless if we think that we ought to enquire, than we should have been if we indulged in the idle fancy that there was no knowing and no use in seeking to know what we do not know; - that is a theme upon which I am ready to fight, in word and deed, to the utmost of my power.","Evil is the vulgar lover who loves the body rather than the soul, inasmuch as he is not even stable, because he loves a thing which is in itself unstable, and therefore when the bloom of youth which he was desiring is over, he takes wing and flies away, in spite of all his words and promises; whereas the love of the noble disposition is life-long, for it becomes one with the everlasting.","Consider how great is the encouragement which all the world gives to the lover; neither is he supposed to be doing anything dishonourable; but if he succeeds he is praised, and if he fail he is blamed.","When two friends are in the mood to chat, we have to go about it in a gentler and more dialectical way. By \'more dialectical,\' I mean not only that we give real responses, but that we base our responses solely on what the interlocutor admits that he himself knows.","But of the heaven which is above the heavens, what earthly poet ever did or ever will sing worthily?","There is no necessity for the man who means to be an orator to understand what is really just but only what would appear so to the majority of those who will give judgment; and not what is really good or beautiful but whatever will appear so; because persuasion comes from that and not from the truth.","The true champion of justice, if he intends to survive even for a short time, must necessarily confine himself to private life and leave politics alone.","As a breath of wind or some echo rebounds from smooth, hard surfaces and returns to the source from which it issued, so the stream of beauty passes back into its possessor through his eyes, which is its natural route to the soul; arriving there and setting him all aflutter, it waters the passages of the feathers and causes the wings to grow, and fills the soul of the loved one in his turn with love.","To fear death, gentlemen, is no other then to think oneself wise when one is not, to think one knows what one does not know.","Each living creature is said to be alive and to be the same individual - as for example someone is said to be the same person from when he is a child until he comes to be an old man. And yet, if he\'s called the same, that\'s despite the fact that he\'s never made up from the same things, but is always being renewed, and losing what he had before, whether it\'s hair, or flesh, or bones, or blood, in fact the whole body.","If anyone comes to the gates of poetry and expects to become an adequate poet by acquiring expert knowledge of the subject without the Muses\' madness, he will fail, and his self-controlled verses will be eclipsed by the poetry of men who have been driven out of their minds.","Love is a great spirit. Everything spiritual is in between god and mortal.","According to Diotima, Love is not a god at all, but is rather a spirit that mediates between people and the objects of their desire. Love is neither wise nor beautiful, but is rather the desire for wisdom and beauty.","All I would ask you to be thinking of is the truth and not Socrates.","And tell him it\'s quite true that the best of the philosophers are of no use to their fellows; but that he should blame, not the philosophers, but those who fail to make use of them.","He who is gracious to his lover under the impression that he is rich, and is disappointed of his gains because he turns out to be poor, is disgraced all the same: for he has done his best to show that he would give himself up to any one\'s \\"uses base\\" for the sake of money; but this is not honourable.","The tools which would teach men their own use would be beyond price.","People regard the same things, some as just and others as unjust, - about these they dispute; and so there arise wars and fightings among them.","It is correct to make a priority of young people, taking care that they turn out as well as possible.","By the golden chain Homer meant nothing else than the sun.","What essence is to generation, that truth is to belief.","Everything that deceives does so by casting a spell.","Athenian men, I respect and love you, but I shall obey the god rather than you.","Where it is a general rule that it is wrong to gratify lovers, this can be attributed to the defects of those who make that rule: the government\'s lust for rule and the subjects\' cowardice.","[Not enough is known about solid geometry] and for two reasons: in the first place, no government places value on it; this leads to a lack of energy in the pursuit of it, and it is difficult. In the second place, students cannot learn it unless they have a teacher. But then a teacher can hardly be found.","Other people are likely not to be aware that those who pursue philosophy aright study nothing but dying and being dead. Now if this is true, it would be absurd to be eager for nothing but this all their lives, and then to be troubled when that came for which they had all along been eagerly practicing.","Where reverence is, there is fear; for he who has a feeling of reverence and shame about the commission of any action, fears and is afraid of an ill reputation.","There is yet something remaining for the dead, and some far better thing for the good than for the evil.","The love, more especially, which is concerned with the good, and which is perfected in company with temperance and justice, whether among gods or men, has the greatest power, and is the source of all our happiness and harmony, and makes us friends with the gods who are above us, and with one another.","Truthfulness. He will never willingly tolerate an untruth, but will hate it as much as he loves truth... And is there anything more closely connected with wisdom than truth?","Those who are not schooled and practised in truth [who are not honest and upright men] can never manage aright the government, nor yet can those who spend their lives as closet philosophers; because the former have no high purpose to guide their actions, while the latter keep aloof from public life.","Is virtue something that can be taught?","The like is not the friend of the like in as far as he is like; still the good may be the friend of the good in as far as he is good.","Our greatest blessings come to us by way of madness, provided the madness is given us by divine gift.","Then not only custom, but also nature affirms that to do is more disgraceful than to suffer injustice, and that justice is equality.","The good are like one another, and friends to one another; and ... the bad, as is often said of them, are never at unity with one another or with themselves, but are passionate and restless: and that which is at variance and enmity with itself is not likely to be in union or harmony with any other thing.","All soul is immortal. For that which is always in movement is immortal; that which moves something else, and is moved by something else, in ceasing from movement ceases from living. So only that which moves itself, because it does not abandon itself, never stops moving. But it is also source and first principle of movement for the other things which move.","That makes me think, my friend, as I have often done before, how natural it is that those who have spent a long time in the study of philosophy appear ridiculous when they enter the courts of law as speakers. Those who have knocked about in courts and the like from their youth up seem to me, when compared with those who have been brought up in philosophy and similar pursuits, to be as slaves in breeding compared with freemen.","I take it that our state, having been founded and built up on the right lines, is good in the complete sense of the word.","We ought to live sacrificing, and singing, and dancing.","Much sleep is not required by nature, either for our souls or bodies, or for the action in which they are concerned.","For though a man should be a complete unbeliever in the being of gods; if he also has a native uprightness of temper, such persons will detest evil in men; their repugnance to wrong disinclines them to commit wrongful acts; they shun the unrighteous and are drawn to the upright.","From all wild beasts, a child is the most difficult to handle.","He seemeth to be most ignorant that trusteth most to his wit.","Now nothing can be more important than that the work of a soldier should be well done.","And the first step, as you know, is always what matters most, particularly when we are dealing with those who are young and tender. That is the time when they are taking shape and when any impression we choose to make leaves a permanent mark.",". . . the triumph of my art is in thoroughly examining whether the thought which the mind of the young man brings forth is a false idol or a noble and true birth.","Violent pleasures which reach the soul through the body are generally of this sort-they are reliefs of pain.","If the study of all these sciences which we have enumerated, should ever bring us to their mutual association and relationship, and teach us the nature of the ties which bind them together, I believe that the diligent treatment of them will forward the objects which we have in view, and that the labor, which otherwise would be fruitless, will be well bestowed.","Shall we not, then, lay down a law, in the first place, that boys shall abstain altogether from wine till their eighteenth year, thereby teaching that it is wrong to add fire to fire, as through a funnel, pouring it into their body and soul before they proceed to the labor of life, thus exercising a caution as to the maddening habits of youth.","The god is the beautiful.","You cannot conceive the many without the one...The study of the unit is among those that lead the mind on and turn it to the vision of reality.","The poets are nothing but interpreters of the gods, each one possessed by the divinity to whom he is in bondage.","What I say is that \'just\' or \'right\' means nothing but what is in the interest of the stronger party.","The well-nurtured youth is one who would see most clearly whatever was amiss in ill-made works of man or ill-grown works of nature, and with a just distaste would blame and hate the ugly even from his earliest years and would give delighted praise to beauty, receiving it into his soul and being nourished by it, so that he became a man of gentle heart.","Man is a prisoner who has no right to open the door of his prison and run away... A man should wait, and not take his own life until God summons him.","A person who is good for anything ought not to calculate the chance of living or dying; he or she ought only to consider whether in doing anything he or she is doing right or wrong- acting the part of a good person or a bad person.","For he who would proceed aright... should begin in youth to visit beautiful forms... out of that he should create fair thoughts; and soon he will of himself perceive that the beauty of one form is akin to the beauty of another, and that beauty in every form is one and the same.","You are mistaken, my friend, if you think that a man who is worth anything ought to spend his time weighing up the prospects of life and death. He has only one thing to consider in performing any action - that is, whether he is acting rightly or wrongly, like a good man or a bad one.","Haughtiness lives under the same roof with solitude.","Truth is the beginning of every good to the gods, and of every good to man.","Thus does the Muse herself move men divinely inspired, and through them thus inspired a Chain hangs together of others inspired divinely likewise.","The Graces sought some holy ground,\\nWhose sight should ever please;\\nAnd in their search the soul they found\\nOf Aristophanes.","Of all the things which a man has, next to the gods his soul is the most divine and most truly his own.","Being well satisfied that, for a man who thinks himself to be somebody, there is nothing more disgraceful than to hold himself up as honored, not on his own account, but for the sake of his forefathers. Yet hereditary honors are a noble and splendid treasure to descendants.","The natural function of the wing is to soar upwards and carry that which is heavy up to the place where dwells the race of gods. More than any other thing that pertains to the body it partakes of the nature of the divine.","Be kind, for everyone you meet is fighting a harder battle.","We can easily forgive a child who is afraid of the dark; the real tragedy of life is when men are afraid of the light.","The price good men pay for indifference to public affairs is to be ruled by evil men.","Do not train a child to learn by force or harshness; but direct them to it by what amuses their minds, so that you may be better able to discover with accuracy the peculiar bent of the genius of each.","The heaviest penalty for declining to rule is to be ruled by someone inferior to yourself.","Never discourage anyone...who continually makes progress, no matter how slow.","One of the penalties of refusing to participate in politics is that you end up being governed by your inferiors.","good people do not need laws to tell them to act responsibly, while bad people will find a way around the laws","Ignorance, the root and stem of every evil.","If women are expected to do the same work as men, we must teach them the same things.","...and when one of them meets the other half, the actual half of himself, whether he be a lover of youth or a lover of another sort, the pair are lost in an amazement of love and friendship and intimacy and one will not be out of the other\'s sight, as I may say, even for a moment...","The madness of love is the greatest of heaven\'s blessings.","Courage is knowing what not to fear.","There are two things a person should never be angry at, what they can help, and what they cannot.","When men speak ill of thee, live so as nobody may believe them.","The beginning is the most important part of the work.","The object of education is to teach us to love what is beautiful.","Those who are able to see beyond the shadows and lies of their culture will never be understood, let alone believed, by the masses.","Necessity is the mother of invention.","Death is not the worst that can happen to men.","Bodily exercise, when compulsory, does no harm to the body; but knowledge which is acquired under compulsion obtains no hold on the mind.","An empty vessel makes the loudest sound, so they that have the least wit are the greatest babblers.","Beauty lies in the eyes of the beholder","Character is simply habit long continued.","Musical innovation is full of danger to the State, for when modes of music change, the fundamental laws of the State always change with them.","You\'re my Star, a stargazer too,and I wish that I were Heaven,with a billion eyes to look at you!","Excellence\\" is not a gift, but a skill that takes practice.We do not act \\"rightly\\" because we are \\"excellent\\",in fact we achieve \\"excellence\\" by acting \\"rightly\\".","The soul takes nothing with her to the next world but her education and her culture.

What you have discovered is a recipe not for memory, but for reminder. And it is no true wisdom that you offer your disciples, but only its semblance, for by telling them of many things without teaching them you will make them seem to know much, while for the most part they know nothing, and as men filled, not with wisdom, but with the conceit of wisdom, they will be a burden to their fellows.","You know that the beginning is the most important part of any work, especially in the case of a young and tender thing; for that is the time at which the character is being formed and the desired impression is more readily taken....Shall we just carelessly allow children to hear any casual tales which may be devised by casual persons, and to receive into their minds ideas for the most part the very opposite of those which we should wish them to have when they are grown up?We cannot....Anything received into the mind at that age is likely to become indelible and unalterable; and therefore it is most important that the tales which the young first hear should be models of virtuous thoughts....","Musical training is a more potent instrument than any other, because rhythm and harmony find their way into the inward places of the soul.","The direction in which education starts a man will determine his future life","...when he looks at Beauty in the only way that Beauty can be seen - only then will it become possible for him to give birth not to images of virtue (because he\'s in touch with no images), but to true virtue [arete] (because he is in touch with true Beauty).

And he will count the one happy in his condition and state of being, and he will pity the other; or, if he have a mind to laugh at the soul which comes from below into the light, there will be more reason in this than in the laugh which greets him who returns from above out of the light into the den.

Once he\'s spent enough time in the creature\'s company to acquire all this information, he calls it knowledge, forms it into a systematic branch of expertise, and starts to teach it, despite total ignorance, in fact, about which of the creature\'s attitudes and desires is commendable or deplorable, good or bad, moral or immoral. His usage of all these terms simply conforms to the great beast\'s attitudes, and he describes things as good or bad according to its likes and dislikes, and can\'t justify his usage of the terms any further, but describes as right and good the things which are merely indispensable, since he hasn\'t realised and can\'t explain to anyone else how vast a gulf there is between necessity and goodness.","O dear Pan and all the other gods of this place, grant that I may be beautiful inside.

And yet, if he\'s called the same, that\'s despite the fact that he\'s never made up from the same things, but is always being renewed, and losing what he had before, whether it\'s hair, or flesh, or bones, or blood, in fact the whole body. And don\'t suppose that this is just true in the case of the body; in the case of the soul, too, its traits, habits, opinions, desires, pleasures, pains, fears-- none of these things is ever the same in any individual, but some are coming into existence, others passing away.","But afterwards there occurred violent earthquakes and floods; and in a single day and night of misfortune all your warlike men in a body sank into the earth, and the island of Atlantis in like manner disappeared in the depths of the sea.","A sensible man will remember that the eyes may be confused in two ways - by a change from light to darkness or from darkness to light; and he will recognise that the same thing happens to the soul.","Opinion is the medium between knowledge and ignorance","\u200eLove is a madness produced by an unsatisfiable rational desire to understand the ultimate truth about the world.","Appearance tyrannizes over truth.","And then, at this stage, every dictator comes up with the notorious and typical demand: he asks the people for bodyguards to protect him, the people\'s champion.","if you are willing to reflect on the courage and moderation of other people, you will find them strange...they all consider death a great evil...and the brave among them face death, when they do, for fear of greater evils...therefore, it is fear and terror that make all men brave, except for philosophers. yet it is illogical to be brave through fear and cowardice...what of the moderate among them? is their experience not similar?...they master certain pleasures because they are mastered by others...i fear this is not the right exchange to attain virtue, to exchange pleasures for pleasures, pains for pains, and fears for fears, the greater for the less like coins, but that they only valid currency for which all these things should be exchanged is wisdom.","No thing more excellent nor more valuable than wine was ever granted mankind by God.","Thinking: The talking of the soul with itself","They deem him their worst enemy who tells them the truth. -Plato, philosopher (427-347 BCE)","Time is the moving image of eternity.","This power came forth out of the Atlantic Ocean, for in those days the Atlantic was navigable; and there was an island situated in front of the straits which are by you called the Pillars of Heracles; the island was larger than Libya and Asia put together, and was the way to other islands, and from these you might pass to the whole of the opposite continent which surrounded the true ocean; for this sea which is within the Straits of Heracles is only a harbour, having a narrow entrance, but that other is a real sea, and the surrounding land may be most truly called a boundless continent. Now in this island of Atlantis there was a great and wonderful empire which had rule over the whole island and several others, and over parts of the continent, and, furthermore, the men of Atlantis had subjected the parts of Libya within the columns of Heracles as far as Egypt, and of Europe as far as Tyrrhenia. This vast power, gathered into one, endeavoured to subdue at a blow our country and yours and the whole of the region within the straits; and then, Solon, your country shone forth, in the excellence of her virtue and strength, among all mankind. She was pre-eminent in courage and military skill, and was the leader of the Hellenes. And when the rest fell off from her, being compelled to stand alone, after having undergone the very extremity of danger, she defeated and triumphed over the invaders, and preserved from slavery those who were not yet subjugated, and generously liberated all the rest of us who dwell within the pillars. But afterwards there occurred violent earthquakes and floods; and in a single day and night of misfortune all your warlike men in a body sank into the earth, and the island of Atlantis in like manner disappeared in the depths of the sea. For which reason the sea in those parts is impassable and impenetrable, because there is a shoal of mud in the way; and this was caused by the subsidence of the island.","Always be kind, for everyone is fighting a hard battle.","Si vis pacem, para bellum","The first and greatest victory is to conquer yourself; to be conquered by yourself is of all things most shameful and vile.","[T]hose who practice philosophy in the right way are in training for dying and they fear death least of all men.","Any one who has common sense will remember that the bewilderments of the eyes are of two kinds, and arise from two causes, either from coming out of the light or from going into the light","Your silence gives consent.","Music is a moral law.

It\'s as if there were two warring factions, with passion fighting on the side of reason. But I\'m sure you won\'t claim that you had ever, in yourself or in anyone else, met a case of passion siding with his desires against the rational mind, when the rational mind prohibits resistance.","So where it is a general rule that it is wrong to gratify lovers, this can be attributed to the defects of those who make that rule: the government\'s lust for rule and the subjects\' cowardice","Beauty of style and harmony and grace and good rhythm depend on simplicity \u2013 I mean the true simplicity of a rightly and nobly ordered mind and character, not that other simplicity which is only a euphemism for folly.","Even now I\'m well aware that if I allowed myself to listen to him I couldn\'t resist but would have the same experience again.

So the tyrant is a parricide, and little comfort to his old parent.","To the degree that I cease to persue my deepest passions, I will gradually be controlled by my deepest fears.","Similarly with regard to truth, won\'t we say that a soul is maimed if it hates a voluntary falsehood, cannot endure to have one in itself, and is greatly angered when it exists in others, but is nonetheless content to accept an involuntary falsehood, isn\'t angry when it is caught being ignorant, and bears its lack of learning easily, wallowing in it like a pig?","for the best possible state of your soul, as I say to you: Wealth does not bring about excellence, but excellence makes wealth and everything else good for men, both individually and collectively.","not exact, but: the two most important questions are; who will teach the children? what they teach them?","Whereas, our argument shows that the power and capacity of learning exists in the soul already; and that just as the eye was unable to turn from darkness to light without the whole body, so too the instrument of knowledge can only by the movement of the whole soul be turned from the world of becoming into that of being, and learn by degrees to endure the sight of being, and of the brightest and best of being, or in other words, of the good.","We can easily forgive a child who is afraid of the dark; the real tragedy of life is when men are afraid of the light. / Nije problem dijete koje se boji mraka; prava tragedija su odrasli koji se boje svjetla.","Courage is a kind of salvation.

For he who is gracious to his lover under the impression that he is rich, and is disappointed of his gains because he turns out to be poor, is disgraced all the same: for he has done his best to show that he would give himself up to any one\'s \\"uses base\\" for the sake of money; but this is not honourable. And on the same principle he who gives himself to a lover because he is a good man, and in the hope that he will be improved by his company, shows himself to be virtuous, even though the object of his affection turn out to be a villain, and to have no virtue; and if he is deceived he has committed a noble error. For he has proved that for his part he will do anything for anybody with a view to virtue and improvement, than which there can be nothing nobler.","States will never be happy until rulers become philosophers or philosophers become rulers.","I shall try to persuade first the Rulers and soldiers, and then the rest of the community, that the upbringing and education we have given them was all something that happened to them only in a dream.

So they bore the burden of their wealth and possessions lightly, and did not let their high standard of living intoxicate them or make them lose their self-control\u2026But when the divine element in them became weakened\u2026and their human traits became predominant, they ceased to be able to carry their prosperity with moderation.","...both wealth and concord decline as possessions become pursued and honored.

I mean haven\'t you ever fallen under the spell of poetry, Glaucon, especially when the spectacle is provided by Homer?","There\'s no chance of their having a conscious glimpse of the truth as long as they refuse to disturb the things they take for granted and remain incapable of explaining them. For if your starting-point is unknown, and your end-point and intermediate stages are woven together out of unknown material, there may be coherence, but knowledge is completely out of the question.","Must not all things at last be swallowed up in Death?","Not much time will be gained, O Athenians, in return for the evil name which you will get from the detractors of the city, who will say that you killed Socrates, a wise man; for they will call me wise even although I am not wise when they want to reproach you. If you had waited a little while, your desire would have been fulfilled in the course of nature. For I am far advanced in years, as you may perceive, and not far from death. I am speaking now only to those of you who have condemned me to death. And I have another thing to say to them: You think that I was convicted through deficiency of words - I mean, that if I had thought fit to leave nothing undone, nothing unsaid, I might have gained an acquittal. Not so; the deficiency which led to my conviction was not of words - certainly not. But I had not the boldness or impudence or inclination to address you as you would have liked me to address you, weeping and wailing and lamenting, and saying and doing many things which you have been accustomed to hear from others, and which, as I say, are unworthy of me. But I thought that I ought not to do anything common or mean in the hour of danger: nor do I now repent of the manner of my defence, and I would rather die having spoken after my manner, than speak in your manner and live. For neither in war nor yet at law ought any man to use every way of escaping death. For often in battle there is no doubt that if a man will throw away his arms, and fall on his knees before his pursuers, he may escape death; and in other dangers there are other ways of escaping death, if a man is willing to say and do anything. The difficulty, my friends, is not in avoiding death, but in avoiding unrighteousness; for that runs faster than death. I am old and move slowly, and the slower runner has overtaken me, and my accusers are keen and quick, and the faster runner, who is unrighteousness, has overtaken them. And now I depart hence condemned by you to suffer the penalty of death, and they, too, go their ways condemned by the truth to suffer the penalty of villainy and wrong; and I must abide by my award - let them abide by theirs. I suppose that these things may be regarded as fated, - and I think that they are well.","You take the words in the sense which is most damaging to the argument.","Human nature was originally one and we were a whole, and the pursuit of the whole is called love.","Men of Athens, I honor and I love you, but I will obey the god rather than you and as long as I draw breath and am able, I shall not cease to practice philosophy, to exhort you and in my usual way to point out to any one of you whom I happen to meet.","A poet, you see, is a light thing, and winged and holy, and cannot compose before he gets inspiration and loses control of his senses and his reason has deserted him.","According to Greek mythology, humans were orginally created with four arms, four legs and a head with two faces. Fearing their power, Zeus split them in two seperate beings, condeming them to spend their lives in search of their other halves.","if someone got to see the Beautiful itself, absolute, pure, unmixed, not polluted by human flesh or colors or any other great nonsense of mortality, but if he could see the divine Beauty itself in its one form? Do you think it would be a poor life for a human being to look there and to behold it by that which he ought, and to be with it? Or haven\'t you remembered that in that life alone, when he looks at Beauty in the only way what Beauty can be seen - only then will it become possible for him to give birth no to images of virtue but to true virtue. The love of the gods belongs to anyone who has given birth to true virtue and nourished it, and if any human being could become immortal, it would be he.","...we must go where the argument carries us, as a vessel runs before the wind.","Every king springs from a race of slaves, and every slave had kings among his ancestors.","Reality is created by the mind. We can change our reality by changing our mind.","By such reflections and by the continuance in them of a divine nature, th qualities which we have described grew and increased among them; but when the divine portion began to fade away, and became diluted too often and too much with the mortal admixture, and the human nature got the upper hand, they then, being unable to bear their fortune, behaved unseemly, and to him who had an eye to see grew visibly debased, for they were losing the fairest of their precious gifts; but to those who had no eye to see the true happiness, they appeared glorious and blessed at the very time when they were full of avarice and unrighteous power. Zeus, the god of gods, who rules according to law, and is able to see into such things, perceiving that an honourable race was in a woeful plight, and wanting to inflict punishment on them, that they might be chastened and improve, collected all the gods into their most holy habitation, whch being placed in the centre of the world, beholds all created things.

Human causes didn\'t enter into it; I was prevented by some divine being, the effect of which you\'ll hear later on. But now it no longer prevents me, so here I am. I\'m confident it won\'t prevent me in future either.","It is impossible to improve the world if first the man does not improve","The best is to do injustice without paying the penalty; the worst is to suffer it without being able to take revenge. Justice is a mean between these two extremes. People value it not because it is a good but because they are too weak to do injustice with impunity.","Any one who has common sense will remember that the bewilderments of the eyes are of two kinds, and arise from two causes, either from coming out of the light or from going into the light, which is true of the mind\'s eye, quite as much as of the bodily eye","And if there were only some way of contriving that a state or an army should be made up of lovers and their beloved, they would be the very best governors of their own city, abstaining from all dishonour, and emulating one another in honour; and when fighting at each other\'s side, although a mere handful, they would overcome the world. For what lover would not choose rather to be seen by all mankind than by his beloved, either when abandoning his post or throwing away his arms? He would be ready to die a thousand deaths rather than endure this. Or who would desert his beloved or fail him in the hour of danger?","The rhetorician need not know the truth about things; he has only to discover some way of persuading the ignorant that he has more knowledge than those who know.","The beginning is the most important part of any work.","Wars and revolutions and battles, you see, are due simply and solely to the body and its desires.

Hatred of arguments and hatred of human beings come about in the same way. For hatred of human beings arises from artlessly trusting somebody to excess, and believing that human being to be in every way true and sound and trustworthy, and then a little later discovering that this person is wicked and untrustworthy - and then having this experience again with another. And whenever somebody experiences this many times, and especially at the hands of just those he might regard as his most intimate friends and comrades, he then ends up taking offense all the time and hates all human beings and believes there\'s nothing at all sound in anybody.","If you harm a horse do you make him better or worse?\\"\\"Worse.","And I think that you must have observed again and again what a poor appearance the tales of poets make when stripped of the colours which music puts upon them, and recited in simple prose.","... because it is correct to make a priority of young people, taking care that they turn out as well as possible...","Beauty is the splendor of truth.(Die Sch\xf6nheit ist der Glanz der Wahrheit)","I say that justice is nothing other than the advantage of [c] the stronger.","Socrates: I\'m afraid that it might actually be sacrilegious to stand idly by while morality is being denigrated and not try to assist as long as one has breath in one\'s body and a voice to protest with.","Rather I think that a man who ... is willing ... to value learning as long as he lives, not supposing that old age brings him wisdom of itself, will necessarily pay more attention to the rest of his life.","I pity you who are my companions, because you think that you are doing something when in reality you are doing nothing.","Socrates: But why, my dear Crito, should we care about the opinion of the many?","Then we got into a labyrinth, and, when we thought we were at the end,came out again at the beginning, having still to see as much as ever.","Star of my life, to the stars your face is turned;Would I were the heavens, looking back at you with ten thousand eyes.","[Dialogue between Solon and an Egyptian Priest]In the Egyptian Delta, at the head of which the river Nile divides, there is a certain district which is called the district of Sais [...] To this city came Solon, and was received there with great honour; he asked the priests who were most skilful in such matters, about antiquity, and made the discovery that neither he nor any other Hellene knew anything worth mentioning about the times of old. On one occasion, wishing to draw them on to speak of antiquity, he began to tell about the most ancient things in our part of the world-about Phoroneus, who is called \\"the first man,\\" and about Niobe; and after the Deluge, of the survival of Deucalion and Pyrrha; and he traced the genealogy of their descendants, and reckoning up the dates, tried to compute how many years ago the events of which he was speaking happened. Thereupon one of the priests, who was of a very great age, said: O Solon, Solon, you Hellenes are never anything but children, and there is not an old man among you. Solon in return asked him what he meant. I mean to say, he replied, that in mind you are all young; there is no old opinion handed down among you by ancient tradition, nor any science which is hoary with age.","Since then, as philosophers prove, appearance tyrannizes over truth and is lord of happiness, to appearance I must devote myself.","We can easily forget a child who is afraid of the dark.

I am ashamed to tell you the truth, gentlemen, but I must. Almost all the bystanders might have explained the poems better than their authors could. I soon realized that poets do not compose their poems with knowledge, but by some inborn talent and by inspiration, like seers and prophets who also say many fine things without any understanding of what they say.","And will life be worth having, if that higher part of man be destroyed, which is improved by justice and depraved by injustice?","I am speaking like a book, but I believe that what I am saying is true.","The lesser mysteries of loveFor he who would proceed aright in this matter should begin in youth to visit beautiful form; and first, if he be guided by his instructor aright, to love one such form only--out of that he should create fair thoughts; and soon he will of himself perceive that the beauty of one form is akin to the beauty of another; and then if beauty of form in general is his pursuit, how foolish would he be not to recognize that the beauty in every form is one and the same! And when he perceives this he will abate his violent love of the one, which he will despise and deem a small thing, and will become a lover of all beautiful forms; in the next stage he will consider that the beauty of the mind is more honorable than the beauty of the outward form.","I certainly have many enemies, and this is what will be my destruction if I am destroyed; of that I am certain; not Meletus, nor yet Anytus, but the envy and detraction of the world, which has been the death of many good men, and will probably be the death of many more; there is no danger of my being the last of them.","For no man is voluntarily bad; but the bad become bad by reason of an ill disposition of the body and bad education, things which are hateful to every man and happen to him against his will.","Unless, said I, either philosophers become kings in our states or those whom we now call our kings and rulers take to the pursuit of philosophy seriously and adequately, and there is a conjunction of these two things, political power and philosophic intellgence, while the motley horde of the natures who at present pursue either apart from the other are compulsory excluded, there can be no cessation of troubles, dear Glaucon, for our states, nor, I fancy, for the human race either.

After he found this out he managed to be appointed one of the messengers to the king; when he got there, he seduced the king\'s wife, and with her set upon the king, and killed him, and seized the empire. Then if there could be two such rings, and if the just man put one on and the unjust the other, no one, as it would be thought, would be so adamantine as to abide in the practice of justice, no one could endure to hold back from another\'s goods and not to touch, when it was in his power to take what he would even out of the market without fear, and to go into any house and lie with anyone he wished, and to kill or set free from prison those he might wish, and to do anything else in the world like a very god. And in doing so he would do just the same as the other; both would go the same way. Surely one would call this a strong proof that no one is just willingly but only under a strong compulsion, believing that it is not a good to him personally; since wherever each thinks he will be able to do injustice, he does injustice.","kata-kata tanpa ketulusan bukan hanya buruk, tapi juga merusak jiwa","those who govern ought not to be lovers of the task? For, if they are, there will be rival lovers, and they will fight.","They say that to do injustice is, by nature, good; to suffer injustice, evil, but that the evil is greater than the good. And so when men have both done and suffered injustice and have had experience of both, not being able to avoid the one and obtain the other, they think that they had better agree among themselves to have neither; hence there arise laws and mutual covenants, and that which is ordained by law is termed by them lawful and just. This they affirm to be the origin and nature of justice, it is a mean or compromise, between the best of all, which is to do injustice and not be punished, and the worst of all, which is to suffer injustice without the power of retaliation, and justice, being at a middle point between the two, is tolerated not as a good, but as the lesser evil, and honored by reason of the inability of me to do injustice. For no man who is worthy to be called a man would ever submit to such an agreement if he were able to resist; he would be mad if he did.","Haven\'t you noticed that opinion without knowledge is always a poor thing?

The truth is, Socrates, that these regrets, and also the complaints about relations, are to be attributed to the same cause, which is not old age, but men\'s characters and tempers; for he who is of a calm and happy nature will hardly feel the pressure of age, but to him who is of an opposite disposition youth and age are equally a burden.","Hope,\' he says, \'cherishes the soul of him who lives in justice and holiness, and is the nurse of his age and the companion of his journey;\u2014hope which is mightiest to sway the restless soul of man.","this is the greatest good to man, to discourse daily on virtue, and other things which you have heard me discussing, examining both myself and others,","Light is the shadow of god","\u0641\u0644\u0627 \u064a\u0646\u0628\u063a\u064a \u0644\u0623\u062d\u062f \u0627\u0646 \u064a\u0646\u0633\u0627\u0642 \u0644\u0631\u0623\u064a \u0627\u0644\u0646\u0627\u0633 \u0625\u0646 \u0643\u0627\u0646 \u0645\u062e\u0627\u0644\u0641\u0627 \u0644\u0644\u0639\u0642\u0644","For the plan grows under the author\'s hand; new thoughts occur to him in the act of writing; he has not worked out the argument to the end before he begins.","For this,\\" he said, \\"is the great error of our day in the treatment of the human body, that physicians separate the soul from the body.","The State is like a great and noble steed who is tardy in his motions owing to his very size, and requires to be stirred into life.

You will not easily find another like me.","For mankind censure injustice, fearing that they may be the victims of it and not because they shrink from committing it. And thus, as I have shown, Socrates, injustice, when on a sufficient scale, has more strength and freedom and mastery than justice; and, as I said at first, justice is the interest of the stronger, whereas injustice is a man\'s own profit and interest. Thrasymachus,","Friends have all things in common.","Today Learner is Tomorrow Leader","So if anyone is to declare how the all was in this way genuinely born, he must also mix in the form of the wandering cause-how it is its nature to sweep things around.

The offsprings of painting stand there as if they are alive, but if anyone asks them anything, they remain most solemnly silent. The same is true of written words. You\'d think they were speaking as if they had some understanding, but if you question anything that has been said because you want to learn more, it continues to signify just that very same thing forever. When it has once been written down, every discourse rolls about everywhere, reaching indiscriminately those with understanding no less than those who have no business with it, and it doesn\'t know to whom it should speak and to whom it should not. And when it is faulted and attacked unfairly, it always needs its father\'s support; alone, it can neither defend itself nor come to its own support.

But one of them exceeds all the rest in greatness and valour. For these histories tell of a mighty power which unprovoked made an expedition against the whole of Europe and Asia, and to which your city put an end. This power came forth out of the Atlantic Ocean, for in those days the Atlantic was navigable; and there was an island situated in front of the straits which are by you called the Pillars of Heracles; the island was larger than Libya and Asia put together, and was the way to other islands, and from these you might pass to the whole of the opposite continent which surrounded the true ocean; for this sea which is within the Straits of Heracles is only a harbour, having a narrow entrance, but that other is a real sea, and the surrounding land may be most truly called a boundless continent. Now in this island of Atlantis there was a great and wonderful empire which had rule over the whole island and several others, and over parts of the continent, and, furthermore, the men of Atlantis had subjected the parts of Libya within the columns of Heracles as far as Egypt, and of Europe as far as Tyrrhenia. This vast power, gathered into one, endeavoured to subdue at a blow our country and yours and the whole of the region within the straits; and then, Solon, your country shone forth, in the excellence of her virtue and strength, among all mankind. She was pre-eminent in courage and military skill, and was the leader of the Hellenes. And when the rest fell off from her, being compelled to stand alone, after having undergone the very extremity of danger, she defeated and triumphed over the invaders, and preserved from slavery those who were not yet subjugated, and generously liberated all the rest of us who dwell within the pillars. But afterwards there occurred violent earthquakes and floods; and in a single day and night of misfortune all your warlike men in a body sank into the earth, and the island of Atlantis in like manner disappeared in the depths of the sea. For which reason the sea in those parts is impassable and impenetrable, because there is a shoal of mud in the way; and this was caused by the subsidence of the island.","Of course, he said, he who is of a certain nature, is like those who areof a certain nature; he who is not, not.","Eros guides us to Logos.","Men say that we ought not to enquire into the supreme God and the nature of the universe, nor busy ourselves in searching out the causes of things, and that such enquiries are impious; whereas the very opposite is the truth.","a man who is good for anything ought not to calculate the chance of living or dying; he ought only to consider whether in doing anything he is doing right or wrong - acting the part of a good man or of a bad.","if you think that a man who is any good at all should take into account the risk of life or death; he should look to this only in his action, whether what he does is right or wrong, whether he is acting life a good or a bad man.","The next thing I want to do is to make a prophecy to you, the ones who voted against me; I\u2019m now at that moment when human beings are most prone to turn prophet, when they\u2019re about to die.

And then, after a period of time, the usual inundation visits like a pestilence and leaves only those of you who are destitute of letters and education. And thus you have to begin over again as children and know nothing of what happened in ancient times either among us or among yourselves.\'\'As for those genealogies of yours which you have related to us, they are no better than tales of children; for in the first place, you remember one deluge only, whereas there were a number of them. And in the next place there dwelt in your land, which you do not know, the fairest and noblest race of men that ever lived of which you are but a seed or remnant. And this was not known to you because for many generations the survivors of that destruction made no records.\'[Spoken by a priest of Egypt]","Now actions vary according to the manner of their performance. Take, for example, that which we are now doing, drinking, singing and talking these actions are not in themselves either good or evil, but they turn out in this or that way according to the mode of performing them; and when well done they are good, and when wrongly done they are evil; and in like manner not every love, but only that which has a noble purpose, is noble and worthy of praise.","SOCRATES: What evidence could be appealed to, supposing we were asked at this very moment whether we are asleep or awake?THEAETETUS: Indeed, Socrates, I do not see by what evidence it is to be proved; for the two conditions correspond in every circumstance like exact counterparts.","Plato is widely believed to have been a student of Socrates and to have been deeply influenced by his teacher\'s unjust death. Plato\'s brilliance as a writer and thinker can be witnessed by reading his Socratic dialogues. Some of the dialogues, letters, and other works that are ascribed to him are considered spurious","I went down yesterday to the Piraeus with Glaucon the son of Ariston, that I might offer up my prayers to the goddess (Bendis, the Thracian Artemis.); and also because I wanted to see in what manner they would celebrate the festival, which was a new thing. I was delighted with the procession of the inhabitants; but that of the Thracians was equally, if not more, beautiful. When we had finished our prayers and viewed the spectacle, we turned in the direction of the city; and at that instant Polemarchus the son of Cephalus chanced to catch sight of us from a distance as we were starting on our way home, and told his servant to run and bid us wait for him. The servant took hold of me by the cloak behind, and said: Polemarchus desires you to wait.","Yet whenever someone comes upon his very own half then they are wondrously struck with affection and intimacy and love, and are practically unwilling to be separated from one another even for a short time. And it is they who stay together for life, and who wouldn\'t be able to say what they want to get for themselves from one another.","I must go beyond the dark world of sense information to the clear brilliance of the sunlight of the outside world. Once done, it becomes my duty to go back to the cave in order to illuminate the minds of those imprisoned in the \'darkness\' of sensory knowledge.","O youth or young man, who fancy that you are neglected by the Gods, know that if you become worse you shall go to the worse souls, or if better to the better, and in every succession of life and death you will do and suffer what like may fitly suffer at the hands of like. This is the justice of heaven.Plato","Fire, air, earth, and water are bodies and therefore solids, and solids are contained in planes, and plane rectilinear figures are made up of triangles.","And therefore, I said, Glaucon, musical training is a more potent instrument than any other, because rhythm and harmony find their way into the inward places of the soul, on which they mightily fasten, imparting grace, and making the soul of him who is rightly educated graceful, or of him who is ill-educated ungraceful; and also because he who has received this true education of the inner being will most shrewdly perceive omissions or faults in art and nature, and with a true taste, while he praises and rejoices over and receives into his soul the good, and becomes noble and good, he will justly blame and hate the bad, now in the days of his youth, even before he is able to know the reason why; and when reason comes he will recognize and salute the friend with whom his education has made him long familiar\u2026\u2026Thus much of music, which makes a fair ending; for what should be the end of music if not the love of beauty?","What of his beard? Are you not of Homer\'s opinion, who says Youth is most charming when the beard first appears?","the creative soul creates not children, but conceptions of wisdom and virtue,","Nothing could be more important than that the work of a soldier is well done. No tools will make a man a skilled workmen, or master of defense, or be of any use to him who has not learned how to handle them and has never bestowed any attention on them.","At last I went to the artisans, for I was conscious that I knew nothing at all, as I may say, and I was sure that they knew many fine things; and in this I was not mistaken, for they did know many things of which I was ignorant, and in this they certainly were wiser than I was. But I observed that even the good artisans fell into the same error as the poets; because they were good workmen they thought that they also knew all sorts of high matters, and this defect in them overshadowed their wisdom","He who is the real tyrant, whatever men may think, is the real slave, and is obliged to practise the greatest adulation and servility, and to be the flatterer of the vilest of mankind. He has desires which he is utterly unable to satisfy, and has more wants than any one, and is truly poor, if you know how to inspect the whole soul of him: all his life long he is beset with fear and is full of convulsions and distractions, even as the State which he resembles: and surely the resemblance holds? Very true, he said. Moreover, as we were saying before, he grows worse from having power: he becomes and is of necessity more jealous, more faithless, more unjust, more friendless, more impious, than he was at first; he is the purveyor and cherisher of every sort of vice, and the consequence is that he is supremely miserable, and that he makes everybody else as miserable as himself. No man of any sense will dispute your words. Come","Caring about the happiness of others, we find our own.","Good actions can strengthen ourselves and inspire good actions to others.","There is a constant suspicion that headache and giddiness are to be ascribed to philosophy, and hence all practising or making trial of virtue in the higher sense is absolutely stopped; for a man is always fancying that he is being made ill, and is in constant anxiety about the state of his body.","To fear death is nothing other than to think oneself wise when one is not; for it is to think one knows what one does not know. No man knows whether death may not even turn out to be the greatest blessing for a human being; and yet people fear it as if they knew for certain that is is the greatest of evil.\\" (Socrates in The Apology)","All soul is immortal. For that which is always in movement is immortal; that which moves something else, and is moved by something else, in ceasing from movement ceases from living. So only that which moves itself, because it does not abandon itself, never stops moving. But it is also source and first principle of movement for the other things which move. Now a first principle is something which does not come into being. For all that comes into being must come into being from a first principle, but a first principle itself cannot come into being from anything at all; for if a first principle came into being from anything, it would not do so from a first principle. Since it is something that does not come into being, it must also be something which does not perish. For if a first principle is destroyed, neither will it ever come into being from anything itself nor will anything else come into being from it, given that all things must come into being from a first principle. It is in this way, then, that that which moves itself is a first principle of movement. It is not possible for this either to be destroyed or to come into being, or else the whole universe and the whole of that which comes to be might collapse together and come to a halt, and never again have a source from which things will be moved and come to be. And since that which is moved by itself has been shown to be immortal, it will incur no shame to say that this is the essence and the definition of the soul","Will not the good man, who says whatever he says with a view to the best, speak with a reference to some standard and not at random; just as all other artists, whether the painter, the builder, the shipwright, or any other look all of them to their own work, and do not select and apply at random what they apply, but strive to give a definite form to it?","For I am certain, O men of Athens, that if I had engaged in politics, I should have perished long ago and done no good either to you or to myself.","I would rather . . . that the whole world should be at odds with me, and oppose me, rather than that I myself should be at odds with myself, and contradict myself.","I see that you are indifferent about money, which is a characteristic rather of those who have inherited their fortunes than of those who have acquired them; the makers of fortunes have a second love of money as a creation of their own, resembling the affection of authors for their own poems, or of parents for their children, besides that natural love of it for the sake of use and profit which is common to them and all men. And hence they are very bad company, for they can talk about nothing but the praises of wealth.","It\u2019s not from money that excellence comes, but from excellence money and the other things, all of them, come to be good for human beings, whether in private or in public life.","\xab\u1f08\u03bd\u03ac\u03b3\u03ba\u03b7\u03c2 \u03b8\u03c5\u03b3\u03b1\u03c4\u03c1\u03cc\u03c2 \u03ba\u03cc\u03c1\u03b7\u03c2 \u039b\u03b1\u03c7\u03ad\u03c3\u03b5\u03c9\u03c2 \u03bb\u03cc\u03b3\u03bf\u03c2. \u03a8\u03c5\u03c7\u03b1\u1f76 \u1f10\u03c6\u03ae\u03bc\u03b5\u03c1\u03bf\u03b9, \u1f00\u03c1\u03c7\u1f74 \u1f02\u03bb\u03bb\u03b7\u03c2 \u03c0\u03b5\u03c1\u03b9\u03cc\u03b4\u03bf\u03c5 \u03b8\u03bd\u03b7\u03c4\u03bf\u1fe6 \u03b3\u03ad\u03bd\u03bf\u03c5\u03c2 \u03b8\u03b1\u03bd\u03b1\u03c4\u03b7\u03c6\u03cc\u03c1\u03bf\u03c5. \u039f\u1f50\u03c7 \u1f51\u03bc\u1fb6\u03c2 \u03b4\u03b1\u03af\u03bc\u03c9\u03bd \u03bb\u03ae\u03be\u03b5\u03c4\u03b1\u03b9, \u1f00\u03bb\u03bb\u2019 \u1f51\u03bc\u03b5\u1fd6\u03c2 \u03b4\u03b1\u03af\u03bc\u03bf\u03bd\u03b1 \u03b1\u1f31\u03c1\u03ae\u03c3\u03b5\u03c3\u03b8\u03b5. \u03a0\u03c1\u1ff6\u03c4\u03bf\u03c2 \u03b4\u2019 \u1f41 \u03bb\u03b1\u03c7\u03ce\u03bd \u03c0\u03c1\u1ff6\u03c4\u03bf\u03c2 \u03b1\u1f31\u03c1\u03b5\u03af\u03c3\u03b8\u03c9 \u03b2\u03af\u03bf\u03bd \u1fa7 \u03c3\u03c5\u03bd\u03ad\u03c3\u03c4\u03b1\u03b9 \u1f10\u03be \u1f00\u03bd\u03ac\u03b3\u03ba\u03b7\u03c2. \u1f08\u03c1\u03b5\u03c4\u1f74 \u03b4\u1f72 \u1f00\u03b4\u03ad\u03c3\u03c0\u03bf\u03c4\u03bf\u03bd, \u1f23\u03bd \u03c4\u03b9\u03bc\u1ff6\u03bd \u03ba\u03b1\u1f76 \u1f00\u03c4\u03b9\u03bc\u03ac\u03b6\u03c9\u03bd \u03c0\u03bb\u03ad\u03bf\u03bd \u03ba\u03b1\u1f76 \u1f12\u03bb\u03b1\u03c4\u03c4\u03bf\u03bd \u03b1\u1f50\u03c4\u1fc6\u03c2 \u1f13\u03ba\u03b1\u03c3\u03c4\u03bf\u03c2 \u1f13\u03be\u03b5\u03b9. \u0391\u1f30\u03c4\u03af\u03b1 \u1f11\u03bb\u03bf\u03bc\u03ad\u03bd\u03bf\u03c5. \u03b8\u03b5\u1f78\u03c2 \u1f00\u03bd\u03b1\u03af\u03c4\u03b9\u03bf\u03c2.\xbb","\u200c\u0622\u0646\u0686\u0647 \u0643\u0647 \u0633\u0628\u0628 \u0634\u0648\u062f \u0643\u0647 \u0646\u064a\u0633\u062a\u064a \u0635\u0648\u0631\u062a \u0647\u0633\u062a\u064a \u0628\u0647 \u062e\u0648\u062f \u06af\u064a\u0631\u062f \u0622\u0641\u0631\u064a\u0646\u0634 \u0648 \u062e\u0644\u0627\u0642\u064a\u062a \u0627\u0633\u062a. \u0627\u0632 \u0627\u064a\u0646 \u0631\u0648\u060c \u0647\u0645\u0647 \u0647\u0646\u0631 \u0647\u0627 \u0622\u0641\u0631\u064a\u062f\u0646 \u0627\u0633\u062a \u0648 \u0627\u0633\u062a\u0627\u062f\u0627\u0646 \u0648 \u0647\u0646\u0631 \u0645\u0646\u062f\u0627\u0646\u060c \u0647\u0645\u0647 \u062e\u0644\u0627\u0642 \u0648 \u0622\u0641\u0631\u064a\u0646\u0634 \u06af\u0631\u0646\u062f","Does not every man love that which he deems noble and just and good, and hate the opposite of them?people regard the same things, some as just and others as unjust,--about these they dispute; and so there arise wars and fightings among them.","\u0641\u0644\u064a\u0633 \u0639\u0633\u064a\u0631 \u0623\u064a\u0647\u0627 \u0627\u0644\u0627\u0635\u062f\u0642\u0627\u0621 \u0623\u0646 \u0646\u0641\u0631 \u0645\u0646 \u0648\u062c\u0647 \u0627\u0644\u0645\u0648\u062a, \u0648\u0644\u0643\u0646 \u0627\u0644\u0639\u0633\u0631 \u0643\u0644 \u0627\u0644\u0639\u0633\u0631 \u0641\u064a \u062a\u062c\u0646\u0628 \u0627\u0644\u0623\u062e\u0644\u0627\u0642 \u0627\u0644\u0641\u0627\u0633\u062f\u0629, \u0641\u0627\u0644\u0641\u0633\u0627\u062f \u0648\u0627\u0644\u0645\u0648\u062a \u064a\u0639\u062f\u0648\u0627\u0646 \u0641\u064a \u0623\u0639\u0642\u0627\u0628\u0646\u0627, \u0648\u0644\u0643\u0646 \u0627\u0644\u0641\u0633\u0627\u062f \u0623\u0633\u0631\u0639 \u0645\u0646 \u0627\u0644\u0645\u0648\u062a \u0639\u062f\u0648\u0627","no man should be angry at what is true.

And he who at every age, as boy and youth and in mature life, has come out of the trial victorious and pure, shall be appointed a ruler and guardian of the State; he shall be honoured in life and death, and shall receive sepulture and other memorials of honour, the greatest that we have to give.

Philosophysees that the worst feature of this imprisonment is that it is due to desires,so that the prisoner himself is contributing to his own incarceration mostof all. As I say, the lovers of learning know that philosophy gets hold oftheir soul when it is in that state, then gently encourages it and tries tofree it by showing them that investigation through the eyes is full of deceit,as is that through the ears and the other senses.","Love\u2019 is the name for our pursuit of wholeness,for our desire to be complete.","It is no good for rulers if the people they rule cherish ambitions for themselves or form strong bonds of friendship with one another.","a man who is good for anything ought not to calculate the chance of living or dying; he ought only to consider whether in doing anything he is doing right or wrong\u2014acting the part of a good man or of a bad.","Let him alone, he has a way of stopping anywhere and losing himself without any reason.

And why, sillybillies, do you knock under to one another? I say that if you want really to know what justice is, you should not only ask but answer, and you should not seek honour to yourself from the refutation of an opponent, but have your own answer; for there is many a one who can ask and cannot answer.

And in this respect only I believe myself to differ from men in general, and may perhaps claim to be wiser than they are:\u2014that whereas I know but little of the world below, I do not suppose that I know: but I do know that injustice and disobedience to a better, whether God or man, is evil and dishonorable, and I will never fear or avoid a possible good rather than a certain evil.","The tools that would teach men their own use would be beyond price.","If it is pure when it leaves the body and drags nothing bodily with it, as it had no willing association with the body in life, but avoided it and gathered itself together by itself and always practiced this, which is no other than practicing philosophy in the right way, in fact, training to die easily.

When he sees it troubled and unable to discern anything clearly, instead of laughing thoughtlessly, he will ask whether, coming from a brighter existence, its unaccustomed vision is obscured by the darkness, in which case he will think its condition enviable and its life a happy one; or whether, emerging from the depths of ignorance, it is dazzled by excess of light.","Behold, he said, the wisdom of Socrates; he refuses to teach himself, and goes about learning of others, to whom he never even says Thank you.","But whether the just have a better and happier life than the unjust is a further question which we also proposed to consider.","...for the interests of rulers require that their subjects should be poor in spirit, and that there should be no strong bond of friendship or society among them, which love, above all other motives, is likely to inspire, as our Athenian tyrants learned by experience; for...

Once a person has made all these calculations, he keeps his peace and minds his own business, like someone withdrawing from the prevailing wind into the shelter of a wall in a storm of dust or rain, and as he sees everyone else filling themselves full of lawlessness he is content if he himself can somehow live out life here untainted by injustice and impious actions, and leave it with fine hopes and in a spirit of kindness and good will.","[W]hen men have both done and suffered injustice and have had experience of both, not being able to avoid the one and obtain the other, they think that they had better agree among themselves to have neither; hence there arise laws and mutual covenants; and that which is ordained by law is termed by them lawful and just. This they affirm to be the origin and nature of justice;\u2014it is a mean or compromise,between the best of all, which is to do injustice and not be punished, and the worst of all, which is to suffer injustice without the power of retaliation; and justice, being at a middle point between the two, is tolerated not as a good, but as the lesser evil\u2026","when a man comes near to the realization that he will be making an end, fear and care enter him for things to which he gave no thought before.

For what lover would not choose rather to be seen by all mankind than by his beloved, either when abandoning his post or throwing away his arms? He would be ready to die a thousand deaths rather than endure this. Or who would desert his beloved or fail him in the hour of danger? The veriest coward would become an inspired hero, equal to the bravest, at such a time; Love would inspire him.","We may state the question thus:\u2014Imitation imitates the actions of men, whether voluntary or involuntary, on which, as they imagine, a good or bad result has ensued, and they rejoice or sorrow accordingly.

And","we should also consider the remoter analogy of the animals. Many birds and animals, especially the carnivorous, have only one mate, and the love and care of offspring which seems to be natural is inconsistent with the primitive theory of marriage. If we go back to an imaginary state in which men were almost animals and the companions of them, we have as much right to argue from what is animal to what is human as from the barbarous to the civilized man. The record of animal life on the globe is fragmentary,\u2014the connecting links are wanting and cannot be supplied; the record of social life is still more fragmentary and precarious. Even if we admit that our first ancestors had no such institution as marriage, still the stages by which men passed from outer barbarism to the comparative civilization of China, Assyria, and Greece, or even of the ancient Germans, are wholly unknown to us.

Never. The true lover of learning then must from his earliest youth, as far as in him lies, desire all truth? Assuredly. But then again, as we know by experience, he whose desires are strong in one direction will have them weaker in others; they will be like a stream which has been drawn off into another channel. True. He whose desires are drawn towards knowledge in every form will be absorbed in the pleasures of the soul, and will hardly feel bodily pleasure\u2014I mean, if he be a true philosopher and not a sham one. That is most certain. Such","We ask what is the origin of marriage, and we are told that like the right of property, after many wars and contests, it has gradually arisen out of the selfishness of barbarians.","This they affirm to be the origin and nature of justice;\u2014it is a mean or compromise, between the best of all, which is to do injustice and not be punished, and the worst of all, which is to suffer injustice without the power of retaliation; and justice, being at a middle point between the two, is tolerated not as a good, but as the lesser evil, and honoured by reason of the inability of men to do injustice.","So then, perhaps there would be more justice in the bigger and it would be easier to observe closely. If you want, first we\u2019ll investigate what justice is like in the cities. Then, we\u2019ll also go on to consider it in individuals, considering the likeness of the bigger in the idea24 of the littler?","And as they have nothing but their persons which they can call their own, suits and complaints will have no existence among them; they will be delivered from all those quarrels of which money or children or relations are the occasion. Of course they will. Neither","And the love, more especially, which is concerned with the good, and which is perfected in company with temperance and justice, whether among gods or men, has the greatest power, and is the source of all our happiness and harmony, and makes us friends with the gods who are above us, and with one another.","Und nicht wahr, wenn man ihn zw\xe4nge, in das Licht selbst zu sehen, so w\xfcrde er Schmerzen an den Augen haben, davonlaufen und sich wieder jenen Schattengegenst\xe4nden zuwenden, die er ansehen kann, und w\xfcrde dabei bleiben, diese w\xe4ren wirklich deutlicher als die, welche er gezeigt bekam?And if he is compelled to look straight at the light, will he not have a pain in his eyes which will make him turn away to take and take in the objects of vision which he can see, and which he will conceive to be in reality clearer than the things which are now being shown to him?","Then God, if he be good, is not the author of all things, as the many assert, but he is the cause of a few things only, and not of most things that occur to men. For few are the goods of human life, and many are the evils, and the good is to be attributed to God alone; of the evils the causes are to be sought elsewhere, and not in him.","So I left him, saying to myself, as I went away: Well, although I do not suppose that either of us knows anything really beautiful and good, I am better off than he is,\u2014for he knows nothing, and thinks that he knows; I neither know nor think that I know.","First of all, in regard to slavery? Do you think it right that Hellenes should enslave Hellenic States, or allow others to enslave them, if they can help? Should not their custom be to spare them, considering the danger which there is that the whole race may one day fall under the yoke of the barbarians? To spare them is infinitely better. Then no Hellene should be owned by them as a slave; that is a rule which they will observe and advise the other Hellenes to observe. Certainly, he said; they will in this way be united against the barbarians and will keep their hands off one another. Next","Next as to the slain; ought the conquerors, I said, to take anything but their armour? Does not the practice of despoiling an enemy afford an excuse for not facing the battle? Cowards skulk about the dead, pretending that they are fulfilling a duty, and many an army before now has been lost from this love of plunder. Very true. And is there not illiberality and avarice in robbing a corpse, and also a degree of meanness and womanishness in making an enemy of the dead body when the real enemy has flown away and left only his fighting gear behind him,\u2014is not this rather like a dog who cannot get at his assailant, quarrelling with the stones which strike him instead? Very like a dog, he said. Then we must abstain from spoiling the dead or hindering their burial? Yes, he replied, we most certainly must. Neither","For, it could be doubted that the things said are possible; and, even if, in the best possible conditions, they could come into being, that they would be what is best will also be doubted. So that is why there\u2019s a certain hestitation about getting involved in it, for fear that the argument might seem to be a prayer, my dear comrade.","But it is not possible, Theodorus, that evil should be destroyed--for there must always be something opposed to the good; nor is it possible that it should have its seat in heaven. But it must inevitably haunt human life, and prowl about this earth. That is why a man should make all haste to escape from earth to heaven; and escape means becoming as like God as possible; and a man becomes like God when he becomes just and pious, with understanding.","When I began to talk with him, I could not help thinking that he was not really wise, although he was thought wise by many, and wiser still by himself; and I went and tried to explain to him that he thought himself wise, but was not really wise; and the consequence was that he hated me, and his enmity was shared by several who were present and heard me. So I left him, saying to myself, as I went away: Well, although I do not suppose that either of us knows anything really beautiful and good, I am better off than he is - for he knows nothing, and thinks that he knows. I neither know nor think that I know.","the true creator is necessity, who is the mother of our invention.","Justice is useful when money is useless.","The poet is a light and winged and holy thing, and there is no invention in him until he has been inspired and is out of his sneses, and the mind is no longer in him.","they think that you bear old age more [e] easily not because of the way you live but because you\u2019re wealthy, for the wealthy, they say, have many consolations.","I can\'t refute you, Socrates,\\" Agathon said, \\"so I dare say you\'re right.\\"\\"No,\\" said Socrates, \\"it\'s the truth you can\'t refute, my dear Agathon. Socrates is a pushover.","Both the community of property and the community of families, as I am saying, tend to make them more truly guardians; they will not tear the city in pieces by differing about \'mine\' and \'not mine;\' each man dragging any acquisition which he has made into a separate house of his own, where he has a separate wife and children and private pleasures and pains; but all will be affected as far as may be by the same pleasures and pains because they are all of one opinion about what is near and dear to them, and therefore they all tend towards a common end. Certainly, he replied. And as they have nothing but their persons which they can call their own, suits and complaints will have no existence among them; they will be delivered from all those quarrels of which money or children or relations are the occasion. Of course they will. Neither","There is nothing which for my part I like better, Cephalus, than conversing with aged men; for I regard them as travellers who have gone a journey which I too may have to go, and of whom I ought to inquire, whether the way is smooth and easy, or rugged and difficult.","At first, in the early days of his power, he is full of smiles, and he salutes every one whom he meets;\u2014he to be called a tyrant, who is making promises in public and also in private! liberating debtors, and distributing land to the people and his followers, and wanting to be so kind and good to every one! Of course, he said. But when he has disposed of foreign enemies by conquest or treaty, and there is nothing to fear from them, then he is always stirring up some war or other, in order that the people may require a leader. To be sure. Has he not also another object, which is that they may be impoverished by payment of taxes, and thus compelled to devote themselves to their daily wants and therefore less likely to conspire against him? Clearly. And if any of them are suspected by him of having notions of freedom, and of resistance to his authority, he will have a good pretext for destroying them by placing them at the mercy of the enemy; and for all these reasons the tyrant must be always getting up a war. He","And therefore he must look about him and see who is valiant, who is high-minded, who is wise, who is wealthy; happy man, he is the enemy of them all, and must seek occasion against them whether he will or no, until he has made a purgation of the State. Yes, he said, and a rare purgation. Yes, I said, not the sort of purgation which the physicians make of the body; for they take away the worse and leave the better part, but he does the reverse. If","isn\u2019t this why the rearing in music is most sovereign? Because rhythm and harmony most of all insinuate themselves into the inmost part of the soul and most vigorously lay hold of it in bringing grace with them; and they make a man graceful if he is correctly reared, if not, the opposite.","Please do not be offended if I tell you the truth.

A statement was made that injustice is stronger and more powerful than justice, but now justice, having been identified with wisdom and virtue, is easily shown to be stronger than injustice, if injustice is ignorance; this can no longer be questioned by any one. But I want to view the matter, Thrasymachus, in a different way: You would not deny that a state may be unjust and may be unjustly attempting to enslave other states, or may have already enslaved them, and may be holding many of them in subjection? True,","Two virtues remain to be discovered in the State\u2014first, temperance, and then justice which is the end of our search. Very true. Now, can we find justice without troubling ourselves about temperance? I do not know how that can be accomplished, he said, nor do I desire that justice should be brought to light and temperance lost sight of; and therefore I wish that you would do me the favour of considering temperance first. Certainly,","How well I remember the aged poet Sophocles, when in answer to the question, How does love suit with age, Sophocles,\u2014are you still the man you were? Peace, he replied; most gladly have I escaped the thing of which you speak; I feel as if I had escaped from a mad and furious master.","Yet is not the power which injustice exercises of such a nature that wherever she takes up her abode, whether in a city, in an army, in a family, or in any other body, that body is, to begin with, rendered incapable of united action by reason of sedition and distraction; and does it not become its own enemy and at variance with all that opposes it, and with the just? Is not this the case? Yes,","Temperance, I replied, is the ordering or controlling of certain pleasures and desires; this is curiously enough implied in the saying of \'a man being his own master;\' and other traces of the same notion may be found in language. No","The greatest of all logical truths, and the one of which writers on philosophy are most apt to lose sight, the difference between words and things, has been most strenuously insisted on by him (cp. Rep.; Polit.; Cratyl), although he has not always avoided the confusion of them in his own writings (e.g. Rep.).","It is easy to forgive children who are afraid of the dark but the real tragedy of life is men who are afraid of the light.","The meaning is, I believe, that in the human soul there is a better and also a worse principle; and when the better has the worse under control, then a man is said to be master of himself; and this is a term of praise: but when, owing to evil education or association, the better principle, which is also the smaller, is overwhelmed by the greater mass of the worse\u2014in this case he is blamed and is called the slave of self and unprincipled. Yes,","Tell me, Socrates, have you got a nurse? Why do you ask such a question, I said, when you ought rather to be answering?

I replied.","Are not all things which have opposites generated out of their opposites? I","Still I have a favor to ask of them. When my sons are grown up, I would ask you, O my friends, to punish them; and I would have you trouble them, as I have troubled you, if they seem to care about riches, or anything, more than about virtue; or if they pretend to be something when they are really nothing, - then reprove them, as I have reproved you, for not caring about that for which they ought to care, and thinking that they are something when they are really nothing. And if you do this, I and my sons will have received justice at your hands.","For certainly old age has a great sense of calm and freedom; when the passions relax their hold, then, as Sophocles says, we are freed from the grasp not of one mad master only, but of many. The truth is, Socrates, that these regrets, and also the complaints about relations, are to be attributed to the same cause, which is not old age, but men\'s characters and tempers; for he who is of a calm and happy nature will hardly feel the pressure of age, but to him who is of an opposite disposition youth and age are equally a burden. I","In my opinion it\'s preferable for me to be a musician with an out-of-tune lyre or a choir-leader with a cacophonous choir, and it\'s preferable for almost everyone in the world to find my beliefs misguided and wrong, rather than for just one person - me - to contradict and clash with myself.","Yes, if he is to have true music in him.","are you not ashamed of your eagerness to possess as much wealth, reputation, and honors as possible, while you do not care for nor give thought to wisdom or truth, or the best possible state of your soul?","I say that it is the greatest good for a man to discuss virtue every day and those other things about which you hear me conversing and testing myself and others, for the unexamined life is not worth living","This then is injustice; and on the other hand when the trader, the auxiliary, and the guardian each do their own business, that is justice, and will make the city just.

But nobody else should meddle with anything of the kind; and although the rulers have this privilege, for a private man to lie to them in return is to be deemed a more heinous fault than for the patient or the pupil of a gymnasium not to speak the truth about his own bodily illnesses to the physician or to the trainer, or for a sailor not to tell the captain what is happening about the ship and the rest of the crew, and how things are going with himself or his fellow sailors. Most","Education, I said, and nurture: If our citizens are well educated, and grow into sensible men, they will easily see their way through all these, as well as other matters which I omit; such, for example, as marriage, the possession of women and the procreation of children, which will all follow the general principle that friends have all things in common, as the proverb says. That","There can be no doubt that the love of wealth and the spirit of moderation cannot exist together in citizens of the same state to any considerable extent; one or the other will be disregarded.","Then we may begin by assuming that there are three classes of men\u2014lovers of wisdom, lovers of honour, lovers of gain? Exactly. And there are three kinds of pleasure, which are their several objects? Very true. Now, if you examine the three classes of men, and ask of them in turn which of their lives is pleasantest, each will be found praising his own and depreciating that of others: the money-maker will contrast the vanity of honour or of learning if they bring no money with the solid advantages of gold and silver? True, he said. And the lover of honour\u2014what will be his opinion? Will he not think that the pleasure of riches is vulgar, while the pleasure of learning, if it brings no distinction, is all smoke and nonsense to him? Very true. And are we to suppose, I said, that the philosopher sets any value on other pleasures in comparison with the pleasure of knowing the truth, and in that pursuit abiding, ever learning, not so far indeed from the heaven of pleasure? Does he not call the other pleasures necessary, under the idea that if there were no necessity for them, he would rather not have them?

Land animals came from men who had no use for philosophy and paid no heed to the heavens because they had lost the use of the circuits in the head and followed the guidance of those parts of the soul that are in the breast. By reason of these practices they let their forelimbs and heads be drawn down to the earth by natural affinity and there supported, and their heads were lengthened out and took any sort of shape into which their circles were crushed together through inactivity. On this account their kind was born with four feet or many, heaven giving to the more witless the greater number of points to support, that they might be all the more drawn earthward. The most senseless, whose whole bodies were stretched at length upon the earth, since they had no further need of feet, the gods made footless, crawling over the ground. The fourth sort, that live in water, came from the most foolish and stupid of all. The gods who remolded their form thought these unworthy any more to breathe the pure air, because their souls were polluted with every sort of transgression; and, in place of breathing the fine and clean air, they thrust them down to inhale the muddy water of the depths. Hence, came fishes and shellfish and all that lives in the water: in penalty for the last extreme of folly they are assigned the last and lowest habitation. These are the principles on which, now, as then all creatures change one into another, shifting their place with the loss or gain of understanding or folly.","The ruler who is good for anything ought not to beg his subjects to be ruled by him, although the present governors of mankind are of a different stamp.","And now, I said, let me show in a figure how far our nature is enlightened or unenlightened: --Behold! human beings living in a underground den, which has a mouth open towards the light and reaching all along the den; here they have been from their childhood, and have their legs and necks chained so that they cannot move, and can only see before them, being prevented by the chains from turning round their heads. Above and behind them a fire is blazing at a distance, and between the fire and the prisoners there is a raised way; and you will see, if you look, a low wall built along the way, like the screen which marionette players have in front of them, over which they show the puppets. Like ourselves, I replied; and they see only their own shadows, or the shadows of one another, which the fire throws on the opposite wall of the cave.","No one has ever adequately described either in verse or prose the true essential nature of either of them abiding in the soul, and invisible to any human or divine eye; or shown that of all the things of a man\'s soul which he has within him, justice is the greatest good, and injustice the greatest evil. Had this been the universal strain, had you sought to persuade us of this from our youth upwards, we should not have been on the watch to keep one another from doing wrong, but every one would have been his own watchman, because afraid, if he did wrong, of harbouring in himself the greatest of evils.","No question, he replied. To them, I said, the truth would be literally nothing but the shadows of the images. That is certain. And now look again, and see what will naturally follow if the prisoners are released and disabused of their error. At first, when any of them is liberated and compelled suddenly to stand up and turn his neck round and walk and look towards the light, he will suffer sharp pains; the glare will distress him, and he will be unable to see the realities of which in his former state he had seen the shadows; and then conceive some one saying to him, that what he saw before was an illusion, but that now, when he is approaching nearer to being and his eye is turned towards more real existence, he has a clearer vision,\u2014what will be his reply? And you may further imagine that his instructor is pointing to the objects as they pass and requiring him to name them,\u2014will he not be perplexed? Will he not fancy that the shadows which he formerly saw are truer than the objects which are now shown to him? Far truer. And","Then you will make a law that they shall have such an education as will enable them to attain the greatest skill in asking and answering questions?

But to whom we","Imagine then a fleet or a ship in which there is a captain who is taller and stronger than any of the crew, but he is a little deaf and has a similar infirmity in sight, and his knowledge of navigation is not much better. The sailors are quarrelling with one another about the steering --every one is of opinion that he has a right to steer, though he has never learned the art of navigation and cannot tell who taught him or when he learned, and will further assert that it cannot be taught, and they are ready to cut in pieces any one who says the contrary. They throng about the captain, begging and praying him to commit the helm to them; and if at any time they do not prevail, but others are preferred to them, they kill the others or throw them overboard, and having first chained up the noble captain\'s senses with drink or some narcotic drug, they mutiny and take possession of the ship and make free with the stores; thus, eating and drinking, they proceed on their voyage in such a manner as might be expected of them. Him who is their partisan and cleverly aids them in their plot for getting the ship out of the captain\'s hands into their own whether by force or persuasion, they compliment with the name of sailor, pilot, able seaman, and abuse the other sort of man, whom they call a good-for-nothing; but that the true pilot must pay attention to the year and seasons and sky and stars and winds, and whatever else belongs to his art, if he intends to be really qualified for the command of a ship, and that he must and will be the steerer, whether other people like or not-the possibility of this union of authority with the steerer\'s art has never seriously entered into their thoughts or been made part of their calling. Now in vessels which are in a state of mutiny and by sailors who are mutineers, how will the true pilot be regarded? Will he not be called by them a prater, a star-gazer, a good-for-nothing?","Let others praise justice and censure injustice, magnifying the rewards and honours of the one and abusing the other; that is a manner of arguing which, coming from them, I am ready to tolerate, but from you who have spent your whole life in the consideration of this question, unless I hear the contrary from your own lips, I expect something better. And therefore, I say, not only prove to us that justice is better than injustice, but show what they either of them do to the possessor of them, which makes the one to be a good and the other an evil, whether seen or unseen by gods and men. I","The accumulation of gold in the treasury of private individuals is the ruin of timocracy; they invent illegal modes of expenditure; for what do they or their wives care about the law? Yes, indeed. And then one, seeing another grow rich, seeks to rival him, and thus the great mass of the citizens become lovers of money. Likely enough. And so they grow richer and richer, and the more they think of making a fortune the less they think of virtue; for when riches and virtue are placed together in the scales of the balance, the one always rises as the other falls. True. And in proportion as riches and rich men are honoured in the State, virtue and the virtuous are dishonoured. Clearly. And what is honoured is cultivated, and that which has no honour is neglected.","Because a freeman ought not to be a slave in the acquisition of knowledge of any kind. Bodily exercise, when compulsory, does no harm to the body; but knowledge which is acquired under compulsion obtains no hold on the mind. Very true. Then,","I will tell you, I replied; justice, which is the subject of our enquiry, is, as you know, sometimes spoken of as the virtue of an individual, and sometimes as the virtue of a State. True, he replied. And is not a State larger than an individual? It is. Then in the larger the quantity of justice is likely to be larger and more easily discernible. I propose therefore that we enquire into the nature of justice and injustice, first as they appear in the State, and secondly in the individual, proceeding from the greater to the lesser and comparing them. That,","I have expressed\u2014whether rightly or wrongly God knows. But, whether true or false, my opinion is that in the world of knowledge the idea of good appears last of all, and is seen only with an effort; and, when seen, is also inferred to be the universal author of all things beautiful and right, parent of light and of the lord of light in this visible world, and the immediate source of reason and truth in the intellectual; and that this is the power upon which he who would act rationally either in public or private life must have his eye fixed. I agree, he said, as far as I am able to understand you. Moreover,","But when I hear other kinds of discussion, especially the talk of rich businessmen like you, I get bored and feel sorry for you and your friends, because you think you\'re doing something important, when your\'re not.

But I don\'t THINK you\'re a failure, I KNOW you are.","But when a man begins to get older, he will no longer be guilty of such insanity; he will imitate the dialectician who is seeking for truth, and not the eristic, who is contradicting for the sake of amusement; and the greater moderation of his character will increase instead of diminishing the honour of the pursuit. Very true, he said. And","There can be no doubt that the love of wealth and the spirit of moderation cannot exist together in citizens of the same state to any considerable extent; one or the other will be disregarded. That is tolerably clear. And","He is divine -- but then I call all philosophers that.","They say that to do injustice is, by nature, good; to suffer injustice, evil; but that the evil is greater than the good. And so when men have both done and suffered injustice and have had experience of both, not being able to avoid the one and obtain the other, they think that they had better agree among themselves to have neither; hence there arise laws and mutual covenants; and that which is ordained by law is termed by them lawful and just. This they affirm to be the origin and nature of justice;\u2014it is a mean or compromise, between the best of all, which is to do injustice and not be punished, and the worst of all, which is to suffer injustice without the power of retaliation; and justice, being at a middle point between the two, is tolerated not as a good, but as the lesser evil, and honoured by reason of the inability of men to do injustice. For no man who is worthy to be called a man would ever submit to such an agreement if he were able to resist; he would be mad if he did. Such is the received account, Socrates, of the nature and origin of justice. Now","One which is the next best, and has the advantage of compelling the citizens to look to their characters:\u2014Let there be a general rule that every one shall enter into voluntary contracts at his own risk, and there will be less of this scandalous money-making, and the evils of which we were speaking will be greatly lessened in the State. Yes, they will be greatly lessened. At present the governors, induced by the motives which I have named, treat their subjects badly; while they and their adherents, especially the young men of the governing class, are habituated to lead a life of luxury and idleness both of body and mind; they do nothing, and are incapable of resisting either pleasure or pain. Very true. They themselves care only for making money, and are as indifferent as the pauper to the cultivation of virtue. Yes,","But a further question arises: Is passion different from reason also, or only a kind of reason; in which latter case, instead of three principles in the soul, there will only be two, the rational and the concupiscent; or rather, as the State was composed of three classes, traders, auxiliaries, counsellors, so may there not be in the individual soul a third element which is passion or spirit, and when not corrupted by bad education is the natural auxiliary of reason? Yes, he said, there must be a third. Yes, I replied, if passion, which has already been shown to be different from desire, turn out also to be different from reason. But that is easily proved:\u2014We may observe even in young children that they are full of spirit almost as soon as they are born, whereas some of them never seem to attain to the use of reason, and most of them late enough. Excellent,","Everything that deceives also enchants.","Un buen consejo viene de la ciencia y no de las riquezas.","And he is to be deemed courageous whose spirit retains in pleasure and in pain the commands of reason about what he ought or ought not to fear? Right, he replied. And him we call wise who has in him that little part which rules, and which proclaims these commands; that part too being supposed to have a knowledge of what is for the interest of each of the three parts and of the whole? Assuredly. And would you not say that he is temperate who has these same elements in friendly harmony, in whom the one ruling principle of reason, and the two subject ones of spirit and desire are equally agreed that reason ought to rule, and do not rebel? Certainly, he said, that is the true account of temperance whether in the State or individual. And","Thinking is the talking of the soul with itself.","Socrates : Then would he not be conceding that his own opinion is false, if he grants that the opinion of those who think he is in error is true?Theodorus : Necessarily.Socrates : But the others do not concede that they are in error, do they?Theodorus : No, they do not.Socrates : And he, in turn, according to his writings, grants that this opinion also is true.Theodorus : Evidently.Socrates : Then all men, beginning with Protagoras, will dispute\u2014or rather, he will grant, after he once concedes that the opinion of the man who holds the opposite view is true\u2014even Protagoras himself, I say, will concede that neither a dog nor any casual man is a measure of anything whatsoever that he has not learned. Is not that the case?Theodorus : Yes.Socrates : Then since the \u201ctruth of Protagoras is disputed by all, it would be true to nobody, neither to anyone else nor to him.[171b-c]\u201d","Socrates sat up on the bed, bent his leg and rubbed it with his hand,and as he rubbed he said: \\"What a strange thing that which men callpleasure seems to be, and how astonishing the relation it has with whatis thought to be its opposite, namely pain! A man cannot have both at thesame time. Yet if he pursues and catches the one, he is almost alwaysbound to catch the other also, like two creatures with one head. I thinkc that if Aesop had noted this he would have composed a fable that a godwished to reconcile their opposition but could not do so, so he joined theirtwo heads together, and therefore when a man has the one, the otherfollows later. This seems to be happening to me. My bonds caused painin my leg, and now pleasure seems to be following.","Now the shepherds met together, according to custom, that they might send their monthly report about the flocks to the king; into their assembly he came having the ring on his finger, and as he was sitting among them he chanced to turn the collet of the ring inside his hand, when instantly he became invisible to the rest of the company and they began to speak of him as if he were no longer present. He was astonished at this, and again touching the ring he turned the collet outwards and reappeared; he made several trials of the ring, and always with the same result\u2014when he turned the collet inwards he became invisible, when outwards he reappeared. Whereupon he contrived to be chosen one of the messengers who were sent to the court; whereas soon as he arrived he seduced the queen, and with her help conspired against the king and slew him, and took the kingdom. Suppose now that there were two such magic rings,","In the first place, he is thought just, and therefore bears rule in the city; he can marry whom he will, and give in marriage to whom he will; also he can trade and deal where he likes, and always to his own advantage, because he has no misgivings about injustice; and at every contest, whether in public or private, he gets the better of his antagonists, and gains at their expense, and is rich, and out of his gains he can benefit his friends, and harm his enemies; moreover, he can offer sacrifices, and dedicate gifts to the gods abundantly and magnificently, and can honour the gods or any man whom he wants to honour in a far better style than the just, and therefore he is likely to be dearer than they are to the gods. And thus, Socrates, gods and men are said to unite in making the life of the unjust better than the life of the just. I","It isn\'t,\\" I said. \\"However, it is a fact that whether one falls into a little swimming pool or into the middle of the biggest sea, one nevertheless swims all the time.\\"\\"Most certainly.\\"\\"Then we too must swim and try to save ourselves from the argument, hoping that some dolphin might take us on his back or for some other unusual rescue.","Sinceramente? \xc8pico.","For once touched by love, everyone becomes a poet","And may we not say confidently of man also, that he who is likely to be gentle to his friends and acquaintances, must by nature be a lover of wisdom and knowledge? That we may safely affirm. Then he who is to be a really good and noble guardian of the State will require to unite in himself philosophy and spirit and swiftness and strength? Undoubtedly. Then we have found the desired natures; and now that we have found them, how are they to be reared and educated?","Some say there are nine Muses. Count again. Behold the tenth: Sappho of Lesbos.","To these statements, Socrates, no one can offer a reply; but when you talk in this way, a strange feeling passes over the minds of your hearers: They fancy that they are led astray a little at each step in the argument, owing to their own want of skill in asking and answering questions; these littles accumulate, and at the end of the discussion they are found to have sustained a mighty overthrow and all their former notions appear to be turned upside down. And as unskilful players of draughts are at last shut up by their more skilful adversaries and have no piece to move, so they too find themselves shut up at last; for they have nothing to say in this new game of which words are the counters; and yet all the time they are in the right. The observation is suggested to me by what is now occurring. For any one of us might say, that although in words he is not able to meet you at each step of the argument, he sees as a fact that the votaries of philosophy, when they carry on the study, not only in youth as a part of education, but as the pursuit of their maturer years, most of them become strange monsters, not to say utter rogues, and that those who may be considered the best of them are made useless to the world by the very study which you extol.","You know also that the beginning is the most important part of any work, especially in the case of a young and tender thing; for that is the time at which the character is being formed and the desired impression is more readily taken. Quite true. And shall we just carelessly allow children to hear any casual tales which may be devised by casual persons, and to receive into their minds ideas for the most part the very opposite of those which we should wish them to have when they are grown up? We cannot. Then the first thing will be to establish a censorship of the writers of fiction, and let the censors receive any tale of fiction which is good, and reject the bad; and we will desire mothers and nurses to tell their children the authorised ones only.","When [a man] thinks that he is reasoning he is really disputing, just because he cannot define and divide, and so know that of which he is speaking; and he will pursue a merely verbal opposition in the spirit of contention and not of fair discussion.","For a young person cannot judge what is allegorical and what is literal; anything that he receives into his mind at that age is likely to become indelible and unalterable; and therefore it is most important that the tales which the young first hear should be models of virtuous thoughts. There you are right, he replied; but if any one asks where are such models to be found and of what tales are you speaking\u2014how shall we answer him? I said to him, You and I, Adeimantus, at this moment are not poets, but founders of a State: now the founders of a State ought to know the general forms in which poets should cast their tales, and the limits which must be observed by them, but to make the tales is not their business. Very","Philosophy begins in wonder.\\" -Plato","The first of the two loves has a noble purpose, and delights only in the intelligent nature of man, and is faithful to the end, and has no shadow of wantonness or lust. The second is the coarser kind of love, which is a love of the body rather than of the soul, and is of women and boys as well as of men.","The vulgar love of the body which takes wing and flies away when the bloom of youth is over, is disgraceful, and so is the interested love of power or wealth; but the love of the noble mind is lasting.","Then God, if he be good, is not the author of all things, as the many assert, but he is the cause of a few things only, and not of most things that occur to men. For few are the goods of human life, and many are the evils, and the good is to be attributed to God alone; of the evils the causes are to be sought elsewhere, and not in him. That","There is another aspect of the marriage question to which Plato is a stranger. All the children born in his state are foundlings. It never occurred to him that the greater part of them, according to universal experience, would have perished. For children can only be brought up in families. There is a subtle sympathy between the mother and the child which cannot be supplied by other mothers, or by \'strong nurses one or more\' (Laws). If Plato\'s \'pen\' was as fatal as the Creches of Paris, or the foundling hospital of Dublin, more than nine-tenths of his children would have perished. There would have been no need to expose or put out of the way the weaklier children, for they would have died of themselves.","Nay, Socrates,\\" said Glaucon, \\"the measure of listening to such discussions is the whole of life for reasonable men\\".

Rather of all these things, the most sacred is the good human being, while the most polluted is the wicked.\\"Speech attributed to Socrates in Plato, Minos 319a, trans. Thomas L. Pangle, in The Roots of Political Philosophy: Ten Forgotten Socratic Dialogues, ed. Thomas L. Pangle (Ithaca: Cornell University Press, 1987), 63.","The punishment we suffer, if we refuse to take an interest in matters of government, is to live under thegovernment of worse men.","Still, while condemning Plato, we must acknowledge that neither Christianity, nor any other form of religion and society, has hitherto been able to cope with this most difficult of social problems, and that the side from which Plato regarded it is that from which we turn away. Population is the most untameable force in the political and social world.","For the fact is thatneither the grammarian nor any other person of skill ever makes a mistakein so far as he is what his name implies; they none of them err unlesstheir skill fails them, and then they cease to be skilled artists. Noartist or sage or ruler errs at the time when he is what his name implies;though he is commonly said to err.","Then what about the actual acquiring of knowledge? Is the body anobstacle when one associates with it in the search for knowledge? I mean,for example, do men find any truth in sight or hearing, or are not eventhe poets forever telling us that we do not see or hear anything accurately,and surely if those two physical senses are not clear or precise, our othersenses can hardly be accurate, as they are all inferior to these.

And God proclaims as a first principle to the rulers, and above all else, that there is nothing which they should so anxiously guard, or of which they are to be such good guardians, as of the purity of the race. They should observe what elements mingle in their offspring; for if the son of a golden or silver parent has an admixture of brass and iron, then nature orders a transposition of ranks, and the eye of the ruler must not be pitiful towards the child because he has to descend in the scale and become a husbandman or artisan, just as there may be sons of artisans who having an admixture of gold or silver in them are raised to honour, and become guardians or auxiliaries. For an oracle says that when a man of brass or iron guards the State, it will be destroyed. Such is the tale; is there any possibility of making our citizens believe in it? Not in the present generation, he replied; there is no way of accomplishing this; but their sons may be made to believe in the tale, and their sons\' sons, and posterity after them.

But when a man besides taking away the money of the citizens has made slaves of them, then, instead of these names of reproach, he is termed happy and blessed, not only by the citizens but by all who hear of his having achieved the consummation of injustice. For mankind censure injustice, fearing that they may be the victims of it and not because they shrink from committing it. And thus, as I have shown, Socrates, injustice, when on a sufficient scale, has more strength and freedom and mastery than justice; and, as I said at first, justice is the interest of the stronger, whereas injustice is a man\'s own profit and interest.","\u0643\u062b\u064a\u0631\u0648\u0646 \u0647\u0645 \u0645\u0646 \u064a\u062d\u0645\u0644\u0648\u0646 \u0639\u0635\u0627 \u0627\u0644\u0633\u062d\u0631, \u0623\u0645\u0627 \u0627\u0644\u0639\u0627\u0644\u0645\u0648\u0646 \u0628\u0627\u0644\u0633\u062d\u0631 \u0641\u0642\u0644\u064a\u0644","I am one of those who are very willing to be refuted if I say anything which is not true, and very willing to refute anyone else who says what is not true, and quite as ready to be refuted as to refute; for I hold that this is the greater gain of the two, just as the gain is greater of being cured of a very great evil than of curing another.","\u0648\u0627\u0646\u062a \u0625\u0630\u0627 \u0631\u0623\u064a\u062a \u0631\u062c\u0644\u0627 \u064a\u062c\u0632\u0639 \u0645\u0646 \u0627\u0642\u062a\u0631\u0627\u0628 \u0627\u0644\u0645\u0648\u062a, \u0643\u0627\u0646 \u062c\u0632\u0639\u0647 \u062f\u0644\u064a\u0644\u0627 \u0642\u0627\u0637\u0639\u0627 \u0639\u0644\u064a \u0627\u0646\u0647 \u0644\u064a\u0633 \u0645\u062d\u0628\u0627 \u0644\u0644\u062d\u0643\u0645\u0629, \u0648\u0644\u0643\u0646\u0647 \u0645\u062d\u0628 \u0644\u0644\u062c\u0633\u062f, \u0648\u0631\u0628\u0645\u0627 \u0643\u0627\u0646 \u0641\u064a \u0627\u0644\u0648\u0642\u062a \u0646\u0641\u0633\u0647 \u0645\u062d\u0628\u0627 \u0644\u0644\u0645\u0627\u0644 \u0623\u0648 \u0627\u0644\u0642\u0648\u0629 \u0623\u0648 \u0643\u0644\u0627\u064a\u0647\u0645\u0627","Beauty is the splendour of truth","The very bad men come from the class of those who have power.

It is because they fear this, in my view, that decent men rule, when they do rule; and at that time they proceed to enter on rule, not as though they were going to something good, or as though they were going to be well off in it; but they enter on it as a necessity and because they have no one better than or like themselves to whom to turn it over.","And poets do really know the things about which they seem to the many to speak so well?","There are five of the State, and five of the soul, I said. What are they? The first, I said, is that which we have been describing, and which may be said to have two names, monarchy and aristocracy, accordingly as rule is exercised by one distinguished man or by many. True, he replied. But I regard the two names as describing one form only; for whether the government is in the hands of one or many, if the governors have been trained in the manner which we have supposed, the fundamental laws of the State will be maintained.","For men born and educated like our citizens, the only way, in my opinion, of arriving at a right conclusion about the possession and use of women and children is to follow the path on which we originally started, when we said that the men were to be the guardians and watchdogs of the herd. True.","I knew that not by wisdom do poets write poetry, but by a sort of genius and inspiration; they are like diviners or soothsayers who also say many fine things, but do not understand the meaning of them.","but a man of pleasure like yourself ought to know that all who are in the flower of youth do somehow or other raise a pang or emotion in a lover\'s breast, and are thought by him to be worthy of his affectionate regards. Is not this a way which you have with the fair: one has a snub nose, and you praise his charming face; the hook-nose of another has, you say, a royal look; while he who is neither snub nor hooked has the grace of regularity: the dark visage is manly, the fair are children of the gods; and as to the sweet \'honey pale,\' as they are called, what is the very name but the invention of a lover who talks in diminutives, and is not averse to paleness if appearing on the cheek of youth? In a word, there is no excuse which you will not make, and nothing which you will not say, in order not to lose a single flower that blooms in the spring-time of youth.

Need I waste time in speaking of the art of weaving, and the management of pancakes and preserves, in which womankind does really appear to be great, and in which for her to be beaten by a man is of all things the most absurd? You are quite right, he replied, in maintaining the general inferiority of the female sex: although many women are in many things superior to many men, yet on the whole what you say is true. And","This is an unusual picture that you are presenting here, and these are unusual prisoners.","Just the opposite. In childhood and youth their study, and what philosophy they learn, should be suited to their tender years: during this period while they are growing up towards manhood, the chief and special care should be given to their bodies that they may have them to use in the service of philosophy; as life advances and the intellect begins to mature, let them increase the gymnastics of the soul; but when the strength of our citizens fails and is past civil and military duties, then let them range at will and engage in no serious labour, as we intend them to live happily here, and to crown this life with a similar happiness in another.

That either or both of these alternatives are impossible, I see no reason to affirm: if they were so, we might indeed be justly ridiculed as dreamers and visionaries. Am I not right? Quite right.

They are two, and yet they grow together out of one head or stem; and I can not help thinking that if Aesop had noticed them, he would have made a fable about God trying to reconcile their strife, and when he could not, he fastened their heads together; and this is the reason why when one comes the other follows, as I find in my own case pleasure comes following after the pain in my leg which was caused by the chain.","Knowledge, do you say it is power? yes most mighty of all powers.","There can be no nobler training than that, he replied. And therefore, I said, Glaucon, musical training is a more potent instrument than any other, because rhythm and harmony find their way into the inward places of the soul, on which they mightily fasten, imparting grace, and making the soul of him who is rightly educated graceful, or of him who is ill-educated ungraceful; and also because he who has received this true education of the inner being will most shrewdly perceive omissions or faults in art and nature, and with a true taste, while he praises and rejoices over and receives into his soul the good, and becomes noble and good, he will justly blame and hate the bad, now in the days of his youth, even before he is able to know the reason why; and when reason comes he will recognise and salute the friend with whom his education has made him long familiar. Yes,","Surely you don\'t consider me so inflated with the theater as not even to know that for anyone in his right mind a sensible few are more terrifying than a foolish many.","If you think that by killing men you can prevent some one from censuring your evil lives, you are mistaken; that is not a way of escape which is either possible or honourable; the easiest and the noblest way is not to be disabling others, but to be improving yourselves.","Music is a moral law.

Now my belief is,\u2014and this is a matter upon which I should like to have your opinion in confirmation of my own, but my own belief is,\u2014not that the good body by any bodily excellence improves the soul, but, on the contrary, that the good soul, by her own excellence, improves the body as far as this may be possible. What do you say? Yes, I agree. Then,","And can there be anything better for the interests of the State than that the men and women of a State should be as good as possible?

Then we have made an enactment not only possible but in the highest degree beneficial to the State? True. Then let the wives of our guardians strip, for their virtue will be their robe, and let them share in the toils of war and the defence of their country; only in the distribution of labours the lighter are to be assigned to the women, who are the weaker natures, but in other respects their duties are to be the same. And as for the man who laughs at naked women exercising their bodies from the best of motives, in his laughter he is plucking \'A fruit of unripe wisdom,\' and he himself is ignorant of what he is laughing at, or what he is about;\u2014for that is, and ever will be, the best of sayings, That the useful is the noble and the hurtful is the base. Very","For ayoung person cannot judge what is allegorical and what is literal; anything thathe receives into his mind at that age is likely to become indelible and unaltera-ble; and therefore it is most important that the tales which the young first hearshould be models of virtuous thoughts.","The law, I said, which is the sequel of this and of all that has preceded, is to the following effect,\u2014\'that the wives of our guardians are to be common, and their children are to be common, and no parent is to know his own child, nor any child his parent.\' Yes, he said, that is a much greater wave than the other; and the possibility as well as the utility of such a law are far more questionable. I do not think, I said, that there can be any dispute about the very great utility of having wives and children in common; the possibility is quite another matter, and will be very much disputed. I","if someone got to see the Beautiful itself, absolute, pure, unmixed, not polluted by human flesh or colors or any other great nonsense of mortality, but if he could see the divine Beauty itself in its one form? Do you think it would be a poor life for a human being to look there and to behold it by that which he ought, and to be with it? Or haven\'t you remembered that in that life alone, when he looks at Beauty in the only way what Beauty can be seen - only then will it become possible for him to give birth no to images of virtue (because he\'s in touch with no images) but to true virtue (because he is in touch with the true Beauty). The love of the gods belongs to anyone who has given birth to true virtue and nourished it, and if any human being could become immortal, it would be he.","Then, when the rhetorician is more persuasive than the physician, the ignorant is more persuasive with the ignorant than he who has knowledge?\u2014is not that the inference?","They will begin by taking the State and the manners of men, from which, as from a tablet, they will rub out the picture, and leave a clean surface.

They will be very right, he said. Having effected this, they will proceed to trace an outline of the constitution? No doubt. And when they are filling in the work, as I conceive, they will often turn their eyes upwards and downwards: I mean that they will first look at absolute justice and beauty and temperance, and again at the human copy; and will mingle and temper the various elements of life into the image of a man; and this they will conceive according to that other image, which, when existing among men, Homer calls the form and likeness of God.

Already we have been compelled to attribute opposite determinations to Being.

I tell you that virtue is not given by money, but that from virtue comes money and every other good of man, public as well as private. This is my teaching, and if this is the doctrine which corrupts the youth, I am a mischievous person.","Like mythology, Greek philosophy has a tendency to personify ideas.

I","There is no need, however, to be angry at this ambition of theirs-- which may be forgiven; for every man ought to be loved who says and manfully pursues and works out anything which is at all like wisdom: at the same time we shall do well to see them as they really are.","The clearest argument against Plato\u2019s authorship is probably that Plato never wrote a work whose interpretation was as simple and straightforward as that of Alcibiades.","The difference between the two classes is often a trivial concern; but in a state, and when affecting really important matters, becomes of all disorders the most hateful.","Ali,srecnice moj,mozda sam ja nista,a ti to ne primecujes.","ought the just to injure any one at all?","The ordinary logic is also jealous of the explanation of negation as relation, because seeming to take away the principle of contradiction. Plato, as far as we know, is the first philosopher who distinctly enunciated this principle; and though we need not suppose him to have been always consistent with himself, there is no real inconsistency between his explanation of the negative and the principle of contradiction. Neither the Platonic notion of the negative as the principle of difference, nor the Hegelian identity of Being and Not-being, at all touch the principle of contradiction. For what is asserted about Being and Not-Being only relates to our most abstract notions, and in no way interferes with the principle of contradiction employed in the concrete. Because Not-being is identified with Other, or Being with Not-being, this does not make the proposition \'Some have not eaten\' any the less a contradiction of \'All have eaten.","That the makers of laws are the majority who are weak; and they make laws and distribute praises and censures with a view to themselves and to their own interests.","Handwriting is the shackle of the mind.","What else can one do in the time before sunset?","Then, in order that we may see clearly what we are doing, let us imagine democracy to be divided, as indeed it is, into three classes; for in the first place freedom creates rather more drones in the democratic than there were in the oligarchical State. That is true. And in the democracy they are certainly more intensified. How so? Because in the oligarchical State they are disqualified and driven from office, and therefore they cannot train or gather strength; whereas in a democracy they are almost the entire ruling power, and while the keener sort speak and act, the rest keep buzzing about the bema and do not suffer a word to be said on the other side; hence in democracies almost everything is managed by the drones. Very","To refer a subject to a negative class is unmeaning, unless the \'not\' is a mere modification of the positive, as in the example of \'not honourable\' and \'dishonourable\'; or unless the class is characterized by the absence rather than the presence of a particular quality.","We can easily forgive a child who is afraid of the dark; the real tragedy is when men are afraid of the light","And this is proved by the fact that when he obtains the power, he immediately becomes unjust as far as he can be.","Although I do not suppose that either of us knows anything really beautiful and good, I am better off than he is,--for he knows nothing, and thinks that he knows; I neither know nor think that I know.

He knew nothing, and knew that he knew nothing: they knew little or nothing, and imagined that they knew all things.","This much I ask from them: when my sons grow up, avenge yourselves by, causing them the same kind of grief that I caused you, if you think they care for money or anything else more than they care for virtue, or if they think they are somebody when they are nobody. Reproach them as I reproach you, that they do not care for the right things and think they are worthy when they are not worthy of anything.

Consider it this way: must it not be the case, in your opinion, that when we are about to do or say anything, we first suppose that we know, or do really know, the thing we so confidently intend to say or do?[144d]","The true lover of learning then must from his earliest youth, as far as in him lies, desire all truth...","question\u2014What is justice, stripped of appearances?","I am wiser than this man, for neither of us appears to know anything great and good; but he fancies he knows something, although he knows nothing; whereas I, as I do not know anything, so I do not fancy I do. In this trifling particular, then, I appear to be wiser than he, because I do not fancy I know what I do not know.","As the Pre- Socratic philosopher failed to distinguish between the universal and the true, while he placed the particulars of sense under the false and apparent, so Plato appears to identify negation with falsehood, or is unable to distinguish them. The greatest service rendered by him to mental science is the recognition of the communion of classes, which, although based by him on his account of \'Not-being,\' is independent of it.","Then a slice of our neighbours\u2019 land will be wanted by us for pasture and tillage,and they will want a slice of ours, if, like ourselves, they exceed the limit ofnecessity, and give themselves up to the unlimited accumulation of wealth?That, Socrates, will be inevitable.And so we shall go to war, Glaucon.

And this is the reason, my dear Thrasymachus, why, as I was just now saying, no one is willing to govern; because no one likes to take in hand the reformation of evils which are not his concern without remuneration. For, in the execution of his work, and in giving his orders to another, the true artist does not regard his own interest, but always that of his subjects; and therefore in order that rulers may be willing to rule, they must be paid in one of three modes of payment, money, or honour, or a penalty for refusing. What","For the philosopher is wholly unacquainted with his next-door neighbour; he is ignorant, not only of what he is doing, but he hardly knows whether he is a man or an animal; he is searching into the essence of man, and busy in enquiring what belongs to such a nature to do or suffer different from any other;\u2014I think that you understand me, Theodorus?","SOCRATES: Then let me raise another question; there is such a thing as \u2018having learned\u2019? GORGIAS: Yes. SOCRATES: And there is also \u2018having believed\u2019? GORGIAS: Yes. SOCRATES: And is the \u2018having learned\u2019 the same as \u2018having believed,\u2019 and are learning and belief the same things? GORGIAS: In my judgment, Socrates, they are not the same. SOCRATES: And your judgment is right, as you may ascertain in this way:\u2014 If a person were to say to you, \u2018Is there, Gorgias, a false belief as well as a true?\u2019\u2014you would reply, if I am not mistaken, that there is. GORGIAS: Yes. SOCRATES: Well, but is there a false knowledge as well as a true? GORGIAS: No. SOCRATES: No, indeed; and this again proves that knowledge and belief differ.","This image of eternity is what we have come to call \\"time\\", since along with the creation of the universe he devised and created days, nights, months, and years, which did not exist before the creation of the universe. They are all parts of time, and \'was\' and \'will be\' are created aspects of time which we thoughtlessly and mistakenly apply to that which is eternal. For we say that it was, is, and will be, when in fact only \'is\' truly belongs to it, while \'was\' and \'will be\' are properties of things that are created and that change over time, since \'was\' and \'will be\' are both changes.","Simonides, then, after the manner of poets, would seem to have spoken darkly of the nature of justice; for he really meant to say that justice is the giving to each man what is proper to him, and this he termed a debt. That","Now the worst part of the punishment is that he who refuses to rule is liable to be ruled by one who is worse than himself. And the fear of this, as I conceive, induces the good to take office, not because they would, but because they cannot help\u2014not under the idea that they are going to have any benefit or enjoyment themselves, but as a necessity, and because they are not able to commit the task of ruling to any one who is better than themselves, or indeed as good. For there is reason to think that if a city were composed entirely of good men, then to avoid office would be as much an object of contention as to obtain office is at present; then we should have plain proof that the true ruler is not meant by nature to regard his own interest, but that of his subjects; and every one who knew this would choose rather to receive a benefit from another than to have the trouble of conferring one. So far am I from agreeing with Thrasymachus that justice is the interest of the stronger.","Some people are born to get married, have children and live happily ever after, and others to became philosophers.","...[T]he right way is to give one\'s attention first to the highest good of the young, just as you expect a good gardener to give his attention first to the young plants, and after that to the others. - Socrates","Then the one which is not, if it is to maintain itself, must have the being of not-being as the bond of not-being, just as being must have as a bond the not-being of not-being in order to perfect its own being; for the truest assertion of the being of being and of the not-being of not-being is when being partakes of the being of being, and not of the being of not- being--that is, the perfection of being; and when not-being does not partake of the not-being of not-being but of the being of not-being--that is the perfection of not-being.","But when the cobbler or any other man whom nature designed to be a trader, having his heart lifted up by wealth or strength or the number of his followers, or any like advantage, attempts to force his way into the class of warriors, or a warrior into that of legislators and guardians, for which he is unfitted, and either to take the implements or the duties of the other; or when one man is trader, legislator, and warrior all in one, then I think you will agree with me in saying that this interchange and this meddling of one with another is the ruin of the State.

Yes, he said; there lies the difficulty. Then","For to fear death, gentlemen, is only to think you are wise when you are not; for it is to think you know what you don\u2019t know.

Surely this is the objectionable kind of ignorance, to think one knows what one does not know? But in this, gentlemen, here also perhaps I am different from the general run of mankind, and if I should claim to be wiser than someone in something it would be in this, that as I do not know well enough about what happens in the house of Hades, so I do not think I know; but to do wrong, and to disobey those who are better than myself, whether god or man, that I know to be bad and disgraceful.","The society we have described can never grow into a reality or see the light of day, and there will be no end to the troubles of states, or indeed, my dear Glaucon, of humanity itself, till philosophers become rulers in this world, or till those we now call kings and rulers really and truly become philosophers, and political power and philosophy thus come into the same hands. \u2015 Plato, Plato\'s Republic\u201d","What do you mean? he asked.

Now if you suppose that there is no consciousness, but a sleep like the sleep of him who is undisturbed even by dreams, death will be an unspeakable gain. For if a person were to select the night in which his sleep was undisturbed even by dreams, and were to compare with this the other days and nights of his life, and then were to tell us how many days and nights he had passed in the course of his life better and more pleasantly than this one, I think that any man, I will not say a private man, but even the great king will not find many such days or nights, when compared with the others. Now if death be of such a nature, I say that to die is gain; for eternity is then only a single night.

For in my simplicity I imagined that the topics of praise should be true, and that this being presupposed, out of the true the speaker was to choose the best and set them forth in the best manner. And I felt quite proud, thinking that I knew the nature of true praise, and should speak well. Whereas I now see that the intention was to attribute to Love every species of greatness and glory, whether really belonging to him or not, without regard to truth or falsehood\u2014that was no matter; for the original proposal seems to have been not that each of you should really praise Love, but only that you should appear to praise him. And so you attribute to Love every imaginable form of praise which can be gathered anywhere; and you say that \'he is all this,\' and \'the cause of all that,\' making him appear the fairest and best of all to those who know him not, for you cannot impose upon those who know him. And a noble and solemn hymn of praise have you rehearsed. But as I misunderstood the nature of the praise when I said that I would take my turn, I must beg to be absolved from the promise which I made in ignorance, and which (as Euripides would say (Eurip. Hyppolytus)) was a promise of the lips and not of the mind. Farewell then to such a strain: for I do not praise in that way; no, indeed, I cannot. But if you like to hear the truth about love, I am ready to speak in my own manner, though I will not make myself ridiculous by entering into any rivalry with you. Say then, Phaedrus, whether you would like to have the truth about love, spoken in any words and in any order which may happen to come into my mind at the time. Will that be agreeable to you?

He has desires which he is utterly unable to satisfy, and has more wants than any one, and is truly poor, if you know how to inspect the whole soul of him: all his life long he is beset with fear and is full of convulsions, and distractions, even as the State which he resembles: and surely the resemblance holds?","qui\xe9nes son entonces -pregunt\xf3- los que llamas fil\xf3sofos verdaderos? -Los que gustan de contemplar la verdad -respond\xed.","\xc2nito e Meleto podem matar-me,mas n\xe3o me podem fazer mal.\\"Plat\xe3o, Apologia de S\xf3crates (30 C-D)","he who would proceed in due course should love first one fair form, and then many, and learn the connexion of them; and from beautiful bodies he should proceed to beautiful minds, and the beauty of laws and institutions, until he perceives that all beauty is of one kindred; and from institutions he should go on to the sciences, until at last the vision is revealed to him of a single science of universal beauty, and then he will behold the everlasting nature which is the cause of all, and will be near the end. In the contemplation of that supreme being of love he will be purified of earthly leaven, and will behold beauty, not with the bodily eye, but with the eye of the mind, and will bring forth true creations of virtue and wisdom,","What being is there that does not desire happiness? Well then, since all of us desire happiness, how can we be happy? \u2013 that is the next question.","No reproach for a person willing to give honorable service in the passion to become wise.","Then the good and wise judge whom we are seeking is not this man, but the other; for vice cannot know virtue too, but a virtuous nature, educated by time, will acquire a knowledge both of virtue and vice: the virtuous, and not the vicious, man has wisdom\u2014in my opinion.","Wonder is the feeling of a philosopher, and all philosophy begins in wonder","I have seen men of reputation, when they have been condemned, behaving in the strangest manner: they seemed to fancy that they were going to suffer something dreadful if they died, and that they could be immortal if you only allowed them to live; and I think that such are a dishonour to the state, and that any stranger coming in would have said of them that the most eminent men of Athens, to whom the Athenians themselves give honour and command, are no better than women.","What do you consider tobe the greatest blessing which you have reaped from your wealth?One, he said, of which I could not expect easily to convince others. For let metell you, Socrates, that when a man thinks himself to be near death, fears andcares enter into his mind which he never had before; the tales of a world be-low and the punishment which is exacted there of deeds done here were oncea laughing matter to him, but now he is tormented with the thought that theymay be true: either from the weakness of age, or because he is now drawingnearer to that other place, he has a clearer view of these things; suspicions andalarms crowd thickly upon him, and he begins to reflect and consider whatwrongs he has done to others.

Can any other origin of a State be imagined? There can be no other. Then, as we have many wants, and many persons are needed to supply them, one takes a helper for one purpose and another for another; and when these partners and helpers are gathered together in one habitation the body of inhabitants is termed a State. True, he said. And they exchange with one another, and one gives, and another receives, under the idea that the exchange will be for their good. Very true. Then,","\xbfLas opiniones buenas no son las de los sabios, y las malas las de los necios?","those who have made their own money don\u2019t just care about it because {5} it\u2019s useful, as other people do, but because it\u2019s something they\u2019ve made themselves.","Now the first and greatest of necessities is food, which is the condition of life and existence.

And how long is this stage of their lives to last? Fifteen years, I answered; and when they have reached fifty years of age, then let those who still survive and have distinguished themselves in every action of their lives and in every branch of knowledge come at last to their consummation: the time has now arrived at which they must raise the eye of the soul to the universal light which lightens all things, and behold the absolute good; for that is the pattern according to which they are to order the State and the lives of individuals, and the remainder of their own lives also; making philosophy their chief pursuit, but, when their turn comes, toiling also at politics and ruling for the public good, not as though they were performing some heroic action, but simply as a matter of duty; and when they have brought up in each generation others like themselves and left them in their place to be governors of the State, then they will depart to the Islands of the Blest and dwell there; and the city will give them public memorials and sacrifices and honour them, if the Pythian oracle consent, as demigods, but if not, as in any case blessed and divine.

And therefore the mind of the philosopher alone has wings; and this is just, for he is always, according to the measure of his abilities, clinging in recollection to those things in which God abides, and in beholding which He is what He is.

Every circle, of those which are by the act of man drawn or even turned on a lathe, is full of that which is opposite to the fifth thing. For everywhere it has contact with the straight. But the circle itself, we say, has nothing in either smaller or greater, of that which is its opposite. We say also that the name is not a thing of permanence for any of them, and that nothing prevents the things now called round from being called straight, and the straight things round; for those who make changes and call things by opposite names, nothing will be less permanent (than a name). Again with regard to the definition, if it is made up of names and verbal forms, the same remark holds that there is no sufficiently durable permanence in it. And there is no end to the instances of the ambiguity from which each of the four suffers; but the greatest of them is that which we mentioned a little earlier, that, whereas there are two things, that which has real being, and that which is only a quality, when the soul is seeking to know, not the quality, but the essence, each of the four, presenting to the soul by word and in act that which it is not seeking (i.e., the quality), a thing open to refutation by the senses, being merely the thing presented to the soul in each particular case whether by statement or the act of showing, fills, one may say, every man with puzzlement and perplexity.[...] But in subjects where we try to compel a man to give a clear answer about the fifth, any one of those who are capable of overthrowing an antagonist gets the better of us, and makes the man, who gives an exposition in speech or writing or in replies to questions, appear to most of his hearers to know nothing of the things on which he is attempting to write or speak; for they are sometimes not aware that it is not the mind of the writer or speaker which is proved to be at fault, but the defective nature of each of the four instruments. The process however of dealing with all of these, as the mind moves up and down to each in turn, does after much effort give birth in a well-constituted mind to knowledge of that which is well constituted. [...] Therefore, if men are not by nature kinship allied to justice and all other things that are honourable, though they may be good at learning and remembering other knowledge of various kinds-or if they have the kinship but are slow learners and have no memory-none of all these will ever learn to the full the truth about virtue and vice. For both must be learnt together; and together also must be learnt, by complete and long continued study, as I said at the beginning, the true and the false about all that has real being. After much effort, as names, definitions, sights, and other data of sense, are brought into contact and friction one with another, in the course of scrutiny and kindly testing by men who proceed by question and answer without ill will, with a sudden flash there shines forth understanding about every problem, and an intelligence whose efforts reach the furthest limits of human powers. Therefore every man of worth, when dealing with matters of worth, will be far from exposing them to ill feeling and misunderstanding among men by committing them to writing. In one word, then, it may be known from this that, if one sees written treatises composed by anyone, either the laws of a lawgiver, or in any other form whatever, these are not for that man the things of most worth, if he is a man of worth, but that his treasures are laid up in the fairest spot that he possesses. But if these things were worked at by him as things of real worth, and committed to writing, then surely, not gods, but men \\"have themselves bereft him of his wits\\".","\u041d\u0430\u043b\u0438 \u0438 \u0437\u0430 \u0444\u0438\u043b\u043e\u0441\u043e\u0444\u0430 \u0449\u0435 \u043a\u0430\u0436\u0435\u043c, \u0447\u0435 \u0442\u043e\u0439 \u043e\u0431\u0438\u0447\u0430 \u043c\u044a\u0434\u0440\u043e\u0441\u0442\u0442\u0430, \u043d\u043e \u043d\u0435 \u0435\u0434\u043d\u0430 \u0438\u043b\u0438 \u0434\u0440\u0443\u0433\u0430 \u0447\u0430\u0441\u0442 \u043e\u0442 \u043c\u044a\u0434\u0440\u043e\u0441\u0442\u0442\u0430, \u0430 \u0446\u044f\u043b\u0430\u0442\u0430?","SOCRATES: But you do say that he who is a good rhapsode is also a good general.

On this hypothesis, then, nothing can become or be moved or change.Again, if a thing is capable of any particular motion, it is also capable of the corresponding contrary motion or the corresponding coming to rest, and a thingthat is capable of becoming is also capable of perishing: consequently, what is inprocess of becoming in process of becoming is in process of perishing at the verymoment when it is in process of becoming in process of becoming; since it cannotbe in process of perishing when it is just beginning to become or after it has ceasedto become; for that which is in process of perishing must be in existence.","Cronos, then lord of the world, knew that no mortal nature could endure the temptations of power, and therefore he appointed demons or demi-gods, who are of a superior race, to have dominion over man, as man has dominion over the animals","Only the body and its desires cause war, civil discord, and battles, for all wars are due to the desire to acquire wealth, and it is the body and the care of it, to which [d] we are enslaved, which compel us to acquire wealth, and all this makes us too busy to practice philosophy.","No-one is more hated, than he who speaks the truth.\\"- (Plato)","And if there were only some way of contriving that a state or an army should be made up of lovers and their beloved, they would be the very best governors of their own city, abstaining from all dishonour, and emulating one another in honour; and when fighting at each other\'s side, although a mere handful, they would overcome the world.","-\xbfY no diremos tambi\xe9n, amigo, que los hombres, al ser da\xf1ados, se hacen peores en lo que toca a la virtud humana? -Ni m\xe1s ni menos. -\xbf Y la justicia no es virtud humana? -Tambi\xe9n esto es forzoso. -Necesario es, por tanto, querido amigo, que los hombres que reciben da\xf1o se hagan m\xe1s injustos. -Eso parece.","Every class, then, has plurality of being and infinity of not-being.","what they love pious or holy; and what some of them love and others hate is both or neither. Shall this be our definition of piety and impiety?","It is right to think then, gentlemen, that if the soul is immortal, it requires our care not only for the time we call our life, but for the sake of all time, and that one is in terrible danger if one does not give it that care. If death were escape from everything, it would be a great {145} boon to the wicked to get rid of the body and of their wickedness together with their soul. But now that the soul appears to be immortal, [d] there is no escape from evil or salvation for it except by becoming as good and wise as possible, for the soul goes to the underworld possessing nothing but its education and upbringing, which are said to bring the greatest benefit or harm to the dead right at the beginning of the journey yonder.","The truth is that if you want a well-governed state to be possible, you must find for your future rulers some way of life they like better than government; for only then will you have government by the truly rich, those, that is, whose riches consist not of gold, but of the true happiness of a good and rational life. If you get, in public affairs, men whose life is impoverished and destitute of personal satisfactions, but who hope to snatch some compensation for their own inadequacy from a political career, there can never be good government. They start fighting for power, and the consequent internal and domestic conflicts ruin both them and society.","SOCRATES: And is then all that is just pious? Or is all that is pious just, but not all that is just pious, but some of it is and some is not? [12] EUTHYPHRO: I do not follow what you are saying, Socrates.","I La\xefs who laughed scornfully at Hellas,who kept a swarm of young lovers at my door,I lay my mirror before the Paphian,for I will not see myself as I am now,and cannot see myself as once I was.","We should not allow into our minds the conviction that argumentation has nothing sound about it; much rather we should believe that it is we who are not yet sound and that we must take courage and be eager to attain soundness, you and the others for the sake of your whole life still to come, and I for the sake of death itself.","a human being is the measure of all things. of the things that are, that they are, and of things that are not, that they are not.","E ricordandosi della sua prima dimora e della sapienza che aveva col\xe0 e di quei suoi compagni di prigionia, non credi che si sentirebbe felice del mutamento e proverebbe piet\xe0 per loro?

And therefore the mind of the philosopher alone has wings; and this is just, for he is always, according to the measure of his abilities, clinging in recollection to those things in which God abides, and in beholding which He is what He is. And he who employs aright these memories is ever being initiated into perfect mysteries and alone becomes truly perfect.

That the soul of every man, when it feels violent pleasure or pain in connection with some object, inevitably believes at the same time {122} that what causes such feelings must be very clear and very true, which it is not. Such objects are mostly visible, are they not? Certainly. [d] And doesn\u2019t such an experience tie the soul to the body most completely? How so?

This is what I still, even now, go about searching and investigating in the god\u2019s way, if ever I think one of our people, or a foreigner, is wise; and whenever I don\u2019t find him so, I help the god by proving that the man is not wise.","He aqu\xed por qu\xe9 no tenemos tiempo para pensar en la filosof\xeda; y el mayor de nuestros males consiste en que en el acto de tener tiempo y ponernos a meditar, de repente interviene el cuerpo en nuestras indagaciones, nos embaraza, nos turba y no nos deja discernir la verdad.","Cuando se hizo al hombre part\xedcipe de las cualidades divinas, fue el \xfanico de todos los animales, que a causa del parentesco que le un\xeda con el ser divino, se convenci\xf3 de que existen dioses, les levant\xf3 altares y les dedic\xf3 estatuas.","Fine words butter no parsnips.","is good for anything ought not to calculate the chance of living or dying; he ought only to consider whether in doing anything he is doing right or wrong\u2014acting the part of a good man or of a bad.","Cuando se trata de los negocios que corresponden puramente a la pol\xedtica, como la pol\xedtica versa siempre sobre la justicia y la templanza, entonces escuchan a todo el mundo y con raz\xf3n, porque todos est\xe1n obligados a tener estas virtudes, pues que de otra manera no hay sociedad.","we become what we contemplate.","In the first place, the lords of philosophy have never, from their youth upwards, known their way to the Agora, or the dicastery, or the council, or any other political assembly; they neither see nor hear the laws or decrees, as they are called, of the state written or recited; the eagerness of political societies in the attainment of offices\u2014clubs, and banquets, and revels, and singing-maidens,\u2014do not enter even into their dreams. Whether any event has turned out well or ill in the city, what disgrace may have descended to any one from his ancestors, male or female, are matters of which the philosopher no more knows than he can tell, as they say, how many pints are contained in the ocean.

For he does not hold aloof in order that he may gain a reputation; but the truth is, that the outer form of him only is in the city: his mind, disdaining the littlenesses and nothingnesses of human things, is \'flying all abroad\' as Pindar says, measuring earth and heaven and the things which are under and on the earth and above the heaven, interrogating the whole nature of each and all in their entirety, but not condescending to anything which is within reach.","\xc9ste es en general el error de la juventud: contentarse con semiverdades y creer conocer lo que no conoce; sobre todo, \xe9ste era el de la juventud ateniense en la \xe9poca de S\xf3crates y de Plat\xf3n, viciada como estaba por los sofistas.","Y bien; purificar el alma, \xbfno es, como antes dec\xedamos, separarla del cuerpo, y acostumbrarla a encerrarse y recogerse en s\xed misma, renunciando al comercio con aquel cuanto sea posible, y viviendo, sea en esta vida, sea en la otra, sola y desprendida del cuerpo, como quien se desprende de una cadena?","You seem to think me inferior to the swans in prophecy.

And once a thing is put in writing, the composition, whatever it may be, drifts all over the place, getting into the hands not only of those who understand it, but equally of those who have no business with it; it doesn\'t know how to address the right people, and not address the wrong. [Socrates]","porque si teme, es esclavo.","\xbfConsiderar\xedas como operaci\xf3n propia del caballo o de otro ser cualquiera aquella que s\xf3lo, o de mejor mane\xadra que por otros, pudiera hacerse por \xe9l? \xa0No entiendo \xa0dijo. \xa0Sea esto: \xbfpuedes ver con otra cosa que con los ojos? \xa0No de cierto. \xa0\xbfO acaso o\xedr con algo distinto de los o\xeddos? \xa0De ning\xfan modo. \xa0\xbfNo podr\xedamos, pues, decir que \xe9sas son operacio\xadnes propias de ellos? \xa0Bien de cierto.","I understand; you mean that he will be a ruler in the city of which we are the founders, and which exists in idea only; for I do not believe that there is such an one anywhere on earth? In heaven, I replied, there is laid up a pattern of it, methinks, which he who desires may behold, and beholding, may set his own house in order. But whether such an one exists, or ever will exist in fact, is no matter; for he will live after the manner of that city, having nothing to do with any other.","K\xf6t\xfcl\xfck \xf6l\xfcmden daha h\u0131zl\u0131 ko\u015far.","WISE MEN SPEAK BECAUSE THEY HAVE SOMETHING TO SAY;FOOLS BECAUSE THEY HAVE TO SAY SOMETHING.","Costoro sanno che la filosofia, accorgendosi del potere di questa prigione, terribile perch\xe9 opera attraverso i desideri (e per questo chi \xe8 prigioniero \xe8 complice della sua stessa prigionia), quelli che amano il sapere sanno che la filosofia, prendendo la loro anima in queste condizioni, dolcemente la esorta e cerca di liberarla.","El m\xe1s honrado y el m\xe1s sencillo no es reprimir a los dem\xe1s, sino prepararse para ser lo mejor posible.","You must honour and obey and conciliate your country when angry, more than a father; you must either persuade her, or do whatever she commands; you must bear in quiet anything she bids you bear, be it stripes or prison; or if she leads you to war, to be wounded or to die, this you must do, and it is right; you must not give way or retreat or leave your post, but in war and in court and everywhere you must do whatever city and country commands, or else convince her where the right lies. Violence is not allowed against mother or father, much less against your country.","I have heard a philosopher say that at this moment we are actually dead, and that the body (soma) is our tomb (sema), and that the part of the soul which is the seat of the desires is liable to be tossed about by words and blown up and down; and some ingenious person, probably a Sicilian or an Italian, playing with the word, invented a tale in which he called the soul-because of its believing and make-believe nature-a vessel, and the ignorant he called the uninitiated or leaky, and the place in the souls of the uninitiated in which the desires are seated, being the intemperate and incontinent part, he compared to a vessel full of holes, because it can never be satisfied.","Wenn etwas irgendwie wird, oder irgend etwas leidet: so wird es nicht, weil es ein Werdendes ist, sondern weil es wird ist es ein Werdendes; noch weil es ein Leidendes ist leidet es; sondern weil es leidet, ist es ein Leidendes.","But far more dangerous are the others, who began when you were children, and took possession of your minds with their falsehoods, telling of one Socrates, a wise man, who speculated about the heaven above, and searched into the earth beneath, and made the worse appear the better cause. The disseminators of this tale are the accusers whom I dread; for their hearers are apt to fancy that such enquirers do not believe in the existence of the gods. And they are many, and their charges against me are of ancient date, and they were made by them in the days when you were more impressible than you are now\u2014in childhood, or it may have been in youth\u2014and the cause when heard went by default, for there was none to answer. And hardest of all, I do not know and cannot tell the names of my accusers; unless in the chance case of a Comic poet.","EUTHYPHRO: The truth is, Socrates, that I\u2019m at a loss as to how to say what I want to say; somehow or other whatever we put forward has a habit of moving around and refusing to stay wherever we try to make it stand.","Ahora pienso que podr\xe1s entender mejor lo que \xfaltimamente preguntaba al informarme de si era opera\xadci\xf3n propia de cada cosa aquello que realiza ella sola o ella mejor que las dem\xe1s. \xa0Lo entiendo \xa0dijo\xa0, y me parece que \xe9sa es, efec\xadtivamente, la operaci\xf3n propia de cada una. \xa0Bien \xa0dije\xa0; \xbfte parece que hay tambi\xe9n una virtud en cada una de las cosas a que se atribuye una operaci\xf3n? Volvamos a los mismos ejemplos: \xbfhay una operaci\xf3n propia de los ojos? \xa0La hay. \xa0Y as\xed, \xbfhay tambi\xe9n una virtud en ellos? \xa0Tambi\xe9n una virtud. \xa0\xbfY qu\xe9? \xbfNo hab\xeda tambi\xe9n una operaci\xf3n propia de los o\xeddos? \xa0S\xed. \xa0\xbfY, por tanto, tambi\xe9n una virtud? \xa0Tambi\xe9n. \xa0\xbfY no ocurrir\xe1 lo mismo con todas las otras cosas? \xa0Lo mismo. \xa0Bien est\xe1: \xbfacaso los ojos podr\xe1n realizar bien su operaci\xf3n sin su propia virtud, con vicio en lugar de ella? \xa0\xbfQu\xe9 quieres decir? \xa0pregunt\xf3\xa0. Acaso hablas de la ceguera en vez de la visi\xf3n. \xa0De la virtud de ellos, sea cual sea \xa0dije yo\xa0; porque todav\xeda no pregunto esto, sino si se realizar\xe1 bien su ope\xadraci\xf3n con su propia virtud y mal con el vicio contrario. \xa0Dices bien \xa0respondi\xf3. \xa0\xbfY del mismo modo los o\xeddos privados de su virtud realizar\xe1n mal su propia operaci\xf3n? \xa0Bien de cierto. \xa0\xbfPonemos, en fin, todas las dem\xe1s cosas en la misma cuenta? \xa0Eso creo. \xa0Vamos, pues, adelante y atiende a esto otro: \xbfhay una operaci\xf3n propia del alma que no puedes realizar sino por ella? Pongo por caso: el dirigir, el gobernar, el delibe\xadrar y todas las cosas de esta \xedndole, podr\xedamos atribu\xedrse\xadlas a algo que no sea el alma misma o dir\xedamos que son propias de \xe9sta? \xa0De ella s\xf3lo. \xa0\xbfY respecto de la vida? \xbfNo diremos que es operaci\xf3n del alma? \xa0Sin duda \xa0dijo. \xa0\xbfNo diremos, pues, que existe una virtud propia del alma? \xa0Lo diremos. \xa0\xbfY acaso, oh Tras\xedmaco, el alma realizar\xe1 bien sus ope\xadraciones privada de su propia virtud o ser\xe1 ello imposible? \xa0Imposible. \xa0Fuerza ser\xe1, por tanto, que el alma mala dirija y go\xadbierne mal y que la buena haga bien todas estas cosas. \xa0Fuerza ser\xe1. \xa0\xbfY no convinimos en que la justicia era virtud del alma y la injusticia vicio? \xa0En eso convinimos, en efecto. \xa0Por tanto, el alma justa y el hombre justo vivir\xe1 bien; y el injusto mal. \xa0As\xed aparece conforme a lo argumento \xa0dijo. \xa0Y, por otra parte, el que vive bien es feliz y dichoso, y el que vive mal, lo contrario. \xa0\xbfC\xf3mo no? \xa0Y as\xed, el justo es dichoso; y el injusto, desgraciado. \xa0Sea \xa0dijo. \xa0Por otro lado, no conviene ser desgraciado, sino di\xadchoso. \xa0\xbfQu\xe9 duda tiene? \xa0Por tanto, bendito Tras\xedmaco, jam\xe1s es la injusticia m\xe1s provechosa que la justicia. \xa0Banquet\xe9ate con todo eso, \xa1oh, S\xf3crates!, en las fies\xadtas Bendidias di dijo. \xa0Banquete que t\xfa me has preparado, \xa1oh, Tras\xedmaco! \xa0observ\xe9 yo\xa0, pues lo aplacaste conmigo y cesaste en lo enfado. Mezquino va a ser, sin embargo, no por lo culpa, sino por la m\xeda; y es que, as\xed como los golosos gustan siempre con arrebato del manjar que en cada momento se les sirve sin haber gozado debidamente del anterior, as\xed me parece que yo, sin averiguar lo que primeramente consider\xe1bamos, qu\xe9 cosa sea lo justo, me desprend\xed del asunto y me lanc\xe9 a investigar acerca de ello, si era vicio e ignorancia o discreci\xf3n y virtud; y present\xe1ndose luego un nuevo aserto, que la injusticia es m\xe1s provechosa que la justicia, no me retraje de pasar a \xe9l, dejando el otro, de modo que ahora me acontece no saber nada como resul\xadtado de la discusi\xf3n. Porque no sabiendo lo que es lo justo, dif\xedcil es que sepa si es virtud o no y si el que la po\xadsee es desgraciado o dichoso.","anarchy should have no place in the life of man or of the beasts who are subject to man.","-Y lo que nos lleva al recuerdo de la desgracia y a las lamentaciones, sin saciarse nunca de ellas, \xbfno diremos que es irracional y perezoso y allegado de la cobard\xeda."]')}}]);
