He was a martyr. Like many martyrs, he held extreme views.","The Image is more than an idea. It is a vortex or cluster of fused ideas and is endowed with energy.","Wars are made to make debt.","Be not cheap or mediocre in desiring.","There is no reason why the same man should like the same books at eighteen and at forty-eight","I guess the definition of a lunatic is a man surrounded by them.","Sovereignty inheres in the right to issue money. And the American sovereignty belongs by right to the people, and their representatives in Congress have the right to issue money and to determine the value thereof. And 120 million, 120 million suckers have lamentably failed to insist on the observation of this quite decided law. ... Now the point at which embezzlement of the nation\'s funds on the part of her officers becomes treason can probably be decided only by jurists, and not by hand-picked judges who support illegality.","In our time, the curse is monetary illiteracy, just as inability to read plain print was the curse of earlier centuries.","I found after seventy years that I was not a lunatic but a moron.... I should have been able to do better.","All my life I believed I knew something. But then one strange day came when I realized that I knew nothing, yes, I knew nothing.  And so words became void of meaning.  I have arrived too late at ultimate uncertainty.","The sum of human wisdom is not contained in any one language.","The history of an art is the history of masterwork, not of failures, or mediocrity.","Use no word that under stress of emotion you could not actually say.","The primary pigment of poetry is the IMAGE.","To say that a state cannot pursue its aims because there is no money, is like saying that an engineer cannot build roads, because there are no kilometers.","Use no superfluous word, no adjective, which does not reveal something.","Man is an over-complicated organism.  If he is doomed to extinction he will die out for want of simplicity.","The only chance for victory over the brainwash is the right of every man to have his ideas judged one at a time.

Don\'t use such an expression as \'dim land of peace.\' It dulls the image. It mixes an abstraction with the concrete. It comes from the writer\'s not realizing that the natural object is always the adequate symbol. Go in fear of abstraction.","The artist is always beginning. Any work of art which is not a beginning, an invention, a discovery is of little worth.","Poetry is a sort of inspired mathematics, which gives us equations, not for abstract figures, triangles, squares, and the like, but for the human emotions.

Only what has been written against the market.","The artist is the antenna of the race.","Until you know who has lent what to whom, you know nothing whatever of politics, you know nothing whatever of history, you know nothing of international wrangles.","Seems fairly clear that you fix a breed by LIMITING the amount of alien infiltration. You make a race by homogeneity and by avoiding INbreeding.... No argument has ever been sprouted against it. You like it in dogs and horses.","The art of letters will come to an end before A.D. 2000. I shall survive as a curiosity.","The individual cannot think and communicate his thought, the governor and legislator cannot act effectively or frame his laws without words, and the solidity and validity of these words is in the care of the damned and despised litterati...when their very medium, the very essence of their work, the application of word to thing goes rotten, i.e. becomes slushy and inexact, or excessive or bloated, the whole machinery of social and of individual thought and order goes to pot.","One discards rhyme, not because one is incapable of rhyming neat, fleet, sweet, meet, treat, eat, feet but because there are certain emotions or energies which are nor represented by the over-familiar devices or patterns.","Literature is news that stays news.","What matters most is not the idea, but the capacity to believe in it completely.","There is natural ignorance and there is artificial ignorance. I should say at the present moment the artificial ignorance is about eighty-five per cent.","Humanity is the rich effluvium, it is the waste and the manure and the soil, and from it grows the tree of the arts.","Come, let us pity those who are better off than we are.

It is an art of pure sound bound in through an art of arbitrary and conventional symbols.","The flavors of the peach and the apricot are not lost from generation to generation. Neither are they transmitted by book learning.","The modern artist must live by craft and violence. His gods are violent gods. Those artists, so called, whose work does not show this strife, are uninteresting.","Any damn fool can be spontaneous.","A civilized man is one who will give a serious answer to a serious question. Civilization itself is a certain sane balance of values.","Anyone who is too lazy to master the comparatively small glossary necessary to understand Chaucer deserves to be shut out from the reading of good books forever.","Properly, we should read for power. Man reading should be man intensely alive. The book should be a ball of light in one\'s hand.","Learn of the green world what can be thy place\\nIn scaled invention or true artistry","The man of understanding can no more sit quiet and resigned while his country lets its literature decay, and lets good writing meet with contempt, than a good doctor could sit quiet and contented while some ignorant child was infecting itself with tuberculosis under the impression that it was merely eating jam tarts.","Discoveries are made by gluttons and addicts. The man who forgets to eat and sleep has an appetite for fact, for interrelations among causes.","We do NOT know the past in chronological sequence. It may be convenient to lay it out anesthetized on the table with dates pasted on here and there, but what we know we know by ripples and spirals eddying out from us and from our own time.","A people that grows accustomed to sloppy writing is a people in the process of losing grip on its empire and on itself.","Poets who are not interested in music are, or become, bad poets.","In case I conk out, this is provisionally what I have to do: I must clarify obscurities; I must make clearer definite ideas or dissociations. I must find a verbal formula to combat the rise of brutality--the principle of order versus the split atom.","Any general statement is like a check drawn on a bank. Its value depends on what is there to meet it.","Religion I have defined as \\"Another of those numerous failures resulting from an attempt to popularize art\\".","Glance is the enemy of vision.","A great age of literature is perhaps always a great age of translations.","And the good writer chooses his words for their \'meaning\', but that meaning is not a a set, cut-off thing like the move of knight or pawn on a chess-board. It comes up with roots, with associations, with how and where the word is familiarly used, or where it has been used brilliantly or memorably.","Utter originality is, of course, out of the question.","The secret of popular writing is never to put more on a given page than the common reader can lap off it with no strain whatsoever on his habitually slack attention.","A man of genius has a right to any mode of expression.","No good poetry is ever written in a manner twenty years old, for to write in such a manner shows conclusively that the writer thinks from books, convention and clich\xe9, not from real life.","The worst mistake I made was that stupid, suburban prejudice of anti-Semitism.","If I could believe the Quakers banned music because church music is so damn bad, I should view them with approval.","Better mendacities Than the classics in paraphrase! Some quick to arm, some for adventure, some from fear of weakness, some from fear of censure, some for love of slaughter, in imagination, learning later . . . some in fear, learning love of slaughter; Died some, pro patria, non \\"dulce\\" non \\"et decor\\" . walked eye-deep in hell believing in old men\'s lies, the unbelieving came home, home to a lie.","Literature does not exist in a vacuum. Writers as such have a definite social function exactly proportional to their ability as writers. This is their main use.","I have always thought the suicide should bump off at least one swine before taking off for parts unknown.","It ought to be illegal for an artist to marry. If the artist must marry let him find someone more interested in art, or his art, or the artist part of him, than in him. After which let them take tea together three times a week.","And New York is the most beautiful city in the world? It is not far from it. No urban night is like the night there... Squares after squares of flame, set up and cut into the aether. Here is our poetry, for we have pulled down the stars to our will.","I would hold the rosy, slender fingers of the dawn for you.","The difference between a gun and a tree is a difference of tempo. The tree explodes every spring.","All great art is born of the metropolis.","The rustling of the silk is discontinued, Dust drifts over the courtyard, There is not sound of footfall, and the leaves Scurry into heaps and lie still, And she the rejoicer of the heart is beneath them: A wet leaf that clings to the threshold.","It would be about as easy for an American to become a Chinaman or a Hindoo as for him to acquire an Englishness or a Frenchness or a European-ness that is more than half skin deep.","A man\'s hope measures his civilization. The attainability of the hope measures, or may measure, the civilization of his nation and time.","Our own consciousness is incapable of having produce the universe. God, therefore, exists. That is to say, there is no reason for not applying the term God, Theos, to the intimate essence","Take the serious side of Disney, the Confucian side of Disney. It\'s in having taken an ethoswhere you have the values of courage and tenderness asserted in a way that everybody can understand. You have got an absolute genius there. You have got a greater correlation of nature than you have had since the time of Alexander the Great.","If the individual, or heretic, gets hold of some essential truth, or sees some error in the system being practiced, he commits so many marginal errors himself that he is worn out before he can establish his point.","The sum of human wisdom is not contained in any one language, and no single language is capable of expressing all forms and degrees of human comprehension.","The flavors of the peach and the apricot are not lost from generation to generation, neither are they transmitted by book learning. The mystic tradition, any mystic tradition, is of a similar nature, that is, it is dependent on direct perception, a \'knowledge\' as permanent as the faculty for receiving it.","The phase of the usury system which we are trying to analyze is more or less Patterson\'s perception that the Bank of England could have benefit of all the interest on all the money that it creates out of nothing. ... Now the American citizen can, of course, appeal to his constitution, which states that Congress shall have power to coin money or regulate the value thereof and of foreign coin. Such appeal is perhaps quixotic.","Bureaucrats are a pox. They are supposed to be necessary. Certain chemicals in the body are supposed to be necessary to life, but cause death the moment they increase beyond a suitable limit","No teacher has ever failed from ignorance. That is empiric professional knowledge. Teachers fail because they cannot `handle the class.\' Real education must ultimately be limited to men how INSIST on knowing, the rest is mere sheep-herding.","And the betrayers of language ...... n and the press gang And those who had lied for hire; The perverts, the perverters of language, the perverts, who have set money-lust Before the pleasures of the senses; howling, as of a hen-yard in a printing-house, the clatter of presses, the blowing of dry dust and stray paper, foetor, sweat, the stench of stale oranges.","To break the pentameter, that was the first heave","The apparition of these faces in the crowd; Petals on a wet black bough.","A real building is one on which the eye can light and stay lit.","Consider the way of the scientists rather than the way of an advertising agent for a new soap.","Poetry must be as well written as prose.","This is no book. Whoever touches this touches a man.","Here is our poetry, for we have pulled down the stars to our will.","Artists are the antennae of the race.","The artist is always beginning.","Christ can very well stand as an heroic figure. The hero need not be of wisdom all compounded. Also he is not wholly to blame for the religion that\'s been foisted on to him.","The what is so much more important than how.","What thou lovest well remains, the rest is dross What thou lov\'st well shall not be reft from thee What thou lov\'st well is thy true heritage Whose world, or mine or theirs or is it of none? First came the seen, then thus the palpable Elysium, though it were in the halls of hell. What thou lovest well is thy true heritage.","Technique is the test of sincerity.","Objectivity and again objectivity, and expression: no hindside-before-ness, no straddled adjectives (as \\"addled mosses dank\\"), no Tennysonianness of speech; nothing-nothing that you couldn\'t, in some circumstance, in the stress of some emotion, actually say.","From the colour the nature And by the nature the sign! Beatific spirits welding together As in one ash-tree in Ygdrasail.","Science is unpoetic only to minds jaundiced with sentiment and romanticism . . . the great masters of the past boasted all they could of it and found it magical.","The critic who doesn\'t make a personal statement, in remeasurements he himself has made, is merely an unreliable critic. He is not a measurer but a repeater of other men\'s results. KRINO, to pick out for oneself, to choose. That\'s what the word means.","Good art however \'immoral\' is wholly a thing of virtue. Good art can NOT be immoral. By good art I mean art that bears true witness, I mean the art that is most precise.","The serious artist must be as open as nature. Nature does not give all of herself in a paragraph. She is rugged and not set apart into discreet categories.","small talk comes from small bones","With one day\'s reading a man may have the key in his hands.","A little light, like a rushlight / to lead back to splendour.","Rhythm must have meaning.","The act of bell ringing is symbolic of all proselytizing religions. It implies the pointless interference with the quiet of other people.","Properly, we should read for power.","The ant\'s a centaur in his dragon world. Pull down thy vanity, it is not man Made courage, or made order, or made grace, Pull down thy vanity, I say pull down. Learn of the green world what can be thy place In scaled invention or true artistry, Pull down thy vanity, Paquin pull down! The green casque has outdone your elegance.","Compose in the sequence of the musical phrase, not in sequence of a metronome.","Colloquial poetry is to the real art as the barber\'s wax dummy is to sculpture.","I consider criticism merely a preliminary excitement, a statement of things a writer has to clear up in his own head sometime or other, probably antecedent to writing; of no value unless it come to fruit in the created work later.","America, my country, is almost a continent and hardly yet a nation.","People find ideas a bore because they do not distinguish between live ones and stuffed ones on a shelf.","There are few things more difficult than to appraise the work of a man suddenly dead in his youth; to disentangle promise from achievement; to save him from that sentimentalizing which confuses the tragedy of the interruption with the merit of the work actually performed.","It is difficult to write a paradiso when all the superficial indications are that you ought to write an apocalypse.","It is more than likely that the brain itself is, in origin and development, only a sort of great clot of genital fluid held in suspense or reserved. This hypothesis would explain the enormous content of the brain as a maker or presenter of images.","A general loathing of a gang or sect usually has some sound basis in instinct.","The intellect is a very nice whirligig toy, but how people take it seriously is more than I can understand.","That text is known to them that have the patience to read it, possibly one one-hundredth of one percent of the denizens. They forget it, all save a few Western states. I think somebody in Dakota once read it. The Constitution.","Usura slayeth the child in the womb It stayeth the young man\'s courting It hath brought palsey to bed, lyeth between the young bride and her bridegroom","Your mind and you are our Sargasso Sea.","Almost any fool can paint an academy picture, and any imbecile can shoot off a Kodak.","Go to the adolescent who are smothered in family--\\nOh how hideous it is\\nTo see three generations of one house gathered together!\\nIt is like an old tree with shoots,\\nAnd with some branches rotted and falling.","No picture is made to endure nor to live with but it is made to sell and sell quickly with usura, sin against nature, is thy bread ever more of stale rags is thy bread dry as paper.","Art is to be admired rather than explained. The jargon of these sculptors is beyond me. I do not precisely know why I admire a green granite, female, apparently pregnant monster with one eye going around a square corner.","The thought of what America would be like If the Classics had a wide circulation Troubles my sleep (Cantico del Sole)","Poetry is about as much a \'criticism of life\' as red-hot iron is a criticism of fire.","The book shd. be a ball of light in one\'s hand.","What counts is the cultural level","install me in any profession\\nSave this damn\'d profession of writing,\\nwhere one needs one\'s brains all the time.","Somebody said that I am the last American living the tragedy of Europe.","The author\'s conviction on this day of New Year is that music begins to atrophy when it departs too far from the dance; that poetry begins to atrophy when it gets too far from music; but this must not be taken as implying that all good music is dance music or all poetry lyric. Bach and Mozart are never too far from physical movement.","But the one thing you should. not do is to suppose that when something is wrong with the arts, it is wrong with the arts ONLY.","It is better to present one image in a lifetime than to produce voluminous work. Image...that which presents an intellectual and emotional complex in an instant of time.","We live in an age of science and of abundance. The care and reverence for books as such, proper to an age when no book was duplicated until someone took the pains to copy it out by hand, is obviously no longer suited to \u2019the needs of society\u2019, or to the conservation of learning. The weeder is supremely needed if the Garden of the Muses is to persist as a garden.","I think an alliance with Stalin\'s Russia is rotten.","Mass ought to be in Latin, unless you could do it in Greek or Chinese.  In fact, any abracadabra that no bloody member of the public or half-educated ape of a clargimint could think he understood.","Fit for kings, formal gardens afford an earthly Elysium and the odd impression that we mere men might actually control nature for a time.","I once saw a small child go to an electric light switch as say, Mamma, can I open the light? She was using the age-old language of exploration, the language of art.","My pawing over the ancients and semi-ancients has been one struggle to find out what has been done, once and for all, better than it can ever be done again, and to find out what remains for us to do, and plenty does remain, for if we still feel the same emotions as those who launched a thousand ships, it is quite certain that we came on these feelings differently, through different nuances, by different intellectual gradations. Each age has its own abounding gifts yet only some ages transmute them into matters of duration.","where the dead walked and the living were made of cardboard.","Artists are the antennae of the race, but the bullet-headed many will never learn to trust the great artists.","With Usura With usura hath no man a house of good stone each block cut smooth and well fitting.","The eyes of this dead lady speak to me For here was love, was not to be drowned out. And here desire, not to be kissed away. The eyes of this dead lady speak to me.","Yet the companions of the Muses\\nwill keep their collective nose in my books\\nAnd weary with historical data, they will turn to my dance tune.","I ask a wreathwhich will not crush my head.\\nAnd there is no hurry about it;\\nI shall have, doubtless, a boom after my funeral,\\nSeeing that long standing increases all things\\nregardless of quality.","There is no topicmore soporific and generally boring than the topic of Ireland as Ireland, as a nation.","\'Tis the white stag, Fame, we\'re a-hunting, bid the world\'s hounds come to horn!","I dunno what my 23 infantile years in America signify. I left as soon as motion was autarchic -- I mean my motion.","Song in the Manner of Housman\\" O woe, woe, People are born and die, We also shall be dead pretty soon Therefore let us act as if we were dead already. The bird sits on the hawthorn tree But he dies also, presently. Some lads get hung, and some get shot. Woeful is this human lot. Woe! woe, etcetera.... London is a woeful place, Shropshire is much pleasanter. Then let us smile a little space Upon fond nature\'s morbid grace. Oh, Woe, woe, woe, etcetera.","Technique is the test of sincerity.

See, they return, one, and by one, With fear, as half-awakened; As if the snow should hesitate And murmur in the wind, and half turn back.","I should consent to breed under pressure, if I were convinced in any way of the reasonableness of reproducing the species. But my nerves and the nerves of any woman I could live with three months, would produce only a victim... lacking in impulse, a mere bundle of discriminations. If I were wealthy I might subsidize a stud of young peasants, or a tribal group in Tahiti.","You have been second always. Tragical? No. You preferred it to the usual thing: One dull man, dulling and uxorious, One average mind- with one thought less, each year.","A crowd pagan as ever imperial Rome was, eager, careless, with an animal vigour unlike that of any European crowd that I have ever looked at.","And in the mean time my songs will travel,\\nAnd the devirginated young ladies will enjoy them\\nwhen they have got over the strangeness","Allow me to say that I would long since have committed suicide had desisting made me a professor of Latin.","As for literature It gives no man a sinecure.

It has, time and again, driven men to great living, it has given them courage to go on for decades in the face of public stupidity. It is paradisical and a reward in itself seeking naught further... perhaps because a feeling of certitude inheres in the state of feeling itself. The glory of life exists without further proof for this mystic.","When the head of state of family thinks first of gouging out an income, he must perforce do it through small men; and even if they are clever at their job, if one employ such inferior characters in state and family business the tilled fields will go rack swamp and ruin and edged calamities will mount up to the full.... This is the meaning of: A state does not profit by profits - Pound\'s translation of Confucius","A great spirit has been amongst us, and a great artist is gone.","Yes, but bad language is bound to make in addition bad government, whereas good language is not bound to make bad government. That again is clear Confucius: if the orders aren\u2019t clear they can\u2019t be carried out. Lloyd George\u2019s laws were such a mess, the lawyers never knew what they meant. And Talleyrand proclaimed that they changed the meaning of words between one conference and another. The means of communication breaks down, and that of course is what we are suffering now. We are enduring the drive to work on the subconscious without appealing to the reason. They repeat a trade name with the music a few times, and then repeat the music without it so that the music will give you the name. I think of the assault. We suffer from the use of language to conceal thought and to withhold all vital and direct answers. There is the definite use of propaganda, forensic language, merely to conceal and mislead.","There is the mystery of the scattering, the fact that the people who presumably understand each other are geographically scattered.

Be influenced by as many great artists as you can, but have the decency either to acknowledge the debt outright, or try to conceal it.Don\'t allow \\"influence\\" to mean merely that you mop up the particular decorative vocabulary of some one or two poets who you happen to admire.","Pay no attention to the criticism of men who have never themselves written a notable work.

Organizations for writers palliate the writer\'s loneliness but I doubt if they improve his writing. He grows in public stature as he sheds his loneliness and often his work deteriorates. For he does his work alone and if he is a good enough writer he must face eternity, or the lack of it, each day.\u201cFor a true writer each book should be a new beginning where he tries again for something that is beyond attainment. He should always try for something that has never been done or that others have tried and failed. Then sometimes, with great luck, he will succeed.\u201cHow simple the writing of literature would be if it were only necessary to write in another way what has been well written. It is because we have had such great writers in the past that a writer is driven far out past where he can go, out to where no one can help him. -- Ernest Hemingway\u201d","Pull down thy vanity, it is not manMade courage, or made order, or made grace, Pull down thy vanity I say pull down Learn of the green-world what can be thy place","As cool as the pale wet leaves  of lily-of-the-valleyShe lay beside me in the dawn.","You hate translation???
