It is only the details of how he lived and how he died that distinguish one man from another.","War is no longer made by simply analyzed economic forces if it ever was.

Don\u2019t ever kid yourself about loving some one. It is just that most people are not lucky enough ever to have it. You never had it before and now you have it. What you have with Maria, whether it lasts just through today and a part of tomorrow, or whether it lasts for a long life is the most important thing that can happen to a human being. There will always be people who say it does not exist because they cannot have it.

(The man who first said that) was probably a coward.... He knew a great deal about cowards but nothing about the brave. The brave dies perhaps two thousand deaths if he\'s intelligent.

Part of you died each year when the leaves fell from the trees and their branches were bare against the wind and the cold, wintery light.

When the cold rains kept on and killed the spring, it was as though a young person died for no reason.","The smallest coffins are the heaviest.","Anyone who says he wants to be a writer and isn\'t writing, doesn\'t.","Wine ... offers a greater range for enjoyment and appreciation than possibly any other purely sensory thing which may be purchased.","Never sit a table when you can stand at the bar.","There are only three sports: bullfighting, motor racing, and mountaineering; all the rest are merely games.","My aim is to put down on paper what I see and what I feel in the best and simplest way.","Every damn thing is your own fault, if you are any good.","First, there must be talent. . .Then there must be discipline. . .Then there must be. . .and absolute conscience. . .to prevent faking.","I\u2019m not brave any more darling. I\u2019m all broken. They\u2019ve broken me.","I\u2019m trying in all my stories to get the feeling of the actual life across\u2014not to just depict life\u2014or criticize it\u2014but to actually make it alive. So that when you have read something by me you actually experience the thing. You can\u2019t do this without putting in the bad and the ugly as well as what is beautiful. Because if it is all beautiful you can\u2019t believe in it. Things aren\u2019t that way.","The only thing that could spoil a day was people. People were always the limiters of happiness except for the very few that were as good as spring itself.","Only one marriage I regret.

Never worn.","Easy writing makes hard reading.","The best way is always to stop when you are going good and when you know what will happen next. If you do that every day when you are writing a novel you will never be stuck. That is the most valuable thing I can tell you so try to remember it.","I\'m tired of everybody. Please forgive me.","To be able to say: I loved this person, we had a hell of a nice time together, it\'s over but in a way it will never be over and I do know that I for sure loved this person, to be able to say that and mean it, that\'s rare. That\'s rare and valuable.","No one ever stopped when they were winning.","At night, never go to bed without knowing what you\'ll write tomorrow.","A bottle of wine was good company.","To hell with luck. I\'ll bring the luck with me.","In going where you have to go, and doing what you have to do, and seeing what you have to see, you\'ll dull and blunt the instrument you write with.

If you do that every day ... you will never be stuck. Always stop while you are going good and don\'t think about it or worry about it until you start to write the next day. That way your subconscious will work on it all the time. But if you think about it consciously or worry about it you will kill it and your brain will be tired before you start.","You\u2019re my religion. You\u2019re all I\u2019ve got.","Find what gave you emotion; what the action was that gave you excitement. Then write it down making it clear so that the reader can see it too. Prose is architecture, not interior decoration, and the Baroque is over.","Writing is a hard business...but nothing makes you feel better.","Don\'t you ever get the feeling that all your life is going by and you\'re not taking advantage of it? Do you realize you\'ve lived nearly half the time you have to live already?","I thought that all generations were lost by something and always had been and always would be","Life breaks all of us but some of us get stronger in the broken places.","All bad writers are in love with the epic.","Write hard and clear about what hurts.","Perhaps I should not have been a fisherman, he thought. But that was the thing that I was born for.","There are many good fishermen and some great ones. But there is only one you.","All good books are alike in that they are truer than if they had really happened and after you are finished reading one you will feel that all that happened to you and afterwards it all belongs to you: the good and the bad, the ecstasy, the remorse and sorrow, the people and the places and how the weather was. If you can get so that you can give that to people, then you are a writer.","All my life I\'ve looked at words as though I were seeing them for the first time.","Happiness is often presented as being very dull but, he thought, lying awake, that is because dull people are sometimes very happy and intelligent people can and do go around making themselves and everyone else miserable. He had never found happiness dull. It always seemed more exciting than any other thing and capable of as great intensity as sorrow to those people who were capable of having it.","When people talk, listen completely. Most people never listen.","He rested sitting on the un-stepped mast and sail and tried not to think but only to endure.","My working habits are simple: long periods of thinking, short periods of writing.","You could omit anything if you knew that the omitted part would strengthen the short story and make people feel something more than they understood","As I ate the oysters with their strong taste of the sea and their faint metallic taste that the cold white wine washed away, leaving only the sea taste and the succulent texture, and as I drank their cold liquid from each shell and washed it down with the crisp taste of the wine, I lost the empty feeling and began to be happy and to make plans.","Man is not made for defeat.","There is no rule on how to write.","Ronda is the place where to go, if you are planning to travel to Spain for a honeymoon or for being with a girlfriend. The whole city and its surroundings are a romantic set. ... Nice promenades, good wine, excellent food, nothing to do.","I was so sentimental about you I\'d break any one\'s heart for you. My, I was a damned fool. I broke my own heart, too. It\'s broken and gone. Everything I believe in and everything I cared about I left for you because you were so wonderful and you loved me so much that love was all that mattered. Love was the greatest thing, wasn\'t it?","All our words from loose using have lost their edge.","You cannot stop trusting people in life but I have learned to be a little bit careful. The way to make people trust-worthy is to trust them.","In the morning there was a big wind blowing and the waves were running high up on the beach and he was awake a long time before he remembered that his heart was broken.","And how much better to die in all the happy period of undisillusioned youth, to go out in a blaze of light, than to have your body worn out and old and illusions shattered.","Why, darling, I don\'t live at all when I\'m not with you.","There are only two places in the world where we can live happy: at home and in Paris.","All modern American literature comes from one book by Mark Twain called Huckleberry Finn.","Hunger is good discipline.","For what are we born if not to aid one another?","When you have a child, the world has a hostage.","There are the two curses of Spain, the bulls and the priests.","Every day above earth is a good day.","Decadence is a difficult word to use since it has become little more than a term of abuse applied by critics to anything they do not yet understand or which seems to differ from their moral concepts.","It is by riding a bicycle that you learn the contours of a country best, since you have to sweat up the hills and coast down them.","The best writing is certainly when you are in love","Imagination? It is the one thing beside honesty that a good writer must have. The more he learns from experience the more he can imagine.","I always worked until I had something done and I always stopped when I knew what was going to happen next. That way I could be sure of going on the next day.","Hesitation increases in relation to risk in equal proportion to age.","I would stand and look out over the roofs of Paris and think, \\"Do not worry. You have always written before and you will write now. All you have to do is write one true sentence. Write the truest sentence that you know.","All the contact I have had with politics has left me feeling as though I had been drinking out of spitoons.","Everyone behaves badly--given the chance.","Cowardice, as distinguished from panic, is almost always simply a lack of ability to suspend the functioning of the imagination.","You know that fiction, prose rather, is possibly the roughest trade of all in writing. You do not have the reference, the old important reference. You have the sheet of blank paper, the pencil, and the obligation to invent truer than things can be true. You have to take what is not palpable and make it completely palpable and also have it seem normal and so that it can become a part of experience of the person who reads it.","As long as you can start, you are all right. The juice will come.","Never think that war, no matter how necessary, nor how justified, is not a crime.","Everybody is friends when things are bad enough.","You can write any time people will leave you alone and not interrupt you. Or rather you can if you will be ruthless enough about it. But the best writing is certainly when you are in love.","Worry destroys the ability to write. Ill health is bad in the ratio that it produces worry which attacks your subconscious and destroys your reserves.","I can\'t stand it to think my life is going so fast and I\'m not really living it.","As you get older it is harder to have heroes, but it is sort of necessary.","I learned never to empty the well of my writing, but always to stop when there was still something there in the deep part of the well, and let it refill at night from the springs that fed it.","No weapon has ever settled a moral problem. It can impose a solution but it cannot guarantee it to be a just one. You can wipe out your opponents. But if you do it unjustly you become eligible for being wiped out yourself.","If a writer stops observing, he is finished.","Why do old men wake so early? Is it to have one longer day?","Kilimanjaro is a snow-covered mountain 19,710 feet high, and is said to be the highest mountain in Africa. Its western summit is called the Masai \'Ngaje Ngai\', the House of God. Close to the western summit there is a dried and frozen carcas of a leopard. No one has explained what the leopard was seeking at that altitude.","Because Fascism is a lie, it is condemned to literary sterility. And when it is past, it will have no history, except the bloody history of murder.","Details make stories human, and the more human a story can be, the better.","The clouds were building up now for the trade wind and he looked ahead and saw a flight of wild ducks etching themselves against the sky over the water, then blurring, then etching again and he knew no man was ever alone on the sea.","Writing, at its best, is a lonely life.","For a true writer each book should be a new beginning where he tries again for something that is beyond attainment. He should always try for something that has never been done or that others have tried and failed. Then sometimes, with great luck, he will succeed.","As a writer, you should not judge, you should understand.","What difference does it make if you live in a picturesque little outhouse surrounded by 300 feeble minded goats and your faithful dog? The question is: Can you write?","Worry destroys the ability to write.","But man is not made for defeat. A man can be destroyed but not defeated.","But in the night he woke and held her tight as though she were all of life and it was being taken from him. He held her feeling she was all of life there was and it was true.","I believe that basically you write for two people; yourself to try to make it absolutely perfect; or if not that then wonderful. Then you write for who you love whether she can read or write or not and whether she is alive or dead.","I didn\'t want to kiss you goodbye \u2014 that was the trouble \u2014 I wanted to kiss you good night \u2014 and there\'s a lot of difference.","The writer\'s job is not to judge, but to seek to understand.","Actually if a writer needs a dictionary he should not write. He should have read the dictionary at least three times from beginning to end and then have loaned it to someone who needs it. There are only certain words which are valid and similes (bring me my dictionary) are like defective ammunition (the lowest thing I can think of at this time).","I still need more healthy rest in order to work at my best. My health is the main capital I have and I want to administer it intelligently.","When you work hard all day with your head and know you must work again the next day what else can change your ideas and make them run on a different plane like whisky?","It is appearances, characteristics and performance that make a man love an airplane, and they, are what put emotion into one. You love a lot of things if you live around them, but there isn\'t any woman and there isn\'t any horse, nor any before nor any after, that is as lovely as a great airplane, and men who love them are faithful to them even though they leave them for others. A man has only one virginity to lose in fighters, and if it is a lovely plane he loses it to, there his heart will ever be.","They wrote in the old days that it is sweet and fitting to die for one\'s country. But in modern war, there is nothing sweet nor fitting in your dying. You will die like a dog for no good reason.","There is no left and right in writing.

It smelled of early morning, of swept dust, spoons in coffee-glasses and the wet circles left by wine glasses.","There will always be people who say it does not exist because they cannot have it. But I tell you it is true and that you have it and that you are lucky even if you die tomorrow.","The further you go in writing the more alone you are.","If my Valentine you won\'t be, I\'ll hang myself on your Christmas tree.","There isnt always an explanation for everything.","In a power hungry, power worshipping society, men label themselves atheist.","The whiskey warmed his tongue and the back of his throat, but it did not change his ideas any, and suddenly, looking at himself in the mirror behind the bar, he knew that drinking was never going to do any good to him now. Whatever he had now he had, and it was from now on, and if he drank himself unconscious when he woke up it would be there.","Writing is something that you can never do as well as it can be done. It is a perpetual challenge and it is more difficult than anything else that I have ever done.","Everything about him was old except his eyes and they were the same color as the sea and were cheerful and undefeated.","But life isn\'t hard to manage when you\'ve nothing to lose.","In the spring mornings I would work early while my wife still slept. The windows were open wide and the cobbles of the street were drying after the rain.","Having books published is very destructive to writing. It is even worse than making love too much. Because when you make love too much at least you get a damned clarte that is like no other light. A very clear and hollow light.","So this was how you died, in whispers that you did not hear.","You belong to me and all Paris belongs to me and I belong to this notebook and this pencil.","A girl came in the cafe and sat by herself at a table near the window. She was very pretty with a face fresh as a newly minted coin if they minted coins in smooth flesh with rain-freshened skin, and her hair black as a crow\'s wing and cut sharply and diagonally across her cheek.","Why did they make birds so delicate and fine as those sea swallows when the ocean can be so cruel?","Retirement is the ugliest word in the language.","They say the seeds of what we will do are in all of us, but it always seemed to me that in those who make jokes in life the seeds are covered with better soil and with a higher grade of manure.","A person with increasing knowledge and sensory education may derive infinite enjoyment from wine.","You can write any time people will leave you alone and not interrupt you. Or rather you can if you will be ruthless enough about it. But the best writing is certainly when you are in love. If it is all the same to you I would rather not expound on that.","I was trying to write then and I found the greatest difficulty, aside from knowing what you really felt, rather that what you were supposed to feel, and had been taught to feel, was to put down what really happened in action; what the actual things which produced the emotion that you experienced.","If a writer stops observing he is finished. Experience is communicated by small details intimately observed.","I never had to choose a subject - my subject rather chose me.","Some other places were not so good but maybe we were not so good when we were in them.","Dying was nothing and he had no picture of it nor fear of it in his mind. But living was a field of grain blowing in the wind on the side of a hill. Living was a hawk in the sky. Living was an earthen jar of water in the dust of the threshing with the grain flailed out and the chaff blowing. Living was a horse between your legs and a carbine under one leg and a hill and a valley and a stream with trees along it and the far side of the valley and the hills beyond.","Creation\'s probably overrated. After all, God made the world in only six days and rested on the seventh.","The bicycle riders drank much wine, and were burned and browned by the sun. They did not take the race seriously except among themselves.","My life used to be full of everything. Now if you aren\'t with me I haven\'t a thing in the world.","What is moral is what you feel good after.","The great thing is to last and get your work done and see and hear and learn and understand; and write when there is something that you know; and not before, and not too damned much after.","I felt very lonely when they were all there.","Anyone can be a fisherman in May.","I drank a bottle of wine for company. It was Chateau Margaux. It was pleasant to be drinking slowly and to be tasting the wine and to be drinking alone. A bottle of wine was good company.","Do you know how an ugly woman feels?

It is bad luck for everybody that the percentages caught up with him. It is especially bad for Capa. (On Capa\'s death in Vietnam, May, 27, 1954)","A writer\'s problem does not change. He himself changes and the world he lives in changes but his problem remains the same. It is always how to write truly and having found what is true, to project it is such a way that it becomes a part of the experience of the person who reads it.","That every day should be a fiesta seemed to me a wonderful discovery.","Once writing has become your major vice and greatest pleasure only death can stop it. Financial security then is a great help as it keeps you from worrying.","A cat has absolute honesty.","You won\'t do our things with another girl, or say the same things, will you?","The best way is to read it all every day from the start, correcting as you go along, then go on from where you stopped the day before. When it gets so long that you can\'t do this every day read back two or three chapters each day; then each week read it all from the start. That\'s how you make it all of one piece.","You never understand anybody that loves you.","Religion is like an ice cold whiskey on a hot day.","The hardest thing to do is to write straight honest prose on human beings. First you have to know the subject; then you have to know how to write. Both take a lifetime to learn, and anybody is cheating who takes politics as a way out. All the outs are too easy, and the thing itself is too hard to do.","Often a man wishes to be alone and a girl wishes to be alone too and if they love each other they are jealous of that in each other, but I can truly say we never felt that. We could feel alone when we were together, alone against the others. But we were never lonely and never afraid when we were together.","It\'s none of their business that you have to learn how to write. Let them think you were born that way.","All good books are alike in that they are truer than if they really happened and after you are finished reading one you feel that it all happened to you and after which it all belongs to you.","I was young and not gloomy and there were always strange and comic things that happened in the worst time.","The sea is the same as it has been since before men ever went on it in boats.","There is no friend as loyal as a book.","One cat just leads to another.","No subject is terrible if the story is true, if the prose is clean and honest, and if it affirms courage and grace under pressure.","Oh, darling, you will be good to me, won\u2019t you? Because we\u2019re going to have a strange life.","Everyone has his own conscience,\\nand there should be no rules about\\nhow a conscience should function.","Work could cure almost anything","You love a lot of things if you live around them, but there isn\'t any woman and there isn\'t any horse, nor any before nor any after, that is as lovely as a great airplane.","You\'re not a moron. You\'re only a case of arrested development.","Cowards die a thousand deaths, but the brave only die once.","I had an inheritance from my father, It was the moon and the sun. And though I roam all over the world, The spending of it\u2019s never done.","Why should anybody be interested in some old man who was a failure?","The echoes of beauty you\'ve seen transpire, Resound through dying coals of a campfire.","In Africa a thing is true at first light and a lie by noon and you have no more respect for it than for the lovely, perfect wood-fringed lake you see across the sun-baked salt plain. You have walked across that plain in the morning and you know that no such lake is there. But now it is there absolutely true, beautiful and believable.","But Paris was a very old city and we were young and nothing was simple there.","Poor Faulkner. Does he really think big emotions come from big words? He thinks I don\u2019t know the ten-dollar words. I know them all right. But there are older and simpler and better words, and those are the ones I use.","I am opposed to writing about the private lives of living authors and psychoanalyzing them while they are alive. Criticism is getting all mixed up with a combination of the Junior FBI-men, discards from Freud and Jung and a sort of Columnist peep-hole and missing laundry list school. ... Every young English professor sees gold in them dirty sheets now. Imagine what they can do with the soiled sheets of four legal beds by the same writer and you can see why their tongues are slavering.","I have a rotten habit of picturing the bedroom scenes of my friends.","It is silly not to hope, besides I believe it is a sin.\\" The Old Man and the Sea","Once writing has become your major vice and greatest pleasure only death can stop it.","All you need to do is write truly and not care about what the fate of it is.","If the reader prefers, this book may be regarded as fiction. But there is always the chance that such a book of fiction may throw some light on what has been written as fact.","The people that I liked and had not met went to the big cafes because they were lost in them and no one noticed them and they could be alone in them and be together.","People fall in love, but have to climb out.","Oh, now, now, now, the only now, and above all now, and there is no other now but thou now and now is thy prophet.","The things of the night cannot be explained in the day, because they do not then exist.","I don\u2019t. I don\u2019t want anybody else to touch you. I\u2019m silly. I get furious if they touch you.","A cat has absolute emotional honesty: human beings, for one reason or another, may hide their feelings, but a cat does not.","I\'m not advocating the strenuous life for everyone or trying to say it\'s the choice form of life. Anyone who\'s had the luck or misfortune to be an athlete has to keep his body in shape. The body and mind are closely coordinated. Fattening of the body can lead to fattening of the mind. I would be tempted to say that it can lead to fattening of the soul, but I don\'t know anything about the soul.","Every day is a new day. It is better to be lucky. But I would rather be exact. Then when luck comes you are ready.","I write description in longhand because that\'s hardest for me and you\'re closer to the paper when you work by hand, but I use the typewriter for dialogue because people speak like a typewriter works.","Never mistake motive for action.","[Never give up hope. Never give in to pessimism. Never despair.] No horse named Morbid ever won a race!","Love is infinitely more endurable than hate.","If you stop complaining and asking for what you never will get, you will have a good life. A good life is not measured by any biblical span.","Nobody ever lives their life all the way up except bullfighters.","All stories, if continued far enough, end in death.","I\'m not going to get into the ring with Tolstoy.","Drinking is a way of ending the day.","Do not worry. You have always written before and you will write now.","For luck you carried a horse chestnut and a rabbit?s foot in your right pocket. The fur had been worn off the rabbit?s foot long ago and the bones and the sinews were polished by the wear. The claws scratched in the lining of your pocket and you knew your luck was still there.","The cat has complete emotional honesty - an attribute not often found in humans.","But Paris was a very old city and we were young and nothing was simple there, not even poverty, nor sudden money, nor the moonlight, nor right and wrong nor the breathing of someone who lay beside you in the moonlight.","The best ammunition against lies is the truth, there is no ammunition against gossip. It is like a fog and the clear wind blows it away and the sun burns it off.","All the critics who could not make their reputations by discovering you are hoping to make them by predicting hopefully your approaching impotence, failure and general drying up of natural juices. Not a one will wish you luck or hope that you will keep on writing unless you have political affiliations in which case these will rally around and speak of you and Homer, Balzac, Zola and Link Steffens.","We in America should see that no man is ever given, no matter how gradually or how noble and excellent the man, the power to put this country into a war which is now being prepared and brought closer each day with all the pre-meditation of a long planned murder. For when you give power to an executive you do not know who will be filling that position when the time of crisis comes.","The hard part about writing a novel is finishing it.","You see I\'m trying in all my stories to get the feeling of the actual life across, not just to depict life, or criticize it, but to actually make it alive.","Nobody climbs on skis now and almost everybody breaks their legs but maybe it is easier in the end to break your legs than to break your heart although they say that everything breaks now and that sometimes, afterwards, many are stronger at the broken places.","War is not won by victory.","I am so in love with you that there isn\u2019t anything else.","Don\'t you like to write letters? I do because it\'s such a swell way to keep from working and yet feel you\'ve done something.","I try not to borrow, first you borrow then you beg.","\'Safety\', the wife of Pablo said. \'There is no such thing as safety. There are so many seeking safety here now that they make a great danger. In seeking safety now you lose all.\'","I decided to stop drinking with creeps. I decided to drink only with friends. I\'ve lost 30 pounds.","If he wrote it, he could get rid of it. He had gotten rid of many things by writing them.","Wine is one of the most civilized things in the world and one of the most natural things of the world that has been brought to the greatest perfection, and it offers a greater range for enjoyment and appreciation than, possibly, any other purely sensory thing.","It is by riding a bicycle that you learn the contours of a country best, since you have to sweat up the hills and coast down them. Thus you remember them as they actually are, while in a motor car only a high hill impresses you, and you have no such accurate remembrance of the country you have driven through as you gain by riding a bicycle.","When writing a novel a writer should create living people; people not characters. A character is a caricature.","No Pilar,\\" Agustin said. \\"You are not smart. You are brave. You are loyal. You have decision. You have intuition. Much decision and much heart. But you are not smart.","Eschew the monumental. Shun the Epic. All the guys who can paint great big pictures can paint great small ones.","He\'s a great writer. If I didn\'t think so I wouldn\'t have tried to kill him... I was the champ and when I read his stuff I knew he had something. So I dropped a heavy glass skylight on his head at a drinking party. But you can\'t kill the guy. He\'s not human.","Don\'t get discouraged because there\'s a lot of mechanical work to writing. I rewrote the first part of Farewell to Arms at least fifty times.","There were many words that you could not stand to hear and finally only the names of places had dignity. Abstract words such as glory, honor, courage, or hallow were obscene.","How lazily the sun goes down in Granada, it hides beneath the water, it conceals in the Alhambra!","Madame, it is an old word and each one takes it new and wears it out himself. It is a word that fills with meaning as a bladder with air and the meaning goes out of it as quickly. It may be punctured as a bladder is punctured and patched and blown up again and if you have not had it does not exist for you. All people talk of it, but those who have had it are marked by it, and I would not wish to speak of it further since of all things it is the most ridiculous to talk of and only fools go through it many times.","I belong to this notebook and this pencil.","By then I knew that everything good and bad left an emptiness when it stopped. But if it was bad, the emptiness filled up by itself. If it was good you could only fill it by finding something better.","I may not be as stong as I think, but I know many tricks and I have resolution.","Anglers have a way of romanticizing their battles with fish and of forgetting that the fish has a hook in his mouth, his gullet, or his belly and that his gameness is really an extreme of panic in which he runs, leaps, and pulls to get away until he dies. It would seem to be enough advantage to the angler that the fish has the hook in his mouth rather than the angler.","An aggressive war is the great crime against everything good in the world. A defensive war, which must necessarily turn to aggressive at the earliest moment, is the necessary great counter-crime. But never think that war, no matter how necessary, nor how justified, is not a crime. Ask the infantry and ask the dead.","I don\'t like to leave anything,\' the man said. \'I don\'t like to leave things behind.","He could beat anything, he thought, because no thing could hurt him if he did not care.","If you are lucky enough to have lived in Paris as a young man, then wherever you go for the rest of your life it stays with you, for Paris is a moveable feast.","When I am working on a book or a story I write every morning as soon after first light as possible. There is no one to disturb you and it is cool or cold and you come to your work and warm as you write. . . .When you stop you are as empty, and at the same time never empty but filling, as when you have e made love to someone you love. Nothing can hurt you, nothing can happen, nothing means anything until the next day when you do it again. It is the wait until the next day that is hard to get through.","There is no rule on how to write. Sometimes it comes easily and perfectly; sometimes it\'s like drilling rock and then blasting it out with charges.","The ocean is worth writing about just as man is.","It\'s all nonsense. It\'s only nonsense. I\'m not afraid of the rain. I am not afraid of the rain. Oh, oh, God, I wish I wasn\'t.","But sometimes when I was starting a new story and I could not get it going, I would sit in front of the fire and squeeze the peel of the little oranges into the edge of the flame and watch the sputter of blue that they made. I would stand and look out over the roofs of Paris and think, \'Do not worry. You have always written before and you will write now. All you have to do is write one true sentence. Write the truest sentence that you know.\' So finally I would write one true sentence, and then go on from there.","My heart\'s broken,\' he thought. \'If I feel this way my heart must be broken.","There is no night life in Spain. They stay up late but they get up late. That is not night life. That is delaying the day. Night life is when you get up with a hangover in the morning. Night life is when everybody says what the hell and you do not remember who paid the bill. Night life goes round and round and you look at the wall to make it stop. Night life comes out of a bottle and goes into a jar. If you think how much are the drinks it is not night life.","The story was writing itself and I was having a hard time keeping up with it.","A man\'s got to take a lot of punishment to write a really funny book.","Cowardice, as distinguished from panic, is almost always simply a lack of ability to suspend the functioning of the imagination. Learning to suspend your imagination and live completely in the very second of the present with no before and no after is the greatest gift a soldier can acquire.","Never fall in love?\\" \\"Always,\\" said the count. \\"I am always in love.","In modern war... you will die like a dog for no good reason.","Keep right on lying to me. That\'s what I want you to do.","Any man who eats dessert is not drinking enough.","I don\'t think I ever owned twenty pencils at one time. Wearing down seven number-two pencils is a good day\'s work.","My writing is nothing, my boxing is everything.","We think. We are not peasants. We are mechanics. But even the peasants know better than to believe in a war. Everybody hates war. There is a class that control a country that is stupid and down not realise anything and never can. That is why we have this war. Also they make money out of it.","Until the dead are buried they change somewhat in appearance each day. The color change in Caucasian races is from white to yellow, to yellow-green, to black. If left long enough in the heat the flesh comes to resemble coal-tar, especially where it has been broken or torn, and it has quite a visible tarlike iridescence. The dead grow larger each day until sometimes they become quite too big for their uniforms, filling these until they seem blown tight enough to burst. The individual members may increase in girth to an unbelievable extent and faces fill as taut and globular as balloons.","To be a successful father... there\'s one absolute rule: when you have a kid, don\'t look at it for the first two years.","He no longer dreamed of storms, nor of women, nor of great occurrences, nor of great fish, nor fights, nor contests of strength, nor of his wife. He only dreamed of places now and the lions on the beach. They played like young cats in the dusk and he loved them as he loved the boy. He never dreamed about the boy. He simply woke, looked out the open door at the moon and unrolled his trousers and put them on.","As a Nobel Prize winner I cannot but regret that the award was never given to Mark Twain, nor to Henry James, speaking only of my own countrymen. Greater writers than these also did not receive the prize. I would have been happy - happier - today if the prize had been given to that beautiful writer Isak Dinesen.","I was always embarresed by the words \'sacred,\' \'glorious,\' and \'sacrifice\' and the expression \'in vain.\' We had heard them, sometimes standing in the rain almost out of earshot, so that only the shouted words came through, and had read them on proclamations that were slapped up by billposters over other proclamations, now for a long time, and I had seen nothing sacred, and the things that were glorious had no glory and the sacrifices were like the stock yards at Chicago if nothing was done with the meat except to bury it.","All things truly wicked start from innocence.","Once we have a war there is only one thing to do. It must be won. For defeat brings worse things than any that can ever happen in war.","He would lie in the bed and finally, with daylight, he would go to sleep. After all, he said to himself, it is probably only insomnia. Many must have it.","One cat just leads to another. The place is so damned big it doesn\'t really seem as though there were many cats until you see them all moving like a mass migration at feeding time.","Most people are heartless about turtles because a turtle\'s heart will beat for hours after he has been cut up and butchered. But the old man thought, I have such a heart too and my feet and hands are like theirs.","When spring came, even the false spring, there were no problems except where to be happiest.","I would walk along the quais when I had finished work or when I was trying to think something out. It was easier to think if I was walking and doing something or seeing people doing something that they understood.","I did not care what it was all about. All I wanted to know was how to live in it. Maybe if you found out how to live in it you learned from that what is was all about.","Dying is a very simple thing. I\'ve looked at death and really I know. If I should have died it would have been very easy for me. Quite the easiest thing I ever did. But the people at home do not realize that. They suffer a thousand times more.","Writing and travel broaden your ass if not your mind and I like to write standing up.","I would like to take the great DiMaggio fishing,\\" the old man said. \\"They say his father was a fisherman. Maybe he was as poor as we are and would understand.","For a long time now I have tried simply to write the best I can. Sometimes I have good luck and write better than I can.","There are events which are so great that if a writer has participated in them his obligation is to write truly rather than assume the presumption of altering them with invention.","Drinking wine was not a snobbism nor a sign of sophistication nor a cult; it was as natural as eating and to me as necessary.","Poor Faulkner. Does he really think big emotions come from big words?","Somebody just back of you while you are fishing is as bad as someone looking over your shoulder while you write a letter to your girl.","You must hold hard to life and do it. But life is a cheap thing beside a man\'s work. The only thing is that you need it. Hold it tight.","A severed femoral artery empties itself faster than you can believe.","The circus is the only fun you can buy that is good for you.","Everything that a painter did or that a writer wrote was a part of his training and preparation for what he was to do.","The telephone and visitors are the work destroyers.","We need more true mystery in our lives Hem- he said. The completely unambitious writer and the really good unpublished poem are the things we lack most. There is of course the problem of sustenance","Let\u2019s not talk about how I am. It\u2019s a subject I know too much about to want to think about anymore.","Before you quit, you have to try","When you go to war as a boy you have a great illusion of immortality. Other people get killed; not you. . . . Then when you are badly wounded the first time you lose that illusion and you know it can happen to you. After being severely wounded two weeks before my nineteenth birthday I had a bad time until I figured out that nothing could happen to me that had not happened to all men before me. Whatever I had to do men had always done. If they had done it then I could do it too and the best thing was not to worry about it.","French is the language of diplomacy. Spanish is the language of bureaucracy.","It was like certain dinners I remember from the war. There was much wine, an ignored tension, and a feeling of things coming that you could not prevent happening. Under the wine I lost the disgusted feeling and was happy. It seemed they were all such nice people.","The fools think I am writing algebra but what I am really writing is geometry.","Use short sentences. Use short first paragraphs. Use vigorous English. Be positive, not negative.","We all take a beating every day, you know, one way or another.","No one should be alone in their old age, he thought.","Enjoying living was learning to get your money\'s worth and knowing when you had it.","Got tight on absinthe last night. Did knife tricks.","You make your own luck, Gig. You know what makes a good loser? Practice.","He was just a coward and that was the worst luck any many could have.","No well-run yacht basin in Southern waters is complete without at least two sun-burned, salt bleached-headed Esthonians who are waiting for a check from their last article. When it comes they will set sail to another yacht basin and write another saga.","Night life is when everybody says what the hell and you do not remember who paid the bill.","We ate well and cheaply and drank well and cheaply and slept well and warm together and loved each other.","She is kind and very beautiful. But she can be so cruel and it comes so suddenly and such birds that fly, dipping and hunting, with their small sad voices are made too delicately for the sea.","If you have a success, you have it for the wrong reasons. If you become popular it is always because of the worst aspects of your work.","The brown blotches of the benevolent skin cancer the sun brings from its reflection on the tropic sea were on his cheeks. The blotches ran well down the sides of his face and his hands had the deep-creased scars from handling heavy fish on the cords. But none of these scars were fresh. They were as old as erosions in a fishless desert.","You don\'t have to destroy me. Do you? I\'m only a woman who loves you and wants to do what you want to do. I\'ve been destroyed two or three times already. You wouldn\'t want to destroy me again, would you?","The brave dies perhaps two thousand deaths if he\'s intelligent. He simply doesn\'t mention them.","I\'ve been wondering about Dostoyevsky. How can a man write so badly, so unbelievably badly, and make you feel so deeply?","Since I had started to break down all my writing and get rid of all facility and try to make instead of describe, writing had been wonderful to do.","They arrested us after breakfast.","And who understands? Not me, because if I did I would forgive it all.","God knows I didn\'t mean to fall in love with her","They were beaten to start with. They were beaten when they took them from their farms and put them in the army. That is why the peasant has wisdom, because he is defeated from the start. Put him in power and see how wise he is.","I read my own books sometimes to cheer me when it is hard to write, and then I remember that it was always difficult, and how nearly impossible it was sometimes.","Remember to get the weather in your damn book-weather is very important.","Organizations for writers palliate the writer\'s loneliness, but I doubt if they improve his writing.... For he does his work alone and if he is a good enough writer he must face eternity, or the lack of it, each day.","Wine is the most civilized thing in the world.","The world is a fine place and worth the fighting for and I hate very much to leave it.","When you start to live outside yourself, it\'s all dangerous.","I suppose if a man has something once, always something of it remains.","There are some things which cannot be learned quickly, and time, which is all we have, must be paid heavily for their acquiring.","The bulls are my best friends.\\" I translated to Brett. \\"You kill your friends?\\" she asked. \\"Always,\\" he said in English, and laughed. \\"So they don\'t kill me.","My attitude toward punctuation is that it ought to be as conventional as possible. The game of golf would lose a good deal if croquet mallets and billiard cues were allowed on the putting green. You ought to be able to show that you can do it a good deal better than anyone else with the regular tools before you have a license to bring in your own improvements.","I am glad we do not have to try to kill the stars.","But you always fall for somebody else and then it\'s all right.

Under the black hat, when I had first seen them, the eyes had been those of an unsuccessful rapist.","Everyone my age had written a novel and I was still having difficulty writing a paragraph.","There is nothing else than now. There is neither yesterday, certainly, nor is there any tomorrow. How old must you be before you know that? There is only now, and if now is only two days, then two days is your life and everything in it will be in proportion. This is how you live a life in two days. And if you stop complaining and asking for what you never will get, you will have a good life. A good life is not measured by any biblical span.","Everything that\'s innocent to us is crazy to them.","There is seven-eights of it under water for every part that shows. Anything you know you can eliminate and it only strengthens your iceberg. It is the part that doesn\'t show. If a writer omits something because he does not know it then there is a hole in the story.","If the book is good, is about something that you know, and is truly written, and reading it over you see that this is so, you can let the boys yip and the noise will have that pleasant sound coyotes make on a very cold night when they are out in the snow and you are in your own cabin that you have built or paid for with your work.","His (the writer\'s) standard of fidelity to the truth should be so high that his invention, out of his experience, should produce a truer account than anything factual can be.","Until you\'re grown-up they send you to reform school. After you\'re grown-up they send you to the penitentiary.","No horse named Morbid ever won a race.","Don\'t do what you sincerely don\'t want to do. Never confuse movement with action.","Let those who want to save the world if you can get to see it clear and as a whole. Then any part you make will represent the whole if it\'s made truly. The thing to do is work and learn to make it.","Bullfighting is the only art in which the artist is in danger of death and in which the degree of brilliance in the performance is left to the fighter\'s honor.","Survival, with honor, that outmoded and all-important word, is as difficult as ever and as all-important to a writer. Those who do not last are always more beloved since no one has to see them in their long, dull, unrelenting, no-quarter-given-and-no-quarter-received, fights that they make to do something as they believe it should be done before they die. Those who die or quit early and easy and with every good reason are preferred because they are understandable and human. Failure and well-disguised cowardice are more human and more beloved.","That terrible mood of depression of whether it\'s any good or not is what is known as The Artist\'s Reward.","No good book has ever been written that has in it symbols arrived at beforehand and stuck in. ... I tried to make a real old man, a real boy, a real sea and a real fish and real sharks. But if I made them good and true enough they would mean many things","That is what we are supposed to do when we are at our best - make it all up - but make it up so truly that later it will happen that way.","Prose is architecture, not interior decoration, and the Baroque is over.","it wasn\'t by accident that the Gettysburg address was so short.","All a man has is pride. Sometimes you have it so much it is a sin. We have all done things for pride that we knew were impossible. We didn\'t care. But a man must implement his pride with intelligence and care.","My big fish must be somewhere.","No weapon has ever settled a moral problem. It can impose a solution but it cannot guarantee it to be a just one.","You know you\u2019re writing well when you\'re throwing good stuff into the wastebasket.","Some people show evil as a great racehorse shows breeding. They have the dignity of a hard chancre.","I love you and I always will and I am sorry. What a useless word.","After writing a story I was always empty and both sad and happy, as though I had made love.","Il faut d\'abord durer (First One Must Endure).","You read what you have written and, as you always stop when you know what is going to happen next, you go on from there. You write until you come to a place where you still have your juice and know what will happen next and you stop and try to live through until the next day when you hit it again.","For a true writer each book should be a new beginning, where he tries again for something that is beyond attainment.","Always quit for the day when you know what you want to do next.","Got tight last night on absinthe and did knife tricks. Great success shooting the knife underhand into the piano. The woodworms are so bad and eat hell out of all the furniture that you can always claim the woodworms did it.","There isn\'t any me. I\'m you. Don\'t make up a separate me.","I was blown up while we were eating cheese.","I might say that what amateurs call a style is usually only the unavoidable awkwardnesses in first trying to make something that has not heretofore been made. Almost no new classics resemble other previous classics. At first people see only the awkwardness. Then they are not so perceptible. When they show so very awkwardly people think these awkwardnesses are the style and many copy them. This is regrettable.","Rush, that most exciting perversion of life, the necessity of accomplishing something in less time than should be truly allowed for its doing.","A writer should write what he has to say and not speak it.","I\'ve seen you, beauty, and you belong to me now, whoever you are waiting for and if I never see you again, I thought. You belong to me and all Paris belongs to me and I belong to this notebook and this pencil.","Before we take to the sea, we walk on land. . . Before we create, we must understand. . .","The time to work is shorter all the time and if you waste it you ... have committed a sin for which there is no forgiveness.","I am one of those who like to stay late at the cafe,\\" the older waiter said. \\"With all those who do not want to go to bed. With all those who need a light for the night.\\" \\"I want to go home and into bed.\\" \\"We are of two different kinds,\\" the older waiter said. He was now dressed to go home. \\"It is not only a question of youth and confidence although those things are very beautiful. Each night. I am reluctant to close up because there may be someone who needs the cafe.","There was no really good true war book during the entire four years of the war. The only true writing that came through during the war was in poetry. One reason for this is that poets are not arrested as quickly as prose writers.","To stay in places and to leave, to trust, to distrust, to no longer believe and believe again, . . . to watch the snow come, to watch it go, to hear rain on a tent, to know where I can find what I want.","You have it now and that is all your whole life is; now.  There is nothing else than now.  There is neither yesterday, certainly, nor is there any tomorrow.","This was a big storm and he might as well enjoy it. It was ruining everything, but you might as well enjoy it","Just as, with the radio, there are certain things that you become fond of,and you welcome them and resent the new things","What is the definition of guts?

And you\u2019re going to love it. It will crush you. And you\u2019re still going to love all of it.","The questioners had that beautiful detachment and devotion to stern justice of men dealing in death without being in any danger of it.","If a writer knows enough about what he is writing about, he may omit things that he knows. The dignity of movement of an iceberg is due to only one ninth of it being above water.","It\'s harder to write in the third person but the advantage is you move around better.","The world was not wheeling anymore. It was just very clear and bright and inclined to blur at the edges.","I started out very quiet and I beat Mr. Turgenev. Then I trained hard and I beat Mr. de Maupassant. I\'ve fought two draws with Mr. Stendhal, and I think I had an edge in the last one. But nobody\'s going to get me in any ring with Mr. Tolstoy unless I\'m crazy or I keep getting better.","The sinews of war are five - men, money, materials, maintenance (food) and morale.","It\'s a town you come to for a short time.","Good writing is good conversation, only more so.","His talent was as natural as the pattern that was made by the dust on a butterfly\'s wings. At one time he understood it no more than the butterfly did and he did not know when it was brushed or marred.","Madame, all stories, if continued far enough, end in death, and he is no true-story teller who would keep that from you.","Humility is not disgraceful, and carries no loss of true pride.","He had loved too much, demanded too much, and he wore it all out.","Sometimes you know the story. Sometimes you make it up as you go along and have no idea how it will come out.","Part of you died each year when the leaves fell from the trees and their branches were bare against the wind and the cold, wintry light.","When you give power to an executive you do not know who will be filling that position when the time of crisis comes.","Fortunately I have never learned to take the good advice I give myself nor the counsel of my fears.","The most beautiful fighting machine I have ever seen","Of all men the drunkard is the foulest. The thief when he is not stealing is like another. The extortioner does not practice in the home. The murderer when he is at home can wash his hands. But the drunkard stinks and vomits in this own bed and dissolves his organs in alcohol.","Wine is a grand thing,\\" I said. \\"It makes you forget all the bad.","Luck is a thing that comes in many forms and who can recognize her?","It is a miserable thing to have people writing about your private life while you are alive. I have tried to stop it all that I could but there have been many abuses by people I trusted. You cannot stop trusting people in life but I have learned to be a little bit careful. The way to make people trust-worthy is to trust them.","The house was built on the highest part of the narrow tongue of land between the harbor and the open sea. It had lasted through three hurricanes and it was built solid as a ship.","It wasn\'t by accident that the Gettysburg address was so short. The laws of prose writing are as immutable as those of flight, of mathematics, of physics.","Bigotry is an odd thing. To be bigoted you have to be absolutely sure you are right and nothing makes that surety and righteousness like continence. Continence is the foe of heresy.","Fish,\\" he said, \\"I love you and respect you very much. But I will kill you dead before this day ends.","I loved her and I loved no one else and we had a lovely magic time while we were alone. I worked well and we made great trips, and I thought we were invulnerable again, and it wasn\'t until we were out of the mountains in late spring, and back in Paris, that the other thing started again.","The parody is the last refuge of the frustrated writer. Parodies are what you write when you are associate editor of the Harvard Lampoon. The greater the work of literature, the easier the parody. The step up from writing parodies is writing on the wall above the urinal.","The road to Hell is paved with unbought stuffed dogs.","Write the best story that you can and write it as straight as you can.","Here is the piece. If you can\'t say fornicate can you say copulate or if not that can you say co-habit? If not that would have to say consummate I suppose. Use your own good taste and judgment.","All good books have one thing in common - they are truer than if they had really happened.","It is impossible to believe the emotional and spiritual intensity and pure, classic beauty that can be produced by a man, an animal, and a piece of scarlet serge draped over a stick.","We who have seen him now, light on his feet, smooth moving as a leopard, a young man with an old man\'s science, the most beautiful fighting machine I have ever seen, may live to see him fat, slow, old, and bald taking a beating from a younger man. But I would like to hazard a prediction that whoever beats Joe Louis in an honest fight in the next fifteen years will have to get up the floor to do it.","Nobody that ever left their own country ever wrote anything worth printing. Not even in the newspapers.","And we could have all this,\' she said. \'And we could have everything and every day we make it more impossible.\' \'What did you say?\' \'I said we could have everything.\' \'We can have everything.\' \'No, we can\'t.\' \'We can have the whole world.\' \'No, we can\'t.\' \'We can go everywhere.\' \'No, we can\'t. It isn\'t ours anymore.\' \'It\'s ours.\' \'No, it isn\'t. And once they take it away, you never get it back.","Defense is the stronger form with the negative object, and attack the weaker form with the positive object.","A writer should be of as great probity and honesty as a priest of God. He is either honest or not, as a woman is either chaste or not, and after one piece of dishonest writing he is never the same again.","I was as afraid as the next man in my time and maybe more so. But with the years, fear had come to be regarded as a form of stupidity to be classed with overdrafts, acquiring a venereal disease or eating candies. Fear is a child\'s vice and while I loved to feel it approach, as one does with any vice, it was not for grown men and the only thing to be afraid of was the presence of true and imminent danger in a form that you should be aware of and not be a fool if you were responsible for others.","I wonder what your idea of heaven would be \u2014 A beautiful vacuum filled with wealthy monogamists. All powerful and members of the best families all drinking themselves to death. And hell would probably an ugly vacuum full of poor polygamists unable to obtain booze or with chronic stomach disorders that they called secret sorrows.","How do you tell a valuable French book?\' \'First there are the pictures. Then it is a question of the quality of the pictures. Then it is the binding. If a book is good, the owner will have it bound properly. All books in English are bound, but bound badly. There is no way of judging them.","He did not care for the lying at first. He hated it. Then later he had come to like it. It was part of being an insider but it was a very corrupting business.","It is very bad for (an artist) to talk about how he (creates). It is not the (artist\'s) province to explain or to run guided tours through the more difficult country of his work. It\'s none of their business that you had to learn. Let them think you were born that way.","Now Catherine would die. That was what you did. You died. You did not know what it was about. You never had time to learn. They threw you in and told you the rules and the first time they caught you off base they killed you. Or they killed you gratuitously like Aymo. Or gave you the syphilis like Rinaldi. But they killed you in the end. You could count on that. Stay around and they would kill you.","The way to learn whether a person is trustworthy is to trust him.","The fact that I am interrupting serious work to answer these questions proves that I am so stupid that I should be penalized severely. I will be. Don\'t worry.","Never write about a place until you\'re away from it, because that gives you perspective","The one who is doing his work and getting satisfaction from it is not the one the poverty bothers.","In company with people of your own trade you ordinarily speak of other writers\' books. The better the writers the less they will speak about what they have written themselves. Joyce was a very great writer and he would only explain what he was doing to jerks. Other writers that he respected were supposed to be able to know what he was doing by reading it.","Those who say they want to be writers, and aren\u2019t writing, don\u2019t.","A beautiful vacuum filled with wealthy monogamists, all powerful and members of the best families all drinking themselves to death.","The great artist when he comes, uses everything that has been discovered or known about his art up to that point, being able to accept or reject in a time so short it seems that the knowledge was born with him, rather than that he takes instantly what it takes the ordinary man a lifetime to know, and then the great artist goes beyond what has been done or known and makes something of his own.","I\'ve seen a lot of patriots and they all died just like anybody else if it hurt bad enough and once they were dead their patriotism was only good for legends; it was bad for their prose and made them write bad poetry. If you are going to be a great patriot i.e. loyal to any existing order of government (not one who wishes to destroy the existing for something better) you want to be killed early if your life and works won\'t stink.","You\'re an expatriate. You\'ve lost touch with the soil. You get precious. Fake European standards have ruined you. You drink yourself to death. You become obsessed by sex. You spend all your time talking, not working. You are an expatriate, see? You hang around cafTs.","Ezra was right half the time, and when he was wrong, he was so wrong you were never in any doubt about it.","I wish I could write well enough to write about aircraft. Faulkner did it very well in Pylon but you cannot do something someone else has done though you might have done it if they hadn\'t.","For a war to be just three conditions are necessary - public authority, just cause, right motive.","Now, being in Africa, I was hungry for more of it, the changes of the seasons, the rains with no need to travel, the discomforts that you paid to make it real, the names of the trees, of the small animals, and all the birds, to know the language and have time to be in it and to move slowly.","Everything you have is to give. Thou art a phenomenon of philosophy and an unfortunate man.","They can\'t yank a novelist like they can a pitcher. A novelist has to go the full nine, even if it kills him.","You know lots of criticism is written by characters who are very academic and think it is a sign you are worthless if you make jokes or kid or even clown. I wouldn\'t kid Our Lord if he was on the cross. But I would attempt a joke with him if I ran into him chasing the money changers out of the temple.","If people bring so much courage to this world the world has to kill them to break them, so of course it kills them. The world breaks every one and afterward many are strong at the broken places. But those that will not break it kills. It kills the very good and the very gentle and the very brave impartially. If you are none of these you can be sure it will kill you too but there will be no special hurry.","But in the meantime all the life you have or ever will have is today, tonight, tomorrow, today, tonight, tomorrow, over and over again (I hope).","It is one thing to be in the proximity of death, to know more or less what she is, and it is quite another thing to seek her.","To hell with the Church when it becomes a State and the hell with the State when it becomes a Church.","Why must all of the operations in life be performed without an anesthetic?","There\'s no one thing that\'s true. It\'s all true.","A writer without a sense of justice or injustice would be better off editing the yearbook for a school for exceptional children.","I might say that what amateurs call a style is usually only the unavoidable awkwardnesses in first trying to make something that has not heretofore been made.","You write a book like that you\'re fond of over the years, then you see that happen to it, it\'s like pissing in your father\'s beer.","I kissed her hard and held her tight and tried to open her lips; they were closed tight.","I don\'t want to be your friend, baby. I am your friend.","If a writer of prose knows enough about what he is writing about he may omit things that he knows and the reader, if the writer is writing truly enough, will have a feeling of those things as strongly as though the writer had stated them. The dignity of movement of an iceberg is due to only one-eighth of it being above water. A writer who omits things because he does not know them only makes hollow places in his writing.","The educated man is the man who can do something. The quality of his work marks the degree of his education.","Everything is on such a clear financial basis in France. It is the simplest country to live in. No one makes things complicated by becoming your friend for any obscure reason. If you want people to like you you have only to spend a little money. I spent a little money and the waiter liked me. He appreciated my valuable qualities. He would be glad to see me, and would want me at his table. It would be a sincere liking because it would have a sound basis. I was back in France.","The best way to become a writer is to go off and write.","How would that premise stand up if he examined it? That was probably why the Communists were always cracking down on Bohemiansism. When you were drunk or when you committed adultery you recognised your own personal fallability of that so mutable substitute for the apostles\' creed, the party line. Down with Bohemianism, the sin of Majakowski.","The fish is my friend too...I have never seen or heard of such a fish. But I must kill him. I am glad we do not have to try to kill the stars. Imagine if each day a man must try to kill the moon, he thought. The moon runs away. But imagine if a man each day should have to try to kill the sun? We were born lucky; he thought","Now a writer can make himself a nice career while he is alive by espousing a political cause, working for it, making a profession of believing in it, and if it wins he will be very well placed. All politics is a matter of working hard without reward, or with a living wage for a time, in the hope of booty later. A man can be a Fascist or a Communist and if his outfit gets in he can get to be an ambassador or have a million copies of his books printed by the Government or any of the other rewards the boys dream about.","We have come out of the time when obedience, the acceptance of discipline, intelligent courage and resolution were most important, into that more difficult time when it is a man\'s duty to understand his world rather than simply fight for it.","He saw the girl watching him and he smiled at her. It was an old smile that he had been using for fifty years, ever since he first smiled.","Life breaks us all but in the end we are stronger in the broken places.","In stating as fully as I could how things really were, it was often very difficult and I wrote awkwardly and the awkwardness is what they called my style. All mistakes and awkwardness are easy to see, and they called it style.","Read anything I write for the pleasure of reading it. Whatever else you find will be the measure of what you brought to the reading.","It\'s enough for you to do it once for a few men to remember you. But if you do it year after year, then many people remember you and they tell it to their children, and their children and grandchildren remember and, if it concerns books, they can read them. And if it\'s good enough, it will last as long as there are human beings.","Because we would not wear any clothes because it was so hot and the windows open and the swallows flying over the roofs of the houses and when it was dark afterward and you went to the window very small bats hunting over the houses and close down over the trees and we would drink capri and the door locked and it hot and only a sheet and the whole night and we would both love each other all night in the hot night in Milan. That was how it ought to be.","Do not think about sin, he thought. There are enough problems now without sin. Also I have no understanding of it.","So far, about morals, I know only that what is moral is what you feel good after and what is immoral is what you feel bad after.","It is good that we do not have to try to kill the sun or the moon or the stars. It is enough to live on the sea and kill our true brothers.","Writing is the clumsy attempt to find symbols for wordlessness.","There are many who do not know they are fascists but will find it out when the time comes.","As in no other form of lute or combat, the conditions are such; the winner takes nothing, neither his ease, nor his pleasure, nor any notion of glory, nor if he wins far enough, will he find anything within himself.","Some people, when they hear an echo, think they originated the sound.","Time is the least thing we have.","You ought to be ironical the minute you get out of bed. You ought to wake up with your mouth full of pity.","I always rewrite each day up to the point where I stopped. When it is all finished, naturally you go over it. You get another chance to correct and rewrite when someone else types it, and you see it clean in type. The last chance is in the proofs. You\'re grateful for these different chances.","For him it was a dark passage which led to nowhere, then to nowhere, then again to nowhere, once again to nowhere, always and forever to nowhere, heavy on the elbows in the earth to nowhere, dark, never any end to nowhere, hung on all time always to unknowing nowhere, this time and again for always to nowhere, now not to be borne once again always and to nowhere, now beyond all bearing up, up, up and into nowhere, suddenly, scaldingly, holdingly all nowhere gone and time absolutely still and they were both there, time having stopped and he felt the earth move out and away from under them.","In order to be a great writer a person must have a built-in, shockproof crap detector.","You can write anytime people will leave you alone and not interrupt you.","But don\'t try to find an untroublesome woman. She will dull out on you. What makes a woman good in bed makes it impossible for her to live alone.","Paris is so very beautiful that it satisfies something in you that is always hungry in America.","Though there is one part of writing that is solid and you do it no harm by talking about it, the other is fragile, and if you talk about it, the structure cracks and you have nothing.","And the ones who would not make war? Can they stop it?","Men cannot act before the camera in the presence of death.","Live it up so you can write it down.","I know war as few other men now living know it, and nothing to me is more revolting. I have long advocated its complete abolition, as its very destructiveness on both friend and foe has rendered it useless as a method of settling international disputes.","When I am working on a book or a story I write every morning as soon after first light as possible. There is no one to disturb you and is it is cool and you come to your work and warm as you write. You read what you have written and, as you always stop when you know what is going to happen next, you go on from there. You write until you come to a place where you still have your juice and know what will happen next and you stop and try to live through until the next day when you hit again.","If the wind rises it can push us against the flood when it comes.","A continent ages quickly once we come. The natives live in harmony with it. But the foreigner destroys, cuts down the trees, drains the water, so that the water supply is altered, and in a short time the soil, once the sod is turned under, is cropped out and, next, it starts to blow away as it has blown away in every old country and as I had seen it start to blow in Canada. The earth gets tired of being exploited.","This was the price you paid for sleeping together. This was the end of the trap. This was what people got for loving each other.","I am always in love.","When I saw her I was in love with her. Everything turned over inside of me. She looked toward the door, saw there was no one, then she sat on the side of the bed and leaned over and kissed me.","I love thee and thou art so lovely and so wonderful and so beautiful and it does such things to me to be with thee that I feel as though I wanted to die when I am loving thee.","Listen now. When people talk listen completely. Don\'t be thinking what you\'re going to say. Most people never listen. Nor do they observe.","He remembered poor Julian [actually F. Scott Fitzgerald] and his romantic awe of them and how he had started a story once that began, \\"The very rich are different from you and me.\\" And how someone had said to Julian, \\"Yes, they have more money.\\"","No writer who knows the great writers who did not receive the Prize can accept it other than with humility. There is no need to list these writers. Everyone here may make his own list according to his knowledge and his conscience.","Nobody knows what\'s in him until he tries to pull it out. If there\'s nothing, or very little, the shock can kill a man.","You never kill any one that you want to kill in a war, he said to himself.","It was a pleasant cafe, warm and clean and friendly, and I hung up my old water-proof on the coat rack to dry and put my worn and weathered felt hat on the rack above the bench and ordered a cafe au lait. The waiter brought it and I took out a notebook from the pocket of the coat and a pencil and started to write.","I never knew of a morning in Africa when I woke that I was not happy.","There is no lonelier man in death, except the suicide, than that man who has lived many years with a good wife and then outlived her. If two people love each other there can be no happy end to it.","Try and write straight English; never using slang except in dialogue and then only when unavoidable. Because all slang goes sour in a short time. I only use swear words, for example, that have lasted at least a thousand years for fear of getting stuff that will be simply timely and then go sour.","In the fall the war was always there but we did not go to it any more.","Pound\'s crazy. All poets are.... They have to be. You don\'t put a poet like Pound in the loony bin.","To make war all you need is intelligence. But to win you need talent and material.","Summer is a discouraging time to work - you don\'t feel death coming on the way it does in the fall when the boys really put pen to paper.","We thought of wine as something as healthy and normal as food and also as a great giver of happiness and well being and delight.","Hail nothing full of nothing, nothing is with thee.","I felt the death loneliness that comes at the end of every day that is wasted in your life.","Let him think is I am more man than I am and I will be so.","He knew he would not be afraid. Even if he ever was afraid he knew that he could do it anyway.","It was considered a virtue not to talk unnecessarily at sea.","Write as well as you can and finish what you start.","Each day of not writing, of comfort, of being that which he despised, dulled his ability and softened his will to work so that, finally, he did no work at all.","I mistrust all frank and simple people, especially when their stories hold together","There is no night life in Spain. They stay up late but they get up late. That is not night life. That is delaying the day.","Honor to a Spaniard, no matter how dishonest, is as real a thing as water, wine, or olive oil. There is honor among pickpockets and honor among whores. It is simply that the standards differ.","You make something from things that have happened and from things that exist and from all things that you know and all those you cannot know, and you make something through your invention that is truer than anything true and alive, and if you make it well enough, you give it immortality.","And you\'ll always love me won\'t you? Yes And the rain won\'t make any difference? No","When I have an idea, I turn down the flame, as if it were a little alcohol stove, as low as it will go. Then it explodes and that is my idea.","There is a mystery in all great writing and that mystery does not dissect out. It continues and is always valid.","But after I got them to leave and shut the door and turned off the light it wasn\'t any good. It was like saying good-by to a statue. After a while I went out and left the hospital and walked back to the hotel in the rain.","A writer is like a gypsy. He owes no allegiance to any government. If he is a good writer he will never like any government he lives under. His hand should be against it and its hand will always be against him.","And you treat me wonderfully and keep all your promises.","The game of golf would lose a great deal if croquet mallets and billiard cues were allowed on the putting green.","Isn\'t it pretty to think so.","Personal columnists are jackals and no jackal has been known to live on grass once he had learned about meat - no matter who killed the meat for him.","No catalogue of horrors ever kept men from war. Before the war you always think that it\'s not you that dies. But you will die, brother, if you go to it long enough.","What I learned constructive about women, not just ethics like never blame them if they pox you because somebody poxed them and lots of times they don\'t even know they have it \u2014 that\'s in the first reader for squares \u2014 is, no matter how they get, always think of them the way they were on the best day they ever had.","I\'ve tried to reduce profanity but I reduced so much profanity when writing the book that I\'m afraid not much could come out. Perhaps we will have to consider it simply as a profane book and hope that the next book will be less profane or perhaps more sacred.","It is awfully easy to be hard-boiled about everything in the daytime, but at night it is another thing.","The only kind of writing is rewriting.","Life is the best left hooker I ever saw, although some say it was Charlie White of Chicago","(World War I) was the most colossal, murderous, mismanaged butchery that has ever taken place on earth. Any writer who said otherwise lied, So the writers either wrote propaganda, shut up, or fought.","What did I know best that I had not written about\\n and Lost? What did I know about truly and care for the most?","When you have shot one bird flying you have shot all birds flying. They are all different and they fly in different ways but the sensation is the same and the last one is as good as the first.","Hombre, there are bodegas open all night long.","How little we know of what there is to know. I wish that I were going to live a long time instead of going to die today because I have learned much about life in these four days; more, I think than in all other time. I\'d like to be an old man to really know. I wonder if you keep on learning or if there is only a certain amount each man can understand. I thought I knew so many things that I know nothing of. I wish there was more time.","And bed, he thought. Bed is my friend. Just bed, he thought. Bed will be a great thing. It is easy when you are beaten, he thought. I never knew how easy it was. And what beat you, the thought.","It is a hell of a thing to be hungry in your own house.","Never mistake movement for action","I kept this to remind me of you trying to brush away the Villa Rossa from your teeth in the morning, swearing and eating aspirin and cursing harlots. Every time I see that glass I think of you trying to clean your conscience with a toothbrush.","Cheer up,\' I said. \'All countries look just like the moving pictures.","A serious writer is not to be confounded with a solemn writer. A serious writer may be a hawk or a buzzard or even a popinjay, but a solemn writer is always a bloody owl.","Always stop for the day while you still know what will happen next.","And if there is not any such thing as a long time, nor the rest of your lives, nor from now on, but there is only now, why then now is the thing to praise and I am very happy with it.","For a poet he threw a very accurate milk bottle.","Switzerland is a small, steep country, much more up and down than sideways, and is all stuck over with large brown hotels built on the cuckoo clock style of architecture.","To invent out of knowledge means to produce inventions that are true. Every man should have a built-in automatic crap detector operating inside him. It also should have a manual drill and a crank handle in case the machine breaks down. If you\'re going to write, you have to find out what\'s bad for you. Part of that you learn fast, and then you learn what\'s good for you.","And this was the price you paid for sleeping together.","Fish,\\" he said softly, aloud, \\"I\'ll stay with you until I am dead.","Only that which makes you feel bad after doing is immoral.","A writer can be compared to a well. There are as many kinds of wells as there are writers.

Do you have to kill me too?","When I had finished the book I knew that no matter what Scott did, nor how he behaved, I must know it was like a sickness and be of any help I could to him and try to be a good friend. He had many good, good friends, more than anyone I knew. But I enlisted as one more, whether I could be of any use to him or not. If he could write a book as fine as The Great Gatsby I was sure that he could write an even better one. I did not know Zelda yet, and so I did not know the terrible odds that were against him. But we were to find them out soon enough.","wonder what day god created the egg\' \'how should we know? we should not question. our stay on earth is not for long. let us rejoice and believe and give thanks\'. \'eat a egg","There is never any ending to Paris and the memory of each person who has lived in it differs from that of any other. We always returned to it no matter who we were or how it was changed or with what difficulties, or ease, it could be reached. Paris was always worth it and you received return for whatever you brought to it. But this is how Paris was in the early days when we were very poor and very happy.","Practice any faith you wish. Got a ball field up the island where you can practice. I\'ll give the Deity a fast one high and inside if he crowds the plate.","Now he was proving it again. Each time was a new time and he never thought about the past when he was doing it.","My father was a deeply sentimental man. And like all sentimental men, he was also very cruel.","You\'re awfully dark, brother,\\" he said. \\"You don\'t know how dark.","There is nothing you can do except try to write it the way that it was. So you must write each day better than you possibly can and use the sorrow that you have now to make you know how the early sorrow came. And you must always remember the things you believed because if you know them they will be there in the writing and you won\u2019t betray them. The writing is the only progress you make.","Thou wilt go now, rabbit. But I go with thee. As long as there is one of us there is both of us.","Clearly I miss Him, having been brought up in religion. But now a man must be responsible to himself.","Abstract words such as glory, honor, courage, or hallow were obscene beside the concrete names of villages, the numbers of roads, the names of rivers, the numbers of regiments and the dates.","You did not kill the fish only to keep alive and to sell for food, he thought. You killed him for pride and because you are a fisherman. You loved him when he was alive and you loved him after. If you love him, it is not a sin to kill him. Or is it more?","Have faith in the Yankees my son. Think of the great DiMaggio.","In those days, there was no money to buy books.","I would take anything I love and throw it off the highest cliff you ever saw and not wait to hear it bounce.","We\'re always lucky,\' I said and like a fool I did not knock on wood.","You know I don\'t love any one but you. You shouldn\'t mind because some one else loved me.","How simple the writing of literature would be if it were only necessary to write in another way what has been well written.

Certain numbers were the same way and certain dates and these with the names of the places were all you could say and have them mean anything.

Sometimes those who love her say bad things of her but they are always said as though she were a woman. Some of the younger fishermen, those who used buoys as floats for their lines and had motorboats, bought when the shark livers had brought much money, spoke of her as \'el mar\' which is masculine.They spoke of her as a contestant or a place or even an enemy. But the old man always thought of her as feminine and as something that gave or withheld great favours, and if she did wild or wicked things it was because she could not help them. The moon affects her as it does a woman, he thought.","The world is a fine place and worth fighting for and I hate very much to leave it.","I had an inheritance from my father,It was the moon and the sun.And though I roam all over the world,The spending of it\u2019s never done.","If my Valentine you won\'t be,I\'ll hang myself on your Christmas tree.","This is a good place,\\" he said.\\"There\'s a lot of liquor,\\" I agreed.","Love is just another dirty lie.

Love is all the dirty little tricks you taught me that you probably got out of some book. All right. I\'m through with you and I\'m through with love.","Do you suffer when you write? I don\'t at all.

We slept when we were tired and if we woke the other one woke too so one was not alone. Often a man wishes to be alone and a girl wishes to be alone too and if they love each other they are jealous of that in each other, but I can truly say we never felt that. We could feel alone when we were together, alone against the others ... But we were never lonely and never afraid when we were together. I know that the night is not the same as the day: that all things are different, that the things of the night cannot be explained in the day, because they do not then exist, and the night can be a dreadful time for lonely people once their loneliness has started. But with Catherine there was almost no difference in the night except that it was an even better time.

Sometimes the heavy cold rains would beat it back so that it would seem that it would never come and that you were losing a season out of your life. This was the only truly sad time in Paris because it was unnatural. You expected to be sad in the fall. Part of you died each year when the leaves fell from the trees and their branches were bare against the wind and the cold, wintry light. But you knew there would always be the spring, as you knew the river would flow again after it was frozen. When the cold rains kept on and killed the spring, it was as though a young person had died for no reason. In those days, though, the spring always came finally but it was frightening that it had nearly failed.","Drinking wine was not a snobbism nor a sign of sophistication nor a cult; it was as natural as eating and to me as necessary...","The man who has begun to live more seriously within begins to live more simply without","You\u2019ll ache.

If the two people were as solidly constructed as the beacon there would be little damage except to the birds. Those who attract people by their happiness and their performance are usually inexperienced. They do not know how not to be overrun and how to go away. They do not always learn about the good, the attractive, the charming, the soon-beloved, the generous, the understanding rich who have no bad qualities and who give each day the quality of a festival and who, when they have passed and taken the nourishment they needed, leave everything deader than the roots of any grass Attila\'s horses\' hooves have ever scoured.","I say that is wine,\\" Brett held up her glass. \\"We ought to toast something. \'Here\'s to royalty.\'\\"\\"This wine is too good for toast-drinking, my dear. you don\'t want to mix emotions up with a wine like that. you lose the taste.\\"Brett\'s glass was empty.","Prose is architecture, not interior decoration.","When writing a novel a writer should create living people; people not characters. A character is a caricature. If a writer can make people live there may be no great characters in his book, but it is possible that his book will remain as a whole; as an entity; as a novel. If the people the writer is making talk of old masters; of music; of modern painting; of letters; or of science then they should talk of those subjects in the novel. If they do not talk of these subjects and the writer makes them talk of them he is a faker, and if he talks about them himself to show how much he knows then he is showing off. No matter how good a phrase or a simile he may have if he puts it in where it is not absolutely necessary and irreplaceable he is spoiling his work for egotism. Prose is architecture, not interior decoration, and the Baroque is over. For a writer to put his own intellectual musings, which he might sell for a low price as essays, into the mouths of artificially constructed characters which are more remunerative when issued as people in a novel is good economics, perhaps, but does not make literature. People in a novel, not skillfully constructed characters, must be projected from the writer\u2019s assimilated experience, from his knowledge, from his head, from his heart and from all there is of him. If he ever has luck as well as seriousness and gets them out entire they will have more than one dimension and they will last a long time. A good writer should know as near everything as possible. Naturally he will not. A great enough writer seems to be born with knowledge. But he really is not; he has only been born with the ability to learn in a quicker ratio to the passage of time than other men and without conscious application, and with an intelligence to accept or reject what is already presented as knowledge. There are some things which cannot be learned quickly and time, which is all we have, must be paid heavily for their acquiring. They are the very simplest things and because it takes a man\u2019s life to know them the little new that each man gets from life is very costly and the only heritage he has to leave. Every novel which is truly written contributes to the total of knowledge which is there at the disposal of the next writer who comes, but the next writer must pay, always, a certain nominal percentage in experience to be able to understand and assimilate what is available as his birthright and what he must, in turn, take his departure from. If a writer of prose knows enough about what he is writing about he may omit things that he knows and the reader, if the writer is writing truly enough, will have a feeling of those things as strongly as though the writer had stated them. The dignity of movement of an ice-berg is due to only one-eighth of it being above water. A writer who omits things because he does not know them only makes hollow places in his writing. A writer who appreciates the seriousness of writing so little that he is anxious to make people see he is formally educated, cultured or well-bred is merely a popinjay. And this too remember; a serious writer is not to be confounded with a solemn writer. A serious writer may be a hawk or a buzzard or even a popinjay, but a solemn writer is always a bloody owl.","He remembered the time he had hooked one of a pair of marlin. The male fish always let the female fish feed first and the hooked fish, the female, made a wild, panic-stricken, despairing fight that soon exhausted her, and all the time the male had stayed with her, crossing the line and circling with her on the surface. He had stayed so close that the old man was afraid he would cut the line with his tail which was sharp as a scythe and almost of that size and shape. When the old man had gaffed her and clubbed her, holding the rapier bill with its sandpaper edge and clubbing her across the top of her head until her colour turned to a colour almost like the backing of mirrors, and then, with the boy\u2019s aid, hoisted her aboard, the male fish had stayed by the side of the boat. Then, while the old man was clearing the lines and preparing the harpoon, the male fish jumped high into the air beside the boat to see where the female was and then went down deep, his lavender wings, that were his pectoral fins, spread wide and all his wide lavender stripes showing. He was beautiful, the old man remembered, and he had stayed.","This is a hell of dull talk...How about some of that champagne?","Never, never tell them. Try and remember that.

If you went there the way you feel now it would be exactly the same. This is a good town. Why don\'t you start living your life in Paris?","Once in camp I put a log on a fire and it was full of ants. As it commenced to burn, the ants swarmed out and went first toward the center where the fire was; then turned back and ran toward the end. When there were enough on the end they fell off into the fire. Some got out, their bodies burnt and flattened, and went off not knowing where they were going. But most of them went toward the fire and then back toward the end and swarmed on the cool end and finally fell off into the fire. I remember thinking at the time that it was the end of the world and a splendid chance to be a messiah and lift the log off the fire and throw it out where the ants could get off onto the ground. But I did not do anything but throw a tin cup of water on the log, so that I would have the cup empty to put whiskey in before I added water to it. I think the cup of water on the burning log only steamed the ants.","There is no reason why because it is dark you should look at things differently from when it is light.","Writing, at its best, is a lonely life. Organizations for writers palliate the writer\'s loneliness but I doubt if they improve his writing. He grows in public stature as he sheds his loneliness and often his work deteriorates. For he does his work alone and if he is a good enough writer he must face eternity, or the lack of it, each day.","To be able to say: I loved this person, we had a hell of a nice time together, it\u2019s over but in a way it will never be over and I do know that I for sure loved this person, to be able to say that and mean it, that\u2019s rare, se\xf1or.

Then he was sorry for the great fish that had nothing to eat and his determination to kill him never relaxed in his sorrow for him. . . . There is no one worthy of eating him from the manner of his behavior and his great dignity. I do not understand these things, he thought. But it is good that we do not have to try to kill the sun or the moon or the stars.

In the first place, you had to be in love with a woman to have a basis of friendship. I had been having Brett for a friend. I had not been thinking about her side of it. I had been getting something for nothing. That only delayed the presentation of the bill. The bill always came. That was one of the swell things you could count on.I thought I had paid for everything. Not like the woman pays and pays and pays. No idea of retribution or punishment. Just exchange of values. You gave up something and got something else. Or you worked for something. You paid some way for everything that was any good. I paid my way into enough things that I liked, so that I had a good time. Either you paid by learning about them, or by experience, or by taking chances, or by money. Enjoying living was learning to get your money\u2019s worth. The world was a good place to buy in. It seemed like a fine philosophy. In five years, I though, it will seem just as silly as all the other fine philosophies I\u2019ve had.","But you knew there would always be the spring, as you knew the river would flow again after it was frozen.

You have no family but a brother who goes to battle tomorrow and you own nothing but the wind and the sun and an empty belly. The wind is small, he thought, and there is no sun. You have four grenades in your pocket but they are only good to throw away. You have a carbine on your back but it is only good to give away bullets. You have a message to give away. And you\'re full of crap that you can give to the earth, he grinned in the dark. You can anoint it also with urine. Everything you have is to give. Thou art a phenomenon of philosophy and an unfortunate man, he told himself and grinned again.","That in some way he could work the fat off his soul the way a fighter went into the mountains to work and train in order to burn it out of his body","But we were never lonely and never afraid when we were together. I know that the night is not the same as the day: that all things are different, that the things of the night cannot be explained in the day, because they do not then exist, and the night can be a dreadful time for lonely people once their loneliness has started. But with Catherine there was almost no difference in the night except that it was an even better time. If people bring so much courage to this world the world has to kill them to break them, so of course it kills them. The world breaks every one and afterward many are strong at the broken places. But those that will not break it kills. It kills the very good and the very gentle and the very brave impartially. If you are none of these you can be sure it will kill you too but there will be no special hurry.","Grace under pressure.","Blood is thicker than water,\\"The young man saidAs he knifed his friendFor a drooling old bitchAnd a house full of lies.","The great thing is to last and get your work done and see and hear and learn and understand; and write when there is something that you know; and not before; and not too damned much after. Let those who want to save the world if you can get to see it clear and as a whole. Then any part you make will represent the whole if it\'s made truly. The thing to do is work and learn to make it.","You felt, in spite of all bureaucracy and inefficiency and party strife something that was like the feeling you expected to have and did not have when you made your first communion. It was a feeling of consecration to a duty toward all of the oppressed of the world which would be as difficult and embarrasing to speak about as religious experience and yet it was as authentic as the feeling you had when you heard Bach, or stood in Chartres Cathedral or the Cathedral at Le\xf3n and saw the light coming through the great windows; or when you saw Mantegna and Greco and Brueghel in the Prado. It gave you a part in something that you could believe in wholly and completely and in which you felt an absolute brotherhood with the others who were engaged in it. It was something that you had never known before but that you had experienced now and you gave such importance to it and the reasons for it that you own death seemed of complete unimportance; only a thing to be avoided because it would interfere with the performance of your duty. But the best thing was that there was something you could do about this feeling and this necessity too. You could fight.","Strong in all the Broken Places","Start by writing the truest sentence you know","Finishing a good book is like leaving a good friend.","If something is wrong, fix it if you can. But train yourself not to worry. Worry never fixes anything.","For we have thought the longer thoughtsAnd gone the shorter way.And we have danced to devils\' tunes, Shivering home to pray;To serve one master in the night,Another in the day.","Do you always get so hungry when you make love?\u201cWhen you love somebody.\u201d","Don\'t let yourself slip and get any perfect characters... keep them people, people, people, and don\'t let them get to be symbols.","I never had to choose my subject- my subject rather chose me.","I think perhaps I can too.But I try not to borrow. First you borrow. Then you beg.","The world is a fine place and worth the fighting for and I hate very much to leave it. And you had a lot of luck, he told himself, to have had such a good life. You\'ve had just as good a life as grandfather\'s though not as long. You\'ve had as good a life as any because of these last days. You do not want to complain when you have been so lucky. I wish there was some way to pass on what I\'ve learned, though.","Here\'s a taxidermist\'s,\\" Bill said. \\"Want to buy anything?

Not my fault.","It is never hopeless. But sometimes I cannot hope. I try always to hope but sometimes I cannot.","He was too simple to wonder when he had attained humility. But he knew he had attained it and he knew it was not disgraceful and it carried no loss of true pride.","From things that have happened and from things as they exist and from all things that you know and all those you cannot know, you make something through your invention that is not a representation but a whole new thing truer than anything true and alive, and you make it alive, and if you make it well enough you give it immortality. That is why you write and for no other reason that you know of. But what about all the reasons that no one knows?","He had never quarreled much with this woman, while with the women that he loved he had quarreled so much they had finally, always, with the corrosion of the quarreling, killed what they had together. He had loved too much, demanded too much, and he wore it all out.","Brett was damned good-looking. She wore a slip-over jersey sweater and a tweed skirt, and her hair was brushed back like a boy\'s. She started all that. She was built with curves like the hull of a racing yacht, and you missed none of it with that wool jersey.","And we could have all this,\' she said. \'And we could have everything and every day we make it more impossible.\'\'What did you say?\'\'I said we could have everything.\'\'We can have everything.\'\'No, we can\'t.\'\'We can have the whole world.\'\'No, we can\'t.\'\'We can go everywhere.\'\'No, we can\'t.

And once they take it away, you never get it back.","He told me how he had first met her during the war and then lost her and won her back, and about their marriage and then about something tragic that had happened to them at St-Raphael about a year ago. This first version that he told me of Zelda . and a French naval aviator falling in love was truly a sad story and I believe it was a true story. Later he told me other versions of it as though trying them for use in a novel, but none was as sad as this first one and I always believed the first one, although any of them might have been true. They were better told each time; but they never hurt you the same way the first one did.","We think. We are not peasants. We are mechanics. But even the peasants know better than to believe in a war. Everybody hates war.There is a class that control a country that is stupid and down not realise anything and never can.

Don\u2019t be thinking what you\u2019re going to say. Most people never listen. Nor do they observe. You should be able to go into a room and when you come out know everything that you saw there and not only that. If that room gave you any feeling you should know exactly what it was that gave you that feeling.","It is by riding a bicycle that you learn the contours of a country best, since you have to sweat up the hills and coast down them. Thus you remember them as they actually are, while in a motor car only a high hill impresses you, and you have no such accurate remembrance of country you have driven through as you gain by riding a bicycle.","If you have to go away,\' she said,\'is it absolutely necessary to kill off everything you leave behind? I mean do you have to take away everything? ...","This too to remember. If a man writes clearly enough any one can see if he fakes. If he mystifies to avoid a straight statement, which is very different from breaking so-called rules of syntax or grammar to make an efffect which can be obtained in no other way, the writer takes a longer time to be known as a fake and other writers who are afflicted by the same necessity will praise him in their own defense. True mysticism should not be confused with incompetence in writing which seeks to mystify where there is no mystery but is really only the necessity to fake to cover lack of knowledge or the inability to state clearly. Mysticism implies a mystery and there are many mysteries; but incompetence is not one of them; nor is overwritten journalism made literature by the injection of a false epic qulaity. Remember this too: all bad writers are in love with the epic.","I\u2019ll tell every one in the world that you are the only one that matters.","don\'t ask me a lot of questions if you don\'t like the answers","Prose is architecture and the Baroque age is over.","Remember, everything is right until it\u2019s wrong.

If you don\'t finish, nothing is worth a damn","It is better to be lucky. But I would rather be exact. Then when luck comes you are ready.","Religion is the opium of the people. He believed that, that dyspeptic little joint-keeper. Yes, and music is the opium of the people. Old mount-to-the-head hadn\'t thought of that. And now economics is the opium of the people; along with patriotism the opium of the people in Italy and Germany. What about sexual intercourse; was that an opium of the people? Of some of the people. Of some of the best of the people. But drink was a sovereign opium of the people, oh, an excellent opium. Although some prefer the radio, another opium of the people, a cheap one he had just been using. Along with these went gambling, an opium of the people if there ever was one, one of the oldest. Ambition was another, an opium of the people along with a belief in any new form of government. What you wanted was the minimum of government, always less government. Liberty, what we believed in, now the name of a MacFadden publication. We believed in that although they had not found a new name for it yet. But what was the real one? What was the real, the actual, opium of the people? He knew it very well. It was gone just a little way around the corner in that well-lighted part of his mind that was there after two or more drinks in the evening; that he knew was there (it was not really there of course). What was it? He knew very well. What was it? Of course; bread was the opium of the people. Would he remember that and would it make sense in the daylight? Bread is the opium of the people.","I had gone to no place where the roads were frozen and hard as iron, where it was clear cold and dry and the snow was dry and powdery and hare-tracks in the snow and the peasants took off their hats and called you Lord and there was good hunting. I had gone to no such place but to the smoke of caf\xe9s and nights when the room whirled and you needed to look at the wall to make it stop, nights in bed, drunk, when you knew that that was all there was, and the strange excitement of waking and not knowing who it was with you, and the world all unreal in the dark and so exciting that you must resume again unknowing and not caring in the night, sure that this was all and all and all and not caring. Suddenly to care very much and to sleep to wake with it sometimes morning and all that had been there gone and everything sharp and hard and clear and sometimes a dispute about the cost. Sometimes still pleasant and fond and warm and breakfast and lunch. Sometimes all niceness gone and glad to get out on the street but always another day starting and then another night. I tried to tell about the night and the difference between the night and the day and how the night was better unless the day was very clean and cold and I could not tell it; as I cannot tell it now","Be patient, hand,\\" he said. \\"I do this for you.","You\u2019re beautiful.

Then I thought of her walking up the street and stepping into the car, as I had last seen her, and of course in a little while I felt like hell again. It is awfully easy to be hard-boiled about everything in the daytime, but at night is another thing.","The most essential gift for a good writer is a built-in, shock-proof, shit detector.

Now, looking out the tunnel of trees over the ravine at the sky with white clouds moving across in the wind, I loved the country so that I was happy as you are after you have been with a woman that you really love, when, empty, you feel it welling up again and there it is and you can never have it all and yet what there is, now, you can have, and you want more and more, to have, and be, and live in, to possess now again for always, for that long sudden-ended always; making time stand still, sometimes so very still that afterwards you wait to hear it move, and it is slow in starting. But you are not alone because if you have every really loved her happy and untragic, she loves you always; no matter whom she loves nor where she goes she loves you more.","To go to bed at night in Madrid marks you as a little queer.

A writer who appreciates the seriousness of writing so little that he is anxious to make people see he is formally educated, cultured or well-bred is merely a popinjay. And this too remember; a serious writer is not to be confounded with a solemn writer. A serious writer may be a hawk or a buzzard or even a popinjay, but a solemn writer is always a bloody owl.","I don\'t know who made the laws; But I know there ain\'t no law that you got to go hungry.","But, thank God, [the fish] are not as intelligent as we who kill them; although they are more noble and more able.","And that was the end of the beginning of that","I was trying to learn to write, commencing with the simplest things, and one of the simplest things of all and the most fundamental is violent death.","Every one needs to talk to some one,\\" the woman said. \\"Before we had religion and other nonsense.

And you were a genius and I was your whole life. I was your partner and your little black flower. Slop. Love is just another dirty lie. Love is ergoapiol pills to make me come around because you were afraid to have a baby. Love is quinine and quinine and quinine until I\'m deaf with it. Love is that aborting horror you took me to. Love is my insides all messed up. It\'s half catheters and half whirling douches. I know about love. Love always hangs up behind the bathroom door. It smells like lysol. To hell with love. Love is you making me happy and then going off to sleep with your mouth open while I lie awake all night afraid to say my prayers even because I know I have no right to say anymore. Love is all the dirty little tricks you taught me that you probably got out of some book. All right. I\'m through with you and I\'m through with love. Your kind of picknose love.

In the bed of the river there were pebbles and boulders, dry and white in the sun, and the water was clear and swiftly moving and blue in the channels. Troops went by the house and down the road and the dust they raised powdered the leaves of the trees. The trunks of the trees too were dusty and the leaves fell early that year and we saw the troops marching along the road and the dust rising and leaves, stirred by the breeze, falling and the soldiers marching and afterward the road bare and white except for the leaves.","Fuck literature.","I\'m going to stay with you.

I went there nearly every day for the C\xe9zannes and to see the Manets and the Monets and the other Impressionists that I had first come to know about in the Art Institute at Chicago. I was learning something from the painting of C\xe9zanne that made writing simple true sentences far from enough to make the stories have the dimensions that I was trying to put in them. I was learning very much from him but I was not articulate enough to explain it to anyone. Besides it was a secret. But if the light was gone in the Luxembourg I would walk up through the gardens and stop in at the studio apartment where Gertrude Stein lived at 27 rue de Fleurus.","Some websites accepted each quote we create","We never get anything.

In some ways men can be immortal.","This was the greatest gift that he had, the talent that fitted him for war; that ability not to ignore but to despise whatever bad ending there could be. This quality was destroyed by too much responsibility for others or the necessity of undertaking something ill planned or badly conceived. For in such things the bad ending, failure, could not be ignored. It was not simply a possibility of harm to one\'s self, which could be ignored. He knew he himself was nothing, and he knew death was nothing. He knew that truly, as truly as he knew anything. In the last few days he had learned that he himself, with another person, could be everything. But inside himself he knew that this was the exception. That we have had, he thought. In that I have been most fortunate. That was given to me, perhaps, because I never asked for it. That cannot be taken away nor lost.

He had whored the whole time and then, when that was over, and he had failed to kill his loneliness, but only made it worse, he had written her, the first one, the one who left him, a letter telling her how he had never been able to kill it . . . . How when he thought he saw her outside the Regence one time it made him go all faint and sick inside, and that he would follow a woman that looked like her in some way, along the Boulevard, afraid to see it was not she, afraid to lose the feeling it gave him. How every one he had slept with had only made him miss her more. How what she had done could never matter since he could never cure himself of loving her.","I heard them laugh. I turned off the light and tried to go to sleep. It was not necessary to read any more. I could shut my eyes without getting the wheeling sensation. But i could not sleep. There is no reason why because it is dark you should look at things differently from when it is light. The hell there isn\'t!I figured that all out once, and for six months I never slept with the electric light off. That was another bright idea. To hell with women, anyway. To hell with you, Brett Ashley.","To have come on all this new world of writing, with time to read in a city like Paris where there was a way of living well and working, no matter how poor you were, was like having a great treasure given to you. You could take your treasure with you when you traveled too, and in the mountains where we lived in Switzerland and Italy, until we found Schruns in the high valley in the Vorarlberg in Austria, there were always the books, so that you lived in the new world you had found, the snow and the forests and the glaciers and their winter problems and your high shelter in the Hotel Taube in the village in the day time, and at night you could live in the other wonderful world the Russian writers were giving you.","Half fish,\\" he said. \\"Fish that you were.

If you become popular it is always because of the worst aspects of your work.","I believe that all the people who stand to profit by a war and who help provoke it should be shot on the first day it starts by accredited representatives of the loyal citizens of their country who will fight it.","All things truly wicked start from innocence. So you live day by day and enjoy what you have and do not worry. You lie and hate it and it destroys you and every day is more dangerous, but you live day to day as in a war.","Besides, he thought, everything kills everything else in some way. Fishing kills me exactly as it keeps me alive.","I had drunk much wine and afterward coffee and Strega and I explained, winefully, how we did not do the things we wanted to do; we never did such things.","In truly good writing no matter how many times you read it you do not know how it is done.

It is the part that doesn\'t show. If a writer omits something because he does not know it then there is a hole in the story.(Interview with Paris Review, 1958)","I know that the night is not the same as the day: that all things are different, that the things of the night cannot be explained in the day, because they do not then exist, and the night can be a dreadful time for lonely people once their loneliness has started.","Now that the bad weather had come, we could leave Paris for a while for a place where this rain would be snow coming down through the pines and covering the road and the high hillsides and at an altitude where we would hear it creak as we walked home at night. Below Les Avants there was a chalet where the pension was wonderful and where we would be together and have our books and at night be warm in bed together with the windows open and the stars bright. That was where we could go.","The best sky was in Italy or Spain and in Northern Michigan in the fall","Look at the ugliness. Yet one has a feeling within one that blinds a man while he loves you. You, with that feeling, blind him, and blind yourself. Then, one day, for no reason, he sees you as ugly as you really are and he is not blind anymore and then you see yourself as ugly as he sees you and you lose your man and your feeling... After a while, when you are as ugly as I am, as ugly as women can be, then, as I say after a while the feeling, the idiotic feeling that you are beautiful, grows slowly in one again. It grows like a cabbage. And then, when the feeling is grown, another man sees you and thinks you are beautiful and it is all to do over.","Everything became quite unreal finally and it seemed as though nothing could have any consequences.","He said we were all cooked but we were all right as long as we did not know it. We were all cooked. The thing was not to recognize it. The last country to realize they were cooked would win the war.","You know you\u2019re writing well when you\u2019re throwing good stuff into the wastebasket.","Some made the long drop from the apartment or the office window; some took it quietly in two-car garages with the motor running; some used the native tradition of the Colt or Smith and Wesson; those well-constructed implements that end insomnia, terminate remorse, cure cancer, avoid bankruptcy, and blast an exit from intolerable positions by the pressure of a finger; those admirable American instruments so easily carried, so sure of effect, so well designed to end the American dream when it becomes a nightmare, their only drawback the mess they leave for relatives to clean up.","I was a little crazy.

I knew everything was all right and was going to turn out well in the end when she leaned forward and said to me, telling me her great secret, \'Ernest, don\'t you think Al Jolson is greater than Jesus?\'Nobody thought anything of it at the time. It was only Zelda\'s secret that she shared with me, as a hawk might share something with a man. But hawks do not share. Scott did not write anything any more that was good until after he knew that she was insane.","Well,\' Bill said, \'we might as well have another drink.\' \'Damned good idea,\' Mike said. \'One never gets anywhere by discussing finances.","I know now that there is no one thing is true\u2013it is all true.","No. The two kinds of fools we have in Russia,\\" karkov grinned and began. \\"First there is the winter fool.

Then he takes off his fur coat and shakes it and more snow falls from them, Then he takes off his fur hat and knocks it against the door. More snow falls from his fur hat. Then he stamps his boots again and advances into the room. Then you look at him and you see he is a fool.

But he knew he had attained it and he knew it was not disgraceful and it carried no loss of true pride.\u201d","He looked across the sea and knew how alone he was now. But he could see the prisms in the deep dark water and the line stretching ahead and the strange undulation of the calm. The clouds were building up now for the trade wind and he looked ahead and saw a flight of wild ducks etching themselves against the sky over the water, then blurring, then etching again and he knew no man was ever alone on the sea.","Good writing is true writing. If a man is making a story up it will be true in proportion to the amount of knowledge of life that he has and how conscientious he is; so that when he makes something up it is as it would truly be.","The war was a long way away. Maybe there wasn\'t any war. There was no war here. Then I realized it was over for me. But I did not have the feeling that it was really over. I had the feeling of a boy who thinks of what is happening at a certain hour at the schoolhouse from which he has played truant.","When I am working on a book or a story I write every morning as soon after first light as possible. There is no one to disturb you and it is cool or cold and you come to your work and warm as you write. You read what you have written and, as you always stop when you know what is going to happen next, you go on from there. You write until you come to a place where you still have your juice and know what will happen next and you stop and try to live through until the next day when you hit it again. You have started at six in the morning, say, and may go on until noon or be through before that. When you stop you are as empty, and at the same time never empty but filling, as when you have made love to someone you love. Nothing can hurt you, nothing can happen, nothing means anything until the next day when you do it again. It is the wait until the next day that is hard to get through.","I shouldn\u2019t have gone out so far, fish, he said. \u201cNeither for you nor for me.

The things that happened could only have happened during a fiesta. Everything became quite unreal finally and it seemed as though nothing could have any consequences. It seemed out of place to think of consequences during the fiesta. All during the fiesta you had the feeling even when it was quiet, that you had to shout any remark to make it heard.

The others twisted themselves like cork-screws, their elbows raised, and leaned against the flanks of the bull after his horns had passed, to give a faked look of danger. Afterward, all that was faked turned bad and gave an unpleasant feeling. Romero\u2019s bull-fighting gave real emotion, because he kept the absolute purity of line in his movements and always quietly and calmly let the horns pass him close each time. He did not have to emphasize their closeness. Brett saw how something that was beautiful done close to the bull was ridiculous if it were done a little way off. I told her how since the death of Joselito all the bull-fighters had been developing a technic that simulated this appearance of danger in order to give a fake emotional feeling, while the bull-fighter was really safe. Romero had the old thing, the holding of his purity of line through the maximum of exposure, while he dominated the bull by making him realize he was unattainable, while he prepared him for the killing.","We can\u2019t ever go back to old things or try and get the \u201cold kick out of something or find things the way we remembered them.

But now I look forward till when our son will be a lieutenant commander.","Do you feel better?\' he asked.\'I feel fine,\' she said. \'There\'s nothing wrong with me. I feel fine.","He held her close and hard and inside himself he said goodbye and then goodbye and goodbye.","But I could tell thee of other things, Ingl\xe9s, and do not doubt what thou simply cannot see nor cannot hear. Thou canst not hear what a dog hears. Nor canst thou smell what a dog smells. But already thou hast experienced a little of what can happen to man.","Out of all the things you could not have there were some that you could have and one of those was to know when you were happy and to enjoy all of it while it was there and it was good.","He is a great fish and I must convince him, he thought. I must never let him learn his strength nor what he could do if he made his run.","Did I know him? Did I love him? You ask me that? I knew him like you know nobody in the world, and I loved him like you love God.","Now we have done it. Now we really have done it.Yes, he thought. Now we have really done it. And when she went to sleep suddenly like a tired young girl and lay beside him lovely in the moonlight that showed the beautiful new strange line of her head as she slept on her side he leaned over and said to her but not aloud, \u201cI\u2019m with you. No matter what else you have in your head I\u2019m with you and I love you.\u201d","That\'s my town,\' Joaquin said. \'What a fine town, but how the buena gente, the good people of that town, have suffered in this war.\' Then, his face grave, \'There they shot my father. My mother. My brother-in-law and now my sister.\' \'What barbarians,\' Robert Jordan said. How many times had he heard this? How many times had he watched people say it with difficulty? How many times had he seen their eyes fill and their throats harden with the difficulty of saying my father, or my brother, or my mother, or my sister? He could not remember how many times he heard them mention their dead in this way. Nearly always they spoke as this boy did now; suddenly and apropos of the mention of the town and always you said, \'What barbarians.","For one person who likes Spain there are a dozen who prefer books on her.","Even if he was ever afraid he knew that he could do it anyway.","During our last year in the mountains new people came deep into our lives and nothing was ever the same again. The winter of the avalanches was like a happy and innocent winter in childhood compared to the next winter, a nightmare winter disguised as the greatest fun of all, and the murderous summer that was to follow. It was that year that the rich showed up.","However you make your living is where your talent lies","The Lord is my shepherdI shall not want him for longHe maketh me to lie down in green pasturesand there are no green pasturesHe leadeth me beside still watersand still waters run deep","There had been too much emotion, too much damage, too much of everything.","Don\'t you believe I love you? Don\'t know how I can make you believe. I didn\'t want to kiss you goodbye--that was the trouble--I wanted to kiss you goodnight. [\u2026] Of course I love you. I love you all the time. [\u2026] I\'d like to hold you and kiss you so that you wouldn\'t doubt whether I wanted to or not.","Then he was sorry for the great fish... How many people will he feed?.. But are they worthy to eat him? No, of course, not. There is no one worthy of eating him from the manner of his behavior and his great dignity.","Everything kills everything else in some way.","It came very fast and the sun went a dull yellow and then everything was gray and the sky was covered and the cloud came on down the mountain and suddenly we were in it and it was snow.","Be a damn fire eater now. He\'d seen it in the war work the same way. More of a change than any loss of virginity. Fear gone like an operation. Something else grew in its place. Main thing a man had. Made him into a man. Women knew it too. No bloody fear.","I never used to realize it, I guess. I try and play it along and just not make trouble for people. Probably I never would have had any trouble at all if I hadn\'t run into Brett when they shipped me to England. I suppose she only wanted what she couldn\'t have. Well, people were that way. To hell with people. The Catholic Church had an awfully good way of handling all that. Good advice, anyway. Not to think about it. Oh, it was swell advice. Try and take it sometime. Try and take it.","I hope I am not for the killing, Anselmo was thinking. I think that after the war there will have to be some great penance done for the killing. If we no longer have religion after the war then I think there must be some form of civic penance organized that all may be cleansed from the killing or else we will never have a true and human basis for living. The killing is necessary, I know, but still the doing of it is very bad for a man and I think that, after all this is over and we have won the war, there must be a penance of some kind for the cleansing of us all.","First you borrow, then you beg.","You can either buy clothes or buy pictures,\\" she said. \\"It\'s that simple. No one who is not very rich can do both. Pay no attention to your clothes and no attention at all to the mode, and buy your clothes for comfort and durability, and you will have the clothes money to buy pictures.","I thought she was probably a little crazy. It was all right if she was. I did not care what I was getting into.","Happiness is often presented as being very dull but, he thought, lying awake, that is because dull people are sometimes very happy and intelligent people can go around making themselves and everyone else miserable. He had never found happiness dull. It always seemed more exciting than any other thing and capable of as great intensity as sorrow to those people who were capable of having it. This may not be true but he had believed it to be true for a long time and this summer they had experienced happiness for a month now and, already, in the nights, he was lonely for it before it had ever gone away.","No, he thought, when everything you do, you do too long, and do too late, you can\'t expect to find the people still there. The people all are gone. The party\'s over and you are with your hostess now.I\'m getting as bored with dying as with everything else, he thought.","I was trying to write then and I found the greatest difficulty, aside from knowing truly what you really felt, rather than what you were supposed to feel, and had been taught to feel, was to put down what really happened in action; what the actual things were which produced the emotion that you experienced. In writing for a newspaper you told what happened and, with one trick and another, you communicated the emotion aided by the element of timeliness which gives a certain emotion to any account of something that has happened on that day; but the real thing, the sequence of motion and fact which made the emotion and which would be as valid in a year or in ten years or, with luck and if you stated it purely enough, always, was beyond me and I was working very hard to try to get it.","It was like certain dinners I remember from the war. There was much wine, an ignored tension, and a feeling of things coming that you could not prevent happening.","You have never heard me talk much. But an intelligent man is sometimes forced to be drunk to spend his time with fools.","None of it was important now. The wind blew it out of his head.","I always worked until I had something done and I always stopped when I knew what was going to happen next. That way I could be sure of going on the next day. But sometimes when I was starting a new story and I could not get it going, I would sit in front of the fire and squeeze the peel of the little oranges into the edge of the flame and watch the sputter of blue that they made. I would stand and look out over the roofs of paris and think, \'Do not worry. You have always written before and you will write now. All you have to do is write one true sentence. Write the truest sentence that you know.\' So finally I would write one true sentence, and then go on from there. It was easy then because there was always one true sentence that I knew or had seen or had heard someone say. If I started to write elaborately, or like someone introducing or presenting something, I found that I could cut that scrollwork or ornament out and throw it away and start with the first true simple declarative sentence I had written. Up in that room I decided that I would write one story about each thing that I knew about. I was trying to do this all the time I was writing, and it was good and severe discipline.","Hail Mary full of Grace the Lord is with thee. Blessed art thou among women and blessed is the fruit of thy womb, Jesus. Holy Mary, Mother of God, pray for us sinners now and at the hour of our death. Amen.\' Then he added, \'Blessed Virgin, pray for the death of this fish wonderful though he is.","If I do it you won\'t ever worry?\'\'I won\'t worry about that because it\'s perfectly simple.\'\\"Then I\'ll do it. Because I don\'t care about me.","You have to make it inside of yourself wherever you are.","For luck you carried a horse chestnut and a rabbit\u2019s foot in your right pocket. The fur had been worn off the rabbit\u2019s foot long ago and the bones and the sinews were polished by the wear. The claws scratched in the lining of your pocket and you knew your luck was still there.","You paid some way for everything that was any good. I paid my way into enough things that I liked, so that I had a good time. Either you paid by learning about them, or by experience, or by taking chances, or by money. Enjoying living was learning to get your money\u2019s worth. The world was a good place to buy in. It seemed like a fine philosophy. In five years, I though, it will seem just as silly as all the other fine philosophies I\u2019ve had.","You may not believe this. No one believes this, but it is true.","If you brought up Joyce twice, you would not be invited back.","So now do not worry, take what you have, and do your work and you will have a long life and a very merry one.","In the morning I walked down the Boulevard to the rue Soufflot for coffee and brioche. It was a fine morning. The horse-chestnut trees in the Luxembourg gardens were in bloom. There was the pleasant early-morning feeling of a hot day. I read the papers with the coffee and then smoked a cigarette. The flower-women were coming up from the market and arranging their daily stock. Students went by going up to the law school, or down to the Sorbonne. The Boulevard was busy with trams and people going to work.","He was completely detached from every thing except the story he was writing and he was living in it as he built it. The difficult parts he had dreaded he now faced one after another and as he did the people, the country, the days and the nights, and the weather were all there as he wrote. He went on working and he felt as tired as if he had spent the night crossing the broken volcanic desert and the sun had caught him and the others with the dry gray lakes still ahead. He could feel the weight of the heavy double-barreled rifle carried over his shoulder, his hand on the muzzle, and he tasted the pebble in his mouth. Across the shimmer of the dry lakes he could see the distant blue of the escarpment. Ahead of him there was no one, and behind was the long line of porters who knew that they had reached this point three hours too late.It was not him, of course, who had stood there that morning, nor had he even worn the patched corduroy jacket faded almost white now, the armpits rotted through by sweat, that he took off then and handed to his Kamba servant and brother who shared with him the guilt and knowledge of the delay, watching him smell the sour, vinegary smell and shake his head in disgust and then grin as he swung the jacket over his black shoulder holding it by the sleeves as they started off across the dry-baked gray, the gun muzzles in their right hands, the barrels balanced on their shoulders, the heavy stocks pointing back toward the line of porters.It was not him, but as he wrote it was and when someone read it, finally, it would be whoever read it and what they found when they should reach the escarpment, if they reached it, and he would make them reach its base by noon of that day; then whoever read it would find what there was there and have it always.","Heresy is the foe of countenance","Spanish girls make wonderful wives. I\'ve never had one so I know.","There is a lot of time between now and the fall term. There is a lot of time between now and the day after tomorrow if you want to put it that way ...","The writer\u2019s job is not to judge, but to seek to understand.","Wearing down seven number-two pencils is a good day\u2019s work.","There was so much to write. He had seen the world change; not just the events; although he had seen many of them and had watched the people, but he had seen the subtler change and he could remember how the people were at different times. He had been in it and he had watched it and it was his duty to write of it; but now he never would.","You wouldn\'t believe it. It\'s like a wonderful nightmare.","A girl came in the cafe and sat by herself at a table near the window. She was very pretty with a face fresh as a newly minted coin if they minted coins in smooth flesh with rain-freshened skin, and her hair was black as a crow\'s wing and cut sharply and diagonally across her cheek.I looked at her and she disturbed me and made me very excited. I wished I could put her in the story, or anywhere, but she had placed herself so she could watch the street and the entry and I knew she was waiting for someone. So I went on writing.","write hard & clear about what hurts.","Los buenos libros se parecen en que son m\xe1s ciertos que si hubiesen sucedido de verdad y en que, cuando terminas de leerlos, sientes que todo te sucedi\xf3 y despu\xe9s, que todo te pertenece: lo bueno y lo malo, el \xe9xtasis, el remordimiento y el dolor, la gente y los lugares y c\xf3mo estaba el tiempo.","Thou askest me to take things seriously? After what thou didst last night? When thou needest to kill a man and instead did what you did? You were supposed to kill one, not make one! When we have just seen the sky full of airplanes of a quantity to kill us back to our grandfathers and forward to all unborn grandsons including all cats, goats and bedbugs. Airplanes making a noise to curdle the milk in your mother\'s breasts as they pass over darkening the sky and roaring like lions and you ask me to take things seriously. I take them too seriously already.","I drank a bottle of wine for company. It was a Ch\xe2teau Margaux. It was pleasant to be drinking slowly and to be tasting the wine and to be drinking alone. A bottle of wine was good company.","It was not brilliant bull-fighting. It was only perfect bull-fighting.","The hell with my arm. You lose an arm you lose an arm. There\'s worse things than lose an arm. You\'ve got two arms and you\'ve got two of something else. And a man\'s still a man with one arm or with one of those. The hell with it,\' he says. . . .after a minute he says, \'I got those other two still.","The sail was patched with flour sacks and, furled, it looked like the flag of permanent defeat.","Robert Jordan saw them there on the slope, close to him now, and below he saw the road and the bridge and the long lines of vehicles below it. He was completely integrated now and he took a good long look at everything. Then he looked up at the sky. There were big white clouds in it. He touched the palm of his hand against the pine needles where he lay and he touched the bark of the pine trunk that he lay behind... He was waiting until the officer reached the sunlit place where the first trees of the pine forest joined the green slope of the meadow. He could feel his heart beating against the pine needle floor of the forest.","my family\'s going to eat as long as anybody eats. What they\'re trying to do is starve you Conchs out of here so they can burn down the shacks and put up apartments and make this a tourist town. That\'s what I hear. I hear they\'re buying up lots, and then after the poor people are starved out and gone somewhere else to starve some more they\'re going to come in and make it into a beauty spot for tourists.","I still need some more healthy rest in order to work at my best. My health is the main capital I have and I want to administer it intelligently.","We went down the stairs to the caf\xe9 on the ground floor. I had discovered that was the best way to get rid of friends. Once you had a drink all you had to say was: \u201cWell, I\u2019ve got to get back and get off some cables, and it was done. It is very important to discover graceful exits like that in the newspaper business, where it is such an important part of the ethics that you should never seem to be working.\u201d","Don\u2019t get discouraged because there\u2019s a lot of mechanical work to writing \u2026 I rewrote the first part of A Farewell to Arms at least fifty times\u2026.The first draft of anything is shit.","\u0641\u0642\u062f \u0627\u0644\u0623\u0645\u0644 \u062e\u0637\u064a\u0626\u0629","He wanted to write about country so it would be there like Cezanne had done it in a painting. You have to do it from inside yourself... You could do it if you wanted to fight for it. If you\'d lived right with your eyes.","What you have with Maria, whether it lasts just through today and a part of tomorrow, or whether it lasts for a long life is the most important thing that can happen to a human being. There will always be people who say it does not exist because they cannot have it. But I tell you it is true and that you have it and that you are lucky even if you die tomorrow.","He had only one thing to do and that was what he should think about and he must think it out clearly and take everything as it came along, and not worry. To worry was a bad as to be afraid. It simply made things more difficult.","If a four-letter man marries a five-letter woman, he was thinking, what number of letters would their children be?","I wish it had been a dream now and that I had never hooked the fish and was alone in bed on the newspapers.","My wife and I had called on Miss Stein, and she and the friend who lived with her had been very cordial and friendly and we had loved the big studio with the great paintings. I t was like one of the best rooms in the finest museum except there was a big fireplace and it was warm and comfortable and they gave you good things to eat and tea and natural distilled liqueurs made from purple plums, yellow plums or wild raspberries.Miss Stein was very big but not tall and was heavily built like a peasant woman. She had beautiful eyes and a strong German-Jewish face that also could have been Friulano and she reminded me of a northern I talian peasant woman with her clothes, her mobile face and her lovely, thick, alive immigrant hair which she wore put up in the same way she had probably worn it in college. She talked all the time and at first it was about people and places.Her companion had a very pleasant voice, was small, very dark, with her hair cut like Joan of Arc in the Boutet de Monvel illustrations and had a very hooked nose. She was working on a piece of needlepoint when we first met them and she worked on this and saw to the food and drink and talked to my wife. She made one conversation and listened to two and often interrupted the one she was not making. Afterwards she explained to me that she always talked to the wives. The wives, my wife and I felt, were tolerated. But we liked Miss Stein and her friend, although the friend was frightening. The paintings and the cakes and the eau-de-vie were truly wonderful. They seemed to like us too and treated us as though we were very good, well-mannered and promising children and I felt that they forgave us for being in love and being married - time would fix that - and when my wife invited them to tea, they accepted.","Every true story ends in death.","The one who is doing his work and getting satisfaction from it is not the one the poverty is hard on.","In that way they really were friends, understanding in their basic disagreement, trusting in their complete distrust and enjoying one another\u2019s company.","The priest was good but dull. The officers were not good but dull. The King was good but dull. The wine was bad but not dull.","The gypsies believe the bear to be a brother to man because he has the same body beneath his hide, because he drinks beer, because he enjoys music and because he likes to dance.","The two waiters inside the cafe knew that theo ld man was a little drunk, and while he was a good client they knew that if he became too drunk he would leave without paying, so they kept watch on him.Last week he tried to commit suicide,\\" one waiter said.Why?\\"He was in despair.\\"What about?\\"Nothing.\\"How do you know it was nothing.\\"He has plenty of money.","We ate well and cheaply and we drank well and cheaply and we slept well and warm together and loved each other.","You are killing me, fish, the old man thought. But you have a right to. Never have I seen a greater, or more beautiful, or a calmer or more noble thing than you, brother. Come on and kill me. I do not care who kills who.","I could not fail myself and die on a fish like this,\\" he said. \\"Now that I have him coming so beautifully, God help me endure. I\'ll say a hundred Our Fathers and a hundred Hail Marys. But I cannot say them now.\\"Consider them said, he thought. I\'ll say them later.","How did you go bankrupt? Bill asked. \u201cTwo ways,\u201d Mike said. \u201cGradually and then suddenly.\u201d","He missed the prayers but he thought it would be unfair and hypocritical to say them and he did not wish to ask any favors or for any different treatment than all the men were receiving.","Good.

Paris was never to be the same again although it was always Paris and you changed as it changed. We never went back to the Vorarlberg and neither did the rich.","He was not sure that there were any great moments. Things were not the same and now life only came in flashes. He had flashes of the old greatness with his bulls, but they were not of value because he had discounted them in advance when he had picked the bulls out for their safety, getting out of a motor and leaning on a fence, looking over at the herd on the ranch of his friend the bull-breeder. So he had two small, manageable bulls without much horns, and when he felt the greatness again coming, just a little of it through the pain that was always with him, it had been discounted and sold in advance, and it did not give him a good feeling. It was the greatness, but it did not make bull-fighting wonderful to him any more.","It\'s this way, see--when a writer first starts out, he gets a big kick from the stuff he does, and the reader doesn\'t get any;then, after a while, the writer gets a little kick and the reader gets a little kick; and finally, if the writer\'s any good, he doesn\'t get any kick at all and the reader gets everything.","Cojones: testicles; a valorous bull fighter is said to be plentifully equipped with these. In a cowardly bullfighter they are said to be absent.","Then, while the old man was clearing the lines and preparing the harpoon, the male fish jumped high into the air beside the boat to see where the female was and then went down deep, his lavender wings, that were his pectoral fins, spread wide and all his wide lavender stripes showing. He was beautiful, the old man remembered, and he had stayed.That was the saddest thing I ever saw with them, the old man thought.","Nobody likes to life anchors.","You paid some way for everything that was any good. I paid my way into enough things that I liked, so that I had a good time. Either you paid by learning about them, or by experience, or by taking chances, or by money.","Because she had done the best she could for many years back and the way they were together now was no one person\'s fault.","I knelt and started to pray and prayed for everybody I thought of, Brett and Mike and Bill and Robert Cohn and myself, and all the bull-fighters, separately for the ones I liked, and lumping all the rest, then I prayed for myself again, and while I was praying for myself I found I was getting sleepy, so I prayed that the bullfights would be good, and that it would be a fine fiesta, and that we would get some fishing. I wondered if there was anything else I might pray for, and I thought I would like to have some money, so I prayed that I would make a lot of money, and then I started to think how I would make it, and thinking of making money reminded me of the count, and I started wondering about where he was, and regretting I hadn\u2019t seen him since that night in Montmartre, and about something funny Brett told me about him, and as all the time I was kneeling with my forehead on the wood in front of me, and was thinking of myself as praying, I was a little ashamed, and regretted that I was such a rotten Catholic, but realized there was nothing I could do about it, at least for a while, and maybe never, but that anyway it was a grand religion, and I only wished I felt religious and maybe I would the next time; and then I was out in the hot sun on the steps of the cathedral, and the forefingers and the thumb of my right hand were still damp, and I felt them dry in the sun. The sunlight was hot and hard, and I crossed over beside some buildings, and walked back along side-streets to the hotel.","What did he fear? It was not fear or dread. It was a nothing that he knew too well. It was all a nothing and a man was nothing too.","If he had known how many men in history have had to use a hill to die on it would not have cheered him any for, in the moment he was passing through, men are not impressed by what has happened to the other men in similar circumstances any more than a widow of one day is helped by the knowledge that other loved husbands have died.","I dried my hands and took out my pocket-book from the inside of my tunic hanging on the wall. Rinaldi took the note, folded it without rising from the bed and slid it in his breeches pocket. He smiled, \\"I must make on Miss Barkley the impression of a man of sufficient wealth.

But you can bear anything, he thought.","I had gone...to the smoke of cafes and nights when the room whirled and you needed to look at the wall to make it stop, nights in bed, drunk, when you knew that that was all there was, and the strange excitement of waking and not knowing who it was with you, and the world all unreal in the dark and so exciting that you must resume again unknowing and not caring in the night, sure that this was all and all and all and not caring. Suddenly to care very much and to sleep to wake with it sometimes morning and all that had been there gone and everything sharp and hard and clear and sometimes a dispute about the cost. Sometimes still pleasant and fond and warm and breakfast and lunch. Sometimes all niceness gone and glad to get out on the street but always another day starting and then another night. I tried to tell about the night and the difference between the night and the day and how the night was better unless the day was very clean and cold and I could not tell it; as I cannot tell it now. But if you have had it you know.","That I am a foreigner is not my fault. I would rather have been born here.","We have to get used to the idea that at the most important crossroads in our life there are no signs.","The dead do not need to rise. They are a part of the earth now and the earth can never be conquered. For the earth endureth forever. It will outlive all systems of tyranny. Those who have entered it honorably, and no men ever entered earth more honorably than those who died in Spain, already have achieved immortality.","We were no longer, technically, children although in many ways I am quite sure that we were. Childish has become a term of contempt. \\"Don\'t be childish, darling.\\" \\"I hope to Christ I am. Don\'t be childish yourself.\\" It is possible to be grateful that no one that you would willingly associate with you say, \\"Be mature. Be well-balanced, be well-adjusted.\\" Africa, being as old as it is, makes all people except the professional invaders and spoilers into children. No one says to anyone in Africa, \\"Why don\'t you grow up?\\" . . . Men know that they are children in relation to the country and, as in armies, seniority and senility ride close together. But to have the heart of a child is not a disgrace. It is an honor. A man must comport himself as a man. . . . But it is never a reproach that he has kept a child\'s heart, a child\'s honesty and a child\'s freshness and nobility.","Don\'t bother with churches, government buildings or city squares, if you want to know about a culture, spend a night in its bars","How what she had done could never matter since he knew he could not cure himself of loving her","It\'s funny,\' I said. \'It\'s very funny. And it\'s a lot of fun, too, to be in love.\'\'Do you think so?\' her eyes looked flat again.\'I don\'t mean fun in that way.

It must have gone around another street. It went in pairs, on bicycles, and moved absolutely silently on the pavements.","He felt as though he were hailing a ship.","The setting of the sun is a difficult time for all fish.","I sometimes think my style is suggestive rather than direct. The reader must often use his imagination or lose the most subtle part of my thought.","But man is not made for defeat, he said. \u201cA man can be destroyed but not defeated.\u201d","I knew how severe I had been and how bad things had been. The one who is doing his work and getting satisfaction from it is not the one who poverty bothers.","He bowed at the dark, straightened, tossed his hat over his shoulder, and, carrying the muleta in his left hand and the sword in his right, walked out toward the bull.","Do you suppose it will always go on?\\"\\"No.\\"\\"What\'s to stop it?\\"It will crack somewhere.","I told the boy I was a strange old man, he said. \u201cNow is when I must prove it.\u201d The thousand times that he had proved it meant nothing. Now he was proving it again.\u201d","the world is a fine place, and worth fighting for","I love thee as I love all that we have fought for. I love thee as I love liberty and dignity and the rights of all men to work and not be hungry. I love thee as I love Madrid that we have defended and as I love all my comrades that have died. And many have died. Many. Many. Thou canst not think how many. But I love thee as I love what I love most in the world and Ilove thee more.","It would be better alone, anything is better alone but I don\'t think I can handle it alone.","He looked at his face carefully in the glass, put a big dab of lather on each cheek-bone. \\"It\'s an honest face. It\'s a face any woman would be safe with.\\"\\"She\'d never seen it.\\"\\"She should have. All women should see it. It\'s a face that ought to be thrown on every screen in the country. Every woman ought to be given a copy of this face as she leaves the altar. Mothers should tell their daughters about this face.","You did not have to like it because you understood it. He could beat anything, he thought, because no thing could hurt him if he did not care","So far, about morals, I know only that what is moral is what you feel good after and what is immoral is what you feel bad after and judged by these standards, which I do not defend, the bullfight is very normal to me because I feel very fine while it is going on and have a feeling of life and death and mortality and immortality, and after it is over I feel very sad but also very fine.","Why do they have to be such damned fanatics? We chased good and we will always fight. But I hope we are not fanatics.","Woman are a nuisance on Safari.","We are stronger in our broken places.","They are not sorrows, so much as terrible things.","Half a million dead wopsAnd he got a kick out of itThe son of a bitch.","I don\u2019t have to be proud of it.

And also you take all the love I have to give","I want to pull my hair back tight and smooth and make a big knot at the back that I can feel, she said. I want to have a kitty to sit on my lap and purr when I stroke her.","I wonder why he jumped, the old man thought. He jumped almost as though to show me how big he was. I know now, anyway, he thought. I wish I could show him what sort of man I am. But then he would see the cramped hand. Let him think I am more man than I am and I will be so. I wish I was the fish, he thought, with everything he has against only my will and my intelligence.","All supposed exterior signs of danger that a bull gives, such as pawing the ground, threatening with his horns, or bellowing are forms of bluffing. They are warnings given in order that combat may be avoided if possible. The truly brave bull gives no warning before he charges except the fixing of his eye on the enemy, the raising of the crest of muscle in his neck, the twitching of an ear, and, as he charges, the lifting of his tail.","He had destroyed his talent by not using it, by betrayals of himself and what he believed in, by drinking so much that he blunted the edge of his perceptions, by laziness, by sloth, and by snobbery, by pride and by prejudice, by hook and by crook. What was this? A catalogue of old books? What was his talent anyway? It was a talent all right but instead of using it, he had traded on it. It was never what he had done, but always what he could do.","Non sopporto il pensiero che la mia vita stia scorrendo via cos\xec in fretta e che io in realt\xe0 non la viva.","Now standing in one corner of a boxing ring with a .22 caliber Colt automatic pistol, shooting a bullet weighing only 40 grains and with a striking energy of 51 foot pounds at 25 feet from the muzzle, I will guarantee to kill either Gene Tunney or Joe Louis before they get to me from the opposite corner. This is the smallest caliber pistol cartridge made; but it is also one of the most accurate and easy to hit with, since the pistol has no recoil. I have killed many horses with it, cripples and bear baits, with a single shot, and what will kill a horse will kill a man. I have hit six dueling silhouettes in the head with it at regulation distance in five seconds. It was this type of pistol that Millen boys\u2019 colleague, Abe Faber, did all his killings with. Yet this same pistol bullet fired at point blank range will not dent a grizzly\u2019s skull, and to shoot a grizzly with a .22 caliber pistol would simply be one way of committing suicide","For we have been there in the books and out of the books\u2014and where we go, if we are any good, there you can go as we have been. A country, finally, erodes and the dust blows away, the people all die and none of them were of any importance permanently, except those who practised the arts,","I\u2019m fonder of you than anybody on earth. I couldn\u2019t tell you that in New York. It\u2019d mean I was a faggot. That was what the Civil War was about. Abraham Lincoln was a faggot. He was in love with General Grant. So was Jefferson Davis. Lincoln just freed the slaves on a bet.","He lay there and felt something and then her hand holding him and searching lower and he helped with his hands and then lay back in the dark and did not think at all and only felt the weight and the strangeness inside and she said, \u201cNow you can\u2019t tell who is who can you?\u201cNo.\u201d\u201cYou are changing,\u201d she said. \u201cOh you are.

I\u2019m going to make love to you forever.\u201d","I was born ugly. All my life I have been ugly. You, \'Ingl\xe9s\', who know nothing about women. Do you know how an ugly woman feels? Do you know what it is to be ugly all your life and inside to feel that you are beautiful?I would have made a good man, but I am all woman and all ugly. Yet many men have loved me and I have loved many men. It is curious. Listen, \'Ingl\xe9s\', this is interesting. Look at me, as ugly as I am. Look closely, Thou art not ugly.\\"\\"\'Qu\xe9 no?\' Don\'t lie to me. Or,\\" she laughed the deep laugh. \\"Has it begun to work with thee? No. That is a joke. No. Look at the ugliness. Yet one has a feeling within one that blinds a man while he loves you. You, with that feeling, blind him, and blind yourself. Then one day, for no reason, he sees you ugly as you really are and he is not blind any more and then you see yourself as ugly as he sees you and you lose your man and your feeling. Do you understand, guapa?","The cynical ones are the best companions. But the best of all are the cynical ones when they are still devout; or after; when having been devout, then cynical, they become devout again by cynicism.","It was not her fault that when he went to her he was already over","It must be most dangerous then to be a man. It is indeed, madame, and but few survive it","Then he began to pity the great fish that he had hooked. He is wonderful and strange and who knows how old he is, he thought. Never have I had such a strong fish nor one who acted so strangely. Perhaps he is too wise to jump. He could ruin me by jumping or by a wild rush. But perhaps he has been hooked many times before and he knows that this is how he should make his fight. He cannot know it is only one man against him, nor that it is an old man. But what a great fish he is and what will he bring in the market if the flesh is good. He took the bait like a male and he pulls like a male and his fight has no panic in it. I wonder if he has plans or if he is just as desperate as I am?","The old man\'s head was clear and good now and he was full of resolution but he had little hope. It was too good to last, he thought. He took one look at the great fish as he watched the shark close in.","You had to have these peasant leaders quickly in this sort of war and a real peasant leader might be a little too much like Pablo. You couldn\'t wait for the real Peasant Leader to arrive and he might have too many peasant characteristics when he did. So you had to manifacture one. At that, from what he had seen of Campesino, with his black beard, his thick negroid lips, and his feverish, staring eyes, he thought he might give almost as much trouble as a real peasant leader. The last time he had seen him he seemed to have gotten to believe his own publicity and think he was a peasant.","The only thing that could spoil a day was people and if you could keep from making engagements, each day had no limits. People were always the limiters of happiness except for the very few that were as good as spring itself.","Best of all he loved the fall the leaves yellow on the cottonwoods leaves floating on the trout streams and above the hills the high blue windless skies\u2026now he will be a part of them forever.","And we\'ll never love anyone else but each other.","If people bring so much courage to this world the world has to kill them to break them, so of course it kills them. The world breaks everyone and afterward many are strong at the broken places. But those that will not break it kills. It kills the very good and the very gentle and the very brave impartially. If you are none of these you can be sure it will kill you too but there will be no special hurry.","Then there was the smell of heather crushed and the roughness of the bent stalks under her head and the sun bright on her closed eyes and all his life he would remember the curve of her throat with her head pushed back into the heather roots and her lips that moved smally and by themselves and the fluttering of the lashes on the eyes tight closed against the sun and against everything, and for her everything was red, orange gold-red from the sun on the closed eyes, and it all was that color, all of it, the filling, the possessing, the having, all of that color, all in a blindness of that color. For him it was a dark passage which led to nowhere, then to nowhere, then again to nowhere, once again to nowhere, always and forever to nowhere, heavy on the elbows in the earth to nowhere, dark, never any end to nowhere, hung on all time always to unknowing nowhere, this time and again for always to nowhere, now not to be borne once again always and to nowhere, now beyond all bearing up, up, up and into nowhere, suddenly, scaldingly, holdingly all nowhere gone and time absolutely still and they were both there, time having stopped and he felt the earth move out and away from under them.","He said nothing.","My God, what would a man do with a woman like that except worship her?","everything kills everything else in some way. Fishing kills me exactly as it keeps me alive. The boy keeps me alive, he thought. I must not deceive myself too much.","Then I started to think in Lipp\u2019s about when I had first been able to write a story about losing everything. It was up in Cortina d\u2019Ampezzo when I had come back to join Hadley there after the spring skiing which I had to interrupt to go on assignment to Rhineland and the Ruhr. It was a very simple story called \u2018Out of Season\u2019 and I had omitted the real end of it which was that the old man hanged himself. This was omitted on my new theory that you could omit anything if you knew that you omitted and the omitted part would strengthen the story and make people feel something more than they understood.","After a while I went out and left the hospital and walked back to the hotel in the rain.","[Imagination] is the one thing beside honesty that a good writer must have. The more he learns from experience the more he can imagine. If he gets so he can imagine truly enough people will think that the things he relates all really happened and that he is just reporting.","I wish to marry her . . . But she has one drawback, her attitude is uncooperative.","all cowardice comes from not loving or not loving well, which is the same thing.","I\u2019m always reading books\u2014as many as there are. I ration myself on them so that I\u2019ll always be in supply.","Who do you suppose has it easier? Ones with religion or just taking it straight? It comforts them very much but we know there is no thing to fear. It is only missing it that\'s bad. Dying is only bad when it takes a long time and hurts so much that it humiliates you.","He had been contemptuous of those who wrecked. You did not have to like it because you understood it. He could beat anything, he thought, because no thing could hurt him if he did not care.All right. Now he would not care for death. One thing he had always dreaded was the pain. He could stand pain as well as any man, until it went on too long, and wore him out, but here he had something that had hurt frightfully and just when he had felt it breaking him, the pain had stopped.","It is the fault of the orders, which are too rigid. There is no allowance for a change in circumstance.","It was a wonderful meal at Michaud\u2019s after we got in; but when we had finished and there was no question of hunger any more the feeling that had been like hunger when we were on the bridge was still there when we caught the bus home. It was there when we came in the room and after we had gone to bed and made love in the dark, it was there. When I woke with the windows open and the moonlight on the roofs of the tall houses, it was there. I put my face away from the moonlight into the shadow but I could not sleep and lay awake thinking about it. We had both wakened twice in the night and my wife slept sweetly now with the moonlight on her face. I had to try to think it out and I was too stupid. Life had seemed so simple that morning when I had waked and found the false spring and heard the pipes of the man with the herd of goats and gone out bought the racing paper.But Paris was a very old city and we were young and nothing was simple there, not even poverty, nor sudden money, nor the moonlight, nor right and wrong nor the breathing of someone who lay beside you in the moonlight.","There was nothing to do about him. It was Easter Sunday and the Fascists were advancing toward the Ebro. It was a gray overcast day with a low ceiling so their planes were not up. That and the fact that cats know how to look after themselves was all the good luck that old man would ever have.","People who interfered in your life always did it for your own good and I figured it out finally that what they wanted was for you to conform completely and never differ from some accepted surface standard and then dissipate the way traveling salesmen would at a convention in every stupid and boring way there was. They knew nothing of our pleasures nor how much fun it was to be damned to ourselves and never would know nor could know. Our pleasures, which were those of being in love, were as simple and still as mysterious and complicated as a simple mathematical formula that can mean all happiness or can mean the end of the world. That is the sort of happiness you should not tinker with but nearly everyone you knew tried to adjust.","When she goes, he though. I\'ll have all I want. Not all I want but all there is","We slept when we were tired and if we woke the other one woke too so one was not alone. Often a man wishes to be alone and a girl wishes to be alone too and if they love each other they are jealous of that in each other, but I can truly say we never felt that. We could feel alone when we were together, alone against the others ... But we were never lonely and never afraid when we were together.","If you have plenty of money, want not to see but to have seen a bullfight and plan no matter whether you like it or not to leave after the first bull, buy a barrera seat so that someone who has never had enough money to sit in a barrera can make a quick rush from above and occupy your expensive seat as you go out taking your pre-conceived opinions with you.","I learned to understand C\xe9zanne much better and to see truly how he made landscapes when I was hungry. I used to wonder if he were hungry too when he painted; but I thought possibly it was only that he had forgotten to eat. It was one of those unsound but illuminating thoughts you have when you have been sleepless or hungry. Later I thought C\xe9zanne was probably hungry in a different way.","Don\'t think, old man,\\" he said aloud. \\"Sail on this course and take it when it comes.","Maera lay still, his head on his arms, his face in the sand. He felt warm and sticky from the bleeding. Each time he felt the horn coming. Sometimes the bull only bumped him with his head. Once the horn went all the way through him and he felt it go into the sand. Some one had the bull by the tail. They were swearing at him and flopping the cape in his face. Then the bull was gone. Some men picked Maera up and started to run with him toward the barriers through the gate out the passageway around under the grandstand to the infirmary. They laid Maera down on the cot and one of the men went out for the doctor. The others stood around. The doctor came running from the coral where he had been sewing up picador horses. He had to stop and wash his hands. There was a great shouting going on in the grandstand overhead. Maera felt everything getting larger and larger and then smaller and smaller. Then it got larger and larger and larger and then smaller and smaller. Then everything commenced to run faster and faster as when they speed up a cinematograph film. Then he was dead.","Yo no quer\xeda darte un beso de despedida ese era el problema . Quer\xeda darte un beso de buenas noches. Hay una gran diferencia","What do you want? Everything.

His standard of fidelity to the truth should be so high that his invention, out of his experience, should produce a truer account than anything factual can be. For facts can be observed badly; but when a good writer is creating something, he has time and scope to make an absolute truth.6","Then he began to pity the great fish that he had hooked. He is wonderful and strange and who knows how old he is, he thought.","A writer\'s style should be direct and personal, his imagery rich and earthy, and his words simple and vigorous.

In the high mountains above the tree line I remember following the track of a fox until I came in sight of him and watching him stand with his right forefoot raised and then go carefully to stop and then pounce, and the whiteness and the clutter of a ptarmigan bursting out of the snow and flying away and over the ridge.","It was necessary that I leave Schruns and go to New York to rearrange publishers. I did my business inNew York and when I got back to Paris I should have caught the first train from the Gare de 1\'Est that would take me down to Austria.

Then, too, he was sentimental, and, like most sentimental people, he was both cruel and abused. Also, he had much bad luck, and it was not all of it his own.

He was sorry for the birds, especially the small delicate dark terns that were always flying and looking and almost never finding, and he thought, the birds have a harder life than we do except for the robber birds and the heavy strong ones. Why did they make birds so delicate and fine as those sea swallows when the ocean can be so cruel? She is kind and very beautiful.

There are so many good ones to paint and if you paint as well as you really can and keep out of all other things and do that, it is the true thing. You can paint the sea better than anyone now if you will do it and not get mixed up in other things. Hang on good now to how you truly want to do it.

The coffee was bitter. Nick laughed. It made a good ending to the story. His mind was starting to work. He knew he could choke it because he was tired enough. He spilled the coffee out of the pot and shook the grounds loose into the fire. He lit a cigarette and went inside the tent. He took off his shoes and trousers, sitting on the blankets, rolled the shoes up inside the trousers for a pillow and got in between the blankets.Out through the front of the tent he watched the glow of the fire when the night wind blew on it. It was a quiet night. The swamp was perfectly quiet. Nick stretched under the blanket comfortably. A mosquito hummed close to his ear. Nick sat up and lit a match. The mosquito was on the canvas, over his head. Nick moved the match quickly up to it. The mosquito made a satisfactory hiss in the flame. The match went out. Nick lay down again under the blankets. He turned on his side and shut his eyes. He was sleepy. He felt sleep coming. He curled up under the blanket and went to sleep.","Below Les Avants there was a chalet where the pension was wonderful and we would be together and have our books and at night be warm in bed together with the windows open and the stars bright.","It was never what he had done,but always what he could do. And he had chosen to make his living with something else instead of a pen or a pencil","It was not so much that he lied as that there was no truth to tell.

I thought I had never seen any one so beautiful. \u2018Hello,\u2019 I said. When I saw her I was in love with her. Everything turned over inside of me","Like all men with a faculty that surpasses human requirements, his father was very nervous. Then, too, he was sentimental, and, like most sentimental people, he was both cruel and abused. Also, he had much bad luck, and it was not all of it his own. He had died in a trap that he had helped only a little to set, and they had all betrayed him in their various ways before he died.","She\'s vicious,\' Miss Stein said. \'She\'s truly vicious, so she can never be happy except with new people. She corrupts people.","That was morality; things that made you disgusted afterward. No, that must be immorality.","Then as I was getting up to the Closerie des Lilas with the light on my old friend, the statue of Marshal Ney with his sword out and the shadows of the trees on the bronze, and he alone there and nobody behind him and what a fiasco he\'d made of Waterloo, I thought that all generations were lost by something and always had been and always would be and I stopped at the Lilas to keep the statue company and drank a cold beer before going home to the flat over the sawmill.","When I was writing, it was necessary for me to read after I had written. If you kept thinking about it, you would lose the thing that you were writing before you could go on with it the next day. It was necessary to exercise, to be tired in the body, and it was very good to make love with whom you loved. That was better than anything. But afterwards, when you were empty, it was necessary to read in order to think or not worry about your work until you could do it again. I had learned already never to empty the well of my writing, but always to stop when there was still something there in the deep part of the well, and let it refill at night from the springs that fed it.","He smiled as only the truly shy can smile. It was not the easy grin of the confident, nor the quick slashing smile of the extremely durable and the wicked. It had no relation with the poised, intently used smile of the courtesan or the politician. It was the strange, rare smile which rises from the deep, dark pit, deeper than a well, deep as a mine, that is within them.","The hardest thing in the world to do is to write straight honest prose on human beings. First you to know the subject; then you have to know how to write. Both take a lifetime to learn...","Also, he had always had a great tolerance which seemed the nicest thing about him if it were not the most sinister.","We are very serious so we can make very strong jokes.","For many things are not as they appear. Discipline must come from trust and confidence.","The Age DemandThe age demanded that we singAnd cut away our tongue.The age demanded that we flowAnd hammered in the bung.The age demanded that we danceAnd jammed us into iron pants.And in the end the age was handedThe sort of shit that it demanded.","Writing is a hard business, but nothing makes you feel better","And feel now. Thou hast no heart but mine.","You could not go back. If you did not go forward what happened?","He was completely integrated now and he took a good long look at everything. Then he looked up at the sky. There were big white clouds in it. He touched the palm of his hand against the pine needles where he lay and he touched the bark of the pine trunk that he lay behind.","Let us not doubt, brother. Let us not pry into the holy mysteries of the hen-coop with simian fingers.","Wipe the pap of your mother\'s breast off thy lips and give me a hatful of that dirt,\' the man with his chin on the ground said. \'No one of us will see the sun go down this night.","Too much honor destroys a man quicker than too much of any other fine quality.","I do not think I have ever seen a nastier-looking man... Under the black hat, when I had first seen them, the eyes had been those of an unsuccessful rapist. [on Brit poet Percy Wyndham Lewis]","Nobody climbs on skis now and almost everybody breaks their legs but maybe it is easier in the end to break your legs than to break your heart although they say that everything breaks now and that sometimes, afterwards, many are stronger at the broken places. I do not know about that now but this is how Paris was in the early days when we were very poor and very happy.","In the snowstorm you came close to wild animals and they were not afraid. They travelled across country not knowing where they were and the deer stood sometimes in the lee of the cabin. In a snowstorm you rode up to a moose and he mistook your horse for another moose and trotted forward to meet you. In a snowstorm it always seemed, for a time, as though there were no enemies.","If you had stars inside your brain cells, you\'d probably understand what I am talking about.","Your nationality and your politics did not show when you were dead. Robert","The professor at the boxing gymnasium wore mustaches and was very precise and jerky and went all to pieces if you started after him.","To understand is to forgive. That\'s not true. Forgiveness has been exaggerated. Forgiveness is a Christian idea and Spain has never been a Christian country. It has always had its own special idol worship within the Church. \'Otra Virgen m\xe1s\'. I suppose that was why they had to destroy the virgins of their enemies. Surely it was deeper with them, with the Spanish religion fanatics, than it was with the people.

The man next to Bill was talking to him in Spanish and Bill was not getting it, so he offered the man one of the bottles of wine. The man waved it away. He said it was too hot and he had drunk too much at lunch. When Bill offered the bottle the second time he took a long drink, and then the bottle went all over that part of the bus. Every one took a drink very politely, and then they made us cork it up and put it away. They all wanted us to drink from their leather wine-bottles. They were peasants going up into the hills.","I suppose she only wanted what she couldn\u2019t have.

We could feel alone when we were together, alone against the others. It has only happened to me like that once. I have been alone while I was with many girls and that is the way that you can be most lonely. But we were never lonely and never afraid when we were together. I know that the night is not the same as the day: that all things are different, that the things of the night cannot be explained in the day, because they do not then exist, and the night can be a dreadful time for lonely people once their loneliness has started. But with Catherine there was almost no difference in the night except that it was an even better time. If people bring so much courage to this world the world has to kill them to break them, so of course it kills them. The world breaks every one and afterward many are strong at the broken places. But those that will not break it kills. It kills the very good and the very gentle and the very brave impartially. If you are none of these you can be sure it will kill you too but there will be no special hurry.","I would like to bear thy son and hy daughter,\\" she told hime. \\"And how can the world be made better if there are no children of us who fight against the fascists?","Fall for them, but don\'t let them ruin you.","My style might seem awkward, but I\'m only trying to write down the things in the scene that I think the reader should know.","The colonel breakfasted with the leisure of a fighter who has been clipped badly, hears four, and knows how to relax truly for five seconds or more.","Love is the wanting to do things for.","But walking down the stairs feeling each stair carefully and holding to the banister he thought, I must get her away and get her away as soon as I can without hurting her.

All must believe in the fight they are to make and all must accept discipline. - For Whom the Bell Tolls","It was in that room too that I learned not to think about anything that I was writing from the time I stopped writing until I started again the next day. That way my subconscious would be working on it and at the same time I would be listening to other people and noticing everything, I hoped; learning, I hoped; and I would read so that I would not think about my work and make myself impotent to do it. Going down the stairs when you had worked well, and that needed luck as well as discipline, was a wonderful feeling and I was free then to walk anywhere in Paris.","He sat on the logs, smoking, drying in the sun, the sun warm on his back the river shallow ahead entering the woods, curving into the woods, shallows light glittering, big water-smooth rocks, cedars along the bank and white birches, the logs warm in the sun, smooth to sit on, without bark, gray to the touch; slowly the feeling of disappointment left him.","The cat is the best anarchist.","I sleep on my face, and then it does not frighten anybody in the morning.","Su decisi\xf3n habia sido permanecer en aguas profundas y tenebrosas, lejos de todas las trampas y cebos y traiciones.

I wondered if there was anything else I might pray for, and I thought I would like to have some money, so I prayed that I would make a lot of money, and then I started to think how I would make it and thinking of making money reminded me of the count, and I started wondering about where he was, and regretting I hadn\'t seen him since that night in Montmartre, and about something funny Brett told me about him, and as all the time I was kneeling with my forehead on the wood in front of me, and was thinking of myself praying, I was a little ashamed, and regretted that I was such a rotten Catholic, but realized there was nothing I could do about it, at least for a while, and maybe never, but that anyway it was a grand religion, and I only wished I felt religious and maybe I would the next time; and then I was out in the hot sun on the steps of the cathedral, and the forefingers and the thumb of my right hand were still damp, and I felt them dry in the sun.","You\'ll lose it if you talk about it.","Scott took LITERATURE so solemnly.

If a writer of prose knows enough about what he is writing about he may omit things that he knows and the reader, if the writer is writing truly enough, will have a feeling of those things as strongly as though the writer had stated them. The dignity of movement of an ice-berg is due to only one-eighth of it being above water. A writer who omits things because he does not know them only makes hollow places in his writing. A writer who appreciates the seriousness of writing so little that he is anxious to make people see he is formally educated, cultured or well-bred is merely a popinjay. And this too remember; a serious writer is not to be confounded with a solemn writer. A serious writer may be a hawk or a buzzard or even a popinjay, but a solemn writer is always a bloody owl.","By then I knew that everything good and bad left an emptiness when it stopped.

If he mystifies to avoid a straight statement, which is very different from breaking so-called rules of syntax or grammar to make an effect which can be obtained in no other way, the writer takes a longer time to be known as a fake and other writers who are afflicted by the same necessity will praise him in their own defense. True mysticism should not be confused with incompetence in writing which seeks to mystify where there is no mystery but is really only the necessity to fake to cover lack of knowledge or the inability to state clearly. Mysticism implies a mystery and there are many mysteries; but incompetence is not one of them; nor is overwritten journalism made literature by the injection of a false epic quality. Remember this too: all bad writers are in love with the epic.","Dizem que as sementes daquilo que havemos de realizar se encontram j\xe1 todas dentro de n\xf3s, mas sempre me pareceu que, naqueles que tro\xe7am da vida, as sementes se encontram cobertas de melhor terra e de uma percentagem mais alta de adubo.","If a writer of prose knows enough about what he is writing about he may omit things that he knows and the reader, if the writer is writing truly enough, will have a feeling of those things as strongly as though the writer had stated them.

A writer who appreciates the seriousness of writing so little that he is anxious to make people see he is formally educated, cultured or well-bred is merely a popinjay. A serious writer may be a hawk or a buzzard or even a popinjay, but a solemn writer is always a bloody owl.","\xdclkeyi y\xf6neten bir s\u0131n\u0131f var, ak\u0131ls\u0131z bir s\u0131n\u0131f.

They spoke of her as a contestant or a place or even an enemy. But the old man always thought of her as feminine and as something that gave or withheld great favours, and if she did wild or wicked things it was because she could not help them. The moon affects her as it does a woman, he thought.","You expected to be sad in the fall.

You belong to me and all Paris belongs to me and I belong to this notebook and this pencil. Then I went back to writing and I entered far into the story and was lost in it. I was writing it now and it was not writing itself and I did not look up nor know anything about the time nor think where I was nor order any more rum St. James. I was tired of rum St. James without thinking about it. Then the story was finished and I was very tired. I read the last paragraph and then I looked up and looked for the girl and she had gone. I hope she\u2019s gone with a good man, I thought. But I felt sad.","But, you say, there is very little conversation in this book. Why isn\'t there more dialoge? What we want in a book by this citizen is people talking; that is all he knows how to do and now he doesn\'t do it. The fellow is no philosopher, no savant, an incompetent zoologist, he drinks too much and cannot punctuate readily and now he has stopped writing dialogue. Some one ought to put a stop to him. He is bull crazy.","I remember all of these things happening and the places we lived in and the fine times and the bad times we had in that year. But much more vividly I remember living in the book and making up what happened in it every day. Making the country and the people and the things that happened I was happier than I had ever been. Each day I read the book through from the beginning to the point where I went on writing and each day I stopped when I was still going good and when I knew what would happen next. The fact the book was a tragic one did not make me unhappy since I believed that life was a tragedy and knew it could have only one end. But finding you were able to make something up; to create truly enough so that it made you happy to read it; and to do this every day you worked was something that gave a greater pleasure than any I had ever known. Beside it nothing else mattered.","Maybe away from Paris I could write about Paris as in Paris I could write about Michigan. I did not know it was too early for that because I did not know Paris well enough. But that was how it worked out eventually.

There are enough problems now without sin. Also, I have no understanding of it. \u2026 and I am not sure that I believe in it. Perhaps it was a sin to kill the fish. I suppose it was even though I did it to keep me alive and feed many people. But then everything is a sin. Do not think about sin. It is much too late for that and there are people who are paid to do it. Let them think about it. You were born to be a fisherman as the fish was born to be a fish.....You did not kill the fish only to keep alive and to sell for food, he thought. You killed him for pride and because you are a fisherman. You loved him when he was alive and you loved him after. If you love him, it is not a sin to kill him. Or is it more?Everything kills everything else in some way. Fishing kills me exactly as it keeps me alive.\u201cDon\u2019t think, old man, he said aloud. \u201cSail on this course and take it when it comes. But I must think, he thought.

And what beat you, he thought. \u201cNothing,\u201d he said aloud. \u201cI went out too far.\u201d","My wife and I had called on Miss Stein, and she and the friend who lived with her had been very cordial and friendly and we had loved the big studio with the great paintings. It was like one of the best rooms in the finest museum except there was a big fireplace and it was warm and comfortable and they gave you good things to eat and tea and natural distilled liqueurs made from purple plums, yellow plums or wild raspberries. These were fragrant, colorless alcohols served from cut-glass carafes in small glasses and whether they were quetsche, mirabelle or framboise they all tasted like the fruits they came from, converted into a controlled fire on your tongue that warmed you and loosened your tongue. Miss Stein was very big but not tall and was heavily built like a peasant woman. She had beautiful eyes and a strong German-Jewish face that also could have been Friulano and she reminded me of a northern Italian peasant woman with her clothes, her mobile face and her lovely, thick, alive immigrant hair which she wore put up in the same way she had probably worn it in college. She talked all the time and at first it was about people and places.","In those days there was no money to buy books. Books you borrowed from the rental library of Shakespeare and Company, which was the library and bookstore of Sylvia Beach at 12 rue de l\u2019Od\xe9on. On a cold windswept street, this was a lovely, warm, cheerful place with a big stove in winter, tables and shelves of books, new books in the window, and photographs on the wall of famous writers both dead and living. The photographs all looked like snapshots and even the dead writers looked as though they had really been alive. Sylvia had a lively, very sharply cut face, brown eyes that were as alive as a small animal\u2019s and as gay as a young girl\u2019s, and wavy brown hair that was brushed back from her fine forehead and cut thick below her ears and at the line of the collar of the brown velvet jacket she wore. She had pretty legs and she was kind, cheerful and interested, and loved to make jokes and gossip. No one that I ever knew was nicer to me. I was very shy when I first went into the bookshop and I did not have enough money on me to join the rental library. She told me I could pay the deposit any time I had the money and made me out a card and said I could take as many books as I wished. There was no reason for her to trust me. She did not know me and the address I had given her, 74 rue Cardinal Lemoine, could not have been a poorer one. But she was delightful and charming and welcoming and behind her, as high as the wall and stretching out into the back room which gave onto the inner court of the building, were the shelves and shelves of the richness of the library.","Bad luck to your mother.","We are all apprentices in a craft where no one ever becomes a master","Write the truest sentence you know.

I believe that all the people who stand to profit by a war and who help provoke it should be shot on the first day it starts by accredited representatives of the loyal citizens of their country who will fight it. The author of this book would be very glad to take charge of this shooting.","I could picture it.

Now you were accustomed to see the bare trees against the sky and you walked on the fresh-washed gravel paths through the Luxembourg gardens in the clear sharp wind. The trees were beautiful without their leaves when you were reconciled to them, and the winter winds blew across the surfaces of the ponds and the fountains were blowing in the bright light. All the distances were short now since we had been in the mountains.

In him, too, was despair from the sorrow that soldiers turn to hatred in order that they may continue to be soldiers. Now it was over he was lonely, detached and unrelated and he hated every one he saw.","Don\'t forget to tell Pedrico the head is his.","and I felt the death loneliness that comes at the end of every day that is wasted in your life","But when I am with Maria I love her so that I feel, literally, as though I would die and I never believed in that nor thought that it could happen.So if your life trades its seventy years for seventy hours I have that value now and I am lucky enough to know it.

The only bad thing is to die at the hands of this canalla.","He had been successful in almost every way except in his married life, although he had never cared, truly, about success. What he cared about was painting and his children and he was still in love with the first woman he had been in love with. He had loved many women since and sometimes someone would come to stay on the island. He needed to see women and they were welcome for a while. He liked having them there, sometimes for quite a long time. But in the end he was always glad when they were gone, even when he was very fond of them. He had trained himself not to quarrel with women anymore and he had learned how not to get married. These two things had been nearly as difficult to learn as how to settle down and paint in a steady and well-ordered way.","It is a curious fact of literary history that a story which describes the loss of a gigantic prize provided the author with the greatest prize of his career. \u2014","Nick did not want to go in there now. He felt a reaction against deep wading with the water deepening up under his armpits, to hook big trout in places impossible to land them. In the swamp the banks were bare, the big cedars came together overhead, the sun did not come through, except in patches; in the fast deep water, in the half light, the fishing would be tragic. In the swamp fishing was a tragic adventure. Nick did not want it. He did not want to go down the stream any farther today.

He is just never satisfied that a thing cannot be done better.","So, Robert Wilson thought to himself, she is giving him a ride, isn\u2019t she? Or do you suppose that\u2019s her idea of putting up a good show? How should a woman act when she discovers her husband is a bloody coward? She\u2019s damn cruel but they\u2019re all cruel.

She had some ignition trouble with the old Model T Ford she then drove and the young man who worked in the garage and had served in the last year of the war had not been adept, or perhaps had not broken the priority of other vehicles, in repairing Miss Stein\'s Ford. Perhaps he had not realized the importance of Miss Stein\'s vehicle having the right of immediate repair. Anyway he had not been s\xe9rieux and had been corrected severely by the patron of the garage after Miss Stein\'s protest. The patron had said to him, \'You are all a g\xe9n\xe9ration perdue.\' \'That\'s what you are. That\'s what you all are,\' Miss Stein said. \'All of you young people who served in the war.

Those we remember and visit sometimes when we are asleep and dreaming. They are as lovely at night as they were when we were children. If you ever go back to see them they are not there. But they are as fine in the night as they ever were if you have the luck to dream of them.","When George Plimpton asked Ernest Hemingway what the best training for an aspiring writer would be in a 1954 interview, Hem replied, \u201cLet\u2019s say that he should go out and hang himself because he finds that writing well is impossibly difficult. Then he should be cut down without mercy and forced by his own self to write as well as he can for the rest of his life. At least he will have the story of the hanging to commence with.","I don\u2019t want any one else to touch you. I\u2019m silly.

That he was a great poet and a gentle and generous man and could have accommodated himself in a normal-size chair was not considered.","I wonder how they will like Maria in Missoula, Montana? That is if I can get a job back in Missoula. I suppose that I am ticketed as a Red there now for good and will be on the general blacklist. Though you never know. You never can tell. They\'ve no proof of what you do, and as a matter of fact they would never believe it if you told them, and my passport was valid for Spain before they issued the restrictions.The time for getting back will not be until the fall of thirty-seven. I left in the summer of thirty-six and though the leave is for a year you do not need to be back until the fall term opens in the following year. There is a lot of time between now and the fall term. There is a lot of time between now and the day after tomorrow if you want to put it that way. No. I think there is no need to worry about the university. Just you turn up there in the fall and it will be all right. Just try and turn up there.But it has been a strange life for a long time now. Damned if it hasn\'t. Spain was your work and your job, so being in Spain was natural and sound. You had worked summers on engineering projects and in the forest service building roads and in the park and learned to handle powder, so the demolition was a sound and normal job too. Always a little hasty, but sound.Once you accept the idea of demolition as a problem it is only a problem. But there was plenty that was not so good that went with it although God knows you took it easily enough. There was the constant attempt to approximate the conditions of successful assassination that accompanied the demolition. Did big words make it more defensible? Did they make killing any more palatable? You took to it a little too readily if you ask me, he told himself. And what you will be like or just exactly what you will be suited for when you leave the service of the Republic is, to me, he thought, extremely doubtful. But my guess is you will get rid of all that by writing about it, he said. Once you write it down it is all gone. It will be a good book if you can write it. Much better than the other.But in the meantime all the life you have or ever will have is today, tonight, tomorrow, today, tonight, tomorrow, over and over again (I hope), he thought and so you had better take what time there is and be very thankful for it.

The male fish always let the female fish feed first and the hooked fish, the female, made a wild, panic-stricken, despairing fight that soon exhausted her, and all the time the male had stayed with her, crossing the line and circling with her on the surface. He had stayed so close that the old man was afraid he would cut the line with his tail which was sharp as a scythe and almost of that size and shape. When the old man had gaffed her and clubbed her, holding the rapier bill with its sandpaper edge and clubbing her across the top of her head until her colour turned to a colour almost like the backing of mirrors, and then, with the boy\'s aid, hoisted her aboard, the male fish had stayed by the side of the boat. Then, while the old man was clearing the lines and preparing the harpoon, the male fish jumped high into the air beside the boat to see where the female was and then went down deep, his lavender wings, that were his pectoral fins, spread wide and all his wide lavender stripes showing. He was beautiful, the old man remembered, and he had stayed.

He had other qualities no one knew about and the other two boys respected him immensely although they tried to tease him and tear him down on any point where he was vulnerable.
