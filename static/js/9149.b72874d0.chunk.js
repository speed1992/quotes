Go with the flow of things, and you will find yourself at one with the mysterious unity of the Universe.","When people do not ignore what they should ignore, but ignore what they should not ignore, this is known as ignorance.","The effect of life in society is to complicate and confuse  our existence, making us forget who we really are  by causing us to become obsessed with what we are not.","The perfect man uses his mind as a mirror. It grasps nothing. It regrets nothing. It receives but does not keep.","Perfect happiness is the absence of striving for happiness.","A path is made by walking on it.","We cling to our own point of view, as though everything depended on it. Yet our opinions have no permanence; like autumn and winter, they gradually pass away.","Your preciousness lies in your essence; it cannot be lost by anything that happens.","The wise man knows that it is better to sit on the banks of a remote mountain stream than to be emperor of the whole world.","Do not seek fame. Do not make plans. Do not be absorbed by activities. Do not think that you know. Be aware of all that is and dwell in the infinite. Wander where there is no path. Be all that heaven gave you, but act as though you have received nothing. Be empty, that is all.","Once upon a time, I dreamt I was a butterfly, fluttering hither and thither, to all intents and purposes a butterfly. I was conscious only of my happiness as a butterfly, unaware that I was myself. Soon I awaked, and there I was, veritably myself again. Now I do not know whether I was then a man dreaming I was a butterfly, or whether I am now a butterfly, dreaming I am a man.","The greatest tragedy that can befall a person is the atrophy of his mind.","Do not let the artificial obliterate the natural; do not let will obliterate destiny; do not let virtue be sacrificed to fame.","Flow with whatever may happen and let your mind be free. Stay centered by accepting whatever you are doing. This is the ultimate.","Words exist because of meaning; once you\u2019ve gotten the meaning, you can forget the words.","A petty thief is put in jail. A great brigand becomes a ruler of a Nation.","In a river mist, if another boat knocks against yours, you might yell at the other fellow to stay clear. But if you notice then, that it\'s an empty boat, adrift with nobody aboard, you stop yelling. When you discover that all the others are drifting boats, there\'s no one to yell at. And when you find out you are an empty boat, there\'s no one to yell.","Silence, and non action are the root of all things.","Let everything be allowed to do what it naturally does, so that its nature will be satisfied.","When he tries to extend his power over objects, those objects gain control of him. He who is controlled by objects loses possession of his inner self... Prisoners in the world of object, they have no choice but to submit to the demands of matter! They are pressed down and crushed by external forces: fashion, the market, events, public opinion. Never in a whole lifetime do they recover their right mind!... What a pity!","Birth is not a beginning; death is not an end. There is existence without limitation; there is continuity without a starting point.","When an archer shoots for enjoyment, he has all his skill; when he shoots for a brass buckle, he gets nervous; when he shoots for a prize of gold, he begins to see two targets.","Great knowledge sees all in one. Small knowledge breaks down into the many.","A frog in a well cannot conceive of the ocean.","My opinion is that you never find happiness until you stop looking for it.","Rewards and punishments are the lowest form of education.","To exercise no-thought and rest in nothing is the first step toward resting in Tao. To start from nowhere and follow no road is the first step toward attaining Tao.","If the Way is made clear, it is not the Way.","Let your mind wander in the pure and simple. Be one with the infinite. Let all things take their course.","Look at this window: it is nothing but a hole in the wall, but because of it the whole room is full of light. So when the faculties are empty, the heart is full of light.","The Portal of God is nonexistence. All things sprang from nonexistence. Existence could not make existence existence. It must have proceeded from nonexistence, and nonexistence and nothing are one. Herein is the abiding place of the sage.","Never admire a man by his strength; judge him in how he uses it- A way is made by walking it","When I look at what the world does and where people nowadays believe they can find happiness, I am not sure that that is true happiness. The happiness of these ordinary people seems to consist in slavishly imitating the majority, as if this were their only choice. And yet they all believe they are happy. I cannot decide whether that is happiness or not. Is there such a thing as happiness?","Take care of your body, then the rest will automatically become stronger.","If you have insight, you use your inner eye, your inner ear, to pierce to the heart of things, and have no need of intellectual knowledge.","The right way to go easy is to forget the right way.","When the shoe fits, the foot is forgotten. When the belt fits, the belly is forgotten. When the heart is right, \\"for\\" and \\"against\\" are forgotten. No drives, no compulsions, no needs, no attractions: Then your affairs are under control. You are a free man.","We are born from a quiet sleep, and we die to a calm awakening","He who dreams ... does not know he is dreaming... . Only when he awakens does he know he has dreamt. But there is also the great awakening (ta-chiao), and then we see that [everything] here is nothing but a great dream. Of course, the fools believe that they are already awake-what foolishness! Confucius and you, both of you, are dreams; and I, who tell you this, am also a dream.","The fish trap exists because of the fish.  Once you\'ve gotten the fish you can forget the trap.  The rabbit snare exists because of the rabbit.  Once you\'ve gotten the rabbit, you can forget the snare.  Words exist because of meaning.  Once you\'ve gotten the meaning, you can forget the words.  Where can I find a man who has forgotten words so I can talk with him?","If you want to nourish a bird, you should let it live any way it chooses. Creatures differ because they have different likes and dislikes. Therefore the sages never require the same ability from all creatures. . . concepts of right should be founded on what is suitable. The true saint leaves wisdom to the ants, takes a cue from the fishes, and leaves willfulness to the sheep.","The ultimate happiness is doing nothing.","Flow with whatever may happen and let your mind be free.","When there is no more separation between \'this\' and \'that,\' it is called the still-point of the Tao. At the still point in the center of the circle one can see the infinite in all things.","The sound of water says what I think.","The enlightened attention rejects nothing nor welcomes anything-like a mirror it responds equally to all.","Your mind must become one, do not try to understand with your ears but with your heart. Indeed, not with your heart but with your soul.","To be truly ignorant, be content with your own knowledge.","Those who follow the Tao are of clear mind. They do not load their mind with anxieties and are flexible in their adjustment to external conditions.","True men\\" ... are strong willed, have dignity in their demeanor, serenity in their expression. They are cool like autumn, warm like spring. Their passions arise like the four seasons, in harmony with the ten thousand creatures, and no one knows their limits.","The torch of doubt and chaos, this is what the sage steers by.","Breathing control gives man strength, vitality, inspiration, and magic powers.","Those who realise their folly are not true fools.","Goods and possessions are no gain in his eyes. He stays far from wealth and honor. Long life is no ground for joy, nor early death for sorrow. Success is not for him to be pround of, failure is no shame. Had he all the world\'s power he would not hold it as his own. If he conquered everything he would not take it to himself. His glory is in knowing that all things come together in One and life and death are equal.","If there is existence, there must be non-existence. And if there was a time when nothing existed, there must have been a time before that - when even nothing did not exist. Suddenly, when nothing came into existence, could one really say whether it belonged to the category of existence or non-existence?","When deeds and words are in accord, the whole world is transformed.","Transmit the established facts; do not transmit words of exaggeration. If you do that, you will probably come out all right.","Forget the years, forget distinctions. Leap into the boundless and make it your home!","If you persist in trying to attain what is never attained (It is Tao\'s gift), if you persist in making effort to obtain what effort cannot get, if you persist in reasoning about what cannot be understood, you will be destroyed by the very thing you seek. To know when to stop, to know when you can get no further by your own action, this is the right beginning!","Great knowledge is universal. Small knowledge is limited. Great words are inspiring; small words are chatter.","Easy is right. Begin right and you are easy. Continue easy and you are right. The right way to go easy is to forget the right way, and forget that the going is easy.","Luck implies an absolute absence of any principle.","The mind remains undetermined in the great Void. Here the highest knowledge is unbounded. That which gives things their thusness cannot be delimited by things. So when we speak of \'limits\', we remain confined to limited things. The limit of the unlimited is called \'fullness.\' The limitlessness of the limited is called \'emptiness.\' Tao is the source of both. But it is itself neither fullness nor emptiness","If one is true to one\'s inner self, and follows its wisdom, who is without a teacher?","An archer competing for a clay vessel shoots effortlessly, his or her skill and concentration unimpeded.  If the prize is changed to a brass ornament, the hands begin to shake. If it is changed to gold, he or she squints as if going blind.  The abilities do not deteriorate, but belief in them does, as he or she allows the supposed value of an external reward to cloud the vision.","Cherish that which is in you and shut out that which is without, for much knowledge is a curse.","The saying goes, \'The sage rests, truly rests and is at ease.\' This manifests itself in calmness and detachment, so that worries and distress cannot affect him, nothing unpleasant can disturb him, his Virtue is complete and his spirit is not stirred up.","As regards the quietude of the sage, he is not quiet because quietness is said to be good. He is quiet because the multitude of things cannot disturb his quietude. When water is still, one\'s beard and eyelashes are reflected in it. A skilled carpenter uses it in a level to obtain a measurement. If still water is so clear, how much more are the mental faculties! The mind of the sage is the mirror of heaven and earth in which all things are reflected.","When an archer is shooting for nothing, he has all his skill. If he shoots for a brass buckle, he is already nervous. If he shoots for a prize of gold, he goes blind or sees two targets - He is out of his mind! His skill has not changed. But the prize divides him. He cares. He thinks more of winning than of shooting- And the need to win drains him of power.","You are still guided by your expectations.","Either in conflict with others or in harmony with them, we go through life like a runaway horse, unable to stop.","Men honor what lies within the sphere of their knowledge, but do not realize how dependent they are on what lies beyond it.","He who regards all things as one is a companion of Nature.","Heaven does nothing: its non-doing is its serenity. Earth does nothing: its non-doing is its rest. From the union of these two non-doings All actions proceed. All things are made. How vast, how invisible This coming-to-be! All things come from nowhere! How vast, how invisible No way to explain it! All beings in their perfection Are born of non-doing. Hence it is said: Heaven and earth do nothing Yet there is nothing they do not do. Where is the man who can attain To this non-doing?","Good fortune is as light as a feather, but nobody knows how to pick it up. Misfortune is as heavy as earth, but nobody knows how to stay out of it\'s way.","Men of this world all rejoice in others being like themselves, and object to others not being like themselves.","All the fish needs is to get lost in the water. All man needs is to get lost in Tao.","Standards are different for all things, so the standard set by man is by no means the only \'certain\' standard. If you mistake what is relative for something certain, you have strayed far from the ultimate truth.","One whose inner being is fixed upon such greatness emits a Heavenly glow. Even though he has this Heavenly glow, others will see him as just a man. Someone who has reached this point will begin to be consistent.","The little child learns to speak, though it has no learned teachers - because it lives with those who know how to speak.","People value that part of knowledge which is known. They do not know how to avail themselves of the Unknown in order to reach knowledge. Is this not misguided?","The baby looks at things all day without winking; that is because his eyes are not focused on any particular object. He goes without knowing where he is going, and stops without knowing what he is doing. He merges himself within the surroundings and moves along with it. These are the principles of mental hygiene.","The perfect man of old looked after himself first before looking to help others.","Good order results spontaneously when things are let alone","Therefore, the truly great man, although he does not injure others, does not credit himself with charity and mercy (these are natural to him). He does not seek gain, but does not despise his followers who do. He struggles not for wealth, but does not take credit for leaving it alone... The ranks and emoluments of the world are to him no cause for joy, it\'s punishments and shame no cause for disgrace.","My description of wisdom has nothing to do with benevolence and righteousness, it is to do with being wise in one\'s own virtue, nothing more. My description of being has nothing to do with benevolence and righteousness, it is that one should be led by one\'s innate nature, nothing more.","Joy, anger, sorrow, happiness, find no place in that man\'s breast; for to him all creation is ONE. And all things being thus united in ONE, his body and limbs are but as dust of the earth, and life and death, beginning, and end, are but as night and day, and cannot destroy his peace. How much less such trifles as gain or loss, misfortune or good fortune?","But you now, you wear your soul on your sleeve, exhausting your energy, propping yourself up on a tree, mumbling, or bent over your desk, asleep. Heaven gives you a form and you wear it out by pointless argument.","The purpose of a fish trap is to catch fish, and when the fish are caught the trap is forgotten. The purpose of a rabbit snare is to catch rabbits. When the rabbits are caught, the snare is forgotten. The purpose of the word is to convey ideas. When the ideas are grasped, the words are forgotten. Where can I find a man who has forgotten words? He is the one I would like to talk to.","He who does his work like a machine grows a heart like a machine and he who carries the heart of a machine in his breast loses his simplicity. He who has lost his simplicity becomes unsure in the strivings of his soul.","All men know the use of the useful, but nobody knows the use of the useless. Where can I find a man who has forgotten words so that I can have a word with him?","He who knows the activities of Nature lives according to Nature.","There is danger for the eye in seeing too clearly, danger for the ear in hearing too sharply and danger to the heart from caring too greatly.","Birth is not the beginning, Death is not the end.","Horses have hoofs to carry them over frost and snow; hair, to protect them from wind and cold. They eat grass and drink water, and fling up their heels.... Such is the real nature of horses.","When you are identified with the One, all things will be complete to you.","You cannot speak of ocean to a well-frog, the creature of a narrower sphere. You cannot speak of ice to a summer insect, the creature of a season.","Right is not right; so is not so. If right were really right it would differ so clearly from not right that there would be no need for argument. If so were really so, it would differ so clearly from not so that there would be no need for argument.","Heaven is in everything: follow the light, hide in the cloudiness and begin in what is. Do this and your understanding will be like not understanding and your wisdom will be like not being wise. By not being wise you will become wise later.","Can a man cling to the positive without any negative in contrast to which it is seen to be positive? If he claims to do so he is a rouge or a madman.","The perfect man employs his mind as a mirror.","Sound intelligence promises victory in every battle.","The sage embraces things. Ordinary men discriminate amongst them and parade their discriminations before others. So I say; those who discriminate, fail to see.","So if loss of what gives happiness causes you distress when it fades, you can now understand that such happiness is worthless. It is said, those who lose themselves in their desire for things also lose their innate nature by being vulgar.","The living all find death unpleasant; men mourn over it. And yet, what is death, but the unbending of the bow and its return to its case?","Calculate what man knows and it cannot compare to what he doesn\'t know. Calculate the time he is alive and it cannot compare to the time before he was born. Yet man takes something so small and tries to exhaust the dimensions of something so large!","I am going to try speaking some reckless words, and I want you to try to listen recklessly.","To be constant is to be useful. To be useful is to realize one\'s true nature. Realization of one\'s true nature is happiness. When one reaches happiness, one is close to perfection.","If a man is crossing the river and an empty boat collides with his skiff, even though he is a bad tempered man he will not become very angry. But if he sees a man in the other boat he will scream and shout and curse at the man to steer clear. If you can empty your own boat crossing the river of the world, no one will oppose you, no one will seek to harm you. Thus is the perfect man - his boat is empty.","Let your mind wander in simplicity, blend your spirit with the vastness, follow along with things the way they are, and make no room for personal views-then the world will be governed.","Understanding that rests in what it does not understand is the finest.","For all people strive to grasp what they do not know, while none strive to grasp what they already know; and all strive to discredit what they do not excel in, while none strive to discredit what they do excel in.  This is why there is chaos.","Where can I find a man who has forgotten words, so I can have a few words with him?","If the Tao could be served up, everyone would serve it up to their lords. If the Tao could be offered, there is no one who would not offer it to their parents. If the Tao could be spoken of, there is no one in the world who would not speak of it to their brothers and sisters. if the Tao could be passed on, there is no one who would not pass it on to their heirs. However, it obviously cannot be so and the reason is as follows. If there is no true centre within to receive it, it cannot remain;if there is no true direction outside to guide it,it cannot be received.","Make your will one! Don\'t listen with your ears, listen with your mind. No, don\'t listen with your mind, but listen with your spirit. Listening stops with the ears, the mind stops with recognition, but spirit is empty- and waits on all things. The Way gathers in emptiness alone. Emptiness is the fasting of the mind.","A battering ram can knock down a city wall, but it cannot stop a hole. Different things have different uses.","People live their lives, constantly surrounded by anxiety. if they live long before dying, they end up in senility, worn out by concerns: a terrible fate! The body is treated in a very harsh fashion. Courageous men are seen by everyone under Heaven as worthy, but this doesn\'t preserve them from death. I am not sure I know whether this is sensible or not.","Although things seem to be sometimes going up and sometimes descending, sometimes slipping away, nevertheless there is a reality, the same today as in the past. It does not change, for nothing can affect it. Could we not say it is one great harmony? So why shouldn\'t we ask about it.","Tao is obscured when men understand only one pair of opposites, or concentrate only on a partial aspect of being. Then clear expression also becomes muddled by mere wordplay, affirming this one aspect and denying all the rest. The pivot of Tao passes through the center where all affirmations and denials converge. He who grasps the pivot is at the still-point from which all movements and oppositions can be seen in their right relationship... Abandoning all thought of imposing a limit or taking sides, he rests in direct intuition.","The non-action of the wise man is not inaction. It is not studied. It is not shaken by anything. The sage is quiet because he is not moved, not because he wills to be quiet. . . . Joy does all things without concern. For emptiness, stillness, tranquillity, tastelessness, silence, and non-action are the root of all things.","Why don\u2019t you try wandering with me to the Palace of Not-Even-Anything","When the shoe fits, the foot is forgotten; when the belt fits, the belly is forgotten; when the heart is right, \\"for\\" and \\"against\\" are forgotten. There is no change in what is inside, no following what is outside, when the adjustment to events is comfortable. One begins with what is comfortable and never experiences what is uncomfortable, when one knows the comfort of forgetting what is comfortable.","Men do not mirror themselves in running water - they mirror themselves in still water. Only what is still can still the stillness of other things.","Heaven does without doing through its purity, Earth does without doing through its calmness.","The Tao is in all things, in their divisions and their fullness. What I dislike about divisions is that they multiply, and what i dislike about multiplication is that it makes people want to hold fast to it. So people go out and forget to return, seeing little more than ghosts.","I cannot tell if what the world considers \u2018happiness\u2019 is happiness or not. All I know is that when I consider the way they go about attaining it, I see them carried away headlong, grim and obsessed, in the general onrush of the human herd, unable to stop themselves or to change their direction. All the while they claim to be just on the point of attaining happiness.","Human life is limited, but knowledge is limitless. To drive the limited in pursuit of the limitless is fatal; and to presume that one really knows is fatal indeed!","And how do I know that the hate of death is not like a man who has lost his home when young and does not know where his home is to return to?","All existing things are really one. We regard those that are beautiful and rare as valuable, and those that are ugly as foul and rotten. The foul and rotten may come to be transformed into what is rare and valuable, and the rare and valuable into what is foul and rotten.","We possess our body by chance and we are already pleased with it. If our physical bodies went through ten thousand transformations without end, how incomparable would this joy be! Therefore the sage roams freely in the realm in which nothing can escape, but all endures.","He who knows he is a fool is not the biggest fool; He who knows he is confused is not in the worst confusion.","Those who seek to satisfy the mind of man by hampering it with ceremonies and music and affecting charity and devotion have lost their original nature.","Life comes from the earth and life returns to the earth.","When the heart is right, \\"for\\" and \\"against\\" are forgotten.","When I talk about having good hearing, I don\'t mean just listening, but listening to yourself. When I talk about good eyesight, I don\'t mean just looking, but looking at yourself.","When affirmation and negation came into being, Tao faded. After Tao faded, then came one-sided attachments.","The Way is to man as rivers and lakes are to fish, the natural condition of life.","The eyes envy the mind.","The World is Large - Its beauty indescrible.","Study is to study what cannot be studied. Undertaking means undertaking what cannot be undertaken. Philosophizing is to philosophize about what cannot be philosophized about. Knowing that knowing is unknowable is true perfection.","The creature born is the creature dying.","Love of colors bewilders the eye and it fails to see right. Love of harmonies bewitches the ear, and it loses its true hearing. Love of perfumes fills the head with dizziness. Love of flavors ruins the taste. Desires unsettle the heart until the original nature runs amok. These five are enemies of true life. Yet these are what men of discernment claim to live for. They are not what I live for. If this is life, then pigeons in a cage have found happiness!","The true man breathes with his heels.","The fact is that those who do not see themselves but who see others, who fail to grasp of themselves but who grasp others, take possession of what others have but fail to possess themselves. they are attracted to what others enjoy but fail to find enjoyment in themselves.","True depth of understanding is wide and steady,\\nShallow understanding is lazy and wandering,\\nWords of wisdom are precise and clear","Great understanding is broad and unhurried; little understanding is cramped and busy","Fish live in water.  Men die in it.Nature is diverse, and not all tastes are the same.","There may be difficulty at the moment, but I will not lose the Virtue that I possess.  It is when the ice and snow are on them that we see the strength of the cypress and the pine.  I am grateful for this trouble around me, because it gives me an opportunity to realize how fortunate I am.","The love of a Sage for his fellows likewise finds expression amongst mankind. Were he not told sop, he would not know that he loved his fellows. But whether he knows it or whether he does not know it, whether he hears it or whether he does not hear it, his love for his is without end, and mankind cease not to repose therein.","If water derives lucidity from stillness, how much more the faculties of the mind! The mind of the sage, being in repose, becomes the mirror of the universe, the speculum of all creation.","Heaven cannot but be high. Earth cannot but be broad. The sun and moon cannot but revolve. All creation cannot but flourish. To do so is their TAO. But it is not from extensive study that this may be known, nor by dialectical skill that his may be made clear. The true sage will have none of these.","To have a human form is a joyful thing.","To regard the fundamental as the essence, to regard things as coarse, to regard accumulation as deficiency, and to dwell quietly alone with the spiritual and the intelligent - herein lie the techniques of Tao of the ancients.","Who knows when the end is reached? Death may be the beginning of life. How do I know that love of life is not a delusion after all? How do I know that he who dreads to die is as a child who has lost the way and cannot find his way home? How do I know that the dead repent of having previously clung to life?","The raven hatches its young; the fish spew forth their eggs; the slim-waisted wasp transforms, and when a younger brother comes along the elder brother weeps. For too long I have not been able to work in harmony with these changes. So, given that I did not play my part in harmony with others, how could I expect to change people?","There is a beginning. There is no beginning of that beginning ... There is something. There is nothing.","To go outside what your charge was, and to try to solve everything yourself, is dangerous.","The hidden so-called scholars of old did not hide themselves and refuse to be seen. They did not close the door on their words and refuse to let them out. They did not shut away their wisdom and refuse to share it. But those times were all haywire. If it had been possible for them to act, they could have done great things, bringing all to Oneness without any sign of doing so. However, the times were not favorable and it was not possible, so they put down deep roots, remained still and waited. this was the Tao by which they survived.","Listening stops with the ears, the mind stops with recognition, but spirit is empty and waits on all things.","Tao is the source of both fullness and emptiness. But it is itself neither fullness nor emptiness.","The birth of a man is the birth of his sorrow. The longer he lives, the more stupid he becomes, because his anxiety to avoid unavoidable death becomes more and more acute. What bitterness! He lives for what is always out of reach! His thirst for survival in the future makes him incapable of living in the present.","Compare birth with death, compare death with life; compare what is possible with what is not possible and compare what is not possible with what is possible; because there is, there is not, and because there is not, there is.","Life is finite, While knowledge is infinite.","Only fools imagine they are already awake. How clearly they understand everything! How easily they distinguish this deception from that reality!","Those that think that wealth is the proper thing for them cannot give up their revenues; those that seek distinction cannot give up the thought of fame; those that cleave to power cannot give the handle of it to others. While they hold their grasp of those things, they are afraid of losing them. When they let them go, they are grieved and they will not look at a single example, from which they might perceive the folly of their restless pursuits - such men are under the doom of heaven.","The bait is the means to get the fish where you want it, catch the fish and you forget the bait. The snare is the means to get the rabbit where you want it, catch the rabbit and forget the snare. Words are the means to get the idea where you want it, catch on to the idea and you forget about the words. Where shall I find a man who forgets about words, and have a word with him?","If you have grasped the purpose of life there is no point in trying to make life into something it is not or cannot be.","Running around accusing others is not as good as laughing. And enjoying a good laugh is not as good as going along with things.","During our dreams we do not know we are dreaming. We may even dream of interpreting a dream. Only on waking do we know it was a dream. Only after the great awakening will we realize that this is the great dream.","For we can only know that we know nothing, and a little knowledge is a dangerous thing.","The sage has the sun and moon by his side and the universe under his arm. He blends everything into a harmonious whole. . . . He blends the disparities of ten thousand years into one complete purity. All things are blended like this and mutually involve each other.","When you\'re dreaming, you don\'t know it\'s a dream. You might even interpret a dream in your dream - and then wake up and realize it was all a dream. Perhaps a great awakening will reveal this to be a dream as well.","Once Zhuangzi dreamt he was a butterfly...","Each one\'s destiny cannot be altered.","Great wisdom is generous; petty wisdom is contentious. Great speech is impassioned, small speech cantankerous.","Sorrow and happiness are the heresies of virtue; joy and anger lead astray from TAO; love and hate cause loss of virtue. The heart unconscious of sorrow and happiness - that is perfect virtue. One, without change - that is perfect repose. Without any obstruction - that is the perfection of the unconditioned. Holding no relations with the external world, - that is perfection of the negative state. Without blemish of any kind, - that is the perfection of purity.","Paraphrased: When Chuang Tzu was about to die, his disciples began planning a splendid funeral. However some disciples expressed concern that given a particular arrangement, birds and kites would eat his remains. Chuang Tzu replied, \\"Well, above ground I shall be eaten by crows and kites, below it by ants and worms. What do you have against birds?","How do I know that loving life is not a delusion? How do I know that in hating death I am not like a man who, having left home in his youth, has forgotten the way back?...someday there will be a great awakening when we know that this is all a great dream. Yet the stupid believe that they are awake, busily and brightly assuming they understand things, calling this man ruler, and that man a herdsman- how dense!","Everything has what is innate,everything has what is necessary.","The one-legged creature is envious of the millipede; the millipede is envious of the snake; the snake is envious of the wind; the wind is envious of the eye; the eye is envious of the heart.","\'I shall have heaven and earth for my coffin and its shell; the sun and moon for my two round symbols of jade, the stars and constellations for my pearls and jewels; and all things assisting as the mourners. Will not the provisions for my funeral be complete? What could you add to them?\'","He who pursues fame at the risk of losing his self is not a scholar.","If water derives lucidity from stillness, how much more the faculties of the mind.","Being is thoughtless-beyond and beneath all categories of thought. Expression is the realization of creative thought. Being is still; expression, moving. But then if I do not strive, who will?","The hundred parts of the body are all complete in their places. Which should one prefer? Do you like them all equally? Are they all servants? Are they unable to control one another and need a ruler? Or do they become rulers and servants in turn? Is there any true ruler other than themselves?","The space under the sky is occupied by all things in their unity.","All men know the utility of useful things; but they do not know the utility of futility.","The knowledge of the ancients reached the highest point-the time before anything existed. This is the highest point. It is exhaustive. There is no adding to it.","Are you and I perchance caught up in a dream from which we have not yet awakened?","I do not know whether I was then a man dreaming I was a butterfly, or whether I am now a butterfly dreaming I am a man.","The eye is a menace to clear sight, the ear is a menace to subtle hearing, the mind is a menace to wisdom, every organ of the senses is a menace to its own capacity.","Thus, those who say they would have right without its correlate, wrong; or good government without its correlate, misrule, do not apprehend the great principles of the universe, nor the nature of all creation.","Yet the stupid believe they are awake, busily and brightly assuming they understand things, calling this man ruler, that one herdsman \u2013 how dense! Confucius and you are both dreaming! And when I say you are dreaming, I am dreaming, too. Words like these will be labeled the Supreme Swindle.","How do I know that loving life is not a delusion? How do I know that in hating death I am not like a man who, having left home in his youth, has forgotten the way back?","All that is limited by form, semblance, sound, color is called object. Among them all, man alone is more than an object. Though, like objects, he has form and semblance, He is not limited to form. He is more. He can attain to formlessness. When he is beyond form and semblance, beyond \\"this\\" and \\"that,\\" where is the comparison with another object? Where is the conflict? What can stand in his way? He will rest in his eternal place which is no-place. He will be hidden in his own unfathomable secret. His nature sinks to its root in the One. His vitality, his power hide in secret Tao.","My most interesting memory is of my first real dream. I was a caterpillar, wriggling around in the earth, just the way a caterpillar would. Following my caterpillar whims, completely unaware of anyone.","To have attained to the human form is a source of joy... What an incomparable bliss it is to undergo these countless transitions.","If we look on heaven and earth as a single crucible, and on the creator as the founder, would there be any place I could not go? When it is time, I will fall asleep, and when the right time comes, I will wake up again.","The Tao has no place for pettiness, and nor has Virtue. Pettiness is dangerous to Virtue; pettiness is dangerous to the Tao. It is said, rectify yourself and be done.","To examine oneself makes good use of sight.","I was given life because it was my time, and now I take leave of it according to the same law. Content with the natural sequence of these events, I am touched neither by joy nor by grief. I am simply hanging in the air ... incapable of freeing myself, tied by the threads of things.","There are no greater adversaries than yin and yang, because nothing in Heaven or on Earth escapes them. But it is not yin and yang that do this, it is your heart that makes it so.","The true man of the past waited upon Heaven when dealing with people and did not wait upon people when dealing with Heaven.","Only the intelligent knows how to identify all things as one. . . . When one is at ease with himself, one is near Tao. This is to let Nature take its own course.","It is only when the formed learns from the unformed that there is understanding.","A man who knows he is a fool is not a great fool.","The man who has some respect for his person keeps his carcass out of sight, hides himself as perfectly as he can.","Men of the world who value the Way all turn to books. But books are nothing more than words. Words have value; what is of value in words is meaning. Meaning has something it is pursuing, but the thing that it is pursuing cannot be put into words and handed down. The world values words and hands down books but, though the world values them, I do not think them worth valuing. What the world takes to be values is not real value.","By ethical argument and moral principle the greatest crimes are eventually shown to have been necessary, and, in fact, a signal benefit to mankind.","The men of old breathed clear down to their heels.","There is a saying that Heaven is internal, humanity external and Virtue comes from the Heavenly. Know Heaven and humanity\'s actions, root yourself in Heaven and follow Virture.Then you can bend, stretch, rush forward or hold back, because you will always return to the core and it will be said you have achieved the supreme.","Tzu Li went to see Tzu Lai who was dying. Leaning against the door, he said, \'Great is the Creator! What will he make of you now? Will he make you into a rat\'s liver? Will he make you into an insect\'s leg?\' Tzu-Lai replied, \'The universe gave me my body so I may be carried, my life so I may work, my old age so I may repose, and my death so I may rest. To regard life as good is the way to regard death as good. . . . If I regard the universe as a great furnace and creation as a master foundryman, why should anywhere I go not be all right?\'","Tao is beyond words and beyond things. It is not expressed either in word or in silence. Where there is no longer word or silence Tao is apprehended.","Beneath multiple specific and individual distinctions, beneath innumerable and incessant transformations, at the bottom of the circular evolution without beginning or end, there hides a law, a unique nature participated in by all beings, in which this common participation produces a ground of common harmony.","The hearing that is only in the ears is one thing. The hearing of the understanding is another. But the hearing of the spirit is not limited to any one faculty to the ear, or to the mind.","The tao is made because we walk it,things become what they are called.","A sage steers by the bright light of confusion and doubt.","Hence it demands the emptiness of all the faculties. And when the faculties are empty, then the whole being listens. There is then a direct grasp of what is right there before you that can never  be heard with the ear or understood with the mind.","I know the joy of fishes in the river through my own joy, as I go walking along the same river.","Verily God does not reward man for what he does, but for what he is.","...the ten thousand things belong to one storehouse and life and death share the same body.","Once I dreamed I was a butterfly, and now I no longer know whether I am Chuang Tzu, who dreamed I was a butterfly, or whether I am a butterfly dreaming that I am Chuang Tzu.","If you wish to care for your body, first of all take care of material things, though even when you have all the things you want, the body can still be uncared for","That knowledge which stops at what it does not know, is the highest knowledge.","Water becomes clear and transparent when in a quiescent stage. How much the more wonderful will be the mind of a sage when poised in quiescence! It is the mirror of heaven and earth, reflecting the ten thousand things.","To use what has a boundary to pursue what is limitless is dangerous; with this knowledge, if we still go after knowledge, we will run into trouble. Do not do what is good in order to gain praise. If you do what is bad be sure to avoid the punishment. Follow the Middle Course, for this is the way to keep yourself together, to sustain your life, to care for your parents and to live for many years.","Once Chuang Chou dreamt he was a butterfly, a butterfly flitting and fluttering around, happy with himself and doing as he pleased. He didn\'t know he was Chuang Chou. Suddenly he woke up and there he was, solid and unmistakeable Chuang Chou. But he didn\'t know if he was Chuang Chou who had dreamt he was a butterfly, or a butterfly dreaming he was Chuang Chou.","Am I a human dreaming I am a butterfly or a butterfly dreaming I am a human?","The whole world is incapable of judging either right or wrong. but it is certain that actionless action can judge both right and wrong.","There is no bandit so powerful as Nature.\\nThe interaction of the positive and the negative principles, which produces the visible universe.\\nIn the whole universe there is no escape from it.","The fish trap exists because of the fish: once you have gotten the meanings, you can forget the words.","Big? Sure. But, he can\'t catch mice! So for your big tree. No use? Then plant it in the wasteland - in emptiness. Walk idly around it and rest under it\'s shadow. No axe or saw prepares its end. No one will ever cut it down. Useless? You should worry!.","Now, when ordinary people attempt to find happiness, I am not sure whether the happiness is really happiness or not. I study what ordinary people do to find happiness, what they struggle for, rushing about apparently unable to stop.","Heaven is like an egg, and the earth is like the yolk of the egg.","Man may rest in the eternal fitness; he may abide in the everlasting; and roam from the beginning to the end of all creation. He may bring his nature to a condition of ONE, he may nourish his strength; he may harmonise his virtue, and so put himself into partnership with God.","Where is that man who has forgotten words that I may have a word with him?","In an archery contest, when the stakes are earthenware tiles a contestant shoots with skill. When the stakes are belt buckles he becomes hesitant, and if the stakes are pure gold he becomes nervous and confused. There is no difference as to his skil.","The fish trap exists because of the fish. Once you\'ve gotten the fish you can forget the trap. The rabbit snare exists because of the rabbit. Once you\'ve gotten the rabbit, you can forget the snare. Words exist because of meaning. Once you\'ve gotten the meaning, you can forget the words. Where can I find a man who has forgotten words so I can talk with him?","Flow with whatever may happen, and let your mind be free: Stay centered by accepting whatever you are doing. This is the ultimate.","Rewards and punishment is the lowest form of education.","Happiness is the abscence of the striving for happiness.","Let your heart be at peace.Watch the turmoil of beingsbut contemplate their return.If you don\'t realize the source,you stumble in confusion and sorrow.When you realize where you come from,you naturally become tolerant,disinterested, amused,kindhearted as a grandmother,dignified as a king.Immersed in the wonder of the Tao,you can deal with whatever life brings you,And when death comes, you are ready.","To a mind that is still, the entire universe surrenders.","If a man crosses a riverand an empty boat collides with his own skiff,Even though he be bad tempered manHe will not become very angry. But if he sees a man in the boat,He will shout at him to steer clear.If the shout is not heard, he will shout again, and yet again, and begin cursing.And all because someone is in the boat.Yet if the boat were empty,He would not be shouting, and not angry.If you can empty your own boatCrossing the river of the world,No one will oppose you, No one will seek to harm you","Only he who has no use for the empire is fit to be entrusted with it.","A frog in a well cannot discuss the ocean, because he is limited by the size of his well. A summer insect cannot discuss ice, because it knows only its own season. A narrow-minded scholar cannot discuss the Tao, because he is constrained by his teachings. Now you have come out of your banks and seen the Great Ocean.

You can\'t discuss ice with a summer insect - he\'s bound to a single season.","Great wisdom is generous; petty wisdom is contentious.","You have only to rest in inaction and things will transform themselves. Smash your form and body, spit out hearing and eyesight, forget you are a thing among other things, and you may join in great unity with the deep and boundless.","So it is said, for him who understands Heavenly joy, life is the working of Heaven; death is the transformation of things. In stillness, he and the yin share a single Virtue; in motion, he and the yang share a single flow.","All men know the use of the useful, but nobody knows the use of the useless!","All attempts to create something admirable are the weapons of evil. You may think you are practising benevolence and righteousness, but in effect you will be creating a kind of artificiality. Where a model exists, copies will be made of it; where success has been gained, boasting follows; where debate exists, there will be outbreaks of hostility.","I\'ve heard my teacher say, where there are machines, there are bound to be machine worries; where there are machine worries, there are bound to be machine hearts. With a machine heart in your breast, you\'ve spoiled what was pure and simple; and without the pure and simple, the life of the spirit knows no rest.","Your life has a limit, but knowledge has none. If you use what is limited to pursue what has no limit, you will be in danger.","Just when the caterpillar thought the world was over, it became a butterfly.","Words are not just wind. Words have something to say. But if what they have to say is not fixed, then do they really say something? Or do they say nothing? People suppose that words are different from the peeps of baby birds, but is there any difference, or isn\'t there? What does the Way rely upon, that we have true and false? What do words rely upon, that we have right and wrong? How can the Way go away and not exist? How can words exist and not be acceptable? When the Way relies on little accomplishments and words reply on vain show, then we have rights and wrongs of the Confucians and the Mo-ists. What one calls right the other calls wrong; what one calls wrong the other calls right. But if we want to right their wrongs and wrong their rights, then the best to use is clarity.","Zhuangzi\'s wife died. When Huizu went to convey his condolences, he found Zhuangzi sitting with his legs sprawled out, pounding on a tub and singing. \\"You lived with her, she brought up your children and grew old,\\" said Huizu. \\"It should be enough simply not to weep at her death. But pounding on a tub and singing - this is going too far, isn\'t it?\\"Zhuangzi said, \\"You\'re wrong. When she first died, do you think I didn\'t grieve like anyone else? But I looked back to her beginning and the time before she was born. Not only the time before she was born, but the time before she had a body. Not only the time before she had a body, but the time before she had a spirit. In the midst of the jumble of wonder and mystery a change took place and she had a spirit. Another change and she had a body. Another change and she was born. Now there\'s been another change and she\'s dead. It\'s just like the progression of the four seasons, spring, summer, fall, winter.\\"Now she\'s going to lie down peacefully in a vast room. If I were to follow after her bawling and sobbing, it would show that I don\'t understand anything about fate. So I stopped.","Cease striving. Then there will be transformation.","Once upon a time, I, Chuang Tzu, dreamt that i was a butterfly. flitting around and enjoying myself. I had no idea I was Chuang Tzu. Then suddenly I woke up and was Chuang Tzu again. But I could not tell, had I been Chuang Tzu dreaming I was a butterfly, or a butterfly dreaming I was now Chuang Tzu? However, there must be some sort of difference between Chuang Tzu and a butterfly! We call this the transformation of things.","I have heard that he who knows what is enough will not let himself be entangled by thoughts of gain; that he who really understands how to find satisfaction will not be afraid of other kinds of loss; and that he who practices the cultivation of what is within him will not be ashamed because he holds no position in society.","The purpose of a fish trap is to catch fish, and when the fish are caught, the trap is forgotten. The purpose of words is to convey ideas. When the ideas are grasped, the words are forgotten. Where can I find a man who has forgotten the words, so that I can talk to him?","To forget the whole world is easy; to make the whole world forget you is hard.","Let your mind wander in simplicity, blend your spirit with the vastness, follow along with things the way they are, and make no room for personal views - then the world will be governed.","The effect of life in society is to complicate and confuse our existence, making us forget who we really are by causing us to become obsessed with what we are not.","He who knows he is a fool is not the biggest fool; he who knows he is confused is not in the worst confusion. The man in the worst confusion will end his life without ever getting straightened out; the biggest fool will end his life without ever seeing the light. If three men are traveling along and one is confused, they will still get where they are going - because confusion is in the minority. But if two of them are confused, then they can walk until they are exhausted and never get anywhere - because confusion is in the majority.","The True Man of ancient times knew nothing of loving life, knew nothing of hating death. He emerged without delight; he went back in without a fuss. He came briskly, he went briskly, and that was all. He didn\'t forget where he began; he didn\'t try to find out where he would end. He received something and took pleasure in it; he forgot about it and handed it back again.","If you\'d called me an ox, I\'d have said I was an ox; if you\'d called me a horse, I\'d have said I was a horse. If the reality is there and you refuse to accept the name men give it, you\'ll only lay yourself open to double harassment.","Not to understand is profound; to understand is shallow. Not to understand is to be on the inside; to understand is to be on the outside.","Don\'t go in and hide; don\'t come out and shine; stand stock-still in the middle.","Don\'t you know about the praying mantis that waved its arms angrily in front of an approaching carriage, unaware that they were incapable of stopping it? Such was the high opinion it had of its talents.","The sage is still not because he takes stillness to be good and therefore is still. The ten thousand things are insufficient to distract his mind - that is the reason he is still.","Great truths do not take hold of the hearts of the masses. And now, as the world is in error, how shall I, though I know the true path, how shall I guide? If I know that I cannot succeed and yet try to force success, this world would be but another source of error. Better then to desist and strive no more. But if I do not strive, who will?","Do not use life to give life to death. Do not use death to bring death to life.","A beam or pillar can be used to batter down a city wall, but it is no good for stopping up a little hole - this refers to a difference in function. Thoroughbreds like Qiji and Hualiu could gallop a thousand li in one day, but when it came to catching rats they were no match for the wildcat or the weasel - this refers to a difference in skill. The horned owl catches fleas at night and can spot the tip of a hair, but when daylight comes, no matter how wide it opens its eyes, it cannot see a mound or a hill - this refers to a difference in nature. Now do you say, that you are going to make Right your master and do away with Wrong, or make Order your master and do away with Disorder? If you do, then you have not understood the principle of heaven and earth or the nature of the ten thousand things. This is like saying that you are going to make Heaven your master and do away with Earth, or make Yin your master and do away with Yang. Obviously it is impossible.","He who has mastered the true nature of life does not labor over what life cannot do. He who has mastered the true nature of fate does not labor over what knowledge cannot change.","Where can I find a man who has forgotten words? He is the one I would like to talk to.","Rest in inaction, and the world will be reformed of itself; Forget your body and spit forth intelligence. Ignore all differences and become one with the Infinite. Release your mind, and free your spirit. Be vacuous, be devoid of soul. Thus will things grow and prosper and return to their Rust and Rest. Returning to their Root. Returning to their Root without their knowing it, the result will be a formless whole which will never be cut up, to know it is to cut it up. (Great Nebulous says to General Clouds)","There is the globe,The foundation of my bodily existence.It wears me out with work and duties,It gives me rest in old age,It gives me peace in death.For the on who supplied me with what I needed in lifeWill also give me what I need in death.","The time of the autumn floods came and the hundred streams poured into the Yellow River. \u2026 Then the Lord of the River was beside himself with Joy, believing that all the beauty in the world belonged to him alone.","A good completion takes a long time; a bad completion cannot be changed later.","Moreover, I have heard that those who are fond of praising men to their faces are also fond of damning them behind their backs.","Things joined by profit, when pressed by misfortune and danger, will cast each other aside.","Forget about life, forget about worrying about right and wrong. Plunge into the unknown and the endless and find your place there!","Right is not right; so is not so. If right were really right, it would differ so clearly from not right that there would be no need for argument. If so were really so, it would differ so clearly from not so that there would be no need for argument. Forget the years; forget distinctions. Leap into the boundless and make it your home!","But a gentleman may embrace a doctrine without necessarily wearing the garb that goes with it, and he may wear the garb without necessarily comprehending the doctrine.","You forget your feet when the shoes are comfortable. You forget your waist when the belt is comfortable. Understanding forgets right and wrong when the mind is comfortable. There is no change in what is inside, no following what is outside, when the adjustment to events is comfortable. You begin with what is comfortable and never experience what is uncomfortable when you know the comfort of forgetting what is comfortable.","It can be passed on, but not received.It can be obtained, but not seen.\u53ef\u50b3\u800c\u4e0d\u53ef\u53d7\uff0c\u53ef\u5f97\u800c\u4e0d\u53ef\u898b.","When you\'re betting for tiles in an archery contest, you shoot with skill. When you\'re betting for fancy belt buckles, you worry about your aim. And when you\'re betting for real gold, you\'re a nervous wreck. Your skill is the same in all three cases - but because one prize means more to you than another, you let outside considerations weigh on your mind. He who looks too hard at the outside gets clumsy on the inside.","Words have value; what is of value in words is meaning. Meaning has something it is pursuing, but the thing that it is pursuing cannot be put into words and handed down.","In the world everyone knows enough to pursue what he does not know, but no one knows enough to pursue what he already knows. Everyone knows enough to condemn what he takes to be no good, but no one knows enough to condemn what he has already taken to be good.","How do I know that the love of life is not a delusion? Or that the fear of death is not like a young person running away from home and unable to find his way back? The Lady Li Chi was the daughter of a border warden, Ai. When the state of Chin captured her, she wept until she had drenched her robes; then she came to the King\u2019s palace, shared the King\u2019s bed, ate his food, and repented of her tears. How do I know whether the dead now repent for their former clinging to life? \u2018Come the morning, those who dream of the drunken feast may weep and moan; when the morning comes, those who dream of weeping and moaning go hunting in the fields. When they dream, they don\u2019t know it is a dream. Indeed, in their dreams they may think they are interpreting dreams, only when they awake do they know it was a dream. Eventually there comes the day of reckoning and awakening, and then we shall know that it was all a great dream. Only fools think that they are now awake and that they really know what is going on, playing the prince and then playing the servant. What fools! The Master and you are both living in a dream. When I say a dream, I am also dreaming. This very saying is a deception. If after ten thousand years we could once meet a truly great sage, one who understands, it would seem as if it had only been a morning.","We can\'t expect a blind man to appreciate beautiful patterns or a deaf man to listen to bells and drums. And blindness and deafness are not confined to the body alone - the understanding has them, too.","When Zhuangzi was about to die, his disciples expressed a desire to give him a sumptuous burial. Zhuangzi said, \\"I will have heaven and earth for my coffin and coffin shell, the sun and moon for my pair of jade discs, the stars and constellations for my pearls and beads, and the ten thousand things for my parting gifts. The furnishings for my funeral are already prepared - what is there to add?","When I speak of good hearing, I do not mean listening to others; I mean simply listening to yourself. When I speak of good eyesight, I do not mean looking at others; I mean simply looking at yourself. He who does not look at himself but looks at others, who does not get hold of himself but gets hold of others, is getting what other men have got and failing to get what he himself has got. He finds joy in what brings joy to other men, but finds no joy in what would bring joy to himself.","When a man does not dwell in self, then things will of themselves reveal their forms to him. His movement is like that of water, his stillness like that of a mirror, his responses like those of an echo.","People who excuse their faults and claim they didn\'t deserved to be punished - there are lots of them. But those who don\'t excuse their faults and admit they didn\'t deserve to be spared - they are few.","Life, death, preservation, loss, failure, success, poverty, riches, worthiness, unworthiness, slander, fame, hunger, thirst, cold, heat - these are the alternations of the world, the workings of fate. Day and night they change place before us, and wisdom cannot spy out their source. Therefore, they should not be enough to destroy your harmony; they should not be allowed to enter the storehouse of the spirit. If you can harmonize and delight in them, master them and never be at a loss for joy; if you can do this day and night without break and make it be spring with everything, mingling with all and creating the moment within your own mind - this is what I call being whole in power.","When men do not forget what can be forgotten but forget what cannot be forgotten - that may be called true forgetting.","In the midst of darkness, he alone sees the dawn; in the midst of the soundless, he alone hears harmony.","When a hideous man becomes a fatherAnd a son is born to himIn the middle of the nightHe trembles and lights a lampAnd runs to look in anguishOn that child\'s faceTo see who he resembles.","Men all pay homage to what understanding understands, but no one understands enough to rely upon what understanding does not understand and thereby come to understand.","The man who has forgotten self may be said to have entered Heaven.","A man like this will not go where he has no will to go, will not do what he has no mind to do. Though the world might praise him and say he had really found something, he would look unconcerned and never turn his head; though the world might condemn him and say he had lost something, he would look serene and pay no heed. The praise and blame of the world are no loss or gain to him.","If you were to hide the world in the world, so that nothing could get away, this would be the final reality of the constancy of things.","Eyes that are blind have no way to tell the loveliness of faces and features; eyes with no pupils have no way to tell the beauty of colored and embroidered silks.","Si tu veux trouver la paix, immerge-toi dans la bienveillance, \xe9teins tous les d\xe9sirs dans ton coeur, retire-toi dans la solitude","Can you be a little baby? The baby howls all day, yet its throat never gets hoarse - harmony at its height! The baby makes fists all day, yet its fingers never get cramped - virtue is all it holds to. The baby stares all day without blinking its eyes - it has no preferences in the world of externals.","With all the confusion in the world these days, no matter how often I point the way, what good does it do? And if I know it does no good and still make myself do it, this too is a kind of confusion. So it is best to leave things alone and not force them. If I don\'t force things, at least I won\'t cause anyone any worry.","So it is that the great man through his actions will not set out to harm others, nor make much of benevolence and charity; he does not make any move for gain, nor consider the servant at the gate as lowly; he will not barter for property and riches, nor does he make much of having turned them down; he asks for no one\u2019s help, nor does he make much of his own self-reliance, nor despise the greedy and mean; he does not follow the crowd, nor does he make much of being so different; he comes behind the crowd, but does not make much of those who get ahead through flattery. The titles and honours of this world are of no interest to him, nor is he concerned at the disgrace of punishments. He knows there is no distinction between right and wrong, nor between great and little. I have heard it said, \u201cThe Tao man earns no reputation, perfect Virtue is not followed, the great man is self-less. In perfection, this is the path he follows.\u201d","To guard yourself against thieves who slash open suitcases, rifle through bags and smash open boxes, one should strap the bags and lock them. The world at large knows that this shows wisdom. However, when a master thief comes, he simply picks up the suitcase, lifts the bag, carries off the box and runs away with them, his only concern being whether the straps and locks will hold! In such an instance, what seemed like wisdom on the part of the owner surely turns out to have been of use only to the master thief!","It comes out from no source, it goes back in through no aperture. It has reality yet no place where it resides; it has duration yet no beginning or end. Something emerges, though through no aperture - this refers to the fact that it has reality. It has reality yet there is no place where it resides - this refers to the dimension of space. It has duration but no beginning or end - this refers to the dimension of time. There is life, there is death, there is a coming out, there is a going back in - yet in the coming out and going back its form is never seen. This is called the Heavenly Gate. The Heavenly Gate is nonbeing. The ten thousand things come forth from nonbeing. Being cannot create being out of being; inevitably it must come forth from nonbeing. Nonbeing is absolute nonbeing, and it is here that the sage hides himself.","How do I know that the dead don\u2019t regret the way they used to cling to life?","Those who count things are not worthy of assisting the people.","Emptiness is the fasting of the mind.","He who steals a belt buckle pays with his life; he who steals a state gets to be a feudal lord.","I dreamed I was a butterfly, flitting around in the sky; then I awoke. Now I wonder: Am I a man who dreamt of being a butterfly, or am I a butterfly dreaming that I am a man?","A wandering carpenter, called Stone, saw on his travels a gigantic old oak tree standing in a field near an earth-altar. The carpenter said to his apprentice, who was admiring the oak: \\"This is a useless tree. If you wanted to make a ship, it would soon rot; if you wanted to make tools, they would break. You can\'t do anything useful with this tree, and that\'s why it has become so old.","In an age of Perfect Virtue, the worthy are not honored; the talented are not employed. Rulers are like the high branches of a tree; the people, like the deer of the fields. They do what is right, but they do not know that this is righteousness. They love one another, but they do not know that this is benevolence. They are truehearted but do not know that this is loyalty. They are trustworthy but do not know that this is good faith. They wriggle around like insects, performing services for one another, but do not know that they are being kind. Therefore they move without leaving any trail behind, act without leaving any memory of their deeds.","The Great Course is unproclaimed. Great demonstration uses no words. (2:34) Great Humanity is not humane. Great rectitude is not fastidious. Great courage is not invasive. For when the Course becomes explicit, it ceases to be the Course. When words demonstrate by debate, they fail to communicate. When Humanity is constantly sustained, it cannot reach its maturity.21 When rectitude is pure, it cannot extend itself to others. When courage is invasive, it cannot succeed.22 These five are originally round, but they are forced toward squareness.","A child, obeying his father and mother, goes wherever he is told, east or west, south or north. And the yin and yang - how much more are they to a man than father or mother! Now that they have brought me to the verge of death, if I should refuse to obey them, how perverse I would be! What fault is it of theirs? The Great Clod burdens me with form, labors me with life, eases me in old age, and rests me in death. So if I think well of my life, for the same reason I must think well of my death. When a skilled smith is casting metal, if the metal should leap up and say, \'I insist upon being made into a Moye!\' he would surely regard it as very inauspicious metal indeed. Now, having had the audacity to take on human form once, if I should say, \'I don\'t want to be anything but a man! Nothing but a man!\', the Creator would surely regard me as a most inauspicious sort of person. So now I think of heaven and earth as a great furnace, and the Creator as a skilled smith. Where could he send me that would not be all right? I will go off to sleep peacefully, and then with a start I will wake up.","When there is both name and reality, We dwell in the realm of things; When there is neither name nor reality, We exist in a vacuity of things. We can speak and can think, But the more we speak, the further off we are. What is not yet born cannot be forbidden, What is already dead cannot be prevented. Death and birth are not distant, It\'s their principle that cannot be seen.","How do I know that loving life is not a delusion? How do I know that in hating death I am not like a man who, having left home in his youth, has forgotten the way back?Lady Li was the daughter of the border guard of Ai. When she was first taken captive and brought to the state of Jin, she wept until her tears drenched the collar of her robe. But later, when she went to live in the palace of the ruler, shared his couch with him, and ate the delicious meats of his table, she wondered why she had ever wept. How do I know that the dead do not wonder why they ever longed for life?","Eventually there comes the day of reckoning and awakening, and then we shall know that it was all a great dream. Only fools think that they are now awake and that they really know what is going on, playing the prince and then playing the servant. What fools! The Master and you are both living in a dream. When I say a dream, I am also dreaming. This very saying is a deception. If after ten thousand years we could once meet a truly great sage, one who understands, it would seem as if it had only been a morning.","Now I wonder: Am I a man who dreamt of being a butterfly, or am I a butterfly dreaming that I am a man?","Joy and anger, sorrow and happiness, caution and remorse Come upon us by turns, with ever changing mood. They come like music from hollows, like wood when played by the wind, or how mushrooms grow from the damp. Daily and nightly they alternate within but we cannot tell whence they spring. Without these emotions I should not be. Without me, they would have no instrument","Thus, the Sage uses various rights and wrongs to harmonize with others and yet remains at rest in the middle of Heaven the Potter\u2019s Wheel.","Waiting for changing opinions is like waiting for nothing.","Today, I went to sleep under a plum tree. There, I dreamed I was a butterfly, flying so pleasently. Then, I fell asleep, and the dream ended. Now- I have to ask myself - am I Zhuang Zi who dreamed of a butterfly? Or am I that butterfly, dreaming I am Zhuang Zi?","It is widely recognized that the courageous spirit of a single man can inspire to victory an army of thousands. If one concerned with ordinary gain can create such an effect, how much more will be produced by one who for greater things cares!","Everything has its \\"that,\\" everything has its \\"this.\\" From the point of view of \\"that\\" you cannot see it, but through understanding you can know it. So I say, \\"that\\" comes out of \\"this\\" and \\"this\\" depends on \\"that\\" - which is to say that \\"this\\" and \\"that\\" give birth to each other. But where there is birth there must be death; where there is death there must be birth. Where there is acceptability there must be unacceptability; where there is unacceptability there must be acceptability. Where there is recognition of right there must be recognition of wrong; where there is recognition of wrong there must be recognition of right. Therefore the sage does not proceed in such a way, but illuminates all in the light of Heaven. He too recognizes a \\"this,\\" but a \\"this\\" which is also \\"that,\\" a \\"that\\" which is also \\"this.\\" His \\"that\\" has both a right and a wrong in it; his \\"this\\" too has both a right and a wrong in it. So, in fact, does he still have a \\"this\\" and \\"that\\"? Or does he in fact no longer have a \\"this\\" and \\"that\\"? A state in which \\"this\\" and \\"that\\" no longer find their opposites is called the hinge of the Way. When the hinge is fitted into the socket, it can respond endlessly. Its right then is a single endlessness and its wrong too is a single endlessness. So, I say, the best thing to use is clarity.","Master Dongguo asked Zhuangzi, \\"This thing called the Way - where does it exist?\\"Zhuangzi said, \\"There\'s no place it doesn\'t exist.\\"\\"Come,\\" said Master Dongguo, \\"you must be more specific!\\"\\"It is in the ant.\\"\\"As low a thing as that?\\"\\"It is in the panic grass.\\"\\"But that\'s lower still!\\"\\"It is in the tiles and shards.\\"\\"How can it be so low?\\"\\"It is in the piss and shit!","You should find the same joy in one condition as in the other and thereby be free of care, that is all. But now, when the things that happened along take their leave, you cease to be joyful. From this point of view, though you have joy, it will always be fated for destruction.","And someday there will be a great awakening when we know that this is all a great dream. Yet the stupid believe they are awake, busily and brightly assuming they understand things, calling this man ruler, that one herdsman\u2014how dense! Confucius and you both are dreaming! And when I say you are dreaming, I am dreaming, too. Words like these will be labeled the Supreme Swindle. Yet after ten thousand generations, a great sage may appear who will know their meaning, and it will still be as though he appeared with astonishing speed.","The fact is that those who do not see themselves but who see others, who fail to get a grasp of themselves but who grasp others, take possession of what others have but fail to possessthemselves. They are attracted to what others enjoy but fail to find enjoyment in themselves.","Now you, Sir, have a large tree, and you don\u2019t know how to use it, so why not plant it in the middle of nowhere, where you can go to wander or fall asleep under its shade? No axe under Heaven will attack it, nor shorten its days, for something which is useless will never be disturbed.","The Spirit Tower has its guardian, but unless it understands who its guardian is, it cannot be guarded.","Therefore the Way that is sagely within and kingly without has fallen into darkness and is no longer clearly perceived, has become shrouded and no longer shines forth. The men of the world all follow their own desires and make these their \u201cdoctrine. How sad!\u2014the hundred schools going on and on instead of turning back, fated never to join again. The scholars of later ages have unfortunately never perceived the purity of Heaven and earth, the great body of the ancients, and \u201cthe art of the Way\u201d in time comes to be rent and torn apart by the world.\u201d","The man of spirit, on the other hand, hates to see people gather around him. He avoids the crowd. For where there are many men, there are also many opinions and little agreement. There is nothing to be gained from the support of a lot of half-wits who are doomed to end up in a fight with each other.The man of spirit is neither very intimate with anyone, nor very aloof. He keeps himself interiorly aware, and he maintains his balance so that he is in conflict with nobody. This is your true man! He lets the ants be clever. He lets the mutton reek with activity. For his own part, he imitates the fish that swims unconcerned, surrounded by a friendly element, and minding its own business.The true man sees what the eye sees, and does not add to it something that is not there. He hears what the ears hear, and does not detect imaginary undertones or overtones. He understands things in their obvious interpretation and is not busy with hidden meanings and mysteries. His course is therefore a straight line. Yet he can change his direction whenever circumstances suggest it.","When she had just died, I could not help being affected. Soon, however, I examined the matter from the very beginning. At the very beginning, she was not living, having no form, nor even substance. But somehow or other there was then her substance, then her form, and then her life. Now by a further change, she has died. The whole process is like the sequence of the four seasons, spring, summer, autumn, and winter. While she is thus lying in the great mansion of the universe, for me to go about weeping and wailing would be to proclaim myself ignorant of the natural laws. Therefore I stopped!","I obtained life because the time was right. I will lose life because it is time. Those who go quietly with the flow of nature are not worried by either joy or sorrow. People like these were considered in the past as having achieved freedom from bondage. Those who cannot free themselves are constrained by things.","I\u2019m going to try speaking some reckless words, and I want you to listen recklessly.","To use a finger as a metaphor for the nonfingerness of a finger is not as good as using nonfingerness as a metaphor for the nonfingerness of a finger.","Zhuangzi and Huizi were strolling along the dam of the Hao River when Zhuangzi said, \u201cSee how the minnows come out and dart around where they please! That\u2019s what fish really enjoy!Huizi said, \u201cYou\u2019re not a fish\u2014how do you know what fish enjoy?\u201dZhuangzi said, \u201cYou\u2019re not I, so how do you know that I don\u2019t know what fish enjoy?\u201dHuizi said, \u201cI\u2019m not you, so I certainly don\u2019t know what you know. On the other hand, you\u2019re certainly not a fish\u2014so that still proves that you don\u2019t know what fish enjoy!\u201dZhuangzi said, \u201cLet\u2019s go back to your original question, please. You asked me how I know what fish enjoy\u2014so you already knew that I knew it when you asked the question. I know it by standing here beside the Hao.\u201d","If a man, having lashed two hulls together, is crossing a river, and an empty boat happens along and bumps into him, no matter how hot-tempered the man may be, he will not get angry. But if there should be someone in the other boat, then he will shout out to haul this way or veer that. If his first shout is unheeded, he will shout again, and if that is not heard, he will shout a third time, this time with a torrent of curses following. In the first instance, he wasn\'t angry; now in the second he is. Earlier he faced emptiness, now he faces occupancy. If a man could succeed in making himself empty, and in that way wander through the world, then who could do him harm?","Suppose I try saying something. What way do I have of knowing that if I say I know something I don\'t really not know it? Or what way do I have of knowing that if I say I don\'t know something I don\'t really in fact know it?","Those who seek to satisfy the mind of man by hampering it with ceremonies and music and affecting charity and devotion have lost their original nature","A fish-trap is for catching fish; once you\'ve caught the fish, you can forget about the trap. A rabbit-snare is for catching rabbits; once you\'ve caught the rabbit, you can forget about the snare. Words are for catching ideas; once you\'ve caught the idea, you can forget about the words.

As such, it meanders between continents, pauses to discuss diet, gives exchange rates, breaks off to speculate, offers a bus timetable, tells an amusing incident, quotes from poetry, relates a story, cites scripture.

The question Zhuangzi faces is indeed among the most fundamental human problems: How should I live my life? Which of the alternate courses should I take as my guide? How is it that I come to choose one course over another? Given that there are alternate ways to see things, why do I, and why should I, see things the way I do rather than another way and thus follow one path rather than another? Zhuangzi\u2019s response to this problem, simply stated, is this: This question can never be answered in the terms in which it has been put, because our understanding consciousness can never know why it sees things one way rather than another, can never ultimately ground its own judgments, and is actually in no position to serve as a guide for living. To consciously weigh alternatives, apply your understanding to making a decision about what is best, and then deliberately follow the course you have decided on\u2014this is the fundamental structure of all purposive activity and conscious knowledge, the basis of all ethics, all philosophy, all politics, all human endeavors at improvement, and this is precisely what Zhuangzi seems to consider ridiculous and impossible. Knowledge is unreliable; Will is unreliable; Tradition is unreliable; Intuition is unreliable; Logic is unreliable; Faith is unreliable. But what else is there?\u201d","You will always find an answer in the sound of water.","Therefore, in a time of Perfect Virtue, the gait of men is slow and ambling; their gaze is steady and mild. In such an age, mountains have no paths or trails, lakes no boats or bridges. The ten thousand things live species by species, one group settled close to another. Birds and beasts form their flocks and herds; grass and trees grow to fullest height. So it happens that you can tie a cord to the birds and beasts and lead them about or bend down the limb and peer into the nest of the crow and the magpie. In this age of Perfect Virtue, men live the same as birds and beasts, group themselves side by side with the ten thousand things. Who then knows anything about \u201cgentleman or \u201cpetty man\u201d? Dull and unwitting, men have no wisdom; thus their Virtue does not depart from them. Dull and unwitting, they have no desire; this is called uncarved simplicity. In uncarved simplicity, the people attain their true nature.\u201d","Ah, said Lien Shu, \u201cit is true that a blind person cannot appreciate beautiful patterns and forms, and the deaf cannot appreciate the music of bells and drums. Yet blindness and deafness do not only afflict people physically, they also exist in the minds and attitudes of people.\u201d","He would have his plans take effect with the speed of fire","Little understanding cannot come up to great understanding; the short-lived cannot come up to the long-lived.","The whole world could praise Song Rongzi and it wouldn\u2019t make him exert himself; the whole world could condemn him and it wouldn\u2019t make him mope. He drew a clear line between the internal and the external, and recognized the boundaries of true glory and disgrace.","A marsh pheasant has to walk ten paces for a bite to eat and a hundred for a sip of water. But still it wouldn\'t want to be tamed and put into a cage. Even treated like a king, it could never be happy and content.","He set forth his intractable ideas but was never partisan or restricted to his own subjective stance. He moved alone with the spirit of heaven and earth, and did not exalt himself above all things. He did not dispute right and wrong, but sought to live peacefully with the prevalent views.","In the northern darkness there is a fish and his name is K\'un. The K\'un is so huge I don\'t know how many thousand li he measures. He changes and becomes a bird whose name is P\'eng. The back of the P\'eng measures I don\'t know how many thousand li across and, when he rises up and flies off, his wings are like clouds all over the sky. When the sea begins to move, this bird sets off for the southern darkness, which is the Lake of Heaven.The Universal Harmony records various wonders, and it says: \\"When the P\'eng journeys to the southern darkness, the waters are roiled for three thousand li. He beats the whirlwind and rises ninety thousand li, setting off on the sixth month gale.\\" Wavering heat, bits of dust, living things blowing each other about \u2013 the sky looks very blue. Is that its real color, or is it because it is so far away and has no end? When the bird looks down, all he sees is blue too.","The great mass of breath is the wind, yet there are times  when the wind does not move. When it does move,  a myriad of orifices and appendages are aroused to make sounds.  Have you never listened to the sound of the wind in the cavities,  mountains and among the branches of trees?  The wind blows in a thousand different ways,  but each sound is produced in its own way.  What is it that excites all this, and makes each way be itself,  and all these things be self-produced?","All things have different uses.Fine horses can travel a hundred miles a day, But they cannot catch miceLike terriers or weasels:All creatures have gifts of their own.The white horned owl can catch fleas at midnightAnd distinguish the tip of a hair,But in bright day it stares, helpless,And cannot even see a mountain.All things have varying capacities.","Colui che non riesce a trovare spazio per gli altri manca di comprensione, e a chi manca di comprensione tutti risultano estranei.","\u0414\u043e\u0432\u0435\u0440\u0448\u0435\u043d\u0438\u0439 \u0447\u043e\u043b\u043e\u0432\u0456\u043a \u043d\u0435 \u043c\u0430\u0454 \u0441\u0432\u043e\u0433\u043e, \u0431\u043e\u0436\u0438\u0439 \u0447\u043e\u043b\u043e\u0432\u0456\u043a \u043d\u0435 \u043c\u0430\u0454 \u0437\u0430\u0441\u043b\u0443\u0433, \u0430 \u043c\u0443\u0434\u0440\u0435\u0446\u044c \u043d\u0435 \u043c\u0430\u0454 \u0456\u043c\u0435\u043d\u0456.","\u042f\u043a\u043e\u0441\u044c \u0414\u0436\u0432\u0430\u043d\u043e\u0432\u0456 \u0414\u0436\u043e\u0432\u0443 \u043d\u0430\u0441\u043d\u0438\u043b\u043e\u0441\u044f, \u0449\u043e \u0432\u0456\u043d \u043c\u0435\u0442\u0435\u043b\u0438\u043a - \u0436\u0432\u0430\u0432\u0438\u0439 \u043c\u0435\u0442\u0435\u043b\u0438\u043a, \u0449\u043e \u043b\u0456\u0442\u0430\u0454 \u0434\u0435 \u0445\u043e\u0447\u0435 \u0456 \u0437\u043d\u0430\u0442\u0438 \u043d\u0435 \u0437\u043d\u0430\u0454 \u043d\u0456\u044f\u043a\u043e\u0433\u043e \u0414\u0436\u0432\u0430\u043d\u0430. \u041a\u043e\u043b\u0438 \u043f\u0440\u043e\u043a\u0438\u043d\u0443\u0432\u0441\u044f - \u0430\u0436 \u0432\u0456\u043d \u0442\u0430\u043a\u0438 \u0414\u0436\u0432\u0430\u043d. \u0410\u043b\u0435 \u0432\u0456\u043d \u043d\u0435 \u0440\u043e\u0437\u0443\u043c\u0456\u0432, \u0447\u0438 \u0446\u0435 \u0414\u0436\u0432\u0430\u043d\u043e\u0432\u0456 \u043d\u0430\u0441\u043d\u0438\u043b\u043e\u0441\u044f, \u0449\u043e \u0432\u0456\u043d \u043c\u0435\u0442\u0435\u043b\u0438\u043a, \u0447\u0438 \u0446\u0435 \u043c\u0435\u0442\u0435\u043b\u0438\u043a\u0443 \u0434\u043e\u0441\u0456 \u0441\u043d\u0438\u0442\u044c\u0441\u044f, \u0449\u043e \u0432\u0456\u043d \u0414\u0436\u0432\u0430\u043d \u0414\u0436\u043e\u0432? \u0410\u043b\u0435 \u0436 \u043c\u0443\u0441\u044f\u0442\u044c \u0432\u043e\u043d\u0438 \u044f\u043a\u043e\u0441\u044c \u0432\u0456\u0434\u0440\u0456\u0437\u043d\u044f\u0442\u0438\u0441\u044f! \u041e\u0441\u044c \u0449\u043e \u0442\u0430\u043a\u0435 \u043f\u0435\u0440\u0435\u043c\u0456\u043d\u0438 \u0441\u0443\u0449\u043e\u0433\u043e.","The straight tree is the first to be chopped down; the well of sweet water is the first to run dry. Sir, your intention is to display your knowledge in order to astonish the ignorant, and by developing your self, to cast a light upon the crudeness of others.

There are few who can forget success and fame and just return to being ordinary citizens again!

Anonymous, abdicating power, he has no interest in work or fame. So he doesn\u2019t criticize others and they don\u2019t criticize him.
