When he has no respect for anyone, he can no longer love, and, in order to divert himself, having no love in him, he yields to his impulses, indulges in the lowest forms of pleasure, and behaves in the end like an animal. And it all comes from lying - lying to others and to yourself.","The best way to keep a prisoner from escaping is to make sure he never knows he\'s in prison.","Pain and suffering are always inevitable for a large intelligence and a deep heart. The really great men must, I think, have great sadness on earth.","Nothing in this world is harder than speaking the truth, nothing easier than flattery.","It is better to be unhappy and know the worst, than to be happy in a fool\'s paradise.","The darker the night, the brighter the stars, The deeper the grief, the closer is God!","When I look back on my past and think how much time I wasted on nothing, how much time has been lost in futilities, errors, laziness, incapacity to live; how little I appreciated it, how many times I sinned against my heart and soul-then my heart bleeds. Life is a gift, life is happiness, every minute can be an eternity of happiness.","Above all, don\'t lie to yourself.","I gave up caring about anything, and all the problems disappeared.","The most offensive is not their lying - one can always forgive lying - lying is a delightful thing, for it leads to truth - what is offensive is that they lie and worship their own lying.","Love the animals, love the plants, love everything. If you love everything, you will perceive the divine mystery in things. Once you perceive it, you will begin to comprehend it better every day. And you will come at last to love the whole world with an all-embracing love.","You can be sincere and still be stupid.","Life is paradise, and we are all in paradise, but we refuse to see it.","What is hell? I maintain that it is the suffering of being unable to love.","Be not forgetful of prayer. Every time you pray, if your prayer is sincere, there will be new feeling and new meaning in it, which will give you fresh courage, and you will understand that prayer is an education.","People speak sometimes about the \\"bestial\\" cruelty of man, but that is terribly unjust and offensive to beasts, no animal could ever be so cruel as a man, so artfully, so artistically cruel.","Learning to love is hard and we pay dearly for it. It takes hard work and a long apprenticeship, for it is not just for a moment that we must learn to love, but forever.","There is immeasurably more left inside than what comes out in words.","It takes something more than intelligence to act intelligently.","Everything passes, only truth remains.","Totally without hope one cannot live. To live without hope is to cease to live. Hell is hopelessness. It is no accident that above the entrance to Dante\'s hell is the inscription: \\"Leave behind all hope, you who enter here.\\"","If you wish to glimpse inside a human soul and get to know a man ... just watch him laugh. If he laughs well, he\'s a good man.","A society should be judged not by how it treats its outstanding citizens but by how it treats its criminals.","If God does not exist, then everything is permissible.","Hell is the inability to love.","There is no sin , and there can be no sin on all the earth , which the Lord will not forgive to the truly repentant! Man cannot commit a sin so great as to exhaust the infinite love of God . Can there be a sin which could exceed the love of God?","Every blade of grass, every insect, ant, and golden bee, all so amazingly know their path, though they have not intelligence, they bear witness to the mystery of God and continually accomplish it themselves.","To love another person is to see them as God intended them to be.","The greatest happiness is to know the source of unhappiness.","Only through suffering can we find ourselves.","If everything on earth were rational, nothing would happen.","Destroy my desires, eradicate my ideals, show me something better, and I will follow you.","The soul is healed by being with children.","Whoever has experienced the power and the unrestrained ability to humiliate another human being automatically loses his own sensations. Tyranny is a habit, it has its own organic life, it develops finally into a disease. The habit can kill and coarsen the very best man or woman to the level of a beast. Blood and power intoxicate ... the return of the human dignity, repentance and regeneration becomes almost impossible.","Man has it all in his hands, and it all slips through his fingers from sheer cowardice.","I believe the best definition of man is the ungrateful biped.","A hundred suspicions don\'t make a proof.","The more incompetent one feels, the more eager he is to fight.","I think the devil doesn\'t exist, but man has created him, he has created him in his own image and likeness.","I must add... my gratitude to you for the attention with which you have listened to me, for, from my numerous observations, our Liberals are never capable of letting anyone else have a conviction of his own without at once meeting their opponent with abuse or even something worse.","Right attitudes produces right action","The man who lies to himself can be more easily offended than anyone else. You know it is sometimes very pleasant to take offense, isn\'t it? A man may know that nobody has insulted him, but that he has invented the insult for himself, has lied and exaggerated to make it picturesque, has caught at a word and made a mountain out of a molehill--he knows that himself, yet he will be the first to take offense, and will revel in his resentment till he feels great pleasure in it.","If you want to overcome the whole world, overcome yourself.","Love is such a priceless treasure that you can buy the whole world with it, and redeem not only your own but other people\'s sins. Go, and do not be afraid.","I believe there is no one deeper, lovelier, more sympathetic and more perfect than Jesus.","And so I ask myself: \'Where are your dreams?\' And I shake my head and mutter: \'How the years go by!\' And I ask myself again: \'What have you done with those years? Where have you buried your best moments? Have you really lived? Look,\' I say to myself, \'how cold it is becoming all over the world!\' And more years will pass and behind them will creep grim isolation. Tottering senility will come hobbling, leaning on a crutch, and behind these will come unrelieved boredom and despair. The world of fancies will fade, dreams will wilt and die and fall like autumn leaves from the trees. . . .","Sarcasm: the last refuge of modest and chaste-souled people when the privacy of their soul is coarsely and intrusively invaded.","Nothing is easier than to denounce the evildoer; nothing is more difficult than to understand him.","Nature doesn\'t ask your permission; it doesn\'t care about your wishes, or whether you like its laws or not. You\'re obliged to accept it as it is, and consequently all its results as well.","The more you succeed in loving, the more you\'ll be convinced at the existence of God and the immortality of your soul.","Only the heart knows how to find what is precious.","Only one thing matters, one thing; to be able to dare!","The cleverest of all, in my opinion, is the man who calls himself a fool at least once a month.","Above all, don\'t lie to yourself. The man who lies to himself and listens to his own lie comes to a point that he cannot distinguish the truth within him, or around him, and so loses all respect for himself and for others. And having no respect he ceases to love.","Humanity can live without science, it can live without bread, but it cannot live without beauty. Without beauty, there would be nothing left to do in this life. Here the secret lies. Here lies the entire story.","If you want to be respected by others, the great thing is to respect yourself. Only by that, only by self-respect will you compel others to respect you.","You are told a lot about your education, but some beautiful, sacred memory, preserved since childhood, is perhaps the best education of all. If a man carries many such memories into life with him, he is saved for the rest of his days. And even if only one good memory is left in our hearts, it may also be the instrument of our salvation one day.","Man is fond of counting his troubles, but he does not count his joys. If he counted them up as he ought to, he would see that every lot has enough happiness provided for it.","Wealth is the number of things one can do without.","By interpreting freedom as the propagation and immediate gratification of needs, people distort their own nature, for they engender in themselves a multitude of pointless and foolish desires, habits, and incongruous stratagems. Their lives are motivated only by mutual envy, sensuality, and ostentation.","Don\u2019t be overwise; fling yourself straight into life, without deliberation; don\u2019t be afraid - the flood will bear you to the bank and set you safe on your feet again.","The world says: \\"You have needs - satisfy them. You have as much right as the rich and the mighty. Don\'t hesitate to satisfy your needs; indeed, expand your needs and demand more.\\" This is the worldly doctrine of today. And they believe that this is freedom. The result for the rich is isolation and suicide, for the poor, envy and murder.","He who masters the grey everyday is a hero.","To be in love is not the same as loving. You can be in love with a woman and still hate her.","But how could you live and have no story to tell?","You will burn and you will burn out; you will be healed and come back again.","She looked much younger than her age, indeed, which is almost always the case with women who retain serenity of spirit, sensitiveness and pure sincere warmth of heart to old age.","To think too much is a disease.","Be the sun and all will see you.","My friend, the truth is always implausible, did you know that? To make the truth more plausible, it\'s absolutely necessary to mix a bit of falsehood with it. People have always done so.","From a hundred rabbits you can\'t make a horse.","They tease me now, telling me it was only a dream. But does it matter whether it was a dream or reality, if the dream made known to me the truth?","The greater the stupidity, the greater the clarity. Stupidity is brief and guileless, while wit equivocates and hides. Wit is a scoundrel, while stupidity is honest and sincere.","My soul bleeds and the blood steadily, silently, disturbingly slowly, swallows me whole.","The man who is happy is fulfilling the purpose of existence","The world will be saved by beauty.","To love is to suffer and there can be no love otherwise.","At first, art imitates life. Then life will imitate art.Then life will find its very existence from the arts.","It is not the brains that matter most, but that which guides them \u2014 the character, the heart, generous qualities, progressive ideas.","I utter what you would not dare think","What would life be if we had no courage to attempt anything?\\nTaking a new step, uttering a new word, is what people fear most.","If there is no God, then I am God.","In the realist, faith is not born from miracles, but miracles from faith.","And if there\'s love, you can do without happiness too. Even with sorrow, life is sweet.","A real gentleman, even if he loses everything he owns, must show no emotion. Money must be so far beneath a gentleman that it is hardly worth troubling about.","Suffering is part and parcel of extensive intelligence and a feeling heart.","Never mind a little dirt, if the goal is splendid!","Deprived of meaningful work, men and women lose their reason for existence; they go stark, raving mad.","Yes, that\'s right... love should come before logic ... Only then will man come to understand the meaning of life.","Reason and Knowledge have always played a secondary, subordinate, auxiliary role in the life of peoples, and this will always be the case. A people is shaped and driven forward by an entirely different kind of force, one which commands and coerces them and the origin of which is obscure and inexplicable despite the reality of its presence.","If you love everything, you will perceive the divine mystery of things.","And it is so simple... The one thing is - love thy neighbor as thyself - that is the one thing. That is all, nothing else is needed. You will instantly find how to live.","Everything seems stupid when it fails.","Perhaps I really regard myself as an intelligent man only because throughout my entire life I\'ve never been able to start or finish anything.","I don\'t need money, or, better, it\'s not money that I need; it\'s not even power; I need only what is obtained by power and simply cannot be obtained without power: the solitary and calm awareness of strength! That is the fullest definition of freedom, which the world so struggles over!","To go wrong in one\'s own way is better than to go right in someone else\'s.","Love animals: God has given them the rudiments of thought and joy untroubled. Do not trouble their joy, don\'t harrass them, don\'t deprive them of their happiness, don\'t work against God\'s intent. Man, do not pride yourself on superiority to animals; they are without sin, and you, with your greatness, defile the earth by your appearance on it, and leave the traces of your foulness after you - alas, it is true of almost every one of us!","Man, do not pride yourself on your superiority to the animals, for they are without sin, while you, with all your greatness, you defile the earth wherever you appear and leave an ignoble trail behind you -- and that is true, alas, for almost every one of us!","We sometimes encounter people, even perfect strangers, who begin to interest us at first sight, somehow suddenly, all at once, before a word has been spoken.","Lying to ourselves is more deeply ingrained than lying to others.","There are things which a man is afraid to tell even to himself, and every decent man has a number of such things stored away in his mind.","Man is sometimes extraordinarily, passionately, in love with suffering.","Two and two make four. Nature doesn\'t ask your advice. She isn\'t interested in your preferences or whether or not you approve of her laws. You must accept nature as she is with all the consequences that that implies.","Happiness does not lie in happiness, but in the achievement of it.","It seems, in fact, as though the second half of a man\'s life is made up of nothing, but the habits he has accumulated during the first half.","A man who lies to himself, and believes his own lies, becomes unable to recognize truth, either in himself or in anyone else, and he ends up losing respect for himself and for others.","Talking nonsense is man\'s only privilege that distinguishes him from all other organisms.","But I always liked side-paths, little dark back-alleys behind the main road- there one finds adventures and surprises, and precious metal in the dirt.","Truly great men must, I think, experience great sorrow on the earth.","Life is what matters, life alone - the continuous, eternal process of discovering life - and not the discovery itself.","Power is given only to those who dare to lower themselves and pick it up. Only one thing matters, one thing; to be able to dare!","My sweetheart! When I think of you, it\'s as if I\'m holding some healing balm to my sick soul, and although i suffer for you, i find that even suffering for you is easy.","People really do like seeing their best friends humiliated; a large part of the friendship is based on humiliation; and that is an old truth,well known to all intelligent people.","Anyone who can appease a man\'s conscience can take his freedom away from him.","Man has such a predilection for systems and abstract deductions that he is ready to distort the truth intentionally he is ready to deny the evidence of his senses only to justify his logic.","Let us be servants in order to be leaders.","If one wanted to crush and destroy a man entirely, to mete out to him the most terrible punishment, all one would have to do would be to make him do work that was completely and utterly devoid of usefulness and meaning.","Hang your merit. I don\'t seek anyone\'s approbation.","Man only likes to count his troubles, but he does not count his joys.","But men love abstract reasoning and neat systematization so much that they think nothing of distorting the truth, closing their eyes and ears to contrary evidence to preserve their logical constructions.","People with new ideas, people with the faintest capacity for saying something new, are extremely few in number, extraordinarily so, in fact.","Much unhappiness has come into the world because of bewilderment and things left unsaid.","God has such gladness every time he sees from heaven that a sinner is praying to Him with all his heart, as a mother has when she sees the first smile on her baby\'s face.","When reason fails, the devil helps!","I can see the sun, but even if I cannot see the sun, I know that it exists. And to know that the sun is there - that is living.","If God does not exist, everything is permitted.","For all is like an ocean, all flows and connects; touch it in one place and it echoes at the other end of the world.","A single day is sufficient for a man to discover what happiness is.","Loving someone is different from being in love with someone. You can hate someone you\'re in love with","I want to suffer and be purified by suffering!","I tell you, the old-fashioned doctor who treated all diseases has completely disappeared, now there are only specialists, and they advertise all the time in the newspapers. If your nose hurts, they send you to Paris: there\'s a European specialist there, he treats noses. You go to Paris, he examines your nose: I can treat only your right nostril, he says, I don\'t treat left nostrils, it\'s not my specialty, but after me, go to Vienna, there\'s a separate specialist there who will finish treating your left nostril.","To live without Hope is to Cease to live.","We are all happy if we but knew it.","... active love is a harsh and fearful thing compared with the love in dreams. Love in dreams thirsts for immediate action, quickly performed, and with everyone watching. Indeed, it will go as far as the giving even of one\'s life, provided it does not take long but is soon over, as on stage, and eveyone is looking on and praising. Whereas active love is labor and persistence, and for some people, perhaps, a whole science.","You cannot imagine what sorrow and anger seize one\'s whole soul when a great idea, which one has long and piously revered, is picked up by some bunglers and dragged into the street, to more fools like themselves, and one suddenly meets it in the flea market, unrecognizable, dirty, askew, absurdly presented, without proportion, without harmony, a toy for stupid children.","Luxuries are easy to take up but very difficult to give up","My God, a moment of bliss. Why, isn\'t that enough for a whole lifetime?","If not reason, then the devil.","Love children especially, for they too are sinless like the angels; they live to soften and purify our hearts and, as it were, to guide us.","...it all, maybe, most likely, indeed, might turn out for the best.","May you be for ever blessed for that moment of bliss and happiness which you gave to another lonely and grateful heart. Isn\'t such a moment sufficient for the whole of one\'s life?","If you love all things, you will also attain the divine mystery that is in all things. For then your ability to perceive the truth will grow every day, and your mind will open itself to an all-embracing love","Let us not forget that the reasons for human actions are usually incalculably more complex and diverse than we tend to explain them later, and are seldom clearly manifest.","Man is a creature that can get accustomed to anything, and I think that is the best definition of him.","Above all, avoid falsehood, every kind of falsehood, especially falseness to yourself. Watch over your own deceitfulness and look into it every hour, every minute.","Beauty is mysterious as well as terrible. God and devil are fighting there, and the battlefield is the heart of man.","Killing myself was a matter of such indifference to me that I felt like waiting for a moment when it would make some difference.","Taking a new step. . .is what people fear most.","Although your mind works, your heart is darkened with depravity; and without a pure heart there can be no complete and true consciousness","I\'ve long stopped worrying about who invented whom - God man or man God.","There is only one thing that I dread: not to be worthy of my sufferings.","Speak of a wolf and you see his tail!","The death of a child is the greatest reason to doubt the existence of God.","A just cause is not ruined by a few mistakes.","Do you know I don\'t know how one can walk by a tree and not be happy at the sight of it? How can one talk to a man and not be happy in loving him! Oh, it\'s only that I\'m not able to express it...And what beautiful things there are at every step, that even the most hopeless man must feel to be beautiful! Look at a child! Look at God\'s sunrise! Look at the grass, how it grows! Look at the eyes that gaze at you and love you!","To begin with unlimited freedom is to end with unlimited despotism.","Besides, nowadays, almost all capable people are terribly afraid of being ridiculous, and are miserable because of it.","Every man needs a place to go to.","The formula \'Two and two make five\' is not without its attractions.","Every member of the society spies on the rest, and it is his duty to inform against them. All are slaves and equal in their slavery... The great thing about it is equality... Slaves are bound to be equal.","There is immeasurably more left inside than what comes out in words. Your thought, even a bad one, while it is with you, is always more profound, but in words it is more ridiculous and dishonorable.","I swear to you, sirs, that excessive consciousness is a disease--a genuine, absolute disease.","When I look back at the past and think of all the time I squandered in error and idleness,... then my heart bleeds. Life is a gift... every minute could have been an eternity of happiness! If only youth knew! Now my life will change; now I will be reborn.","\'Ever seen a leaf - a leaf from a tree?\' \'Yes.\' I saw one recently - a yellow one, a little green, wilted at the edges. Blown by the wind. When I was a little boy, I used to shut my eyes in winter and imagine a green leaf, with veins on it, and the sun shining ...\' \'What\'s this - an allegory?\' \\"No; why? Not an allegory - a leaf, just a leaf. A leaf is good. Everything\'s good.\'","Believe to the end, even if all men went astray and you were left the only one faithful; bring your offering even then and praise God in your loneliness.","I am a fool with a heart but no brains, and you are a fool with brains but no heart; and we\u2019re both unhappy, and we both suffer.","My life is ending, I know that well, but every day that is left me I feel how my earthly life is in touch with a new infinite, unknown, but approaching life, the nearness of which sets my soul quivering with rapture, my mind glowing and my heart weeping with joy.","Obedience, fasting, and prayer are laughed at, yet only through them lies the way to real true freedom. I cut off my superfluous and unnecessary desires, I subdue my proud and wanton will and chastise it with obedience, and with God\'s help I attain freedom of spirit and with it spiritual joy.","I cannot truly imagine a truly great person who hasn\'t suffered.","There is, indeed, nothing more annoying than to be, for instance, wealthy, of good family, nice-looking, fairly intelligent, and even good-natured, and yet to have no talents, no special faculty, no peculiarity even, not one idea of one\'s own, to be precisely \\"like other people.","You are told a lot about your education, but some beautiful, sacred memory, preserved since childhood, is perhaps the best education of all.","Remember, too, every day, and whenever you can, repeat to yourself, Lord, have mercy on all who appear before Thee today. For every hour and every moment thousands of men leave life on this earth, and their souls appear before God. And how many of them depart in solitude, unknown, sad, dejected that no one mourns for them or even knows whether they have lived or not!","Love in action is a harsh and dreadful thing compared with love in dreams.","Intelligence alone is not nearly enough when it comes to acting wisely.","They were renewed by love; the heart of each held infinite sources of life for the heart of the other.","I am alone, I thought, and they are everybody.","Men do not accept their prophets and slay them, but they love their martyrs and worship those whom they have tortured to death.","I am a dreamer. I know so little of real life that I just can\u2019t help re-living such moments as these in my dreams, for such moments are something I have very rarely experienced. I am going to dream about you the whole night, the whole week, the whole year.","For broad understanding and deep feeling, you need pain and suffering.","Love the animals: God has given them the rudiments of thought and joy untroubled.","It is amazing what one ray of sunshine can do for a man!","A fool with a heart and no sense is just as unhappy as a fool with sense and no heart.","Man is bound to lie about himself","Since I wasn\'t consulted at the time of the creation of the world, I reserve for myself the right to have my own opinion about it.","The secret of man\'s being is not only to live but to have something to live for.","We do not understand that life is paradise, for it suffices only to wish to understand it, and at once paradise will appear in front of us in its beauty.","Above all, avoid lies, all lies, especially the lie to yourself. Keep watch on your own lie and examine it every hour, every minute. And avoid contempt, both of others and of yourself: what seems bad to you in yourself is purified by the very fact that you have noticed it in yourself. And avoid fear, though fear is simply the consequence of every lie. Never be frightened at your own faintheartedness in attaining love, and meanwhile do not even be very frightened by your own bad acts.","Realists do not fear the results of their study.","Nothing is more seductive for a man than his freedom of conscience, but nothing is a greater cause of suffering.","The consciousness of life is higher than life.","For what is man without desires, without free will, and without the power of choice but a stop in an organ pipe?","Just take a look around you: Blood is flowing in rivers and in such a jolly way you\u2019d think it was champagne.","In sinning, each man sins against all, and each man is at least partly guilt for another\'s sin. There is no isolated sin.","To study the meaning of man and of life \u2014 I am making significant progress here. I have faith in myself. Man is a mystery: if you spend your entire life trying to puzzle it out, then do not say that you have wasted your time. I occupy myself with this mystery, because I want to be a man.","To achieve perfection, one must first begin by not understanding many things! And if we understand too quickly, we may not understand well.","There is nothing higher and stronger and more wholesome and useful for life in later years than some good memory, especially a memory connected with childhood, with home.","One can know a man from his laugh, and if you like a man\'s laugh before you know anything of him, you may confidently say that he is a good man.","Happiness lies not in happiness but only in the attempt to achieve it.","If he has a conscience he will suffer for his mistake. That will be his punishment-as well as the prison.","What man wants is simply independent choice, whatever that independence may cost and wherever it may lead.","I drink because I wish to multiply my sufferings.","Faith does not, in the realist, spring from the miracle but the miracle from the faith.","I swear to you gentlemen, that to be overly conscious is a sickness, a real, thorough sickness.","He was one of the numerous and varied legion of dullards, of half-animated abortions, conceited, half-educated coxcombs, who attach themselves to the idea most in fashion only to vulgarize it and who caricature every cause they serve, however sincerely.","Compassion is the chief law of human existence.","The enemies of living life; outdated little liberals, afraid of their own independence; lackeys of thought, enemies of the person and freedom, decrepit preachers of carrion and rot! What do they have: gray heads, the golden mean, the most abject and philistine giftlessness, envious equality, equality without personal dignity, equality as understood by a lackey or a Frenchman of the year ninety-three...And scoundrells, above all, scoundrels, scoundrels everywhere!","Love all God\u2019s creation, both the whole and every grain of sand. Love every leaf, every ray of light. Love the animals, love the plants, love each separate thing. If thou love each thing thou wilt perceive the mystery of God in all; and when once thou perceive this, thou wilt thenceforward grow every day to a fuller understanding of it: until thou come at last to love the whole world with a love that will then be all-embracing and universal.","Drive nature out of the door and it will fly in at the window","Grown-up people do not know that a child can give exceedingly good advice even in the most difficult case.","The jealous are the readiest of all to forgive, and all women know it.","This is my last message to you: in sorrow, seek happiness.","Power is given only to him who dares to stoop and take it ... one must have the courage to dare.","One can tell a child everything, anything. I have often been struck by the fact that parents know their children so little. They should not conceal so much from them. How well even little children understand that their parents conceal things from them, because they consider them too young to understand! Children are capable of giving advice in the most important matters.","There is only one way to salvation, and that is to make yourself responsible for all men\'s sins. As soon as you make yourself responsible in all sincerity for everything and for everyone, you will see at once that this is really so, and that you are in fact to blame for everyone and for all things.","The more I love humanity in general, the less I love man in particular.","Through error you come to the truth! I am a man because I err! You never reach any truth without making fourteen mistakes and very likely a hundred and fourteen.","How good life is when one does something good and just!","The prince says that the world will be saved by beauty! And I maintain that the reason he has such playful ideas is that he is in love.","Neither man nor nation can exist without a sublime idea.","You know, my boy, he said, it\'s impossible to love men such as they are. And yet we must. So try to do good to men by doing violence to your feelings, holding your nose, and shutting your eyes, especially shutting your eyes. Endure their villainy without anger, as much as possible; try to remember that you\'re a man too. For, if you\'re even a little above average intelligence, you\'ll have the propensity to judge people severely. Men are vile by nature and they\'d rather love out of fear. Don\'t give in to such love: despise it always.","It is precisely that requirement of shared worship that has been the principal source of suffering for individual man and the human race since the beginning of history. In their efforts to impose universal worship, men have unsheathed their swords and killed one another. They have invented gods and challenged each other: \\"Discard your gods and worship mine or I will destroy both your gods and you!\\"","All people seem to be divided into\'ordinary\'and \'extraordinary\'. The ordinary people must lead a life of strict obedience and have no right to transgress the law because?theyare ordinary.Whereas the extraordinary people have the right to commit any crime they like and transgress the law in any way just because they happen to be extraordinary.","The degree of civilization in a society can be judged by entering its prisons.","So long as man remains free he strives for nothing so incessantly and so painfully as to find someone to worship.","Men like to to count their troubles; few calculate their happiness.","Every man looks out for himself, and he has the happiest life who manages to hoodwink himself best of all.","Was it all put into words, or did both understand that they had the same thing at heart and in their minds, so that there was no need to speak of it aloud, and better not to speak of it?","Don\u2019t let us forget that the causes of human actions are usually immeasurably more complex and varied than our subsequent explanations of them.","The man who lies to himself and listens to his own lie comes to such a pass that he cannot distinguish the truth within him.","a man is no example for a woman. It\u2019s a different thing.","Man is a pliable animal, a being who gets accustomed to everything!","We must never forget that human motives are generally far more complicated than we are apt to suppose, and that we can very rarely accurately describe the motives of another.","If you can put the question, \'Am I or am I not responsible for my acts?\' then you are responsible.","The world stands on absurdities, and without them perhaps nothing at all would happen.","Know that I\'ve forgotten precisely nothing; but I\'ve driven it all out of my head for a time, even the memories--until I\'ve radically improved my circumstances. Then...then you\'ll see, I\'ll rise from the dead!","Being in love doesn\'t mean loving.","But it is possible, it is possible: the old grief, by a great mystery of human life, gradually passes into quiet, tender joy; instead of young, ebullient blood comes a mild, serene old age: I bless the sun\'s rising each day and my heart sings to it as before, but now I love its setting even more, its long slanting rays, and with them quiet, mild, tender memories, dear images from the whole of a long and blessed life--and over all is God\'s truth, moving, reconciling, all-forgiving!","Man grows used to everything, the scoundrel!","When he has lost all hope, all object in life, man becomes a monster in his misery.","They were like two enemies in love with one another.","A new philosophy, a new way of life, is not given for nothing. It has to be paid dearly for and only acquired with much patience and great effort","At some thoughts one stands perplexed, especially at the sight of men\'s sin, and wonders whether one should use force or humble love. Always decide to use humble love. If you resolve on that once for all, you may subdue the whole world.","Dreams seem to be spurred on not by reason but by desire, not by the head but by the heart, and yet what complicated tricks my reason has played sometimes in dreams.","A true friend of mankind whose heart has but once quivered in compassion over the sufferings of the people, will understand and forgive all the impassable alluvial filth in which they are submerged, and will be able to discover the diamonds in the filth.","Love a man, even in his sin, for that love is a likeness of the divine love, and is the summit of love on earth.","For, after all, you do grow up, you do outgrow your ideals, which turn to dust and ashes, which are shattered into fragments; and if you have no other life, you just have to build one up out of these fragments.","Paradise is hidden in each one of use, it is concealed within me too, right now, and if I wish, it will come for me in reality, tomorrow even, and for the rest of my life.","Existentialism isn\'t so atheistic that it wears itself out showing that God doesn\'t exist. Rather, it declares that even if God did exist, that would change nothing.","If man has one good memory to go by, that may be enough to save him.","The more I detest men individually the more ardent becomes my love for humanity.","There is nothing easier than lopping off heads and nothing harder than developing ideas.","Power is only vouchsafed to the man who dares to stoop and pick it up. There is only one thing, one thing needful: one has only to dare!","If I seem happy to you . . . You could never say anything that would please me more. For men are made for happiness, and anyone who is completely happy has a right to say to himself, \'I am doing God\'s will on earth.\' All the righteous, all the saints, all the holy martyrs were happy.","I have no self-respect. But can a man of acute sensibility respect himself at all?","Do you think it is a vain hope that one day man will find joy in noble deeds of light and mercy, rather than in the coarse pleasures he indulges in today -- gluttony, fornication, ostentation, boasting, and envious vying with his neighbor? I am certain this is not a vain hope and that the day will come soon.","Lack of originality, everywhere, all over the world, from time immemorial, has always been considered the foremost quality and the recommendation of the active, efficient and practical man.","It sometimes happened that you might be familiar with a man for several years thinking he was a wild animal, and you would regard him with contempt. And then suddenly a moment would arrive when some uncontrollable impulse would lay his soul bare, and you would behold in it such riches, such sensitivity and warmth, such a vivid awareness of its own suffering and the suffering of others, that the scales would fall from your eyes and at first you would hardly be able to believe what you had seen and heard. The reverse also happens.","One must love life before loving its meaning ... yes, and when the love of life disappears, no meaning can console us.","Civilization merely develops man\'s capacity for a greater variety of sensations, and ... absolutely nothing else.","A man would still do something out of sheer perversity - he would create destruction and chaos - just to gain his point...and if all this could in turn be analyzed and prevented by predicting that it would occur, then man would deliberately go mad to prove his point.","With love one can live even without happiness.","Reality is infinitely diverse, compared with even the subtlest conclusions of abstract thought, and does not allow of clear-cut and sweeping distinctions. Reality resists classification.","And what\'s strange, what would be marvelous, is not that God should really exist; the marvel is that such an idea, the idea of the necessity of God, could enter the head of such a savage, vicious beast as man.","Viper will eat viper, and it would serve them both right!","It is a law of nature that every decent man on earth is bound to be a coward and a slave","--you wouldn\'t have hurt me like this for nothing. So what have I done? How have I wronged you? Tell me.","Times of crisis, of disruption or constructive change, are not only predictable, but desirable. They mean growth. Taking a new step, uttering a new word, is what people fear most.","I\'m drunk but truthful.","I agree that two times two makes four is an excellent thing; but if we are dispensing praise, then two times two makes five is sometimes a most charming little thing as well.","Reason is the slave of passion.","It suddenly seemed to me that I was lonely, that every one was forsaking me and going away from me. Of course, any one is entitled to ask who \\"every one\\" was. For though I had been living almost eight years in Petersburg I had hardly an acquaintance. But what did I want with acquaintances? I was acquainted with all Petersburg as it was.","They have succeeded in accumulating a greater mass of objects, but the joy in the world has grown less.","For a woman, all resurrection, all salvation, from whatever perdition, lies in love; in fact, it is her only way to it.","The meanest and most hateful thing about money is that it even gives one talent.","It is not as a child that I believe and confess Jesus Christ. My hosanna is born of a furnace of doubt.","What terrible tragedies realism inflicts on people.","The whole work of man really seems to consist in nothing but proving to himself every minute that he is a man and not a piano key.","Neither a person nor a nation can exist without some higher idea. And there is only one higher idea on earth, and it is the idea of the immortality of the human soul, for all other \\"higher\\" ideas of life by which humans might live derive from that idea alone.","Russians alone are able to combine so many opposites in themselves at one and the same time.","There is nothing in the world more difficult than candor, and nothing easier than flattery. If there is a hundredth of a fraction of a false note to candor, it immediately produces dissonance, and as a result, exposure. But in flattery, even if everything is false down to the last note, it is still pleasant, and people will listen not without pleasure; with coarse pleasure, perhaps, but pleasure nevertheless.","What is hell?...The suffering that comes from the consciousness that one is no longer able to love.","My God, but what do I care about the laws of nature and arithmatic if for some reason these laws and two times two is four are not to my liking?","Love is a teacher, but one must know how to acquire it, for it is difficult to acquire, it is dearly bought, by long work over a long time, for one ought to love not for a chance moment but for all time. Anyone, even a wicked man, can love by chance.","I do not rebel against my God, I simply do not accept his world.","In order to love simply, it is necessary to know how to show love.","The world has proclaimed the reign of freedom, especially of late, but what do we see in this freedom of theirs? Nothing but slavery and self-destruction! For the world says: \\"You have desires and so satisfy them, for you have the same rights as the most rich and powerful. Don\'t be afraid of satisfying them and even multiply your desires.\\"","I don\u2019t understand anything...and I no longer want to understand anything. I want to stick to the fact...If I wanted to understand something, I would immediately have to betray the fact, but I\u2019ve made up my mind to stick to the fact.","Lamentations comfort only by lacerating the heart still more. Such grief does not desire consolation. It feeds on the sense of its hopelessness. Lamentations spring only from the constant craving to re-open the wound.","Woe to the man who offends a small child!","We have all lost touch with life, we all limp, each to a greater or lesser degree.","If there were no God, he would have to be invented.","Nothing has ever been more insupportable for a man and a human society than freedom. \u2013The Grand Inquisitor","A beast can never be as cruel as a human being, so artistically, so picturesquely cruel.","I\'ve always considered myself smarter than everyone around me, and sometimes, believe me, I\'ve been ashamed of it. At the least, all my life I\'ve looked away and never could look people straight in the eye.","If you are penitent, you love. And if you love you are of God. All things are atoned for, all things are saved by love. If I, a sinner even as you are, am tender with you and have pity on you, how much more will God have pity upon you. Love is such a priceless treasure that you can redeem the whole world by it, and cleanse not only your own sins but the sins of others.","Bad people are to be found everywhere, but even among the worst there may be something good.","There are chance meetings with strangers that interest us from the first moment, before a word is spoken.","Existence alone had never been enough for him; he had always wanted more. Perhaps it was only from the force of his desires that he had regarded himself as a man to whom more was permitted than to others.","There is no subject so old that something new cannot be said about it.","If you wish to glimpse inside a human soul and get to know a man, don\'t bother analyzing his ways of being silent, of talking, of weeping, of seeing how much he is moved by noble ideas; you will get better results if you just watch him laugh. If he laughs well, he\'s a good man.","Shower on him every blessing, drown him in a sea of happiness, give him economic prosperity such that he should have nothing else to do but sleep, eat cakes, and busy himself with the continuation of the species, and even then, out of sheer ingratitude, sheer spite, man would play you some nasty trick.","To be acutely conscious is a disease, a real, honest-to-goodness disease.","It\'s the great mystery of human life that old grief passes gradually into quiet tender joy.","No, evidently habit means a lot. The devil knows what habit can do to a person.","A cultivated and decent man cannot be vain without setting a fearfully high standard for himself, and without despising and almost hating himself at certain moments.","There is no explaining anything by reasoning and so it is useless to reason.","One must first learn to live oneself before one blames others.","In most cases, people, even wicked people, are far more naive and simple-hearted than one generally assumes. And so are we.","And though I suffer for you, yet it eases my heart to suffer for you.","Sorrow compressed my heart, and I felt I would die, and then... Well, then I woke up.","Atheism: It seeks to replace in itself the moral power of religion, in order to appease the spiritual thirst of parched humanity and save it; not by Christ, but by force.","You see, gentlemen, reason is an excellent thing, there\u2019s no disputing that, but reason is nothing but reason and satisfies only the rational side of man\u2019s nature, while will is a manifestation of the whole life, that is, of the whole human life including reason and all the impulses. And although our life, in this manifestation of it, is often worthless, yet it is life and not simply extracting square roots.","There were moments when I hated everybody I came across, innocent or guilty, and looked at them as thieves who were robbing me of my life with impunity. The most unbearable misfortune is when you yourself become unjust, malignant, vile; you realize it, you even reproach yourself - but you just can\'t help it.","I am a wicked man... But do you know, gentlemen, what was the main point about my wickedness? The whole thing, precisely was, the greatest nastiness precisely lay in my being shamefully conscious every moment, even in moments of the greatest bile, that I was not only not a wicked man but was not even an embittered man, that I was simply frightening sparrows in vain, and pleasing myself with it.","Forgive me... for my love -for ruining you with my love.","They wanted to speak, but could not; tears stood in their eyes. They were both pale and thin; but those sick pale faces were bright with the dawn of a new future, of a full resurrection into a new life. They were renewed by love; the heart of each held infinite sources of life for the heart of the other.","Civilization has made man, if not always more bloodthirsty, at least more viciously, more horribly bloodthirsty.","Then Christ will say to us, \'Come you also! Come you drunkards! Come you weaklings! Come you depraved!\' And he will say to us, \'Vile creatures, you in the image of the beast and you who bear his mark. All the same, you come too!\' And the wise and prudent will say, \'Lord, why are you welcoming them? And he will say, \'O wise and prudent, I am welcoming them because not one of them has ever judged himself worthy. And he will stretch out his arms to us, and we shall fall at his feet, and burst into sobs, and then we shall understand everything, everything! Lord, your kingdom come!","I do not wish you much happiness--it would bore you; I do not wish you trouble either; but, following the people\'s philosophy, I will simply repeat: \'Live more\' and try somehow not to be too bored; this useless wish I am adding on my own.","Of course my jokes are in poor taste, inappropriate, and confused; they reveal my lack of security. But that is because I have no respect for myself.","To kill someone for committing murder is a punishment incomparably worse than the crime itself. Murder by legal sentence is immeasurably more terrible than murder by brigands.","Yet, I didn\'t understand that she was intentionally disguising her feelings with sarcasm; that was usually the last resort of people who are timid and chaste of heart, whose souls have been coarsely and impudently invaded; and who, until the last moment, refuse to yield out of pride and are afraid to express their own feelings to you.","Gentlemen, let us suppose that man is not stupid. (Indeed one cannot refuse to suppose that, if only from the one consideration, that, if man is stupid, then who is wise?) But if he is not stupid, he is monstrously ungrateful! Phenomenally ungrateful. In fact, I believe that the best definition of man is the ungrateful biped.","Perhaps a normal man is supposed to be stupid-how do we know? Perhaps it\'s even very beautiful.","I may be mistaken but it seems to me that a man may be judged by his laugh, and that if at first encounter you like the laugh of a person completely unknown to you, you may say with assurance that he is good.","For the secret of man\'s being is not only to live but to have something to live for. Without a stable conception of the object of life, man would not consent to go on living, and would rather destroy himself than remain on earth, though he had bread in abundance.","Above all, do not lie to yourself.","The essence of religious feeling does not come under any sort of reasoning or atheism, and has nothing to do with any crimes or misdemeanors. There is something else here, and there will always be something else - something that the atheists will for ever slur over; they will always be talking of something else.","The man who has a conscience suffers whilst acknowledging his sin. That is his punishment.","I am strongly convinced that not only too much consciousness but even any consciousness at all is a sickness.","Life is in ourselves and not in the external.","We always imagine eternity as something beyond our conception, something vast, vast! But why must it be vast?","An artist must know the reality he is depicting in its minutest detail. In my opinion we have only one shining example of that - Count Leo Tolstoy.","Brother, I\u2019m not depressed and haven\u2019t lost spirit. Life everywhere is life, life is in ourselves and not in the external. There will be people near me, and to be a human being among human beings, and remain one forever, no matter what misfortunes befall, not to become depressed, and not to falter \u2013 this is what life is, herein lies its task.","Lying is a delightful thing, for it leads to truth.","Life [had] replaced logic.","Drowning men, it is said, cling to wisps of straw.","originality and a feeling of one\'s own dignity are achieved only through work and struggle.","There is something at the bottom of every new human thought, every thought of genius, or even every earnest thought that springs up in any brain, which can never be communicated to others, even if one were to write volumes about it and were explaining one\'s idea for thirty-five years; there\'s something left which cannot be induced to emerge from your brain, and remains with you forever; and with it you will die, without communicating to anyone perhaps the most important of your ideas.","Love life more than the meaning of it?","Oh I\'ve plenty of time, my time is entirely my own.","But what are years, what are months!\\" he would exclaim. \\"Why count the days, when even one day is enough for man to know all happiness.","The perpetration of a crime is accompanied by illness!","God is necessary, and therefore must exist...But I know that he does not and cannot exist...Don\'t you understand that a man with these two thoughts cannot go on living?","To cook your hare you must first catch it.","One can fall in love and still hate.","Since man cannot live without miracles, he will provide himself with miracles of his own making. He will believe in witchcraft and sorcery, even though he may otherwise be a heretic, an atheist, and a rebel.","You sensed that you should be following a different path, a more ambitious one, you felt that you were destined for other things but you had no idea how to achieve them and in your misery you began to hate everything around you.","It\'s not miracles that generate faith, but faith that generates miracles.","Homeopathic doses are perhaps the strongest.","I almost do not exist now and I know it; God knows what lives in me in place of me.","Right or wrong, it\'s very pleasant to break something from time to time.","If the spirit has passed through a great many sensations, possibly it can no longer be sated with them, but grows more excited, and demands more sensations, and stronger and stronger ones, until at length it falls exhausted.","That\'s just the point: an honest and sensitive man opens his heart, and the man of business goes on eating - and then he eats you up.","You will have many enemies, but even your foes will love you. Life will bring you many misfortunes, but you will find your happiness in them, and will bless life and will make others bless it-which is what matters most.","There is not a thing that is more positive than bread.","There is no idea, no fact, which could not be vulgarized and presented in a ludicrous light.","Though I do not believe in the order of things, still the sticky little leaves that come out in the spring are dear to me, the blue sky is dear to me, some people are dear to me, whom one loves sometimes, would you believe it, without even knowing why; some human deeds are dear to me, which one has perhaps long ceased believing in, but still honors with one\'s heart, out of old habit...\\" --Ivan Karamazov","They won\'t let me ... I can\'t be ... good!","One man doesn\'t believe in god at all, while the other believes in him so thoroughly that he prays as he murders men!","Love every leaf, every ray of light. Love the animals, love the plants, love each separate thing. Loving all, you will perceive the mystery of God in all.","If you were to destroy the belief in immortality in mankind, not only love but every living force on which the continuation of all life in the world depended, would dry up at once.","There is no object on earth which cannot be looked at from a cosmic point of view.","Is it really not possible to touch the gaming table without being instantly infected by superstition?","Faith does not, in the realist, spring from the miracle but the miracle from faith. If the realist once believes, then he is bound by his very realism to admit the miraculous also.","Inventors and geniuses have almost always been looked on as no better than fools at the beginning of their career, and very frequently at the end of it also.","Because I\'m a Karamazov. Because when I fall into the abyss, I go straight into it, head down and heels up, and I\'m even pleased that I\'m falling in just such a humiliating position, and for me I find it beautiful.","Only to live, to live and live! Life, whatever it may be!","- What is a Socialist? - That\'s when all are equal and all have property in common, there are no marriages, and everyone has any religion and laws he likes best. You are not old enough to understand that yet.","Talking nonsense is the sole privilege mankind possesses over the other organisms. It\'s by talking nonsense that one gets to the truth! I talk nonsense, therefore I\'m human","... the more I learned, the more conscious did I become of the fact that I was ridiculous. So that for me my years of hard work at the university seem in the end to have existed for the sole purpose of demonstrating and proving to me, the more deeply engrossed I became in my studies, that I was an utterly absurd person","Human laziness makes people pigeonhole one another at first site so that they find nothing in common with one another.","The Russian soul is a dark place.","Can a man possessing conciousness ever really respect himself?","Being at a loss to resolve these questions, I am resolved to leave them without any resolution.","Money is coined liberty, and so it is ten times dearer to a man who is deprived of freedom. If money is jingling in his pocket, he is half consoled, even though he cannot spend it.","But man is a fickle and disreputable creature and perhaps, like a chess-player, is interested in the process of attaining his goal rather than the goal itself.","I am too young and I\'ve loved you too much.","Beggars, especially noble beggars, should never show themselves in the street; they should ask for alms through the newspapers. It\'s still possible to love one\'s neighbor abstractly, and even occasionally from a distance, but hardly ever up close.","In summer, intolerable closeness; in winter, unendurable cold. All the floors were rotten. Filth on the floors an inch thick; one could slip and fall.","Even those who have renounced Christianity and attack it, in their inmost being still follow the Christian ideal, for hitherto neither their subtlety nor the ardour of their hearts has been able to create a higher ideal of man and of virtue than the ideal given by Christ of old.","Every man has some reminiscences which he would not tell to everyone, but only to his friends. He has others which he would not reveal even to his friends, but only to himself, and that in secret. But finally there are still others which a man is even afraid to tell himself, and every decent man has a considerable number of such things stored away. That is, one can even say that the more decent he is, the greater the number of such things in his mind.","It\'s in despair that you find the sharpest pleasures, particularly when you are most acutely aware of the hopelessness of your position.","I have a plan-to go mad.","Humiliate the reason and distort the soul.","To crush, to annihilate a man utterly, to inflict on him the most terrible of punishments so that the most ferocious murderer would shudder at it and dread it beforehand, one need only give him work of an absolutely, completely useless and irrational character.","You must accept it as it is, and hence accept all consequences. A wall is indeed a wall.","Fathers, provoke not your children to wrath.","There is nothing more alluring to man than freedom of conscience, but neither is there anything more agonizing.","Man is tormented by no greater anxiety than to find someone quickly to whom he can hand over that great gift of freedom with which the ill-fated creature is born.","I am crazy about mysterious things.","If you happen to have a wart on your nose or forehead, you cannot help imagining that no one in the world has anything else to do but stare at your wart, laugh at it, and condemn you for it, even though you have discovered America.","Such power!\\" Adelaida cried all at once, peering greedily at the portrait over her sister\'s shoulder. \\"Where? What power?\\" Lizaveta Prokofyevna asked sharply. \\"Such beauty has power,\\" Adelaida said hotly. \\"You can overturn the world with such beauty.","Break what must be broken, once for all, that\'s all, and take the suffering on oneself.","The more stupid one is, the closer one is to reality. The more stupid one is, the clearer one is. Stupidity is brief and artless, while intelligence squirms and hides itself. Intelligence is unprincipled, but stupidity is honest and straightforward.","It was a wonderful night, such a night as is only possible when we are young, dear reader.","Let it not be a beautiful face,\' I thought, \'but to make up for that, let it be a noble, an expressive, and, above all, an extremely intelligent one.","Without a clear perception of his reasons for living, man will never consent to live, and will rather destroy himself than tarry on earth, though he be surrounded with bread\\".","My friends, God is necessary for me if only because he is the one being who can be loved eternally.","Whether one showed you and execution or a little finger, you would extract an equally edifying thought from both of them, and would still be content. That\'s the way to get on in life.","But to fall in love does not mean to love. One can fall in love and still hate.","I am a sick man...I am a spiteful man. I am a most unpleasant man.","Only by self-respect will you compel others to respect you.","I am told that the proximity of punishment arouses real repentance in the criminal and sometimes awakens a feeling of genuine remorse in the most hardened heart; I am told this is due to fear.","In such situations, of course, people don\'t nurse their anger silently, they moan aloud; but these are not frank, straightforward moans, there is a kind of cunning malice in them, and that\'s the whole point. Those very moans express the sufferer\'s delectation; if he did not enjoy his moans, he wouldn\'t be moaning.","There are three forces, the only three forces capable of conquering and enslaving forever the conscience of these weak rebels in the interests of their own happiness.  They are: the miracle, the mystery and authority.","You ache with it all; and the more mysterious it is, the more you ache.","It\u2019s not God that I do not accept, you understand, it is this world of God\u2019s, created by God, that I do not accept and cannot agree to accept.","From harmony, from heavenly harmony, This universal frame began: From harmony to harmony Through all the compass of the notes it ran, The diapason closing full in Man.","Beauty would save the world.","Sometimes we desire absolute nonsense because in our stupidity we see in this nonsense the easiest way of attaining some conjectural good.","Catch several hares and you won\'t catch one.","All of a sudden I became aware of a little star in one of those patches and I began looking at it intently. That was because the little star gave me an idea: I made up my mind to kill myself that night. I had made up my mind to kill myself already two months before and, poor as I am, I bought myself an excellent revolver and loaded it the same day. But two months had elapsed and it was still lying in the drawer. I was so utterly indifferent to everything that I was anxious to wait for the moment when I would not be so indifferent and then kill myself. Why -- I don\'t know.",". . . finally, I couldn\'t imagine how I could live without books, and I stopped dreaming about marrying that Chinese prince. . . .","if she had ordered me to throw myself down then, I would have done it! If she had said it only as a joke, said it with contempt, spitting on me--even then I would have jumped!","It seemed clear to me that life and the world somehow depended upon me now. I may almost say that the world now seemed created for me alone: if I shot myself the world would cease to be at least for me. I say nothing of its being likely that nothing will exist for anyone when I am gone, and that as soon as my consciousness is extinguished the whole world will vanish too and become void like a phantom , as a mere appurtenance of my consciousness, for possibly all this world and all these people are only me myself.","I did not bow down to you, I bowed down to all the suffering of humanity.","To a commonplace man of limited intellect, for instance, nothing is simpler than to imagine himself an original character, and to revel in that belief without the slightest misgiving.","For I love the empress of my soul. I love and I cannot but love. You yourself see the whole of me. I shall fly to her, fall down before her: you were right to walk past me.. farewell and forget your victim, never trouble yourself more!","What can become of him if he is in such bondage to the habit of satisfying the innumerable desires he has created for himself? He is isolated, and what concern has he with the rest of humanity? They have succeeded in accumulating a greater mass of objects, but the joy in the world has grown less.","And, indeed, I will at this point ask an idle question on my own account: which is better \u2014 cheap happiness or exalted sufferings? Well, which is better?","Beyond the grave they will find nothing but death. But we shall keep the secret, and for their happiness we shall allure them with the reward of heaven and eternity.","It\'s in the homes of spiteful old widows that one finds such cleanliness.","To strive consciously for an object and to engage in engineering -- that is, incessantly and eternally to make new roads, wherever they may lead.","Until you have become really, in actual fact, as brother to everyone, brotherhood will not come to pass.","I will put up with any mockery rather than pretend that I am satisfied when I am hungry.","All the Utopias will come to pass only when we grow wings and all people are converted into angels.","We don\'t understand that life is heaven, for we have only to understand that and it will at once be fulfilled in all its beauty, we shall embrace each other and weep.","Schoolboys are a merciless race, individually they are angels, but together, especially in schools, they are often merciless.","Beauty is a terrible and awful thing! It is terrible because it has not been fathomed, for God sets us nothing but riddles. Here the boundaries meet and all contradictions exist side by side.","I gave up caring about anything, and all the problems disappeared. And it was after that that I found out the truth . I learnt the truth last November on the third of November, to be precise and I remember every instant since.","We all come out from Gogol\'s \'Overcoat\'.","It is not possible to eat me without insisting that I sing praises of my devourer?","Psychology lures even most serious people into romancing, and quite unconsciously.","There is no virtue if there is no immortality.","If it were considered desirable to destroy a human being, the only thing necessary would be to give his work a character of uselessness","Equality lies only in human moral dignity. ... Let there be brothers first, then there will be brotherhood, and only then will there be a fair sharing of goods among brothers.","You see I kept asking myself then: why am I so stupid that if others are stupid\u2014and I know they are\u2014yet I won\'t be wiser?","I think that if one is faced by inevitable destruction -- if a house is falling upon you, for instance -- one must feel a great longing to sit down, close one\'s eyes and wait, come what may . . .","Money is coined liberty.","The genuine realist, if he is an unbeliever, will always find strength and ability to disbelieve in the miraculous, and if he is confronted with a miracle as an irrefutable fact he would rather disbelieve his own senses than admit the miraculous also.","He walked on without resting. He had a terrible longing for some distraction, but he did not know what to do, what to attempt. A new overwhelming sensation was gaining more and more mastery over him every moment; this was an immeasurable, almost physical, repulsion for everything surrounding him, an obstinate, malignant feeling of hatred. All who met him were loathsome to him - he loathed their faces, their movements, their gestures. If anyone had addressed him, he felt that he might have spat at him or bitten him... .","I wanted to fathom her secrets; I wanted her to come to me and say: \\"I love you,\\" and if not that, if that was senseless insanity, then...well, what was there to care about? Did I know what I wanted? I was like one demented: all I wanted was to be near her, in the halo of her glory, in her radiance, always, for ever, all my life. I knew nothing more!","We\'re always thinking of eternity as an idea that cannot be understood, something immense. But why must it be? What if, instead of all this, you suddenly find just a little room there, something like a village bath-house, grimy, and spiders in every corner, and that\'s all eternity is. Sometimes, you know, I can\'t help feeling that that\'s what it is.","God knows what lives in me in place of me.","I must have justice, or I will destroy myself. And not justice in some remote and infinite time and space, but here on Earth...I want to see with my own eyes the lamb lie down with the lion and the victim rise up and embrace his murderer. I want to be there when everyone suddenly understands what it has all been about. All the religions of the world are built on this longing, and I am a believer.","...to return to their \'native soil,\' as they say, to the bosom, so to speak, of their mother earth, like frightened children, yearning to fall asleep on the withered bosom of their decrepit mother, and to sleep there for ever, only to escape the horrors that terrify them.","At such times I felt something was drawing me away, and I kept fancying that if I walked straight on, far, far away and reached that line where the sky and earth meet, there I should find the key to the mystery, there I should see a new life a thousand times richer and more turbulent than ours.","Man has not the right to turn aside and heed not what is happening in the world around him, and this I maintain on moral grounds of the highest order.","Therefore, in my incontrovertible capacity as plaintiff and defendant judge and accused, I condemn this nature, which has so brazenly and unceremoniously inflicted this suffering... since I am unable to destroy Nature, I am destroying myself, solely out of weariness of having to endure a tyranny in which there is no guilty party.","What tender and devoted mother wouldn\'t be dismayed and ill with terror at her son\'s or daughter\'s stepping even one hair\'s breath off the beaten track. No, better let him be happy and live in comfort without originality, is what every mother thinks when she rocks the cradle. The only person among us who can fail to reach the general\'s rank is the original man - in other words, the man who won\'t be quiet.","I myself will perhaps cry out with all the rest, looking at the mother embracing her child\'s tormentor: \'Just art thou, O Lord!\' but I do not want to cry out with them. While there\'s still time, I hasten to defend myself against it, and therefore I absolutely renounce all higher harmony. It is not worth one little tear of even that one tormented child who beat her chest with her little fist and prayed to \'dear God\' in a stinking outhouse with her unredeemed tears!","Beauty will save the world","How does it come about that what an intelligent man expresses is much stupider than what remains inside him?","Love the animals. God has given them the rudiments of thought and joy untroubled. Don\'t trouble it, don\'t harass them, don\'t deprive them of their happiness, don\'t work against God\'s intent.","To love someone means to see him as God intended him.","Generally speaking, our prisoners were capable of loving animals, and if they had been allowed they would have delighted to rear large numbers of domestic animals and birds in the prison. And I wonder what other activity could better have softened and refined their harsh and brutal natures than this. But it was not allowed. Neither the regulations nor the nature of the prison made it possible.","My feelings, gratitude, for instance, are denied me simply because of my social position.","Alyosha\'s heart could not bear uncertainty, for the nature of his love was always active. He could not love passively; once he loved, he immediately also began to help.","Two times two will be four even without my will. Is that what you call man\'s free will?","The absurd is only too necessary on earth. The world stands on absurdities.","I am a sick man...I am a spiteful man. I am an unattractive man. I think my liver is diseased. Then again, I don\'t know a thing about my illness; I\'m not even sure what hurts.","Eh, brother, but nature has to be corrected and guided, otherwise we\'d all drown in prejudices. Without that there wouldn\'t be even a single great man.","Ah, Misha, he has a stormy spirit. His mind is in bondage. He is haunted by a great, unsolved doubt. He is one of those who don\'t want millions, but an answer to their questions.","But man is so addicted to systems and to abstract conclusions that he is prepared deliberately to distort the truth, to close his eyes and ears, but justify his logic at all cost.","...chance may do anything.","It wasn\'t the New World that mattered... Columbus died almost without seeing it; and not really knowing what he had discovered. It\'s life that matters, nothing but life - the process of discovering, the everlasting and perpetual process, not the discovery itself, at all.","How many ideas have there been in the history of man which were unthinkable ten years before they appeared?","If they drive God from the earth, we shall shelter Him underground.","He did not know that the new life would not be given him for nothing, that he would have to pay dearly for it, that it would cost him great striving, great suffering. But that is the beginning of a new story -- the story of the gradual renewal of a man, the story of his gradual regeneration, of his passing from one world into another, of his initiation into a new unknown life. That might be the subject of a new story, but our present story is ended.","He seemed, indeed, to accept everything without the least condemnation though often grieving bitterly.","I know that you don\'t believe it, but indeed, life will bring you through. You will live it down in time. What you need now is fresh air, fresh air, fresh air!","The degree of a nation\u2019s civilization can be seen in the way it treats its prisoners","As soon as any one is near me, his personality disturbs my self-complacency and restricts my freedom. In twenty-four hours I begin to hate the best of men: one because he\'s too long over his dinner; another because he has a cold and keeps on blowing his nose. I become hostile to people the moment they come close to me. But it has always happened that the more I detest men individually the more ardent becomes my love for humanity.","It is always so, when we are unhappy we feel more strongly the unhappiness of others; our feeling is not shattered, but becomes concentrated.","Man is unhappy because he doesn\'t know he\'s happy. If anyone finds out he\'ll become happy at once.","What does reason know? Reason only knows what it has succeeded in learning.","Put away your gods and come and worship ours, or we will kill you and your gods!","Now I\'m living out my life in a corner, trying to console myself with the stupid, useless excuse that an intelligent man cannot turn himself into anything, that only a fool can make anything he wants out of himself.","It is not the real punishment. The only effectual one, the only deterrent and softening one, lies in the recognition of sin by conscience.","It was a marvelous night, the sort of night one only experiences when one is young. The sky was so bright, and there were so many stars that, gazing upward, one couldn\'t help wondering how so many whimsical, wicked people could live under such a sky.","And the more I drink the more I feel it. That\'s why I drink too. I try to find sympathy and feeling in drink.... I drink so that I may suffer twice as much!","Gambling is a most foolish and imprudent pursuit.","I wanted to discuss the suffering of humanity in general, but perhaps we\'d better confine ourselves to the sufferings of children.","With old liars who have been acting all their lives there are moments when they enter so completely into their part that they tremble or shed tears in earnest, although at that very moment, or a second later, they are able to whisper to themselves, \\"You know you are lying, you shameless old sinner! You\'re acting now, in spite of your \'holy\' wrath.","I want peace; yes, I\'d sell the whole world for a farthing, straight off, so long as I was left in peace. Is the world to go to pot, or am I to go without my tea? I say that the world may go to pot for me so long as I always get my tea. Did you know that, or not? Well, anyway, I know that I am a blackguard, a scoundrel, an egoist, a sluggard.","That\'s always the way with fanatics; they cross themselves at the tavern and throw stones at the temple.","What if, when this fog scatters and flies upward, the whole rotten, slimey city goes with it, rises with the fog and vanishes like smoke.","Where is it I\'ve read that someone condemned to death says or thinks, an hour before his death, that if he had to live on some high rock, on such a narrow ledge that he\'d only room to stand, and the ocean, everlasting darkness, everlasting solitude, everlasting tempest around him, if he had to remain standing on a square yard of space all his life, a thousand years, eternity, it were better to live so than to die at once. Only to live, to live and live! Life, whatever it may be!","Man is stupid, phenomenally stupid.","We are born dead, and we are becoming more and more contented with our condition. We are acquiring the taste for it.","Man is a mystery. It needs to be unravelled, and if you spend your whole life unravelling it, don\'t say that you\'ve wasted time. I am studying that mystery because I want to be a human being.","Man, so long as he remains free, has no more constant and agonizing anxiety than find as quickly as possible someone to worship.","I have been tortured with longing to believe ... and the yearning grows stronger the more cogent the intellectual difficulties stand in the way.","It\'s a burden to us even to be human beings-men with our own real body and blood; we are ashamed of it, we think it a disgrace and try to contrive to be some sort of impossible generalized man.","Every ant  knows the  formula of its ant-hill, every  bee knows  the formula  of its  beehive. They know it  in their own way, not in our way. Only humankind does not know its own formula.","In a morbid condition of the brain, dreams often have a singular actuality, vividness, and extraordinary semblance of reality.",".. But do you understand, I cry to him, do you understand that along with happiness, in the exact same way, in perfectly equal proportion, man also needs unhappiness","Pray to God for gladness. Be glad as children, as the birds of heaven. And let not the sin of men confound you in your doings. Fear not that it will wear away your work and hinder its being accomplished. Do not say, \'Sin is mighty, wickedness is mighty, evil environment is mighty, and we are lonely and helpless, and evil environment is wearing us away and hindering our good work from being done.\' Fly from that dejection, children!","I want to suffer so that I may love.","What matters,\\" said the prince at last, \\"is that you have a child\'s trusting nature and extraordinary truthfulness. Do you know that a great deal can be forgiven you for that alone?","What do you think, would not one tiny crime be wiped out by thousands of good deeds?","Granted I am a babbler, a harmless vexatious babbler, like all of us. But what is to be done if the direct and sole vocation of every intelligent man is babble, that is, the intentional pouring of water through a sieve?","In the end they will lay their freedom at our feet and say to us, Make us your slaves, but feed us.","I have seen the truth. It is not as though I had invented it in my mind. I have seen it, SEEN IT and the living image of it has filled my soul forever.","Actions are sometimes performed in a masterly and most cunning way, while the direction of the actions is deranged and dependent on various morbid impressions - it\'s like a dream.","In a way there\'s only a fine shade of difference between the healthy and the deranged.","I agree that two and two make four is an excellent thing; but to give everything its due, two and two make five is also a very fine thing.","Filled with rapture, his soul yearned for freedom, space, vastness. Over him the heavenly dome, full of quiet, shining stars, hung boundlessly. From the zenith to the horizon the still-dim Milky Way stretched its double strand. Night, fresh and quiet, almost unstirring, enveloped the earth. The white towers and golden domes of the church gleamed in the sapphire sky. The luxuriant autumn asleep till morning. The silence of the earth seemed to merge with the silence of the heavens and the mystery of the earth touched the mystery of the stars.","I did not understand that she was hiding her feelings under irony, that this is usually the last refuge of modest and chaste-souled people when the privacy of their soul is coarsely and intrusively invaded, and that their pride makes them refuse to surrender till the last moment and shrink from giving expression to their feelings before you. to have guessed the truth from the timidity with which she had repeatedly approached her sarcasm, only bringing herself to utter it at last with an effort.","\u200eHonoured sir, poverty is not a vice, that\'s a true saying. Yet I know too that drunkeness is not a virtue, and that\'s even truer. But beggary, honoured sir, beggary is a vice. In poverty you may still retain your innate nobility of soul, but in beggary--never--no one. For beggary a man is not chased out of human society with a stick, he is swept out with a broom, so as to make it as humiliating as possible; and quite right, too, forasmuch as in beggary as I am ready to be the first to humiliate myself.","I say let the world go to hell, but I should always have my tea.","One\'s own free and unfettered volition, one\'s own caprice, however wild, one\'s own fancy, inflamed sometimes to the point of madness - that is the one best and greatest good, which is never taken into consideration because it cannot fit into any classification and the omission of which sends all systems and theories to the devil.","God is the pain of the fear of death","But what can a decent man speak of with most pleasure? Answer: Of himself. Well, so I will talk about myself.","What makes a hero? Courage, strength, morality, withstanding adversity? Are these the traits that truly show and create a hero? Is the light truly the source of darkness or vice versa? Is the soul a source of hope or despair? Who are these so called heroes and where do they come from? Are their origins in obscurity or in plain sight?","One circumstance tormented me then: Namely, that no one else was like me, and I was like no one else. I am only one, and they are all.","... you can never be sure of what has passed between husband and wife or lover and mistress.","What is the use of Christ\'s words, unless we set an example?","Love to throw yourself on the earth and kiss it. Kiss the earth and love it with an unceasing, consuming love.","Nothing could be more absurd than moral lessons at such a moment! Oh, self-satisfied people: with what proud self-satisfaction such babblers are ready to utter their pronouncements! If they only knew to what degree I myself understand all the loathsomeness of my present condition, they wouldn\'t have the heart to teach me.","Listen, in dreams and especially in nightmares, from indigestion or anything, a man sees sometimes such artistic visions, such complex and real actuality, such events, even a whole world of events, woven into such a plot, with such unexpected details from the most exalted matters to the last button on a cuff, as I swear Leo Tolstoy has never invented.","And you\'re sorry that the ephemeral beauty has faded so rapidly, so irretrievably, that it flashed so deceptively and pointlessly before your eyes - you\'re sorry, for you didn\'t even have time to fall in love.","Often a man endures for several years, submits and suffers the cruellest punishments, and then suddenly breaks out over some minute trifle, almost nothing at all.","The Golden Age is the most implausible of all dreams. But for it men have given up their life and strength; for the sake of it prophets have died and been slain; without it the people will not live and cannot die.","Even as I approach the gambling hall, as soon as I hear, two rooms away, the jingle of money poured out on the table, I almost go into convulsions.","I bless the rising sun each day, and, as before, my heart sings to meet it, but now I love even more its setting, its long slanting rays & the soft tender gentle memories that come with them...\u2019 -Father Zossima","After all, I quite naturally want to live in order to fulfill my whole capacity for living, and not in order to fulfill my reasoning capacity alone, which is no more than some one-twentieth of my capacity for living. What does reason know? It knows only what it has managed to learn (and it may never learn anything else; that isn\'t very reassuring, but why not admit it?), while human nature acts as a complete entity, with all that is in it, consciously or unconsciously; and though it may be wrong, it\'s nevertheless alive.","Without God all things are permitted.","\\"I love mankind,\\" he said, \\"but I find to my amazement that the more I love mankind as a whole, the less I love man in particular.\\"","If someone proved to me that Christ is outside the truth, and that in reality the truth were outside of Christ, then I should prefer to remain with Christ rather than with the truth.","The chief thing is to love others like yourself, that\'s the chief thing, and that\'s everything; nothing else is wanted - you will find out at once how to arrange it all.","Everywhere I am the object of an unbelievable esteem, the interest in me is, quite simply, tremendous.","One can\'t understand everything at once, we can\'t begin with perfection all at once! In order to reach perfection one must begin by being ignorant of a great deal. And if we understand things too quickly, perhaps we shan\'t understand them thoroughly.","[to Jesus] You did not come down from the cross when they shouted to you, mocking and reviling you: \\"Come down from the cross and we will believe that it is you.\\" You did not come down because, again, you did not want to enslave man by a miracle and thirsted for faith that is free, not miraculous...I swear, man is created weaker and baser than you thought him! How, how can he ever accomplish the same things as you? ...Respecting him less, you would have demanded less of him, and that would be closer to love, for his burden would be lighter.","You pass by a little child, you pass by, spiteful, with ugly words, with wrathful heart; you may not have noticed the child, but he has seen you, and your image, unseemly and ignoble, may remain in his defenseless heart. You don\'t know it, but you may have sown an evil seed in him and it may grow, and all because you were not careful before the child, because you did not foster in yourself a careful, actively benevolent love.","I walked along Nevsky Avenue.Actually it was more torture, humiliation, and bilious irritation than a stroll.","I tell you solemnly, that I have many times tried to become an insect. But I was not equal even to that. I swear, gentlemen, that to be too conscious is an illness \u2014 a real thorough-going illness.","And so in that very shame I suddenly begin a hymn.","But yet I am firmly persuaded that a great deal of consciousness, every sort of consciousness, in fact, is a disease.","Occasionally I was so much better that I could go out; but the streets used to put me in such a rage that I would lock myself up for days rather than go out, even if I were well enough to do so! I could not bear to see all those preoccupied, anxious-looking creatures continuously surging along the streets past me! Why are they always anxious? What is the meaning of their eternal care and worry? It is their wickedness, their perpetual detestable malice-that\'s what it is-they are all full of malice, malice!","Accept suffering and achieve atonement through it \u2014 that is what you must do.","Gentlemen, I am tormented by questions; answer them for me.","Imagine that you are creating a fabric of human destiny with the object of making men happy in the end, giving them peace and rest at last. Imagine that you are doing this but that it is essential and inevitable to torture to death only one tiny creature...in order to found that edifice on its unavenged tears. Would you consent to be the architect on those conditions? Tell me. Tell the truth.","For men are made for happiness, and any one who is completely happy has a right to say to himself, \'I am doing God\'s will on earth.\'","To be too conscious is an illness. A real thorough going illness.","...a condemned man who, at the hour of death, says or thinks that if the alternative were offered him of existing somewhere, on a height of rock or some narrow elevation, where only his two feet could stand, and round about him the ocean, perpetual gloom, perpetual solitude, perpetual storm, to remain there standing on a yard of surface for a lifetime, a thousand years, eternity! - rather would he live thus than die at once? Only live, live, live! - no matter how, only live!","And yet I am convinced that man will never give up true suffering- that is, destruction and chaos. Why, suffering is the sole root of consciousness.","Even there, in the mines, underground, I may find a human heart in another convict and murderer by my side, and I may make friends with him, for even there one may live and love and suffer. One may thaw and revive a frozen heart in that convict, one may wait upon him for years, and at last bring up from the dark depths a lofty soul, a feeling, suffering creature; one may bring forth an angel, create a hero! There are so many of them, hundreds of them, and we are all to blame for them. [...] If they drive God from the earth, we shall shelter Him underground.","I will not and cannot believe that evil is the normal condition of mankind.","I think everyone must love life more than anything else in the world.\' \'Love life more than the meaning of it?\' \'Yes, certainly. Love it regardless of logic, as you say. Yes, most certainly regardless of logic, for only then will I grasp its meaning. That\'s what I\'ve been vaguely aware of for a long time. Half your work is done, Ivan: you love life. Now you must try to do the second half and you are saved.","I have in my own life merely carried to the extreme that which you have never ventured to carry even halfway ; and what\'s more, you\'ve regarded your cowardice as prudence, and found comfort in deceiving yourselves. So that, in fact, I may be even more \\"alive\\" than you are. Do take a closer look!","If he\'s alive, everything is in his power! Whose fault is it that he doesn\'t understand that?","As for me, this is my story: I worked and was tortured. You know what it means to compose? No, thank God, you do not! I believe you have never written to order, by the yard, and have never experienced that hellish torture.","We are citizens of eternity.","I don\u2019t even know what I\u2019m writing, I have no idea, I don\u2019t know anything, and I\u2019m not reading over it, and I\u2019m not correcting my style, and I\u2019m writing just for the sake of writing, just for the sake of writing more to you\u2026 My precious, my darling, my dearest!","It is man\'s unique privilege, among all other organisms.

Otherwise we are not fathers, but enemies of our children, and they are not our children, but our enemies, and we have made them our enemies ourselves.","If there is no God, everything is permitted.","Father monks, why do you fast! Why do you expect reward in heaven for that?...No, saintly monk, you try being virtuous in the world, do good to society, without shutting yourself up in a monastery at other people\'s expense, and without expecting a reward up aloft for it--you\'ll find that a bit harder.","And do you know, do you know that mankind can live without the Englishman, it can live without Germany, it can live only too well without the Russian man, it can live without science, without bread, and it only cannot live without beauty, for then there would be nothing at all to do in the world! The whole secret is here, the whole of history is here. Science itself would not stand for a minute without beauty","Woe to the suicides! I believe that there can be none more miserable than they. Oh, there are some who remain proud and fierce even in hell, in spite of their certain knowledge and contemplation of the absolute truth; there are some fearful ones who have given themselves over to Satan and his proud spirit entirely. For such, hell is voluntary and ever consuming; they are tortured by their own choice. For they have cursed themselves, cursing God and life. And they will burn in the fire of their own wrath forever and yearn for death and annihilation. But they will not attain to death.","Or renounce life altogether! Accept fate obediently as it is, once and for all, and stifle everything in myself, renouncing any right to act, to live, to love.","I wanted to pray for an hour, but I keep thinking and thinking, and always sick thoughts, and my head aches - what is the use of praying? - it\'s only a sin! It is strange, too, that I am not sleepy: in great, too great sorrow, after the first outbursts one is always sleepy. Men condemned to death, they say, sleep very soundly on the last night. And so it must be, it si the law of nature, otherwise their strength would not hold out...

But then, it is in despair that we find the most acute pleasure, especially when we are aware of the hopelessness of the situation... ...everything is a mess in which it is impossible to tell what\'s what, but that despite this impossibility and deception it still hurts you, and the less you can understand, the more it hurts.","It suddenly seemed to me that I was lonely, that everyone was forsaking me and going away from me.","What if man is not really a scoundrel, man in general, I mean, the whole race of mankind-then all the rest is prejudice, simply artificial terrors and there are no barriers and it\'s all as it should be.","..., twice two is four is not life, gentlemen, but the beginning of death.","At that point I ought to have gone away, but a strange sensation rose up in me, a sort of defiance of fate, a desire to challenge it, to put out my tongue at it. I laid down the largest stake allowe-four thousand gulden-and lost it. Then, getting hot, I pulled out all I had left, staked it on the same number, and lost again, after which I walked away from the table as though I were stunned. I could not even grasp what had happened to me.","This pleasure comes precisely from the sharpest awareness of your own degradation; from the knowledge that you have gone to the utmost limit; that it is despicable, yet cannot be otherwise; that you no longer have any way out; that you will never become a different man.","I could not become anything; neither good nor bad; neither a scoundrel nor an honest man; neither a hero nor an insect. And now I am eking out my days in my corner, taunting myself with the bitter and entirely useless consolation that an intelligent man cannot seriously become anything, that only a fool can become something.","And in vain does the dreamer rummage about in his old dreams, raking them over as though they were a heap of cinders, looking into these cinders for some spark, however tiny, to fan it into a flame so as to warm his chilled blood by it and revive in it all that he held so dear before, all that touched his heart, that made his blood course through his veins, that drew tears from his eyes, and that so splendidly deceived him!","In a morbid condition of the brain, dreams often have a singular actuality, vividness, and extraordinary semblance of reality.  At times monstrous images are created, but the setting and the whole picture are so truth-like and filled with details so delicate, so unexpectedly, but so artistically consistent, that the dreamer, were he an artist like Pushkin or Turgenev even, could never have invented them in the waking state.  Such sick dreams always remain long in the memory and make a powerful impression on the overwrought and deranged nervous system.","In abstract love of humanity one almost always only loves oneself.","...one may say anything about the history of the world - anything that might enter the most disordered imagination. The only thing one can\'t say is that it\'s rational.","I\'ve made a terrible confession to you, he concluded gloomily. Do appreciate it, gentlemen.

They call me a madman now. That would be a distinct rise in my social position were it not that they still regard me as being as ridiculous as ever.","Even if we are occupied with important things and even if we attain honour or fall into misfortune, still let us remember how good it once was here, when we were all together united by a good and kind feeling which made us perhaps better than we are.","On our earth we can only love withsuffering and through suffering.","One must be a great man indeed to be able to hold out even against common sense.\\" \\"Or else a fool.","Pass us by, and forgive us our happiness","Do you believe in a future everlasting life?

Is not reason in error as regards advantage? Does not man, perhaps, love something besides well-being? Perhaps he is just as fond of suffering? Perhaps suffering is just as great a benefit to him as well-being? Man is sometimes extraordinarily, passionately, in love with suffering, and that is a fact.","A widow, the mother of a family, and from her heart she produces chords to which my whole being responds.","For if there\'s no everlasting God, there\'s no such thing as virtue, and there\'s no need of it.","Because everyone is guilty for everyone else.

Twice-two-makes-four is, in my humble opinion, nothing but a piece of impudence. Twice-two-makes-four is a farcical, dressed-up fellow who stands across your path with arms akimbo and spits at you.","It is easier for a Russian to become an Atheist, than for any other nationality in the world. And not only does a Russian \'become an Atheist,\' but he actually BELIEVES IN Atheism, just as though he had found a new faith, not perceiving that he has pinned his faith to a negation.

As far as I myself am concerned, I have merely carried to an extreme in my life what you have not dared to carry even halfway, and, what\'s more, you\'ve taken your cowardice for good sense, and found comfort in thus deceiving yourselves. So that I, perhaps, come out even more \\"living\\" than you.","But try getting blindly carried away by your feelings, without reasoning, without a primary cause, driving consciousness away at least for a time; start hating, or fall in love, only so as not to sit with folded arms.","They have this social justification for every nasty thing they do!","I used to imagine adventures for myself, I invented a life, so that I could at least exist somehow.","I love the sticky leaves in spring, the blue sky \u2014 that\u2019s all it is.

That is his normal condition. Of that I am firmly persuaded. He is made and constructed to that very end. And not only at the present time owing to some casual circumstance, but always, at all times, a decent man is bound to be a coward and a slave.","I tell Thee that man is tormented by no greater anxiety than to find someone quickly to whom he can hand over that gift of freedom with which the ill-fated creatures is born. But only one who can appease their conscience can take over their freedom [\u2026] Instead of taking men\'s freedom from them, Thou didst make it greater than ever! Didst Thou forget that man prefers peace, and even death, to freedom of choice in the knowledge of good and evil?","You can\'t be angry with me, because I am a hundred times more severely punished than you, if only by the fact that I shall never see you again.","Coming at twenty to his father\'s house, which was a very sink of filthy debauchery, he, chaste and pure as he was, simply withdrew in silence when to look on was unbearable, but without the slightest sign of contempt or condemnation. His father, who had once been in a dependent position, and so was sensitive and ready to take offense, met him at first with distrust and sullenness.","Who doesn\'t desire his fathers death?","It is easier for a Russian to become an atheist than for anyone else in the world.","Here my tears are falling, Nastenka.

Suddenly I noticed in one of these patches a star , and began watching it intently. That was because that star had given me an idea : I decided to kill myself that night .","Man is a creative animal, doomed to strive toward a goal, engaged in full-time engineering.","Twice two makes four seems to me simply a piece of insolence. Twice two makes four is a pert coxcomb who stands with arms akimbo barring your path and spitting. I admit that twice two makes four is an excellent thing, but if we are to give everything its due, twice two makes five is sometimes a very charming thing too.","I suddenly dreamt that I picked up the revolver and aimed it straight at my heart my heart, and not my head; and I had determined beforehand to fire at my head, at my right temple. After aiming at my chest I waited a second or two, and suddenly my candle , my table, and the wall in front of me began moving and heaving. I made haste to pull the trigger.","If the person laughs well, they are a good person.","Don\'t think I\'m talking nonsense because I\'m drunk. I\'m not a bit drunk. Brandy\'s all very well, but I need two bottles to make me drunk.","People talk sometimes of a bestial cruelty, but that\'s a great injustice and insult to the beasts; a beast can never be so cruel as a man, so artistically cruel. The tiger only tears and gnaws, that\'s all he can do. He would never think of nailing people by the ears, even if he were able to do it.","I used to analyze myself down to the last thread, used to compare myself with others, recalled all the smallest glances, smiles and words of those to whom I\u2019d tried to be frank, interpreted everything in a bad light, laughed viciously at my attempts \u2018to be like the rest\u2019 \u2013and suddenly, in the midst of my laughing, I\u2019d give way to sadness, fall into ludicrous despondency and once again start the whole process all over again \u2013 in short, I went round and round like a squirrel on a wheel.","Every man has some reminiscences which he would not tell to everyone, but only to his friends.","The fear of appearances is the first symptom of impotence.","Oh, gentlemen, perhaps I really regard myself as an intelligent man only because throughout my entire life I\'ve never been able to start or finish anything. Granted, granted I\'m a babbler, a harmless, irksome babbler, as we all are. But what\'s to be done if the sole and express purpose of every intelligent man is babble--that is, a deliberate pouring from empty into void.","Trifles, trifles are what matter!","You\u2019re a gentleman,\u201d they used to say to him. \u201cYou shouldn\u2019t have gone murdering people with a hatchet; that\u2019s no occupation for a gentleman.","Sometimes a man is intensely, even passionately, attached to suffering \u2014 that is a fact.","It is necessary that every man have at least somewhere to go. For there are times when one absolutely must go at least somewhere!","My friends, ask gladness from God. Be glad as children, as birds in the sky. And let man\'s sin not disturb you in your efforts, do not feat that it will dampen your endeavor and keep it from being fulfilled, do not say, Sin is strong, impiety is strong, the bad environment is strong, and we are lonely and powerless, the bad environment will dampen us and keep our good endeavor from being fulfilled. Flee from such despondency, my children! There is only one salvation for you: take yourself up, and make yourself responsible for the sins of men.","... you simply can\'t imagine what men will say!","you don\'t need free will to determine that twice two is four. that\'s not what i call free will","By the experience of active love. Strive to love your neighbour actively and indefatigably. In as far as you advance in love you will grow surer of the reality of God and of the immortality of your soul. If you attain to perfect self-forgetfulness in the love of your neighbour, then you will believe without doubt, and no doubt can possibly enter your soul. This has been tried. This is certain.","Of course boredom may lead you to anything. It is boredom sets one sticking golden pins into people, but all that would not matter. What is bad (this is my comment again) is that I dare say people will be thankful for the gold pins then.","No, I can\'t admit it. Brother,\' said Alyosha suddenly, with flashing eyes, \'you said just now, is there a being in the whole world who would have the right to forgive and could firgive? But there is a Being and He can forgive everything, all and for all, because He gave His innocent blood for all and everything. You have forgotten Him, and on Him is built the edifice, and it is to Him they cry aloud, \\"Thou art just, O Lord, for Thy ways are revealed!","A special form of misery had begun to oppress him of late. There was nothing poignant, nothing acute about it; but there was a feeling of permanence, of eternity about it; it brought a foretaste of hopeless years of this cold leaden misery, a foretaste of an eternity \\"on a square yard of space.","Make us your slaves, but feed us.","But it\'s precisely in this cold, loathsome half-despair, half-belief, in this deliberate burying of yourself underground for forty years out of sheer pain, in this assiduously constructed, and yet somewhat dubious hopelessness, in all this poision of unfulfilled desires turned inward, this fever of vacillations, of resolutions adopted for eternity, and of repentances a moment later that you find the very essence of that strange, sharp pleasure.","If thou love each thing thou wilt perceive the mystery of God in all.","Of course I shall go astray often...for who does not make mistakes? But I cannot go far wrong for I have seen the truth.","Oh, if only I did nothing simply as a result of laziness.","I never have frustrations. The reason is to wit: Of at first I don\'t succeed, I quit!","Your hand is cold, mine burns like fire. How blind you are, Nastenka!","I punish myself for my whole life, my whole life I punish.","Hold your tongue; you won\'t understand anything. If there is no God, then I am God.","But do you understand, I cry to him, do you understand that if you have the guillotine in the forefront, and with such glee, it\'s for the sole reason that cutting heads off is the easiest thing, and having an idea is difficult!","Is there in the whole world a being who would have the right to forgive and could forgive?","Do you understand, sir, do you understand what it means when you have absolutely nowhere to turn?\\" Marmeladov\'s question came suddenly into his mind \\"for every man must have somewhere to turn.","At first it was simply liking, Nastenka, but now, now ! I am just in the same position as you were when you went to him with your bundle. In a worse position than you, Nastenka,because he cared for no one else as you do.","Know, then, that now, precisely now, these people are more certain than ever before that they are completely free, and at the same time they themselves have brought us their freedom and obediently laid it at our feet. It is our doing, but is it what you wanted? This sort of freedom?\' Again I don\'t understand\', Alyosha interrupted, \'Is he being ironic? Is he laughing?\' Not in the least. He precisely lays it to his and his colleagues\' credit that they have finally overcome freedom, and have done so in order to make people happy.","And now I am eking out my days in my corner, taunting myself with the bitter and entirely useless consolations that an intelligent man cannot seriously become anything; that only a fool can become something. Yes, sir, an intelligent nineteenth-century man must be, is morally bound to be, an essentially characterless creature; and a man of character, a man of action - an essentially limited creature. This is my conviction at the age of forty. I am forty now, and forty years - why, it is all of a lifetime, it is the deepest of old age. Living past forty is indecent, vulgar, immoral!","Ah, Father! That\u2019s words and only words! Forgive! If he\u2019d not been run over, he\u2019d have come home today drunk and his only shirt dirty and in rags and he\u2019d have fallen asleep like a log, and I should have been sousing and rinsing till daybreak, washing his rags and the children\u2019s and then drying them by the window and as soon as it was daylight I should have been darning them. What\u2019s the use of talking forgiveness! I have forgiven as it is!","Whatever distinguishes one lump of flesh from another when we\'re alive, we\'re all the same once we\'re dead. Just used-up shells.","It\u2019s not God that I don\u2019t accept, Alyosha, only I most respectfully return him the ticket.","For example, I\'m terribly proud. I\'m as mistrustful and as sensitive as a hunchback or a dwarf; but, in truth, I\'ve experienced some moments when if someone had slapped my face, I might even have been grateful for it. I\'m being serious. I probably would have been able to derive a peculiar sort of pleasure from it-the pleasure of despair, naturally, but the most intense pleasures occur in despair, especially when you\'re very acutely aware of the hopelessness of your own predicament.","I am a sick man...I am a wicked man. An unattractive man.  I think my liver hurts.  However, i don\'t know a fig about my sickness, and am not sure what it is that hurts me.  I am not being treated and never have been, though I respect medicine.  What\'s more, I am also superstitious in the extreme; well, at least enough to respect medicine.","The darker the night, the brighter the stars,  The deeper the grief, the closer is God!","Man only likes to count his troubles; he doesn\'t calculate his happiness.","I love mankind, he said, \\"but I find to my amazement that the more I love mankind as a whole, the less I love man in particular.","Taking a new step, uttering a new word, is what people fear most.","The world says: \\"You have needs -- satisfy them. You have as much right as the rich and the mighty. Don\'t hesitate to satisfy your needs; indeed, expand your needs and demand more.\\" This is the worldly doctrine of today. And they believe that this is freedom. The result for the rich is isolation and suicide, for the poor, envy and murder.","I am a dreamer. I know so little of real life that I just can\'t help re-living such moments as these in my dreams, for such moments are something I have very rarely experienced. I am going to dream about you the whole night, the whole week, the whole year. I feel I know you so well that I couldn\'t have known you better if we\'d been friends for twenty years. You won\'t fail me, will you? Only two minutes, and you\'ve made me happy forever. Yes, happy. Who knows, perhaps you\'ve reconciled me with myself, resolved all my doubts.When I woke up it seemed to me that some snatch of a tune I had known for a long time, I had heard somewhere before but had forgotten, a melody of great sweetness, was coming back to me now. It seemed to me that it had been trying to emerge from my soul all my life, and only now-If and when you fall in love, may you be happy with her. I don\'t need to wish her anything, for she\'ll be happy with you. May your sky always be clear, may your dear smile always be bright and happy, and may you be for ever blessed for that moment of bliss and happiness which you gave to another lonely and grateful heart. Isn\'t such a moment sufficient for the whole of one\'s life?","To love someone means to see them as God intended them.","The awful thing is that beauty is mysterious as well as terrible. God and the devil are fighting there and the battlefield is the heart of man.","Man is sometimes extraordinarily, passionately, in love with suffering...","Pain and suffering are always inevitable for a large intelligence and a deep heart.","Sarcasm: the last refuge of modest and chaste-souled people when the PRIVACY of their soul is coarsely and intrusively invaded.","Love in action is a harsh and dreadful thing compared to love in dreams.","For, after all, you do grow up, you do outgrow your ideals, which turn to dust and ashes, which are shattered into fragments; and if you have no other life, you just have to build one up out of these fragments. And all the time your soul is craving and longing for something else. And in vain does the dreamer rummage about in his old dreams, raking them over as though they were a heap of cinders, looking in these cinders for some spark, however tiny, to fan it into a flame so as to warm his chilled blood by it and revive in it all that he held so dear before, all that touched his heart, that made his blood course through his veins, that drew tears from his eyes, and that so splendidly deceived him!","I believe like a child that suffering will be healed and made up for, that all the humiliating absurdity of human contradictions will vanish like a pitiful mirage, like the despicable fabrication of the impotent and infinitely small Euclidean mind of man, that in the world\'s finale, at the moment of eternal harmony, something so precious will come to pass that it will suffice for all hearts, for the comforting of all resentments, for the atonement of all the crimes of humanity, for all the blood that they\'ve shed; that it will make it not only possible to forgive but to justify all that has happened.","The centripetal force on our planet is still fearfully strong, Alyosha. I have a longing for life, and I go on living in spite of logic. Though I may not believe in the order of the universe, yet I love the sticky little leaves as they open in spring. I love the blue sky, I love some people, whom one loves you know sometimes without knowing why. I love some great deeds done by men, though I\u2019ve long ceased perhaps to have faith in them, yet from old habit one\u2019s heart prizes them. Here they have brought the soup for you, eat it, it will do you good. It\u2019s first-rate soup, they know how to make it here. I want to travel in Europe, Alyosha, I shall set off from here. And yet I know that I am only going to a graveyard, but it\u2019s a most precious graveyard, that\u2019s what it is! Precious are the dead that lie there, every stone over them speaks of such burning life in the past, of such passionate faith in their work, their truth, their struggle and their science, that I know I shall fall on the ground and kiss those stones and weep over them; though I\u2019m convinced in my heart that it\u2019s long been nothing but a graveyard. And I shall not weep from despair, but simply because I shall be happy in my tears, I shall steep my soul in emotion. I love the sticky leaves in spring, the blue sky \u2014 that\u2019s all it is. It\u2019s not a matter of intellect or logic, it\u2019s loving with one\u2019s inside, with one\u2019s stomach.","Above all, do not lie to yourself. A man who lies to himself and listens to his own lie comes to a point where he does not discern any truth either in himself or anywhere around him, and thus falls into disrespect towards himself and others. Not respecting anyone, he ceases to love, and having no love, he gives himself up to passions and coarse pleasures in order to occupy and amuse himself, and in his vices reaches complete beastiality, and it all comes form lying continually to others and himself. A man who lies to himself is often the first to take offense. it sometimes feels very good to take offense, doesn\'t it? And surely he knows that no one has offended him, and that he himself has invented the offense and told lies just for the beauty of it, that he has exaggerated for the sake of effect, that he has picked up on a word and made a mountain out of a pea--he knows all of that, and still he is the first to take offense, he likes feeling offended, it gives him great pleasure, and thus he reaches the point of real hostility...","I am a sick man... I am a spiteful man. I am an unpleasant man. I think my liver is diseased. However, I don\'t know beans about my disease, and I am not sure what is bothering me. I don\'t treat it and never have, though I respect medicine and doctors. Besides, I am extremely superstitious, let\'s say sufficiently so to respect medicine. (I am educated enough not to be superstitious, but I am.) No, I refuse to treat it out of spite. You probably will not understand that. Well, but I understand it. Of course I can\'t explain to you just whom I am annoying in this case by my spite. I am perfectly well aware that I cannot \\"get even\\" with the doctors by not consulting them. I know better than anyone that I thereby injure only myself and no one else. But still, if I don\'t treat it, its is out of spite. My liver is bad, well then-- let it get even worse!","The more I love humanity in general the less I love man in particular. In my dreams, I often make plans for the service of humanity, and perhaps I might actually face crucifixion if it were suddenly necessary. Yet I am incapable of living in the same room with anyone for two days together. I know from experience. As soon as anyone is near me, his personality disturbs me and restricts my freedom. In twenty-four hours I begin to hate the best of men: one because he\u2019s too long over his dinner, another because he has a cold and keeps on blowing his nose. I become hostile to people the moment they come close to me. But it has always happened that the more I hate men individually the more I love humanity.","Do you understand, sir, do you understand what it means when you have absolutely nowhere to turn?\\" Marmeladov\u2019s question came suddenly into his mind \\"for every man must have somewhere to turn...","The pleasure of despair. But then, it is in despair that we find the most acute pleasure, especially when we are aware of the hopelessness of the situation......everything is a mess in which it is impossible to tell what\'s what, but that despite this impossibility and deception it still hurts you, and the less you can understand, the more it hurts.","We sometimes encounter people, even perfect strangers, who begin to interest us at first sight, somehow suddenly, all at once, before a word has been spoken","What do you think?\\" shouted Razumihin, louder than ever, \\"you think I am attacking them for talking nonsense? Not a bit! I like them to talk nonsense. That\'s man\'s one privilege over all creation. Through error you come to the truth! I am a man because I err! You never reach any truth without making fourteen mistakes and very likely a hundred and fourteen. And a fine thing, too, in its way; but we can\'t even make mistakes on our own account! Talk nonsense, but talk your own nonsense, and I\'ll kiss you for it. To go wrong in one\'s own way is better than to go right in someone else\'s. In the first case you are a man, in the second you\'re no better than a bird. Truth won\'t escape you, but life can be cramped. There have been examples. And what are we doing now? In science, development, thought, invention, ideals, aims, liberalism, judgment, experience and everything, everything, everything, we are still in the preparatory class at school. We prefer to live on other people\'s ideas, it\'s what we are used to! Am I right, am I right?\\" cried Razumihin, pressing and shaking the two ladies\' hands.","Remember particularly that you cannot be a judge of anyone. For no one can judge a criminal until he recognizes that he is just such a criminal as the man standing before him, and that he perhaps is more than all men to blame for that crime. When he understands that, he will be able to be a judge. Though that sounds absurd, it is true. If I had been righteous myself, perhaps there would have been no criminal standing before me. If you can take upon yourself the crime of the criminal your heart is judging, take it at once, suffer for him yourself, and let him go without reproach. And even if the law itself makes you his judge, act in the same spirit so far as possible, for he will go away and condemn himself more bitterly than you have done. If, after your kiss, he goes away untouched, mocking at you, do not let that be a stumbling-block to you. It shows his time has not yet come, but it will come in due course. And if it come not, no matter; if not he, then another in his place will understand and suffer, and judge and condemn himself, and the truth will be fulfilled. Believe that, believe it without doubt; for in that lies all the hope and faith of the saints.","Do you know I\'ve been sitting here thinking to myself: that if I didn\'t believe in life, if I lost faith in the woman I love, lost faith in the order of things, were convinced in fact that everything is a disorderly, damnable, and perhaps devil-ridden chaos, if I were struck by every horror of man\'s disillusionment -- still I should want to live. Having once tasted of the cup, I would not turn away from it till I had drained it! At thirty though, I shall be sure to leave the cup even if I\'ve not emptied it, and turn away -- where I don\'t know. But till I am thirty I know that my youth will triumph over everything -- every disillusionment, every disgust with life. I\'ve asked myself many times whether there is in the world any despair that could overcome this frantic thirst for life. And I\'ve come to the conclusion that there isn\'t, that is until I am thirty.","I don\u2019t know how to be silent when my heart is speaking.","It\'s life that matters, nothing but life\u2014the process of discovering, the everlasting and perpetual process, not the discovery itself, at all.","I love, I can only love the one I\'ve left behind, stained with my blood when, ungrateful wretch that I am, I extinguished myself and shot myself through the heart. But never, never have I ceased to love that one, and even on the night I parted from him I loved him perhaps more poignantly than ever. We can truly love only with suffering and through suffering! We know not how to love otherwise. We know no other love. I want suffering in order to love. I want and thirst this very minute to kiss , with tears streaming down my cheeks, this one and only I have left behind. I don\'t want and won\'t accept any other.","I swear, gentlemen, that to be too conscious is an illness - a real thorough-going illness.","Nothing has ever been more insupportable for a man and a human society than freedom.\u2013The Grand Inquisitor","In a morbid condition, dreams are often distinguished by their remarkably graphic, vivid, and extremely lifelike quality. The resulting picture is sometimes monstrous, but the setting and the whole process of the presentation sometimes happen to be so probable, and with details so subtle, unexpected, yet artistically consistent with the whole fullness of the picture, that even the dreamer himself would be unable to invent them in reality, though he were as much an artist as Pushkin or Turgenev.

People talk to you a great deal about your education, but some good, sacred memory, preserved from childhood, is perhaps the best education. If a man carries many such memories with him into life, he is safe to the end of his days, and if one has only one good memory left in one\'s heart, even that may sometime be the means of saving us.","I think I could stand anything, any suffering, only to be able to say and to repeat to myself every moment, \'I exist.\' In thousands of agonies -- I exist. I\'m tormented on the rack -- but I exist! Though I sit alone in a pillar -- I exist! I see the sun, and if I don\'t see the sun, I know it\'s there. And there\'s a whole life in that, in knowing that the sun is there.","Your worst sin is that you have destroyed and betrayed yourself for nothing.","Because it begins to seem to me at such times that I am incapable of beginning a life in real life, because it has seemed to me that I have lost all touch, all instinct for the actual, the real; because at last I have cursed myself; because after my fantastic nights I have moments of returning sobriety, which are awful! Meanwhile, you hear the whirl and roar of the crowd in the vortex of life around you; you hear, you see, men living in reality; you see that life for them is not forbidden, that their life does not float away like a dream, like a vision; that their life is being eternally renewed, eternally youthful, and not one hour of it is the same as another; while fancy is so spiritless, monotonous to vulgarity and easily scared, the slave of shadows, of the idea, the slave of the first cloud that shrouds the sun... One feels that this inexhaustible fancy is weary at last and worn out with continual exercise, because one is growing into manhood, outgrowing one\'s old ideals: they are being shattered into fragments, into dust; if there is no other life one must build one up from the fragments. And meanwhile the soul longs and craves for something else! And in vain the dreamer rakes over his old dreams, as though seeking a spark among the embers, to fan them into flame, to warm his chilled heart by the rekindled fire, and to rouse up in it again all that was so sweet, that touched his heart, that set his blood boiling, drew tears from his eyes, and so luxuriously deceived him!","How can a man of consciousness have the slightest respect for himself","Sorrow compressed my heart, and I felt I would die, and then . . .

It\'s life that matters, nothing but life \u2014 the process of discovering, the everlasting and perpetual process, not the discovery itself, at all.","May your sky always be clear, may your dear smile always be bright and happy, and may you be for ever blessed for that moment of bliss and happiness which you gave to another lonely and grateful heart. Isn\'t such a moment sufficient for the whole of one\'s life?","I utter what you would not dare think.","Oh, how unbearable is a happy person sometimes!","Sometimes you dream strange dreams, impossible and unnatural; you wake up and remember them clearly, and are surprised at a strange fact: you remember first of all that reason did not abandon you during the whole course of your dream; you even remember that you acted extremely cleverly and logically for that whole long, long time when you were surrounded by murderers, when they were being clever with you, concealed their intentions, treated you in a friendly way, though they already had their weapons ready and were only waiting for some sort of sign; you remember how cleverly you finally deceived them, hid from them; then you realize that they know your whole deception by heart and merely do not show you that they know where you are hiding; but you are clever and deceive them again\u2014all that you remember clearly. But why at the same time could your reason be reconciled with such obvious absurdities and impossibilities, with which, among other things, your dream was filled? Before your eyes, one of your murderers turned into a woman, and from a woman into a clever, nasty little dwarf\u2014and all that you allowed at once, as an accomplished fact, almost without the least perplexity, and precisely at the moment when, on the other hand, your reason was strained to the utmost, displaying extraordinary force, cleverness, keenness, logic? Why, also, on awakening from your dream and entering fully into reality, do you feel almost every time, and occasionally with an extraordinary force of impressions, that along with the dream you are leaving behind something you have failed to fathom? You smile at the absurdity of your dream and feel at the same time that the tissue of those absurdities contains some thought, but a thought that is real, something that belongs to your true life, something that exists and has always existed in your heart; it is as if your dream has told you something new, prophetic, awaited; your impression is strong, it is joyful or tormenting, but what it is and what has been told you\u2014all that you can neither comprehend nor recall.","I like revisiting, at certain times, spots where I was once happy; I like to shape the present in the image of the irretrievable past.","There are seconds, they come only five or six at a time, and you suddenly feel the presence of eternal harmony, fully achieved. It is nothing earthly; not that it\'s heavenly, but man cannot endure it in his earthly state. One must change physically or die. The feeling is clear and indisputable. As if you suddenly sense the whole of nature and suddenly say: yes, this is true. God, when he was creating the world, said at the end of each day of creation: \'Yes, this is true, this is good.\' This . . . this is not tenderheartedness, but simply joy. You don\'t forgive anything, because there is no longer anything to forgive. You don\'t really love \u2014 oh, what is here is higher than love! What\'s most frightening is that it\'s so terribly clear, and there\'s such joy. If it were longer than five seconds \u2014 the soul couldn\'t endure it and would vanish. In those five seconds I live my life through, and for them I would give my whole life, because it\'s worth it. To endure ten seconds one would have to change physically . . . .","the most offensive is not their lying\u2014one can always forgive lying\u2014lying is a delightful thing, for it leads to truth\u2014what is offensive is that they lie and worship their own lying\u2026","In sinning, each man sins against all, and each man is at least partly guilty for another\'s sin.

If you do not attain happiness, always remember that you are on the right road, and try not to leave it. Above all, avoid falsehood, every kind of falsehood, especially falseness to yourself. Watch over your own deceitfulness and look into it every hour, every minute. Avoid being scornful, both to others and to yourself. What seems to you bad within you will grow purer from the very fact of your observing it in yourself. Avoid fear, too, though fear is only the consequence of every sort of falsehood. Never be frightened at your own faint-heartedness in attaining love.","In the end, you feel that your much-vaunted, inexhaustible fantasy is growing tired, debilitated, exhausted, because you\'re bound to grow out of your old ideals; they\'re smashed to splinters and turn to dust, and if you have no other life, you have no choice but to keep rebuilding your dreams from the splinters and dust. But the heart longs for something different! And it is vain to dig in the ashes of your old fancies, trying to find even a tiny spark to fan into a new flame that will warm the chilled heart and bring back to life everything that can send the blood rushing wildly through the body, fill the eyes with tears--everything that can delude you so well!","What is to be done with the millions of facts that bear witness that men, consciously, that is fully understanding their real interests, have left them in the background and have rushed headlong on another path, to meet peril and danger, compelled to this course by nobody and by nothing, but, as it were, simply disliking the beaten track, and have obstinately, wilfully, struck out another difficult, absurd way, seeking it almost in the darkness. So, I suppose, this obstinacy and perversity were pleasanter to them than any advantage...The fact is, gentlemen, it seems there must really exist something that is dearer to almost every man than his greatest advantages, or (not to be illogical) there is a most advantageous advantage (the very one omitted of which we spoke just now) which is more important and more advantageous than all other advantages, for the sake of which a man if necessary is ready to act in opposition to all laws; that is, in opposition to reason, honour, peace, prosperity -- in fact, in opposition to all those excellent and useful things if only he can attain that fundamental, most advantageous advantage which is dearer to him than all. \\"Yes, but it\'s advantage all the same,\\" you will retort. But excuse me, I\'ll make the point clear, and it is not a case of playing upon words. What matters is, that this advantage is remarkable from the very fact that it breaks down all our classifications, and continually shatters every system constructed by lovers of mankind for the benefit of mankind. In fact, it upsets everything...One\'s own free unfettered choice, one\'s own caprice, however wild it may be, one\'s own fancy worked up at times to frenzy -- is that very \\"most advantageous advantage\\" which we have overlooked, which comes under no classification and against which all systems and theories are continually being shattered to atoms. And how do these wiseacres know that man wants a normal, a virtuous choice? What has made them conceive that man must want a rationally advantageous choice? What man wants is simply independent choice, whatever that independence may cost and wherever it may lead. And choice, of course, the devil only knows what choice.Of course, this very stupid thing, this caprice of ours, may be in reality, gentlemen, more advantageous for us than anything else on earth, especially in certain cases\u2026 for in any circumstances it preserves for us what is most precious and most important -- that is, our personality, our individuality. Some, you see, maintain that this really is the most precious thing for mankind; choice can, of course, if it chooses, be in agreement with reason\u2026 It is profitable and sometimes even praiseworthy. But very often, and even most often, choice is utterly and stubbornly opposed to reason ... and ... and ... do you know that that, too, is profitable, sometimes even praiseworthy?I believe in it, I answer for it, for the whole work of man really seems to consist in nothing but proving to himself every minute that he is a man and not a piano-key! \u2026And this being so, can one help being tempted to rejoice that it has not yet come off, and that desire still depends on something we don\'t know?You will scream at me (that is, if you condescend to do so) that no one is touching my free will, that all they are concerned with is that my will should of itself, of its own free will, coincide with my own normal interests, with the laws of nature and arithmetic. Good heavens, gentlemen, what sort of free will is left when we come to tabulation and arithmetic, when it will all be a case of twice two make four? Twice two makes four without my will. As if free will meant that!","Some sleepers have intelligent faces even in sleep, while other faces, even intelligent ones, become very stupid in sleep and therefore ridiculous. I don\'t know what makes that happen; I only want to say that a laughing man, like a sleeping one, most often knows nothing about his face. A great many people don\'t know how to laugh at all. However, there\'s nothing to know here: it\'s a gift, and it can\'t be fabricated. It can only be fabricated by re-educating oneself, developing oneself for the better, and overcoming the bad instincts of one\'s character; then the laughter of such a person might quite possibly change for the better. A man can give himself away completely by his laughter, so that you suddenly learn all of his innermost secrets. Even indisputably intelligent laughter is sometimes repulsive. Laughter calls first of all for sincerity, and where does one find sincerity? Laughter calls for lack of spite, but people most often laugh spitefully. Sincere and unspiteful laughter is mirth. A man\'s mirth is a feature that gives away the whole man, from head to foot. Someone\'s character won\'t be cracked for a long time, then the man bursts out laughing somehow quite sincerely, and his whole character suddenly opens up as if on the flat of your hand. Only a man of the loftiest and happiest development knows how to be mirthful infectiously, that is, irresistibly and goodheartedly. I\'m not speaking of his mental development, but of his character, of the whole man. And so, if you want to discern a man and know his soul, you must look, not at how he keeps silent, or how he speaks, or how he weeps, or even how he is stirred by the noblest ideas, but you had better look at him when he laughs. If a man has a good laugh, it means he\'s a good man. Note at the same time all the nuances: for instance, a man\'s laughter must in no case seem stupid to you, however merry and simplehearted it may be. The moment you notice the slightest trace of stupidity in someone\'s laughter, it undoubtedly means that the man is of limited intelligence, though he may do nothing but pour out ideas. Or if his laughter isn\'t stupid, but the man himself, when he laughs, for some reason suddenly seems ridiculous to you, even just slightly\u2014know, then, that the man has no real sense of dignity, not fully in any case. Or finally, if his laughter is infectious, but for some reason still seems banal to you, know, then, that the man\'s nature is on the banal side as well, and all the noble and lofty that you noticed in him before is either deliberately affected or unconsciously borrowed, and later on the man is certain to change for the worse, to take up what\'s \'useful\' and throw his noble ideas away without regret, as the errors and infatuations of youth.","\u064a\u062e\u064a\u0644 \u0625\u0644\u064a \u0623\u0646 \u0627\u0644\u0631\u062c\u0627\u0644 \u0627\u0644\u0639\u0638\u0645\u0627\u0621 \u0644\u0627\u0628\u062f \u0623\u0646 \u064a\u0634\u0639\u0631\u0648\u0627 \u0639\u0644\u0649 \u0647\u0630\u0647 \u0627\u0644\u0623\u0631\u0636 \u0628\u062d\u0632\u0646 \u0639\u0638\u064a\u0645","God preserve you, my dear boy, from ever asking forgiveness for a fault from a woman you love.

Nothing will make her forgive you simply and directly, she\'ll humble you to the dust, bring forward things that have never happened, recall everything, forget nothing, add something of her own, and only then forgive you. And even the best, the best of them do it. She\'ll scrape up all the scrapings and load them on your head. They are ready to flay you alive, I tell you, every one of them, all these angels without whom we cannot live!

But I must point out one thing: if God does exist and really created the world, as we well know, he created it according to the principles of Euclidean geometry and made the human brain capable of grasping only three dimensions of space. Yet there have been and still are mathematicians and philosophers-among them some of the most outstanding-who doubt that the whole universe or, to put it more generally, all existence was created to fit Euclidean geometry; they even dare to conceive that two parallel lines that, according to Euclid, never do meet on earth do, in fact, meet somewhere in infinity. And so my dear boy, I\u2019ve decided that I am incapable of understanding of even that much, I cannot possibly understand about God.","\u0623\u0642\u0633\u0645 \u0623\u064a\u0647\u0627 \u0627\u0644\u0633\u0627\u062f\u0629 \u0623\u0646 \u0634\u062f\u0629 \u0627\u0644\u0625\u062f\u0627\u0631\u0643 \u0645\u0631\u0636 \u2013 \u0645\u0631\u0636 \u062d\u0642\u064a\u0642\u064a\u062e\u0637\u064a\u0631","In my opinion, if, as the result of certain combinations, Kepler\'s or Newton\'s discoveries could become known to people in no other way than by sacrificing the lives of one, or ten, or a hundred or more people who were hindering the discovery, or standing as an obstacle in its path, then Newton would have the right, and it would even be his duty... to remove those ten or a hundred people, in order to make his discoveries known to mankind. It by no means follows from this, incidentally, that Newton should have the right to kill anyone he pleases, whomever happens along, or to steal from the market every day. Further, I recall developing in my article the idea that all... well, let\'s say, the lawgivers and founders of mankind, starting from the most ancient and going on to the Lycurguses, the Solons, the Muhammads, the Napoleons, and so forth, that all of them to a man were criminals, from the fact alone that in giving a new law, they thereby violated the old one, held sacred by society and passed down from their fathers, and they certainly did not stop at shedding blood either, if it happened that blood (sometimes quite innocent and shed valiantly for the ancient law) could help them.","As a general rule, people, even the wicked, are much more naive and simple-hearted than we supposed. And we ourselves are, too.","Is there in the whole world a being who would have the right to forgive and could forgive? I don\'t want harmony. From love for humanity I don\'t want it.

I believe I made a mistake in beginning to write them, anyway I have felt ashamed all the time I\'ve been writing this story; so it\'s hardly literature so much as a corrective punishment. Why, to tell long stories, showing how I have spoiled my life through morally rotting in my corner, through lack of fitting environment, through divorce from real life, and rankling spite in my underground world, would certainly not be interesting; a novel needs a hero, and all the traits for an anti-hero are expressly gathered together here, and what matters most, it all produces an unpleasant impression, for we are all divorced from life, we are all cripples, every one of us, more or less. We are so divorced from it that we feel at once a sort of loathing for real life, and so cannot bear to be reminded of it. Why, we have come almost to looking upon real life as an effort, almost as hard work, and we are all privately agreed that it is better in books. And why do we fuss and fume sometimes? Why are we perverse and ask for something else? We don\'t know what ourselves. It would be the worse for us if our petulant prayers were answered. Come, try, give any one of us, for instance, a little more independence, untie our hands, widen the spheres of our activity, relax the control and we ... yes, I assure you ... we should be begging to be under control again at once. I know that you will very likely be angry with me for that, and will begin shouting and stamping. Speak for yourself, you will say, and for your miseries in your underground holes, and don\'t dare to say all of us-- excuse me, gentlemen, I am not justifying myself with that \\"all of us.\\" As for what concerns me in particular I have only in my life carried to an extreme what you have not dared to carry halfway, and what\'s more, you have taken your cowardice for good sense, and have found comfort in deceiving yourselves. So that perhaps, after all, there is more life in me than in you. Look into it more carefully! Why, we don\'t even know what living means now, what it is, and what it is called? Leave us alone without books and we shall be lost and in confusion at once. We shall not know what to join on to, what to cling to, what to love and what to hate, what to respect and what to despise. We are oppressed at being men--men with a real individual body and blood, we are ashamed of it, we think it a disgrace and try to contrive to be some sort of impossible generalised man. We are stillborn, and for generations past have been begotten, not by living fathers, and that suits us better and better. We are developing a taste for it. Soon we shall contrive to be born somehow from an idea. But enough; I don\'t want to write more from \\"Underground.\\"[The notes of this paradoxalist do not end here, however.

At the same time there were and are even now geometers and philosophers, even some of the most outstanding among them, who doubt that the whole universe, or, even more broadly, the whole of being, was created purely in accordance with Euclidean geometry; they even dare to dream that two parallel lines, which according to Euclid cannot possibly meet on earth, may perhaps meet somewhere in infinity. I, my dear, have come to the conclusion that if I cannot understand even that, then it is not for me to understand about God. I humbly confess that I do not have any ability to resolve such questions, I have a Euclidean mind, an earthly mind, and therefore it is not for us to resolve things that are not of this world. And I advise you never to think about it, Alyosha my friend, and most especially about whether God exists or not. All such questions are completely unsuitable to a mind created with a concept of only three dimensions. And so, I accept God, not only willingly, but moreover I also accept his wisdom and his purpose, which are completely unknown to us; I believe in order, in the meaning of life, I believe in eternal harmony, in which we are all supposed to merge, I believe in the Word for whom the universe is yearning, and who himself was \'with God,\' who himself is God, and so on and so forth, to infinity. Many words have been invented on the subject. It seems I\'m already on a good path, eh? And now imagine that in the final outcome I do not accept this world of God\'s, created by God, that I do not accept and cannot agree to accept. With one reservation: I have a childlike conviction that the sufferings will be healed and smoothed over, that the whole offensive comedy of human contradictions will disappear like a pitiful mirage, a vile concoction of man\'s Euclidean mind, feeble and puny as an atom, and that ultimately, at the world\'s finale, in the moment of eternal harmony, there will occur and be revealed something so precious that it will suffice for all hearts, to allay all indignation, to redeem all human villainy, all bloodshed; it will suffice not only to make forgiveness possible, but also to justify everything that has happened with men--let this, let all of this come true and be revealed, but I do not accept it and do not want to accept it! Let the parallel lines even meet before my own eyes: I shall look and say, yes, they meet, and still I will not accept it.","What does reason know? Reason only knows what it has succeeded in learning...","There are certain things in a man\'s past which he does not divulge to everybody but, perhaps, only to his friends. Again there are certain things he will not divulge even to his friends; he will divulge them perhaps only to himself, and that, too, as a secret. But, finally, there are things which he is afraid to divulge even to himself, and every decent man has quite an accumulation of such things in his mind. I can put it even this way: the more decent a man is, the larger will the number of such things be.","Do you believe in a future everlasting life?No, not in a future everlasting but in an everlasting life here.

People talk to you a great deal about your education, but some good, sacred memory, preserved from childhood, is perhaps the best education.","I suddenly felt that it was all the same to me whether the world existed or whether there had never been anything at all: I began to feel with all my being that there was nothing existing. At first I fancied that many things had existed in the past, but afterwards I guessed that there never had been anything in the past either, but that it had only seemed so for some reason. Little by little I guessed that there would be nothing in the future either. Then I left off being angry with people and almost ceased to notice them. Indeed this showed itself even in the pettiest trifles: I used, for instance, to knock against people in the street. And not so much from being lost in thought: what had I to think about? I had almost given up thinking by that time; nothing mattered to me. If at least I had solved my problems! Oh, I had not settled one of them, and how many there were! But I gave up caring about anything, and all the problems disappeared.","If I had a reader and he had read all I have written so far of my adventures, there would be certainly no need to inform him that I am not created for any sort of society. The trouble is I don\'t know how to behave in company. If I go anywhere among a great many people I always have a feeling as though I were being electrified by so many eyes looking at me. It positively makes me shrivel up, physically shrivel up, even in such places as the theatre, to say nothing of private houses. I did not know how to behave with dignity in these gambling saloons and assemblies; I either was still, inwardly upbraiding myself for my excessive mildness and politeness, or I suddenly got up and did something rude. And meanwhile all sorts of worthless fellows far inferior to me knew how to behave with wonderful aplomb-- and that\'s what really exasperated me above everything, so that I lost my self-possession more and more. I may say frankly, even at that time, if the truth is to be told, the society there, and even winning money at cards, had become revolting and a torture to me. Positively a torture. I did, of course, derive acute enjoyment from it, but this enjoyment was at the cost of torture.","\u064a\u0635\u0639\u0628 \u0639\u0644\u0649 \u0627\u0644\u0645\u0631\u0621 \u0623\u0646 \u064a\u062a\u062e\u064a\u0644 \u0644\u0645\u0627\u0630\u0627 \u0648\u0643\u064a\u0641 \u064a\u0635\u0628\u062d \u0627\u0644\u0625\u0646\u0633\u0627\u0646 \u0639\u0627\u0634\u0642\u0627\u064b\u061f","\u0625\u0646\u0646\u064a \u0623\u062b\u0631\u062b\u0631 \u0643\u062b\u064a\u0631\u0627\u064b . . \u0648\u0644\u0623\u0646\u0646\u064a \u0623\u0643\u062b\u0631 \u0627\u0644\u0643\u0644\u0627\u0645 \u0644\u0627 \u0623\u0639\u0645\u0644 \u0634\u064a\u0626\u0627\u064b . . \u0623\u0648 \u0639\u0644\u0649 \u0627\u0644\u0623\u0635\u062d \u0625\u0646\u0646\u064a \u0623\u062b\u0631\u062b\u0631 \u0644\u0627\u0641\u062a\u0642\u0627\u0631\u064a \u0625\u0644\u0649 \u0627\u0644\u0639\u0645\u0644","But what can a decent man speak of with most pleasure?Answer: Of himself.Well, so I will talk about myself.","\u0645\u0627 \u0643\u0627\u0646 \u0630\u0644\u0643 \u0645\u0646\u0647\u0627 \u0625\u0644\u0627 \u0642\u0648\u0644\u0627\u064b \u0637\u0627\u0626\u0634\u0627\u064b..........\u064a\u062c\u0628 \u0623\u0646 \u0646\u063a\u0641\u0631 \u0627\u0644\u0623\u0642\u0648\u0627\u0644 \u0627\u0644\u0637\u0627\u0626\u0634\u0629\u060c \u0644\u0623\u0646\u0647\u0627 \u062a\u0647\u062f\u0649\u0621 \u0627\u0644\u0646\u0641\u0633...\u0648\u0628\u062f\u0648\u0646\u0647\u0627 \u064a\u0635\u0628\u062d \u0623\u0644\u0645 \u0627\u0644\u0625\u0646\u0633\u0627\u0646 \u0623\u0634\u062f \u0645\u0646 \u0623\u0646 \u064a\u064f\u0637\u0627\u0642","\u064a\u0627\u0625\u062e\u0648\u062a\u0649\u060c \u0644\u0627 \u062a\u062d\u062a\u0642\u0631\u0648\u0627 \u0627\u0644\u0628\u0634\u0631 \u0644\u062e\u0637\u0627\u064a\u0627\u0647\u0645\u060c \u0623\u062d\u0628\u0648\u0647\u0645 \u0631\u063a\u0645 \u062e\u0637\u0627\u064a\u0627\u0647\u0645\u060c \u0641\u0628\u0630\u0644\u0643 \u062a\u0639\u0631\u0641\u0648\u0646 \u0627\u0644\u0645\u062d\u0628\u0629 \u0627\u0644\u0639\u0638\u0645\u0649..\u0648\u0625\u0630\u0627 \u0645\u0644\u0623\u0643 \u062e\u0628\u062b \u0627\u0644\u0628\u0634\u0631 \u0627\u0633\u062a\u064a\u0627\u0621 \u0648\u0623\u0644\u0645\u0627 \u0639\u0646\u064a\u0641\u0627..\u060c \u062d\u062a\u0649 \u0635\u0631\u062a \u062a\u062a\u0645\u0646\u0649 \u0645\u0639\u0627\u0642\u0628\u0629 \u0627\u0644\u0645\u062c\u0631\u0645\u064a\u0646 \u0625\u0646\u062a\u0642\u0627\u0645\u0627\u060c \u0641\u0635\u0646 \u0646\u0641\u0633\u0643 \u0645\u0646 \u0647\u0630\u0647 \u0627\u0644\u0639\u0627\u0637\u0641\u0629 \u0628\u0643\u0644 \u0645\u0627 \u062a\u0645\u0644\u0643 \u0645\u0646 \u0642\u0648\u0629\u060c \u0648\u0627\u0628\u062d\u062b \u0644\u0646\u0641\u0633\u0643 \u0639\u0646 \u0622\u0644\u0627\u0645 \u0645\u0628\u0627\u0634\u0631\u0629 \u0643\u0623\u0646\u0643 \u0645\u0633\u0626\u0648\u0644 \u0639\u0646 \u062c\u0631\u0627\u0626\u0645 \u0647\u0624\u0644\u0627\u0621 \u0627\u0644\u0646\u0627\u0633 \u0623\u0642\u0628\u0644 \u0647\u0630\u0647 \u0627\u0644\u0622\u0644\u0627\u0645 \u0648\u062a\u062d\u0645\u0644\u0647\u0627.\u0641\u0630\u0644\u0643 \u064a\u0647\u062f\u0626 \u0642\u0644\u0628\u0643 \u0648\u064a\u0637\u0645\u0626\u0646 \u0646\u0641\u0633\u0643 \u0633\u0648\u0641 \u062a\u062f\u0631\u0643 \u0623\u0646\u0643 \u0622\u062b\u0645 \u0641\u0639\u0644\u0627\u060c \u0644\u0623\u0646\u0643 \u0643\u0646\u062a \u062a\u0633\u062a\u0637\u064a\u0639 \u0623\u0646 \u062a\u0647\u062f\u0626 \u0647\u0624\u0644\u0627\u0621 \u0627\u0644\u0646\u0627\u0633 \u0628\u0627\u0644\u0642\u062f\u0648\u0629","I got entangled in my own data, and my conclusion directly contradicts the original idea from which I start.

If up to now, for example, I have been told to \'love my neighbor,\' and I did love him, what came of it?. . . What came of it was that I tore my caftan in two, shared it with my neighbor, and we were both left half naked, in accordance with the Russian proverb which says: If you chase several hares at once, you won\'t overtake any one of them. But science says: Love yourself before all, because everything in the world is based on self-interest. If you love only yourself, you will set your affairs up properly, and your caftan will also remain in one piece. And economic truth adds that the more properly arranged personal affairs and, so to speak, whole caftans there are in society, the firmer its foundations are and the better arranged its common cause. It follows that by acquiring for everyone, as it were, and working so that my neighbor will have something more than a torn caftan, not from private, isolated generosities now, but as a result of universal prosperity.","In every idea emanating from genius, or even in every serious human idea -- born in the human brain -- there always remains something -- some sediment -- which cannot be expressed to others, though one wrote volumes and lectured upon it for five-and-thirty years. There is always a something, a remnant, which will never come out from your brain, but will remain there with you, and you alone, for ever and ever, and you will die, perhaps, without having imparted what may be the very essence of your idea to a single living soul.","Why did you come in to-night with your heads in the air? \'Make way, we are coming! Give us every right and don\'t you dare breathe a word before us. Pay us every sort of respect, such as no one\'s ever heard of, and we shall treat you worse than the lowest lackey!\' They strive for justice, they stand on their rights, and yet they\'ve slandered him like infidels in their article. We demand, we don\'t ask, and you will get no gratitude from us, because you are acting for the satisfaction of your own conscience! Queer sort of reasoning!... He has not borrowed money from you, he doesn\'t owe you anything, so what are you reckoning on, if not his gratitude? So how can you repudiate it? Lunatics! They regard society as savage and inhuman, because it cries shame on the seduced girl; but if you think society inhuman, you must think that the girl suffers from the censure of society, and if she does, how is it you expose her to society in the newspapers and expect her not to suffer? Lunatics! Vain creatures! They don\'t believe in God, they don\'t believe in Christ! Why, you are so eaten up with pride and vanity that you\'ll end by eating up one another, that\'s what I prophesy. Isn\'t that topsy-turvydom, isn\'t it infamy?","I\'ve been sitting here now, and do you know what I was saying to myself? If I did not believe in life, if I were to lose faith in the woman I love, if I were to lose faith in the order of things, even if I were to become convinced, on the contrary, that everything is a disorderly, damned, and perhaps devilish chaos, if I were struck even by all the horrors of human disillusionment--still I would want to live, and as long as I have bent to this cup, I will not tear myself from it until I\'ve drunk it all. However, by the age of thirty, I will probably drop the cup, even if I haven\'t emptied it, and walk away...I don\'t know where. But until my thirtieth year, I know this for certain, my youth will overcome everything--all disillusionment, all aversion to live. I\'ve asked myself many times: is there such despair in the world as could overcome this wild and perhaps indecent thirst for life in me, and have decided that apparently there is not--that is, once again, until my thirtieth year, after which I myself shall want no more, so it seems to me. Some snotty-nosed, consumptive moralists, poets especially, often call this thirst for life base. True, it\'s a feature of the Karamazovs, to some extent, this thirst for life despite all; it must be sitting in you too; but why is it base? There is still an awful lot of centripetal force on our planet, Alyosha. I want to live, and I do live, even if it be against logic. Though I do not believe in the order of things, still the sticky little leaves that come out in the spring are dear to me, the blue sky is dear to me, some people are dear to me, whom one loves sometimes, would you believe it, without even knowing why; some human deeds are dear to me, which one has perhaps long ceased believing in, but still honors with one\'s heart, out of old habit...I want to go to Europe, Alyosha, I\'ll go straight from here. Of course I know that I will only be going to a graveyard, but to the most, the most previous graveyard, that\'s the thing! The precious dead lie there, each stone over them speaks of such ardent past life, of such passionate faith in their deeds, their truth, their struggle, and their science, that I--this I know beforehand--will fall to the ground and kiss those stones and weep over them--being wholeheartedly convinced, at the same time, that it has all long been a graveyard and nothing more. And I will not weep from despair, but simply because I will be happy in my shed tears. I will be drunk with my own tenderness. Sticky spring leaves, the blue sky--I love them, that\'s all! Such things you love not with your mind, not with logic, but with your insides, your guts, you love your first young strength...","\u0625\u0646 \u0627\u0644\u0641\u0642\u0631 \u0644\u064a\u0633 \u062e\u0637\u064a\u0626\u0629, \u0648\u0625\u0646\u0645\u0627 \u0627\u0644\u062e\u0637\u064a\u0626\u0629 \u0623\u0646 \u064a\u0643\u0648\u0646 \u0627\u0644\u0645\u0631\u0621 \u063a\u0646\u064a\u0627 \u0641\u064a\u064f\u0647\u064a\u0646 \u0627\u0644\u0622\u062e\u0631\u064a\u0646","Every one is really responsible to all men for all men and for everything.","Talk nonsense, but talk your own nonsense, and I\'ll kiss you for it.

For in order to begin to act, one must first be completely at ease, so that no more doubts remain. Well, and how am I, for example, to set myself at ease? Where are the primary causes on which I can rest, where are my bases? Where am I going to get them? I exercise thinking, and, consequently, for me every primary cause immediately drags with it yet another, still more primary one, and so on ad infinitum.

He would even risk his cakes and would deliberately desire the most fatal rubbish, the most uneconomical absurdity, simply to introduce into all this positive good sense his fatal fantastic element. It is just his fantastic dreams, his vulgar folly that he will desire to retain, simply in order to prove to himself--as though that were so necessary-- that men still are men and not the keys of a piano, which the laws of nature threaten to control so completely that soon one will be able to desire nothing but by the calendar. And that is not all: even if man really were nothing but a piano-key, even if this were proved to him by natural science and mathematics, even then he would not become reasonable, but would purposely do something perverse out of simple ingratitude, simply to gain his point. And if he does not find means he will contrive destruction and chaos, will contrive sufferings of all sorts, only to gain his point!","Oh, you may be sure that Columbus was happy not when he had discovered America, but when he was discovering it. Take my word for it, the highest moment if his happiness was just three days before the discovery of the New World, when the mutinous crew were on the point of returning to Europe in despair. It wasn\'t the New World that mattered, even if it had fallen to pieces.  Columbus died almost without seeing it; and not really knowing what he had discovered. It\'s life that matters, nothing but life -- the process of discovering, the everlasting and perpetual process, not the discovery itself, at all.","I have in my own life merely carried to the extreme that which you have never ventured to carry even halfway ; and what\'s more, you\'ve regarded your cowardice as prudence, and found comfortin deceiving yourselves.

It is not miracles that bring a realist to faith. A true realist, if he is not a believer, will always find in himself the strength and ability not to believe in miracles as well, and if a miracle stands before him as an irrefutable fact, he will sooner doubt his own senses than admit the fact. And even if he does admit it, he will admit it as a fact of nature that was previously unknown to him. In the realist, faith is not born from miracles, but miracles from faith. Once the realist comes to believe, then, precisely because of his realism, he must also allow for miracles. The Apostle Thomas declared that he would not believe until he saw, and when he saw, he said: \\"My Lord and My God!\\" Was it the miracle that made him believe? Most likely not, but he believed first and foremost because he wished to believe, and maybe already fully believed in his secret heart even as he was saying: \\"I will not believe until I see.","All my life I did not want it to be only words. This is why I lived, because I kept not wanting it. And now, too, every day I want it not to be words.","love equates people","Because reading books and having them bound represent two enormously different stages of development. First, people gradually get used to reading, over centuries naturally, but they don\'t take care of their books and toss them around. Having books bound signifies respect for the book; it indicates that people not only love to read, but they view it an important occupation. Nowhere in Russia has that stage been reached. Europe has been binding its books for sometime.","It is precisely that requirement of shared worship that has been the principal source of suffering for individual man and the human race since the beginning of history. In their efforts to impose universal worship, men have unsheathed their swords and killed one another. They have invented gods and challenged each other: \\"Discard your gods and worship mine or I will destroy both your gods and you!","he was partly a young man of our time - that is, honest by nature, demanding the truth, seeking it and believing in it, and in that belief demanding immediate participation in it with all the strength of his soul; demanding an immediate deed, with an unfailing desire to sacrifice everything for this deed, even life. Although, unfortunately, these young men do not understand that the sacrifice of life is, perhaps, the easiest of all sacrifices in many cases, while to sacrifice, for example, five or six years of their ebulliently youthful life to hard, difficult studies, to learning, in order to increase tenfold their strength to serve the very truth and the very deed that they loved and set out to accomplish - such sacrifice is often almost beyond the strength of many of them.","Grandmother was always regretting the old days-she was younger in old days,and the sun was warmer in old days,and cream did not turn so sour in old days-it was always the old days!","Let the readers do some of the work themselves","I could have done even better, miss, and I\'d know a lot more, if it wasn\'t for my destiny ever since childhood.

For we are not holier than those in the world because we have come here and shut ourselves within these walls, but, on the contrary, anyone who comes here, by the very fact that he has come, already knows himself to be worse than all those who are in the world, worse than all on earth...And the longer a monk lives within his walls, the more keenly he must be aware of it. For otherwise he had no reason to come here. But when he knows that he is not only worse than all those in the world, but is also guilty before all people, on behalf of all and for all, for all human sins, the world\'s and each person\'s, only then will the goal of our unity be achieved. For you must know, my dear ones, that each of us is undoubtedly guilty on behalf of all and for all on earth, not only because of the common guilt of the world, but personally, each one of us, for all people and for each person on this earth. This knowledge is the crown of the monk\'s path, and of every man\'s path on earth. For monks are not a different sort of men, but only such as all men on earth ought also to be. Only then will our hearts be moved to a love that is infinite, universal, and that knows no satiety. Then each of us will be able to gain the whole world by love and wash away the world\'s sins with his tears...Let each of you keep close company with his heart, let each of you confess to himself untiringly. Do not be afraid of your sin, even when you perceive it, provided you are repentant, but do not place conditions on God. Again I say, do not be proud. Do not be proud before the lowly, do not be proud before the great either. And do not hate those who reject you, disgrace you, revile you, and slander you. Do not hate atheists, teachers of evil, materialists, not even those among them who are wicked, nor those who are good, for many of them are good, especially in our time. Remember them thus in your prayers: save, Lord, those whom there is no one to pray for, save also those who do not want to pray to you. And add at once: it is not in my pride that I pray for it, Lord, for I myself am more vile than all...Love God\'s people, do not let newcomers draw your flock away, for if in your laziness and disdainful pride, in your self-interest most of all, you fall asleep, they will come from all sides and lead your flock away. Teach the Gospel to the people untiringly...Do not engage in usury...Do not love silver and gold, do not keep it...Believe, and hold fast to the banner. Raise it high...","Sometimes I\'d hate to talk to anyone, and at other times I\'d not only talk to people, but would even take it into my head to be friends with them.","These, gentlemen, are my rules: if I don\'t succeed, I keep trying; if I do succeed, I keep quiet; and in any case I don\'t undermine anyone. I\'m not an intriguer, and I\'m proud of it. I wouldn\'t make a good diplomat. They also say, gentlemen, that the bird flies to the fowler. That\'s true, and I\'m ready to agree: but who is the fowler here, and who is the bird? That\'s still a question, gentlemen!","Listen,\\" Kirillov stopped, gazing before him with fixed, ecstatic eyes. \\"Listen to a big idea: There was one day on earth, and in the middle of the earth stood three crosses. One on a cross believed so much that he said to another: \'This day you will be with me in paradise.\' They day ended, they both died, went, and did not find either paradise or resurrection. What had been said would not prove true. Listen: this man was the highest on all the earth, he constituted what it was to live for. Without this man the whole planet with everything on it is--madness only. There has not been one like Him before or since, not ever, even to the point of miracle. This is the miracle, that there has not been and never will be such a one. And if so, if the laws of nature did not pity even This One, did not pity even their own miracle, but made Him, too, live amidst a lie and die for a lie, then the whole planet is a lie, and stands upon a lie and a stupid mockery.

They marvelled and were horrified, and began tobe split up and divided. They formed into unions, but it wasagainst one another. Reproaches, upbraidings followed. They came to know shame, and shame brought them tovirtue. The conception of honour sprang up, and every unionbegan waving its flags. They began torturing animals, andthe animals withdrew from them into the forests and becamehostile to them. They began to struggle for separation, forisolation, for individuality, for mine and thine. They beganto talk in different languages. They became acquainted withsorrow and loved sorrow; they thirsted for suffering, and saidthat truth could only be attained through suffering. Thenscience appeared. As they became wicked they began talkingof brotherhood and humanitarianism, and understood thoseideas. As they became criminal, they invented justice anddrew up whole legal codes in order to observe it, and toensure their being kept, set up a guillotine. They hardlyremembered what they had lost, in fact refused to believe thatthey had ever been happy and innocent. They even laughedat the possibility o this happiness in the past, and called it adream. They could not even imagine it in definite form andshape, but, strange and wonderful to relate, though they lostall faith in their past happiness and called it a legend, they solonged to be happy and innocent once more that theysuccumbed to this desire like children, made an idol of it, setup temples and worshipped their own idea, their own desire;though at the same time they fully believed that it wasunattainable and could not be realised, yet they bowed downto it and adored it with tears! Nevertheless, if it could havehappened that they had returned to the innocent and happycondition which they had lost, and if someone had shown itto them again and had asked them whether they wanted to goback to it, they would certainly have refused.

Roman Catholicism believes that the Church cannot exist on earth without universal temporal power, and cries: Non possumus! In my opinion, Roman Catholicism isn\'t even a religion, but most decidedly a continuation of the Holy Roman Empire, and everything in it is subordinated to that idea, beginning with faith. The Pope seized the earth, an earthly throne and took up the sword; and since then everything has gone on in the same way, except that they\'ve added lies, fraud, deceit, fanaticism, superstition wickedness. They have trifled with the most sacred, truthful, innocent, ardent feelings of the people, have bartered it all for money, for base temporal power. And isn\'t this the teaching of Antichrist? Isn\'t it clear that atheism had to come from them? And it did come from them, from Roman Catholicism itself! Atheism originated first of all with them: how could they believe in themselves? It gained ground because of abhorrence of them; it is the child of their lies and their spiritual impotence! Atheism!

Over him the heavenly dome, full of quiet, shining stars, hung boundlessly. From the zenith to the horizon the still-dim Milky Way stretched its double strand. Night, fresh and quiet, almost unstirring, enveloped the earth. The white towers and golden domes of the church gleamed in the sapphire sky. The luxuriant autumn flowers in the flowerbeds near the house had fallen asleep until morning. The silence of the earth seemed to merge with the silence of the heavens, the mystery of the earth touched the mystery of the stars... Alyosha stood gazing and suddenly, as if he had been cut down, threw himself to the earth.He did not know why he was embracing it, he did not try to understand why he longed so irresistibly to kiss it, to kiss all of it, but he was kissing it, weeping, sobbing, and watering it with his tears, and he vowed ecstatically to love it, to love it unto ages of ages. \\"Water the earth with the tears of your joy, and love those tears...,\\" rang in his soul. What was he weeping for? Oh, in his rapture he wept even for the stars that shone on him from the abyss, and \\"he was not ashamed of this ecstasy.\\" It was as if threads from all those innumerable worlds of God all came together in his soul, and it was trembling all over, \\"touching other worlds.\\" He wanted to forgive everyone and for everything, and to ask forgiveness, oh, not for himself! but for all and for everything, \\"as others are asking for me,\\" rang again in his soul. But with each moment he felt clearly and almost tangibly something as firm and immovable as this heavenly vault descend into his soul. Some sort of idea, as it were, was coming to reign in his mind-now for the whole of his life and unto ages of ages. He fell to the earth a weak youth and rose up a fighter, steadfast for the rest of his life, and he knew it and felt it suddenly, in that very moment of his ecstasy. Never, never in all his life would Alyosha forget that moment. \\"Someone visited my soul in that hour,\\" he would say afterwards, with firm belief in his words...","we are all privately agreed that it is better in books","Do you know that centuries will pass and mankind will proclaim with the mouth of its wisdom and science that there is no crime, and therefore no sin, but only hungry men?

I have read it once, and find that I don\'t remember the events of the book very well--or even all the principal characters. But mostly the \'portrait of a truly beautiful person\' that dostoevsky supposedly set out to write in that book. And I remember how Myshkin seemed so simple when I began the book, but by the end, I realized how I didn\'t understand him at all. the things he did. Maybe when I read it again it will be different. But the plot of these dostoevsky books can hold such twists and turns for the first-time reader-- I guess that\'s b/c he was writing most of these books as serials that had to have cliffhangers and such. But I make marks in my books, mostly at parts where I see the author\'s philosophical points standing in the most stark relief. My copy of Moby Dick is positively full of these marks. The Idiot, I find has a few... Part 3, Section 5. The sickly Ippolit is reading from his \'Explanation\' or whatever its called. He says his convictions are not tied to him being condemned to death. It\'s important for him to describe, of happiness: \\"you may be sure that Columbus was happy not when he had discovered America, but when he was discovering it.\\" That it\'s the process of life--not the end or accomplished goals in it--that matter. Well. Easier said than lived! Part 3, Section 6. more of Ippolit talking--about a christian mindset. He references Jesus\'s parable of The Word as seeds that grow in men, couched in a description of how people are interrelated over time; its a picture of a multiplicity. Later in this section, he relates looking at a painting of Christ being taken down from the cross, at Rogozhin\'s house. The painting produced in him an intricate metaphor of despair over death \\"in the form of a huge machine of the most modern construction which, dull and insensible, has aimlessly clutched, crushed, and swallowed up a great priceless Being, a Being worth all nature and its laws, worth the whole earth, which was created perhaps solely for the sake of the advent of this Being.\\" The way Ippolit\'s ideas are configured, here, reminds me of the writings of Gilles Deleuze. And the phrasing just sort of remidns me of the way everyone feels--many people feel crushed by the incomprehensible machine, in life. Many people feel martyred in their very minor ways. And it makes me think of the concept that a narrative religion like Christianity uniquely allows for a kind of socialized or externalized, shared experience of subjectivity. Like, we all know the story of this man--and it feels like our own stories at the same time. Part 4, Section 7. Myshkin\'s excitement (leading to a seizure) among the Epanchin\'s dignitary guests when he talks about what the nobility needs to become (\\"servants in order to be leaders\\"). I\'m drawn to things like this because it\'s affirming, I guess, for me: \\"it really is true that we\'re absurd, that we\'re shallow, have bad habits, that we\'re bored, that we don\'t know how to look at things, that we can\'t understand; we\'re all like that.\\" And of course he finds a way to make that into a good thing. which, it\'s pointed out by scholars, is very important to Dostoevsky philosophy--don\'t deny the earthly passions and problems in yourself, but accept them and incorporate them into your whole person. Me, I\'m still working on that one.","\u064a\u0627 \u0631\u0628! \u0627\u0642\u0628\u0644\u0646\u064a \u0631\u063a\u0645 \u062d\u0637\u062a\u064a\u060c \u0648\u0644\u0643\u0646 \u0644\u0627 \u062a\u062d\u0643\u0645 \u0639\u0644\u064a\u0651. \u0627\u0644\u0644\u0647\u0645 \u0627\u0633\u0645\u062d \u0644\u064a \u0623\u0646 \u0623\u062c\u064a\u0621 \u0625\u0644\u064a\u0643 \u062f\u0648\u0646 \u0623\u0646 \u0623\u0645\u062b\u0644 \u0623\u0645\u0627\u0645 \u0645\u062d\u0643\u0645\u062a\u0643... \u0644\u0627 \u062a\u062d\u0643\u0645 \u0639\u0644\u064a\u0651\u060c \u0645\u0627 \u062f\u0645\u062a \u0642\u062f \u062d\u0643\u0645\u062a \u0639\u0644\u0649 \u0646\u0641\u0633\u064a \u0628\u0646\u0641\u0633\u064a.... \u0644\u0627 \u062a\u062d\u0643\u0645 \u0639\u0644\u064a\u0651\u060c \u0644\u0623\u0646\u0646\u064a \u0623\u062d\u0628\u0643 \u064a\u0627 \u0631\u0628! \u0627\u0644\u0644\u0647\u0645 \u0625\u0646\u0646\u064a \u062e\u0628\u064a\u062b \u062f\u0646\u064a\u0621\u060c \u0648\u0644\u0643\u0646\u064a \u0623\u062d\u0628\u0643\u060c \u0648\u062d\u062a\u0649 \u0641\u064a \u0627\u0644\u062c\u062d\u064a\u0645\u060c \u0625\u0630\u0627 \u0623\u0646\u062a \u0623\u0631\u0633\u0644\u062a\u0646\u064a \u0625\u0644\u0649 \u0627\u0644\u062c\u062d\u064a\u0645\u060c \u0633\u0623\u0638\u0644 \u0623\u062d\u0628\u0643\u060c \u0648\u0633\u0623\u0638\u0644 \u0623\u0647\u062a\u0641 \u0644\u0643 \u0628\u062d\u0628\u064a \u0625\u0644\u0649 \u0627\u0644\u0623\u0628\u062f\u060c \u0648\u0644\u0643\u0646 \u062f\u0639 \u0644\u064a \u0623\u0646 \u0623\u062d\u0628 \u062d\u0628\u064a \u0627\u0644\u0623\u0631\u0636\u064a \u062d\u062a\u0649 \u0627\u0644\u0646\u0647\u0627\u064a\u0629.. \u0625\u0633\u0645\u062d \u0644\u064a \u0623\u0646 \u0627\u0638\u0644 \u0623\u062d\u0628\u060c \u0641\u064a \u0647\u0630\u0647 \u0627\u0644\u062d\u064a\u0627\u0629 \u0627\u0644\u062f\u0646\u064a\u0627\u060c \u062e\u0645\u0633 \u0633\u0627\u0639\u0627\u062a \u0623\u062e\u0631\u0649\u060c \u0625\u0644\u0649 \u0623\u0646 \u062a\u0637\u0644\u0639 \u0634\u0645\u0633\u0643 \u0627\u0644\u062f\u0627\u0641\u0626\u0629.. \u0625\u0646\u0646\u064a \u0623\u062d\u0628 \u0645\u0644\u0643\u0629 \u0642\u0644\u0628\u064a\u060c \u0648\u0644\u0627 \u0623\u0645\u0644\u0643 \u0623\u0646 \u0623\u0645\u062a\u0646\u0639 \u0639\u0646 \u062d\u0628\u0647\u0627\u060c \u0627\u0644\u0644\u0647\u0645 \u0625\u0646\u0643 \u062a\u0631\u0627\u0646\u064a \u0643\u0644\u064a \u0641\u064a \u0647\u0630\u0647 \u0627\u0644\u0644\u062d\u0638\u0629\u060c \u0633\u0648\u0641 \u0623\u0647\u0631\u0639 \u0625\u0644\u064a\u0647\u0627\u060c \u0641\u0623\u0631\u062a\u0645\u064a \u0639\u0646\u062f \u0642\u062f\u0645\u064a\u0647\u0627\u060c \u0648\u0623\u0642\u0648\u0644 \u0644\u0647\u0627: \u0644\u0642\u062f \u0643\u0646\u062a \u0639\u0644\u0649 \u062d\u0642 \u062d\u064a\u0646 \u0646\u0628\u0630\u062a\u064a\u0646\u064a\u060c \u0648\u062f\u0627\u0639\u0627.. \u0625\u0646\u0633\u064a \u0636\u062d\u064a\u062a\u0643\u060c \u0648\u0644\u0627 \u062a\u062f\u0639\u064a \u0644\u0630\u0643\u0631\u0627\u064a \u0623\u0646 \u062a\u0639\u0630\u0628\u0643 \u064a\u0648\u0645\u0627","A fool is always pleased with what he says, and, besides, he always says more than he needs to.","What is honour, my dear, when you have nothing to eat?","\u0625\u0630 \u0645\u0627 \u0627\u0644\u0639\u0630\u0627\u0628 \u0648\u0627\u0644\u0623\u0644\u0645 ... \u0633\u0648\u0649 \u0627\u0644\u0645\u062d\u0631\u0643 \u0627\u0644\u0648\u062d\u064a\u062f \u0644\u0644\u0648\u0639\u064a","Feeling my own humiliation in my heart like the sharp prick of a needle.","On our earth we can only love sincerely with suffering and through suffering.

sinner, that\'s true,\\" he added almost solemnly, and your worst sin is that you have destroyed and betrayed yourself for nothing. Isn\'t that fearful? Isn\'t it fearful that you are living in this filth which you loathe so, and at the same time you know yourself (you\'ve only to open your eyes) that you are not helping anyone by it, not saving anyone from anything?","I heard exactly the same thing, a long time ago to be sure, from a doctor,\\" the elder remarked. \\"He was then an old man, and unquestionably intelligent. He spoke just as frankly as you, humorously, but with a sorrowful humor. \'I love mankind,\' he said, \'but I am amazed at myself: the more I love mankind in general, the less I love people in particular, that is, individually, as separate persons. In my dreams,\' he said, \'I often went so far as to think passionately of serving mankind, and, it may be, would really have gone to the cross for people if it were somehow suddenly necessary, and yet I am incapable of living in the same room with anyone even for two days, this I know from experience. As soon as someone is there, close to me, his personality oppresses my self-esteem and restricts my freedom. In twenty-four hours I can begin to hate even the best of men: one because he takes too long eating his dinner, another because he has a cold and keeps blowing his nose. I become the enemy of people the moment they touch me,\' he said. \'On the other hand, it has always happened that the more I hate people individually, the more ardent becomes my love for humanity as a whole.","Fear of aesthetics is the first sign of powerlessness","Well, what, what new thing can they say to me that I don\'t know myself? And is that the point? The point here is that--one turn of the wheel, and everything changes, and these same moralizers will be the first (I\'m sure of it) to come with friendly jokes to congratulate me. And they won\'t all turn away from me as they do now. Spit on them all! What am I now? Z\xe9ro. What may I be tomorrow? Tomorrow I may rise from the dead and begin to live anew! I may find the man in me before he\'s lost!","In place of the clear and rigid ancient law, You [oh Lord] made man decide about good and evil for himself, with no other guidance than Your example. But did it never occur to You that man would disregard Your example, even question it, as well as Your truth, when he was subjected to so fearful a burden as freedom of choice?","But man is so partial to systems and abstract conclusions that he is ready to distort the truth, ready to hear nor see anything, as long as he can justify his logic.","(Ivan) Hold your tongue, or I\'ll kill you!(The devil) You\'ll kill me? No, excuse me, I will speak. I came to treat myself to that pleasure. Oh, I love the dreams of my ardent young friends, quivering with eagerness for life! \'There are new men,\' you decided last spring, when you were meaning to come here, \'they propose to destroy everything and begin with cannibalism. Stupid fellows! they didn\'t ask my advice! I maintain that nothing need be destroyed, that we only need to destroy the idea of God in man, that\'s how we have to set to work. It\'s that, that we must begin with. Oh, blind race of men who have no understanding! As soon as men have all of them denied God -- and I believe that period, analogous with geological periods, will come to pass -- the old conception of the universe will fall of itself without cannibalism, and, what\'s more, the old morality, and everything will begin anew. Men will unite to take from life all it can give, but only for joy and happiness in the present world. Man will be lifted up with a spirit of divine Titanic pride and the man-god will appear. From hour to hour extending his conquest of nature infinitely by his will and his science, man will feel such lofty joy from hour to hour in doing it that it will make up for all his old dreams of the joys of heaven. Everyone will know that he is mortal and will accept death proudly and serenely like a god. His pride will teach him that it\'s useless for him to repine at life\'s being a moment, and he will love his brother without need of reward. Love will be sufficient only for a moment of life, but the very consciousness of its momentariness will intensify its fire, which now is dissipated in dreams of eternal love beyond the grave\'... and so on and so on in the same style. Charming!Ivan sat with his eyes on the floor, and his hands pressed to his ears, but he began trembling all over. The voice continued.(The devil) The question now is, my young thinker reflected, is it possible that such a period will ever come? If it does, everything is determined and humanity is settled for ever. But as, owing to man\'s inveterate stupidity, this cannot come about for at least a thousand years, everyone who recognises the truth even now may legitimately order his life as he pleases, on the new principles. In that sense, \'all things are lawful\' for him. What\'s more, even if this period never comes to pass, since there is anyway no God and no immortality, the new man may well become the man-god, even if he is the only one in the whole world, and promoted to his new position, he may lightheartedly overstep all the barriers of the old morality of the old slaveman, if necessary. There is no law for God. Where God stands, the place is holy. Where I stand will be at once the foremost place... \'all things are lawful\' and that\'s the end of it! That\'s all very charming; but if you want to swindle why do you want a moral sanction for doing it? But that\'s our modern Russian all over. He can\'t bring himself to swindle without a moral sanction. He is so in love with truth-.","In scattering the seed, scattering your \'charity,\' your kind deeds, you are giving away, in one form or antoher, part of your personality, and taking into yourself part of another; you are in mutual communion with one another, a little more attention and you will be rewarded with the knowledge of the most unexpected discoveries. You will come at last to look upon your work as a science; it will lay hold of all your life, and may fill up your whole life. On the other hand, all your thoughts, all the seeds scattered by you, perhaps forgotten by you, will grow up and take form. He who has received them from you will hand them on to another. And how can you tell what part you may have in the future determination of the destinies of humanity?","Because you\'re lukewarm, not hot or cold, you\'ll spill out of my mouth like vomit.","It\'s because I chatter that I do nothing.

And through the development of this many-sidedness man may come to finding enjoyment in bloodshed. In fact, this has already happened to him. Have you noticed that it is the most civilised gentlemen who have been the subtlest slaughterers, to whom the Attilas and Stenka Razins could not hold a candle, and if they are not so conspicuous as the Attilas and Stenka Razins it is simply because they are so often met with, are so ordinary and have become so familiar to us. In any case civilisation has made mankind if not more bloodthirsty, at least more vilely, more loathsomely bloodthirsty. In old days he saw justice in bloodshed and with his conscience at peace exterminated those he thought proper. Now we do think bloodshed abominable and yet we engage in this abomination, and with more energy than ever. Which is worse? Decide that for yourselves. They say that Cleopatra (excuse an instance from Roman history) was fond of sticking gold pins into her slave-girls\' breasts and derived gratification from their screams and writhings. You will say that that was in the comparatively barbarous times; that these are barbarous times too, because also, comparatively speaking, pins are stuck in even now; that though man has now learned to see more clearly than in barbarous ages, he is still far from having learnt to act as reason and science would dictate. But yet you are fully convinced that he will be sure to learn when he gets rid of certain old bad habits, and when common sense and science have completely re-educated human nature and turned it in a normal direction. You are confident that then man will cease from INTENTIONAL error and will, so to say, be compelled not to want to set his will against his normal interests. That is not all; then, you say, science itself will teach man (though to my mind it\'s a superfluous luxury) that he never has really had any caprice or will of his own, and that he himself is something of the nature of a piano-key or the stop of an organ, and that there are, besides, things called the laws of nature; so that everything he does is not done by his willing it, but is done of itself, by the laws of nature. Consequently we have only to discover these laws of nature, and man will no longer have to answer for his actions and life will become exceedingly easy for him. All human actions will then, of course, be tabulated according to these laws, mathematically, like tables of logarithms up to 108,000, and entered in an index; or, better still, there would be published certain edifying works of the nature of encyclopaedic lexicons, in which everything will be so clearly calculated and explained that there will be no more incidents or adventures in the world.","Wer sich selbst bel\xfcgt und seine eigenen L\xfcgen anh\xf6rt, kommt schlie\xdflich soweit, dass er keine Wahrheit mehr, weder in sich noch au\xdfer sich, zu erkennen vermag [...]","Beauty will save the world\\" - The Idiot","But I\'ll add, that there is something at the bottom of every new human thought, every thought of genius, or even every earnest thought that springs up in any brain, which can never be communicated to others, even if one were to write volumes about it and were explaining one\'s idea for thirty-five years; there\'s something left which cannot be induced to emerge from your brain, and remains with you forever; and with it you will die, without communicating to anyone perhaps the most important of your ideas","Nothing is more seductive for man than his freedom of conscience, but nothing is a greater cause of suffering.","Have you seen a leaf, a leaf from a tree?\\"\\"I have. \\"\\"I saw one recently, a yellow one, with some green,decayed on the edges.

But none the less, I am certain that she would keep it all her life as a precious treasure, as her pride and justification, and now at such a minute she had thought of that letter and brought it with naive pride to raise herself in my eyes that I might see, that I, too, might think well of her.","I was especially happy when, going to bed and covering myself with a blanket, I began, alone now, in the most complete solitude, with no people moving around and not a single sound from them, to re-create life in a different key.","All we Karamazovs are such insects.

Beauty is a terrible and awful thing! It is terrible because it has not been fathomed and never can be fathomed, for God sets before us nothing but riddles.

Too many riddles weigh men down on earth. We must solve as we can, and try to keep a dry skin in the water. Beauty!

He had come gradually to many different and curious conclusions, and in his opinion the chief reason lay not so much in the material impossibility of concealing the crime, as in the criminal himself. Almost every criminal is subject to a failure of will and reasoning power by a childish and phenomenal heedlessness, at the very instant when prudence and caution are most essential. It was his conviction that this eclipse of reason and failure of will power attacked a man like a disease, developed gradually and reached its highest point just before the perpetration of the crime, continued with equal violence at the moment of the crime and for longer or shorter time after, according to the individual case, and then passed off like any other disease. The question whether the disease gives rise to the crime, or whether the crime from its own peculiar nature is always accompanied by something of the nature of disease, he did not yet feel able to decide.","Though these young men unhappily fail tounderstand that the sacrifice of life is, in many cases, the easiest ofall sacrifices, and that to sacrifice, for instance, five or six years oftheir seething youth to hard and tedious study, if only to multiplytenfold their powers of serving the truth and the cause they have setbefore them as their goal--such a sacrifice is utterly beyond the strengthof many of them.","\u0647\u0644 \u0641\u0643\u0631\u062a\u0645 -\u0623\u064a\u0647\u0627 \u0627\u0644\u0633\u0627\u062f\u0629- \u0641\u064a \u0627\u0644\u0639\u062f\u062f \u0627\u0644\u0645\u0631\u0648\u0639 \u0645\u0646 \u0627\u0644\u0634\u0628\u0627\u0628 \u0627\u0644\u0630\u064a\u0646 \u064a\u0646\u062a\u062d\u0631\u0648\u0646 \u0641\u064a \u0628\u0644\u0627\u062f\u0646\u0627\u061f \u0625\u0646\u0647\u0645 \u064a\u0642\u062a\u0644\u0648\u0646 \u0623\u0646\u0641\u0633\u0647\u0645 \u0628\u0644\u0627 \u0643\u0644\u0627\u0645\u060c \u062f\u0648\u0646 \u064a\u062a\u0633\u0627\u0626\u0644\u0648\u0627 -\u0643\u0645\u0627 \u0641\u0639\u0644 \u0647\u0627\u0645\u0644\u062a- \u0639\u0645\u0627 \u0633\u064a\u0635\u064a\u0631\u0648\u0646 \u0625\u0644\u064a\u0647 \u0628\u0639\u062f \u0627\u0644\u0645\u0648\u062a. \u0644\u0643\u0623\u0646 \u0645\u0634\u0643\u0644\u0629 \u0627\u0644\u0646\u0641\u0633 \u0627\u0644\u0625\u0646\u0633\u0627\u0646\u064a\u0629 \u0648\u0627\u0644\u0645\u0635\u064a\u0631 \u0627\u0644\u0630\u064a \u064a\u0646\u062a\u0638\u0631\u0646\u0627 \u0641\u064a \u0627\u0644\u062d\u064a\u0627\u0629 \u0627\u0644\u0622\u062e\u0631\u0629 \u0623\u0635\u0628\u062d\u062a \u063a\u0631\u064a\u0628\u0629 \u0639\u0646 \u0639\u0642\u0648\u0644\u0647\u0645\u060c \u0642\u062f \u0646\u0633\u0648\u0627 \u0648\u062f\u0641\u0646\u0648\u0627 \u0647\u0630\u0627 \u0627\u0644\u0646\u0648\u0639 \u0645\u0646 \u0627\u0644\u0627\u0647\u062a\u0645\u0627\u0645\u0627\u062a \u0648\u0627\u0644\u062a\u0633\u0627\u0624\u0644\u0627\u062a \u0645\u0646\u0630 \u0632\u0645\u0646 \u0637\u0648\u064a\u0644.","Oh, I have always been proud, I always wanted all or nothing!

Take these torments upon yourself and suffer them, and your heart will be eased, and you will understand that you, too, are guilty, for you might have shone to the wicked, even like the only sinless One, but you did not. If you had shone, your light would have lighted the way for others, and the one who did wickedness would perhaps not have done so in your light. And even if you do shine, but see that people are not saved even with your light, remain steadfast, and do not doubt the power of the heavenly light; believe that if they are not saved now, they will be saved later. And if they are not saved, their sons will be saved, for your light will not die, even when you are dead. The righteous man departs, but his light remains. People are always saved after the death of him who saved them. The generation of men does not welcome its prophets and kills them, but men love their martyrs and venerate those they have tortured to death. Your work is for the whole, your deed is for the future. Never seek a reward, for great is your reward on earth without that: your spiritual joy, which only the righteous obtain. Nor should you fear the noble and powerful, but be wise and ever gracious. Know measure, know the time, learn these things. When you are alone, pray. Love to throw yourself down on the earth and kiss it. Kiss the earth and love it, tirelessly, insatiable, love all men, love all things, seek this rapture and ecstasy. Water the earth with the tears of your joy, and love those tears. Do not be ashamed of this ecstasy, treasure it, for it is a gift from God, a great gift, and it is not given to many, but to those who are chosen.","At that time I was only twenty-four years old. My life then was already gloomy, disorderly, and solitary to the point of savagery.","we are all divorced from life, we are all cripples, every one of us, more or less. We are so divorced from it that we feel at once a sort of loathing for real life, and so cannot bear to be reminded of it. Why, we have come almost to looking upon real life as an effort, almost as hard work, and we are all privately agreed that it is better in books","Reality alone justifies everything.","Why, the isolation that prevails everywhere, above all in our age\u2014it has not fully developed, it has not reached its limit yet. For every one strives to keep his individuality as apart as possible, wishes to secure the greatest possible fullness of life for himself; but meantime all his efforts result not in attaining fullness of life but self-destruction, for instead of self-realization he ends by arriving at complete solitude. All mankind in our age have split up into units, they all keep apart, each in his own groove; each one holds aloof, hides himself and hides what he has, from the rest, and he ends by being repelled by others and repelling them. He heaps up riches by himself and thinks, \u2018How strong I am now and how secure,\u2019 and in his madness he does not understand that the more he heaps up, the more he sinks into self-destructive impotence. For he is accustomed to rely upon himself alone and to cut himself off from the whole; he has trained himself not to believe in the help of others, in men and in humanity, and only trembles for fear he should lose his money and the privileges that he has won for himself. Everywhere in these days men have, in their mockery, ceased to understand that the true security is to be found in social solidarity rather than in isolated individual effort. But this terrible individualism must inevitably have an end, and all will suddenly understand how unnaturally they are separated from one another. It will be the spirit of the time, and people will marvel that they have sat so long in darkness without seeing the light.","There is a crack in my soul, and I can hear it trembling, quivering, stirring deep inside me.","The impudence of Ignorance","How anxiously I yearned for those I had forsake","Science and reason have, from the beginning of time, played a secondary and subordinate part in the life of nations; so it will be till the end of time. Nations are built up and moved by another force which sways and dominates them, the origin of which is unknown and inexplicable: that force is the force of an insatiable desire to go on to the end, though at the same time it denies that end. It is the force of the persistent assertion of one\'s own existence, and a denial of death. It\'s the spirit of life, as the Scriptures call it, \'the river of living water,\' the drying up of which is threatened in the Apocalypse. It\'s the \xe6sthetic principle, as the philosophers call it, the ethical principle with which they identify it, \'the seeking for God,\' as I call it more simply. The object of every national movement, in every people and at every period of its existence is only the seeking for its god, who must be its own god, and the faith in Him as the only true one. God is the synthetic personality of the whole people, taken from its beginning to its end. It has never happened that all, or even many, peoples have had one common god, but each has always had its own. It\'s a sign of the decay of nations when they begin to have gods in common. When gods begin to be common to several nations the gods are dying and the faith in them, together with the nations themselves. The stronger a people the more individual their God. There never has been a nation without a religion, that is, without an idea of good and evil. Every people has its own conception of good and evil, and its own good and evil. When the same conceptions of good and evil become prevalent in several nations, then these nations are dying, and then the very distinction between good and evil is beginning to disappear. Reason has never had the power to define good and evil, or even to distinguish between good and evil, even approximately; on the contrary, it has always mixed them up in a disgraceful and pitiful way; science has even given the solution by the fist. This is particularly characteristic of the half-truths of science, the most terrible scourge of humanity, unknown till this century, and worse than plague, famine, or war. A half-truth is a despot... such as has never been in the world before. A despot that has its priests and its slaves, a despot to whom all do homage with love and superstition hitherto inconceivable, before which science itself trembles and cringes in a shameful way.","I saw the truth, I saw and I know that people can be beautiful and happy without losing the ability to live on earth. I will not and cannot believe that evil is the normal condition of people.","And I seem to have such strength in me now, that I think I could stand anything, any suffering, only to be able to say and to repeat to myself every moment, \\" I exist\\". In thousands of agonies - I exist. I\'m tormented on the rack - but I exist! Though I sit alone on a pillar - I exist!! I see the sun, and if I don\'t see the sun, I know it\'s there. And there\'s a whole life in that, in knowing that the sun is there.","I worked it through with pride,I almost spoke without words, and i\'m masterly at speaking without words.All my life I have spoken without words, and I have passed through whole tragedies on my own account without words","Nou\u0103 ne e penibil p\xeen\u0103 \u015fi s\u0103 fim oameni, oameni cu trup \u015fi s\xeenge adev\u0103rat, propriu, ne e ru\u015fine de asta, socotim acest lucru degradant \u015fi tindem s\u0103 fim habar n-am ce oameni \u2014 \xeendeob\u015fte, ceva ce \xeenc\u0103 nu s-a pomenit.

But he alone can take over the freedom of men who appeases their conscience. With bread you were given an indisputable banner: give man bread and he will bow down to you, for there is nothing more indisputable than bread. But if at the same time someone else takes over his conscience - oh, then he will even throw down your bread and follow him who has seduced his conscience. In this you were right. For the mystery of man\'s being is not only in living, but in what one lives for. Without a firm idea of what he lives for, man will not consent to live and will sooner destroy himself than remain on earth, even if there is bread all around him. That is so, but what came of it? Instead of taking over men\'s freedom, you increased it still more for them! Did you forget that peace and even death are dearer to man than free choice in the knowledge of good and evil? There is nothing more seductive for man than the freedom of his conscience, but there is nothing more tormenting either. And so, instead of a firm foundation for appeasing human conscience once and for all, you chose everything that was unusual, enigmatic, and indefinite, you chose everything that was beyond men\'s strength, and thereby acted as if you did not love them at all - and who did this? He who came to give his life for them! Instead of taking over men\'s freedom, you increased it and forever burdened the kingdom of the human soul with its torments. You desired the free love of man, that he should follow you freely. seduced and captivated by you. Instead of the firm ancient law, men had henceforth to decide for himself, with a free heart, what is good and what is evil, having only your image before him as a guide - but did it not occur to you that he would eventually reject and dispute even your image and your truth if he was oppressed by so terrible a burden as freedom of choice? They will finally cry out that the truth is not in you, for it was impossible to leave them in greater confusion and torment than you did, abandoning them to so many cares and insoluble problems. Thus you yourself laid the foundation for the destruction of your own kingdom, and do not blame anyone else for it.","I bless the rising sun each day, and, as before, my heart sings to meet it, but now I love even more its setting, its long slanting rays & the soft tender gentle memories that come with them...\u2019-Father Zossima","Do you understand, sir, do you understand what it means when you have absolutely nowhere to turn?","And it all flew away like a dream--even my passion, and yet it really was strong and true, but...where has it gone now?

There was, they say, a certain thinker and philospher here on your earth, who \'rejected all--laws, conscience faith, and, above all, the future life. He died and thought he\'d go straight into darkness and death, but no--there was the future life before him. He was amazed and indignant. \'This,\' he said, \'goes against my convictions.\' So for that he was sentenced...I mean, you see, I beg your pardon, I\'m repeating what I heard, it\'s just a legend...you see, he was sentenced to walk in darkness a quadrillion kilometers (we also use kilometers now), and once he finished that quadrillion, the doors of paradise would be open to him and he would be forgiven everything...Well, so this man sentenced to the quadrillion stood a while, looked, and then lay down across the road: \'I dont want to go, I refuse to go on principle!\' Take the soul of an enlightened Russian atheist and mix it with the soul of the prophet Jonah, who sulked in the belly of a whale for three days and three nights--you\'ll get the character of this thinker lying in the road...He lay there for nearly a thousand years, and then got up and started walking.\\"\\"What an ass!\\" Ivan exclaimed, bursting into nervous laughter, still apparently trying hard to figure something out. \\"isn\'t it all the same whether he lies there forever or walks a quadrillion kilometers? It must be about a billion years\' walk!\\"\\"Much more, even. If we had a pencil and paper, we could work it out. But he arrived long ago, and this is where the anecdote begins.\\"\\"Arrived! But where did he get a billion years?\\"\\"You keep thinking about our present earth! But our present earth may have repeated itself a billion times; it died out, lets say, got covered with ice, cracked, fell to pieces, broke down into its original components, again there were the waters above the firmament, then again a comet, again the sun, again the earth from the sun--all this development may already have been repeated an infinite number of times, and always in the same way, to the last detail. A most unspeakable bore...\\"Go on, what happened when he arrived?\\"\\"The moment the doors of paradise were opened and he went in, before he had even been there two seconds--and that by the watch--before he had been there two seconds, he exclaimed that for those two seconds it would be worth walking not just a quadrillion kilometers, but a quadrillion quadrillion, even raised to the quadrillionth power! In short, he sang \'Hosannah\' and oversweetened it so much that some persons there, of a nobler cast of mind, did not even want to shake hands with him at first: he jumped over to the conservatives a bit too precipitously. The Russian character. I repeat: it\'s a legend.","Money is the honey of humanity.","Thus a man will sometimes suffer half an hour of mortal fear with a robber, but once the knife is finally at his throat, even fear vanishes.","I am trying to explain as quickly as possible my essential nature, that is, what manner of man I am, what I believe in, and for what I hope, that\'s it, isn\'t it? And therefore I tell you that I accept God honestly and simply. But you must note this: If God exists and if He really did create the world, then, as we all know, He created it according to the geometry of only three dimensions in space. Yet there have been some very distinguished ones, who doubt whether the whole universe, or to speak more generally the whole of being, was only created in Euclid\'s geometry; they even dare to dream that two parallel lines, which according to Euclid can never meet on earth, may meet somewhere in infinity. I have come to the conclusion that, since I can\'t understand even that, I can\'t expect to understand about God. I acknowledge humbly that I have no faculty for settling such questions, I have a Euclidian earthly mind, and how could I solve problems that are not of this world? And I advise you never to think about it either, my dear Alyosha, especially about God, whether He exists or not. All such questions are utterly inappropriate for a mind created with a conception of only three dimensions. And so I accept God and am glad to, and what\'s more I accept His wisdom, His purpose - which are utterly beyond our ken; I believe in the underlying order and the meaning of life; I believe in the eternal harmony in which they say we shall one day be blended. I believe in the Word to Which the universe is striving, and Which Itself was \\"with God\\", and Which Itself is God and so on, and so on, to infinity.","\u0644\u0645\u0627\u0630\u0627 \u062a\u0628\u062f\u0648 \u0644\u0647\u0645 \u0641\u0639\u0644\u062a\u064a \u0634\u0627\u0630\u0629 \u0625\u0644\u0649 \u0647\u0630\u0627 \u0627\u0644\u062d\u062f\u061f \u0623\u0644\u0627 \u0627\u0646\u0647\u0627 \u062c\u0631\u064a\u0645\u0629\u061f \u0645\u0627\u0630\u0627 \u062a\u0639\u0646\u064a \u0643\u0644\u0645\u0629 \u062c\u0631\u064a\u0645\u0629\u061f \u0625\u0646 \u0636\u0645\u064a\u0631\u064a \u0645\u0631\u062a\u0627\u062d. \u0635\u062d\u064a\u062d \u0623\u0646 \u062c\u0631\u064a\u0645\u0629 \u0642\u062f \u0648\u0642\u0639\u062a. \u0635\u062d\u064a\u062d \u0623\u0646 \u0646\u0635 \u0627\u0644\u0642\u0627\u0646\u0648\u0646 \u0642\u062f \u0627\u062e\u062a\u0631\u0642 \u0648\u0623\u0646 \u062f\u0645\u0627 \u0642\u062f \u0633\u0641\u0643. \u0641\u0625\u0630\u0627 \u0643\u0627\u0646 \u0627\u0644\u0623\u0645\u0631 \u0623\u0645\u0631 \u062a\u0642\u064a\u062f \u0628\u0646\u0635 \u0627\u0644\u0642\u0627\u0646\u0648\u0646 \u0641\u0623\u0642\u0637\u0639\u0648\u0627 \u0631\u0623\u0633\u064a \u0648\u0644\u0646\u0633\u0643\u062a ! \u0648\u0644\u0643\u0646 \u064a\u062c\u0628 \u0623\u0646 \u0646\u0630\u0643\u0631 \u0641\u064a \u0647\u0630\u0647 \u0627\u0644\u062d\u0627\u0644\u0629 \u0623\u0646 \u0643\u062b\u064a\u0631\u0627 \u0645\u0646 \u0627\u0644\u0639\u0638\u0645\u0627\u0621 \u0627\u0644\u0630\u064a\u0646 \u0627\u062d\u0633\u0646\u0648\u0627 \u0625\u0644\u0649 \u0627\u0644\u0625\u0646\u0633\u0627\u0646\u064a\u0629 \u0648\u0644\u0645 \u064a\u0643\u0648\u0646\u0648\u0627 \u0642\u062f \u0648\u0631\u062b\u0648\u0627 \u0627\u0644\u0633\u0644\u0637\u0629 \u0648\u0631\u0627\u062b\u0629 \u0648\u0625\u0646\u0645\u0627 \u0627\u0633\u062a\u0648\u0644\u0648\u0627 \u0639\u0644\u064a\u0647\u0627 \u0625\u0633\u062a\u064a\u0644\u0627\u0621. \u0643\u0627\u0646 \u064a\u0646\u0628\u063a\u064a \u0623\u0646 \u062a\u0642\u0637\u0639 \u0631\u0621\u0648\u0633\u0647\u0645 \u0645\u0646\u0630 \u062e\u0637\u0648\u0627 \u062e\u0637\u0648\u0627\u062a\u0647\u0645 \u0627\u0644\u0623\u0648\u0644\u0649. \u0623\u0646 \u0627\u0644\u0641\u0631\u0642 \u0627\u0644\u0648\u062d\u064a\u062f \u0628\u064a\u0646 \u0647\u0624\u0644\u0627\u0621 \u0648\u0628\u064a\u0646\u064a \u0647\u0648 \u0625\u0646\u0647\u0645 \u0642\u062f \u0627\u062d\u062a\u0645\u0644\u0648\u0627 \u062b\u0642\u0644 \u0623\u0641\u0639\u0627\u0644\u0647\u0645 \u0641\u0643\u0627\u0646 \u0630\u0644\u0643 \u0645\u0628\u0631\u0631\u0627 \u0644\u0647\u0645\u060c \u0627\u0645\u0627 \u0627\u0646\u0627 \u0641\u0644\u0645 \u0623\u0642\u062f\u0631 \u0639\u0644\u0649 \u0627\u0644\u0635\u0645\u0648\u062f \u0625\u0630\u0627 \u0643\u0627\u0646 \u0644\u0627 \u064a\u062d\u0642 \u0644\u064a \u0627\u0646 \u0627\u062c\u064a\u0632 \u0644\u0646\u0641\u0633\u064a \u0627\u0644\u0642\u064a\u0627\u0645 \u0628\u062a\u0644\u0643 \u0627\u0644\u0645\u062d\u0627\u0648\u0644\u0629.","And how can one love two at once?

That makes it holier and better. They respect one another more, and much is built on respect. And if once there has been love, if they have been married for love, why should love pass away? Surely one can keep it! It is rare that one cannot keep it. And if the husband is kind and straightforward, why should not love last? The first phase of married love will pass, it is true, but then there will come a love that is better still. Then there will be the union of souls, they will have everything in common, there will be no secrets between them. And once they have children, the most difficult times will seem to them happy, so long as there is love and courage. Even toil will be a joy, you may deny yourself bread for your children and even that will be a joy, They will love you for it afterwards; so you are laying by for your future.As the children grow up you feel that you are an example, a support for them; that even after you die your children will always keep your thoughts and feelings, because they have received them from you, they will take on your semblance and likeness. So you see this is a great duty.","To kill for murder is an immeasurably greater evil than the actual crime itself. Judicial murder is immeasurably more horrible than one committed by a robber. Someone killed by a robber, knifed at night in forest or somewhere, certainly keeps hoping for a rescue right up to the last second. There have been instances of people whose throats have been cut still hoping for rescue right up to the last second. There have been instances of people whose throats have been cut still hoping, or running away, or pleading for their lives. But all this final hope, which makes dying ten times easier is taken away by that certain; the sentence is pronounced and the whole agony resides in the fact that there\u2019s no escape. There is no greater torture in the world than that. Fetch a soldier and stand him right in front of a cannon during a battle and fire at him, he\u2019ll go on hoping; but read out a certain death sentence to that same soldier and he\u2019ll go off his head or bust into tears. Who can say that human nature can bear such a thing like that without going mad? Why this disgusting pointless, unnecessary mockery?

It\'s not worth the tears of that one tortured child who beat itself on the breast with its little fist and prayed in its stinking outhouse, with its unexpiated tears to \'dear, kind God\'! It\'s not worth it, because those tears are unatoned for. They must be atoned for, or there can be no harmony... I don\'t want harmony. From love for humanity I don\'t want it. I would rather be left with the unavenged suffering. I would rather remain with my unavenged suffering and unsatisfied indignation, even if I were wrong. Besides, too high a price is asked for harmony; it\'s beyond our means to pay so much to enter on it. And so I hasten to give back my entrance ticket, and if I am an honest man I am bound to give it back as soon as possible. And that I am doing. It\'s not God that I don\'t accept, Alyosha, only I most respectfully return him the ticket.","I\'ve been living like this for a long time - about twenty years. I\'m forty now. I used to be in the civil service; I no longer am. I was a wicked official. I was rude, and took pleasure in it. After all, I didn\'t accept bribes, so I had to reward myself at least with that. (A bad witticism, but I won\'t cross it out. I wrote it thinking it would come out very witty; but now, seeing for myself that I simply had a vile wish to swagger - I purposely won\'t cross it out!) When petitioners would come for information to the desk where I sat - I\'d gnash my teeth at them, and felt an inexhaustible delight when I managed to upset someone. I almost always managed. They were timid people for the most part: petitioners, you know. But among the fops there was one officer I especially could not stand. He simply refused to submit and kept rattling his sabre disgustingly. I was at war with him over that sabre for a year and a half. In the end, I prevailed. He stopped rattling. However, that was still in my youth. But do you know, gentlemen, what was the main point about my wickedness? The whole thing precisely was, the greatest nastiness precisely lay in my being shamefully conscious every moment, even in moments of the greatest bile, that I was not only not a wicked but was not even an embittered man, that I was simply frightening sparrows in vain, and pleasing myself with it. I\u2019m foaming at the mouth, but bring me some little doll, give me some tea with a bit of suger, and maybe I\u2019ll calm down. I\u2019ll even wax tenderhearted, though afterwards I\u2019ll certainly gnash my teeth at myself and suffer from insomnia for a few months out of shame. Such is my custom.And I lied about myself just now when I said I was a wicked official. I lied out of wickedness. I was simply playing around both with the petitioners and with the officer, but as a matter of fact I was never able to become wicked.","How can you tell a man there\u2019s nothing to do? I can\u2019t imagine a situation in which there could ever be nothing to do! Do it for mankind and don\u2019t worry about the rest. There\u2019s so much to do that a lifetime won\u2019t be enough, if you look around attentively.","I don\u2019t understand how, up to now, an atheist could know there is no God and not kill himself at once. To recognize that there is no God, and not to recognize at the same time that you have become God, is an absurdity, otherwise you must necessarily kill yourself. Once you recognize it, you are king, and you will not kill yourself but will live in the chiefest glory. But one, the one who is first, must necessarily kill himself, otherwise who will begin and prove it? It is I who will necessarily kill myself in order to begin and prove it. I am still God against my will, and I am unhappy, because it is my duty to proclaim self-will. Everyone is unhappy, because everyone is afraid to proclaim self-will. That is why man has been so unhappy and poor up to now, because he was afraid to proclaim the chief point of self-will and was self-willed only on the margins, like a schoolboy. I am terribly unhappy, because I am terribly afraid. Fear is man\u2019s curse \u2026 But I will proclaim self-will, it is my duty to believe that I do not believe. I will begin, and end, and open the door. And save. Only this one thing will save all men and in the next generation transform them physically; for in the present physical aspect, so far as I have thought, it is in no way possible for man to be without the former God. For three years I have been searching for the attribute of my divinity, and I have found it: the attribute of my divinity is\u2014Self-will! That is all, by which I can show in the main point my insubordination and my new fearsome freedom. For it is very fearsome. I kill myself to show my insubordination and my new fearsome freedom.Dostoevsky, Fyodor (2010-05-06). Demons (Vintage Classics) (p. 619). Random House, Inc..

For the most part, we Russians are so richly endowed that it takes genius for us to find a decent form. Well, but most often there is no genius, because generally it rarely occurs. It\'s only the French, and perhaps some few other Europeans, who have so well-defined a form that one can look extremely dignified and yet be a most undignified man. That\'s why form means so much to them. A Frenchman can suffer an insult, a real, heartfelt insult, and not wince, but a flick on the nose he won\'t suffer for anything, because it\'s a violation of the accepted and time-honored form of decency.

No, take the deed of heroism that is labourious, obscure, without noise or flourish, slandered, in which there is a great deal of sacrifice and not one grain of glory - in which you, a splendid man, are made to look like a scoundrel before every one, though you might be the most honest man in the world - you try that sort of heroism and you\'ll soon give it up!

Only you must know how to find it - that\'s the point! That requires talent! For me ugly women do not exist: the very fact that she\'s a woman is half the attraction for me- but how could you understand that? Even in old maids you sometimes find something so attractive that you can\'t help marvelling at the damn fools who\'ve let them grow old without noticing it! The first thing to do with barefooted girls and ugly women is to take them by surprise - that\'s how one should deal with them. You didn\'t know that, did you? They must be surprised till they\'re enraptured, till they\'re transfixed, till they\'re ashamed that such a gentleman should have fallen in love with such a swarthy creature. What\'s so wonderful is that so long as there are peasants and gentlemen in the world - and there always will be - there will also be such lovely little scullery maids and their masters - that\'s all one needs for one\'s happiness.","You will have many enemies, but even your foes will love you. Life will bring you many misfortunes, but you will find your happiness in them, and will bless life and will make others bless it--which is what matters most.","It is almost better to tell your own lies than somebody else\'s truth; in the first case you are a man, in the second you are no better than a parrot!","Nothing in the world is harder than speaking the truth and nothing easier than flattery.If there\u2019s the hundredth part of a false note in speaking the truth, it leads to a discord, and that leads to trouble.But if all, to the last note, is false in flattery, it is just as agreeable, and is heard not without satisfaction.

No, they cannot, and we will not impose on them an impossible restriction.

The conventional answer to this question is: \'He begot you, and you are his flesh and blood, and therefore you are bound to love him.\' The youth involuntarily reflects: \'But did he love me when he begot me?\' he asks, wondering more and more. \'Was it for my sake he begot me? He did not know me, not even my sex, at that moment, at the moment of passion, perhaps, inflamed by wine, and he has only transmitted to me a propensity to drunkenness- that\'s all he\'s done for me....

That is why philosophers say it is impossible on earth to conceive the essence of things. God took seeds from other worlds and sowed them on this earth, and raised up his garden; and everything that could sprout sprouted, but it lives and grows only through its sense of being in touch with other mysterious worlds; if this sense is weakened or destroyed in you, that which has grown up in you dies.

Oh, there is much humility and humiliation in it, but all of it comes from pride.","La cuesti\xf3n principal que se tratar\xe1 en todas las partes de este libro es la misma que me ha hecho sufrir consciente o inconscientemente durante toda mi vida: la existencia de Dios","\u0644\u0627 \u064a\u0643\u0641\u064a \u0623\u0646 \u064a\u0643\u0648\u0646 \u0627\u0644\u0645\u0631\u0621 \u0630\u0643\u064a\u064b\u0627 \u062d\u062a\u0649 \u064a\u062a\u0635\u0631\u0641 \u0628\u0630\u0643\u0627\u0621.","I\'ve already warned you that the simplest ideas are the hardest to understand; I\'ll now add that they are also the hardest to explain.","It ended by my almost believing (perhaps actually believing) that this was perhaps my normal condition. But at first, in the beginning, what agonies I endured in that struggle! I did not believe it was the same with other people, and all my life I hid this fact about myself as a secret. I was ashamed (even now, perhaps, I am ashamed): I got to the point of feeling a sort of secret abnormal, despicable enjoyment in returning home to my corner on some disgusting Petersburg night, acutely conscious that that day I had committed a loathsome action again, that what was done could never be undone, and secretly, inwardly gnawing, gnawing at myself for it, tearing and consuming myself till at last the bitterness turned into a sort of shameful accursed sweetness, and at last\u2014into positive real enjoyment! Yes, into enjoyment, into enjoyment! I insist upon that. I have spoken of this because I keep wanting to know for a fact whether other people feel such enjoyment? I will explain; the enjoyment was just from the too intense consciousness of one\u2019s own degradation; it was from feeling oneself that one had reached the last barrier, that it was horrible, but that it could not be otherwise; that there was no escape for you; that you never could become a different man; that even if time and faith were still left you to change into something different you would most likely not wish to change; or if you did wish to, even then you would do nothing; because perhaps in reality there was nothing for you to change into.And the worst of it was, and the root of it all, that it was all in accord with the normal fundamental laws of over-acute consciousness, and with the inertia that was the direct result of those laws, and that consequently one was not only unable to change but could do absolutely nothing. Thus it would follow, as the result of acute consciousness, that one is not to blame in being a scoundrel; as though that were any consolation to the scoundrel once he has come to realise that he actually is a scoundrel.","\u0625\u0646 \u0627\u0644\u062e\u0637\u0623 \u0647\u0648 \u0627\u0644\u0645\u064a\u0632\u0629 \u0627\u0644\u0648\u062d\u064a\u062f\u0629 \u0627\u0644\u062a\u064a \u064a\u0645\u062a\u0627\u0632 \u0628\u0647\u0627 \u0627\u0644\u0643\u0627\u0626\u0646 \u0627\u0644\u0625\u0646\u0633\u0627\u0646\u064a \u0639\u0644\u0649 \u0633\u0627\u0626\u0631 \u0627\u0644\u0643\u0627\u0626\u0646\u0627\u062a \u0627\u0644\u062d\u064a\u0629. \u0645\u0646 \u064a\u062e\u0637\u0626 \u064a\u0635\u0644 \u0625\u0644\u0649 \u0627\u0644\u062d\u0642\u064a\u0642\u0629. \u0623\u0646\u0627 \u0625\u0646\u0633\u0627\u0646 \u0644\u0623\u0646\u0646\u064a \u0623\u062e\u0637\u0626. \u0645\u0627 \u0648\u0635\u0644 \u0627\u0645\u0631\u0626 \u0625\u0644\u0649 \u062d\u0642\u064a\u0642\u0629 \u0648\u0627\u062d\u062f\u0629 \u0625\u0644\u0627 \u0628\u0639\u062f \u0623\u0646 \u0623\u062e\u0637\u0623 \u0623\u0631\u0628\u0639 \u0639\u0634\u0631\u0629 \u0645\u0631\u0629 \u0648\u0631\u0628\u0645\u0627 \u0645\u0626\u0629 \u0648\u0623\u0631\u0628\u0639 \u0639\u0634\u0631\u0629 \u0645\u0631\u0629 !

Grown-up people do not know that a child can give exceedingly good advice even in the most difficult case.","\u0625\u0646 \u0641\u064a \u0645\u0642\u062f\u0648\u0631 \u0627\u0644\u0625\u0646\u0633\u0627\u0646 \u0623\u0646 \u064a\u062e\u0628\u0631 \u0627\u0644\u0637\u0641\u0644 \u0628\u0643\u0644 \u0634\u064a\u0621. \u0643\u0644 \u0634\u064a\u0621. \u0648\u0643\u062b\u064a\u0631\u0627\u064b \u0645\u0627 \u0623\u0630\u0647\u0644\u062a\u0646\u064a \u062d\u0642\u064a\u0642\u0629 \u0623\u0646 \u0627\u0644\u0622\u0628\u0627\u0621 \u0644\u0627 \u064a\u0639\u0631\u0641\u0648\u0646 \u0639\u0646 \u0623\u0628\u0646\u0627\u0626\u0647\u0645 \u0625\u0644\u0627 \u0627\u0644\u0642\u0644\u064a\u0644. \u0644\u064a\u0633 \u0639\u0644\u064a\u0647\u0645 \u0623\u0646 \u064a\u062e\u0641\u0648\u0627 \u0639\u0646\u0647\u0645 \u0627\u0644\u0643\u062b\u064a\u0631 \u0644\u0623\u0646 \u0627\u0644\u0623\u0637\u0641\u0627\u0644 \u062d\u062a\u0649 \u0627\u0644\u0635\u063a\u0627\u0631 \u0645\u0646\u0647\u0645 \u064a\u062f\u0631\u0643\u0648\u0646 \u062a\u0645\u0627\u0645\u0627\u064b \u0623\u0646 \u0627\u0644\u0622\u0628\u0627\u0621 \u064a\u062e\u0641\u0648\u0646 \u0639\u0646\u0647\u0645 \u0623\u0634\u064a\u0627\u0621 \u0643\u062b\u064a\u0631\u0629 \u0644\u0623\u0646\u0647\u0645 \u064a\u0631\u0648\u0646\u0647\u0645 \u0623\u0635\u063a\u0631 \u0645\u0646 \u0623\u0646 \u064a\u0641\u0647\u0645\u0648\u0647\u0627! \u0625\u0646 \u0641\u064a \u0625\u0645\u0643\u0627\u0646 \u0627\u0644\u0623\u0637\u0641\u0627\u0644 \u0623\u0646 \u064a\u0642\u062f\u0645\u0648\u0627 \u0627\u0644\u0646\u0635\u064a\u062d\u0629 \u0641\u064a \u0623\u0634\u062f \u0627\u0644\u0623\u0645\u0648\u0631 \u0623\u0647\u0645\u064a\u0629. \u0641\u0643\u064a\u0641 \u064a\u0645\u0643\u0646 \u0644\u0644\u0645\u0631\u0621 \u0623\u0646 \u064a\u062e\u062f\u0639 \u0647\u0630\u0647 \u0627\u0644\u0637\u064a\u0648\u0631 \u0627\u0644\u0635\u063a\u064a\u0631\u0629 \u0627\u0644\u0639\u0632\u064a\u0632\u0629 \u0639\u0646\u062f\u0645\u0627 \u064a\u062a\u0637\u0644\u0639\u0648\u0646 \u0625\u0644\u064a\u0647 \u0641\u064a \u062b\u0642\u0629 \u0648\u0644\u0637\u0641\u061f \u0625\u0646\u0646\u064a \u0623\u0633\u0645\u064a\u0647\u0645 \u0637\u064a\u0648\u0631\u0627\u064b \u0644\u0623\u0646\u0647 \u0644\u0627 \u064a\u0648\u062c\u062f \u0641\u064a \u0627\u0644\u062f\u0646\u064a\u0627 \u0623\u062c\u0645\u0644 \u0645\u0646 \u0627\u0644\u0637\u064a\u0648\u0631","\u0625\u0646 \u0627\u0644\u0634\u0641\u0642\u0629 \u0641\u064a \u0623\u064a\u0627\u0645\u0646\u0627 \u0647\u0630\u0647 \u064a\u062d\u0638\u0631\u0647\u0627 \u0627\u0644\u0639\u0644\u0645","As always, I do not blame anyone. I\'ve tried great debauchery and exhausted my strength in it; but I don\'t like debauchery and I did not want it. You\'ve been observing me lately. Do you know that I even looked at these negators of ours with spite, envying them their hopes? But your fears were empty: I could not be their comrade, because I shared nothing. Nor could I do it out of ridicule, for spite, and not because I was afraid of the ridiculous--I cannot be afraid of the ridiculous--but because, after all, I have the habits of a decent man and felt disgusted. Still, if I had more spite and envy for them, I might even have gone over to them....Your brother told me that he who loses his ties with his earth also loses his gods, that is, all his goals. One can argue endlessly about everything, but what poured out of me was only a negation, with no magnanimity and no force. Or not even negation. Everything is always shallow and listless. Magnanimous Kirillov could not endure his idea and--shot himself; but I do see that he was magnanimous because he was not in his right mind. I can never lose my mind, nor can I ever believe an idea to the same degree as he did. I cannot even entertain an idea to the same degree. I could never, never shoot myself!I know I ought to kill myself, to sweep myself off the earth like a vile insect; but I\'m afraid of suicide, because I\'m afraid of showing magnanimity. I know it will only be one more deceit--the last deceit in an endless series of deceits. What\'s the use of deceiving oneself just so as to play at magnanimity? There never can be indignation or shame in me; and so no despair either.","Nonetheless, a question remains before us all the same: what is a novelist to do with ordinary, completely \\"usual\\" people, and how can he present them to the reader so as to make them at least somewhat interesting? To bypass them altogether in a story is quite impossible, because ordinary people are constantly and for the most part the necessary links in the chain of everyday events; in bypassing them we would thus violate plausibility. To fill novels with nothing but types or even simply, for the sake of interest, with strange and nonexistent people, would be implausible--and perhaps uninteresting as well.","Raskolnikov was not used to crowds, and, as we said before, he avoided society of every sort, more especially of late. But now all at once he felt a desire to be with other people. Something new seemed to be taking place within him, and with it he felt a sort of thirst for company. He was so weary after a whole month of concentrated wretchedness and gloomy excitement that he longed to rest, if only for a moment, in some other world, whatever it might be; and, in spite of the filthiness of the surroundings, he was glad now to stay in the tavern.","\u041e, \u0447\u0442\u043e \u0442\u0430\u043a\u043e\u0435 \u0433\u043e\u0440\u0435? \u0417\u043d\u0430\u0435\u0442\u0435, \u044f \u043d\u0435 \u043f\u043e\u043d\u0438\u043c\u0430\u044e, \u043a\u0430\u043a \u043c\u043e\u0436\u043d\u043e \u043f\u0440\u043e\u0445\u043e\u0434\u0438\u0442\u044c \u043c\u0438\u043c\u043e \u0434\u0435\u0440\u0435\u0432\u0430 \u0438 \u043d\u0435 \u0431\u044b\u0442\u044c \u0441\u0447\u0430\u0441\u0442\u043b\u0438\u0432\u044b\u043c, \u0447\u0442\u043e \u0432\u0438\u0434\u0438\u0448\u044c \u0435\u0433\u043e? \u0413\u043e\u0432\u043e\u0440\u0438\u0442\u044c \u0441 \u0447\u0435\u043b\u043e\u0432\u0435\u043a\u043e\u043c \u0438 \u043d\u0435 \u0431\u044b\u0442\u044c \u0441\u0447\u0430\u0441\u0442\u043b\u0438\u0432\u044b\u043c, \u0447\u0442\u043e \u043b\u044e\u0431\u0438\u0448\u044c \u0435\u0433\u043e! \u041e, \u044f \u0442\u043e\u043b\u044c\u043a\u043e \u043d\u0435 \u0443\u043c\u0435\u044e \u0432\u044b\u0441\u043a\u0430\u0437\u0430\u0442\u044c\u2026 \u0430 \u0441\u043a\u043e\u043b\u044c\u043a\u043e \u0432\u0435\u0449\u0435\u0439 \u043d\u0430 \u043a\u0430\u0436\u0434\u043e\u043c \u0448\u0430\u0433\u0443 \u0442\u0430\u043a\u0438\u0445 \u043f\u0440\u0435\u043a\u0440\u0430\u0441\u043d\u044b\u0445, \u043a\u043e\u0442\u043e\u0440\u044b\u0435 \u0434\u0430\u0436\u0435 \u0441\u0430\u043c\u044b\u0439 \u043f\u043e\u0442\u0435\u0440\u044f\u0432\u0448\u0438\u0439\u0441\u044f \u0447\u0435\u043b\u043e\u0432\u0435\u043a \u043d\u0430\u0445\u043e\u0434\u0438\u0442 \u043f\u0440\u0435\u043a\u0440\u0430\u0441\u043d\u044b\u043c\u0438? \u041f\u043e\u0441\u043c\u043e\u0442\u0440\u0438\u0442\u0435 \u043d\u0430 \u0440\u0435\u0431\u0435\u043d\u043a\u0430 \u043f\u043e\u0441\u043c\u043e\u0442\u0440\u0438\u0442\u0435 \u043d\u0430 \u0411\u043e\u0436\u0438\u044e \u0437\u0430\u0440\u044e, \u043f\u043e\u0441\u043c\u043e\u0442\u0440\u0438\u0442\u0435 \u043d\u0430 \u0442\u0440\u0430\u0432\u043a\u0443, \u043a\u0430\u043a \u043e\u043d\u0430 \u0440\u0430\u0441\u0442\u0435\u0442, \u043f\u043e\u0441\u043c\u043e\u0442\u0440\u0438\u0442\u0435 \u0432 \u0433\u043b\u0430\u0437\u0430, \u043a\u043e\u0442\u043e\u0440\u044b\u0435 \u043d\u0430 \u0432\u0430\u0441 \u0441\u043c\u043e\u0442\u0440\u044f\u0442 \u0438 \u0432\u0430\u0441 \u043b\u044e\u0431\u044f\u0442\u2026","It was not you who ate the idea, but the idea that ate you.","Though I have said that I envy the normal man to the point of exasperation, yet I would not care to be in his place as he is now (though I will not stop envying him.

Such sick dreams always remain long in the memory and make a powerful impression on the overwrought and deranged nervous system.","\u0646\u0639\u0645 \u0623\u0646 \u062a\u0645\u0651\u064e\u062d\u064a\u060c \u0623\u0646 \u062a\u0632\u0648\u0644 \u0645\u0646 \u0627\u0644\u062f\u0631\u0628. \u0623\u0646 \u062a\u062e\u0644\u064a \u0627\u0644\u0637\u0631\u064a\u0642 \u0644\u0644\u0625\u0646\u0633\u0627\u0646 \u0627\u0644\u0630\u064a \u062a\u062d\u0628\u0647 \u0648\u0627\u0644\u0625\u0646\u0633\u0627\u0646 \u0627\u0644\u0630\u064a \u062a\u0643\u0631\u0647\u0647\u060c \u0648\u0623\u0646 \u062a\u062d\u0628 \u062d\u062a\u0649 \u0630\u0627\u0643 \u0627\u0644\u0630\u064a \u0643\u0627\u0646 \u0639\u0644\u064a\u0643 \u0623\u0646 \u062a\u0643\u0631\u0647\u0647...\u0623\u0646 \u062a\u0628\u062a\u0639\u062f \u0639\u0646 \u0637\u0631\u064a\u0642\u0647\u0645\u0627 \u0642\u0627\u0626\u0644\u0627\u064b \\" \\"\u0647\u064a\u0627 \u0627\u0630\u0647\u0628\u0627\u060c \u0648\u0644\u064a\u062d\u0631\u0633\u0643\u0645\u0627 \u0627\u0644\u0644\u0647\u060c \u0623\u0645\u0627 \u0623\u0646\u0627 \u0641\u0633\u0648\u0641.....\\"\u062f\u064a\u0645\u062a\u0631\u064a \u0643\u0627\u0631\u0627\u0645\u0627\u0632\u0648\u0641","\u0623\u0646\u0627... \u0631\u062c\u0644 \u0645\u0631\u064a\u0636... \u0623\u0646\u0627 \u0625\u0646\u0633\u0627\u0646 \u062e\u0628\u064a\u062b. \u0644\u0633\u062a \u0623\u0645\u0644\u0643 \u0634\u064a\u0626\u0627 \u0645\u0645\u0627 \u064a\u062c\u0630\u0628 \u0623\u0648 \u064a\u0641\u062a\u0646. \u0623\u062d\u0633\u0628 \u0623\u0646\u0646\u064a \u0623\u0639\u0627\u0646\u064a \u0645\u0631\u0636\u0627 \u0641\u064a \u0627\u0644\u0643\u0628\u062f\u060c \u0639\u0644\u0649 \u0623\u0646\u0646\u064a \u0644\u0627 \u0623\u0641\u0647\u0645 \u0645\u0646 \u0645\u0631\u0636\u064a \u0634\u064a\u0626\u0627 \u0639\u0644\u0649 \u0627\u0644\u0625\u0637\u0644\u0627\u0642 \u0648\u0644\u0627 \u0623\u0639\u0631\u0641 \u0639\u0644\u0649 \u0648\u062c\u0647 \u0627\u0644\u062f\u0642\u0629 \u0623\u064a\u0646 \u0648\u062c\u0639\u064a \u0648\u0623\u0646\u0627 \u0644\u0627 \u0623\u062f\u0627\u0648\u064a \u0646\u0641\u0633\u064a\u060c \u0648\u0644\u0627 \u062f\u0627\u0648\u064a\u062a \u0646\u0641\u0633\u064a \u0641\u064a \u064a\u0648\u0645 \u0645\u0646 \u0627\u0644\u0623\u064a\u0627\u0645\u060c \u0631\u063a\u0645 \u0623\u0646\u0646\u064a \u0623\u062d\u062a\u0631\u0645 \u0627\u0644\u0637\u0628 \u0648\u0627\u0644\u0623\u0637\u0628\u0627\u0621. \u0648\u0623\u0646\u064a \u0645\u0646 \u062c\u0647\u0629 \u0623\u062e\u0631\u0649 \u0623\u0624\u0645\u0646 \u0628\u0627\u0644\u062e\u0631\u0627\u0641\u0627\u062a \u0625\u0644\u0649 \u0623\u0642\u0635\u0649 \u062d\u062f\u060c \u0623\u0648 \u0642\u0648\u0644\u0648\u0627 \u0625\u0646\u0646\u064a \u0623\u0624\u0645\u0646 \u0628\u0647\u0627 \u0625\u0644\u0649 \u0627\u0644\u062d\u062f \u0627\u0644\u0630\u064a \u064a\u0643\u0641\u064a \u0644\u0627\u062d\u062a\u0631\u0627\u0645 \u0627\u0644\u0637\u0628 (\u0625\u0646\u0646\u064a \u0623\u0645\u0644\u0643 \u0645\u0646 \u0627\u0644\u062b\u0642\u0627\u0641\u0629 \u0645\u0627 \u064a\u0643\u0641\u064a \u0644\u0623\u0646 \u0644\u0627 \u0623\u0643\u0648\u0646 \u0645\u0646 \u0627\u0644\u0645\u0624\u0645\u0646\u064a\u0646 \u0628\u0627\u0644\u062e\u0631\u0627\u0641\u0627\u062a\u060c \u0648\u0644\u0643\u0646\u064a \u0623\u0624\u0645\u0646 \u0628\u0647\u0627 \u0645\u0639 \u0630\u0644\u0643). \u0644\u0627\u060c \u0644\u0627! \u0644\u0626\u0646 \u0643\u0646\u062a \u0644\u0627 \u0623\u062f\u0627\u0648\u064a \u0646\u0641\u0633\u064a\u060c \u0623\u0646 \u0645\u0631\u062f \u0630\u0644\u0643 \u0625\u0644\u0649 \u062e\u0628\u062b \u0648\u0634\u0631! \u0644\u0627 \u0634\u0643 \u0623\u0646\u0643\u0645 \u0644\u0627 \u062a\u062a\u0646\u0627\u0632\u0644\u0648\u0646 \u0625\u0644\u0649 \u062d\u064a\u062b \u062a\u0641\u0647\u0645\u0648\u0646 \u0647\u0630\u0627\u060c \u0648\u0644\u0643\u0646\u064a \u0623\u0646\u0627 \u0623\u0641\u0647\u0645\u0647","Listen!

Kirillov cried out rapturously. So it can be understood, if even someone like you understands! You understand now that the whole salvation for everyone is to prove this thought to them all. Who will prove it? I! I don\'t understand how, up to now, an atheist could know there is no God and not kill himself at once. To recognize that there is no God, and not to recognize at the same time that you have become God, is an absurdity, otherwise you must necessarily kill yourself. Once you recognize it, you are king, and you will not kill yourself but live in the chiefest glory. But one, the one who is first, must necessarily kill himself, otherwise who will begin and prove it? It is I who will necessarily kill myself in order to begin and prove it. I am still God against my will, and I am unhappy, because it is my duty to proclaim self-will. Everyone is unhappy, because everyone is afraid to proclaim self-will. That is why man has been so unhappy and poor up to now, because he was afraid to proclaim the chief point of self-will and was self-willed only on the margins, like a schoolboy. I am terribly unhappy, because I am terrible afraid. Fear is man\'s curse...But I will proclaim self-will, it is my duty to believe that I do not believe. I will begin, and end, and open the door. And save. Only this one thing will save all men and in the next generation transform them physically. for in the present physical aspect, so far as I have thought, it is in no way possible for man to be without the former God. For three years I have been searching for the attribute of my divinity, and I have found it: the attribute of my divinity is--Self-will! That is all, by which I can show in the main point my insubordination and my new fearsome freedom. For it is very fearsome. I kill myself to show my insubordination and my new fearsome freedom.","When you were talking to me here, I couldn\u2019t sit still; when you cried here, when you tormented yourself because you were jilted, because your love was slighted and disregarded, I felt that in my heart there was so much love for you.","My God, but what do I care about the laws of nature and arithmetic if for some reason these laws and two times two is four are not to my liking?

Only take care that you repent without ceasing, and chase away fear altogether. Believe that God loves you so as you cannot conceive of it; even with your sin and in your sin he loves you. And there is more joy in heaven over one repentant sinner than over ten righteous men4\u2014that was said long ago. Go, then, and do not be afraid. Do not be upset with people, do not take offense at their wrongs. Forgive the dead man in your heart for all the harm he did you; be reconciled with him truly.

Brothers, love is a teacher; but one must know how to acquire it, for it is hard to acquire, it is dearly bought, it is won slowly by long labour. For we must love not only occasionally, for a moment, but for ever. Everyone can love occasionally, even the wicked can.","I had come there not only to look at, but also to number myself sincerely and wholeheartedly with, the mob.

And so?It is well known that, sooner or later, towards the ends of their lives, many of these people have betrayed themselves by committing some ludicrous act or another, at times even of the most indecent sort.","Indeed, in that sense we\u2019re all rather often almost like mad people, only with the slight difference that the \u2018sick\u2019 are somewhat madder than we are, so that it\u2019s necessary to draw a line here.","\u0646\u0639\u0645 \u060c \u0631\u0628 \u062e\u0627\u0637\u0631 \u0647\u0648 \u0623\u0642\u0631\u0628 \u0627\u0644\u062e\u0648\u0627\u0637\u0631 \u0625\u0644\u0649 \u0627\u0644\u062c\u0646\u0648\u0646 \u060c \u0648\u0623\u062f\u0646\u0627\u0647\u0627 \u0625\u0644\u0649 \u0627\u0644\u0627\u0633\u062a\u062d\u0627\u0644\u0629 \u060c \u064a\u0628\u0644\u063a \u0645\u0646 \u0642\u0648\u0629 \u0631\u0633\u0648\u062e\u0647 \u0641\u064a \u0627\u0644\u063a\u0643\u0631 \u0623\u0646 \u0627\u0644\u0645\u0631\u0621 \u064a\u062e\u0627\u0644\u0647 \u0645\u0645\u0643\u0646 \u0627\u0644\u062a\u062d\u0642\u064a\u0642 \u060c \u062d\u062a\u0649 \u0625\u0630\u0627 \u0643\u0627\u0646 \u0647\u0630\u0627 \u0627\u0644\u062e\u0627\u0637\u0631 \u0645\u0631\u062a\u0628\u0637\u0627 \u0628\u0631\u063a\u0628\u0629 \u0642\u0648\u064a\u0629 \u0645\u0644\u062a\u0647\u0628\u0629 \u062c\u0627\u0645\u062d\u0629 \u0623\u0639\u062a\u0642\u062f \u0627\u0644\u0645\u0631\u0621 \u0623\u062e\u064a\u0631\u0627 \u0623\u0646\u0647 \u0623\u0645\u0631\u0627 \u062d\u062a\u0645\u064a \u060c \u0636\u0631\u0648\u0631\u064a \u060c \u0641\u0631\u0636\u0647 \u0627\u0644\u0642\u062f\u0631 \u0645\u0646\u0630 \u0627\u0644\u0623\u0632\u0644 \u060c \u0623\u0645\u0631 \u0644\u0627 \u064a\u0645\u0643\u0646 \u0625\u0644\u0627 \u0623\u0646 \u064a\u0643\u0648\u0646 \u060c \u0648\u0644\u0627 \u064a\u0645\u0643\u0646 \u0625\u0644\u0627 \u0623\u0646 \u064a\u062d\u062f\u062b! \u0648\u0628\u0645\u0627 \u0643\u0627\u0646 \u0647\u0647\u0646\u0627 \u0634\u0626 \u0623\u0643\u062b\u0631 \u0645\u0646 \u0630\u0644\u0643: \u0631\u0628\u0645\u0627 \u0643\u0627\u0646 \u0647\u0647\u0646\u0627 \u0645\u0632\u064a\u062c \u0645\u0646 \u0646\u0628\u0648\u0621\u0627\u062a \u064a\u062d\u0633\u0647\u0627 \u0627\u0644\u0645\u0631\u0621 \u060c \u0648\u0645\u0646 \u062c\u0647\u062f \u062e\u0627\u0631\u0642 \u062a\u0628\u0630\u0644\u0647 \u0627\u0644\u0625\u0631\u0627\u062f\u0629 \u060c \u0648\u0645\u0646 \u062e\u064a\u0627\u0644 \u0633\u0645\u0645 \u0627\u0644\u0645\u0631\u0621 \u0628\u0647 \u0646\u0641\u0633\u0647 \u0628\u0646\u0641\u0633\u0647 \u060c \u0648\u0645\u0646 \u0623\u0634\u064a\u0627\u0621 \u0623\u062e\u0631\u0649 \u0623\u064a\u0636\u0627 ... \u0644\u0633\u062a \u0623\u062f\u0631\u064a ...","\u0648 \u0644\u0648 \u0646\u0638\u0631\u0646\u0627 \u0627\u0644\u064a \u062c\u0645\u064a\u0639 \u0627\u0646\u0648\u0627\u0639 \u0627\u0644\u0628\u0634\u0631 \u0644\u062d\u0642 \u0644\u0646\u0627 \u0627\u0646 \u0646\u0633\u0623\u0644 \u0645\u0646 \u0647\u0645 \u0627\u0648\u0644\u0626\u0643 \u0627\u0644\u0630\u064a\u0646 \u064a\u0635\u0645\u062f\u0648\u0646 \u0641\u064a \u0627\u0644\u0648\u0627\u0642\u0639 \u0644\u0644\u0627\u0645\u062a\u062d\u0627\u0646 \u0648 \u064a\u0628\u0631\u0647\u0646\u0648\u0646 \u0639\u0644\u0649 \u0627\u0646\u0647\u0645 \u0627\u062e\u064a\u0627\u0631 \u0637\u064a\u0628\u0648\u0646 !","\u0627\u0644\u0628\u0624\u0633 \u0631\u0630\u064a\u0644\u0629 \u060c \u064a\u0633\u062a\u0637\u064a\u0639 \u0627\u0644\u0645\u0631\u0621 \u0641\u064a \u0627\u0644\u0641\u0642\u0631 \u0623\u0646 \u064a\u0638\u0644 \u0645\u062d\u0627\u0638\u0641\u0627\u064b \u0639\u0644\u0649 \u0646\u0628\u0644 \u0639\u0648\u0627\u0637\u0641\u0647 \u0627\u0644\u0641\u0637\u0631\u064a\u0629\u060c \u0623\u0645\u0627 \u0641\u064a \u0627\u0644\u0628\u0624\u0633 \u0641\u0644\u0627 \u064a\u0633\u062a\u0637\u064a\u0639 \u0630\u0644\u0643 \u064a\u0648\u0645\u0627\u064b \u060c \u0648\u0645\u0627 \u0645\u0646 \u0623\u062d\u062f \u064a\u0633\u062a\u0637\u064a\u0639\u0647 \u0642\u0637 \u060c \u0625\u0630\u0627 \u0643\u0646\u062a \u0641\u064a \u0627\u0644\u0628\u0624\u0633 \u0641\u0625\u0646\u0643 \u0644\u0627 \u062a\u0637\u0631\u062f \u0645\u0646 \u0645\u062c\u062a\u0645\u0639 \u0627\u0644\u0628\u0634\u0631 \u0636\u0631\u0628\u0627\u064b \u0628\u0627\u0644\u0639\u0635\u0627 \u060c \u0628\u0644 \u062a\u0637\u0631\u062f \u0645\u0646\u0647 \u0636\u0631\u0628\u0627\u064b \u0628\u0627\u0644\u0645\u0643\u0646\u0633\u0629 \u0628\u063a\u064a\u0629 \u0625\u0630\u0644\u0627\u0644\u0643 \u0645\u0632\u064a\u062f\u0627\u064b \u0645\u0646 \u0627\u0644\u0625\u0630\u0644\u0627\u0644 .","The riff-raff that exists in every society rises to the surface in any time of transition, and is utterly devoid not only of any goal, but even the slightest indication of an idea, and merely gives expression to restlessness and impatience as forcefully as it can.

Dreams seem to be spurred on not by reason but by desire, not by the head but by the heart, and yet what complicated tricks my reason has played sometimes in dreams, what utterly incomprehensible things happen to it!","You have to be all too basely in love with yourself to write about yourself without shame.","Of the eternal questions, nothing else: is there a God, is there immortality? And those who do not believe in God will talk of socialism or anarchy, of the transformation of all humanity on a new pattern, which all comes to the same thing, they\'re the same questions turned inside out.","He vividly recalled those old doubts and perplexities, and it seemed to him that it was no mere chance that he recalled them now. It struck him as strange and grotesque, that he should have stopped at the same spot as before, as though he actually imagined he could think the same thoughts, be interested in the same theories and pictures that had interested him ... so short a time ago. He felt it almost amusing, and yet it wrung his heart. ...It seemed to him, he had cut himself off from everyone and from everything at that moment.","The first thing is to lower the level of education, science and accomplishment.1 A high level of science and accomplishment is accessible only to people of high ability, and there\u2019s no need for high ability! People of high ability have always seized power and been despots. People of high ability can\u2019t help but be despots and have always corrupted more than they have brought benefit; they are sent into exile or executed.","There is silent and long-suffering sorrow to be met with among the peasantry. It withdraws into itself and is still. But there is a grief that breaks out, and from that minute it bursts into tears and finds vent in wailing. This is particularly common with women. But it is no lighter a grief than the silent. Lamentations comfort only by lacerating the heart still more. Such grief does not desire consolation. It feeds on the sense of its hopelessness. Lamentations spring only from the constant craving to reopen the wound.","\u0623\u0639\u0631\u0641 \u0623\u0646 \u0623\u062d\u062f \u0643\u062a\u0627\u0628\u0643\u0645 \u0642\u0627\u0644 \u0641\u0649 \u0643\u062a\u0627\u0628 (\u0625\u0646 \u0623\u0643\u0628\u0631 \u0645\u0623\u062b\u0631\u0629 \u0645\u0646 \u0645\u0622\u062b\u0631 \u0627\u0644\u0625\u0646\u0633\u0627\u0646 \u0647\u0649 \u0623\u0646 \u064a\u0639\u0631\u0641 \u0643\u064a\u0641 \u064a\u0642\u062a\u0635\u0631 \u0641\u0649 \u0627\u0644\u062d\u064a\u0627\u0629 \u0639\u0644\u0649 \u0627\u0644\u0642\u064a\u0627\u0645 \u0628\u062f\u0648\u0631 \xab\u0643\u0648\u0645\u0628\u0627\u0631\u0633\xbb.)\u0639\u0644\u0649 \u0644\u0633\u0627\u0646 \u0627\u0644\u0623\u0645\u064a\u0631","I will tell you another thing that would be better, and that is, if I myself believe even an iota of what I have just written.

And how tiresome, how insolent your outbursts are, and at the same time, how scared you are! You talk nonsense and are pleased with it; you say imprudent things and are constantly afraid of them and apologizing for them. You declare that you are afraid of nothing and at the same time try to ingratiate yourself with us. You declare that you are gnashing your teeth and at the same time you try to be witty so as to amuse us.

You may perhaps really have suffered, but you have no respect whatsoever for your own suffering. You may be truthful in what you have said but you have no modesty; out of the pettiest vanity you bring your truth to public exposure, to the market place, to ignominity.","I want to be there when every one suddenly understands what it has all been for.

Here I, for instance, quite naturally want to live, in order to satisfy all my capacities for life, and not simply my capacity for reasoning, that is, not simply one twentieth of my capacity for life. What does reason know? Reason only knows what it has succeeded in learning (some things, perhaps, it will never learn; this is a poor comfort, but why not say so frankly?) and human nature acts as a whole, with everything that is in it, consciously or unconsciously, and, even if it goes wrong, it lives.","Se une jo vetem nuk isha nopran e nurzi, por as i lig e as keqdashes nuk isha, ama edhe ndonje hi\xe7 nuk ehste se isha.

Why, we have come almost to looking upon real life as an effort, almost as hard work, and we are all privately agreed that it is better in books. And why do we fuss and fume sometimes? Why are we perverse and ask for something else? We don\'t know what ourselves. It would be the worse for us if our petulant prayers were answered.

I am some sort of ghost of life who has lost all ends and beginnings, and I\'ve finally even forgotten what to call myself...You\'re eternally angry, you want reason only, but I will repeat to you once more that I would give all of that life beyond the stars, all ranks and honors, only to be incarnated in the soul of a two-hundred-and-fifty-pound merchant\'s wife and light candles to God.","[The Devil] In my opinion, there is no need to destroy anything, one needs only destroy the idea of God in mankind, that\'s where the business should start! One should begin with that, with that--oh, blind men, of no understanding! Once mankind has renounced God, one and all (and I believe that this period, analogous to the geological periods, will come), then the entire old world view will fall of itself, without antrhopophagy, and, above all, the entire former morality, and everything will be new. People will come together in order to take from life all that it can give, but, of course, for happiness and joy in this world only. Man will be exalted with the spirit of the divine, tatanic pride, and the man-god will appear. Man, his will and his science no longer limited, conquering nature every hour, will thereby every hour experience such lofty delight as will replace for him all his former hopes of heavenly delight. Each will know himself utterly mortal, without resurrection, and will accept death proudly and calmly, like a god. Out of pride he will understand that he should not murmur against the momentariness of life, and he will love his brother then without any reward. Love will satisfy only the moment of life, but the very awareness of its momentariness will increase its fire, inasmuch as previously it was diffused in hopes of an eternal love beyond the grave.","I understand solidarity in sin among men; solidarity in retribution I also understand; but what solidarity in sin do little children have? ...And if the suffering of children goes to make up the sum of suffering needed to buy truth, then I assert beforehand that the whole of truth is not worth such a price.","You are going to perform a virtuous deed, but you don\'t even believe in virtue--that\'s what makes you angry and torments you, that\'s why you\'re so vindictive.","There are strange friendships: two friends almost want to devour each other, and they spend their entire lives living that way, but meanwhile they cannot part.","...the laws of nature have continually all my life offended me more than anything.","And the son bursting into his father\'s house, killing him, and at the same time not killing him, this is not even a novel, not a poem, it is a sphinx posing riddles, which it, of course, will not solve itself. If he killed him, he killed him; how can it be that he killed him and yet did not kill him--who can understand that? Then it is announced to us that our tribune is the tribune of truth and sensible ideas, and so from this tribune of \'sensible ideas\' an axiom resounds, accompanied by an oath, that to call the murder of a father parricide is simply a prejudice! But if parricide is a prejudice, and if every child ought to ask his father, \'Father, why should I love you?\'--what will become of us, what will become of the foundations of society, where will the family end up? Parricide--don\'t you see, it\'s just the \'brimstone\' of some Moscow merchant\'s wife? The most precious, the most sacred precepts concerning the purpose and future of the Russian courts are presented perversely and frivolously, only to achieve a certain end, to achieve the acquittal of that which cannot be acquitted. \'Oh, overwhelm him with mercy,\' the defense attorney exclaims, and that is just what the criminal wants, and tomorrow everyone will see how overwhelmed he is! And is the defense attorney not being too modest in asking only for the defendant\'s acquittal? Why does he not ask that a fund be established in the parricide\'s name, in order to immortalize his deed for posterity and the younger generation? The Gospel and religion are corrected: it\'s all mysticism, he says, and ours is the only true Christianity, tested by the analysis of reason and sensible ideas. And so a false image of Christ is held up to us! With what measure ye mete, it shall be measured to you,\' the defense attorney exclaims, and concludes then and there that Christ commanded us to measure with the same measure as it is measured to us--and that from the tribune of truth and sensible ideas! We glance into the Gospel only on the eve of our speeches, in order to make a brilliant display of our familiarity with what is, after all, a rather original work, which may prove useful and serve for a certain effect, in good measure, all in good measure! Yet Christ tells us precisely not to do so, to beware of doing so, because that is what the wicked world does, whereas we must forgive and turn our cheek, and not measure with the same measure as our offenders measure to us. This is what our God taught us, and not that it is a prejudice to forbid children to kill their own fathers. And let us not, from the rostrum of truth and sensible ideas, correct the Gospel of our God, whom the defense attorney deems worthy of being called merely \'the crucified lover of mankind,\' in opposition to the whole of Orthodox Russia, which calls out to him: \'For thou art our God...!","If the evil-doing of men moves you to indignation and overwhelming distress, even to a desire for vengeance on the evil-doers, shun above all things that feeling. Go at once and seek suffering for yourself, as though you were yourself guilty of that wrong. Accept that suffering and bear it and your heart will find comfort, and you will understand that you too are guilty, for you might have been a light to the evil-doers, even as the one man sinless, and you were not a light to them. If you had been a light, you would have lightened the path for others too, and the evil-doer might perhaps have been saved by your light from his sin. And even though your light was shining, yet you see men were not saved by it, hold firm and doubt not the power of the heavenly light. Believe that if they were not saved, they will be saved hereafter. And if they are not saved hereafter, then their sons will be saved, for your light will not die even when you are dead. The righteous man departs, but his light remains.","You cannot imagine what wrath and sadness overcome your whole soul when a great idea, which you have long cherished as holy, is caught up by the ignorant and dragged forth before fools like themselves into the street, and you suddenly meet it in the market unrecognizable, in the mud, absurdly set up, without proportion, without harmony, the plaything of foolish louts!","Jam njeri i semure...

And I want to add, too, that when such young creatures, such sweet young creatures want to say something so clever and profound, they show at once so truthfully and naively in their faces, \\"Here I am saying something clever and profound now\\" \u2014 and that is not from vanity, as it is with any one like me, but one sees that she appreciates it awfully herself, and believes in it, and thinks a lot of it, and imagines that you think a lot of all that, just as she does. Oh, truthfulness! It\'s by that they conquer us. How exquisite it was in her!","So it is sometimes with the most good-natured people of weak nerves, who in spite of their kindliness are carried away till they find enjoyment in their own grief and anger, and try to express themselves at any cost, even that of wounding some other innocent creature, always by preference the one nearest and dearest.","There are some people about whom it is difficult to say anything which would describe them immediately and fully in their most typical and characteristic aspects; these are the people who are usually called \\"ordinary\\" and accounted as \\"the majority,\\" and who actually do make up the great majority of society. In their novels and stories writers most often try to choose and present vividly and artistically social types which are extremely seldom encountered in real life, and which are nevertheless more real than real life itself. Podkolyosin, viewed as a type, in perhaps exaggerated, but he is hardly unknown. How many clever people having learned from Gogol about Podkolyosin at once discover that great numbers of their friends bear a terrific resemblance to Podkolyosin. They knew before Gogol that their friends were like Podkolyosin, except they did not know yet that that was their name...Nevertheless the question remains before us: what is the novelist to do with the absolutely \\"ordinary\\" people, and how can he present them to readers so that they are at all interesting? To leave them out of a story completely is not possible, because ordinary people are at every moment, by and large, the necessary links in the chain of human affairs; leaving them out, therefore, means to destroy credibility. To fill a novel entirely with types or, simply for the sake of interest, strange and unheard-of people, would be improbable and most likely not even interesting. In our opinion the writer must try to find interesting and informative touches even among commonplace people. When, for example, the very nature of certain ordinary persons consists precisely of their perpetual and unvarying ordinariness, or, better still, when in spite of their most strenuous efforts to life themselves out of the rut of ordinariness and routine, then such persons acquire a certain character of their own-the typical character of mediocrity which refuses to remain what it is and desires at all costs to become original and independent, without having the slightest capacity for independence.","\u0627\u0644\u063a\u064a\u0631\u0629! \\"\u0644\u064a\u0633 \u0639\u0637\u064a\u0644

The difficulty is that the intelligent \\"ordinary\\" man, even if he does imagine himself at times (and perhaps all his life) a person of genius and originality, nevertheless retains within his heart a little worm of doubt, which sometimes leads the intelligent man in the end to absolute despair. If he does yield in this belief, he is still completely poisoned with inward-driven vanity.","Not everything can be told in words, certain things it\'s better never to tell.","I have sometimes thought that if ever I return home, I shall get more grief than joy from my impressions there.

I want to say to you, about myself, that I am a child of this age, a child of unfaith and scepticism, and probably (indeed I know it) shall remain so to the end of my life. How dreadfully has it tormented me (and torments me even now)\u2014this longing for faith, which is all the stronger for the proofs I have against it.

When he was better, he remembered the dreams he had had while he was feverish and delirious. He dreamt that the whole world was condemned to a terrible new strange plague that had come to Europe from the depths of Asia. All were to be destroyed except a very few chosen. Some new sorts of microbes were attacking the bodies of men, but these microbes were endowed with intelligence and will. Men attacked by them became at once mad and furious. But never had men considered themselves so intellectual and so completely in possession of the truth as these sufferers, never had they considered their decisions, their scientific conclusions, their moral convictions so infallible. Whole villages, whole towns and peoples went mad from the infection. All were excited and did not understand one another. Each thought that he alone had the truth and was wretched looking at the others, beat himself on the breast, wept, and wrung his hands. They did not know how to judge and could not agree what to consider evil and what good; they did not know whom to blame, whom to justify. Men killed each other in a sort of senseless spite. They gathered together in armies against one another, but even on the march the armies would begin attacking each other, the ranks would be broken and the soldiers would fall on each other, stabbing and cutting, biting and devouring each other. The alarm bell was ringing all day long in the towns; men rushed together, but why they were summoned and who was summoning them no one knew. The most ordinary trades were abandoned, because everyone proposed his own ideas, his own improvements, and they could not agree. The land too was abandoned. Men met in groups, agreed on something, swore to keep together, but at once began on something quite different from what they had proposed. They accused one another, fought and killed each other. There were conflagrations and famine. All men and all things were involved in destruction. The plague spread and moved further and further. Only a few men could be saved in the whole world. They were a pure chosen people, destined to found a new race and a new life, to renew and purify the earth, but no one had seen these men, no one had heard their words and their voices.","...The men of those days...were absolutely not the same people that we are now; it was not the same race as now, in our age, really, it seems we are a different species...In those days they were men of one idea, but now we are more nervous, more developed, more sensitive; men capable of two or three ideas at once...Modern men are broader-minded - and I swear that this prevents their being so all-of-a-piece as they were in those days.","he so respected and feared his wife that he was very near loving her.","I swear to you that I am not quite such an ass as I like to appear sometimes, although I am rather an ass, I admit.","I can\'t bear the thought that a man of lofty mind and heart begins with the ideal of the Madonna and ends with the ideal of Sodom.","Od na\u0161eg razgovora, naravno, nije bilo ni\u0161ta.

Kill her, take her money and with the help of it devote oneself to the service of humanity and the good of all. What do you think, would not one tiny crime be wiped out by thousands of good deeds?

Some thoughts or fragments of thoughts, some images without order or coherence floated before his mind--faces of people he had seen in his childhood or met somewhere once, whom he would never have recalled, the belfry of the church at V., the billiard table in a restaurant and some officers playing billiards, the smell of cigars in some underground tobacco shop, a tavern room, a back staircase quite dark, all sloppy with dirty water and strewn with egg-shells, and the Sunday bells floating in from somewhere.... The images followed one another, whirling like a hurricane.

For these pitiful creatures are concerned not only to find what one or the other can worship, but to find community of worship is the chief misery of every man individually and of all humanity from the beginning of time.

They fail to understand that to sacrifice five or six years of their seething youth to hard & tedious study \u2026 is utterly beyond the strength of many of them.","Human nature is not taken into account, it is excluded, it\'s not supposed to exist! They don\'t recognise that humanity, developing by a historical living process, will become at last a normal society, but they believe that a social system that has come out of some mathematical brain is going to organise all humanity at once and make it just and sinless in an instant, quicker than any living process! That\'s why they instinctively dislike history, \'nothing but ugliness and stupidity in it,\' and they explain it all as stupidity! That\'s why they so dislike the living process of life; they don\'t want a living soul! The living soul demands life, the soul won\'t obey the rules of mechanics, the soul is an object of suspicion, the soul is retrograde! But what they want though it smells of death and can be made of india-rubber, at least is not alive, has no will, is servile and won\'t revolt!

The phalanstery is ready, indeed, but your human nature is not ready for the phalanstery--it wants life, it hasn\'t completed its vital process, it\'s too soon for the graveyard! You can\'t skip over nature by logic.","There are bookish dreams here, sir, there is a heart chafed by theories;","Des Grieux was like all Frenchmen, that is, cheerful and amiable when it was necessary and profitable, and insufferably dull when the necessity to be cheerful and amiable ceased. A Frenchman is rarely amiable by nature; he is always amiable as if on command, out of calculation. If, for instance, he sees the necessity of being fantastic, original, out of the ordinary, then his fantasy, being most stupid and unnatural, assembles itself out of a priori accepted and long-trivialized forms. The natural Frenchman consists of a most philistine, petty, ordinary positiveness--in short, the dullest being in the world. In my opinion, only novices, and Russian young ladies in particular, are attracted to Frenchmen. Any decent being will at once notice and refuse to put up with this conventionalism of the pre-established forms of salon amiability, casualness, and gaiety.","Why did I accept death?

And there are things he won\'t reveal even to friends, only, perhaps, to himself, and there, too, in secret. And finally, there are things he is afraid to reveal even to himself, and every decent man has quite an accumulation of them. In fact, the more decent the man, the more of them he has stored up.","we don\u2019t even know what living means now, what it is, and what it is called? Leave us alone without books and we shall be lost and in confusion at once. We shall not know what to join on to, what to cling to, what to love and what to hate, what to respect and what to despise. We are oppressed at being men\u2014men with a real individual body and blood, we are ashamed of it, we think it a disgrace and try to contrive to be some sort of impossible generalised man.","The reason why I consider myself a clever man is simply because I could never in my life finish anything I\'d started. All right, I am a talker, a harmless, boring talker as we all are. But what can I do if the direct and sole purpose of every intelligent man is to talk, that is to say, to waste his time deliberately?","Young man, he went on, raising his head again, \u201cin your face I seem to read some trouble of mind. When you came in I read it, and that was why I addressed you at once. For in unfolding to you the story of my life, I do not wish to make myself a laughing-stock before these idle listeners, who indeed know all about it already, but I am looking for a man of feeling and education. Know then that my wife was educated in a high-class school for the daughters of noblemen, and on leaving, she danced the shawl dance before the governor and other personages for which she was presented with a gold medal and a certificate of merit. The medal \u2026 well, the medal of course was sold\u2014long ago, hm \u2026 but the certificate of merit is in her trunk still and not long ago she showed it to our landlady. And although she is most continually on bad terms with the landlady, yet she wanted to tell some one or other of her past honours and of the happy days that are gone. I don\u2019t condemn her for it. I don\u2019t blame her, for the one thing left her is recollection of the past, and all the rest is dust and ashes. Yes, yes, she is a lady of spirit, proud and determined. She scrubs the floors herself and has nothing but black bread to eat, but won\u2019t allow herself to be treated with disrespect. That\u2019s why she would not overlook Mr. Lebeziatnikov\u2019s rudeness to her, and so when he gave her a beating for it, she took to her bed more from the hurt to her feelings than from the blows. She was a widow when I married her, with three children, one smaller than the other. She married her first husband, an infantry officer, for love, and ran away with him from her father\u2019s house. She was exceedingly fond of her husband; but he gave way to cards, got into trouble and with that he died. He used to beat her at the end: and although she paid him back, of which I have authentic documentary evidence, to this day she speaks of him with tears and she throws him up at me; and I am glad, I am glad that, though only in imagination, she should think of herself as having once been happy.\u2026 And she was left at his death with three children in a wild and remote district where I happened to be at the time; and she was left in such hopeless poverty that, although I have seen many ups and downs of all sorts, I don\u2019t feel equal to describing it even. Her relations had all thrown her off. And she was proud, too, excessively proud.\u2026 And then, honoured sir, and then, I, being at the time a widower, with a daughter of fourteen left me by my first wife, offered her my hand, for I could not bear the sight of such suffering. You can judge the extremity of her calamities, that she, a woman of education and culture and distinguished family, should have consented to be my wife. But she did! Weeping and sobbing and wringing her hands, she married me! For she had nowhere to turn! Do you understand, sir, do you understand what it means when you have absolutely nowhere to turn? No, that you don\u2019t understand yet\u2026\u201d","\u0627\u0646 \u0627\u0644\u0637\u0628\u064a\u0639\u0629 \u062a\u0646\u062c\u0628 \u0627\u0644\u0634\u0627\u0630 \u0627\u0644\u0623\u0634\u0648\u0647 .. \u062b\u0645 \u062a\u0642\u0636\u0649 \u0639\u0644\u064a\u0647 \u0628\u062f\u0644\u0627 \u0645\u0646 \u0623\u0646 \u062a\u0631\u062b\u0649 \u0644\u062d\u0627\u0644\u0647 \u0648\u062a\u0631\u0623\u0641 \u0628\u0647","And so, since then, I\'ve been preaching.

I am an unattractive man. I believe my liver is diseased. However, I know nothing at all about my disease, and do not know for certain what ails me. I don\u2019t consult a doctor for it, and never have, though I have a respect for medicine and doctors. Besides, I am extremely superstitious, sufficiently so to respect medicine, anyway (I am well-educated enough not to be superstitious, but I am superstitious). No, I refuse to consult a doctor from spite. That you probably will not understand. Well, I understand it, though. Of course, I can\u2019t explain who it is precisely that I am mortifying in this case by my spite: I am perfectly well aware that I cannot \u201cpay out the doctors by not consulting them; I know better than anyone that by all this I am only injuring myself and no one else. But still, if I don\u2019t consult a doctor it is from spite. My liver is bad, well \u2014 let it get worse! I have been going on like that for a long time \u2014 twenty years. Now I am forty. I used to be in the government service, but am no longer. I was a spiteful official. I was rude and took pleasure in being so. I did not take bribes, you see, so I was bound to find a recompense in that, at least. (A poor jest, but I will not scratch it out. I wrote it thinking it would sound very witty; but now that I have seen myself that I only wanted to show off in a despicable way, I will not scratch it out on purpose!)\u201d","They understood nothing, none of life\'s realities, and, I swear to you, this was what made me most indignant.","Truly,\' I answered him, \'all things are good and fair, because all is truth.

You have to admit that. It therefore follows that society is not in the least protected, for though a harmful member is cut off automatically and exiled to some remote spot just to get rid of him, another criminal takes his place at once, and often, two, perhaps. If anything does protect society even today and indeed reforms the criminal himself and brings about his regeneration, it is, again, only the law of Christ, which reveals itself in the awareness of one\'s own consciousness. Only by recognizing his own guilt as a son of a Christian society, that is, of the Church, does the criminal recognize his guilt towards society itself, that is, towards the Church. The criminal today, therefore, is capable of recognizing his guilt only towards the Church, and not towards the State.","My friends, ask gladness from God. Be glad as children, as birds in the sky. And let man\'s sin not disturb you in your efforts, do not feat that it will dampen your endeavor and keep it from being fulfilled, do not say, \\"Sin is strong, impiety is strong, the bad environment is strong, and we are lonely and powerless, the bad environment will dampen us and keep our good endeavor from being fulfilled.\\" Flee from such despondency, my children!

At any rate, I have all my life, as it were, turned my eyes away and never could look people straight in the face.","By the way, a Bulgarian I met lately in Moscow,\\" Ivan went on, seeming not to hear his brother\'s words, \\"told me about the crimes committed by Turks and Circassians in all parts of Bulgaria through fear of a general rising of the Slavs. They burn villages, murder, outrage women and children, they nail their prisoners by the ears to the fences, leave them so till morning, and in the morning they hang them- all sorts of things you can\'t imagine. People talk sometimes of bestial cruelty, but that\'s a great injustice and insult to the beasts; a beast can never be so cruel as a man, so artistically cruel. The tiger only tears and gnaws, that\'s all he can do. He would never think of nailing people by the ears, even if he were able to do it.These Turks took a pleasure in torturing children, -too; cutting the unborn child from the mothers womb, and tossing babies up in the air and catching them on the points of their bayonets before their mothers\' eyes. Doing it before the mothers\' eyes was what gave zest to the amusement. Here is another scene that I thought very interesting. Imagine a trembling mother with her baby in her arms, a circle of invading Turks around her. They\'ve planned a diversion: they pet the baby, laugh to make it laugh. They succeed, the baby laughs. At that moment a Turk points a pistol four inches from the baby\'s face. The baby laughs with glee, holds out its little hands to the pistol, and he pulls the trigger in the baby\'s face and blows out its brains. Artistic, wasn\'t it? By the way, Turks are particularly fond of sweet things, they say.","\u0648\u062d\u064a\u0646 \u064a\u0645\u062a\u0644\u0626 \u0642\u0644\u0628 \u0641\u062a\u0627\u0629 \u0628\u0627\u0644\u0634\u0641\u0642\u0629 \u0627\u0646\u0645\u0627 \u062a\u062a\u0639\u0631\u0636 \u0644\u0623\u0643\u0628\u0631 \u062e\u0637\u0631. \u0641\u0647\u0649 \u062a\u0631\u064a\u062f \u062d\u062a\u0645\u0627 \u0623\u0646 \u062a\u0646\u0642\u0630\u060c \u0623\u0646 \u062a\u0631\u062f \u0625\u0644\u0649 \u0627\u0644\u0635\u0648\u0627\u0628\u060c \u0623\u0646 \u062a\u062d\u064a\u0649\u060c \u0623\u0646 \u062a\u0628\u0639\u062b... \u0623\u0646 \u062a\u0641\u0639\u0644 \u0643\u0644 \u0645\u0627 \u064a\u0645\u0643\u0646 \u062a\u062e\u064a\u0644\u0647 \u0639\u0644\u0649 \u0647\u0630\u0627 \u0627\u0644\u0646\u0645\u0637 \u0645\u0646 \u0627\u0644\u0645\u0639\u0627\u0646\u064a. \u0648\u0633\u0631\u0639\u0627\u0646 \u0645\u0627 \u0623\u062f\u0631\u0643\u062a \u0623\u0646 \u0627\u0644\u0637\u0627\u0626\u0631 \u0627\u0644\u0635\u063a\u064a\u0631 \u0642\u062f \u064a\u0637\u064a\u0631 \u0625\u0644\u0649 \u0627\u0644\u0634\u0628\u0643\u0629 \u0645\u0646 \u062a\u0644\u0642\u0627\u0621 \u0646\u0641\u0633\u0647","\u0645\u0627 \u0627\u0644\u0639\u0642\u0644 \u0625\u0644\u0627 \u062e\u0627\u062f\u0645 \u0627\u0644\u0623\u0647\u0648\u0627\u0621.","I never found anything in the company of people, however I tried, and I did try; at least all my peers, all my comrades to a man, proved to be inferior to me in thinking; I don\'t remember a single exception.","\xabCapita d\'incontrare persone, anche a noi totalmente sconosciute, che ci cominciano ad interessare fin dal primo sguardo, per cos\xec dire di colpo, prima che abbiano detto una parola\xbb","Gentlemen, let us suppose that man is not stupid.

Put it to the test and cast your eyes upon the history of mankind. What will you see? Is it a grand spectacle? Grand, if you like. Take the Colossus of Rhodes, for instance, that\u2019s worth something. With good reason Mr. Anaevsky testifies of it that some say that it is the work of man\u2019s hands, while others maintain that it has been created by nature herself. Is it many-coloured? Maybe it is many-coloured, too: if one takes the dress uniforms, military and civilian, of all peoples in all ages\u2014that alone is worth something, and if you take the undress uniforms you will never get to the end of it; no historian would be equal to the job. Is it monotonous? May be it\u2019s monotonous too: it\u2019s fighting and fighting; they are fighting now, they fought first and they fought last\u2014you will admit, that it is almost too monotonous.

Anyway, man has always been somehow afraid of this two times two makes four, and I am afraid of it even now. Granted that man does nothing but seek that two times two makes four, that he sails the oceans, sacrifices his life in the quest, but to succeed, really to find it -- he is somehow afraid, I assure you.

I wanted to stifle all that was continuously boiling up inside me through external impressions. Out of all external impressions, reading was the only one possible for me. Of course, reading helped a lot - it excited, delighted and tormented me. But at times it bored me to death. For all that I still wanted to be doing things and I would suddenly plunge into dark, subterranean, vile, not so much depravity as petty dissipation. My mean, trivial, lusts were keen and fiery as a result of my constant, morbid irritability. The surges were hysterical, always accompanied by tears and convulsion. Apart from reading I had nowhere to turn - I mean, there was nothing in my surroundings that I could respect then or to which I might have been attracted. Moreover, dreadful ennui was seething within me, a hysterical craving for contradictions and contrasts would make its presence felt [...].","\u2026but it is in despair that the most burning pleasures occur, especially when one is all too highly conscious of the hopelessness of one\u2019s position.","...poverty is not a vice, that\'s a true saying. Yet I know that drunkenness too is not a virtue and that\'s even truer. But destitution, dear sir, destitution is a vice. In poverty you may still retain your innate nobility of soul , but in destitution-never-no-one. For destitution a man is not chased out of society with a stick, he is swept out with a broom to make it as humiliating as possible; and quite right, too, for in destitution I am the first to humiliate my self.","Life is now given to man at the cost of pain and fear. Here, they are blinded by this sometimes. Now man is not yet that man. There will be another, new person, happy and proud, and for him it wouldn\u2019t matter the death-life. He who overcomes pain and fear will become God himself. There will not be that God any longer.","Now, I am living out my life in my corner, taunting myself with the spiteful and useless consolation that an intelligent man cannot become anything seriously, and it is only the fool who becomes anything. Yes, a man in the nineteenth century must and morally ought to be pre-eminently a characterless creature; a man of character, an active man is pre-eminently a limited creature. That is my conviction of forty years. I am forty years old now, and you know forty years is a whole lifetime; you know it is extreme old age. To live longer than forty years is bad manners, is vulgar, immoral. Who does live beyond forty? Answer that, sincerely and honestly. I will tell you who do: fools and worthless fellows. I tell all old men that to their face, all these venerable old men, all these silver-haired and reverend seniors! I tell the whole world that to its face! I have a right to say so, for I shall go on living to sixty myself. To seventy! To eighty!... Stay, let me take breath...","Oh, of course, there is another meaning, another interesting interpretation of the word \'father,\' which insists that my father, though a monster, though a villain to his children, is still my father simply because he begot me. But this meaning is, so to speak, a mystical one, which I do not understand with my reason, but can only accept by faith, or, more precisely, on faith, like many other things that I do not understand, but that religion nonetheless tells me to believe. But in that case let it remain outside the sphere of real life. While within the sphere of real life, which not only has its rights, but itself imposes great obligations--within this sphere, if we wish to be humane, to be Christians finally, it is our duty and obligation to foster only those convictions that are justified by reason and experience, that have passed through the crucible of analysis, in a word, to act sensibly and not senselessly as in dreams or delirium, so as not to bring harm to a man, so as not to torment and ruin a man. Then, then it will be a real Christian deed, not only a mystical one, but a sensible and truly philanthropic deed...let us decide the question as reason and the love of man dictate, and not as dictated by mystical notions.","Consciousness is man\'s greatest misfortune, still I know that man loves it and will not exchange it for any satisfactions.","Everything is habit with men, everything even in their social and political relations. Habit is the great motive-power.","As for my division of people into ordinary and extraordinary, I acknowledge that it\u2019s somewhat arbitrary, but I don\u2019t insist upon exact numbers. I only believe in my leading idea that men are in general divided by a law of nature into two categories, inferior (ordinary), that is, so to say, material that serves only to reproduce its kind, and men who have the gift or the talent to utter a new word. There are, of course, innumerable sub- divisions, but the distinguishing features of both categories are fairly well marked. The first category, generally speaking, are men conservative in temperament and law-abiding; they live under control and love to be controlled. To my thinking it is their duty to be controlled, because that\u2019s their vocation, and there is nothing humiliating in it for them. The second category all transgress the law; they are destroyers or disposed to destruction according to their capacities. The crimes of these men are of course relative and varied; for the most part they seek in very varied ways the destruction of the present for the sake of the better. But if such a one is forced for the sake of his idea to step over a corpse or wade through blood, he can, I maintain, find within himself, in his conscience, a sanction for wading through blood\u2014that depends on the idea and its dimensions, note that. It\u2019s only in that sense I speak of their right to crime in my article (you remember it began with the legal question). There\u2019s no need for such anxiety, however; the masses will scarcely ever admit this right, they punish them or hang them (more or less), and in doing so fulfil quite justly their conservative vocation. But the same masses set these criminals on a pedestal in the next generation and worship them (more or less). The first category is always the man of the present, the second the man of the future. The first preserve the world and people it, the second move the world and lead it to its goal. Each class has an equal right to exist. In fact, all have equal rights with me\u2014and vive la guerre \xe9ternelle\u2014till the New Jerusalem, of course!","Las desgracias ajenas no nos instruyen.","Daca, in realitate, omul nu este ticalos - omul in genere, semintia umana - atunci toate celelalte nu sunt decat prejudecati, temeri scornite de mintea noastra, si atunci nu mai este nicio stavila, toate sunt asa cum trebuie sa fie!","Um momento total de felicidade?

People talk to you a great deal about your education, but some good, sacred memory, preserved from childhood, is perhaps the best education. If a man carries many such memories with him into life, he is safe to the end of his days, and if one has only one good memory left in one\'s heart, even that may sometime be the means of saving us. Perhaps we may even grow wicked later on, may be unable to refrain from a bad action, may laugh at men\'s tears and at those people who say as Kolya did just now, \'I want to suffer for all men,\' and may even jeer spitefully at such people. But however bad we may become -- which God forbid -- [. . .] if we do become so will not dare to laugh inwardly at having been kind and good at this moment! What\'s more, perhaps, that one memory may keep him from great evil and he will reflect and say, \'Yes, I was good and brave and honest then!\' Let him laugh to himself, that\'s no matter, a man often laughs at what\'s good and kind. That\'s only from thoughtlessness. But I assure you, boys, that as he laughs he will say at once in his heart, \'No, I do wrong to laugh, for that\'s not a thing to laugh at.","What is most mortifying of all is that it is chance - simply a barbarous, lagging chance.

It is easy to shove them under someone\'s nose. Who wrote them, were they human beings?\\"\\"The Holy Spirit wrote them,\\" I said.\\"Its easy for you to babble,\\" he smiled again, but this time almost hatefully. I again took the book, opened it to a different place, and showed him the Epistle to the Hebrews, chapter 10, verse 31. He read: \\"It is a fearful thing to fall into the hands of the living God.\\"He read it and threw the book aside. He even began trembling all over.\\"A fearful verse,\\" he said. \\"You picked a good one, I must say.","Pentru mine nu exista o idee superioara aceleia ca Dumnezeu nu exista.

We\'ll extinguish desire: we\'ll get drinking, gossip, denunciation going; we\'ll get unheard-of depravity going; we\'ll stifle every genius in infancy. Everything reduced to a common denominator, complete equality. \'We\'ve learned a trade, and we\'re honest people, we don\'t need anything else\'--that was the recent response of the English workers. Only the necessary is necessary--henceforth that is the motto of the whole globe. But there is also a need for convulsion; this will be taken care of by us, the rulers. Slaves must have rulers. Complete obedience, complete impersonality, but once every thirty years Shigalyov gets a convulsion going, and they all suddenly start devouring each other, up to a certain point, simply so as not to be bored. Boredom is an aristocratic sensation; in Shigalyovism there will be no desires. Desire and suffering are for us.","You\'re Sappho, I\'m Phaon, agreed.But there\'s one thing still troubling me:You don\'t know your way to the sea.","Our historical pastime is the direct satisfaction of inflicting pain. There are lines in Nekrassov describing how a peasant lashes a horse on the eyes, \'on its meek eyes,\' everyone must have seen it. It\'s peculiarly Russian. He describes how a feeble little nag has foundered under too heavy a load and cannot move. The peasant beats it, beats it savagely, beats it at last not knowing what he is doing in the intoxication of cruelty, thrashes it mercilessly over and over again. \'However weak you are, you must pull, if you die for it.\' The nag strains, and then he begins lashing the poor defenceless creature on its weeping, on its \'meek eyes.\' The frantic beast tugs and draws the load, trembling all over, gasping for breath, moving sideways, with a sort of unnatural spasmodic action- it\'s awful in Nekrassov. But that only a horse, and God has horses to be beaten.","Two times two is four is no longer life, gentlemen, but the beginning of death.","\u064a\u062c\u0628 \u0627\u0646 \u062a\u0639\u0627\u0645\u0644 \u0627\u0643\u062b\u0631 \u0627\u0644\u0646\u0627\u0633 .. \u0645\u0639\u0627\u0645\u0644\u062a\u0643 \u0627\u0637\u0641\u0627\u0644\u0627 \u060c \u0648\u0627\u0646 \u062a\u0639\u0627\u0645\u0644 \u0628\u0639\u0636 \u0627\u0644\u0646\u0627\u0633 .. \u0645\u0639\u0627\u0645\u0644\u062a\u0643 \u0645\u0631\u0636\u0649","If there is no immortality of the soul, then there is no virtue, and therefore everything is permitted.","Convictions and the man--it seems they\'re two different things in many ways.

I\'ve collected a great, great deal about Russian children, Alyosha. There was a little girl of five who was hated by her father and mother, \'most worthy and respectable people, of good education and breeding.\' You see, I must repeat again, it is a peculiar characteristic of many people, this love of torturing children, and children only. To all other types of humanity these torturers behave mildly and benevolently, like cultivated and humane Europeans; but they are very fond of tormenting children, even fond of children themselves in that sense. it\'s just their defencelessness that tempts the tormentor, just the angelic confidence of the child who has no refuge and no appeal, that sets his vile blood on fire. In every man, of course, a demon lies hidden- the demon of rage, the demon of lustful heat at the screams of the tortured victim, the demon of lawlessness let off the chain, the demon of diseases that follow on vice, gout, kidney disease, and so on.\\"This poor child of five was subjected to every possible torture by those cultivated parents. They beat her, thrashed her, kicked her for no reason till her body was one bruise. Then, they went to greater refinements of cruelty- shut her up all night in the cold and frost in a privy, and because she didn\'t ask to be taken up at night (as though a child of five sleeping its angelic, sound sleep could be trained to wake and ask), they smeared her face and filled her mouth with excrement, and it was her mother, her mother did this. And that mother could sleep, hearing the poor child\'s groans! Can you understand why a little creature, who can\'t even understand what\'s done to her, should beat her little aching heart with her tiny fist in the dark and the cold, and weep her meek unresentful tears to dear, kind God to protect her? Do you understand that, friend and brother, you pious and humble novice? Do you understand why this infamy must be and is permitted? Without it, I am told, man could not have existed on earth, for he could not have known good and evil. Why should he know that diabolical good and evil when it costs so much? Why, the whole world of knowledge is not worth that child\'s prayer to dear, kind God\'! I say nothing of the sufferings of grown-up people, they have eaten the apple, damn them, and the devil take them all! But these little ones! I am making you suffer, Alyosha, you are not yourself.

This creed is extremely simple; here it is: I believe that there is nothing lovelier, deeper, more sympathetic, more rational, more manly, and more perfect than the Saviour; I say to myself with jealous love that not only is there no one else like Him, but that there could be no one. I would even say more: If anyone could prove to me that Christ is outside the truth, and if the truth really did exclude Christ, I should prefer to stay with Christ and not with truth. I would rather not say anything more about it. And yet I don\'t know why certain topics may never be touched on in society, and why, if anyone does introduce them, it makes the others uncomfortable. Still, enough of it. I heard that you were desirous of travelling somewhere in the South. God grant that you may succeed in obtaining permission to do so. But will you please tell me when we shall be quite free, or at any rate as free as other people ? Perhaps only when we no longer need freedom ? For my part, I want all or nothing. In my soldier\'s uniform I am the same prisoner as before. I rejoice greatly that I find there is patience in my soul for quite a long time yet, that I desire no earthly possessions, and need nothing but books, the possibility of writing, and of being daily for a few hours alone. The last troubles me most. For almost five years I have been constantly under surveillance, or with several other people, and not one hour alone with myself. To be alone is a natural need, like eating and drinking ; for in that kind of concentrated communism one becomes a whole-hearted enemy of mankind. The constant companionship of others works like poison or plague; and from that unendurable martyrdom I most suffered in the last four years. There were moments in which I hated every man, whether good or evil, and regarded him as a thief who, unpunished, was robbing me of life. The most unbearable part is when one grows unjust, malignant, and evil, is aware of it, even reproves one\'s-self, and yet has not the power to control one\'s-self. I have experienced that. I am convinced that God will keep you from it. I believe that you, as a woman, have more power to forgive and to endure.

For the world says: \u201cYou have desires and so satisfy them, for you have the same rights as the most rich and powerful. Don\u2019t be afraid of satisfying them and even multiply your desires. That is the modern doctrine of the world. In that they see freedom. And what follows from this right of multiplication of desires? In the rich, isolation and spiritual suicide; in the poor, envy and murder; for they have been given rights, but have not been shown the means of satisfying their wants.

For who would want to choose by rule? Besides, he will at once be transformed from a human being into an organ stop or something of the sort; for what is a man without desire, without free will and without choice, if not a stop in an organ?

But the main feature was that this was all in me not as if by chance, but as if it had to be so. As if it were my most normal condition and in no way a sickness or a blight, so that finally I lost any wish to struggle against this blight. I ended up almost believing (and maybe indeed believing) that this perhaps was my normal condition. But at first, in the beginning, how much torment I endured in this struggle! I did not believe that such things happened to others, and therefore kept it to myself all my life as a secret. I was ashamed (maybe I am ashamed even now); it reached the point with me where I would feel some secret, abnormal, mean little pleasure in returning to my corner on some nasty Petersburg night and being highly conscious of having once again done a nasty thing that day, and again that what had been done could in no way be undone, and I would gnaw, gnaw at myself with my teeth, inwardly, secretly, tear and suck at myself until the bitterness finally turned into some shameful, accursed sweetness, and finally-into a decided, serious pleasure! Yes, a pleasure, a pleasure! I stand upon it. The reason I\'ve begun to speak is that I keep wanting to find out for certain: do other people have such pleasures? I\'ll explain it to you: the pleasure here lay precisely in the too vivid consciousness of one\'s own humiliation; in feeling that one had reached the ultimate wall; that, bad as it is, it cannot be otherwise; that there is no way out for you, that you will never change into a different person; that even if you had enough time and enough faith left to change yourself into something different, you probably would not wish to change; and even if you did wish it, you would still not do anything, because in fact there is perhaps nothing to change into.","Maybe I\'m not so good as I seem to you.

And that\'s why I declare that I accept God plainly and simply. But there\'s this that has to be said: if God really exists and if he really has created the world, then, as we all know, he created it in accordance with the Euclidean geometry, and he created the human mind with the conception of only the three dimensions of space. And yet there have been and there still are mathematicians and philosophers, some of them indeed men of extraordinary genius, who doubt whether the whole universe, or, to put it more wildly, all existence was created only according to Euclidean geometry and they even dare to dream that two parallel lines which, according to Euclid can never meet on earth, may meet somewhere in infinity. I, my dear chap, have come to the conclusion that if I can\'t understand even that, then how can I be expected to understand about God? I humbly admit that I have no abilities for settling such questions. And I advise you too, Aloysha, my friend, never to think about it, and least of all about whether there is a God or not.

That\u2019s why they so dislike the living process of life; they don\u2019t want a living soul! The living soul demands life, the soul won\u2019t obey the rules of mechanics, the soul is an object of suspicion, the soul is retrograde! But what they want though it smells of death and can be made of India-rubber, at least is not alive, has no will, is servile and won\u2019t revolt!

And she died and did not leave a single good deed behind. The devils caught her and plunged her into the lake of fire. So her guardian angel stood and wondered what good deed of hers he could remember to tell to God; \'She once pulled up an onion in her garden,\' said he, \'and gave it to a beggar woman.\' And God answered: \'You take that onion then, hold it out to her in the lake, and let her take hold and be pulled out. And if you can pull her out of the lake, let her come to Paradise, but if the onion breaks, then the woman must stay where she is.\' The angel ran to the woman and held out the onion to her. \'Come,\' said he, \'catch hold and I\'ll pull you out.\' he began cautiously pulling her out. He had just pulled her right out, when the other sinners in the lake, seeing how she was being drawn out, began catching hold of her so as to be pulled out with her. But she was a very wicked woman and she began kicking them. \'I\'m to be pulled out, not you. It\'s my onion, not yours.\' As soon as she said that, the onion broke. And the woman fell into the lake and she is burning there to this day. So the angel wept and went away.","They retained only the faintest recollection of what they had lost and had no desire to believe that they had once been innocent and happy.

However, had it ever become possible for them to return to the state of happy innocence they had lost, and if someone could have shown it to them again and asked if they wanted to return to it, they would certainly have refused.","\u2026[\u043e\u043d] \u0441\u043f\u0440\u043e\u0441\u0438\u043b \u0441 \u0442\u043e\u044e \u043d\u0435\u0434\u0435\u043b\u0438\u043a\u0430\u0442\u043d\u043e\u044e \u0443\u0441\u043c\u0435\u0448\u043a\u043e\u0439, \u0432 \u043a\u043e\u0442\u043e\u0440\u043e\u0439 \u0442\u0430\u043a \u0431\u0435\u0441\u0446\u0435\u0440\u0435\u043c\u043e\u043d\u043d\u043e \u0438 \u043d\u0435\u0431\u0440\u0435\u0436\u043d\u043e \u0432\u044b\u0440\u0430\u0436\u0430\u0435\u0442\u0441\u044f \u0438\u043d\u043e\u0433\u0434\u0430 \u043b\u044e\u0434\u0441\u043a\u043e\u0435 \u0443\u0434\u043e\u0432\u043e\u043b\u044c\u0441\u0442\u0432\u0438\u0435 \u043f\u0440\u0438 \u043d\u0435\u0443\u0434\u0430\u0447\u0430\u0445 \u0431\u043b\u0438\u0436\u043d\u0435\u0433\u043e\u2026","How can you live, with such a hell in your heart and in your head?","\u015eairli\u011fimiz bo\u015fa de\u011fil, \xf6mr\xfcm\xfcz\xfc mum gibi iki ucundan bo\u015funa yakmad\u0131k.","En la pobreza, uno conserva la nobleza de sus sentimientos innatos; en la indigencia, nadie puede conservar nada noble.

Invece, nel quadro di Rogo\u017ein, si vede il cadavere di un uomo che \xe8 stato straziato prima di essere crocifisso, un uomo percosso dalle guardie e dalla folla, che \xe8 stramazzato sotto il peso della croce e che ha sofferto per sei ore (secondo il mio calcolo) prima di morire. Il viso dipinto in quel quadro \xe8 proprio quello di un uomo appena tolto dalla croce; non \xe8 irrigidito dalla morte ma \xe8 ancora caldo e, starei per dire, vitale. La sua espressione \xe8 quella di chi sta ancora sentendo il dolore patito. Un viso di un realismo spietato. Io so che, secondo la Chiesa, fin dai primi secoli, Cristo, fattosi uomo, soffr\xec realmente come un uomo e che il suo corpo fu soggetto a tutte le leggi della natura. Il viso del quadro \xe8 gonfio e sanguinolento; gli occhi dilatati e vitrei. Ma, nel contemplarlo, si pensa: \xabSe gli Apostoli, le donne che stavano presso la croce, i fedeli, gli adoratori e tutti gli altri videro il corpo di Cristo in quello stato, come potevano credere all\u2019imminente resurrezione? Se le leggi della natura sono cos\xec potenti, come farebbe l\u2019uomo a dominarle quando la loro prima vittima \xe8 stato proprio Colui che, da vivo, impartiva i suoi ordini alla stessa natura, Colui che disse: \u201cTalitha cumi!, e la bambina morta resuscit\xf2; Colui che esclam\xf2: \u201cAlzati e cammina!\u201d, e Lazzaro, che era gi\xe0 morto, usc\xec fuori dal suo sepolcro?\xbb. Guardando quel quadro, si \xe8 presi dall\u2019idea che la natura non sia altro che un mostro enorme, muto, inesorabile, una macchina immensa ma sorda e insensibile, capace di afferrare, lacerare, schiacciare e assorbire nelle sue viscere un Essere che, da solo, valeva come la natura intera con tutte le sue leggi e tutta la terra che, forse, fu creata solo perch\xe9 potesse nascere quell\u2019uomo! Il quadro d\xe0 proprio l\u2019impressione di questa forza cieca, crudele, stupida, alla quale tutto \xe8 fatalmente soggetto. Dentro di esso, non c\u2019\xe8 nessuno fra quelli che erano soliti seguire Ges\xf9. In quella sera, una sera che annientava tutte le loro speranze e forse anche tutta la loro fede, coloro che seguivano Ges\xf9 dovettero provare un\u2019angoscia senza nome. Atterriti, si dileguarono, sostenuti soltanto da una grande idea, un\u2019idea che nessuno avrebbe pi\xf9 potuto togliergli o canccllargli: se il Maestro, alla vigilia del supplizio, avesse potuto vedere la propria immagine, sarebbe salito lo stesso sulla croce? Sarebbe morto nel modo in cui mor\xec?\u201d","And if it is a mystery, then we, too, had the right to preach mystery and to teach them that it is not the free choice of the heart that matters, and not love, but the mystery, which they must blindly obey, even setting aside their own conscience. And so we did. We corrected your deed and based it on miracle, mystery, and authority. And mankind rejoiced that they were once more led like sheep, and that at last such a terrible gift, which had brought them so much suffering, had been taken from their hearts.","In the land of Uz, there lived a man, righteous and God-fearing, and he had great wealth, so many camels, so many sheep and asses, and his children feasted, and he loved them very much and prayed for them. \'It may be that my sons have sinned in their feasting.\' Now the devil came before the Lord together with the sons of God, and said to the Lord that he had gone up and down the earth and under the earth. \'And hast thou considered my servant Job?\' God asked of him. And God boasted to the devil, pointing to his great and holy servant. And the devil laughed at God\'s words. \'Give him over to me and Thou wilt see that Thy servant will murmur against Thee and curse Thy name.\' And God gave up the just man He loved so, to the devil. And the devil smote his children and his cattle and scattered his wealth, all of a sudden like a thunderbolt from heaven. And Job rent his mantel and fell down upon the ground and cried aloud, \'Naked came I out of my mother\'s womb, and naked shall I return into the earth; the Lord gave and the Lord has taken away. Blessed be the name of the Lord for ever and ever.\'Fathers and teachers, forgive my tears now, for all my childhood rises up again before me, and I breathe now as I breathed then, with the breast of a little child of eight, and I feel as I did then, awe and wonder and gladness. The camels at that time caught my imagination, and Satan, who talked like that with God, and God who gave His servant up to destruction, and His servant crying out: \'Blessed be Thy name although Thou dost punish me,\' and then the soft and sweet singing in the church: \'Let my prayer rise up before Thee,\' and again incense from the priest\'s censer and the kneeling and the prayer. Ever since then - only yesterday I took it up - I\'ve never been able to read that sacred tale without tears. And how much that is great, mysterious and unfathomable there is in it! Afterwards I heard the words of mockery and blame, proud words, \'How could God give up the most loved of His saints for the diversion of the devil, take from him his children, smite him with sore boils so that he cleansed the corruption from his sores with a pot-sherd - and for no object except to board to the devil! \'See what My saint can suffer for My Sake.\' \' But the greatness of it lies just in the fact that it is a mystery - that the passing earthly show and the eternal verity are brought together in it. In the face of the earthly truth, the eternal truth is accomplished. The Creator, just as on the first days of creation He ended each day with praise: \'That is good that I have created,\' looks upon Job and again praises His creation. And Job, praising the Lord, serves not only Him but all His creation for generations and generations, and for ever and ever, since for that he was ordained. Good heavens, what a book it is, and what lessons there are in it! What a book the Bible is, what a miracle, what strength is given with it to man! It is like a mold cast of the world and man and human nature, everything is there, and a law for everything for all the ages. And what mysteries are solved and revealed! God raises Job again, gives him wealth again. Many years pass by, and he has other children and loves them. But how could he love those new ones when those first children are no more, when he has lost them? Remembering them, how could he be fully happy with those new ones, however dear the new ones might be? But he could, he could. It\'s the great mystery of human life that old grief passes gradually into quiet, tender joy. The mild serenity of age takes the place of the riotous blood of youth. I bless the rising such each day, and, as before, my heart sings to meet it, but now I love even more its setting, its long slanting rays and the soft, tender, gentle memories that come with them, the dear images from the whole of my long, happy life - and over all the Divine Truth, softening, reconciling, forgiving!","\u0625\u0646\u0646\u064a \u0641\u064a \u0631\u0648\u062d \u062a\u0644\u0643 \u0627\u0644\u0645\u0631\u0623\u0629 \u0627\u0644\u062a\u064a \u062a\u0646\u0647\u0636 \u0645\u0646 \u0646\u0648\u0645\u0647\u0627 \u0644\u062a\u0628\u0643\u064a","I walked along Nevsky Avenue.Actually it was more torture, humiliation, and bilious irritation than a stroll...","But she forgot nothing, and he sometimes forgot much too quickly, and, often that same day, encouraged by her composure, would laugh and frolic over the champagne, if friends stopped by. What venom must have been in her eyes at those moments yet he noticed nothing!","You see gentlemen, there are ideas . . . that is, you see, when some ideas are said out loud, put into words, they come out terribly stupid. They come out so that you\'re ashamed of yourself. But why? For no reason at all.

The first preserve the world and people it, the second move the world and lead it to its goal.","[The Devil] \'The question now,\' my young thinker reflected, \'is whether or not it is possible for such a period ever to come. If it does come, then everything will be resolved and mankind will finally be settled. But since, in view of man\'s inveterate stupidity, it may not be settled for another thousand years, anyone who already knows the truth is permitted to settle things for himself, absolutely as he wishes, on the new principles. In this sense, \\"everything is permitted\\" to him. Moreover, since God and immortality do not exist in any case, even if this period should never come, the new man is allowed to become a man-god, though it be he alone in the whole world, and of course, in this new rank, to jump lightheartedly over any former moral obstacle of the former slave-man, if need be. There is no law for God! Where God stand--there is the place of God! Where I stand, there at once will be the foremost place...\\"everything is permitted,\\" and that\'s that!\' It\'s all very nice; only if one wants to swindle, why, I wonder, should one also need the sanction of truth? But such is the modern little Russian man: without such a sanction, he doesn\'t even dare to swindle, so much does he love the truth...","Had you accepted that third counsel of the mighty spirit, you would have furnished all that man seeks on earth, that is: someone to bow down to, someone to take over his conscience, and a means for uniting everyone at last into a common, concordant, and incontestable anthill - for the need for universal union is the third and last torment of men.","Another time, twice, in fact, I tried hard to be in love. I suffered, too, gentlemen, I assure you. In the depth of my heart there was no faith in my suffering, only a faint stir of mockery, but yet I did suffer, and in the real, orthodox way; I was jealous, beside myself... and it was all from ENNUI, gentlemen, all from ENNUI; inertia overcame me. You know the direct, legitimate fruit of consciousness is inertia, that is, conscious sitting-with-the-hands-folded. I have referred to this already. I repeat, I repeat with emphasis: all \u2018direct\u2019 persons and men of action are active just because they are stupid and limited. How explain that? I will tell you: in consequence of their limitation they take immediate and secondary causes for primary ones, and in that way persuade themselves more quickly and easily than other people do that they have found an infallible foundation for their activity, and their minds are at ease and you know that is the chief thing. To begin to act, you know, you must first have your mind completely at ease and no trace of doubt left in it. Why, how am I, for example, to set my mind at rest?

He felt that they were not analogous to the fantastic and unreal dreams due to intoxication by hashish, opium or wine. Of that he could judge, when the attack was over. These instants were characterized--to define it in a word--by an intense quickening of the sense of personality. Since, in the last conscious moment preceding the attack, he could say to himself, with full understanding of his words: \\"I would give my whole life for this one instant,\\" then doubtless to him it really was worth a lifetime. For the rest, he thought the dialectical part of his argument of little worth; he saw only too clearly that the result of these ecstatic moments was stupefaction, mental darkness, idiocy. No argument was possible on that point. His conclusion, his estimate of the \\"moment,\\" doubtless contained some error, yet the reality of the sensation troubled him. What\'s more unanswerable than a fact? And this fact had occurred.

If they declare that it is they who are advancing towards unity, only the most simple-hearted among them believe it, so that one may positively marvel at such simplicity. Of a truth, they have more fantastic dreams than we. They aim at justice, but, denying Christ, they will end by flooding the earth with blood, for blood cries out for blood, and he that taketh up the sword shall perish by the sword. And if it were not for Christ\'s covenant, they would slaughter one another down to the last two men on earth. And those two last men would not be able to restrain each other in their pride, and the one would slay the other and then himself. And that would come to pass, were it not for the promise of Christ that for the sake of the humble and meek the days shall be shortened.","All mankind in our age have split up into units, they all keep apart, each in his own groove; each one holds aloof, hides himself and hides what he has, from the rest, and he ends by being repelled by others and repelling them. He heaps up riches by himself and thinks, \u2018How strong I am now and how secure,\u2019 and in his madness he does not understand that the more he heaps up, the more he sinks into self-destructive impotence. For he is accustomed to rely upon himself alone and to cut himself off from the whole; he has trained himself not to believe in the help of others, in men and in humanity, and only trembles for fear he should lose his money and the privileges that he has won for himself. Everywhere in these days men have, in their mockery, ceased to understand that the true security is to be found in social solidarity rather than in isolated individual effort.","Sometimes even if he has to do it alone, and his conduct seems to be crazy, a man must set an example, and so draw men\'s souls out of their solitude and spur them to some act of brotherly love, that the great idea may not die.","How thin she is in her coffin, how sharp her nose has grown!

A strange thought: if only it were possible not to bury her? For if they take her away, then... oh, no, it is almost incredible that they take her away!

Whereas Christ\u2019s Church, having entered the state, no doubt could give up none of its own basic principles, of that rock on which it stood, and could pursue none but its own aims, once firmly established and shown to it by the Lord himself, among which was the transforming of the whole world, and therefore of the whole ancient pagan state, into the Church. Thus (that is, for future purposes), it is not the Church that should seek a definite place for itself in the state, like \u2018any social organization\u2019 or \u2018organization of men for religious purposes\u2019 (as the author I was objecting to refers to the Church), but, on the contrary, every earthly state must eventually be wholly transformed into the Church and become nothing else but the Church, rejecting whichever of its aims are incompatible with those of the Church. And all of this will in no way demean it, will take away neither its honor nor its glory as a great state, nor the glory of its rulers, but will only turn it from a false, still pagan and erroneous path, onto the right and true path that alone leads to eternal goals.","Christ, too, will forgive, if only you attain to forgiving yourself...Oh, no, no, do not believe that I have spoken a blasphemy: even if you do not attain to reconciliation with yourself and forgiveness of yourself, even then He will forgive you for your intention and for your great suffering.","You must know that there is nothing higher and stronger and more wholesome and good for life in the future than some good memory, especially a memory of childhood, of home.","Moreover, in order to understand any man one must be deliberate and careful to avoid forming prejudices and mistaken ideas, which are very difficult to correct and get over afterwards.","Era una notte meravigliosa, una notte come ce ne possono essere soltanto quando si \xe8 giovani, caro lettore.

Sometimes I went and climbed the mountain and stood there in the midst of the tall pines, all alone in the terrible silence, with our little village in the distance, and the sky so blue, and the sun so bright, and an old ruined castle on the mountain-side, far away. I used to watch the line where earth and sky met, and longed to go and seek there the key of all mysteries, thinking that I might find there a new life, perhaps some great city where life should be grander and richer--and then it struck me that life may be grand enough even in a prison.","Ascoltate, perch\xe8 non siamo tutti come fratelli gli uni per gli altri?

A special feature of this physiognomy was its death-like pallor, which gave to the whole man an indescribably emaciated appearance in spite of his hard look, and at the same time a sort of passionate and suffering expression which did not harmonize with his impudent, sarcastic smile and keen, self-satisfied bearing. He wore a large fur\u2014or rather astrachan\u2014overcoat, which had kept him warm all night, while his neighbour had been obliged to bear the full severity of a Russian November night entirely unprepared.

I am not a professional writer and don\'t want to be, and to drag forth into the literary market-place the inmost secrets of my soul and an artistic description of my feelings I should regard as indecent and contemptible.","And so it is that when we are unhappy we more strongly feel the unhappiness of others; feeling is not shattered but becomes concentrated...","Sufletul lui Othello era pur si simplu zdrobit si de aceea se dezechilibrase toata conceptia lui despre lume, pentru ca idealul lui era mort.","but the most sumptuous thing in the room at that moment was naturally the sumptuously laid table, though, of course, even that was comparatively speaking: the table-cloth was clean, the silver was brightly polished; three kinds of wonderfully baked bread, two bottles of wine, two bottles of excellent monastery mead, and a large glass jug of monastery kvas, famous throughout the neighbourhood. There was no vodka at all. Rakitin related afterwards that this time it was a five-course dinner: fish soup of sterlets served with fish patties; then boiled fish excellently prepared in a special way; then salmon cutlets, ice cream and stewed fruits and, finally, a fruit jelly.","Your money or your life!","in order to understand any man one must be deliberate and careful to avoid forming prejudices and mistaken ideas, which are very difficult to correct and get over afterwards.

Once, in the infinity of existence unmeasurable by time or space, a spiritual creature, upon its appearance on earth, is given the power to say: \\"I am and I love.\\" Once, and only for a moment, is that creature given the knowledge of active, living love, and this is why that creature was given life on earth, and with it, time and space. And what happens? The privileged creature rejects that priceless gift, fails to appreciate it, does not even like it, sneers at it, and remains unmoved. When such a creature leaves the earth, sees Abraham, and talks with him as in the parable about Lazarus and the rich man--when he is already in sight of heaven and is allowed into the presence of the Lord, he is filled with suffering at the thought that he will appear before the Lord never having loved and will be brought into the presence of those who have loved him but whose love he has scorned. For now he sees clearly and says to himself: \\"I now have the knowledge and I am yearning for love; but now that my earthly life is over, there can be no self-abnegation, no sacrifice in love, and Abraham will not come to me again and bring me even a tiny drop of living water (that is, the gift of life on earth, the active life which I possessed before); since I will never again be given life and time, I will never be able to quench the fiery thirst for love that burns within me, because I scorned love while I was on earth. I would be glad to give my life for the love of others, but it is too late now because I no longer have the life to sacrifice, and there is a chasm between that life and this existence.","Gentleman, we\'re all cruel, we\'re all monsters, we all make men weep and mothers, and babes at the breast, but of all, let it be settled here, now, of all I am the lowest reptile!

Be aware of your dishonesty and ponder it every hour, every minute of the day. Never be squeamish, both with regard to yourself and others; what appears to you disgusting in yourself is cleansed by the very fact that you have acknowledged it within yourself. Avoid giving in to fear too, since all fear is only the consequence of falsity. Never be afraid of your own faint-heartedness in the endeavour to love, nor even too fearful of any bad actions that you may commit in the course of that endeavour. I am sorry I cannot say anything more comforting to you, for active love compared with contemplative love is a hard and awesome business. Contemplative love seeks a heroic deed that can be accomplished without delay and in full view of everyone. Indeed, some people are even ready to lay down their lives as long as the process is not long drawn out but takes place quickly, as though it were being staged for everybody to watch and applaud. Active love, on the other hand, is unremitting hard work and tenacity, and for some it is a veritable science. But let me tell you in advance: even as you may realize with horror that, in spite of your best efforts, not only have you not come any nearer to your goal, but you may even have receded from it, it is precisely at that moment, I tell you, that you will suddenly reach your goal and clearly behold the wondrous power of God, who has at all times loved you, at all times mysteriously guided you.

For he has become accustomed to relying upon himself alone has isolated himself from the whole as an individual, has trained his soul not to trust in help from others, in human beings and mankind, and is fearful only of losing his money and privileges he has acquired. In every place today the human mind is mockingly starting to lose its awareness of the fact that a person\'s true security consists not in his own personal, solitary effort, but in the common integrity of human kind.","\u0623\u0644\u0627 \u0625\u0646 \u0627\u0644\u0633\u0639\u062f\u0627\u0621 \u0644\u0627 \u064a\u0637\u0627\u0642\u0648\u0646 \u0648\u0644\u0627 \u064a\u062d\u062a\u0645\u0644\u0648\u0646 ! \u0648\u0644\u0643\u0646\u0646\u064a \u0644\u0627 \u0623\u0633\u062a\u0637\u064a\u0639 \u0623\u0646 \u0623\u0632\u0639\u0644","At times, with an intense, acute pang I was stabbed to the heart by the thought that ten years, twenty years, forty years would pass, and that even in forty years I would remember with loathing and humiliation those filthiest, most ludicrous, and most awful moments of my life.","But that is what the scoffers don\u2019t understand: \u201cHehad a dream, they say, \u201ca delirium, a hallucination.\u201d Eh!

One man who had been in Siberia told me that he himself had witnessed how the most hardened criminals remembered the general, and yet the general, when he visited the gangs of convicts, was rarely able to give more than twenty copecks to each man.

But how many moves are here, and how much is there that is unknown to us? In sowing your seed, sowing your \u2018charity\u2019, your good deeds in whatever form, you give away a part of your personality and absorb part of another; a little more attention, and you are rewarded with knowledge, with the most unexpected discoveries. You will, at last, certainly view your deeds as a science; they will take over the whole of your life and may fill it. On the other hand, all your thoughts, all the seeds you have sown, which perhaps you have already forgotten, will take root and grow; the one who has received from you will give to another.

What ought to horrify us is that we are so accustomed to it, and not this or that isolated crime. What are the causes of our indifference, our lukewarm attitude to such deeds, to such signs of the times, ominous of an unenviable future? Is it our cynicism, is it the premature exhaustion of intellect and imagination in a society that is sinking into decay, in spite of its youth? Is it that our moral principles are shattered to their foundations, or is it, perhaps, a complete lack of such principles among us?","But the church, like a tender, loving mother holds aloof from active punishment herself, as the sinner is too severely punished already by the civil law, and there must be at least someone to have pity on him.

Why, to tell long stories, showing how I have spoiled my life through morally rotting in my corner, through lack of fitting environment, through divorce from real life, and rankling spite in my underground world, would certainly not be interesting; a novel needs a hero, and all the traits for an anti-hero are EXPRESSLY gathered together here, and what matters most, it all produces an unpleasant impression, for we are all divorced from life, we are all cripples, every one of us, more or less. We are so divorced from it that we feel at once a sort of loathing for real life, and so cannot bear to be reminded of it. Why, we have come almost to looking upon real life as an effort, almost as hard work, and we are all privately agreed that it is better in books.","He wasn\'t thinking about anything.

But at the same time he knew now and knew for certain that, although it filled her with dread and suffering, yet she had a tormenting desire to read and to read to him that he might hear it, and to read now whatever might come of it! ...

No quarrelling, however, no quarrelling! Possibly if some one wanted, if some one, for instance, actually insisted on turning Mr. Golyadkin into a rag, he might have done so, might have done so without opposition or punishment (Mr. Golyadkin was himself conscious of this at times), and he would have been a rag and not Golyadkin - yes, a nasty, filthy rag; but that rag would not have been a simple rag, it would have been a rag possessed of dignity, it would have been a rag possessed of feelings and sentiments, even though dignity was defenceless and feelings could not assert themselves, and lay hidden deep down in the filthy folds of the rag, still the feelings there...","He came softly, unobserved, and yet, strange to say, every one recognized Him. That might be one of the best passages in the poem. I mean, why they recognized Him. The people are irresistibly drawn to Him, they surround Him, they flock about Him, follow Him. He moves silently in their midst with a gentle smile of infinite compassion. The sun of love burns in His heart, light and power shine from His eyes, and their radiance, shed on the people, stirs their hearts with responsive love. He holds out His hands to them, blesses them, and a healing virtue comes from contact with Him, even with His garments. An old man in the crowd, blind from childhood, cries out, \u2018O Lord, heal me and I shall see Thee!\u2019 and, as it were, scales fall from his eyes and the blind man sees Him. The crowd weeps and kisses the earth under His feet. Children throw flowers before Him, sing, and cry hosannah. \u2018It is He\u2014it is He!\u2019 all repeat. \u2018It must be He, it can be no one but Him!\u2019 He stops at the steps of the Seville cathedral at the moment when the weeping mourners are bringing in a little open white coffin. In it lies a child of seven, the only daughter of a prominent citizen. The dead child lies hidden in flowers. \u2018He will raise your child,\u2019 the crowd shouts to the weeping mother. The priest, coming to meet the coffin, looks perplexed, and frowns, but the mother of the dead child throws herself at His feet with a wail. \u2018If it is Thou, raise my child!\u2019 she cries, holding out her hands to Him. The procession halts, the coffin is laid on the steps at His feet. He looks with compassion, and His lips once more softly pronounce, \u2018Maiden, arise!\u2019 and the maiden arises.

Now we do think bloodshed abominable and yet we engage in this abomination, and with more energy than ever.","But in some cases it is really more creditable to be carried away by an emotion, however unreasonable, which springs from a great love, than to be unmoved.","As a general rule, people, even the wicked, are much more naive and simple-hearted than we suppose.

I was considering how to begin. It was twilight in the room, a blackstorm\u2212cloud was coming over the sky, and there came again a rumble of thunder in the distance.","I will explain; the enjoyment was just from the too intense consciousness of one\u2019s own degradation; it was from feeling oneself that one had reached the last barrier, that it was horrible, but that it could not be otherwise; that there was no escape for you; that you never could become a different man; that even you did wish to, even then you would do nothing; because per- haps in reality there was nothing for you to change into.","Beside himself with shame and despair, the utterly ruined though perfectly just Mr. Golyadkin dashed headlong away, wherever fate might lead him; but with every step he took, with every thud of his foot on the granite of the pavement, there leapt up as though out of the earth a Mr. Golyadkin precisely the same, perfectly alike, and of a revolting depravity of heart. And all these precisely similar Golyadkins set to running after one another as soon as they appeared, and stretched in a long chain like a file of geese, hobbling after the real Mr. Golyadkin, so there was nowhere to escape from these duplicates \u2014 so that Mr. Golyadkin, who was in every way deserving of compassion, was breathless with terror; so that at last a terrible multitude of duplicates had sprung into being; so that the whole town was obstructed at last by duplicate Golyadkins, and the police officer, seeing such a breach of decorum, was obliged to seize all these duplicates by the collar and to put them into the watch-house, which happened to be beside him . . . Numb and chill with horror, our hero woke up, and numb and chill with horror felt that his waking state was hardly more cheerful . . . It was oppressive and harrowing . . . He was overcome by such anguish that it seemed as though some one were gnawing at his heart.","Then, oh, then a totally new life would begin at once! He dreamed of this other, this renewed and now \\"virtuous\\" life (\\"it must, it must be virtuous\\") ceaselessly and feverishly. He thirsted for this resurrection and renewal. The vile bog he had gotten stuck in of his own will burdened him too much, and, like a great many men in such cases, he believed most of all in a change of place: if only it weren\'t for these people, if only it weren\'t for these circumstances, if only one could fly away from this cursed place--then everything would be reborn!\\"\\"He had often felt anguish before, and it would be no wonder if it came at such a moment, when he was preparing, the very next day, having suddenly broken with everything that had drawn him there, to make another sharp turn, entering upon a new, completely unknown path, again quite as lonely as before, having much hope, but not knowing for what, expecting much, too much, from life, but unable himself to define anything either in his expectations or even in his desires.","... if i die what will become of them? ... What will become of them? ... Who would feed it and who would feed them all?","through the inscrutable decrees of Providence everything has its recompense, and a visible calamity sometimes brings with it a great, if invisible, profit.","So it is that when we are unhappy we sense more acutely the unhappiness of others; rather than dispersing, the emotion becomes focused...","Love one another, Fathers, said Father Zossima, as far as Alyosha could remember afterwards. \u201cLove God\'s people. Because we have come here and shut ourselves within these walls, we are no holier than those that are outside, but on the contrary, from the very fact of coming here, each of us has confessed to himself that he is worse than others, than all men on earth.... And the longer the monk lives in his seclusion, the more keenly he must recognize that. Else he would have had no reason to come here. When he realizes that he is not only worse than others, but that he is responsible to all men for all and everything, for all human sins, national and individual, only then the aim of our seclusion is attained. For know, dear ones, that every one of us is undoubtedly responsible for all men and everything on earth, not merely through the general sinfulness of creation, but each one personally for all mankind and every individual man. This knowledge is the crown of life for the monk and for every man. For monks are not a special sort of men, but only what all men ought to be. Only through that knowledge, our heart grows soft with infinite, universal, inexhaustible love. Then every one of you will have the power to win over the whole world by love and to wash away the sins of the world with your tears.... Each of you keep watch over your heart and confess your sins to yourself unceasingly. Be not afraid of your sins, even when perceiving them, if only there be penitence, but make no conditions with God. Again I say, Be not proud. Be proud neither to the little nor to the great. Hate not those who reject you, who insult you, who abuse and slander you. Hate not the atheists, the teachers of evil, the materialists\u2014and I mean not only the good ones\u2014for there are many good ones among them, especially in our day\u2014hate not even the wicked ones.

For every one strives to keep his individuality as apart as possible, wishes to secure the greatest possible fullness of life for himself; but meantime all his efforts result not in attaining fullness of life but self-destruction, for instead of self-realization he ends by arriving at complete solitude. All mankind in our age have split up into units, they all keep apart, each in his own groove; each one holds aloof, hides himself and hides what he has, from the rest, and he ends by being repelled by others and repelling them. He heaps up riches by himself and thinks, \u2018How strong I am now and how secure,\u2019 and in his madness he does not understand that the more he heaps up, the more he sinks into self-destructive impotence. For he is accustomed to rely upon himself alone and to cut himself off from the whole; he has trained himself not to believe in the help of others, in men and in humanity, and only trembles for fear he should lose his money and the privileges that he has won for himself. Everywhere in these days men have, in their mockery, ceased to understand that the true security is to be found in social solidarity rather than in isolated individual effort. But this terrible individualism must inevitably have an end, and all will suddenly understand how unnaturally they are separated from one another. It will be the spirit of the time, and people will marvel that they have sat so long in darkness without seeing the light. And then the sign of the Son of Man will be seen in the heavens.... But, until then, we must keep the banner flying. Sometimes even if he has to do it alone, and his conduct seems to be crazy, a man must set an example, and so draw men\'s souls out of their solitude, and spur them to some act of brotherly love, that the great idea may not die.","How can I forgive his tormentors?\u2019 she bids all the saints, all the martyrs, all the angels and archangels to fall down together with her and plead for the pardon of all without discrimination.","He was hopelessly in debt to his landlady, and was afraid of meeting her.","This pleasure came precisely from being too clearly aware of your own degradation; from the feeling of having gone to the uttermost limits; that it is was vile, bit it could not have been otherwise; that you could not escape, you could never make yourself into a different person","I did dream of it, chiefly because \'all things are lawful.\' That was quite right what you taught me, for you talked a lot to me about that.

I agree totally that it really is mathematics. But I repeat to you for the hundredth time: there is only one case, only one, when a man can intentionally and consciously desire for himself even what is harmful and stupid, even what is extremely stupid: namely, in order to have the right to desire for himself even what is extremely stupid and not be constrained by the obligation to desire for himself only what is intelligent.","For men are made for happiness, and any one who is completely happy has a right to say to himself, \'I am doing God\'s will on earth.","proofs are no help to believing, especially material proofs.

Five minutes or more passed.","To be a human being among people and to remain one forever, no matter in what circumstances, not to grow despondent and not to lose heart \u2014 that\u2019s what life is all about, that\u2019s its task.","He was one of those idealistic Russian beings who are suddenly struck by some powerful idea and immediately, then and there, seem to be crushed by it, even sometimes permanently.

For the present I will only say that this \\"landowner\\"- for so we used to call him, although he hardly spent a day of his life on his own estate- was a strange type, yet one pretty frequently to be met with, a type abject and vicious and at the same time senseless. But he was one of those senseless persons who are very well capable of looking after their worldly affairs, and, apparently, after nothing else. Fyodor Pavlovitch, for instance, began with next to nothing; his estate was of the smallest; he ran to dine at other men\'s tables, and fastened on them as a toady, yet at his death it appeared that he had a hundred thousand roubles in hard cash. At the same time, he was all his life one of the most senseless, fantastical fellows in the whole district. I repeat, it was not stupidity- the majority of these fantastical fellows are shrewd and intelligent enough- but just senselessness, and a peculiar national form of it.","These educated parents subjected the poor five-year old girl to every possible torture. They beat her, flogged her, kicked her, not knowing why themselves, until her whole body was nothing but bruises; finally they attained the height of finesse: in the freezing cold, they locked her all night in the outhouse, because she wouldn\'t ask to get up and go in the middle of the night (as if a five-year-old child sleeping its sound angelic sleep could have learned to ask by that age)--for that they smeared her face with her excrement and made her eat the excrement, and it was her mother, her mother who made her! And this mother could sleep while her poor little child was moaning all night in that vile place! Can you understand that a small creature, who cannot even comprehend what is being done to her, in a vile place, in the dark and the cold, beats herself on her strained little chest with her tiny fist and weeps with her anguished, gentle, meek tears for \'dear God\' to protect her--can you understand such nonsense, my friend and my brother, my godly and humble novice, can you understand why this nonsense is needed and created? Without it, they say, man could not even have lived on earth, for he would not have known good and evil. Who wants to know this damned good and evil at such a price? The whole world of knowledge is not worth the tears of that little child to \'dear God.\' I\'m not talking about the suffering of grown-ups, they ate the apple and to hell with them, let the devil take them all, but these little ones!","That\'s good,\' she said, \'you go on like that, reading books. I\'ll make you a list myself of the books you ought to read first\u2014shall I?","I really feel obliged to go to this confounded luncheon.","Outwardly it\'s the truth, but inwardly, a lie!","The worst of such stories is that the triumphant romancers can always be put to confusion and crushed by the very details in which real life is so rich and which these unhappy and involuntary story-tellers neglect as insignificant trifles. Oh, they have no thought to spare for such details, their minds are concentrated on their grand invention as a whole, and fancy any one daring to pull them up for a trifle! But that\'s how they are caught.","We are all to blame, we are all to blame \u2026 and if only all were convinced of it!","That \'creature,\' that \'woman of loose behaviour\' is perhaps holier than you are yourselves, you monks who are seeking salvation! She fell perhaps in her youth, ruined by her environment. But she loved much and Christ himself forgave the woman \'who loved much.","As soon as some of our young ladies cut their hair, put on blue spectacles, and called themselves nihilists, they became convinced at once that, having put on the spectacles, they immediately began to have their own \u201cconvictions.","I love to hear singing to a street organ, said Raskolnikov, and his manner seemed strangely out of keeping with the subject\u2014\u201cI like it on cold, dark, damp autumn evenings\u2014they must be damp\u2014when all the passers-by have pale green, sickly faces, or better still when wet snow is falling straight down, when there\u2019s no wind\u2014you know what I mean? and the street lamps shine through it \u2026.\u201d","In short, one may say anything about the history of the world--anything that might enter the most disordered imagination.

Because we have come here and shut ourselves within these walls, we are no holier than those that are outside, but on the contrary, from the very fact of coming here, each of us has confessed to himself that he is worse than others, than all men on earth.... And the longer the monk lives in his seclusion, the more keenly he must recognise that. Else he would have had no reason to come here. When he realises that he is not only worse than others, but that he is responsible to all men for all and everything, for all human sins, national and individual, only then the aim of our seclusion is attained. For know, dear ones, that every one of us is undoubtedly responsible for all men \u2014 and everythingon earth, not merely through the general sinfulness of creation, but each one personally for all mankind andevery individual man. This knowledge is the crown of life for the monk and for every man. For monks are not a special sort of men, but only what all men ought to be. Only through that knowledge, our heart grows soft with infinite, universal, inexhaustible love. Then every one of you will have the power to win over the whole world by love and to wash away the sins of the world with your tears....Each of you keep watch over your heart and confess your sins to yourself unceasingly. Be not afraid of your sins, even when perceiving them, if only there be penitence, but make no conditions with God. Again, I say, be not proud. Be proud neither to the little nor to the great. Hate not those who reject you, who insult you, who abuse and slander you. Hate not the atheists, the teachers of evil, the materialists \u2014 and I mean not only the good ones \u2014 for there are many good ones among them, especially in our day \u2014 hate not even the wicked ones. Remember them in your prayers thus: Save, O Lord, all those who have none to pray for them, save too all those who will not pray. And add: it is not in pride that I make this prayer, O Lord, for I am lower than all men....Love God\u2019s people, let not strangers draw away the flock, for if you slumber in your slothfulness and disdainful pride, or worse still, in covetousness, they will come from all sides and draw away your flock. Expound the Gospel to the people unceasingly... be not extortionate.... Do not love gold and silver, do not hoard them.... Have faith. Cling to the banner and raise it on high.","You can be quite sure that all who cease to understand their own people and lose their ties with them, immediately and to the same extent, also lose the faith of their fathers, and either become atheists or indifferent.","So it is that we are unhappy we sense more acutely the unhappiness of others; rather than dispersing, the emotion becomes focused...","I did not bow down to you, I bowed down to all the suffering of humanity,","\u2026\u043e\u0447\u0435\u043d\u044c \u0447\u0430\u0441\u0442\u043e \u0442\u043e\u043b\u044c\u043a\u043e \u0442\u0430\u043a \u043a\u0430\u0436\u0435\u0442\u0441\u044f, \u0447\u0442\u043e \u043d\u0435\u0442 \u0442\u043e\u0447\u0435\u043a \u043e\u0431\u0449\u0438\u0445, \u0430 \u043e\u043d\u0438 \u043e\u0447\u0435\u043d\u044c \u0435\u0441\u0442\u044c\u2026 \u044d\u0442\u043e \u043e\u0442 \u043b\u0435\u043d\u043e\u0441\u0442\u0438 \u043b\u044e\u0434\u0441\u043a\u043e\u0439 \u043f\u0440\u043e\u0438\u0441\u0445\u043e\u0434\u0438\u0442, \u0447\u0442\u043e \u043b\u044e\u0434\u0438 \u0442\u0430\u043a \u043f\u0440\u043e\u043c\u0435\u0436 \u0441\u043e\u0431\u043e\u0439 \u043d\u0430 \u0433\u043b\u0430\u0437 \u0441\u043e\u0440\u0442\u0438\u0440\u0443\u044e\u0442\u0441\u044f \u0438 \u043d\u0438\u0447\u0435\u0433\u043e \u043d\u0435 \u043c\u043e\u0433\u0443\u0442 \u043d\u0430\u0439\u0442\u0438\u2026","\u0421\u0435\u0431\u044f, \u0441\u0432\u043e\u0439 \u043f\u043e\u043a\u043e\u0439 \u0438 \u043a\u043e\u043c\u0444\u043e\u0440\u0442 \u043e\u043d \u043b\u044e\u0431\u0438\u043b \u0438 \u0446\u0435\u043d\u0438\u043b \u0431\u043e\u043b\u0435\u0435 \u0432\u0441\u0435\u0433\u043e \u043d\u0430 \u0441\u0432\u0435\u0442\u0435, \u043a\u0430\u043a \u0438 \u0441\u043b\u0435\u0434\u043e\u0432\u0430\u043b\u043e \u0432 \u0432\u044b\u0441\u0448\u0435\u0439 \u0441\u0442\u0435\u043f\u0435\u043d\u0438 \u043f\u043e\u0440\u044f\u0434\u043e\u0447\u043d\u043e\u043c\u0443 \u0447\u0435\u043b\u043e\u0432\u0435\u043a\u0443.","And then it seemed to me that even in prison one might discover an immense life.","Every minute, every instant of life ought to be a blessing to man .\xa0.\xa0. they ought to be, they certainly ought to be!

This confusion became more and more intense. As he went down the stairs, he even stopped short, two or three times, as though suddenly struck by some thought. When he was in the street he cried out, \\"Oh, God, how loathsome it all is! and can I, can I possibly\u2026 . No, it\'s nonsense, it\'s rubbish!\\" he added resolutely. \\"And how could such an atrocious thing come into my head? What filthy things my heart is capable of. Yes, filthy above all, disgusting, loathsome, loathsome!\u2014and for a whole month I\'ve been\u2026 .\\" But no words, no exclamations, could express his agitation. The feeling of intense repulsion, which had begun to oppress and torture his heart while he was on his way to the old woman, had by now reached such a pitch and had taken such a definite form that he did not know what to do with himself to escape from his wretchedness. He walked along the pavement like a drunken man, regardless of the passers-by, and jostling against them, and only came to his senses when he was in the next street. Looking round, he noticed that he was standing close to a tavern which was entered by steps leading from the pavement to the basement. At that instant two drunken men came out at the door, and abusing and supporting one another, they mounted the steps. Without stopping to think, Raskolnikov went down the steps at once. Till that moment he had never been into a tavern, but now he felt giddy and was tormented by a burning thirst. He longed for a drink of cold beer, and attributed his sudden weakness to the want of food. He sat down at a sticky little table in a dark and dirty corner; ordered some beer, and eagerly drank off the first glassful. At once he felt easier; and his thoughts became clear.","I meant\u2026 I meant,\u2019 the prince began to tremble, \u2018I merely wanted to explain to Aglaya Ivanovna\u2026 to have the honour of explaining that I have never had the intention of\u2026 having the honour of asking for her hand\u2026 even some day\u2026 I\u2019m not to blame for this in any way, I swear to God, I\u2019m not to blame, Aglaya Ivanovna!

That was what he believed in and what he longed for.","But he did love people; he lived all his life, it seemed, with complete faith in people, and yet no one ever considered him either naive or a simpleton. There was something in him that told one, that convinced one (and it was so all his life afterwards) that he did not want to be a judge of men, that he would not take judgment upon himself and would not condemn anyone for anything. It seemed, even, that he accepted everything without the least condemnation, though often with deep sadness. Moreover, in this sense he even went so far that no one could either surprise or frighten him, and this even in his very early youth.","If anything is wrong with your nose, they send you to Paris: there, they say, is a European specialist who cures noses.

I had had a presentiment of this for a good long time, but complete conviction came swiftly during this last year. All of a sudden, I realized that it would not matter to me whether the world existed or whether there was nothing at all anywhere.

In fact, it happened at times that I thought more highly of them than of myself. It somehow happened quite suddenly that I alternated between despising them and thinking them superior to myself. A cultivated and decent man cannot be vain without setting a fearfully high standard for himself, and without despising and almost hating himself at certain moments. But whether I despised them or thought them superior I dropped my eyes almost every time I met anyone.

Tyranny is a habit. It can and does eventually develop into a disease. I believe that the best of men may grow coarse, degrade to the level of a beast by sheer force of habit. Blood and power intoxicate one, they develop callousness and lust. The greatest perversions grow finally acceptable and even delicious to mind and heart.

Because we have come here and shut ourselves within these walls, we are no holier than those that are outside, but on the contrary, from the very fact of coming here, each of us has confessed to himself that he is worse than others, than all men on earth... And the longer the monk lives in his seclusion, the more keenly he must recognize that. Else he would have had no reason to come here. When he realizes that he is not only worse than others, but that he is responsible to all men for all and everything, for all human sins, national and individual, only then the aim of our seclusion is attained. For know, dear ones, that every one of us is undoubtedly responsible for all men and everything on earth, not merely through the general sinfulness of creation, but each one personally for all mankind and every individual man. This knowledge is the crown of life for the monk and for every man. For monks are not a special sort of men, but only what all men ought to be. Only through that knowledge, our heart grows soft with infinite, universal, inexhaustible love. Then every one of you will have the power to win over the whole world by love and to wash away the sins of the world with your tears... Each of you keep watch over your heart and confess your sins to yourself unceasingly. Be not afraid of your sins, even when perceiving them, if only there be penitence, but make no conditions with God. Again I say, Be not proud. Be proud neither to the little nor to the great.

Hate not the atheists, the teachers of evil, the materialists\u2014and I mean not only the good ones\u2014for there are many good ones among them, especially in our day\u2014hate not even the wicked ones.

It is not miracles that dispose realists to belief. The genuine realist, if he is an unbeliever, will always find strength and ability to disbelieve in the miraculous, and if he is confronted with a miracle as an irrefutable fact he would rather disbelieve his own senses than admit the fact. Even if he admits it, he admits it as a fact of nature till then unrecognized by him. Faith does not, in the realist, spring from the miracle but the miracle from faith. If the realist once believes, then he is bound by his very realism to admit the miraculous also.","Here was an unparalleled thing, so that even from such an imperious and contemptuously proud girl as she was, such extremely frank testimony, such sacrifice, such self-immolation was almost impossible to expect.

Can there be a sin which could exceed the love of God? Think only of repentance, continual repentance, but dismiss fear altogether. Believe that God loves you as you cannot conceive; that He loves you with your sin, in your sin. It has been said of old that over one repentant sinner there is more joy in heaven than over ten righteous men. Go, and fear not. Be not bitter against men. Be not angry if you are wronged. Forgive the dead man in your heart what wrong he did you. Be reconciled with him in truth. If you are penitent, you love. And if you love you are of God. All things are atoned for, all things are saved by love. If I, a sinner, even as you are, am tender with you and have pity on you, how much more will God.

The answer is clear: to swallow human beings. How is one, in constructing the crocodile, to secure that he should swallow people? The answer is clearer still: construct him hollow.

Hence the inside of the crocodile must be hollow so that it may abhor the vacuum, and consequently swallow and so fill itself with anything it can come across. And that is the sole rational cause why every crocodile swallows men.

On all faces was written that they had only just discovered some highly important secret.","E intanto lo senti come attorno a te s\'agita e turbina la folla umana in un vortice vitale, lo senti e lo vedi come vive la gente, che sta fuori dal sogno, lo vedi che la vita loro non si volatilizza come un sogno, una visione, che la loro vita si rinnova sempre, \xe8 sempre giovane, e non c\'\xe8 un\'ora che sia simile all\'altra, laddove \xe8 cos\xec desolante e fino alla volgarit\xe0 ossessivamente paurosa la fantasia, schiava dell\'ombra, di un\'idea, schiava della prima nuvola che all\'improvviso vela il sole e stringe nell\'angoscia un vero animo pietroburghese, chetanto ha a cuore il proprio sole, - e nell\'angoscia altro che fantasia!

Answer: a sluggard. Why, it would have been very pleasant to hear that said about oneself. It would mean that I\u2019d been positively identified; it would mean that there was something to be said about me. \u201cA sluggard! Why, that\u2019s a calling and a vocation, a whole career!

This impressed them. Moreover, they all began by degrees to grasp that I had already read books none of them could read, and understood things (not forming part of our school curriculum) of which they had not even heard. They took a savage and sarcastic view of it, but were morally impressed, especially as the teachers began to notice me on those grounds. The mockery ceased, but the hostility remained, and cold and strained relations became permanent between us. In the end I could not put up with it: with years a craving for society, for friends, developed in me. I attempted to get on friendly terms with some of my schoolfellows; but somehow or other my intimacy with them was always strained and soon ended of itself.","Our choice is usually mistaken from a false view of our advantage.

Dostoevsky\'s works have had a profound and lasting effect on twentieth-century thought and world literature. Dostoevsky\'s chief ouevre, mainly novels, explore the human psychology in the disturbing political, social and spiritual context of his 19th-century Russian society. Considered by many as a founder or precursor of 20th-century existentialism, his Notes from Underground (1864), written in the anonymous, embittered voice of the Underground Man, is considered by Walter Kaufmann as the \\"best overture for existentialism ever written.\\" Source: Wikipedia","You know--a little rosy baby boy at your bosom, and what husband\'s heart is not touched, seeing his wife nursing his child! A plump little rosy baby, sprawling and snuggling, chubby little hands and feet, clean tiny little nails, so tiny that it makes one laugh to look at them; eyes that look as if they understand everything. And while it sucks it clutches at your bosom with its little hand, plays. When its father comes up, the child tears itself away from the bosom, flings itself back, looks at its father, laughs, as though it were fearfully funny, and falls to sucking again. Or it will bite its mother\'s breast when its little teeth are coming, while it looks sideways at her with its little eyes as though to say, \'Look, I am biting!\' Is not all that happiness when they are the three together, husband, wife and child?

As soon as men have all of them denied God - and I believe that period, analogous with geological periods, will come to pass - the old conception of the universe will fall of itself without cannibalism, and, what\'s more, the old morality, and everything will begin anew. Men will unite to take from life all it can give, but only for joy and happiness in the present world. Man will be lifted up with a spirit of divine Titanic pride and the man-god will appear. From hour to hour extending his conquest of nature infinitely by his will and his science, man will feel such lofty joy from hour to hour in doing it that it will make up for all his old dreams of joy and heaven. Everyone will know that he is mortal and will accept death proudly and serenely like a god. His pride will teach him that it\'s useless for him to repine at life\'s being a moment, and he will love his brother without need of reward. Love will be sufficient only for a moment of life, but the very consciousness of its momentariness will intensify its fire, which now is dissipated in dreams of eternal love beyond the grave.","There are three powers, three powers alone, able to conquer and to hold captive for ever the conscience of these impotent rebels for their happiness-those forces are miracle, mystery and authority.","But... that\'s absurd!\' he cried, flushing. \'Your poem is in praise of Jesus, not in blame of Him- as you meant it to be.","Snegiryov, fussing and bewildered, ran after the coffin in his old, short, almost summer coat, bare-headed, with his old wide-brimmed felt hat in his hand.

After this cruel analysis the learned of this world have nothing left of all that was sacred of old.

Yet the whole still stands steadfast before their eyes, and the gates of hell shall not prevail against it. Has it not lasted nineteen centuries, is it not still a living, a moving power in the individual soul and in the masses of people?

You are the murderer,\' he added, almost in a whisper, in a voice of genuine conviction.","Above all, don\u2019t lie to yourself. The man who lies to himself and listens to his own lie comes to such a pass that he cannot distinguish the truth within him, or around him, and so loses all respect for himself and for others. And having no respect he ceases to love, and in order to occupy and distract himself without love he gives way to passions and coarse pleasures, and sinks to bestiality in his vices, all from continual lying to other men and to himself. The man who lies to himself can be more easily offended than any one. You know it is sometimes very pleasant to take offense, isn\u2019t it?

Shower upon him every earthly blessing, drown him in a sea of happiness, so that nothing but bubbles of bliss can be seen on the surface; give him economic prosperity, such that he should have nothing else to do but sleep, eat cakes and busy himself with the continuation of his species, and even then out of sheer ingratitude, sheer spite, man would play you some nasty trick. He would even risk his cakes and would deliberately desire the most fatal rubbish, the most uneconomical absurdity, simply to introduce into all this positive good sense his fatal fantastic element. It is just his fantastic dreams, his vulgar folly that he will desire to retain, simply in order to prove to himself\u2014as though that were so necessary\u2014that men still are men and not the keys of a piano, which the laws of nature threaten to control so completely that soon one will be able to desire nothing but by the calendar. And that is not all: even if man really were nothing but a piano-key, even if this were proved to him by natural science and mathematics, even then he would not become reasonable, but would purposely do something perverse out of simple ingratitude, simply to gain his point. And if he does not find means he will contrive destruction and chaos, will contrive sufferings of all sorts, only to gain his point! He will launch a curse upon the world, and as only man can curse (it is his privilege, the primary distinction between him and other animals), may be by his curse alone he will attain his object\u2014that is, convince himself that he is a man and not a piano-key! If you say that all this, too, can be calculated and tabulated\u2014chaos and darkness and curses, so that the mere possibility of calculating it all beforehand would stop it all, and reason would reassert itself, then man would purposely go mad in order to be rid of reason and gain his point!

His house was never without guests, and it seemed he would have been unable to live without them. He had to have guests to dinner every day, even if only two, even if only one, but without guests he would not sit down to eat. He gave formal dinners, too, under all sorts of pretexts, sometimes even the most unexpected. The food he served, though not refined, was abundant, the cabbage pies were excellent, and the wines made up in quantity for what they lacked in quality.

Most likely not, but he believed solely because he desired to believe and possibly he fully believed in his secret heart even when he said, \u201cI do not believe till I see.\u201d","Such suffering and terror were what Christ spoke of.7 No, a human being should not be treated like that!\u2019 Although he could not have put all this into words as the prince had done, the valet understood, if not all of it, then the main point, and this was even visible in his features, which showed that he was moved.","Nadie llega a una verdad sin haberse equivocado catorce veces, o ciento catorce, y esto es, acaso, un honor para el g\xe9nero humano.

He understood only too well how painful it was for her to betray and unveil all that was her own. He understood that these feelings really were her secret treasure, which she had kept perhaps for years, perhaps from childhood, while she lived with an unhappy father and distracted step mother crazed by grief, in the midst of starving children and unseemly abuse and reproaches. But at the same time he knew now and knew for certain that, although it filled her with dread and suffering, yet she had a tormenting desire to read and to read to him that he might hear it, and to read now whatever might come of it! ... He read this in her eyes, he could see it in her intense emotion. She mastered herself, controlled the spasm in her throat and went on reading the eleventh chapter of St. John.","Messieurs, m\u2019\xe9criai-je de tout c\u0153ur, regardez les \u0153uvres de Dieu : le ciel est clair, l\u2019air pur, l\u2019herbe tendre, les oiseaux chantent dans la nature magnifique et innocente\xa0; seuls, nous autres, impies et stupides ne comprenons pas que la vie est un paradis, nous n\u2019aurions qu\u2019\xe0 vouloir le comprendre pour le voir appara\xeetre dans toute sa beaut\xe9, et nous nous \xe9treindrions alors en pleurant\u2026 \xbb","I really believe that at the start of the journey the condemned man, sitting in the tumbril, must feel that an infinite life still stretches ahead of him.

But here\'s the turning into the next street! Never mind though, never mind, still a whole street to go. And no matter how many houses he passes, he still thinks: \\"There are still a lot of houses.\\" And so to the very end, right up until they reach the town square.","our national, criminal cases bear witness precisely to something universal, to some general malaise that has taken root among us, and with which, as with universal evil, it is already very difficult to contend.","Yes, guilty.\u2019 It is better to let ten who are guilty go, than to punish one who is innocent\u2014do you hear, do you hear this majestic voice from the last century of our glorious history?","\xab\xbfPara qu\xe9 vivir?
