One must therefore be a fox to recognize traps, and a lion to frighten wolves.","Power is the pivot on which everything hinges. He who has the power is always right; the weaker is always wrong.","Politics have no relation to morals.","All courses of action are risky, so prudence is not in avoiding danger (it\'s impossible), but calculating risk and acting decisively. Make mistakes of ambition and not mistakes of sloth. Develop the strength to do bold things, not the strength to suffer.","One of the great secrets of the day is to know how to take possession of popular prejudices and passions, in such a way as to introduce a confusion of principles which makes impossible all understanding between those who speak the same language and have the same interests.","Women are the most charitable creatures, and the most troublesome. He who shuns women passes up the trouble, but also the benefits. He who puts up with them gains the benefits, but also the trouble. As the saying goes, there\'s no honey without bees.","Never do an enemy a small injury.","It is just as difficult and dangerous to try to free a people that wants to remain servile as it is to enslave a people that wants to remain free.","I desire to go to Hell and not to Heaven. In the former I shall enjoy the company of popes, kings and princes, while in the latter are only beggars, monks and apostles","You know better than I that in a Republic talent is always suspect. A man attains an elevated position only when his mediocrity prevents him from being a threat to others. And for this reason a democracy is never governed by the most competent, but rather by those whose insignificance will not jeopardize anyone else\'s self-esteem.","Entrepreneurs are simply those who understand that there is little difference between obstacle and opportunity and are able to turn both to their advantage.","The wise man does at once what the fool does finally.","Whoever wishes to foresee the future must consult the past; for human events ever resemble those of preceding times. This arises from the fact that they are produced by men who ever have been, and ever shall be, animated by the same passions, and thus they necessarily have the same results.","Any man who tries to be good all the time is bound to come to ruin among the great number who are not good.","Rome remained free for four hundred years and Sparta eight hundred, although their citizens were armed all that time; but many other states that have been disarmed have lost their liberties in less than forty years.","Men in general judge more from appearances than from reality. All men have eyes, but few have the gift of penetration.","It should be borne in mind that there is nothing more difficult to arrange, more doubtful of success, and more dangerous to carry through than initiating changes. The innovator makes enemies of all those who prospered under the old order, and only lukewarm support is forthcoming from those who would prosper under the new. Their support is lukewarm ... partly because men are generally incredulous, never really trusting new things unless they have tested them by experience.","And what physicians say about disease is applicable here: that at the beginning a disease is easy to cure but difficult to diagnose; but as time passes, not having been recognized or treated at the outset, it becomes easy to diagnose but difficult to cure. The same thing occurs in affairs of state; for by recognizing from afar the diseases that are spreading in the state (which is a gift given only to the prudent ruler), they can be cured quickly; but when, not having been recognized, they are  not recognized and are left to grow to the extent that everyone recognizes them, there is no longer any cure.","One who deceives will always find those who allow themselves to be deceived.","Men are so stupid and concerned with their present needs, they will always let themselves be deceived.","Ability and perseverance are the weapons of weakness.","Men are driven by two principal impulses, either by love or by fear.","Make no small plans for they have no power to stir the soul.","If an injury has to be done to a man it should be so severe that his vengeance need not be feared.","Make mistakes of ambition and not mistakes of sloth. Develop the strength to do bold things, not to suffer.","Never was anything great achieved without danger.","The more sand has escaped from the hourglass of our life, the clearer we should see through it.","There is nothing as likely to succeed as what the enemy believes you cannot attempt.","I\'m not interested in preserving the status quo; I want to overthrow it.","It is double pleasure to deceive the deceiver.","It is better to be loved rather than feared, or feared rather than loved? It might perhaps be answered that we should wish to be both: but since love and fear can hardly exist together, if we must choose between them, it is far safer to be feared than loved.","Men are of three different capacities: one understands intuitively; another understands so far as it is explained; and a third understands neither of himself nor by explanation. The first is excellent, the second, commendable, and the third, altogether useless.","You must know, then, that there are two methods of fighting, the one by law, the other by force: the first method is that of men, the second of beasts; but as the first method is often insufficient, one must have recourse to the second.","For the great majority of mankind are satisfied with appearances, as though they were realities, and are often more influenced by the things that seem than by those that are.","There is no surer sign of decay in a country than to see the rites of religion held in contempt.","A battle that you win cancels all your mistakes.","For a long time I have not said what I believed, nor do I ever believe what I say, and if indeed sometimes I do happen to tell the truth, I hide it among so many lies that it is hard to find.","The unarmed man is not just defenseless - he is also contemptible.","There is nothing more important than appearing to be religious.","The leader should know how to enter into evil when necessity commands.","Everyone who wants to know what will happen ought to examine what has happened: everything in this world in any epoch has their replicas in antiquity.","Hatred is gained as much by good works as by evil.","No enterprise is more likely to succeed than one concealed from the enemy until it is ripe for execution.","The ends justifies the means.","One can make this generalization about men: they are ungrateful, fickle, liars, and deceivers, they shun danger and are greedy for profit; while you treat them well, they are yours. They would shed their blood for you, risk their property, their lives, their children, so long, as I said above, as danger is remote; but when you are in danger they turn against you.","I hold strongly to this: that it is better to be impetuous than circumspect; because fortune is a woman and if she is to be submissive it is necessary to beat and coerce her.","Men are so simple of mind, and so much dominated by their immediate needs, that a deceitful man will always find plenty who are ready to be deceived.","Before all else, be armed.","How perilous it is to free a people who prefer slavery.","the wise man should always follow the roads that have been trodden by the great, and imitate those who have most excelled, so that if he cannot reach their perfection, he may at least acquire something of its savour.","A wise ruler should rely on what is under his own control, not on what is under the control of others.","The state is not an organism capable of bringing either moral or material improvements to the populace...but merely a vehicle of power for the men and party in power.","Gold will not always get you good soldiers, but good soldiers can get you gold.","One should never fall in the belief that you can find someone to pick you up.","If you only notice human proceedings, you may observe that all who attain great power and riches, make use of either force or fraud; and what they have acquired either by deceit or violence, in order to conceal the disgraceful methods of attainment, they endeavor to sanctify with the false title of honest gains.","He who wishes to be obeyed must know how to command.","Impetuosity and audacity often achieve what ordinary means fail to achieve.","Wars begin when you will, but they do not end when you please.","People should either be caressed or crushed. If you do them minor damage they will get their revenge; but if you cripple them there is nothing they can do. If you need to injure someone, do it in such a way that you do not have to fear their vengeance.","There is no other way to guard yourself against flattery than by making men understand that telling you the truth will not offend you.","An armed republic submits less easily to the rule of one of its citizens than a republic armed by foreign forces. Rome and Sparta were for many centuries well armed and free. The Swiss are well armed and enjoy great freedom. Among other evils caused by being disarmed, it renders you contemptible. It is not reasonable to suppose that one who is armed will obey willingly one who is unarmed; or that any unarmed man will remain safe among armed servants.","The promise given was a necessity of the past: the word broken is a necessity of the present.","For the mob is always impressed by appearances and by results, and the world is composed of the mob.","Appear as you may wish to be","Where the willingness is great, the difficulties cannot be great.","Laa shay\'a waqi\'un moutlaq bale kouloun moumkine...We work in the Dark, to serve the Light.","It is better to be adventurous than cautious, because fortune is a woman.","I consider it a mark of great prudence in a man to abstain from threats or any contemptuous expressions, for neither of these weaken the enemy, but threats make him more cautious, and the other excites his hatred, and a desire to revenge himself.","When evening comes, I return home and go into my study. On the threshold I strip off my muddy, sweaty clothes of everyday, and put on the robes of court and palace, and in this graver dress I enter the antique courts of the ancients and am welcomed by them, and there I taste the food that alone is mine, and for which I was born. And there I make bold to speak to them and ask the motives of their actions, and they, in their humanity, reply to me. And for the space of four hours I forget the world, remember no vexation, fear poverty no more, tremble no more at death; I pass indeed into their world.","Change has no constituency.","A prince... must learn from the fox and the lion... One must be a fox in order to recognize traps, and a lion to frighten off wolves. Those who act simply as lions are stupid. So it follows that a prudent ruler cannot, and must not, honour his word when it places him at a disadvantage and when the reasons for which he made his promise no longer exist.","He who has once begun to live by rapine always finds reasons for taking what is not his.","There is no avoiding war; it can only be postponed to the advantage of others.","It is often found that modesty and humility not only do no good, but are positively hurtful, when they are shown to the arrogant who have taken up a prejudice against you, either from envy or from any other cause.","He who builds on the people, builds on the mud","It ought to be remembered that there is nothing more difficult to take in hand, more perilous to conduct, or more uncertain in its success, than to take the lead in the introduction of a new order of things. Because the innovator has for enemies all those who have done well under the old conditions, and lukewarm defenders in those who may do well under the new. This coolness arises partly from fear of the opponents, who have the laws on their side, and partly from the incredulity of men, who do not readily believe in new things until they have had a long experience of them.","He who desires or attempts to reform the government of a state and wishes to have it accepted, must at least retain the semblance of the old forms; so that it may seem to the people that there has been no change in the institutions, even though in fact they are entirely different from the old ones. For the great majority of mankind are satisfied with appearances, as though they were realities.","When you disarm your subjects, however, you offend them by showing that either from cowardliness or lack of faith, you distrust them; and either conclusion will induce them to hate you.","It has always been the opinion and judgment of wise men that nothing can be so uncertain as fame or power not founded on its own strength.","I hold it to be a proof of great prudence for men to abstain from threats and insulting words toward anyone, for neither diminishes the strength of the enemy.","Minds are of three kinds: one is capable of thinking for itself; another is able to understand the thinking of others; and a third can neither think for itself nor understand the thinking of others. The first is of the highest excellence, the second is excellent, and the third is worthless.","Results are often obtained by impetuosity and daring which could never have been obtained by ordinary methods.","For this is the tragedy of man circumstances change, but he does not.","It is not titles that honor men, but men that honor titles.","When fortune wishes to bring mighty events to a successful conclusion, she selects some man of spirit and ability who knows how to seize the opportunity she offers.","Whoever is the cause of another becoming powerful, is ruined himself.","All the armed prophets conquered; all the unarmed ones perished.","A prince never lacks legitimate reasons to break his promise.","There is nothing so difficult or so dangerous as to undertake to change the order of things.","Good order makes men bold, and confusion, cowards.","The best fortress which a prince can possess is the affection of his people.","There are three kinds of intelligence: one kind understands things for itself, the other appreciates what others can understand, the third understands neither for itself nor through others. This first kind is excellent, the second good, and the third kind useless.","To be feared is much safer then to be loved.","Those who either from imprudence or want of sagacity avoid doing so, are always overwhelmed with servitude and poverty; for faithful servants are always servants, and honest men are always poor; nor do any ever escape from servitude but the bold and faithless, or from poverty, but the rapacious and fraudulent.","Men are so simple and so much inclined to obey immediate needs that a deceiver will never lack victims for his deceptions.","No one should therefore fear that he cannot accomplish what others have accomplished, for, men are born, live, and die in quite the same way they always have.","There is simply no comparison between a man who is armed and one who is not. It is simply unreasonable to expect that an armed man should obey one who is unarmed, or that an unarmed man should remain safe and secure when his servants are armed.","A prudent man... must behave like those archers who, if they are skillful, when the target seems too distant, know the capabilities of their bow and aim a good deal higher than their objective, not in order to shoot so high but so that by aiming high they can reach the target.","Men should be either treated generously or destroyed, because they take revenge for slight injuries - for heavy ones they cannot.","He who blinded by ambition, raises himself to a position whence he cannot mount higher, must thereafter fall with the greatest loss.","So in all human affairs one notices, if one examines them closely, that it is impossible to remove one inconvenience without another emerging.","It is necessary that the prince should know how to color his nature well, and how to be a hypocrite and dissembler. For men are so simple, and yield so much to immediate necessity, that the deceiver will never lack dupes.","Wisdom consists in being able to distinguish among dangers and make a choice of the least harmful.","Whosoever desires constant success must change his conduct with the times.","The peasant wants only to be left alone to prosper in peace.","You have to be a prince to understand the people, and you have to belong to the people to understand the princes.","Men never do good unless necessity drives them to it; but when they are free to choose and can do just as they please, confusion and disorder become rampant.","By the delusions of seeming good the people are often misled to desire their own ruin; and they are frequently influenced by great hopes and brave promises.","A wise man will see to it that his acts always seem voluntary and not done by compulsion, however much he may be compelled by necessity.","It is a common failing of man not to take account of tempests during fair weather.","Few men are brave by nature, but good discipline and experience make many so.","Nothing feeds upon itself as liberality does.","One should never permit a disorder to persist in order to avoid a war, for wars cannot be avoided and can only be deferred to the advantage of others.","Men rise from one ambition to another: first, they seek to secure themselves against attack, and then they attack others.","A battle that you win cancels any other bad action of yours. In the same way, by losing one, all the good things worked by you before become vain.","Though fraud in all other actions be odious, yet in matters of war it is laudable and glorious, and he who overcomes his enemies by stratagem is as much to be praised as he who overcomes them by force.","Men are always wicked at bottom unless they are made good by some compulsion.","The wish to acquire more is admittedly a very natural and common thing; and when men succeed in this they are always praised rather than condemned. But when they lack the ability to do so and yet want to acquire more at all costs, they deserve condemnation for their mistakes.","One must be a fox to recognize traps and a lion to frighten wolves","Fear is secured by a dread of punishment.","Delusion gives you more happiness than truth gives to me. For injuries ought to be done all at one time, so that, being tasted less, they offend less; benefits ought to be given little by little, so that the flavour of them may last longer.","Therefore it is unnecessary for a prince to have all the good qualities I have enumerated, but it is very necessary to appear to have them.","Knowing how to fight made men more bold, because no one fears doing what it seems to him he has learned to do. Therefore, the ancients wanted their citizens to be trained in every warlike action.","For, in truth, there is no sure way of holding other than by destroying","Among other evils which being unarmed brings you, it causes you to be despised.","Men generally decide upon a middle course, which is most hazardous, for they know neither how to be entirely good nor entirely bad.","Men seldom rise from low condition to high rank without employing either force or fraud, unless that rank should be attained either by gift or inheritance.","Half of these aren\'t even Machiavelli. Some are Plato, Thucydides etc....doesnt anyone check these?","Nature creates few men brave, industry and training makes many.","Anyone who becomes master of a city accustomed to freedom and does not destroy it may expect to be destroyed by it; for such a city may always justify rebellion in the name of liberty and its ancient institutions.","Every one sees what you appear to be, few really know what you are, and those few dare not oppose themselves to the opinion of the many, who have the majesty of the state to defend them.","The chief foundations of all states, new as well as old or composite, are good laws and good arms.","I don\'t doubt that every prince would like to be both; but since it is hard to accomodate these qualities, if you have to make a choice, to be feared is much safer than to be loved. For it is a good general rule about men, that they are ungrateful, fickle, liars, and deceivers, fearful of danger and greedy for gain....[love] is a link of obligation which men, because they are rotten, will break anything they think doing so serves their advantage; but fear involves dread of punishment, from which they can never escape.","He who makes war his profession cannot be otherwise than vicious. War makes thieves, and peace brings them to the gallows.","Princes should delegate to others the enactment of unpopular measures and keep in their own hands the means of winning favours.","Men judge generally more by the eye than by the hand, for everyone can see and few can feel. Every one sees what you appear to be, few really know what you are.","Men are always averse to enterprises in which they foresee difficulties.","The vulgar crowd always is taken by appearances, and the world consists chiefly of the vulgar.","How we live is so different from how we ought to live that he who studies what ought to be done rather than what is done will learn the way to his downfall rather than to his preservation.","A wise prince will seek means by which his subjects will always and in every possible condition of things have need of his government, and then they will always be faithful to him.","When neither their property nor their honor is touched, the majority of men live content.","If the chief party, whether it be the people, or the army, or the nobility, which you think most useful and of most consequence to you for the conservation of your dignity, be corrupt, you must follow their humor and indulge them, and in that case honesty and virtue are pernicious.","Forgiveness proceeds from a generous soul.","A wise prince then...should never be idle in times of peace but should industriously lay up stores of which to avail himself in times of adversity so that when fortune abandons him he may be prepared to resist her blows.","A wise ruler ought never to keep faith when by doing so it would be against his interests.","It is a foolish prince who entrusts the safety of his lands to hired men.","The prince must be a lion, but he must also know how to play the fox.","Prudence therefore consists in knowing how to distinguish degrees of disadvantage.","God creates men, but they choose each other.","A prudent man should always follow in the path trodden by great men and imitate those who are most excellent, so that if he does not attain to their greatness, at any rate he will get some tinge of it.","Republics have a longer life and enjoy better fortune than principalities, because they can profit by their greater internal diversity. They are the better able to meet emergencies.","One change always leaves the way open for the establishment of others.","Men sooner forget the death of their father than the loss of their patrimony","A return to first principles in a republic is sometimes caused by the simple virtues of one man. His good example has such an influence that the good men strive to imitate him, and the wicked are ashamed to lead a life so contrary to his example.","And when neither their property nor honour is touched, the majority of men live content, and he has only to contend with the ambition of a few, whom he can curb with ease in many ways.","The fact is that a man who wants to act virtuously in every way necessarily comes to grief among so many who are not virtuous.","One must consider the final result","Hence it comes that all armed Prophets have been victorious, and all unarmed Prophets have been destroyed.","In our own days we have seen no princes accomplish great results save those who have been accounted miserly.","In the same manner, having been reduced by disorder, and sunk to their utmost state of depression, unable to descend lower, they, of necessity, reascend; and thus from good they gradually decline to evil, and from evil again return to good. The reason is, that valor produces peace; peace, repose; repose, disorder; disorder, ruin; so from disorder order springs; from order virtue, and from this, glory and good fortune.","There is nothing more difficult to plan, more doubtful of success, nor more dangerous to manage than the creation of a new order of things..... Whenever his enemies have occasion to attack the innovator they do so with the passion of partisans, while the others defend him sluggishly so that the innovator and his party alike are vulnerable.","A multitude is strong while it holds together, but so soon as each of those who compose it begins ro think of his own private danger, it becomes weak and contemptible.","He who becomes a Prince through the favour of the people should always keep on good terms with them; which it is easy for him to do, since all they ask is not to be oppressed","Conquered states that have been accustomed to liberty and the government of their own laws can be held by the conqueror in three different ways. The first is to ruin them; the second, for the conqueror to go and reside there in person; and the third is to allow them to continue to live under their own laws, subject to a regular tribute, and to create in them a government of a few, who will keep the country friendly to the conqueror","Any man who tries to be good all the time is bound to come to ruin among the great number who are not good. Hence a prince who wants to keep his authority must learn how not to be good, and use that knowledge, or refrain from using it, as necessity requires.","War is a profession by which a man cannot live honorably; an employment by which the soldier, if he would reap any profit, is obliged to be false, rapacious, and cruel.","A prince who is not himself wise cannot be wisely advised. . . . Good advice depends on the shrewdness of the prince who seeks it, and not the shrewdness of the prince on good advice.","Although deceit is detestable in all other things, yet in the conduct of war it is laudable and honorable; and a commander who vanquishes an enemy by stratagem is equally praised with one who gains victory by force.","Speaking generally, men are ungrateful, fickle, hypocritical, fearful odanger and covetous ogain.","It makes him contemptible to be considered fickle, frivolous, effeminate, mean-spirited, irresolute, from all of which a prince should guard himself as from a rock; and he should endeavour to show in his actions greatness, courage, gravity, and fortitude; and in his private dealings with his subjects let him show that his judgments are irrevocable, and maintain himself in such reputation that no one can hope either to deceive him or to get round him.","A prince need trouble little about conspiracies when the people are well disposed, but when they are hostile and hold him in hatred, then he must fear everything and everybody.","There are three kinds of minds: first those that attain insight and understanding of things by their own means, then those that recognize what is right when others explain it to them, and finally those that are capable of neither one nor the other.","Necessities can be many, but the one that is stronger is that which constrains you to win or to die.","Where the very safety of the country depends upon the resolution to be taken, no consideration of justice or injustice, humanity or cruelty, nor of glory or of shame, should be allowed to prevail. But putting all other considerations aside, the only question should be: What course will save the life and liberty of the country?","A prince is also respected when he is a true friend and a true enemy; that is, when he declares himself on the side of one prince against another without any reservation.","Men are less hesitant about harming someone who makes himself loved than one who makes himself feared because love is held together by a chain of obligation which, since men are wretched creatures, is broken on every occasion in which their own interests are concerned; but fear is sustained by dread of punishment which will never abandon you.","Men as a whole judge more with their eyes than with their hands.","I assert once again as a truth to which history as a whole bears witness that men may second their fortune, but cannot oppose it; that they may weave its warp, but cannot break it. Yet they should never give up, because there is always hope, though they know not the end and more towards it along roads which cross one another and as yet are unexplored; and since there is hope, they should not despair, no matter what fortune brings or in what travail they find themselves.","To ensure victory the troops must have confidence in themselves as well as in their commanders.","In truth, there never was any remarkable lawgiver amongst any people who did not resort to divine authority, as otherwise his laws would not have been accepted by the people; for there are many good laws, the importance of which is known to be the sagacious lawgiver, but the reasons for which are not sufficiently evident to enable him to persuade others to submit to them; and therefore do wise men, for the purpose of removing this difficulty, resort to divine authority.","Tardiness often robs us opportunity, and the dispatch of our forces.","It is better to be bold than too circumspect, because fortune is of a sex which likes not a tardy wooer and repulses all who are not ardent.","For, besides what has been said, it should be borne in mind that the temper of the multitude is fickle, and that while it is easy to persuade them of a thing, it is hard to fix them in that persuasion","Well used are those cruelties (if it is permitted to speak well of evil) that are carried out in a single stroke, done out of necessity to protect oneself, and are not continued but are instead converted into the greatest possible benefits for the subjects. Badly used are those cruelties which. although being few at the outset, grow with the passing time instead of disappearing. Those who follow the first method can remedy their condition with God and with men; the others cannot possibly survive.","So far as he is able, a prince should stick to the path of good but, if the necessity arises, he should know how to follow evil.","And above all you ought to guard against leading an army to fight which is afraid or which is not confident of victory. For the greatest sign of an impending loss is when one does not believe one can win.","Wisdom consists of knowing how to distinguish the nature of trouble, and in choosing the lesser evil.","Men ought either to be well treated, or crushed.","A man who is used to acting in one way never changes; he must come to ruin when the times, in changing, no longer are in harmony with his ways.","The distinction between children and adults, while probably useful for some purposes, is at bottom a specious one, I feel. There are only individual egos, crazy for love.","One can generally say this about men: that they are ungrateful, fickle, simulators and deceivers, avoiders of danger, greedy for gain; and while you work for their good they are completely yours, offering you their blood, their property, their lives, and their sons when danger is far away; but when it comes nearer to you, they turn away.","Men shrink less from offending one who inspires love than one who inspires fear.","The new ruler must determine all the injuries that he will need to inflict. He must inflict them once and for all.","Men in general judge more by the sense of sight than by the sense of touch, because everyone can see but few can test by feeling. Everyone sees what you seem to be, few know what you really are; and those few do not dare take a stand against the general opinion.","We have not seen great things done in our time except by those who have been considered mean; the rest have failed.","Thus it is well to seem merciful, faithful, humane, sincere, religious, and also to be so; but you must have the mind so disposed that when it is needful to be otherwise you may be able to change to the opposite qualities.","For government consists in nothing else but so controlling subjects that they shall neither be able to, nor have cause to do [it] harm.","The reason is that nature has so created men that they are able to desire everything but are not able to attain everything: so that the desire being always greater than the acquisition, there results discontent with the possession and little satisfaction to themselves from it. From this arises the changes in their fortunes; for as men desire, some to have more, some in fear of losing their acquisition, there ensues enmity and war, from which results the ruin of that province and the elevation of another.","Severities should be dealt out all at once, so that their suddenness may give less offense; benefits ought to be handed ought drop by drop, so that they may be relished the more.","There should be many judges, for few will always do the will of few.","Whoever takes it upon himself to establish a commonwealth and prescribe laws must presuppose all men naturally bad, and that they will yield to their innate evil passions as often as they can do so with safety.","If the present be compared with the remote past, it is easily seen that in all cities and in all peoples there are the same desires and the same passions as there always were.","The Romans never allowed a trouble spot to remain simply to avoid going to war over it, because they knew that wars don\'t just go away, they are only postponed to someone else\'s advantage. Therefore, they made war with Philip and Antiochus in Greece, in order not to have to fight them in Italy... They never went by that saying which you constantly hear from the wiseacres of our day, that time heals all things. They trusted rather their own character and prudence- knowing perfectly well that time contains the seeds of all things, good as well as bad.","For that reason, let a prince have the credit of conquering and holding his state, the means will always be considered honest, and he will be praised by everybody because the vulgar are always taken by what a thing seems to be and by what comes of it; and in the world there are only the vulgar, for the few find a place there only when the many have no ground to rest on.","One arises from a low to a high station more often by using fraud instead of force.","God is not willing to do everything, and thus take away our free will and that share of glory which belongs to us.","For among other evils caused by being disarmed, it renders you contemptible; which is one of those disgraceful things which a prince must guard against.","When you disarm the people, you commence to offend them and show that you distrust them either through cowardice or lack of confidence, and both of these opinions generate hatred.","A prince ought to have no other aim or thought, nor select anything else for his study, than war and its rules and discipline; for this is the sole art that belongs to him who rules, and it is of such force that it not only upholds those who are born princes, but it often enables men to rise from a private station to that rank. And, on the contrary, it is seen that when princes have thought more of ease than of arms they have lost their states. And the first cause of your losing it is to neglect this art; and what enables you to acquire a state is to be master of the art.","A wise man ought always to follow the paths beaten by great men, and to imitate those who have been supreme, so that if his ability does not equal theirs, at least it will savor of it. Let him act like the clever archers who, designing to hit the mark which yet appears too far distant, and knowing the limits to which the strength of their bow attains, take aim much higher than the mark, not to reach by their strength or arrow to so great a height, but to be able with the aid of so high an aim to hit the mark they wish to reach.","Decide which is the line of conduct that presents the fewest drawbacks and then follow it out as being the best one, because one never finds anything perfectly pure and unmixed, or exempt from danger.","Therefore the best fortress is to be found in the love of the people, for although you may have fortresses they will not save you if you are hated by the people.","Thus it happens in matters of state; for knowing afar off (which it is only given a prudent man to do) the evils that are brewing, they are easily cured.  But when, for want of such knowledge, they are allowed to grow so that everyone can recognize them, there is no longer any remedy to be found.","In respect to foresight and firmness, the people are more prudent, more stable, and have better judgement than princes.","Because there are three classes of intellects: one which comprehends by itself; another which appreciates what others comprehend; and a third which neither comprehends by itself nor by the showing of others; the first is the most excellent, the second is good, the third is useless.","it is much safer to be feared than loved because ...love is preserved by the link of obligation which, owing to the baseness of men, is broken at every opportunity for their advantage; but fear preserves you by a dread of punishment which never fails.","Men are more apt to be mistaken in their generalizations than in their particular observations.","One should never allow chaos to develop in order to avoid going to war, because one does not avoid a war but instead puts it off to his disadvantage","And it will always happen that he who is not your friend will request your neutrality and he who is your friend will ask you to declare yourself by taking up arms. And irresolute princes, in order to avoid present dangers, follow the neutral road most of the time, and most of the time they are ruined.","The princes who have done great things are the ones who have taken little account of their promises.","God and nature have thrown all human fortunes into the midst of mankind; and they are thus attainable rather by rapine than by industry, by wicked actions rather than by good. Hence it is that men feed upon each other, and those who cannot defend themselves must be worried.","You do not know the unfathomable cowardice of humanity...servile in the face of force, pitiless in the face of weakness, implacable before blunders, indulgent before crimes...and patient to the point of martyrdom before all the violences of bold despotism.","All the States and Governments by which men are or ever have been ruled, have been and are either Republics or Princedoms.","The nature of man is such that people consider themselves put under an obligation as much by the benefits they confer as by those they receive.","It is a true observation of ancient writers, that as men are apt to be cast down by adversity, so they, are easily satiated with prosperity, and that joy and grief produce the same effects. For whenever men are not obliged by necessity to fight they fight from ambition, which is so powerful a passion in the human breast that however high we reach we are never satisfied.","I hope and hoping feeds my pain \\nI weep and weeping feeds my failing heart\\nI laugh but the laughter does not pass within\\nI burn but the burning makes no mark outside.","Princes and governments are far more dangerous than other elements within society.","In the armies and among every ten men there is one of more life, of more heart, or at least of more authority, who with his courage, with words and by example keeps the others firm and disposed to fight.","The world has always been the same; and there is always as much good fortune as bad in it.","War is just when it is necessary; arms are permissible when there is no hope except in arms.","There is nothing more difficult to take in hand, more perilous to conduct, or more uncertain in its success, than to take the lead in the introduction of a new order of things.","We must bear in mind, then, that there is nothing more difficult and dangerous, or more doubtful of success, than an attempt to introduce a new order of things in any state. For the innovator has for enemies all those who derived advantages from the old order of things, whilst those who expect to be benefited by the new institutions will be but lukewarm defenders.","Occasionally words must serve to veil the facts. But let this happen in such a way that no one become aware of it; or, if it should be noticed, excuses must be at hand to be produced immediately.","Besides what has been said, people are fickle by nature; and it is a simple to convince them of something but difficult to hold them in that conviction; and, therefore, affairs should be managed in such a way that when they no longer believe, they can be made to believe by force.","Many have dreamed up republics and principalities that have never in truth been known to exist; the gulf between how one should live and how one does live is so wide that a man who neglects what is actually done for what should be done learns the way to self-destruction rather than self-preservation.","States that rise quickly, just as all the other things of nature that are born and grow rapidly, cannot have roots and ramifications; the first bad weather kills them","Hence it happened that all the armed prophets conquered, all the unarmed perished.\\n[It., Di qui nacque che tutti li profeti armati vincero, e li disarmati rovinarono.]","The forces of adversaries are more diminished by the loss of those who flee than of those who are killed.","When settling disputes between his subjects, he should ensure that his judgement is irrevocable; and he should be so regarded that no one ever dreams of trying to deceive or trick him.","Never lead your soldiers to battle if you have not first confirmed their spirit and known them to be without fear and ordered; and never test them except when you see that they hope to win.","He who has not first laid his foundations may be able with great ability to lay them afterwards, but they will be laid with trouble to the architect and danger to the building.","Good order and discipline in any army are to be depended upon more than courage alone.","The innovator has for enemies all who have done well under the old, and lukewarm defenders in those who may do well under the new.","Nothing is of greater importance in time of war than in knowing how to make the best use of a fair opportunity when it is offered.","The reformer has enemies in all who profit by the old order, and only lukewarm defenders in all those who would profit by the new order.","I am firmly convinced, therefore, that to set up a republic which is to last a long time, the way to set about it is to constitute it as Sparta and Venice were constituted; to place it in a strong position, and so to fortify it that no one will dream of taking it by a sudden assault; and, on the other hand, not to make it so large as to appear formidable to its neighbors. It should in this way be able to enjoy its form of government for a long time. For war is made on a commonwealth for two reasons: to subjugate it, and for fear of being subjugated by it.","It makes him hated above all things, as I have said, to be rapacious, and to be a violator of the property and women of his subjects, from both of which he must abstain.","And the prince who has relied solely on their words, without making other preparations, is ruined, for the friendship which is gained by purchase and not through grandeur and nobility of spirit is merited but is not secured, and at times is not to be had.","So long as the great majority of men are not deprived of either property or honor, they are satisfied.","For without invention, no one was ever a great man in his own trade.","And if such malignity is hidden for a time, it proceeds from the unknown reason that would not be known because the experience of the contrary had not been seen, but time, which is said to be the father of every truth, will cause it to be discovered.","....for friendships that are acquired by a price and not by greatness and nobility of character are purchased but are not owned, and at the proper moment they cannot be spent.","Since it is difficult to join them together, it is safer to be feared than to be loved when one of the two must be lacking.","....nothing is so unhealthy or unstable as the reputation for power that is not based on one\'s own power.","When every province of the world so teems with inhabitants that they can neither subsist where they are nor remove themselves elsewhere.","It is much safer for the prince to be feared than loved, but he ought to avoid making himself hated.","The greatest remedy that is used against a plan of the enemy is to do voluntarily what he plans that you do by force.","The sinews of war are not gold, but good soldiers; for gold alone will not procure good soldiers, but good soldiers will always procure gold.","With difficulty he is beaten who can estimate his own forces and those of his enemy.","The main foundations of every state, new states as well as ancient or composite ones, are good laws and good arms you cannot have good laws without good arms, and where there are good arms, good laws inevitably follow.","The people resemble a wild beast, which, naturally fierce and accustomed to live in the woods, has been brought up, as it were, in a prison and in servitude, and having by accident got its liberty, not being accustomed to search for its food, and not knowing where to conceal itself, easily becomes the prey of the first who seeks to incarcerate it again.","From the latter he is defended by being well armed and having good allies, and if he is well armed he will have good friends, and affairs will always remain quiet within when they are quiet without, unless they should have been already disturbed by conspiracy; and even should affairs outside be disturbed, if he has carried out his preparations and has lived as I have said, as long as he does not despair, he will resist every attack.","Benefits should be conferred gradually; and in that way they will taste better.","The prince who relies upon their words, without having otherwise provided for his security, is ruined; for friendships that are won by awards, and not by greatness and nobility of soul, although deserved, yet are not real, and cannot be depended upon in time of adversity.","A son can bear with equanimity the loss of his father, but the loss of his inheritance may drive him to despair.","He who neglects what is done for what ought to be done, sooner effects his ruin than his preservation.","He who would foresee what is to happen should look to what has happened: for all that is has its counterpart in time past.","In war, discipline can do more than fury.","Therefore, in order not to have to rob his subjects, to be able to defend himself, not to become poor and contemptible, and not to be forced to become rapacious, a prince must consider it of little importance if he incurs the name of miser, for this is one of the vices that permits him to rule.","Men nearly always follow the tracks made by others and proceed in their affairs by imitation, even though they cannot entirely keep to the tracks of others or emulate the prowess of their models. So a prudent man should always follow in the footsteps of great men and imitate those who have been outstanding.","Whoever is the cause of another becoming powerful, is ruined himself; for that power is produced by him either through craft or force; and both of these are suspected by the one who has been raised to power.","War should be the only study of a prince. He should consider peace only as a breathing-time, which gives him leisure to contrive, and furnishes as ability to execute, military plans.","You must never believe that the enemy does not know how to conduct his own affairs. Indeed, if you want to be deceived less and want to bear less danger, the more the enemy is weak or the less the enemy is cautious, so much more must you esteem him.","One man should not be afraid of improving his posessions, lest they be taken away from him, or another deterred by high taxes from starting a new business. Rather, the Prince should be ready to reward men who want to do these things and those who endeavour in any way to increase the prosperity of their city or their state.","That prince is highly esteemed who conveys this impression of himself, and he who is highly esteemed is not easily conspired against; for, provided it is well known that he is an excellent man and revered by his people, he can only be attacked with difficulty.","I say that every prince must desire to be considered merciful and not cruel. He must, however, take care not to misuse this mercifulness.","In conclusion, the arms of others either fall from your back, or they weigh you down, or they bind you fast.","War brings out thieves and peace hangs them.","For as laws are necessary that good manners may be preserved, so there is need of good manner that laws may be maintained.\\n[It., Perche, cosi come i buoni costumi, per mantenersi, hanno bisogno delli leggi; cosi le leggi per ossevarsi, hanno bisogno de\' buoni costumi.]","A prince, therefore, must not mind incurring the charge of cruelty for the purpose of keeping his subjects united and confident; for, with a very few examples, he will be more merciful than those who, from excess of tenderness, allow disorders to arise, from whence spring murders and rapine; for these as a rule injure the whole community, while the executions carried out by the prince injure only one individual. And of all princes, it is impossible for a new prince to escape the name of cruel, new states being always full of dangers.","When men receive favours from someone they expected to do them ill, they are under a greater obligation to their benefactor.","The answer is, of course, that it would be best to be both loved and feared. But since the two rarely come together, anyone compelled to choose will find greater security in being feared than in being loved.","The prince must consider, as has been in part said before, how to avoid those things which will make him hated or contemptible; and as often as he shall have succeeded he will have fulfilled his part, and he need not fear any danger in other reproaches.","Men walk almost always in the paths trodden by others, proceeding in their actions by imitation.","Cruelties should be committed all at once.","One never finds anything perfectly pure and ... exempt from danger.","....it cannot be called ingenuity to kill one\'s fellow citizens, to betray friends, to be without faith, without mercy, without religion; by these means one can aquire power but not glory.","A blast in the human breast is nothing to boast of.","A man who wishes to make a profession of goodness in everything must necessarily come to grief among so many who are not good. Therefore, it is necessary for a prince, who wishes to maintain himself, to learn how not to be good, and to use this knowledge and not use it according to the necessity of the case.","Therefore, it is necessary to be a fox to discover the snares and a lion to terrify the wolves","When they remain in garrison, soldiers are maintained with fear and punishment; when they are then led to war, with hope and reward.","Of mankind we may say in general they are fickle, hypocritical, and greedy of gain.","And here one must not that hatred is acquired just as much by means of good actions as by bad ones; and so, as I said above, if a prince wishes to maintain the state, he is often obliged not to be good; because whenever that group which you believe you need to support you is corrupted, whether it be the common people, the soldiers, or the nobles, it is to your advantage to follow their inclinations in order to satisfy them; and then good actions are your enemy.","as the physicians say it happens in hectic fever, that in the beginning of the malady it is easy to cure but difficult to detect, but in the course of time, not having been either detected or treated in the beginning, it becomes easy to detect but difficult to cure","He who is the cause of another\'s advancement is thereby the cause of his own ruin.","To keep your actions and your plans secret always has been a very good thing . .. Marcus Crassus said to one who asked him when he was going to move the army: \'Do you believe that you will be the only one not to hear the trumpet?","How laudable it is for a prince to keep good faith and live with integrity, and not with astuteness, every one knows. Still the experience of our times shows those princes to have done great things who have had little regard for good faith, and have been able by astuteness to confuse men\'s brains, and who have ultimately overcome those who have made loyalty their foundation.","For as good habits of the people require good laws to support them, so laws, to be observed, need good habits on the part of the people.","...it is a base thing to look to others for your defense instead of depending upon yourself. That defense alone is effectual, sure, and durable which depends upon yourself and your own valor.","From this arises the question whether it is better to be loved rather than feared, or feared rather than loved. It might perhaps be answered that we should wish to be both: but since love and fear can hardly exist together, if we must choose between them, it is far safer to be feared than loved.","Men are more ready to offend one who desires to be beloved than one who wishes to be feared.","And if, to be sure, sometimes you need to conceal a fact with words, do it in such a way that it does not become known, or, if it does become known, that you have a ready and quick defense.","For titles do not reflect honor on men, but rather men on their titles.","Present wars impoverish the lords that win as much as those that lose.","It may be observed, that provinces amid the vicissitudes to which they are subject, pass from order into confusion, and afterward recur to a state of order again; for the nature of mundane affairs not allowing them to continue in an even course, when they have arrived at their greatest perfection, they soon begin to decline.","A prince must not have any other object nor any other thought\u2026 but war, its institutions, and its discipline; because that is the only art befitting one who commands.","Nevertheless, he must be cautious in believing and acting, and must not inspire fear of his own accord, and must proceed in a temperate manner with prudence and humanity, so that too much confidence does not render him incautious, and too much diffidence does not render him intolerant. From this arises the question whether it is better to be loved more than feared, or feared more than loved.","But in Republics there is a stronger vitality, a fiercer hatred, a keener thirst for revenge. The memory of their former freedom will not let them rest; so that the safest course is either to destroy them, or to go and live in them.","Men ought either to be indulged or utterly destroyed, for if you merely offend them they take vengeance, but if you injure them greatly they are unable to retaliate, so that the injury done to a man ought to be such that vengeance cannot be feared.","Therefore, a prudent ruler ought not to keep faith when by so doing it would be against his interest, and when the reasons which made him bind himself no longer exist. If men were all good, this precept would not be a good one; but as they are bad, and would not observe their faith with you, so you are not bound to keep faith with them.","Still, a prince should make himself feared in such a way that if he does not gain love, he at any rate avoids hatred; for fear and the absence of hatred may well go together, and will be always attained by one who abstains from interfering with the property of his citizens and subjects or with their women.","Men are so simple and yield so readily to the desires of the moment that he who will trick will always find another who will suffer to be tricked.","Violence must be inflicted once for all; people will then forget what it tastes like and so be less resentful. Benefits must be conferred gradually; and in that way they will taste better.","Sometimes it has been of great moment while the fight is going on, to disseminate words that pronounce the enemies\' captain to be dead, or to have been conquered by another part of the army. Many times this has given victory to him who used it.","We cannot attribute to fortune or virtue that which is achieved without either.","The Swiss are well armed and enjoy great freedom.","A prince ought to have two fears, one from within, on account of his subjects, the other from without, on account of external powers.","Some princes, so as to hold securely the state, have disarmed their subjects, others have kept their subject towns distracted by factions...Our forefathers, and those who were reckoned wise, were accustomed to say that it was necessary to hold Pistoia [an Italian city] by factions and Pisa by fortress, and with this idea they fostered quarrels in some of their tributary towns so as to keep possession of them the more easily.","As the observance of divine institutions is the cause of the greatness of republics, so the disregard of them produces their ruin; for where the fear of God is wanting, there the country will come to ruin, unless it be sustained the fear of the prince, which temporarily supply the want of religion.","The one who adapts his policy to the times prospers, and likewise that the one whose policy clashes with the demands of the times does not.","Human beings remain constant in their methods of conduct.","A prince must not have any objective nor any thought, nor take up any art, other than the art of war and its ordering and discipline; because it is the only art that pertains to him who commands. And it is of such virtue that not only does it maintain those who were born princes, but many times makes men rise to that rank from private station.","I hold it to be of great prudence for men to abstain from threats and insulting words towards any one, for neither the one nor the other in any way diminishes the strength of the enemy; but the one makes him more cautious, and the other increases his hatred of you, and makes him more persevering in his efforts to injure you","They have not any difficulties on the way up because they fly, but they have many when they reach the summit.","A son could bear with great complacency, the death of his father, while the loss of his inheritance might drive him to despair.","Every little advantage is of great moment when men have to come to blows.","We must distinguish between those who depend on others, that is between those who to achieve their purposes can force the issue and those who must use persuasion. In the second case, they always come to grief, having achieved nothing; when, however, they depend on their own resources and can force the issue, then they are seldom endangered.","Therefore it is unnecessary for a prince to have all the good qualities I have enumerated, but it is very necessary to appear to have them. And I shall dare to say this also, that to have them and always to observe them is injurious, and that to appear to have them is useful; to appear merciful, faithful, humane, religious, upright, and to be so, but with a mind so framed that should you require not to be so, you may be able and know how to change to the opposite.","Is it better to be loved or feared?","It is the duty of a man of honor to teach others the good which he has not been able to do himself because of the malignity of the times, that this good finally can be done by another more loved in heaven.","And when he is obliged to take the life of any one, to do so when there is a proper justification and manifest reason for it; but above all he must abstain from taking the property of others, for men forget more easily the death of their father than the loss of their patrimony.","Because just as good morals, if they are to be maintained, have need of the laws, so the laws, if they are to be observed, have need of good morals.","For it must be noted, that men must either be caressed or else annihilated; they will revenge themselves for small injuries, but cannot do so for great ones; the injury therefore that we do to a man must be such that we need not fear his vengeance.","I believe that it is possible for one to praise, without concern, any man after he is dead since every reason and supervision for adulation is lacking.","....those who become princes through their skill acquire the pricipality with difficulty, buy they hold onto it with ease.","To know well the nature of the people one must be a prince, and to know well the nature of princes one must be of the people.","As all those have shown who have discussed civil institutions, and as every history is full of examples, it is necessary to whoever arranges to found a Republic and establish laws in it, to presuppose that all men are bad and that they will use their malignity of mind every time they have the opportunity.","Any harm you do to a man should be done in such a way that you need not fear his revenge.","For one change always leaves a dovetail into which another will fit.","Wise men say, and not without reason, that whosoever wished to foresee the future might consult the past.","One should never risk one\'s whole fortune unless supported by one\'s entire forces.","A prince being thus obliged to know well how to act as a beast must imitate the fox and the lion, for the lion cannot protect himself from snares, and the fox cannot defend himself from wolves.","A prince must be prudent enough to know how to escape the bad reputation of those vices that would lose the state for him, and must protect himself from those that will not lose it for him, if this is possible; but if he cannot, he need not concern himself unduly if he ignores these less serious vices.","All who contribute to the overthrow of religion, or to the ruin of kingdoms and commonwealths, all who are foes to letters and to the arts which confer honour and benefit on the human race (among whom I reckon the impious, the cruel, the ignorant, the indolent, the base and the worthless), are held in infamy and detestation.","(A ruler) cannot and should not keep his word when to do so would go against his interests or when the reason he pledged it no longer holds.","Then also pretexts for seizing property are never wanting, and one who begins to live by rapine will always find some reason for taking the goods of others, whereas causes for taking life are rarer and more quickly destroyed.","...people are by nature fickle, and it is easy to persuade them of something, but difficult to keep them persuaded.","There is nothing that Nature seems to have inclined us to as much as society.","...it behooves us to adapt oneself to the times if one wants to enjoy continued good fortune.","If someone puts up the argument that King Louis gave the Romagna to Pope Alexander, and the kingdom of Naples to Spain, in order to avoid a war, I would answer as I did before: that you should never let things get out of hand in order to avoid war. You don\'t avoid such a war, you merely postpone it, to your own disadvantage.","There are three kinds of brains. The one understands things unassisted, the other understands things when shown by others, the third understands neither alone nor with the explanations of others.","Nature that framed us of four elements, warring within our breasts for regiment, doth teach us all to have aspiring minds.","There are three kinds of brains: One understands of itself, another can be taught to understand, and the third can neither understand to itself or be taught to understand.","For a prince should have two fears: one, internal concerning his subjects; the other, external, concerning foreign powers. From the latter he can always defend himself by his good troops and friends; and he will always have good friends if he has good troops.","To know in war how to recognize an opportunity and seize it is better than anything else.","...the incredulity of mankind, who do not truly believe in anything new until they have had actual experience of it.","Only those means of security are good, are certain, are lasting, that depend on yourself and your own vigor.","In order not to annul our free will, I judge it true that Fortune may be mistress of one half our actions but then even she leaves the other half, or almost, under our control.","Men ought either to be well treated or crushed, because they can avenge themselves of lighter injuries, of more serious ones they cannot; therefore the injury that is to be done to a man ought to be of such a kind that one does not stand in fear of revenge.","Among other causes of misfortune which your not being armed brings upon you, it makes you despised.","No proceeding is better than that which you have concealed from the enemy until the time you have executed it. To know how to recognize an opportunity in war, and take it, benefits you more than anything else. Nature creates few men brave, industry and training makes many. Discipline in war counts more than fury.","It is necessary for him who lays out a state and arranges laws for it to presuppose that all men are evil and that they are always going to act according to the wickedness of their spirits whenever they have free scope.","Men are able to assist fortune but not to thwart her. They can weave her designs, but they cannot destroy them.","Never do your enemy a minor injury.","The end of the republic is to enervate and to weaken all other bodies so as to increase its own body.","Whoever desires to found a state and give it laws, must start with assuming that all men are bad and ever ready to display their vicious nature, whenever they may find occasion for it.","Benefits should be granted little by little, so that they may be better enjoyed.","For whoever conquers a free Town, and does not demolish it, commits a great Error, and may expect to be ruin \'d himself.","Since the handling of arms is a beautiful spectacle, it is delightful to young men.","My view is that it is desirable to be both loved and feared; but it is difficult to achieve both and, if one of them has to be lacking, it is much safer to be feared than loved.","For he who innovates will have for his enemies all those who are well off under the existing order of things, and only lukewarm supporters in those who might be better off under the new.","He who has annexed them, if he wishes to hold them, has only to bear in mind two considerations: the one, that the family of their former lord is extinguished; the other, that neither their laws nor their taxes are altered, so that in a very short time they will become entirely one body with the old principality.","It is much better to tempt fortune where it can favor you than to see your certain ruin by not tempting it.","One can say this in general of men: they are ungrateful, disloyal, insincere and deceitful, timid of danger and avid of profit...Love is a bond of obligation that these miserable creatures break whenever it suits them to do so; but fear holds them fast by a dread of punishment that never passes.","Without doubt, ferocious and disordered men are much weaker than timid and ordered ones. For order chases fear from men and disorder lessens ferocity.","The sinews of war are not gold, but good soldiers.","And truly it is a very natural and ordinary thing to desire to acquire, and always, when men do it who can, they will be praised or not blamed; but when they cannot, and wish to do it anyway, here lies the error and the blame.","The wish to acquire is in truth very natural and common, and men always do so when they can.but when they cannot do so, yet wish to do so by any means, then there is folly and blame.","For as laws are necessary that good manners be preserved, so there is need of good manners that law may be maintained.","Men may second fortune, but they cannot thwart her.","The reply is, that one ought to be both feared and loved, but as it is difficult for the two to go together, it is much safer to be feared than loved, if one of the two has to be wanting. For it may be said of men in general that they are ungrateful, voluble, dissemblers, anxious to avoid danger, and covetous of gain; as long as you benefit them, they are entirely yours; they offer you their blood, their goods, their life, and their children, as I have before said, when the necessity is remote; but when it approaches, they revolt.","Many have imagined republics and principalities which have never been seen or known to exist in reality; for how we live is so far removed from how we ought to live, that he who abandons what is done for what ought to be done, will rather bring about his own ruin than his preservation.","If the course of human affairs be considered, it will be seen that many things arise against which heaven does not allow us to guard.","Never attempt to win by force what can be won by deception.","It is not titles that honour men, but men that honour titles.","\u2026he who seeks to deceive will always find someone who will allow himself to be deceived.","Since love and fear can hardly exist together, if we must choose between them, it is far safer to be feared than loved","He who wishes to be obeyed must know how to command","And here comes in the question whether it is better to be loved rather than feared, or feared rather than loved. It might perhaps be answered that we should wish to be both; but since love and fear can hardly exist together, if we must choose between them, it is far safer to be feared than loved.","It must be remembered that there is nothing more difficult to plan, more doubtful of success, nor more dangerous to manage than a new system. For the initiator has the enmity of all who would profit by the preservation of the old institution and merely lukewarm defenders in those who gain by the new ones.","Every one sees what you appear to be, few really know what you are.","It must be considered that there is nothing more difficult to carry out, nor more doubtful of success, nor more dangerous to handle, than to initiate a new order of things.","When evening comes, I return home and go into my study. On the threshold I strip off my muddy, sweaty, workday clothes, and put on the robes of court and palace, and in this graver dress I enter the antique courts of the ancients and am welcomed by them, and there I taste the food that alone is mine, and for which I was born. And there I make bold to speak to them and ask the motives of their actions, and they, in their humanity, reply to me. And for the space of four hours I forget the world, remember no vexation, fear poverty no more, tremble no more at death: I pass indeed into their world.","There is no avoiding war, it can only be postponed to the advantage of your enemy.","Half of these aren\'t even Machiavelli.Some are Plato, Thucydides etc....doesnt anyone check these?","When evening has come, I return to my house and go into my study. At the door I take off my clothes of the day, covered with mud and mire, and I put on my regal and courtly garments; and decently reclothed, I enter the ancient courts of ancient men, where, received by them lovingly, I feed on the food that alone is mine and that I was born for. There I am not ashamed to speak with them and to ask them the reason for their actions; and they in their humanity reply to me. And for the space of four hours I feel no boredom, I forget every pain, I do not fear poverty, death does not frighten me. I deliver myself entirely to them.","I conclude therefore that, fortune being changeful and mankind steadfast in their ways, so long as the two are in agreement men are successful, but unsuccessful when they fall out. For my part I consider that it is better to be adventurous than cautious, because fortune is a woman, and if you wish to keep her under it is necessary to beat and ill-use her; and it is seen that she allows herself to be mastered by the adventurous rather than by those who go to work more coldly. She is, therefore, always, woman-like, a lover of young men, because they are less cautious, more violent, and with more audacity command her.","It is better to be feared than loved, if you cannot be both.","CHAPTER VIConcerning New Principalities Which Are Acquired By One\'s Own Arms And AbilityLET no one be surprised if, in speaking of entirely new principalities as I shall do, I adduce the highest examples both of prince and of state; because men, walking almost always in paths beaten by others, and following by imitation their deeds, are yet unable to keep entirely to the ways of others or attain to the power of those they imitate. A wise man ought always to follow the paths beaten by great men, and to imitate those who have been supreme, so that if his ability does not equal theirs, at least it will savour of it. Let him act like the clever archers who, designing to hit the mark which yet appears too far distant, and knowing the limits to which the strength of their bow attains, take aim much higher than the mark, not to reach by their strength or arrow to so great a height, but to be able with the aid of so high an aim to hit the mark they wish to reach.","He who is highly esteemed is not easily conspired against;","And it ought to be remembered that there is nothing more difficult to take in hand, more perilous to conduct, or more uncertain in its success, than to take the lead in the introduction of a new order of things.","Men intrinsically do not trust new things that they have not experienced themselves.","It\'s better to be impulsive than cautious; fortune is female and if you want to stay on top of her you have to slap and thrust. You\'ll see she\'s more likely to yield that way than to men who go about her coldly. And being a woman she likes her men young, because they\'re not so cagey, they\'re wilder and more daring when they master her.","A prudent man will always try to follow in the footsteps of great men and imitate those who have been truly outstanding, so that, if he is not quite as skillful as they, at least some of their ability may rub off on him.","A prince is also esteemed when he is a true friend and a true enemy.","There is no other way of guarding against adulation, than to make people understand that they will not offend you by speaking the truth. On the other hand, when everyone feels at liberty to tell you the truth, they will be apt to be lacking in respect to you.","He who causes another to become powerful ruins himself, for he brings such a power into being either by design or by force, and both of these elements are suspects to the one whom he has made powerful.","It is necessary for a prince wishing to hold his own to know how to do wrong, and to make use of it or not according to necessity.","Everything that occurs in the world, in every epoch, has something that corresponds to it in ancient times.","When everyone feels free to tell you the truth, respect for you dwindles\u2026 A wise prince should take another course: choose wise men for your advisors, and allow only them the liberty of speaking the truth to the prince, and only on matters about which you ask, and nothing else. But you should question them about everything, listen patiently to their opinions, then form your own conclusions later.","Being feared and not hated go well together, and the prince can always do this if he does not touch the property or the women of his citizens and subjects.","I desire to go to Hell and not to Heaven. In the former I shall enjoy the company of popes, kings and princes, while in the latter are only beggars, monks and apostles.","Hence it comes that all armed prophets have been victorious, and all unarmed prophets have been destroyed.","For whoever believes that great advancement and new benefits make men forget old injuries is mistaken.","But when you disarm them, you at once offend them by showing that you distrust them, either for cowardice or for want of loyalty, and either of these opinions breeds hatred against you.","And yet we cannot define as skillful killing one\'s fellow citizens, betraying one\'s friends, and showing no loyalty, mercy, or moral obligation. These means can lead to power, but not glory.","From this arises the following question: whether it is better to be loved than feared, or the reverse. The answer is that one would like to be both the one and the other, but because they are difficult to combine, it is far better to be loved than feared if you cannot be both.","But confining myself more to the particular, I say that a prince may be seen happy to-day and ruined to-morrow without having shown any change of disposition or character. This, I believe, arises firstly from causes that have already been discussed at length, namely, that the prince who relies entirely upon fortune is lost when it changes. I believe also that he will be successful who directs his actions according to the spirit of the times, and that he whose actions do not accord with the times will not be successful. Because men are seen, in affairs that lead to the end which every man has before him, namely, glory and riches, to get there by various methods; one with caution, another with haste; one by force, another by skill; one by patience, another by its opposite; and each one succeeds in reaching the goal by a different method. One can also see of two cautious men the one attain his end, the other fail; and similarly, two men by different observances are equally successful, the one being cautious, the other impetuous; all this arises from nothing else than whether or not they conform in their methods to the spirit of the times. This follows from what I have said, that two men working differently bring about the same effect, and of two working similarly, one attains his object and the other does not.","you ought never to suffer your designs to be crossed in order to avoid war, since war is not so to be avoided, but is only deferred to your disadvantage.","Therefore any cruelty has to be executed at once, so that the less it is tasted, the less it offends; while benefits must be dispensed little by little, so that they will be savored all the more.","But above all he must refrain from seizing the property of others, because a man is quicker to forget the death of his father than the loss of his patrimony.","It\'s better to be feared than loved if you cannot be both.","Men desire novelty to such an extent that those who are doing well wish for a change as much as those who are doing badly.","The fact is that a man who wants to act virtuous in every way necessarily comes to grief among so many who are not virtuous.","Men must either be caressed or else destroyed.","Men are so simple, and governed so absolutely by their present needs, that he who wishes to deceive will never fail in finding willing dupes.","I certainly believe this: that it is better to be impetuous than cautious, because Fortune is a woman, and if you want to keep her under it is necessary to beat her and force her down. It is clear that she more often allows herself to be won over by impetuous men than by those who proceed coldly. And so, like a woman, Fortune is always the friend of young men, for they are less cautious, more ferocious, and command her with more audacity.","Quod Principi plaevit habet legis vigorem","Thus it is well to seem merciful, faithful, humane, sincere, religious, and also to be so; but you must have the mind so disposed that when it is needful to be otherwise you may be able to change to the opposite qualities. And it must be understood that a prince, and especially a new prince, cannot observe all those things which are considered good in men, being often obliged, in order to maintain the state, to act against faith, against charity, against humanity, and against religion. And, therefore, he must have a mind disposed to adapt itself according to the wind, and as the variations of fortune dictate, and, as I said before, not deviate from what is good, if possible, but be able to do evil if constrained.","The Romans never allowed a trouble spot to remain simply to avoid going to war over it, because they knew that wars don\'t just go away, they are only postponed to someone else\'s advantage. Therefore, they made war with Philip and Antiochus in Greece, in order not to have to fight them in Italy... They never went by that saying which you constantly hear from the wiseacres of our day, that time heals all things. They trusted rather their own character and prudence\u2014 knowing perfectly well that time contains the seeds of all things, good as well as bad.","In peace one is despoiled by the mercenaries, in war by one\'s enemies.","Let no man, therefore, lose heart from thinking that he cannot do what others have done before him; for, as I said in my Preface, men are born, and live, and die, always in accordance with the same rules.","A prince is also esteemed when he shows himself a true friend or a true enemy, that is, when, without reservation, he takes his stand with one side or the other. This is always wiser than trying to be neutral, for if two powerful neighbors of yours fall out they are either of such sort that the victor may give you reason to fear him or they are not. In either case it will be better for you to take sides and wage an honest war.","Returning to the question of being feared or loved, I conclude that since men love at their own will and fear at the will of the prince, a wise prince must build a foundation on what is his own, and not on what belongs to others.","A man who wishes to profess at all times will come to ruin among so many who are not good.","For this reason a prince ought to take care that he never lets anything slip from his lips that is not replete with the above-named five qualities, that he may appear to him who sees and hears him altogether merciful, faithful, humane, upright, and religious. There is nothing more necessary to appear to have than this last quality, inasmuch as men judge generally more by the eye than by the hand, because it belongs to everybody to see you, to few to come in touch with you. Every one sees what you appear to be, few really know what you are, and those few dare not oppose themselves to the opinion of the many, who have the majesty of the state to defend them; and in the actions of all men, and especially of princes, which it is not prudent to challenge, one judges by the result.","Alexander never did what he said, \xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0 Cesare never said what he did.","Without an opportunity, their abilities would have been wasted, and without their abilities, the opportunity would have arisen in vain.","And let it here be noted that men are either to be kindly treated, or utterly crushed, since they can revenge lighter injuries, but not graver. Wherefore the injury we do to a man should be of a sort to leave no fear of reprisals.","There are three classes of intellects: one which comprehends by itself; another which appreciates what others comprehend; and a third which neither comprehends by itself nor by the showing of others; the first is the most excellent, the second is good, and the third is useless..","For since men for the most part follow in the footsteps and imitate the actions of others, and yet are unable to adhere exactly to those paths which others have taken, or attain to the virtues of those whom they would resemble, the wise man should always follow the roads that have been trodden by the great, and imitate those who have most excelled, so that if he cannot reach their perfection, he may at least acquire something of its savour. Acting in this like the skilful archer, who seeing that the object he would hit is distant, and knowing the range of his bow, takes aim much above the destined mark; not designing that his arrow should strike so high, but that flying high it may alight at the point intended.","For a Monarchy readily becomes a Tyranny, an Aristocracy an Oligarchy, while a Democracy tends to degenerate into Anarchy. So that if the founder of a State should establish any one of these three forms of Government, he establishes it for a short time only, since no precaution he may take can prevent it from sliding into its contrary, by reason of the close resemblance which, in this case, the virtue bears to the vice.","One must be a fox in order to recognize traps, and a lion to frighten off wolves. Those who simply act like lions are stupid.","..it happens in all human affairs that we never seek to escape one mischief without falling into another. Prudence therefore consists in knowing how to distinguish degrees of disadvantage, and in accepting a less evil as a good.","En general, los hombres juzgan m\xe1s por los ojos que por la inteligencia, pues todos pueden ver, pero pocos comprenden lo que ven.","For however strong you may be in respect of your army, it is essential that in entering a new Province you should have the good will of its inhabitants.","Men nearly always follow the tracks made by others and proceed in their affairs by imitation, even though they cannot entirely keep to the tracks of others or emulate the prowess of their models. So a prudent man should always follow in the footsteps of great men and imitate those who have been outstanding. If his own prowess fails to compare with theirs, at least it has an air of greatness about it. He should behave like those archers who, if they are skilful, when the target seems too distant, know the capabilities of their bow and aim a good deal higher than their objective, not in order to shoot so high but so that by aiming high they can reach the target.","It is safer to be feared than loved","Keep your friends close, keep your enemies closer.","As a general thing anyone who is not your friend will advise neutrality while anyone who is your friend will ask you to join him, weapon in hand.","...the manner in which we live, and that in which we ought to live, are things so wide asunder, that he who quits the one to betake himself to the other is more likely to destroy than to save himself; since any one who would act up to a perfect standard of goodness in everything, must be ruined among so many who are not good.","For when you are on the spot, disorders are detected in their beginnings and remedies can be readily applied; but when you are at a distance, they are not heard of until they have gathered strength and the case is past cure.","Any injury we do to a man must be such that we need not fear his vengeance.","In general you must either pamper people or destroy them; harm them just a little and they\u2019ll hit back; harm them seriously and they won\u2019t be able to. So if you\u2019re going to do people harm, make sure you needn\u2019t worry about their reaction.","And as the observance of religious teaching is the cause of the greatness of republics, similarly, disdain for it is the cause of their ruin. For where the fear of God is lacking, the state must necessarily either come to ruin or be held together by the fear of a prince that will compensate for the lack of religion.","And in examining their life and deeds it will be seen that they owed nothing to fortune but the opportunity which gave them matter to be shaped into the form that they thought fit; and without that opportunity their powers would have been wasted, and without their powers the opportunity would have come in vain.","For this can be said of men in general: that they are ungrateful, fickle, hypocrites and dissemblers, avoiders of dangers, greedy for gain; and while you benefit them, they are entirely yours, offering you their blood, their goods, their life, their children,...when need is far away, but when you actually become needy, they turn away.

Wishing, therefore, to turn men from this error, I have judged it necessary to write on all those books of Titus Livy...","A wise man ought always to follow the paths beaten by great men, and to imitate those who have been supreme, so that if his ability does not equal theirs, at least it will savor of it.

For whenever men are not obliged to fight from necessity, they fight from ambition; which is so powerful in human breasts, that it never leaves them no matter to what rank they rise. The reason is that nature has so created men that they are able to desire everything but are not able to attain everything: so that the desire being always greater than the acquisition, there results discontent with the possession and little satisfaction to themselves from it. From this arises the changes in their fortunes; for as men desire, some to have more, some in fear of losing their acquisition, there ensues enmity and war, from which results the ruin of that province and the elevation of another.","when they depend upon their own resources and can employ force, they seldom fail. Hence it comes that all armed Prophets have been victorious, and all unarmed Prophets have been destroyed.","Therefore a wise prince ought to adopt such a course that his citizens will always in every sort and kind of circumstance have need of the state and of him, and then he will always find them faithful.","it is far better to earn the confidence of the people than to rely on fortresses.","Thus it is well to seem merciful faithful humane religious and upright and also to be so but the mind should remain so balanced that were it needful not to be so you should be able and know how to change to the contrary.","When a newly acquired State has been accustomed, as I have said, to live under its own laws and in freedom, there are three methods whereby it may be held. The first is to destroy it; the second, to go and reside there in person; the third, to suffer it to live on under its own laws, subjecting it to a tribute, and entrusting its government to a few of the inhabitants who will keep the rest your friends. Such a Government, since it is the creature of the new Prince, will see that it cannot stand without his protection and support, and must therefore do all it can to maintain him; and a city accustomed to live in freedom, if it is to be preserved at all, is more easily controlled through its own citizens than in any other way.","Men will not look at things as they really are, but as they wish them to be - and are ruined","For, besides what has been said, it should be borne in mind that the temper of the multitude is fickle, and that while it is easy to persuade them of a thing, it is hard to fix them in that persuasion.

My reply is that I would like to be both but as it is difficult to combine love and fear, if one has to choose between them it is far safer to be feared than loved","No enterprise is more likely to succeed than one concealed from the enemy until it is ripe for execution.Nothing is of greater importance in time of war than in knowing how to make the best use of a fair opportunity when it is offered.Few men are brave by nature, but good discipline and experience make many so.","If you only notice human proceedings, you may observe that all who attain great power and riches, make use of either force or fraud; and what they have acquired either by deceit or violence, in order to conceal the disgraceful methods of attainment, they endeavor to sanctify with the false title of honest gains. Those who either from imprudence or want of sagacity avoid doing so, are always overwhelmed with servitude and poverty; for faithful servants are always servants, and honest men are always poor; nor do any ever escape from servitude but the bold and faithless, or from poverty, but the rapacious and fraudulent. God and nature have thrown all human fortunes into the midst of mankind; and they are thus attainable rather by rapine than by industry, by wicked actions rather than by good. Hence it is that men feed upon each other, and those who cannot defend themselves must be worried.","That defense alone is effectual, sure and durable which depends upon yourself and your own valour.","But since my intention is to write something useful for anyone who understands it, it seemed more suitable for me to search after the effectual truth of the matter rather than its imagined one. Many writers have imagined republics and principalities that have never been seen nor known to exist in reality. For there is such a distance between how one lives and how one ought to live, that anyone who abandons what is done for what ought to be done achieves his downfall rather than his preservation.","The Romans recognized potential difficulties in advance and always remedied them in time. They never let problems develop just so they could escape a war, for they knew that such wars cannot be avoided, only postponed to the advantage of others.","He, therefore, who acquires such a State, if he mean to keep it, must see to two things; first, that the blood of the ancient line of Princes be destroyed; second, that no change be made in respect of laws or taxes; for in this way the newly acquired State speedily becomes incorporated with the hereditary.","For Time, driving all things before it, may bring with it evil as well as good.","Whence we may draw the general axiom, which never or rarely errs, that he who is the cause of another\u2019s greatness is himself undone, since he must work either by address or force, each of which excites distrust in the person raised to power.","He said that it always struck him with surprise that while men in buying an earthen or glass vase would sound it first to learn if it were good, yet in choosing a wife they were content with only looking at her.","But while it was their opportunities that made these men fortunate, it was their own merit that enabled them to recognize these opportunities and turn them to account, to the glory and prosperity of their country.","The people, as Cicero says, may be ignorant, but they can recognize the truth and will readily yield when some trustworthy man explains it to them.","For the friendships which we buy with a price, and do not gain by greatness and nobility of character, though they be fairly earned are not made good, but fail us when we have occasion to use them.","The memory of their former freedom will not let them rest; so that the safest course is either to destroy them, or to go and live in them.","It is better to be feared than to be loved, if you can not be both","An unavoidable war is called justice. When brutality is the only option left it is holy","The gulf between how one should live and how one does live is so wide that a man who neglects what is actually done for what should be done learns the way to self-destruction rather than self-preservation.","Vertr\xe4ge bricht man um des Nutzens willen.","And let it here be noted that men are either to be kindly treated, or utterly crushed, since they can revenge lighter injuries, but not graver.","For on Cardinal Rohan saying to me that the Italians did not understand war, I replied that the French did not understand politics.","Upon this, one has to remark that men ought either to be well treated or crushed, because they can avenge themselves of lighter injuries, of more serious ones they cannot; therefore the injury that is to be done to a man ought to be of such a kind that one does not stand in fear of revenge.","Many have imagined republics and principalities which have never been seen or known to exist in reality, for how we live is so far removed from how we ought to live, that he who abandons what is done for what ought to be done will rather bring about his ruin than his preservation.","The Swiss are well armed and very free.","For a Monarchy readily becomes a Tyranny, an Aristocracy an Oligarchy, while a Democracy tends to degenerate into Anarchy.","I say, then, that hereditary States, accustomed to the family of their Prince, are maintained with far less difficulty than new States, since all that is required is that the Prince shall not depart from the usages of his ancestors, trusting for the rest to deal with events as they arise.","These opportunities, then, gave these men the chance they needed, and their great abilities made them recognize it.","he who is the cause of another becoming powerful is ruined; because that predominancy has been brought about either by astuteness or else by force, and both are distrusted by him who has been raised to power.","Make mistakes of ambition and not mistakes of sloth.

So it is in politics.","men live peacefully as long as their old way of life is maintained and there is no change in customs.","And what physicians say about consumptive illnesses is applicable here: that at the beginning, such an illness is easy to cure but difficult to diagnose; but as time passes, not having been recognized or treated at the outset, it becomes easy to diagnose but difficult to cure.","... one would like to be both [loved and feared], but as it is difficult to combine both love and fear, if one has to choose between them it is far safer to be feared than loved","It is truly natural and ordinary thing to desire gain; and when those who can succeed attempt it, they will always be praised and not blamed.

For it will always happen that some such person will be called in by those of the Province who are discontented either through ambition or fear; as we see of old the Romans brought into Greece by the Aetolians, and in every other country that they entered, invited there by its inhabitants. And the usual course of things is that so soon as a formidable stranger enters a Province, all the weaker powers side with him, moved thereto by the ill-will they bear towards him who has hitherto kept them in subjection. So that in respect of these lesser powers, no trouble is needed to gain them over, for at once, together, and of their own accord, they throw in their lot with the government of the stranger. The new Prince, therefore, has only to see that they do not increase too much in strength, and with his own forces, aided by their good will, can easily subdue any who are powerful, so as to remain supreme in the Province. He who does not manage this matter well, will soon lose whatever he has gained, and while he retains it will find in it endless troubles and annoyances.","Moreover, a Republic trusting to her own forces, is with greater difficulty than one which relies on foreign arms brought to yield obedience to a single citizen. Rome and Sparta remained for ages armed and free. The Swiss are at once the best armed and the freest people in the world.","I say that every prince must desire to be considered merciful and not cruel. He must, however, take care not to misuse this mercifulness. \u2026 A prince, therefore, must not mind incurring the charge of cruelty for the purpose of keeping his subjects united and confident; for, with a very few examples, he will be more merciful than those who, from excess of tenderness, allow disorders to arise, from whence spring murders and rapine; for these as a rule injure the whole community, while the executions carried out by the prince injure only one individual. And of all princes, it is impossible for a new prince to escape the name of cruel, new states being always full of dangers. \u2026 Nevertheless, he must be cautious in believing and acting, and must not inspire fear of his own accord, and must proceed in a temperate manner with prudence and humanity, so that too much confidence does not render him incautious, and too much diffidence does not render him intolerant.","Men injure either from fear or hatred.","This is to be asserted in general of men, that they are ungrateful, fickle, false, cowardly, covetous and as long as you succeed they are yours entirely; they will offer you their blood, property, life and children when the need is far distant; but when it approaches they turn against you.","Because fear and ove can hardly co exist together,if we must chose between them, it is far safer to be feared than loved.","As all those have shown who have discussed civil institutions, and as every history is full of examples, it is necessary to whoever arranges to found a Republic and establish laws in it, to presuppose that all men are bad and that they will use their malignity of mind every time they have the opportunity; and if such malignity is hidden for a time, it proceeds from the unknown reason that would not be known because the experience of the contrary had not been seen, but time, which is said to be the father of every truth, will cause it to be discovered.","Upon this, one has to remark that men ought either to be well treated or crushed because they can avenge themselves of lighter injuries; of more serious ones they cannot, therefore the injury that is to be done to a man ought to be of such a kind that one does not stand in fear of revenge.","And the usual course of affairs is that, as soon as a powerful foreigner enters a country, all the subject states are drawn to him, moved by the hatred that they feel against the ruling power.","Injuries, therefore, should be inflicted all at once, that their ill savour being less lasting may the less offend; whereas, benefits should be conferred little by little, that so they may be more fully relished.","he wise man should always follow the roads that have been trodden by the great, and imitate those who have most excelled, so that if he cannot reach their perfection, he may at least acquire something of its savour.","Prudence therefore consists in knowing how to distinguish degrees of disadvantage, and in accepting a less evil as a good.","it is essential that in entering a new Province you should have the good will of its inhabitants.","\u0644\u0630\u0644\u0643 \u0641\u0625\u0646\u0646\u0627 \u0625\u0630\u0627 \u0623\u0631\u062f\u0646\u0627 \u0623\u0646 \u0646\u062a\u0646\u0627\u0648\u0644 \u0647\u0630\u0647 \u0627\u0644\u0642\u0636\u064a\u0629 \u0628\u062f\u0642\u0629 \u060c \u0644\u0627\u0628\u062f \u0627\u0646 \u0646\u0639\u0631\u0641 \u0623\u0648\u0644\u0627\u064b \u0645\u0627 \u0625\u0630\u0627 \u0643\u0627\u0646 \u0627\u0644\u0645\u0635\u0644\u062d\u0648\u0646 \u064a\u0639\u062a\u0645\u062f\u0648\u0646 \u0639\u0644\u0649 \u0623\u0646\u0641\u0633\u0647\u0645 \u060c \u0627\u0645 \u0623\u0646\u0647\u0645 \u064a\u0639\u062a\u0645\u062f\u0648\u0646 \u0639\u0644\u0649 \u0627\u0644\u0623\u062e\u0631\u064a\u0646 . \u0648\u0628\u0639\u0628\u0627\u0631\u0629 \u0623\u062e\u0631\u0649 : \u0647\u0644 \u0647\u0645 \u0642\u0627\u062f\u0631\u0648\u0646 \u0639\u0644\u0649 \u0627\u0633\u062a\u0645\u0627\u0644\u0629 \u063a\u064a\u0631\u0647\u0645 \u0644\u064a\u0646\u0641\u0630\u0648\u0627 \u0645\u0627 \u0648\u0636\u0639\u0648\u0647 \u0644\u0647\u0645 \u0623\u0645 \u0623\u0646\u0647\u0645 \u064a\u0633\u062a\u0637\u064a\u0639\u0648\u0646 \u0641\u0631\u0636\u0647 \u061f\u0641\u0641\u064a \u0627\u0644\u062d\u0627\u0644\u0629 \u0627\u0644\u0623\u0648\u0644\u0649 \u0644\u0646 \u064a\u062d\u0642\u0642\u0648\u0627 \u0633\u0648\u0649 \u0641\u0648\u0632\u0627\u064b \u0636\u0639\u064a\u0641\u0627\u064b . \u0648\u0644\u0627 \u064a\u0646\u062c\u0632\u0648\u0646 \u0634\u064a\u0626\u0627\u064b . \u0623\u0645\u0627 \u0625\u0630\u0627 \u0627\u0633\u062a\u0637\u0627\u0639\u0648\u0627 \u0627\u0644\u0627\u0639\u062a\u0645\u0627\u062f \u0639\u0644\u0649 \u0633\u0637\u0648\u062a\u0647\u0645 \u0648\u0644\u062f\u064a\u0647\u0645 \u0627\u0644\u0642\u062f\u0631\u0629 \u0639\u0644\u0649 \u0627\u0633\u062a\u062e\u062f\u0627\u0645 \u0642\u0648\u062a\u0647\u0645 \u0641\u0625\u0646\u0647\u0645 \u0644\u0627 \u064a\u0641\u0634\u0644\u0648\u0646 \u0625\u0644\u0627 \u0641\u064a\u0645\u0627 \u0646\u062f\u0631 . \u0648\u0628\u0647\u0630\u0647 \u0627\u0644\u0637\u0631\u064a\u0642\u0629 \u0627\u0633\u062a\u0637\u0627\u0639 \u062c\u0645\u064a\u0639 \u0627\u0644\u0623\u0646\u0628\u064a\u0627\u0621 \u0627\u0644\u0645\u0633\u0644\u062d\u064a\u0646 \u0623\u0646 \u064a\u0646\u062a\u0635\u0631\u0648\u0627 \u0641\u064a\u0645\u0627 \u0641\u0634\u0644 \u0641\u064a\u0647 \u063a\u064a\u0631 \u0627\u0644\u0645\u0633\u0644\u062d\u064a\u0646 \u0645\u0646\u0647\u0645 . \u0648\u0630\u0644\u0643 -\u0628\u0627\u0644\u0625\u0636\u0627\u0641\u0629 \u0625\u0644\u0649 \u0645\u0627 \u0630\u0643\u0631\u0646\u0627\u0647 - \u064a\u0631\u062c\u0639 \u0625\u0644\u0649 \u0623\u0646 \u0637\u0628\u064a\u0639\u0629 \u0627\u0644\u0628\u0634\u0631 \u0645\u062a\u0642\u0644\u0628\u0629 . \u0648\u0645\u0646 \u0627\u0644\u0633\u0647\u0644 \u062a\u062d\u0641\u064a\u0632\u0647\u0645 \u0644\u0634\u064a\u0621 \u0645\u0627 \u0648\u0644\u0643\u0646 \u0645\u0646 \u0627\u0644\u0635\u0639\u0628 \u0627\u0633\u062a\u0645\u0631\u0627\u0631 \u0647\u0630\u0627 \u0627\u0644\u062d\u0627\u0641\u0632 .\u0644\u0630\u0644\u0643 \u064a\u062c\u0628 \u0623\u0646 \u0646\u0631\u062a\u0628 \u0623\u0645\u0648\u0631\u0646\u0627 \u062d\u062a\u0649 \u064a\u0645\u0643\u0646\u0646\u0627 \u0623\u0646 \u0646\u0633\u062a\u062e\u062f\u0645 \u0627\u0644\u0642\u0648\u0629 \u0645\u0639\u0647\u0645 \u0644\u0646\u0631\u062f\u0647\u0645 \u0625\u0644\u0649 \u0627\u0644\u0625\u064a\u0645\u0627\u0646 \u0628\u0645\u0627 \u0627\u0631\u062a\u062f\u0648\u0627 \u0639\u0646\u0647 .","The wish to acquire is no doubt a natural and common sentiment, and when men attempt things within their power, they will always be praised rather than blamed.

And, first, if the Princedom be not wholly new, but joined on to the ancient dominions of the Prince, so as to form with them what may be termed a mixed Princedom, changes will come from a cause common to all new States, namely, that men, thinking to better their condition, are always ready to change masters, and in this expectation will take up arms against any ruler; wherein they deceive themselves, and find afterwards by experience that they are worse off than before","Men will not look at things as they really are, but as they wish them to be\u2014and are ruined.","Because the Romans did in these instances what all prudent princes ought to do, who have to regard not only present troubles, but also future ones, for which they must prepare with every energy, because, when foreseen, it is easy to remedy them; but if you wait until they approach, the medicine is no longer in time because the malady has become incurable; for it happens in this, as the physicians say it happens in hectic fever, that in the beginning of the malady it is easy to cure but difficult to detect, but in the course of time, not having been either detected or treated in the beginning, it becomes easy to detect but difficult to cure.

Whosoever becomes prince of a city or State, more especially if his position be so insecure that he cannot resort to constitutional government either in the form of a republic or a monarchy, will find that the best way to preserve his princedom is to renew the whole institutions of that State; that is to say, to create new magistracies with new names, confer new powers, and employ new men, and like David when he became king, exalt the humble and depress the great, \\"filling the hungry with good things, and sending the rich empty away.\\" Moreover, he must pull down existing towns and rebuild them, removing their inhabitants from one place to another; and, in short, leave nothing in the country as he found it; so that there shall be neither rank, nor condition, nor honour, nor wealth which its possessor can refer to any but to him. And he must take example from Philip of Macedon, the father of Alexander, who by means such as these, from being a petty prince became monarch of all Greece; and of whom it was written that he shifted men from province to province as a shepherd moves his flocks from one pasture to another. These indeed are most cruel expedients, contrary not merely to every Christian, but to every civilized rule of conduct, and such as every man should shun, choosing rather to lead a private life than to be a king on terms so hurtful to mankind. But he who will not keep to the fair path of virtue, must to maintain himself enter this path of evil. Men, however, not knowing how to be wholly good or wholly bad, choose for themselves certain middle ways, which of all others are the most pernicious, as shall be shown by an instance in the following Chapter.","Men judge more from appearances than reality. All men have eyes, but few have the gift of penetration.Everyone sees your exterior, but few candiscern what you have in your heart.","for men do easily part with their prince upon hopes of bettering their condition, and that hope provokes them to rebel; but most commonly they are mistaken, and experience tells them their condition is much worse.","Just as artists who draw landscapes get down in the valley to study the mountains and go up to the mountains to look down on the valley, so one has to be a prince to get to know the character of a people and a man of the people to know the character of a prince.","When you see a Minister thinking more of himself than of you, and in all his actions seeking his own ends, that man can never be a good Minister or one that you can trust. For he who has the charge of the State committed to him, ought not to think of himself, but only of his Prince, and should never bring to the notice of the latter what does not directly concern him.","Fear is as dangerous an enemy as resentment.","For injuries ought to be done all at one time, so that, being tasted less, they offend less; benefits ought to be given little by little, so that the flavour of them may last longer.","The first opinion which one forms of a prince, and of his understanding, is by observing the men he has around him; and when they are capable and faithful he may always be considered wise, because he has known how to recognize the capable and to keep them faithful. But when they are otherwise one cannot form a good opinion of him, for the prime error which he made was in choosing them.","But in republics, there is more vitality, greater hatred, and more desire for vengeance, which will never permit them to allow the memory of their former liberty to rest so that the safest way is to destroy them or to reside there.","... If instead of colonies you send troops, the cost is vastly greater, and the whole revenues of the country are spent in guarding it so that the gain becomes a loss, and much deeper offense is given since in shifting the quarters of your soldiers from place to place the whole country suffers hardship, which as all feel, all are made enemies and enemies who remaining, although vanquished, in their own homes, have power to hurt. In every way, therefore, this mode of defense is as disadvantageous as that by colonizing is useful.","A prince, therefore, ought always to take counsel, but only when he wishes and not when others wish; he ought rather to discourage every one from offering advice unless he asks it; but, however, he ought to be a constant inquirer, and afterwards a patient listener concerning the things of which he inquired; also, on learning that any one, on any consideration, has not told him the truth, he should let his anger be felt.","And there is nothing wastes so rapidly as liberality, for even whilst you exercise it you lose the power to do so, and so become either poor or despised, or else - in avoiding poverty - rapacious and hated. And a leader should guard himself, above all things, against being despised and hated; and liberality leads you to both. Therefore it is wiser to have a reputation for austerity which brings reproach without hatred, than to be compelled through seeking a reputation for liberality to incur a name for rapacity which begets reproach with hatred.","And let it be noted that there is no more delicate matter to take in hand, nor more dangerous to conduct, nor more doubtful in its success, than to set up as a leader in the introduction of changes.","he who thinks new favours will cause great personages to forget old injuries deceives himself.","I say that every prince ought to desire to be considered clement and not cruel. Nevertheless he ought to take care not to misuse this clemency.","A Prince should esteem the great, but must not make himself odious to the people.","Whether this has ever happened I know not, nor whether it ever can happen. For we see, as I have said a little way back, that a city which owing to its pervading corruption has once begun to decline, if it is to recover at all, must be saved not by the excellence of the people collectively, but of some one man then living among them, on whose death it at once relapses into its former plight; as happened with Thebes, in which the virtue of Epaminondas made it possible while he lived to preserve the form of a free Government, but which fell again on his death into its old disorders; the reason being that hardly any ruler lives so long as to have time to accustom to right methods a city which has long been accustomed to wrong.","The salvation of a republic or a kingdom is not, therefore, merely to have a prince who governs prudently while he lives, but rather one who organizes the government in such a way that after his death it can be maintained.","The wise prince, therefore, has always avoided these arms and turned to his own and has been willing rather to lose with them than to conquer with the others, not deeming that a real victory which is gained with the arms of others.","God is unwilling to do everything Himself, lest He deprive us of our free will and of that portion of glory that belongs to us.","Men judge more from appearances than reality. All men have eyes, but few have the gift of penetration. Everyone sees your exterior, but few candiscern what you have in your heart.","A sculptor will more easily extract a beautiful statue from a piece of rough marble than from one that has been badly blocked out by someone else.","If princes are indeed superior to the people in enacting laws, in organizing civil governments, in setting up new statues and ordinances, then doubtless the people are so superior in maintaining what has been instituted that they increase the glory of those who instituted them.","A prince, as I have said before, sooner becomes hated by being rapacious and by interfering with the property and with the women of his subjects, than in any other way. From these, therefore, he should abstain. For so long as neither their property nor their honour is touched, the mass of mankind live contentedly, and the prince has only to cope with the ambition of a few, which can in many ways and easily be kept within bounds.A prince is despised when he is seen to be fickle, frivolous, effeminate, pusillanimous, or irresolute, against which defects he ought therefore most carefully to guard, striving so to bear himself that greatness, courage, wisdom, and strength may appear in all his actions. In his private dealings with his subjects his decisions should be irrevocable, and his reputation such that no one would dream of overreaching or cajoling him.","war is not so to be avoided, but is only deferred to your disadvantage","there are two distinct viewpoints in every republic: that of the populace and that of the elite. All the laws made in order to foster liberty result from the tensions between them,","good individuals cannot exist without good education, and good education cannot exist without good laws,","...instead of praying for some new holy man to save you, learn the way to Hell in order to steer clear of it yourself.","He who believes that new benefits will cause great personages to forget old injuries is deceived.","... The armour of others is too wide, or too strait for us; it falls off us, or it weighs us down.","Upon this, one has to remark that men ought either to be well treated or crushed, because they can avenge themselves of lighter injuries, of more serious ones they cannot; therefore the injury that is to be done to a man ought to be of such a kind that one does not stand in fear of revenge. But","Nothing consumes itself so much as generosity, because while you practise it you\u2019re losing the wherewithal to go on practising it.","Let no man marvel if in what I am about to say concerning Princedoms wholly new, both as regards the Prince and the form of Government, I cite the highest examples. For since men for the most part follow in the footsteps and imitate the actions of others, and yet are unable to adhere exactly to those paths which others have taken, or attain to the virtues of those whom they would resemble, the wise man should always follow the roads that have been trodden by the great, and imitate those who have most excelled, so that if he cannot reach their perfection, he may at least acquire something of its savour. Acting in this like the skilful archer, who seeing that the object he would hit is distant, and knowing the range of his bow, takes aim much above the destined mark; not designing that his arrow should strike so high, but that flying high it may alight at the point intended.","A Prince is likewise esteemed who is a stanch friend and a thorough foe, that is to say, who without reserve openly declares for one against another, this being always a more advantageous course than to stand neutral. For supposing two of your powerful neighbours come to blows, it must either be that you have, or have not, reason to fear the one who comes off victorious. In either case it will always be well for you to declare yourself, and join in frankly with one side or other. For should you fail to do so you are certain, in the former of the cases put, to become the prey of the victor to the satisfaction and delight of the vanquished, and no reason or circumstance that you may plead will avail to shield or shelter you; for the victor dislikes doubtful friends, and such as will not help him at a pinch; and the vanquished will have nothing to say to you, since you would not share his fortunes sword in hand.","Upon this a question arises: whether it be better to be loved than feared or feared than loved? It may be answered that one should wish to be both, but, because it is difficult to unite them in one person, is much safer to be feared than loved, when, of the two, either must be dispensed with.","And since there are three scales of intelligence, one which understands by itself, a second which understands what is shown it by others, and a third which understands neither by itself nor on the showing of others, the first of which is most excellent, the second good, but the third worthless,","Thus it will always happen that he who is not your friend will demand your neutrality, whilst he who is your friend will entreat you to declare yourself with arms.","And it will always happen that he who is not your friend will invite you to neutrality, while he who is your friend will call on you to declare yourself openly in arms.","In this passage we are taught how hateful a thing is calumny in all free States, as, indeed, in every society, and how we must neglect no means which may serve to check it. And there can be no more effectual means for checking calumny than by affording ample facilities for impeachment, which is as useful in a commonwealth as the other is pernicious. And between them there is this difference, that calumny needs neither witness, nor circumstantial proof to establish it, so that any man may be calumniated by any other; but not impeached; since impeachment demands that there be substantive charges made, and trustworthy evidence to support them.","Those who believe that where great personages are concerned new favors cause old injuries to be forgotten deceive themselves.","He who is the cause of another\u2019s greatness is himself undone, since he must work either by address or force, each of which excites distrust in the person raised to power.","Again, a Prince should show himself a patron of merit, and should honour those who excel in every art. He ought accordingly to encourage his subjects by enabling them to pursue their callings, whether mercantile, agricultural, or any other, in security, so that this man shall not be deterred from beautifying his possessions from the apprehension that they may be taken from him, or that other refrain from opening a trade through fear of taxes; and he should provide rewards for those who desire so to employ themselves, and for all who are disposed in any way to add to the greatness of his City or State.","Anyone who studies present and ancient affairs will easily see how in all cities and all peoples there still exist, and have always existed, the same desires and passions. Thus, it is an easy matter for him who carefully examines past events to foresee future events in a republic and to apply the remedies employed by the ancients, or, if old remedies cannot be found, to devise new ones based upon the similarity of the events. But since these matters are neglected or not understood by those who read, or, if understood, remain unknown to those who govern, the result is that the same problems always exist in every era.","... He who innovates will have for his enemies all those who are well off under the existing order of things, and only lukewarm supporters in those who might be better off under the new... partly from the incredulity of mankind, who will never admit the merit of anything new, until they have seen it proved by the event.","This lukewarm temper arises partly from the fear of adversaries who have the laws on their side, and partly from the incredulity of mankind, who will never admit the merit of anything new, until they have seen it proved by the event. The result, however, is that whenever the enemies of change make an attack, they do so with all the zeal of partisans, while the others defend themselves so feebly as to endanger both themselves and their cause.","The Romans, accordingly, admiring the prudence and virtues of Numa, assented to all the measures which he recommended. This, however, is to be said, that the circumstance of these times being deeply tinctured with religious feeling, and of the men with whom he had to deal being rude and ignorant, gave Numa better facility to carry out his plans, as enabling him to mould his subjects readily to any new impression. And, doubtless, he who should seek at the present day to form a new commonwealth, would find the task easier among a race of simple mountaineers, than among the dwellers in cities where society is corrupt; as the sculptor can more easily carve a fair statue from a rough block, than from the block which has been badly shaped out by another.","He listened to their opinions, stated his own, and supported them with reasons; and from his being constantly occupied with such meditations, it resulted, that when in command no complication could ever present itself with which he was not prepared to deal.","Therefore, my son, if you wish to please me, and to bring success and honour to yourself, do right and study, because others will help you if you help yourself.","So to hold it they were compelled to dismantle many cities in the country, for in truth there is no safe way to retain them otherwise than by ruining them. And he who becomes master of a city accustomed to freedom and does not destroy it, may expect to be destroyed by it, for in rebellion it has always the watchword of liberty and its ancient privileges as a rallying point, which neither time nor benefits will ever cause it to forget. And whatever you may do or provide against, they never forget that name or their privileges unless they are disunited or dispersed, but at every chance they immediately rally to them,","Men are either to be kindly treated, or utterly crushed, since they can revenge lighter injuries, but not graver. Wherefore the injury we do to a man should be of a sort to leave no fear of reprisals.","When evening comes, I go back home, and go to my study. On the threshold I take off my work clothes, covered in mud and filth, and put on the clothes an ambassador would wear. Decently dressed, I enter the ancient courts of rulers who have long since died. There I am warmly welcomed, and I feed on the only food I find nourishing, and was born to savor. I am not ashamed to talk to them, and to ask them to explain their actions. And they, out of kindness, answer me. Four hours go by without my feeling any anxiety. I forget every worry. I am no longer afraid of poverty, or frightened of death. I live entirely through them.","that men, thinking to better their condition, are always ready to change masters, and in this expectation will take up arms against any ruler; wherein they deceive themselves, and find afterwards by experience that they are worse off than before.","At nightfall I return home and enter my study. There on the threshold I remove my dirty, mud-spattered clothes, slip on my regal and courtly robes, and thus fittingly attired, I enter the ancient courts of bygone men where, having received a friendly welcome, I feed on the food that is mine alone and that I was born for. I am not ashamed to speak with them and inquire into the reasons for their actions; and they answer me in kindly fashion. And so for four hours I feel no annoyance; I forget all troubles; poverty hold no fears, and death loses its terrors. I become entirely one of them.","It may be observed, that provinces amid the vicissitudes to which they are subject, pass from order into confusion, and afterward recur to a state of order again; for the nature of mundane affairs not allowing them to continue in an even course, when they have arrived at their greatest perfection, they soon begin to decline. In the same manner, having been reduced by disorder, and sunk to their utmost state of depression, unable to descend lower, they, of necessity, reascend; and thus from good they gradually decline to evil, and from evil again return to good. The reason is, that valor produces peace; peace, repose; repose, disorder; disorder, ruin; so from disorder order springs; from order virtue, and from this, glory and good fortune.","If they lacked the opportunity, the strength of their sprit would have been sapped; if they had lacked ability, the opportunity would have been wasted.","...the scepticism of men, who do not truly believe in new things unless they have actually had personal experience of them.","... Physicians tell us of hectic fever, that in its beginning it is easy to cure, but hard to recognize; whereas, after a time, not having been detected and treated at the first, it becomes easy to recognize but impossible to cure. And so it is with State affairs.","A wise man ought always to follow the paths beaten by great men, and to imitate those who have been supreme, so that if his ability does not equal theirs, at least it will savour of it.","... If in other respects the old condition of things be continued, and there be no discordance in their customs, men live peaceably with one another...","Princes should devolve on others those matters that entail responsibility, and reserve to themselves those that relate to grace and favour.","...

War is the sole art looked for in one who rules...","It is better to be feared than loved if you cannot be both.","From this one can derive a general rule which rarely, if ever, fails: that anyone who is the cause of another becoming powerful comes to ruin himself; because that power has been brought about by him either through cunning or by force; and both of these two qualities are suspect to the one who has become powerful.","Men will not look at things as they really are, but as they wish them to be\u2014 and are ruined.","And although one should not reason about Moses, as he was a mere executor of things that had been ordered for him by God, nonetheless he should be admired if only for that grace which made him deserving of speaking with God.","And it ought to be remembered that there is nothing more difficult to take in hand, more perilous to conduct, or more uncertain in its success, than to take the lead in the introduction of a new order of things, because the innovator has for enemies all those who have done well under the old conditions, and lukewarm defenders in those who may do well under the new.","Those who solely by good fortune become princes from being private citizens have little trouble in rising, but much in keeping atop; they have not any difficulties on the way up because they fly, but they have many when they reach the summit.","Mercenaries and auxiliaries are useless and dangerous; and if one holds his state based on these arms, he will stand neither firm nor safe; for they are disunited, ambitious, and without discipline, unfaithful, valiant before friends, cowardly before enemies; they have neither the fear of God nor fidelity to men, and destruction is deferred only so long as the attack is; for in peace one is robbed by them, and in war by the enemy.","The innovator makes enemies of all those who prospered under the old order, and only lukewarm support is forthcoming from those who would prosper under the new.","resemblance between Fortune and women and concludes that it is the bold rather than the cautious man that will win and hold them both.","When a newly acquired State has been accustomed, as I have said, to live under its own laws and in freedom, there are three methods whereby it may be held. The first is to destroy it; the second, to go and reside there in person; the third, to suffer it to live on under its own laws, subjecting it to a tribute, and entrusting its government to a few of the inhabitants who will keep the rest your friends","But since a Prince should know how to use the beast\u2019s nature wisely, he ought of beasts to choose both the lion and the fox; for the lion cannot guard himself from the toils, nor the fox from wolves. He must therefore be a fox to discern toils, and a lion to drive off wolves.","And it has always been the opinion and judgment of wise men that nothing can be so uncertain or unstable as fame or power not founded on its own strength.","A PRINCE, therefore, should have no care or thought but for war, and for the regulations and training it requires, and should apply himself exclusively to this as his peculiar province; for war is the sole art looked for in one who rules, and is of such efficacy that it not merely maintains those who are born Princes, but often enables men to rise to that eminence from a private station;","Wherefore, as has already been said, a Prince who is ignorant of military affairs, besides other disadvantages, can neither be respected by his soldiers, nor can he trust them.","No es preciso que un pr\xedncipe posea todas las virtudes citadas, pero es indispensable que aparente poseerlas","One should bear in mind that there is nothing more difficult to execute, nor more dubious of success, nor more dangerous to administer, than to introduce new political orders. For the one who introduces them has as his enemies all those who profit from the old order, and he has only lukewarm defenders in all those who might profit from the new order.","Time sweeps everything along and can bring good as well as evil, evil as well as good.","I say, then, that hereditary States, accustomed to the family of their Prince, are maintained with far less difficulty than new States, since all that is required is that the Prince shall not depart from the usages of his ancestors, trusting for the rest to deal with events as they arise. So that if an hereditary Prince be of average address, he will always maintain himself in his Princedom, unless deprived of it by some extraordinary and irresistible force; and even if so deprived will recover it, should any, even the least, mishap overtake the usurper. We have in Italy an example of this in the Duke of Ferrara, who never could have withstood the attacks of the Venetians in 1484, nor those of Pope Julius in 1510, had not his authority in that State been consolidated by time. For since a Prince by birth has fewer occasions and less need to give offence, he ought to be better loved, and will naturally be popular with his subjects unless outrageous vices make him odious. Moreover, the very antiquity and continuance of his rule will efface the memories and causes which lead to innovation. For one change always leaves a dovetail into which another will fit.","Wherefore, unless things be put on a sound footing by some one ruler who lives to a very advanced age, or by two virtuous rulers succeeding one another, the city upon their death at once falls back into ruin; or, if it be preserved, must be so by incurring great risks, and at the cost of much blood. For","For, besides what has been said, people are fickle by nature: it is easy to convince them of something, but difficult to hold them in that conviction. Therefore, affairs should be managed in such a way that when they no longer believe, they can be made to believe by force.","Concerning this, it should be noted that men must be either caressed or wiped out; because they will avenge minor injuries, but cannot do so for grave ones. Any harm done to a man must be of the kind that removes any fear of revenge.","Many, Lorenzo, have held and still hold the opinion, that there is nothing which has less in common with another, and that is so dissimilar, as civilian life is from the military. Whence it is often observed, if anyone designs to avail himself of an enlistment in the army, that he soon changes, not only his clothes, but also his customs, his habits, his voice, and in the presence of any civilian custom, he goes to pieces; for I do not believe that any man can dress in civilian clothes who wants to be quick and ready for any violence; nor can that man have civilian customs and habits, who judges those customs to be effeminate and those habits not conducive to his actions; nor does it seem right to him to maintain his ordinary appearance and voice who, with his beard and cursing, wants to make other men afraid: which makes such an opinion in these times to be very true. But if they should consider the ancient institutions, they would not find matter more united, more in conformity, and which, of necessity, should be like to each other as much as these (civilian and military); for in all the arts that are established in a society for the sake of the common good of men, all those institutions created to (make people) live in fear of the laws and of God would be in vain, if their defense had not been provided for and which, if well arranged, will maintain not only these, but also those that are not well established. And so (on the contrary), good institutions without the help of the military are not much differently disordered than the habitation of a superb and regal palace, which, even though adorned with jewels and gold, if it is not roofed over will not have anything to protect it from the rain. And, if in any other institutions of a City and of a Republic every diligence is employed in keeping men loyal, peaceful, and full of the fear of God, it is doubled in the military; for in what man ought the country look for greater loyalty than in that man who has to promise to die for her? In whom ought there to be a greater love of peace, than in him who can only be injured by war? In whom ought there to be a greater fear of God than in him who, undergoing infinite dangers every day, has more need for His aid? If these necessities in forming the life of the soldier are well considered, they are found to be praised by those who gave the laws to the Commanders and by those who were put in charge of military training, and followed and imitated with all diligence by others.","Pu\u0163ini v\u0103d cum suntem \xeentr-adev\u0103r, dar to\u0163i v\u0103d ce ne prefacem c\u0103 suntem.","The evening being come, I return home and go to my study; at the entrance I pull off my peasant-clothes, covered with dust and dirt, and put on my noble court dress, and thus becomingly re-clothed I pass into the ancient courts of the men of old, where, being lovingly received by them, I am fed with that food which is mine alone; where I do not hesitate to speak with them, and to ask for the reason of their actions, and they in their benignity answer me; and for four hours I feel no weariness, I forget every trouble, poverty does not dismay, death does not terrify me; I am possessed entirely by those great men.","Men in general judge more with the eye than with the hand, because everyone can see, but few can feel.

For with contempt on one side, and distrust on the other, it is impossible that men should work well together.","Whoever desires constant success must change his conduct with the times.","Therefore it must be inferred that good counsels, whencesoever they come, are born of the wisdom of the prince, and not the wisdom of the prince from good counsels.","I say then that such a principality is obtained either by the favour of the people or by the favour of the nobles. Because in all cities, these two distinct parties are found, and from this it arises that the people do not wish to be ruled nor oppressed by the nobles, and the nobles wish to rule and oppress the people; and from these two opposite desires there arises in cities one of three results, either a principality, self-government, or anarchy.","[As to the second case] ,that of being drawn into one [a trap or ambush] ...you must be shrewd about not believing easily things not in accord with reason. For example, if the enemy puts some booty before you, you ought to believe that within it there is a hook and that it conceals some trick. If many of the enemy are put to flight by your few, if a few of the enemy assail your many, if the enemy turn in sudden flight,...you ought to fear a trick.

In either case it will always be more advantageous for you to declare yourself and to make war strenuously; because, in the first case, if you do not declare yourself, you will invariably fall a prey to the conqueror, to the pleasure and satisfaction of him who has been conquered, and you will have no reasons to offer, nor anything to protect or to shelter you. Because he who conquers does not want doubtful friends who will not aid him in the time of trial; and he who loses will not harbour you because you did not willingly, sword in hand, court his fate.","They were freer than their forefathers in dress and living, and spent more in other kinds of excesses, consuming their time and money in idleness, gaming, and women; their chief aim was to appear well dressed and to speak with wit and acuteness, whilst he who could wound others the most cleverly was thought the wisest.\\" In","For since a Prince by birth has fewer occasions and less need to give offence, he ought to be better loved, and will naturally be popular with his subjects unless outrageous vices make him odious.","no principality is secure without having its own forces;","Differences between the conduct of the multitude and the conduct of the princes do not derive from differences in their nature, that being the same in both (though if there be some superiority either way, it will be found on the side of the people); rather, they derive from differences in their respect for the laws under which they live.","From this arises an argument: whether it is better to be loved than feared. I reply that one should like to be both one and the other; but since it is difficult to join them together, it is much safer to be feared than to be loved when one of the two must be lacking.","[...T]he ways of God have been manifested beyond example: the sea is divided, the cloud has led the way, the rock has poured forth water, it has rained manna, everything has contributed to your greatness; you ought to do the rest.

And so much the more is this experiment dangerous, inasmuch as it can only be tried once. Therefore, a wise prince ought to adopt such a course that his citizens will always in every sort and kind of circumstance have need of the state and of him, and then he will always find them faithful.","IT IS customary for such as seek a Prince\u2019s favour, to present themselves before him with those things of theirs which they themselves most value, or in which they perceive him chiefly to delight.","Therefore, he who considers it necessary to secure himself in his new principality, to win friends, to overcome either by force or fraud, to make himself beloved and feared by the people, to be followed and revered by the soldiers, to exterminate those who have power or reason to hurt him, to change the old order of things for new, to be severe and gracious, magnanimous and liberal, to destroy a disloyal soldiery and to create new, to maintain friendship with kings and princes in such a way that they must help him with zeal and offend with caution, cannot find a more lively example than the actions of this man.","The nature of men is such that they find themselves obligated as much for the benefits they confer as for those they receive.","the best possible fortress is\u2014not to be hated by the people","One who begins to live by rapine will always find some reason for taking the goods of others","It was necessary, therefore, to Moses that he should find the people of Israel in Egypt enslaved and oppressed by the Egyptians, in order that they should be disposed to follow him so as to be delivered out of bondage.

For this, inhuman cruelty was wholly responsible. It was this, along with his countless other qualities, which made him feared and respected by his soldiers. If it had not been for his cruelty, his other qualities would not have been enough. The historians, having given little thought to this, on the one hand admire what Hannibal achieved, and on the other condemn what made his achievements possible.","These reflections prompt the question: is it better to be loved rather than feared, or vice versa?

And hence it comes, as I have already said, that two operating differently arrive at the same result, and two operating similarly, the one succeeds and the other not.

And if this opinion of theirs is false, as it is most of the time, I am persuaded that there are various causes that lead them into this deception.","a veces, lo que parece virtud es causa de ruina, y lo que parece vicio solo acaba por traer el bienestar y la seguridad.","Those princes or republics that wish to maintain their integrity must, above all else, maintain the integrity of their religious ceremonies, and must always hold them in veneration, because there can be no greater indication of the ruin of a state than to see a disregard for its divine worship.","men, walking almost always in paths beaten by others, and following by imitation their deeds, are yet unable to keep entirely to the ways of others or attain to the power of those they imitate.","the authority that is seized by violence, not that given by votes, harms republics.2 In","because friendships that are obtained by payments, and not by greatness or nobility of mind, may indeed be earned, but they are not secured, and in time of need cannot be relied upon; and men have less scruple in offending one who is beloved than one who is feared, for love is preserved by the link of obligation which, owing to the baseness of men, is broken at every opportunity for their advantage; but fear preserves you by a dread of punishment which never fails.","it is necessary to be a fox to discover the snares and a lion to terrify the wolves.","It should be borne in mind that there is nothing more difficult to handle, more doubtful of success, and more dangerous to carry through than initiating changes in a state\'s constitution. The innovator makes enemies of all those who prospered under the old order, and only lukewarm support is forthcoming from those who would prosper under the new.","In The Prince Machiavelli mounts two distinct lines of intellectual and political attack, one against the baseness of Medicean statecraft, the other against the too-strict Ciceronian conception of politics. Against both traditions, he elaborates a new \u2018art of the state\u2019. He openly declares himself to be an expert in this art.","But the difficulties occur in a new principality. And firstly, if it be not entirely new, but is, as it were, a member of a state which, taken collectively, may be called composite, the changes arise chiefly from an inherent difficulty which there is in all new principalities; for men change their rulers willingly, hoping to better themselves, and this hope induces them to take up arms against him who rules: wherein they are deceived, because they afterwards find by experience they have gone from bad to worse.","In this way you have enemies in all those whom you have injured in seizing that principality, and you are not able to keep those friends who put you there because of your not being able to satisfy them in the way they expected, and you cannot take strong measures against them, feeling bound to them.","Nicia: God send him the plague!Timoteo: Why?Nicia: So he\'ll get it!","offence, since you show your subjects that you distrust them, either as doubting their courage, or as doubting their fidelity, each of which imputations begets hatred against you.","But when states are acquired in a country differing in language, customs, or laws, there are difficulties, and good fortune and great energy are needed to hold them, and one of the greatest and most real helps would be that he who has acquired them should go and reside there.","If a prince wants to keep up a reputation for being generous, Machiavelli remarks: it is necessary for him not to neglect any possible means of sumptuous display; in so doing, such a prince will always use up all his resources in such displays and will be eventually obliged, if he wishes to maintain his reputation for generosity, to burden the people with excessive taxes and to do all those things one does to procure money. This will begin to make him hateful to his subjects and, if he becomes impoverished, he will be held in low regard by everyone. (Ch. XVI)","He has only to take care that they do not get hold of too much power and too much authority, and then with his own forces, and with their goodwill, he can easily keep down the more powerful of them, so as to remain entirely master in the country.","it is necessary for you to study; since, then, you have no longer the excuse of illness, take pains to study letters and music, for you see what honour is done to me for the little skill I have. Therefore, my son, if you wish to please me, and to bring success and honour to yourself, do right and study, because others will help you if you help yourself.","for men change their rulers willingly, hoping to better themselves, and this hope induces them to take up arms against him who rules: wherein they are deceived, because they afterwards find by experience they have gone from bad to worse.","But when they had to form a particular judgment on the men of their own party, they recognized their defects, and decided that individually no one of them was deserving of what, collectively, they seemed entitled to; and being ashamed of them, turned to bestow their honours on those who deserved them. Of","From this a general rule is drawn, which never or rarely fails: that he who is the cause of another becoming powerful is ruined because that predominance has been brought about either by astuteness or else by force, and both are distrusted by him who has been raised to power.","in the beginning of the malady it is easy to cure but difficult to detect, but in the course of time, not having been either detected or treated in the beginning, it becomes easy to detect but difficult to cure. This it happens in affairs of state, for when the evils that arise have been foreseen (which it is only given to a wise man to see), they can be quickly redressed, but when, through not having been foreseen, they have been permitted to grow in a way that everyone can see them, there is no longer a remedy.","moral that it is far better to earn the confidence of the people than to rely on fortresses.","And although it appears that the World has become effeminate and Heaven disarmed, yet this arises without doubt more from the baseness of men who have interpreted our Religion in accordance with Indolence and not in accordance with Virtu. For if they were to consider that it (our Religion) permits the exaltation and defense of the country, they would see that it desires that we love and honor her (our country), and that we prepare ourselves so that we can be able to defend her.","Without doubt, princes become great when they overcome the difficulties and obstacles by which they are confronted, and therefore fortune, especially when she desires to make a new prince great, who has a greater necessity to earn renown than an hereditary one, causes enemies to arise and form designs against him, in order that he may have the opportunity of overcoming them, and by them to mount higher, as by a ladder which his enemies have raised. For this reason, many consider that a wise prince, when he has the opportunity, ought with craft to foster some animosity against himself so that, having crushed it, his renown may rise higher.","Great ambition is the passion of a great character. Those endowed with it may perform very good or very bad acts. All depends on the principles which direct them.","The wish to acquire is in truth very natural and common, and men always do so when they can, and for this they will be praised not blamed; but when they cannot do so, yet wish to do so by any means, then there is folly and blame.","a prince, so long as he keeps his subjects united and loyal, ought not to mind the reproach of cruelty; because with a few examples he will be more merciful than those who, through too much mercy, allow disorders to arise, from which follow murders or robberies; for these are wont to injure the whole people, whilst those executions which originate with a prince offend the individual only.","I consider that it is better to be adventurous than cautious, because fortune is a woman, and if you wish to keep her under it is necessary to beat and ill-use her; and it is seen that she allows herself to be mastered by the adventurous rather than by those who go to work more coldly. She is, therefore, always, woman-like, a lover of young men, because they are less cautious, more violent, and with more audacity command her.","We\u2019re all players in a game. You\u2019re a player or a piece on the board, you move or you\u2019re moved. You play the game or the game plays you.","It is necessary\u2019, he writes, for a prince to learn \u2018how not to be good\u2019 (Ch. XV). Machiavelli\u2019s wording on this matter is extremely precise: a man who wants \u2018to profess goodness at all times\u2019 will inevitably fail because he is surrounded by many unscrupulous men. Hence, \u2018it is necessary for a prince who wishes to maintain himself to learn how not to be good, and to use this knowledge or not to use it according to necessity\u2019 (Ch. XV).","this is to be asserted in general of men, that they are ungrateful, fickle, false, cowardly, covetous, and as long as you succeed they are yours entirely; they will offer you their blood, property, life, and children, as is said above, when the need is far distant; but when it approaches they turn against you.

Hence, if a ruler wants to survive, he\u2019ll have to learn to stop being good, at least when the occasion demands.","for it was a hard thing to give satisfaction both to soldiers and people because the people loved peace, and for this reason they loved the unaspiring prince, while the soldiers loved the warlike prince who was bold, cruel, and rapacious, which qualities they were quite willing he should exercise upon the people so that they could get double pay and give vent to their own greed and cruelty. Hence it arose that those emperors were always overthrown who, either by birth or training, had no great authority, and most of them, especially those who came new to the principality, recognizing the difficulty of these two opposing humours, were inclined to give satisfaction to the soldiers, caring little about injuring the people. Which course was necessary because, as princes cannot help being hated by someone, they ought, in the first place, to avoid being hated by everyone, and when they cannot compass this, they ought to endeavour with the utmost diligence to avoid the hatred of the most powerful. Therefore, those emperors who through inexperience had need of special favour adhered more readily to the soldiers than to the people, a course which turned out advantageous to them or not, accordingly as the prince knew how to maintain authority over them.","Concluyo, pues, volvie\xf1do a lo de ser temido y amado, que, dado que los hombres aman cuando es su voluntad y temen seg\xfan la voluntad del pr\xedncipe, un pr\xedncipe sabio debe apoyarse en lo que es suyo y no en lo que es de otros; tan s\xf3lo debe ingeni\xe1rselas, como he dicho, para evitar el odio.","Deb\xe9is, pues, saber que hay dos formas de combatir: una con las leyes, otra con la fuerza. La primera es propia del hombre, la segunda de las bestias. Pero como muchas veces no basta la primera, conviene recurrir a la segunda.","Machiavelli moralizes on the resemblance between Fortune and women, and concludes that it is the bold rather than the cautious man that will win and hold them both.","These reflections prompt the question: is it better to be loved rather than feared, or vice versa? The answer is that one would prefer to be both but, since they don\u2019t go together easily, if you have to choose, it\u2019s much safer to be feared than loved. We can say this of most people: that they are ungrateful and unreliable; they lie, they fake, they\u2019re greedy for cash and they melt away in the face of danger. So long as you\u2019re generous and, as I said before, not in immediate danger, they\u2019re all on your side: they\u2019d shed their blood for you, they\u2019d give you their belongings, their lives, their children. But when you need them they turn their backs on you. The ruler who has relied entirely on their promises and taken no other precautions is lost. Friendship that comes at a price, and not because people admire your spirit and achievements, may indeed have been paid for, but that doesn\u2019t mean you really possess it and you certainly won\u2019t be able to count on it when you need it. Men are less worried about letting down someone who has made himself loved than someone who makes himself feared. Love binds when someone recognizes he should be grateful to you, but, since men are a sad lot, gratitude is forgotten the moment it\u2019s inconvenient. Fear means fear of punishment, and that\u2019s something people never forget.","All the same, while a ruler can\u2019t expect to inspire love when making himself feared, he must avoid arousing hatred. Actually, being feared is perfectly compatible with not being hated. And a ruler won\u2019t be hated if he keeps his hands off his subjects\u2019 property and their women. If he really has to have someone executed, he should only do it when he has proper justification and manifest cause. Above all, he mustn\u2019t seize other people\u2019s property. A man will sooner forget the death of his father than the loss of his inheritance. Of course there are always reasons for taking people\u2019s property and a ruler who has started to live that way will never be short of pretexts for grabbing more. On the other hand, reasons for executing a man come more rarely and pass more quickly.","Dante says: \xa0Knowledge doth come of learning well retained, \xa0 Unfruitful else,","Cualquiera que crea que los nuevos beneficios hacen olvidar a los eminentes personajes las antiguas injurias, camina","el que ayuda a otro a hacerse poderoso causa su propiaruina. Porque es natural que el que se ha vuelto poderoso recele de la misma astucia o de la misma fuerza gracias a las cuales se lo ha ayudado.","How we live is so difference than how we ought to live that he who studies what ought to be done rather than what is done will learn the way to his downfall rather than to his preservation. The Prince.","an able statesman out of work, like a huge whale, will endeavour to overturn the ship unless he has an empty cask to play with.","Quod nihil sit tam infirmum aut instaible quam fama potentiae non sua vi nixa.\'\'\'\'Hi\xe7bir \u015fey; kendi g\xfcc\xfcne dayanmayan bir iktidar\u0131n \xfcn\xfc kadar zay\u0131f ve de\u011fi\u015fken de\u011fildir.","Going back, then, to the question of being feared or loved, my conclusion is that since people decide for themselves whether to love a ruler or not, while it\u2019s the ruler who decides whether they\u2019re going to fear him, a sensible man will base his power on what he controls, not on what others have freedom to choose. But he must take care, as I said, that people don\u2019t come to hate him.","Since a ruler has to be able to act the beast, he should take on the traits of the fox and the lion; the lion can\u2019t defend itself against snares and the fox can\u2019t defend itself from wolves. So you have to play the fox to see the snares and the lion to scare off the wolves. A ruler who just plays the lion and forgets the fox doesn\u2019t know what he\u2019s doing. Hence a sensible leader cannot and must not keep his word if by doing so he puts himself at risk, and if the reasons that made him give his word in the first place are no longer valid. If all men were good, this would be bad advice, but since they are a sad lot and won\u2019t be keeping their promises to you, you hardly need to keep yours to them. Anyway, a ruler will never be short of good reasons to explain away a broken promise. It would be easy to cite any number of examples from modern times to show just how many peace treaties and other commitments have been rendered null and void by rulers not keeping their word. Those best at playing the fox have done better than the others. But you have to know how to disguise your slyness, how to pretend one thing and cover up another.

I\u2019ll go so far as to say this: if he had those qualities and observed them all the time, he\u2019d be putting himself at risk. It\u2019s seeming to be virtuous that helps; as, for example, seeming to be compassionate, loyal, humane, honest and religious. And you can even be those things, so long as you\u2019re always mentally prepared to change as soon as your interests are threatened. What you have to understand is that a ruler, especially a ruler new to power, can\u2019t always behave in ways that would make people think a man good, because to stay in power he\u2019s frequently obliged to act against loyalty, against charity, against humanity and against religion. What matters is that he has the sort of character that can change tack as luck and circumstances demand, and, as I\u2019ve already said, stick to the good if he can but know how to be bad when the occasion demands. So a ruler must be extremely careful not to say anything that doesn\u2019t appear to be inspired by the five virtues listed above; he must seem and sound wholly compassionate, wholly loyal, wholly humane, wholly honest and wholly religious. There is nothing more important than appearing to be religious. In general people judge more by appearances than first-hand experience, because everyone gets to see you but hardly anyone deals with you directly. Everyone sees what you seem to be, few have experience of who you really are, and those few won\u2019t have the courage to stand up to majority opinion underwritten by the authority of state","Por tanto, a un pr\xedncipe le es necesario saber utilizar correctamente a la bestia y al hombre. Este detalle se lo ense\xf1aron veladamente a los pr\xedncipes los escritores antiguos, que cuentan c\xf3mo Aquiles y otros muchos pr\xedncipes antiguos fueron entregados al centauro Quir\xf3n para que los educara bajo su disciplina. El tener como preceptor a alguien mitad animal y mitad hombre no quiere decir otra cosa que un pr\xedncipe necesita saber usar una y otra naturaleza, y que la una no perdura sin la otra.As\xed pues, dado que el pr\xedncipe necesita saber usar correctamente a la bestia, debe elegir de entre ellas a la zorra y al le\xf3n, porque el le\xf3n no sabe defenderse de las trampas ni la zorra de los lobos. Necesita, pues, ser zorra para reconocer las trampas y le\xf3n para asustar a los lobos. Los que s\xf3lo imitan al le\xf3n no saben lo que hacen. Por tanto, un se\xf1or prudente no puede ni debe mantener la palabra dada cuando eso se vuelva en su contra y hayan desaparecido los motivos que le llevaron a hacer la promesa.","Bien s\xfbr, on ne peut nommer valeur le fait de tuer les citoyens de sa patrie, de trahir ses amis, d\'\xeatre parjure, impitoyable et impie ; ces mani\xe8res de faire peuvent donner du pouvoir, mais non de la gloire.","When they\u2019re weighing up what someone has achieved - and this is particularly true with rulers, who can\u2019t be held to account - people look at the end result. So if a leader does what it takes to win power and keep it, his methods will always be reckoned honourable and widely praised. The crowd is won over by appearances and final results. And the world is all crowd: the dissenting few find no space so long as the majority have any grounds at all for their opinions.","And he who becomes master of a city accustomed to freedom and does not destroy it, may expect to be destroyed by it, for in rebellion it has always the watchword of liberty and its ancient privileges as a rallying point, which neither time nor benefits will ever cause it to forget.","men ought either to be well treated or crushed, because they can avenge themselves of lighter injuries, of more serious ones they cannot; therefore the injury that is to be done to a man ought to be of such a kind that one does not stand in fear of revenge. But in maintaining armed men there in place of colonies one spends much more, having to consume on the garrison all the income from the state, so that the acquisition turns into a loss, and many more are exasperated, because the whole state is injured; through the shifting of the garrison up and down all become acquainted with hardship, and all become hostile, and they are enemies who, whilst beaten on their own ground, are yet able to do hurt. For every reason, therefore, such guards are as useless as a colony is useful. Again, the prince who holds a country differing in the above respects ought to make himself the head and defender of his less powerful neighbours, and to weaken the more powerful amongst them, taking care that no foreigner as powerful as himself shall, by any accident, get a footing there; for it will always happen that such a one will be introduced by those who are discontented, either through excess of ambition or through fear, as one has seen already. The Romans were brought into Greece by the Aetolians; and in every other country where they obtained a footing they were brought in by the inhabitants.","M\u0105dry pan nie mo\u017ce ani nie powinien dotrzymywa\u0107 wiary, je\u017celi takie dotrzymywanie przynosi mu szkod\u0119 i gdy znikn\u0119\u0142y jego przyczyny, kt\xf3re spowodowa\u0142y jego przyrzeczenie.

The people, finding they cannot resist the nobles, also cry up the reputation of one of themselves, and make him a prince so as to be defended by his authority.","[...] e que se fa\xe7a como os arqueiros sensatos, os quais, diante de um alvo demasiado distante, e conhecendo at\xe9 onde vai a pot\xeancia de seu arco, al\xe7am a mira muito mais alta que o ponto de destino, n\xe3o para alcan\xe7ar com suas flechas tanta altura, mas para poder, com o aux\xedlio de t\xe3o alta mira, atingir sua meta.","Por otro lado, aqu\xed se inicia el proceso de personificaci\xf3n del Estado que m\xe1s tarde desarrollar\xe1 Hobbes: el Estado representa los intereses del todo y, en aras de la preservaci\xf3n de los mismos, emite normas para regular las acciones externas entre los individuos que interact\xfaan socialmente.","Si los hombres fueran todos buenos, no lo ser\xeda este precepto, pero como son malvados y no te guardan la palabra dada, t\xfa tampoco tienes por qu\xe9 mantenerla con ellos. Adem\xe1s, jam\xe1s le faltaron a un pr\xedncipe razones leg\xedtimas para disfrazar su incumplimiento. De esto sepodr\xedan dar infinitos ejemplos modernos y mostrar cu\xe1ntas paces, cu\xe1ntas promesas han resultado in\xfatiles y vanas por la infidelidad de los pr\xedncipes; y el que mejor ha sabido hacer de zorra ha salido mejor librado. Pero es necesario saber disfrazar bien esta naturaleza y ser un gran simulador y disimulador; y los hombres son tan simples y obedecen tanto a las necesidades del momento que el que enga\xf1a encontrar\xe1 siempre quien se deje enga\xf1ar.No quiero callar uno de los ejemplos m\xe1s recientes. Alejandro VI no hizo ni pens\xf3 jam\xe1s en otra cosa que en enga\xf1ar a los hombres y siempre encontr\xf3 con quien poder hacerlo. Nunca hubo un hombre que aseverara con mayor eficacia ni que con mayores juramentos afirmara una cosa y menos la cumpliera; y a pesar de todo siempre le salieron los enga\xf1os seg\xfan sus deseos, porque conoc\xeda bien este lado del mundo.Por tanto, un pr\xedncipe no necesita poseer de hecho todas las cualidades antes mencionadas, pero es muy necesario que parezca que las tiene. M\xe1s a\xfan, me atrever\xe9 a decir esto: que son perjudiciales si las tiene y las observa siempre, pero son \xfatiles si aparenta tenerlas. Es decir, parecer compasivo, fiel, humano, \xedntegro, religioso, y serlo; pero estar con el \xe1nimo dispuesto de tal manera que, si es necesario no serlo, puedas y sepas pasar a ser lo contrario. Y es preciso saber que un pr\xedncipe, y m\xe1xime un pr\xedncipe nuevo, no puede observar todo aquello por lo que los hombres son considerados buenos, dado que, para conservar el Estado, a menudo necesita obrar contra la lealtad, contra la caridad, contra la humanidad, contra la religi\xf3n. Por eso necesita tener un \xe1nimo dispuesto a moverse seg\xfan se lo exijan los vientos de la fortuna y las variaciones de las cosas y, como he dicho antes, no alejarse del bien, si puede, pero saber entrar en el mal si es necesario.","Ksi\u0105\u017c\u0119 powinien, skoro ma po temu sposobno\u015b\u0107, podsyca\u0107 zr\u0119cznie jak\u0105\u015b nieprzyja\u017a\u0144 przeciwko sobie, aby sta\u0107 si\u0119 jeszcze wi\u0119kszym przez jej zgniecenie.","Hay tres modos de conservar un Estado que, antes de ser adquirido, estaba acostumbrado a regirse por sus propias leyes y a vivir en libertad: primero, destruirlo., despu\xe9s, radicarse en \xe9l; por \xfaltimo, dejarlo regir por sus leyes, obligarlo a pagar un tributo y establecer un gobierno compuesto por un corto n\xfamero de personas, para que se encargue de velar por la conquista.","Que pour \xeatre efficace, il faut cacher ses intentions.","Ksi\u0105\u017c\u0119ta, szczeg\xf3lnie za\u015b nowi, znajdowali wi\u0119cej wierno\u015bci i wi\u0119cej mieli po\u017cytku z tych ludzi, kt\xf3rych na pocz\u0105tku swych rz\u0105d\xf3w uwa\u017cali za podejrzanych","ALL STATES, ALL POWERS, THAT HAVE HELD AND HOLD RULE OVER MEN HAVE been and are either republics or principalities.","El mal no es un problema teol\xf3gico consecuencia de una hipot\xe9tica falta originaria; es un problema pol\xedticoconsecuencia del protagonismo de la ambici\xf3n como gu\xeda de las acciones de las criaturas humanas.

Y no hay cosa m\xe1s necesaria que debe aparentar poseer que esta \xfaltima cualidad.

A wise man ought always to follow the paths beaten by great men, and to imitate those who have been supreme, so that if his ability does not equal theirs, at least it will savour of it.","For since men who are well treated by one whom they expected to treat them ill, feel the more beholden to their benefactor, the people will at once become better disposed to such a Prince when he protects them, than if he owed his Princedom to them.","In short, with mercenaries your greatest danger is from their inertness and cowardice, with auxiliaries from their valour. Wise Princes, therefore, have always eschewed these arms, and trusted rather to their own, and have preferred defeat with the latter to victory with the former, counting that as no true victory which is gained by foreign aid.","Liberality exercised in a way that does not bring you the reputation for it, injures you; for if one exercises it honestly and as it should be exercised, it may not become known, and you will not avoid the reproach of its opposite.","Violence must be inflicted once for all, people will then forget what it tastes like and so be less resentful.","This is to be asserted in general of men, that they are ungrateful, fickle, false, cowardly, covetous, and as long as you succeed they are yours entirely; they will offer you blood, property, life, and children, as is said above, when the need is far distant; but when it approaches they turn against you.","Since any one who would act up to a perfect standard of goodness in everything, must be ruined among so many who are not good. It is essential, therefore, for a Prince who desires to maintain his position, to have learned how to be other than good, and to use or not to use his goodness as necessity requires.","Y es preciso saber que un pr\xedncipe, y m\xe1xime un pr\xedncipe nuevo, no puede observar todo aquello por lo que los hombres son considerados buenos, dado que, para conservar el Estado, a menudo necesita obrar contra la lealtad, contra la caridad, contra la humanidad, contra la religi\xf3n.

(p. 4)Como quiera que haya sido, lo cierto es que nadie probablemente ha sido, tanto como Maquiavelo, signo de contradicci\xf3n. Nadie ha tenido tan varia y tempestuosa fortuna, como suelen decir los italianos; y vale recordar algunas por lo menos de sus m\xe1s sonadas peripecias. (p. 11)Maquiavelo puede pasar casi como un santo. Que una u otra vez sacrific\xf3 en los altares de Afrodita (de la Pandemia siempre, porque fue var\xf3n a carta cabal), parece ser lo m\xe1s probable pero fueron pasiones o pasioncillas que no alteraron la paz de su hogar, ni sobrepusieron en modo alguno (la carta a Vettori lo est\xe1 diciendo) a su labor intelectual.

(p. 11)En la concepci\xf3n de Maquiavelo, el Pr\xedncipe es el Estado\u2026 En cuanto al pueblo, es algo que no ha podido definirse jam\xe1s. Como entidad pol\xedtica, es una entidad puramente abstracta. No se sabe exactamente ni d\xf3nde comienza ni d\xf3nde acaba. El adjetivo de soberano aplicado al pueblo es una farsa tr\xe1gica\u2026 Al pueblo no le queda ni un monos\xedlabo para afirmar y obedecer. (p. 15)En los Discursos sobre Tito Livio abundan declaraciones semejantes. \u201cHay que partir del presupuesto de que los hombres son todos perversos (tutti gli uomini rei), y que siempre que se les presente ocasi\xf3n, har\xe1n uso de la malignidad de su \xe1nimo\u2026 Los hombres no obran jam\xe1s el bien, a no ser por necesidad\u201d. (p. 32)La libertad, por tanto, es para Maquiavelo el supremo bien a cuya consecuci\xf3n debe ordenarse la comunidad pol\xedtica, y por esta consideraci\xf3n censura severamente a Julio C\xe9sar, por haber sido el exterminador de las libertades p\xfablicas y, en suma, de la Rep\xfablica romana. (p. 28)Ha de notarse, pues, que a los hombres hay que conquistarlos o eliminarlos, porque si se vengan de las ofensas leves, de las graves no pueden; as\xed que la ofensa que se haga al hombre debe ser tal, que le resulte imposible vengarse. (p. 3)\u2026 no sin haberle colgado previamente una inscripci\xf3n seg\xfan la cual Maquiavelo habr\xeda sido un hombre astuto y p\xe9rfido, coadjutor de los demonios e incomparable art\xedfice de maquinaciones diab\xf3licas: \u201cHomo vafer ac subdolus, diabolicarum cogitationum faber optimus, cacodaemonis auxiliator\u201d.

Still, the fact that a river is like this doesn\u2019t prevent us from preparing for trouble when levels are low, building banks and dykes, so that when the water rises the next time it can be contained in a single channel and the rush of the river in flood is not so uncontrolled and destructive.","Quien propicia que otro se vuelva poderoso obra su propia ruina.","Pero cuando las ciudades o provincias est\xe1n acostumbradas a vivir bajo un principe, y por la extinci\xf3n de \xe9ste y su linaje queda vacante el gobierno, como por un lado los habitantes estf\xe1n habituados a obedecer y por otro no tienen a qui\xe9n, y no se ponen de acuerdo para elegir a uno de entre ellos, ni saben vivir en libertad, y por \xfaltimo tampoco se deciden a tomar las armas contra el invasor, un principe puede f\xe1cilmente conquistarlas y retenerlas.","Cap\xedtulo XX.

It would be so easy to write the English cognate \u2018virtue\u2019, meaning the opposite of vice, but this is not what Machiavelli was talking about. He was not interested in the polarity \u2018good\u2019/\u2018evil\u2019, but in winning and losing, strength and weakness, success and failure. For Machiavelli \u2018virt\xf9\u2019 was any quality of character that enabled you to take political power or to hold on to it; in short, a winning trait. It could be courage in battle, or strength of personality, or political cunning, or it might even be the kind of ruthless cruelty that lets your subjects know you mean business. But one can hardly write \u2018cunning\u2019 or \u2018cruelty\u2019 for \u2018virt\xf9\u2019, even if one knows that in this context that is what the text means; because then you would lose the sense that although Machiavelli is not talking about the moral virtues he nevertheless wants to give a positive connotation to the particular qualities he is talking about: this cruelty is aimed at solving problems, retaining power, keeping a state strong, hence, in this context it is a \u2018virt\xf9\u2019. Ugly though it may sound, then, I have sometimes been obliged to translate \u2018virt\xf9\u2019 as \u2018positive qualities\u2019 or \u2018strength of character\u2019, except of course on those occasions - because there are some - when Machiavelli does mean \u2018virtues\u2019 in the moral sense: in which case he\u2019s usually talking about the importance of faking them even if you may not have them","Todos ven lo que pareces ser, mas pocos saben lo que eres.","Es esa perspectiva realista la que le obliga a concluir que un pr\xedncipe no debe actuar de forma invariable, siempre guiado por unos principios morales inamovibles e id\xe9nticos para cualquier situaci\xf3n, m\xe1s bien debe tener como \xfanico principio conseguir el beneficio de su Estado como un todo mediante la eliminaci\xf3n de la corrupci\xf3n del sistema, aunque para ello tenga que usar \xabhip\xf3critamente\xbb la religi\xf3n o conculcar sus preceptos cuando lo exija la situaci\xf3n.","In the end it will be necessary, if he wants to maintain a name for liberality, to burden the people extraordinarily, to be rigorous with taxes, and to do all those things that can be done to get money. This will begin to make him hated by his subjects, and little esteemed by anyone as he becomes poor; so having offended the many and rewarded the few with this liberality of his, he feels every least hardship and runs into risk at every slight danger. When he recognizes this, and wants to draw back from it, he immediately incurs the infamy of meanness.","Francisco Sforza tuvo siempre por adversario a los Bracceschi, y se vigilaron mutuamente; al fin, Francisco volvi\xf3 sus miras hacia la Lombard\xeda, y Braccio hacia la Iglesia y el reino de N\xe1poles.","Dificultad que estriba en que los hombres cambian con gusto de se\xf1or, creyendo mejorar; y esta creencia los impulsa a tomar las armas contra \xe9l; en lo cual se enga\xf1an, pues luego la experiencia les ense\xf1a que han empeorado.","quien promueve el que otro se convierta en poderoso labra su ruina, porque ese poder lo ha provocado o con la astucia o con la fuerza, y tanto la una como la otra resultan sospechosas al que se ha convertido en poderoso.","These men and others like them who rise to sovereignty through their own abilities face all kinds of difficulties when setting up their states but then hold on to them fairly easily. The initial difficulties depend in large part on the fact that in order to establish their government and guarantee its security they have to impose a new administrative system and new procedures. Here we have to bear in mind that nothing is harder to organize, more likely to fail, or more dangerous to see through, than the introduction of a new system of government. The person bringing in the changes will make enemies of everyone who was doing well under the old system, while the people who stand to gain from the new arrangements will not offer wholehearted support, partly because they are afraid of their opponents, who still have the laws on their side, and partly because people are naturally sceptical: no one really believes in change until they\u2019ve had solid experience of it.","Dios no quiere hacerlo todo, para no privarnos de nuestro libre albedr\xedo ni quitarnos una parte de la obra que en nuestro bien redundar\xe1.","Existem duas formas de se combater: uma, pelas leis; outra, pela for\xe7a.

If he\u2019s begging help, he\u2019s bound to fail and will get nowhere. But if he\u2019s got his own resources and can impose his plans, then it\u2019s unlikely he\u2019ll be running serious risks.

Como tampoco lo es el que procedan de dos sectores cristianos por lo dem\xe1s tan enfrentados entre s\xed. La raz\xf3n que los une es profunda: el rechazo a las concepciones maquiavelianas de la historia y del agente pol\xedtico; la negaci\xf3n, pues, de los dos pilares conceptuales que sustentan el pensamiento de Maquiavelo. Ciertamente se trata de dos nociones no-cristianas que permiten acciones anticristianas desde el punto de vista moral; sin embargo, no son conceptos ni inmorales ni antirreligiosos. T\xe9ngase en cuenta que aunque Maquiavelo manifiesta desprecio por el gobierno temporal del Papa con sus pretensiones de superioridad moral y sus pol\xedticas claramente corruptasdesde los propios c\xe1nones cristianos, sin embargo, ni desprecia el fen\xf3meno religioso ni su teor\xeda carece de noci\xf3n de bien.Aprecia la religi\xf3n en tanto que instrumento pol\xedtico para la cohesi\xf3n social, pero sin otorgarle ning\xfan valor hegem\xf3nico en lo normativo, dado que esto es -a su juicio - una prerrogativa de esa capacidad humana que es el saber pol\xedtico.

En esto consiste el bien. Por tanto, no son de extra\xf1ar las cr\xedticas vertidas desde un ideario como el cristiano que remite el bien al m\xe1s all\xe1 supramundano, pues la de Maquiavelo es una concepci\xf3n enteramente mundana.","Taki ksi\u0105\u017c\u0119, kt\xf3ry boi si\u0119 bardziej swego ludu ni\u017c obcych, powinien budowa\u0107 twierdz\u0119, natomiast powinien ich zaniecha\u0107 tej, kt\xf3ry bardziej obawia si\u0119 obcych ni\u017c ludu","Ne zaman bir sak\u0131ncadan ka\xe7maya \xe7al\u0131\u015fsak bir ba\u015fkas\u0131na d\xfc\u015feriz; ama sa\u011fduyu, sak\u0131ncalar\u0131n niteliklerini tan\u0131may\u0131 ve en az k\xf6t\xfcy\xfc iyi olarak se\xe7meyi bilmek demektir.","Dobre rady powinny wynika\u0107 z m\u0105dro\u015bci ksi\u0119cia, a nie m\u0105dro\u015b\u0107 ksi\u0119cia z dobrych rad","Niccol\xf2 di Bernardo dei Machiavelli (May 3, 1469 \u2013 June 21, 1527) was an Italian political philosopher, musician, poet, and romantic comedic playwright.

I think it\u2019s a question of whether cruelty is well or badly used. Cruelty well used (if we can ever speak well of something bad) is short-lived and decisive, no more than is necessary to secure your position and then stop; you don\u2019t go on being cruel but use the power it has given you to deliver maximum benefits to your subjects. Cruelty is badly used when you\u2019re not drastic enough at the beginning but grow increasingly cruel later on, rather than easing off. A leader who takes the first approach has a chance, like Agathocles, of improving his position with his subjects and with God too; go the other way and you have no chance at all. It\u2019s worth noting that when you take hold of a state, you must assess how much violence and cruelty will be necessary and get it over with at once, so as not to have to be cruel on a regular basis. When you\u2019ve stopped using violence your subjects will be reassured and you can then win them over with generosity. If you don\u2019t do all it takes at the beginning, because you were badly advised or didn\u2019t have the nerve, then you\u2019ll always have to be wielding the knife; and you\u2019ll never be able to count on your subjects, since with all the violence you\u2019re handing out they won\u2019t be able to count on you. So get the violence over with as soon as possible; that way there\u2019ll be less time for people to taste its bitterness and they\u2019ll be less hostile. Favours, on the other hand, should be given out slowly, one by one, so that they can be properly savoured. Most of all, though, a ruler should have the kind of relationship with his subjects where nothing that can happen, good or bad, will force him to change his approach, because if hard times demand it, your cruelty will come too late, while any concessions you make will be seen as wrung out of you and no one will be impressed. 9 Monarchy with public support Now let\u2019s turn to our second case, where a private citizen becomes king in his own country not by crime or unacceptable violence, but with the support of his fellow-citizens. We can call this a monarchy with public support and to become its king you don\u2019t have to be wholly brilliant or extraordinarily lucky, just shrewd in a lucky way. Obviously, to take control of this kind of state you need the support of either the common people or the wealthy families, the nobles. In","La cuesti\xf3n es complicada, porque - como ya se ha dicho - los acontecimientos pol\xedticos son concebidos por Maquiavelo como productos humanos \xednsitos en el estrato inmanente y natural del mundo e independientes del trascendente y sobrenatural, circunstancia que descarta como carente de sentido la posibilidad de que la legitimidad de los sistemas pol\xedticos la otorgue Dios. Fuera de esta soluci\xf3n tan querida por el pensamiento pol\xedtico cristiano, la cualidad de leg\xedtimo s\xf3lo puede provenir del colectivo social afectado, cosa que para el florentino sucede cuando la virt\xfa del pr\xedncipe produce los efectos deseados: la estabilidad y la paz social que se manifiesta en la aceptaci\xf3n del sistema de poder. Para ello son decisivas las buenas instituciones pol\xedticas y las buenas leyes. Ahora bien, muchas veces el pr\xedncipe ha de tomar decisiones impopulares que parecen vicio aunque sean virtud, de ah\xed que precise controlar su imagen p\xfablica y \xabser un gran simulador y disimulador\xbb capaz de evitar ser despreciado y odiado24.Aqu\xed se encuentra una de las principales aportaciones de Maquiavelo a la filosof\xeda pol\xedtica moderna, pues esta idea es el n\xfacleo de la teor\xeda de la legitimaci\xf3n indirecta. Desde la perspectiva inmanente aqu\xed adoptada, el problema no es si una dominaci\xf3n es en s\xed misma leg\xedtima o no, sino por qu\xe9 medios una dominaci\xf3n puede legitimarse y as\xed autoconservarse. La legitimaci\xf3n, pues, no es prima facie una cuesti\xf3n de racionalidad sustantiva, sino de racionalidad instrumental.","\u039f \u03ba\u03b1\u03b8\u03ad\u03bd\u03b1\u03c2 \u03b2\u03bb\u03ad\u03c0\u03b5\u03b9 \u03b1\u03c5\u03c4\u03cc \u03c0\u03bf\u03c5 \u03c6\u03b1\u03af\u03bd\u03b5\u03c3\u03b1\u03b9.\u039b\u03af\u03b3\u03bf\u03b9 \u03ba\u03b1\u03c4\u03b1\u03bb\u03b1\u03b2\u03b1\u03af\u03bd\u03bf\u03c5\u03bd \u03b1\u03c5\u03c4\u03cc \u03c0\u03bf\u03c5 \u03b5\u03af\u03c3\u03b1\u03b9.","For Fortune is a woman who to be kept under must be beaten and roughly handled; and we see that she suffers herself to be more readily mastered by those who so treat her than by those who are more timid in their approaches.

Chapter 26 An Exhortation to Liberate Italy from the Barbarians Turning over in my mind all the matters which have above been considered, and debating with myself whether in Italy at the present hour the times are such as might serve to","I say, therefore, that the arms with which a prince defends his state are either his own, or they are mercenaries, auxiliaries, or mixed. Mercenaries and auxiliaries are useless and dangerous; and if one holds his state based on these arms, he will stand neither firm nor safe; for they are disunited, ambitious and without discipline, unfaithful, valiant before friends, cowardly before enemies; they have neither the fear of God nor fidelity to men, and destruction is deferred only so long as the attack is; for in peace one is robbed by them, and in war by the enemy. The fact is, they have no other attraction or reason for keeping the field than a trifle of stipend, which is not sufficient to make them willing to die for you. They are ready enough to be your soldiers whilst you do not make war, but if war comes they take themselves off or run from the foe; which I should have little trouble to prove, for the ruin of Italy has been caused by nothing else than by resting all her hopes for many years on mercenaries, and although they formerly made some display and appeared valiant amongst themselves, yet when the foreigners came they showed what they were.","Ki\u015finin nas\u0131l ya\u015fad\u0131\u011f\u0131 ve nas\u0131l ya\u015famas\u0131 gerekti\u011fi aras\u0131nda \xf6yle b\xfcy\xfck bir u\xe7urum vard\u0131r ki, yap\u0131lmas\u0131 gereken u\u011fruna yap\u0131lan\u0131 terk eden ki\u015fi, \xe7ok ge\xe7meden korunmas\u0131n\u0131 de\u011fil, y\u0131k\u0131m\u0131n\u0131 \xf6\u011frenmi\u015f olur.","As\xed pasa en las cosas del Estado: los males que nacen en \xe9l, cuando se los descubre a tiempo, lo que s\xf3lo es dado al hombre sagaz, se los cura pronto; pero ya no tienen remedio cuando, por no haberlos advertido, se los deja crecer hasta el punto de que todo el mundo los ve.","Los medios que ofrece son de caracter\xedsticas bien distintas: la religi\xf3n, rodearse de personas de talento, usar sicarios para las tareas impopulares, llevar a cabo empresasgrandes y vistosas, etc. En cualquier caso es imprescindible la seducci\xf3n por la apariencia, aunque implique manipulaci\xf3n de la realidad y de la opini\xf3n de los s\xfabditos.
