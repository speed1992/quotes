We should never allow our fears or the expectations of others to set the frontiers of our destiny. Your destiny can\'t be changed but, it can be challenged. Every man is born as many men and dies as a single one.","A boundary is not that at which something stops, but that from which something begins.","The most thought-provoking thing in our thought-provoking time is that we are still not thinking.","A person is neither a thing nor a process but an opening through which the Absolute can manifest.","Dwelling is not primarily inhabiting but taking care of and creating that space within which something comes into its own and flourishes.","Nothing is everything that doesn\'t happen at this very moment.","Everyone is the other and no one is himself.","Teaching is more difficult than learning because what teaching calls for is this: to let learn. The real teacher, in fact, lets nothing else be learned than learning. His conduct, therefore, often produces the impression that we properly learn nothing from him, if by \\"learning\\" we now suddenly understand merely the procurement of useful information.","Man acts as though he were the shaper and master of language, while in fact language remains the master of man.","Freedom is only to be found where there is burden to be shouldered. In creative achievements this burden always represents an imperative and a need that weighs heavily upon man\u2019s mood, so that he comes to be in a mood of melancholy. All creative action resides in a mood of melancholy, whether we are clearly aware of the fact or not, whether we speak at length about it or not. All creative action resides in a mood of melancholy, but this is not to say that everyone in a melancholy mood is creative.","Is the earth in our head? Or do we stand on the earth?","Everywhere we remain unfree and chained to technology, whether we passionately affirm or deny it. But we are delivered over to it in the worst possible way when we regard it as something neutral; for this conception of it, to which today we particularly like to do homage, makes us utterly blind to the essence of technology.","We make a space inside ourselves, so that being can speak.","Making itself intelligible is suicide for philosophy.","Thinking begins only when we have come to know that reason, glorified for centuries, is the stiff-necked adversary of thought.","Questioning is the piety of thought.","Language is the house of Being. In its home man dwells. Those who think and those who create with words are the guardians of this home.","Every man is born as many men and dies as a single one.","Transcendence constitutes selfhood.","The small are always dependent on the great; they are \\"small\\" precisely because they think they are independent. The great thinker is one who can hear what is greatest in the work of other \\"greats\\" and who can transform it in an original manner.","The possible ranks higher than the actual.","Being-alone is a deficient mode of being-with; its possibility is a proof for the latter.","Why are there beings at all, instead of Nothing?","The human being is not the lord of beings, but the shepherd of Being.","Tell me how you read and I\'ll tell you who you are.","Only where leader and led together bind each other in one destiny ... does true order grow.","We do not \\"have\\" a body; rather, we \\"are\\" bodily.","We do not say: Being is, time is, but rather: there is Being and there is time.","truth is that which makes a people certain, clear, and strong.","The will to mastery becomes all the more urgent the more technology threatens to slip from human control","Philosophy will not be able to effect an immediate transformation of the present condition of the world. This is not only true of philosophy, but of all merely human thought and endeavor.","Longing is the agony of the nearness of the distant.","Profound boredom, drifting here and there in the abysses of our existence like a muffling fog, removes all things and men and oneself along with it into a remarkable indifference. This boredom reveals being as a whole.","What was Aristotle\u2019s life?\u2019 Well, the answer lay in a single sentence: \u2018He was born, he thought, he died.\u2019 And all the rest is pure anecdote.","To think is to confine yourself to a single thought that one day stands still like a star in the world\'s sky.","Spiritual superiority [consists in] deep dedication ... in the form of the most rigorous training, as commitment, resistance, solitude, and love.","Being is only Being for Dasein.","Why are there beings at all instead of nothing? That is the question. Presumably it is not arbitrary question, \\"Why are there beings at all instead of nothing\\"- this is obviously the first of all questions. Of course it is not the first question in the chronological sense [...] And yet, we are each touched once, maybe even every now and then, by the concealed power of this question, without properly grasping what is happening to us. In great despair, for example, when all weight tends to dwindle away from things and the sense of things grows dark, the question looms.","Agriculture is now a motorized food industry, the same thing in its essence as the production of corpses in the gas chambers and the extermination camps, the same thing as blockades and the reduction of countries to famine, the same thing as the manufacture of hydrogen bombs.","Being and time determine each other reciprocally, but in such a manner that neither can the former - Being - be addressed as something temporal nor can the latter - time - be addressed as a being.","To be a poet in a destitute time means: to attend, singing, to the trace of the fugitive gods. This is why the poet in the time of the world\'s night utters the holy.","Celebration... is self restraint, is attentiveness, is questioning, is meditating, is awaiting, is the step over into the more wakeful glimpse of the wonder - the wonder that a world is worlding around us at all, that there are beings rather than nothing, that things are and we ourselves are in their midst, that we ourselves are and yet barely know who we are, and barely know that we do not know all this.","I see the situation of man in the world of planetary technicity not as an inexitricable and inescapable destiny, but I see the task of thought precisely in this, that within its own limits it helps man as such achieve a satisfactory relationship to the essence of technicity. National Socialism did indeed go in this direction. Those people, however, were far too poorly equipped for thought to arrive at a really explicit relationship to what is happening today and has been underway for the past 300 years.","In everything well known something worthy of thought still lurks.","From our human experience and history, at least as far as I am informed, I know that everything essential and great has only emerged when human beings had a home and were rooted in a tradition. Today\'s literature is, for instance, largely destructive.","The relationship between man and space is none other than dwelling, strictly thought and spoken.","In order to remain silent Da-sein must have something to say.","Only if we are capable of dwelling, only then can we build","We should live totally in the face of the night and of the Evil.","he who thinks great thoughts often makes great errors","In no way can it be uttered, as can other things, which one can learn. Rather, from out of a full, co-existential dwelling with the thing itself - as when a spark, leaping from the fire, flares into light - so it happens, suddenly, in the soul, there to grow, alone with itself.","Only a god can save us.","Body\', \'soul\', and \'spirit\' may designate phenomenal domains which can be detached as themes for definite investigations; within certain limits their ontological indefiniteness may not be important. When, however, we come to the question of man\'s Being, this is not something we can simply compute by adding together those kinds of Being which body, soul, and spirit respectively possess--kinds of being whose nature has not as yet been determined. And even if we should attempt such an ontological procedure, some idea of the Being of the whole must be presupposed.","True time is four-dimensional.","We name time when we say: every thing has its time. This means: everything which actually is, every being comes and goes at the right time and remains for a time during the time allotted to it. Every thing has its time.","Temporality temporalizes as a future which makes present in the process of having been.","The question concerning technology is the question concerning the constellation in which revealing and concealing, in which the coming to presence of truth, comes to pass","To dwell is to garden.","Nietzsche ... does not shy from conscious exaggeration and one-sided formulations of his thought, believing that in this way he can most clearly set in relief what in his vision and in his inquiry is different from the run-of-the-mill.","In Nietzsche\'s view nihilism is not a Weltanschauung that occurs at some time and place or another; it is rather the basic character of what happens in Occidental history.","Technology is therefore no mere means. Technology is a way of revealing. If we give heed to this, then another whole realm for the essence of technology will open itself up to us. It is the realm of revealing, i.e., of truth","I know that everything essential and great originated from the fact that the human being had a homeland and was rooted in tradition.","We ourselves are the entities to be analyzed.","Understanding of being is itself a determination of being of Da-sein.","Pessimism negates the existing world. Yet its negating is ambiguous. It can simply will decay and nothingness, but it can also renounce what exists and thus open a path for a new formation of the world.","Being is an issue for one.","And so man, as existing transcendence abounding in and surpassing toward possibilities, is a creature of distance. Only through the primordial distances he establishes toward all being in his transcendence does a true nearness to things flourish in him.","The world worlds, and is more fully in being than the tangible and perceptible realm in which we believe ourselves to be at home...By the opening up of a world, all things gain their lingering and hastening, their remoteness and nearness, their scope and limits. In a world\'s worlding is gathered that spaciousness out of which the protective grace of the gods is granted and withheld. Even this doom of the god remaining absent is a way in which the world worlds...All coming to presence...keeps itself concealed to the last.","But what is great can only begin great.","We would like only, for once, to get to where we are already.","The poets are in the vanguard of a changed conception of Being.","The German language speaks Being, while all the others merely speak of Being.","Questions are not happenstance thoughts nor are questions common problems of today which one picks up from hearsay and booklearning and decks out with a gesture of profundity questions grow out of confrontation with the subject matter and the subject matter is there only where eyes are, it is in this manner that questions will be posed and all the more considering that questions that have today fallen out of fashion in the great industry of problems. One stands up for nothing more than the normal running of the industry. Philosophy interprets its corruption as the resurrection of metaphysics.","The domination of the public way in which things have been interpreted has already decided upon even the possibilities of being attuned, that is, about the basic way in which Da-sein lets itself be affected by the world. The they prescribes that attunement, it determines what and how one \\"sees.","When modern physics exerts itself to establish the world\'s formula, what occurs thereby is this: the being of entities has resolved itself into the method of the totally calculable.","The threat to man does not come in the first instance from the potentially lethal machines and apparatus of technology. The actual threat has already affected man in his essence. The rule of Enframing threatens man with the possibility that it could be denied to him to enter into a more original revealing and hence to experience the call of a more primal truth","In many places, above all in the Anglo-Saxon countries, logistics is today considered the only possible form of strict philosophy, because its result and procedures yield an assured profit for the construction of the technological universe. In America and elsewhere, logistics as the only proper philosophy of the future is thus beginning today to seize power over the intellectual world.","Since time itself is not movement, it must somehow have to do with movement.Time is initially encountered in those entities which are changeable, change is in time. How is time exhibited in this way of encountering it, namely, as that within which things change? Does it here give itself as itself in what it is? Can an axplacation of time starts here guarantee that time will thereby provide as it were the fundamental phenomena that determine it in its own being?","Time is not a thing, thus nothing which is, and yet it remains constant in its passing away without being something temporal like the beings in time.","I take great pleasure, every day, in seeing my work deeply rooted in our native soil.","Whatever can be noted historically can be found within history.","Thus \\"phenomenology\\" means \u03b1\u03c0\u03bf\u03c6\u03b1\u03b9\u03bd\u03b5\u03c3\u03b8\u03b1\u03b9 \u03c4\u03b1 \u03c6\u03b1\u03b9\u03bd\u03bf\u03bc\u03b5\u03bd\u03b1 -- to let that which shows itself be seen from itself in the very way in which it shows itself from itself.","The word \\"art\\" does not designate the concept of a mere eventuality; it is a concept of rank.","Language is the house of the truth of Being.","Everyone is the other, and no one is himself. The they, which supplies the answer to the who of everyday Da-sein, is the nobody to whom every Da-sein has always already surrendered itself, in its being-among-one-another.","Nevertheless, the ultimate business of philosophy is to preserve the force of the most elemental words in which Dasein expresses itself, and to keep the common understanding from levelling them off to that unintelligibility which functions in turn as a source of pseudo-problems.","We still by no means think decisively enough about the essence of action.","The world, in resting upon the earth, strives to surmount it. As self-opening it cannot endure anything closed. The earth, however, as sheltering and concealing, tends always to draw the world into itself and keep it there","What seems natural to us is probably just something familiar in a long tradition that has forgotten the unfamiliar source from which it arose. And yet this unfamiliar source once struck man as strange and caused him to think and to wonder.","The Fuhrer alone is the present and future German reality and its law. Learn to know ever more deeply: from now on every single thing demands decision, and every action responsibility.","What is peddled about nowadays as philosophy, especially that of N.S. [National Socialism], but has nothing to do with the inner truth and greatness of that movement [namely the encounter between global technology and modern humanity] is nothing but fishing in that troubled sea of values and totalities.","The relation of feeling toward art and its bringing-forth can be one of production or one of reception and enjoyment.","A man\'s first bond is that which ties him into the national community.","There is no such thing as an empty word, only one that is worn out yet remains full.","The mathematical is that evident aspect of things within which we are always already moving and according to which we experience them as things at all, and as such things. The mathematical is this fundamental position we take toward things by which we take up things as already given to us, and as they must and should be given. Therefore, the mathematical is the fundamental presupposition of the knowledge of things.","A giving which gives only its gift, but in the giving holds itself back and withdraws, such a giving we call sending.","The human body is essentially something other than an animal organism.","If in Nietzsche\'s thinking the prior tradition of Western thought is gathered and completed in a decisive respect, then the confrontation with Nietzsche becomes one with all Western thought hitherto.","So long as we represent technology as an instrument, we remain held fast in the will to master it.","In the work of art the truth of an entity has set itself to work. \u2018To set\u2019 means here: to bring to a stand. Some particular entity, a pair of peasant shoes, comes in the work to stand in the light of its being. The being of the being comes into the steadiness of its shining. The nature of art would then be this: the truth of being setting itself to work.","Dasein is a being that does not simply occur among other beings. Rather it is ontically distinguished by the fact that in its being this being is concerned about its very being. Thus it is constitutive of the being of Dasein to have, in its very being, a relation of being to this being.","Time-space as commonly understood, in the sense of the distance measured between two time-points, is the result of time calculation.","The essence of technology is by no means anything technological.","But every historical statement and legitimization itself moves within a certain relation to history.","The senses do not enable us to cognize any entity in its Being; they merely serve to announce the ways in which \'external\' Things within-the-world are useful or harmful for human creatures encumbered with bodies....they tell us nothing about entities in their Being.","As the ego cogito, subjectivity is the consciousness that represents something, relates this representation back to itself, and so gathers with itself.","The average, vague understanding of being can be permeated by traditional theories and opinions about being in such a way that these theories, as the sources of the prevailing understanding, remain hidden.","The song still remains which names the land over which it sings.","Form displays the relation [to beings] itself as the state of original comportment toward beings, the festive state in which the being itself in its essence is celebrated and thus for the first time placed in the open.","To think Being itself explicitly requires disregarding Being to the extent that it is only grounded and interpreted in terms of beings and for beings as their ground, as in all metaphysics.","This characteristic of Dasein\'s being this \\"that it is\\" is veiled in its \\"whence\\" and \\"whither.","The critique of the highest values hitherto does not simply refute them or declare them invalid. It is rather a matter of displaying their origins as impositions which must affirm precisely what ought to be negated by the values established.","Why is love beyond all measure of other human possibilities so rich and such a sweet burden for the one who has been struck by it? Because we change ourselves into that which we love, and yet remain ourselves. Then we would like to thank the beloved, but find nothing that would do it adequately. We can only be thankful to ourselves. Love transforms gratitude into faithfulness to ourselves and into an unconditional faith in the Other. Thus love steadily expands its most intimate secret. Closeness here is existence in the greatest distance from the other- the distance that allows nothing to dissolve - but rather presents the \u201cthou in the transparent, but \u201cincomprehensible\u201d revelation of the \u201cjust there\u201d. That the presence of the other breaks into our own life - this is what no feeling can fully encompass. Human fate gives itself to human fate, and it is the task of pure love to keep this self-surrender as vital as on the first day.\u201d","Thinking only begins at the point where we have come to know that Reason, glorified for centuries, is the most obstinate adversary of thinking.","When the farthest corner of the globe has been conquered technologically and can be exploited economically; when any incident you like, in any place you like, at any time you like, becomes accessible as fast as you like; when you can simultaneously \\"experience\\" an assassination attempt against a king in France and a symphony concert in Tokyo; when time is nothing but speed, instantaneity, and simultaneity, and time as history has vanished from all Being of all peoples; when a boxer counts as the great man of a people; when the tallies of millions at mass meetings are a triumph; then, yes then, there still looms like a specter over all this uproar the question: what for? \u2014 where to? \u2014 and what then?","only he who already understands can listen","Philosophy, then, is not a doctrine, not some simplistic scheme for orienting oneself in the world, certainly not an instrument or achievement of human Dasein. Rather, it is this Dasein itself insofar as it comes to be, in freedom, from out of its own ground. Whoever, by stint of research, arrives at this self-understanding of philosophy is granted the basic experience of all philosophizing, namely that the more fully and originally research comes into its own, the more surely is it \\"nothing but\\" the transformation of the same few simple questions. But those who wish to transform must bear within themselves the power of a fidelity that knows how to preserve. And one cannot feel this power growing within unless one is up in wonder. And no one can be caught up in wonder without travelling to the outermost limits of the possible. But no one will ever become the friend of the possible without remaining open to dialogue with the powers that operate in the whole of human existence. But that is the comportment of the philosopher: to listen attentively to what is already sung forth, which can still be perceived in each essential happening of world. And in such comportment the philosopher enters the core of what is truly at stake in the task he has been given to do. Plato knew of that and spoke of it in his Seventh Letter:\'In no way can it be uttered, as can other things, which one can learn. Rather, from out of a full, co-existential dwelling with the thing itself - as when a spark, leaping from the fire, flares into light - so it happens, suddenly, in the soul, there to grow, alone with itself.","Man dies constantly until the moment of his demise.","We are too late for the gods and too early for Being.","The nothing nothings.","Das Nichts nichtet","When tradition thus becomes master, it does so in such a way that what it transmits is made so inaccessible, proximally and for the most part, that it rather becomes concealed. Tradition takes what has come down to us and delivers it over to self-evidence; it blocks our access to those primordial \\"sources\\" from which the categories and concepts handed down to us have been in part quite genuinely drawn. Indeed it makes us forget that they have had such an origin, and makes us suppose that the necessity of going back to these sources is something which we need not even understand.","Anxiety is there. It is only sleeping. Its breath quivers perpetually through Dasein, only slightly in those who are jittery, imperceptibly in the \'Oh, yes\' and the \'Oh, no\' of men of affairs; but most readily in the reserved, and most assuredly in those who are basically daring. But those daring ones sustained by that on which they expend themselves\u2014in order thus to preserve the ultimate grandeur of existence.","He who never says anything cannot keep silent at any given moment.","Mere anxiety is the source of everything","...\\"Nature\\" is not to be understood as that which is just present-at-hand, nor as the power of Nature. The wood is a forest of timber, the mountain a quarry of rock; the river is water-power, the wind is wind \'in the sails\'. As the \'environment\' is discovered, the \'Nature\' thus discovered is encountered too. If its kind of Being as ready-to-hand is disregarded, this \'Nature\' itself can be discovered and defined simply in its pure presence-at-hand. But when this happens, the Nature which \'stirs and strives\', which assails us and enthralls us as landscape, remains hidden. The botanist\'s plants are not the flowers of the hedgerow; the \'source\' which the geographer establishes for a river is not the \'springhead in the dale\'.","Even in expecting, one leaps away from the possible and gets a footing in the real. It is for its reality that what is expected is expected. By the very nature of expecting, the possible is drawn into the real, arising from it and returning to it.","...Dasein itself--and this means also its Being-in-the-world--gets its ontological understanding of itself in the first instance from those entities which it itself is not but which it encounters \'within\' its world, and from the Being which they possess.","But \u201cnowhere does not mean nothing; rather, region in general lies therein, and disclosedness of the world in general for essentially spatial being-in. Therefore, what is threatening cannot come closer from a definite direction within nearness, it is already \u201cthere\u201d - and yet nowhere. It is so near that it is oppressive and takes one\u2019s breath - and yet it is nowhere.\u201d","In the midst of beings as a whole an open place occurs. There is a clearing, a lighting... Only this clearing grants and guarantees to us humans a passage to those beings that we ourselves are not, and access to the being that we ourselves are.","Die Sprache ist das Haus des Seins.","Every questioning is a seeking. Every seeking takes its direction beforehand from what is sought. Questioning is a knowing search for beings in their thatness and whatness.","Language is the house of Being.","Everywhere we remain unfree and chained to technology, whether we passionately affirm or deny it. But we are delivered over to it in the worst possible way when we regard it as something neutral; for this conception of it, to which today we particularly pay homage, makes us utterly blind to the essence of technology.","...then he comes to the brink of a precipitous fall; that is, he comes to the point where he himself will have to be taken as standing-reserve. Meanwhile man, precisely as the one so threatened, exalts himself to the posture of lord of the earth. In this way the impression comes to prevail that everything man encounters exists only insofar as it is his construct. This illusion gives rise in turn to one final delusion: It seems as though man everywhere and always encounters only himself... In truth, however, precisely nowhere does man today any longer encounter himself, i.e. his essence. Man stands so decisively in attendance on the challenging-forth of Enframing that he does not apprehend Enframing as a claim, that he fails to see himself as the one spoken to, and hence also fails in every way to hear in what respect he ek-sists, from out of his essence, in the realm of an exhortation or address, and thus can never encounter only himself.","If knowing is to be possible as a way of determining the nature of the present-at-hand by observing it, then there must first be a deficiency in our having-to-do with the world concernfully. When concern holds back from any kind of producing, manipulating and the like, it puts itself into what is now the sole remaining mode of Being-in, the mode of just tarrying-alongside.

[s. 224]","Ontically, of course, Dasein is not only close to us\u2015even that which is closest: we *are* it, each of us, we ourselves. In spite of this, or rather for just this reason, it is ontologically that which is farthest. To be sure, its ownmost Being is such that it has an understanding of that Being, and already maintains itself in each case as if its Being has been interpreted in some manner. But we are certainly not saying that when Dasein\'s own Being is thus interpreted pre-ontologically in the way which lies closest, this interpretation can be taken over as an appropriate clue, as if this way of understanding Being is what must emerge when one\'s ownmost state of Being is considered as an ontological theme. The kind of Being which belongs to Dasein is rather such that, in understanding its own Being, it has a tendency to do so in terms of that entity towards which it comports itself proximally and in a way which is essentially constant\u2015in terms of the \'world\'. In Dasein itself, and therefore in its own understanding of Being, the way the world is understood is, as we shall show, reflected back ontologically upon the way in which Dasein itself gets interpreted.Thus because Dasein is ontico-ontologically prior, its own specific state of Being (if we understand this in the sense of Dasein\'s \'categorial structure\') remains concealed from it. Dasein is ontically \'closest\' to itself and ontologically farthest; but pre-ontologically it is surely not a stranger.\\"\u2015from_Being and Time_.

But inasmuch as man, because of his nature as the thinking animal and by virtue of forming ideas, is related to beings in their Being, is thereby related to Being, and is thus determined by Being\u2014therefore man\'s being, in keeping with this relatedness of Being (which now means, of the will) to human nature, must emphatically appear as a willing.","Only in thoughtful dialogue with what it says can this fragment of thinking be translated.

That is the big problem of the Western world.","Dasein exists as an entity for which, in its Being, that Being is itself an issue. Essentially ahead of itself, it has projected itself upon its potentiality-for-Being before going on to any mere consideration of itself. In its projection it reveals itself as something which has been thrown. It has been thrownly abandoned to the \u2018world\u2019, and falls into it concernfully.(1) As care\u2014that is, as existing in the unity of the projection which has been fallingly thrown\u2014this entity has been disclosed as a \u201cthere. As being with Others, it maintains itself in an average way of interpreting\u2014a way which has been Articulated in discourse and expressed in language. Being-in-the-world has always expressed itself, and as Being alongside entities encountered within-the-world, it constantly expresses itself in addressing itself to the very object of its concern and discussing it. The concern of circumspective common sense is grounded in temporality\u2014indeed in the mode of a making-present which retains and awaits. Such concern, as concernfully reckoning up, planning, preventing, or taking precautions, always says (whether audibly or not) that something is to happen \u2018then\u2019, that something else is to be attended to \u2018beforehand\u2019, that what has failed or eluded us \u2018on that former occasion\u2019 is something that we must \u2018now\u2019 make up for.(2)\u201d","Expelled from the truth of Being, man everywhere circles around himself as the animal rationale.","The last god has his own most unique uniqueness and stands outside of the calculative determination expressed in the labels \u201cmono-theism, \u201cpan-theism,\u201d and \u201ca-theism.\u201d There has been \u201cmonotheism,\u201d and every other sort of \u201ctheism,\u201d only since the emergence of Judeo-Christian \u201capologetics,\u201d whose thinking presupposes \u201cmetaphysics.\u201d With the death of this God, all theisms wither away. The multiplicity of gods is not subject to enumeration but, instead, to the inner richness of the grounds and abysses in the site of the moment for the lighting up and concealment of the intimation of the last god.\u201d","One expects philosophy to promote, and even to accelerate, the practical and technical business of culture by alleviating it, making it easier. {9}","It is not necessary that in resoluteness one should explicitly know the origin of the possibilities upon which that resoluteness projects itself. It is rather in Dasein\'s temporality, and there only, that there lies any possibility that the existentiell potentiality-for-Being upon which it projects itself can be gleaned explicitly from the way in which Dasein has been traditionally understood. The resoluteness which comes back to itself and hands itself down, then becomes the repetition of a possibility of existence that has come down to us. Repeating is handing down explicitly\u2014that is to say, going back into the possibilities of the Dasein that has-been-there. The authentic repetition of a possibility of existence that has been\u2014the possibility that Dasein may choose its hero\u2014is grounded existentially in anticipatory resoluteness; for it is in resoluteness that one first chooses the choice which makes one free for the struggle of loyally following in the footsteps of that which can be repeated. But when one has, by repetition, handed down to oneself a possibility that has been, the Dasein that has-been-there is not disclosed in order to be actualized over again. The repeating of that which is possible does not bring again [Wiederbringen] something that is \'past\', nor does it bind the \'Present\' back to that which has already been \'outstripped\'. Arising, as it does, from a resolute projection of oneself, repetition does not let itself be persuaded of something by what is \'past\', just in order that this, as something which was formerly actual, may recur. Rather, the repetition makes a reciprocative rejoinder to the possibility of that existence which has-been-there. But when such a rejoinder is made to this possibility in a resolution, it is made in a moment of vision; and as such it is at the same time a disavowal of that which in the \\"today\\", is working itself out as the \'past\'. Repetition does not abandon itself to that which is past, nor does it aim at progress. In the moment of vision authentic existence is indifferent to both these alternatives (437-8).\u201d","Speaking a lot about something does not in the least guarantee that understanding is thus furthered. On the contrary, talking at great length about something covers things over and brings what is understood into an illusory clarity, that is, the unintelligibility of the trivial.

The sheltering is itself carried out in and as Da-sein. That happens, and gains and loses history, in the steadfast care-taking which in advance pertains to the event though scarcely has knowledge of the event. This care-taking, conceived not on the basis of everydayness but from the selfhood of Dasein, abides in various mutually requisite modes: the fabrication of implements, the instituting of machinations (technology), the creation of works, the acts that form states, and thoughtful sacrifice. In all of these, in each one differently, a pre-forming and co-forming of cognition and of essential knowledge as the grounding of truth. \u201cScience only a remote scion of a determinate permeation of implement-production, etc.; nothing autonomous and never to be brought into connection with the essential knowledge of the inventive thinking of being (philosophy).\u201d","But what about \\"time\\"? After all it is not a bundle in which past, future and present are wrapped up together. Time is not a cage in which the \\"no longer now,\\" the \\"not yet now,\\" and the \\"now\\" are cooped up together. How do matters stand with \\"time\\"? They stand thus: time goes. And it goes in that it passes away. The passing of time is, of course, a coming, but a coming which goes, in passing away. What comes in time never comes to stay, but to go. What comes in time always bears beforehand the mark of going past and passing away. This is why everything temporal is regarded simply as what is transitory.","Der Mensch versucht vergeblich, durch sein Planen den Erdball in eine Ordnung zu bringen, wenn er nicht dem Zuspruch des Feldweges eingeordnet ist.","Do we know ourselves\u2014our \u201cself?

This is not our own invention; it is a way of putting the theme which comes to life at the beginning of philosophy in antiquity, and it assumes its most grandiose form in Hegel\'s logic. At present we are merely asserting that Being is the proper and sole theme of philosophy. Negatively, this means that philosophy is not a science of beings but of Being or, as the Greek expression goes, ontology. We take this expression in the widest possible sense and not in the narrower one it has, say, in Scholasticism or in modern philosophy in Descartes and Leibniz.A discussion of the basic problems of phenomenology then is tantamount to providing fundamental substantiation for this assertion that philosophy is the science of Being and establishing how it is such. The discussion should show the possibility and necessity of the absolute science of Being and demonstrate its character in the very process of the inquiry. Philosophy is the theoretical conceptual interpretation of Being, of Being\'s structure and its possibilities. Philosophy is ontological.\\" \u2015from_The Basic Problems of Phenomenology_","Man is the shepherd of Being. Man loses nothing in this \\"less\\"; rather, he gains in that he attains the truth of Being. He gains the essential poverty of the shepherd, whose dignity consists in being called by Being itself into the preservation of Being\'s truth. The call comes as the throw from which the thrownness of Da-sein derives. In his essential unfolding within the history of Being, man is the being whose Being as ek-sistence consists in his dwelling in the nearness of Being. Man is the neighbor of Being.","Philosophy, then, is that thinkins with which one can start nothing and about which housemaids necessarily laugh. Such a definition of philosophy is not a mere joke but is something to think over. We shall fo well to remember occasionally that by our strolling we can fall into a well whereby we may not reach ground for quite some time.","Speaking is known as the articulated vocalization of thought by means of the organs of speech. But speaking is at the same time also listening. It is the custom to put speaking and listening in opposition: one man speaks, the other listens. But listening accompanies and surrounds not only speaking such as takes place in conversation. The simultaneousness of speaking and listening has a larger meaning. Speaking is of itself a listening. Speaking is listening to the language which we speak. Thus, it is a listening not while but before we are speaking. This listening to language also comes before all other kinds of listening that we know, in a most inconspicuous manner. We do not merely speak the language\u2014we speak by way of it. We can do so solely because we always have already listened to the language. What do we hear there? We hear language speaking.","The moving force in Showing of Saying is Owning. It is what brings all present and absent beings each into their own, from where they show themselves in what they are, and where they abide according to their kind. This owning which brings them there, and which moves Saying as Showing in its showing we call Appropriation. It yields the opening of the clearing in which present beings can persist and from which absent beings can depart while keeping their persistence in the withdrawal.","Language speaks and not the human.","Only from the truth of being can the essence of the holy be thought...

Yet the successes and failures of everything public will swarm and follow closely one upon the other, whereby, typical of that which is public, nothing will be surmised of what is actually happening. It is only between this reigning of the massive and the genuinely sacrificed that the few and their allies will seek and find one another in order to surmise that something concealed\u2014namely, that passing by\u2014is happening to them in the midst of all the tearing away of every \u201chappening into what is of high speed yet at the same time completely graspable and thoroughly consumable. The perverting and confusing of the claims and of their domains will no longer be possible, because the truth of beyng itself, in the sharpest falling apart of the fissure of beyng, has brought the essential possibilities to decision. This historical moment is not an \u201cideal situation,\u201d because the latter will always be incompatible with the essence of history. Instead, this moment is the eventuation of that turning in which the truth of beyng comes to the beyng of truth, since the god needs beyng and since the human being, as Da-sein, must have grounded the belonging to beyng. Beyng as the innermost \u201cbetween\u201d is then akin to nothingness for this moment; the god overpowers the human being, and the latter surpasses the god\u2014immediately, so to speak. Yet both are only in the event, and the truth of beyng itself is as this event. Nevertheless, a long, often relapsing, and very concealed history will transpire up to this incalculable moment which of course could never be as superficial as a \u201cgoal.\u201d The creative ones, in the restraint of care, must already prepare themselves hourly for stewardship in the time-space of that passing by. Thoughtful meditation on this that is unique (namely, the truth of beyng) can only be a path on which what is unable to be thought in advance is nevertheless thought, i.e., a path on which there begins the transformation of the relation of the human being to the truth of beyng.\u201d","The thoughtless habit of using the words \u201cexistence and \u201cexist\u201d as designations for being is one more indication of our estrangement both from being and from a radical, forceful, and definite exegesis of being.\u201d","The things for which we owe thanks are not things we have from ourselves.

The concealment of transcendence is not a total unawareness but, what is much more fateful, a misunderstanding, a faulty interpretation. Faulty interpretations, misunderstandings, put much more stubborn obstacles in the way of authentic cognition than a total ignorance. However, these faulty interpretations of transcendence, of the basic relationship of Dasein to beings and to itself, are no mere defects of thought or acumen. They have their reason and their necessity in the Dasein\'s own historical existence. In the end, these faulty interpretations must be made, so that the Dasein may reach the path to the true phenomena by correcting them.","Es kann sein, da\xdf wir eines Tages aus unserer Allt\xe4glichkeit herausr\xfccken und in die Macht der Dichtung einr\xfccken m\xfcssen, da\xdf wir nie mehr so in die Allt\xe4glichkeit zur\xfcckkehren, wie wir sie verlassen haben.","Every valuing, even when it values positively, is a subjectivizing.

But everything lives on this forgotten forgottenness. In the prologue of the machination of the framework (creatio), the mere masks are converted into the persons. Personality is created. What is alive can be represented only as person. Blind screaming for the personal Thou counts as the ultimate in thoughtfulness. The paths of thinking have been abandoned long ago\u2014admittedly in such a way that this wild flight in the face of thinking (i.e., in the face of the withstanding of the belongingness to the essentially occurring essence, to the provenance of \u1f08\u03bb\u1f75\u03b8\u03b5\u03b9\u03b1) appears to be the victory of thinking and therefore at the lowest stage of the decline is not afraid to present thinking as a believing.","A building, a Greek temple, portrays nothing. It simply stands there in the middle of the rock-cleft valley. The building encloses the figure of the god, and in this concealment lets it stand out into the holy precinct through the open portico. By means of the temple, the god is present in the temple. This presence of the god is in itself the extension and delimitation of the precinct as a holy precinct. The temple and its precinct, however, do not fade away into the indefinite. It is the temple-work that first fits together and at the same time gathers around itself the unity of those paths and relations in which birth and death, disaster and blessing, victory and disgrace, endurance and decline acquire the shape of destiny for human being.","How should the new day arrive, if the night is withheld from it and everything is suppressed into the twilight of decisionlessness?","The temple, in its standing there, first gives to things their look and to men their outlook on themselves. This view remains open as long as the work is a work, as long as the god has not fled from it. It is the same with the sculpture of the god, a votive offering of the victor in the athletic games. It is not a portrait whose purpose is to make it easier to realize how the god looks; rather, it is a work that lets the god himself be present and thus is the god himself. The same holds for the linguistic work. In the tragedy nothing is staged or displayed theatrically, but the battle of the new gods against the old is being fought. The linguistic work, originating in the speech of the people, does not refer to this battle; it transforms the people\'s saying so that now every living word fights the battle and puts up for decision what is holy and what unholy, what lofty and what flighty, what master and what slave.","Because they are assertions about Being in the light of time properly understood, all ontological propositions are Temporal propositions. It is only because ontological propositions are Temporal propositions that they can and must be *a priori propositions*. It is only because ontology is a Temporal science that something like the *a priori* appears in it. *A priori* means \\"from the earlier\\" or \\"the earlier.\\" \\"*Earlier*\\" is patently a *time-determination*. If we have been observant, it must have occurred to us that in our explications we employed no word more frequently than the expression \\"already.\\" It \\"already antecedently\\" lies at the ground: \\"it must always already be understood beforehand\\": where beings are encountered, Being has \\"already beforehand\\" been projected. In using all of these temporal, really Temporal, terms we have in mind something that the tradition since Plato calls the *a priori*, even if it may not use the very term itself. In the preface to his *Metaphysische Anfangsgr\xfcnde der Naturwissenschaft [Metaphysical principles of natural science], Kant says: \\"Now to cognize something *a priori* means to cognize it from its mere possibility.\\" Consequently, *a priori* means that which makes beings as beings possible in *what* and *how* they are. But why is this possibility labeled by the term \\"earlier\\"? Obviously not because we recognize it earlier than beings. For what we experience first and foremost is beings, that which is; we recognize Being only later or maybe even not at all. This time-determination \\"earlier\\" cannot refer to the temporal order given by the common concept of time in the sense of intratemporality. On the other hand, it cannot be denied that a time determination is present in the concept of the *a priori*, the earlier. But, because it is not seen how the interpretation of Being necessarily occurs in the horizon of time, the effort has to be made to explain away the time determination by means of the *a priori*. Some go so far as to say that the *a priori*\u2015the essentialities, the determination of beings in their Being\u2015is extratemporal, supratemporal, timeless. That which does the enabling, the possibilities are characterized by a time-determination, the earlier, because in this *a priori* nothing of time is supposed to be present, hence *locus a non lucendo*? Believe it if you wish.\\"\u2015from_The Basic Problems of Phenomenology_","Has Dasein as itself ever freely decided, and will it ever be able to decide, whether it wants to come into \\"Dasein\\" or not?","Everything has always already been said. And yet this \\"same\\" possesses, as its inner truth, the inexhaustable wealth of what is on every day as if that day were its first.","In provisionally characterizing the object which serves as the theme of our investigation (the Being of entities, or the meaning of Being in general), it seems that we have also delineated the method to be employed. The task of ontology is to explain Being itself and to make the Being of entities stand out in full relief. And the method of ontology remains questionable in the highest degree as long as we merely consult those ontologies which have come down to us historically, or other essays of that character. Since the term \\"ontology\\" is used in this investigation in a sense which is formally broad, any attempt to clarify the method of ontology by tracing its history is automatically ruled out. When, moreover, we use the term \\"ontology,\\" we are not talking about some definite philosophical discipline standing in interconnection with the others. Here one does not have to measure up to the tasks of some discipline that has been presented beforehand; on the contrary, only in terms of the objective necessities of definite questions and the kind of treatment which the \'things themselves\' require, can one develop such a discipline. With the question of the meaning of Being, our investigation comes up against the fundamental question of philosophy. This is one that must be treated *phenomenologically*. Thus our treatise does not subscribe to a \'standpoint\' or represent any special \'direction\'; for phenomenology is nothing of either sort, nor can it become so as long as it understands itself. The expression \'phenomenology\' signifies primarily a *methodological conception*. This expression does not characterize the what of the objects of philosophical research as subject-matter, but rather the *how* of that research. The more genuinely a methodological concept is worked out and the more comprehensively it determines the principles on which a science is to be conducted, all the more primordially is it rooted in the way we come to terms with the things themselves, and the farther is it removed from what we call \\"technical devices,\\" though there are many such devices even in the theoretical disciplines. Thus the term \'phenomenology\' expresses a maxim which can be formulated as \'To the things themselves!\' It is opposed to all free-floating constructions and accidental findings; it is opposed to taking over any conceptions which only seem to have been demonstrated; it is opposed to those pseudo-questions which parade themselves as \'problems\', often for generations at a time. Yet this maxim, one may rejoin, is abundantly self-evident, and it expresses, moreover, the underlying principle of any scientific knowledge whatsoever. Why should anything so self-evident be taken up explicitly in giving a title to a branch of research? In point of fact, the issue here is a kind of \'self-evidence\' which we should like to bring closer to us, so far as it is important to do so in casting light upon the procedure of our treatise. We shall expound only the preliminary conception [Vorbegriff] of phenomenology. This expression has two components: \\"phenomenon\\" and \\"logos.\\" Both of these go back to terms from the Greek: \u03c6\u03b1\u03b9\u03bd\u03cc\u03bc\u03b5\u03bd\u03bf\u03bd and \u03bb\u03cc\u03b3\u03bf\u03c2. Taken superficially, the term \\"phenomenology\\" is formed like \\"theology,\\" \\"biology,\\" \\"sociology\\"\u2015names which may be translated as \\"science of God,\\" \\"science of life,\\" \\"science of society.\\" This would make phenomenology the *science of phenomena*. We shall set forth the preliminary conception of phenomenology by characterizing what one has in mind in the term\'s two components, \'phenomenon\' and \'logos\', and by establishing the meaning of the name in which these are *put together*. The history of the word itself, which presumably arose in the Wolffian school, is here of no significance.\\"\u2015from_Being and Time_. Translated by John Macquarrie & Edward Robinson, pp. 49-51","Sartre expresses the basic tenet of existentialism in this way: Existence precedes essence. In this statement he is taking existentia and essentia according to their metaphysical meaning, which from Plato\'s time on has said that essentia precedes existentia. Sartre reverses this statement. But the reversal of a metaphysical statement remains a metaphysical statement. With it he stays with metaphysics in oblivion of the truth of Being.","Man obviously is a being. As such he belongs to the totality of Being\u2014just like the stone, the tree, or the eagle. But man\'s distinctive feature lies in this, that he, as the being who thinks, is open to Being, face to face with Being; thus man remains referred to Being and so answers to it. Man is essentially this relationship of responding to Being, and he is only this.","in the collapse becomes the bringing-forth-hither which at once brings the \u201chither as clearing (\u201cthere\u201d) and the \u201cforth\u201d as presence. In this bringing is gathered the staying which belongs to presence, i.e., the tarrying\u2014as the sojourning of presence in unconcealedness. Tarrying [Verbringen], thought according to the bringing-forth-hither, names the protracted presencing\u2014out of which essentially occurs the constant presence that is determinative of \u201cbeing\u201d in metaphysics. This determination includes the positedness of the being of beings (\u03a0\u03bf\u03af\u03b7\u03c3\u03b9\u03c2). This positedness is, to be sure, unexperienceable since it is distorted for metaphysics and through metaphysics. Although it is as such unrecognizable, it comes to light inasmuch as being is effected and, in the broadest sense, conditioned: effected by the first cause (ipsum esse as actus purus), conditioned by the conditions of necessity and universality (esse as objective reality), and, finally, conditioned as having become dialectical\u2014in the coupling of both modes of grounding.\u201d","But how does it come about that while the \u2018I think\u2019 gives Kant a genuine phenomenal starting-point, he cannot exploit it ontologically, and has to fall back on the \u2018subject\u2019\u2014that is to say, something *substantial*? The \u201cI is not just an \u2018I think\u2019, but an \u2018I think something\u2019. And does not Kant himself keep on stressing that the \u201cI\u201d remains related to its representations, and would be nothing without them?For Kant, however, these representations are the \u2018empirical\u2019, which is \u2018accompanied\u2019 by the \u201cI\u201d\u2014the appearances to which the \u201cI\u201d \u2018clings\u2019. Kant nowhere shows the kind of Being of this \u2018clinging\u2019 and \u2018accompanying\u2019. At bottom, however, their kind of Being is understood as the constant Being-present-at-hand of the \u201cI\u201d along with its representations. Kant has indeed avoided cutting the \u201cI\u201d adrift from thinking; but he has done so without starting with the \u2018I think\u2019 itself in its full essential content as an \u2018I think something\u2019, and above all, without seeing what is ontologically \u2018presupposed\u2019 in taking the \u2018I think something\u2019 as a basic characteristic of the Self. For even the \u2018I think something\u2019 is not definite enough ontologically as a starting-point, because the \u2018something\u2019 remains indefinite. If by this \u201csomething\u201d we understand an entity *within-the-world*, then it tacitly implies that the *world* has been presupposed; and this very phenomenon of the world co-determines the state of Being of the \u201cI,\u201d if indeed it is to be possible for the \u201cI\u201d to be something like an \u2018I think something\u2019. In saying \u201cI,\u201d I have in view the entity which in each case I am as an \u2018I-am-in-a-world\u2019. Kant did not see the phenomenon of the world, and was consistent enough to keep the \u2018representations\u2019 apart from the *a priori* content of the \u2018I think\u2019. But as a consequence the \u201cI\u201d was again forced back to an *isolated* subject, accompanying representations in a way which is ontologically quite indefinite.*In saying \u201cI,\u201d Dasein expresses itself as Being-in-the-world*. But does saying \u201cI\u201d in the everyday manner have *itself* in view *as* being-in-the-world [*in-der-Welt-seiend*]? Here we must make a distinction. When saying \u201cI,\u201d Dasein surely has in view the entity which, in every case, it is itself. The everyday interpretation of the Self, however, has a tendency to understand itself in terms of the \u2018world\u2019 with which it is concerned. When Dasein has itself in view ontically, it *fails to see* itself in relation to the kind of Being of that entity which it is itself. And this holds especially for the basic state of Dasein, Being-in-the-world.\\"\u2015from_Being and Time_. Translated by John Macquarrie & Edward Robinson, pp. 367-370\u201d","Curiosity is everywhere and nowhere. This mode of Being-in-the-world reveals a new kind of Being of everyday Dasein\u2015a kind in which Dasein is constantly uprooting itself.Idle talk controls even the ways in which one may be curious. It says what one \\"must\\" have read and seen. In being everywhere and nowhere, curiosity is delivered over to idle talk. These two everyday modes of Being for discourse and sight are not just present-at-hand side by side in their tendency to uproot, but *either* of these ways-to-be drags the *other* one with it. Curiosity, for which nothing is closed off, and idle talk, for which there is nothing that is not understood, provide themselves (that is, the Dasein which is in this manner [*dem so seienden Dasein*]) with the guarantee of a \'life\' which, supposedly, is genuinely \'lively\'.

Saying is in no way the linguistic expression added to the phenomena after they have appeared\u2014rather, all radiant appearance and all fading away is grounded in the showing Saying. Saying sets all present beings free into their given presence, and brings what is absent into their absence.

Unless the strict relation between \u1f00\u03bb\u1f75\u03b8\u03b5\u03b9\u03b1 and openness is maintained, the essence of the open, as that essence is understood within the history of beyng, can never be thought with essential legitimacy.

To be sure, this has happened only where beings have become objects, because at the same time the being of beings is no longer appreciated in its essence but, instead, is taken to be purely decided: precisely as the certain, what is bent back to in \u201creflexion,\u201d and, thus fastened down, the secured. This lack of appreciation of being is, in the mode of the oblivion of being, a proper mode of the truth of beings, a mode that all the more testifies to the essential occurrence of being, i.e., to the disconcealment of the open.\u201d","No historical movement can leap outside of history and start from scratch.","Each one of us is what he pursues and cares for.

Not reflexivity, but its opposite: decision about the decision, i.e., already knowing the event. Decision and question; questioning as more originary: placing the essence of truth up for decision.","Yet Being\u2014what is Being? It is It itself. The thinking that is to come must learn to experience that and to say it. \\"Being\\"\u2014that is not God and not a cosmic ground. Being is farther than all beings and is yet nearer to man than every being, be it a rock, a beast, a work of art, a machine, be it an angel or God. Being is the nearest. Yet the near remains farthest from man. Man at first clings always and only to beings. But when thinking represents beings as beings it no doubt relates itself to Being. In truth, however, it always thinks only of beings as such; precisely not, and never, Being as such. The \\"question of Being\\" always remains a question about beings. It is still not at all what its elusive name indicates: the question in the direction of Being. Philosophy, even when it becomes \\"critical\\" through Descartes and Kant, always follows the course of metaphysical representation. It thinks from beings back to beings with a glance in passing toward Being. For every departure from beings and every return to them stands already in the light of Being","The essence of being in the first beginning reveals itself, i.e., at the same time, essentially occurs inceptually, in emerging, advancing. Only if the basic traits of the inceptuality come to be recollected constantly, above all in their inceptual unity, can the first beginning be surmised. Being is the beginning. The beginning is disconcealment toward unconcealedness (\u0410\u039b\u041d\u0398\u0395\u0406\u0410). Disconcealment is the emerging that goes back into itself, because disconcealment possesses the concealment out of which it emerges. Emergence is \u03c6\u1f7b\u03c3\u03b9\u03c2. Emergence is presence (\u03bf\u1f50\u03c3\u03af\u03b1).

Presence consists in constancy and is then permanence (\u1f00\u03b5\u03af). Presence is then the essential occurrence in the work and as work, wherein is gathered the presentness of rest and motion: \u1f10\u03bd\u1f73\u03c1\u03b3\u03b5\u03b9\u03b1; \u1f10\u03bd\u03c4\u03b5\u03bb\u1f73\u03c7\u03b5\u03b9\u03b1.

Every emerged determination of being can in a certain way stand for the beginning, and all of them can be especially attributed to the beginning. And yet they do not exhaust it, because it itself, as the first beginning, must take over the advancement. Nevertheless, the beginning remains embedded in concealment, but one which itself remains concealed and thus is completely lacking in presence and so must be replaced by \u201ctruth as \u1f41\u03bc\u03bf\u03af\u03c9\u03c3\u03b9\u03c2 and as disfigurement of the cognizing human being.\u201d","When we say something about something, we make it lie there before us, which means at the same time to make it appear.","[I]n the name \u2018being-in-the-world,\u2019 \u2018world\u2019 does not in any way imply earthly as opposed to heavenly being, nor the \u2018worldly\u2019 as opposed to the \u2018spiritual.\u2019 For us \u2018world\u2019 does not at all signify beings or any realm of beings but the openness of Being.

In Greek, to assign is nemein. Nomos is not only law but more originally the assignment contained in the dispensation of Being. Only the assignment is capable of dispatching man into Being. Only such dispatching is capable of supporting and obligating. Otherwise all law remains merely something fabricated by human reason. More essential than instituting rules is that man find the way to his abode in the truth of Being. This abode first yields the experience of something we can hold on to. The truth of Being offers a hold for all conduct. \\"Hold\\" in our language means protective heed. Being is the protective heed that holds man in his ek-sistent essence to the truth of such protective heed-in such a way that it houses eksistence in language. Thus language is at once the house of Being and the home of human beings. Only because language is the home of the essence of man can historical mankind and human beings not be at home in their language, so that for them language becomes a mere container for their sundry preoccupations.But now in what relation does the thinking of Being stand to theoretical and practical behavior? It exceeds all contemplation because it cares for the light in which a seeing, as theoria, can first live and move. Thinking attends to the clearing of Being in that it puts its saying of Being into language as the home of ek-sistence. Thus thinking is a deed. But a deed that also surpasses all praxis. Thinking towers above action and production, not through the grandeur of its achievement and not as a consequence of its effect, but through the humbleness of its inconsequential accomplishment","If one interprets [Plato\'s] ideas as representations and thoughts that contain a value, a norm, a law, a rule, such that ideas then become conceived of as norms, then the one subject to these norms is the human being\u2013not the historical human being, but rather the human being in general, the human being in itself. Here, the conception of the human being is one of a rational being in general. In the Enlightenment and in liberalism, this conception achieves a definite form.

This raises the question of the character of method in ontology. Thus we come to the third part of the course: the scientific method of ontology and the idea of phenomenology. The method of ontology, that is, of philosophy in general, is distinguished by the fact that ontology has nothing in common with any method of any of the other sciences, all of which as positive sciences deal with beings. On the other hand, it is precisely the analysis of the truth-character of Being which shows that Being also is, as it were, based in a being, namely, in the Dasein. Being is given only if the understanding of Being, hence the Dasein, exists. This being accordingly lays claim to a distinctive priority in ontological inquiry. It makes itself manifest in all discussions of the basic problems of ontology and above all in the fundamental question of the meaning of Being in general. The elaboration of this question and its answer requires a general analytic of the Dasein. Ontology has for its fundamental discipline the analytic of the Dasein. This implies at the same time that ontology cannot be established in a purely ontological manner. Its possibility is referred back to a being, that is, to something ontical\u2015the Dasein. Ontology has an ontical foundation, a fact which is manifest over and over again in the history of philosophy down to the present. For example, it is expressed as early as Aristotle\'s dictum that the first science, the science of Being, is theology. As the work of the freedom of the human Dasein, the possibilities and destinies of philosophy are bound up with man\'s existence, and thus with temporality and with historicality, and indeed in a more original sense than is any other science. Consequently, in clarifying the scientific character of ontology, *the first task is the demonstration of its ontical foundation* and the characterisation of this foundation itself.\\"\u2015from_The Basic Problems of Phenomenology_","On ne peut entreprendre de d\xe9finir l\u2019\xeatre sans tomber dans cette absurdit\xe9: car on ne peut d\xe9finir un mot sans commencer par celui-ci, c\u2019est, soit qu\u2019on l\u2019exprime ou qu\u2019on le sous-entende.

To be sure, as long as we orient ourselves toward the common concept of time we are at an impasse, and negatively it is no less than consistent to deny dogmatically that the *a priori* has anything to do with time. However, time in the sense commonly understood, which is our topic here, is indeed only one derivative, even if legitimate, of the original time, on which the Dasein\'s ontological constitution is based. *It is only by means of the Temporality of the understanding of Being that it can be explained why the ontological determinations of Being have the character of apriority*. We shall attempt to sketch this briefly, as far as it permits of being done along general lines.We have just seen that all comportment toward beings already understands Being, and not just incidentally: Being must necessarily be understood precursorily (pre-cecently). The possibility of comportment toward beings demands a precursory understanding of Being, and the possibility of the understanding of Being demands in its turn a precursory projection upon time. But where is the final stage of this demand for ever further precursory conditions? It is temporality itself as the basic constitution of the Dasein. Temporality, due to its horizonal-ecstatic nature, makes possible *at once* the understanding of Being and comportment toward beings; therefore, that which does the enabling as well as the enablings themselves, that is, the possibilities in the Kantian sense, are \\"temporal,\\" that is to say, Temporal, in their specific interconnection. Because the original determinant of possibility, the origin of possibility itself, is time, time temporalizes itself as the absolutely earliest. *Time is earlier than any possible earlier* of whatever sort, because it is the basic condition for an earlier as such. And because time as the source of all enablings (possibilities) is the earliest, all possibilities as such in their possibility-making function have the character of the earlier. That is to say, they are *a priori*. But, from the fact that time is the earliest in the sense of being the possibility of every earlier and of every *a priori* foundational ordering, it does not follow that time is ontically the first being; nor does it follow that time is forever and eternal, quite apart from the impropriety of calling time a being at all. \u2015from_The Basic Problems of Phenomenology_\u201d","the more concretely I am in the world, the more genuine the existence of deception.","Why is love rich beyond all other possible human experiences and a sweet burden to those seized in its grasp?

And yet, how else are we to bring the \\"It\\" into view which wesay when we say \\"It gives Being,\\" \\"It gives time\\"? Simply by think-\'ing the \\"It\\" in the light ofthe kind ofgiving that belongs to it: givingas destiny, giving as an opening up which reaches out.

In *saying* \u201c*I*, Dasein expresses itself about \u2018itself\u2019. It is not necessary that in doing so Dasein should make any utterance. With the \u2018I\u2019, this entity has itself in view. The content of this expression is regarded as something utterly simple. In each case, it just stands for me and nothing further. Also, this \u2018I\u2019, as something simple, is not an attribute of other Things; it is not *itself* a predicate, but the absolute \u2018subject\u2019. What is expressed and what is addressed in saying \u201cI,\u201d is always met as the same persisting something. The characteristics of \u2018simplicity\u2019, \u2018substantiality\u2019, and \u2018personality\u2019, which Kant, for instance, made the basis for his doctrine \u2018of the paralogisms of pure reason\u2019, arise from a genuine pre-phenomenological experience. The question remains whether that which we have experienced ontically in this way may be Interpreted ontologically with the help of the \u2018categories\u2019 mentioned.Kant, indeed, in strict conformity with the phenomenal content given in saying \u201cI,\u201d shows that the ontical theses about the soul-substance which have been inferred [*erschlossenen*] from these characteristics, are without justification. But in so doing, he merely rejects a wrong *ontical* explanation of the \u201cI\u201d; he has by no means achieved an *ontological* Interpretation of Selfhood, nor has he even obtained some assurance of it and made positive preparation for it. Kant makes a more rigorous attempt than his predecessors to keep hold of the phenomenal content of saying \u201cI\u201d; yet even though in theory he has denied that the ontical foundations of the ontology of the substantial apply to the \u201cI,\u201d he still slips back into *this same* inappropriate ontology. This will be shown more exactly, in order that we may establish what it means ontologically to take saying \u201cI\u201d as the starting point for the analysis of Selfhood. The Kantian analysis of the \u2018I think\u2019 is now to be added as an illustration, but only so far as is demanded for clarifying these problems.\\"\u2015from_Being and Time_. Translated by John Macquarrie & Edward Robinson, p. 366\u201d","The \u2018I\u2019 is a bare consciousness, accompanying all concepts. In the \u2018I\u2019, \u2018nothing more is represented than a transcendental subject of thoughts\u2019. \u2018Consciousness in itself (is) not so much a representation\u2026as it is a form of representation in general.\u2019 The \u2018I think\u2019 is \u2018the form of apperception, which clings to every experience and precedes it.\u2019Kant grasps the phenomenal content of the \u2018I\u2019 correctly in the expression \u2018I think\u2019, or\u2014if one also pays heed to including the \u2018practical person\u2019 when one speaks of \u2018intelligence\u2019\u2014in the expression \u2018I take action\u2019. In Kant\u2019s sense we must take saying \u201cI as saying \u201cI think.\u201d Kant tries to establish the phenomenal content of the \u201cI\u201d as *res cogitans*. If in doing so he calls this \u201cI\u201d a \u2018logical subject\u2019, that does not mean that the \u201cI\u201d in general is a concept obtained merely by way of logic. The \u201cI\u201d is rather the subject of logical behavior, of binding together. \u2018I think\u2019 means \u2018I bind together\u2019. All binding together is an \u2018*I* bind together\u2019. In any taking-together or relating, the \u201cI\u201d always underlies\u2014the \u1f51\u03c0\u03bf\u03ba\u03b5\u03af\u03bc\u03b5\u03bd\u03bf\u03bd [hypokeimenon; subjectum; subject]. The *subjectum* is therefore \u2018consciousness in itself\u2019, not a representation but rather the \u2018form\u2019 of representation. That is to say, the \u201cI think\u201d is not something represented, but the formal structure of representing as such, and this formal structure alone makes it possible for anything to have been represented. When we speak of the \u201cform\u201d of representation, we have in view neither a framework nor a universal concept, but that which, as \u03b5\u1f36\u03b4\u03bf\u03c2 [eidos], makes every representing and everything represented be what it is. If the \u201cI\u201d is understood as the form of representation, this amounts to saying that it is the \u2018logical subject\u2019.Kant\u2019s analysis has two positive aspects. For one thing, he sees the impossibility of ontically reducing the \u201cI\u201d to a substance; for another thing, he holds fast to the \u201cI\u201d as \u2018I think\u2019. Nevertheless, he takes this \u201cI\u201d as subject again, and he does so in a sense which is ontologically inappropriate. For the ontological concept of the subject *characterizes not the Selfhood of the \u201cI\u201d qua Self, but the self-sameness and steadiness of something that is always present-at-hand*. To define the \u201cI\u201d ontologically as \u201c*subject*\u201d means to regard it as something always present-at-hand. The Being of the \u201cI\u201d is understood as the Reality of the *res cogitans*.\\"\u2015from_Being and Time_. Translated by John Macquarrie & Edward Robinson, pp. 366-367\u201d","Philosophy is metaphysics. Metaphysics thinks beings as a whole\u2015the world, man, God\u2015with respect to Being, with respect to the belonging together of beings in Being. Metaphysics thinks beings as being in the manner of representational thinking which gives reasons. For since the beginning of philosophy and with that beginning, the Being of beings has showed itself as the ground (arche, aition, principle). The ground is that from which beings as such are what they are in their becoming, perishing, and persisting as something that can be known, handled, and worked upon. As the ground, Being brings beings to their actual presencing. The ground shows itself as presence. The present of presence consists in the fact that it brings what is present each in its own way to presence. In accordance with the actual kind of presence, the ground has the character of grounding as the ontic causation of the real, as the transcendental making possible of the objectivity of objects, as the dialectical mediation of the movement of the absolute Spirit and of the historical process of production, as the will to power positing values.\\"\u2015from_The End of Philosophy and the Task of Thinking_","Asking the question of being is one of the essential and fundamental conditions for the awakening of spirit and hence for an originary world of historical Dasein. It is indispensable if the peril of world-darkening [Weltverd\xfcsterung] is to be forestalled and if our Volk at the center of the West is to take on its historical mission.","Questioning is the piety of thought","Tendri\u0301amos que aprender a reconocer que las cosas mismas son los lugares y que no se limitan a pertenecer a un lugar.","Human existence can relate to beings only if it holds itself out into the nothing. Going beyond beings occurs in the essence of Dasein. But this going beyond is metaphysics itself. This implies that metaphysics belongs to the \\"nature of man.\\" It is neither a division of academic philosophy nor a field of arbitrary notions. Metaphysics is the basic occurrence of Dasein. It is Dasein itself. Because the truth of metaphysics dwells in this groundless ground it stands in closest proximity to the constantly lurking possibility of deepest error. For this reason no amount of scientific rigor attains to the seriousness of metaphysics. Philosophy can never be measured by the standard of the idea of science.If the question of the nothing unfolded here has actually questioned us, then we have not simply brought metaphysics before us in an extrinsic manner. Nor have we merely been \\"transposed\\" to it. We cannot be transposed there at all, because insofar as we exist we are always there already. \\"For by nature, my friend, man\'s mind dwells in philosophy\\" (Plato, Phaedrus, 279a). So long as man exists, philosophizing of some sort occurs. Philosophy\u2015what we call philosophy\u2015is metaphysics getting under way, in which philosophy comes to itself and to its explicit tasks. Philosophy gets under way only by a peculiar insertion of our own existence into the fundamental possibilities of Dasein as a whole. For this insertion it is of decisive importance, first, that we allow space for beings as a whole; second, that we release ourselves into the nothing, which is to say, that we liberate ourselves from those idols everyone has and to which he is wont to go cringing; and finally, that we let the sweep of our suspense take its full course, so that it swings back into the basic question of metaphysics which the nothing itself compels: \'Why are there beings at all, and why not rather nothing?\'\\"\u2015from_What is Metaphysics?_","\xbfY que\u0301 seri\u0301a del vaci\u0301o del espacio?

Nietzsche\'s thought on the slave revolt with respect to morality), Bolshevism is in fact Jewish; but then Christianity is also fundamentally Bolshevist! And what are the decisions that become necessary on that basis?). But the danger of the question \\"Who are we?\\" is at the same time--if danger can necessitate what is highest--the sole path by which to succeed in coming to ourselves and thus in initiating the original salvation, that is, the justification of the Occident on the basis of its history. The danger of this question is in itself so essential for us that it loses the appearance of opposition to the new German will.","When around one everything has become silent, solemn as a clear, starlit night, when the soul comes to be alone in the whole world, then before one there appears, not an extraordinary human being, but the eternal power itself, then the heavens seem to open, and the I chooses itself or, more correctly, receives itself. Then the soul has seen the highest, which no mortal eye can see and which can never be forgotten; then the personality receives the accolade of knighthood that ennobles it for an eternity. He does not become someone other than he was before, but he becomes himself. The consciousness integrates, and he is himself. Just as an heir, even if he were heir to the treasures of the whole world, does not possess them before he has come of age, so the richest personality is nothing before he has chosen himself, for the greatness is not to be this or that but to be oneself.","What is the motive for this \u2018fugitive\u2019 way of saying \u201cI? It is motivated by Dasein\u2019s falling; for as falling, it *flees* in the face of itself into the \u201cthey.\u201d When the \u201cI\u201d talks in the \u2018natural\u2019 manner, this is performed by the they-self. What expresses itself in the \u2018I\u2019 is that Self which, proximally and for the most part, I am *not* authentically. When one is absorbed in the everyday multiplicity and the rapid succession [*Sich-jagen] of that with which one is concerned, the Self of the self-forgetful \u201cI am concerned\u201d shows itself as something simple which is constantly selfsame but indefinite and empty. Yet one *is* that with which one concerns oneself. In the \u2018natural\u2019 ontical way in which the \u201cI\u201d talks, the phenomenal content of the Dasein which one has in view in the \\"I\\" gets overlooked; but this gives *no justification for our joining in this overlooking of it*, or for forcing upon the problematic of the Self an inappropriate \u2018categorial\u2019 horizon when we Interpret the \u201cI\u201d ontologically.Of course by thus refusing to follow the everyday way in which the \u201cI\u201d talks, our ontological Interpretation of the \u2018I\u2019 has by no means *solved* the problem; but it has indeed *prescribed the direction* for any further inquiries. In the \u201cI,\u201d we have in view that entity which one is in \u2018being-in-the-world\u2019.Being-already-in-a-world, however, as Being-alongside-the-ready-to-hand-within-the-world, means equiprimordially that one is ahead of oneself. With the \u2018I\u2019, what we have in view is that entity for which the *issue* is the Being of the entity that it is. With the \u2018I\u2019, care expresses itself, though proximally and for the most part in the \u2018fugitive\u2019 way in which the \u201cI\u201d talks when it concerns itself with something. The they-self keeps on saying \u201cI\u201d most loudly and most frequently because at bottom it *is not authentically* itself, and evades its authentic potentiality-for-Being. If the ontological constitution of the Self is not to be traced back either to an \u201cI\u201d-substance or to a \u2018subject\u2019, but if, on the contrary, the everyday fugitive way in which we keep on saying \u201cI\u201d must be understood in terms of our *authentic* potentiality-for-Being, then the proposition that the Self is the basis of care and constantly present-at-hand, is one that still does not follow. Selfhood is to be discerned existentially only in one\u2019s authentic potentiality-for-Being-one\u2019s-Self\u2014that is to say, in the authenticity of Dasein\u2019s Being *as care*. In terms of care the *constancy of the Self*, as the supposed persistence of the *subjectum*, gets clarified. But the phenomenon of this authentic potentiality-for-Being also opens our eyes for the *constancy of the Self*, in the double sense of steadiness and steadfastness, is the *authentic* counter-possibility to the non-Self-constancy which is characteristic of irresolute falling. Existentially, \u201c*Self-constancy*\u201d signifies nothing other than anticipatory resoluteness. The ontological structure of such resoluteness reveals the existentiality of the Self\u2019s Selfhood.\\"\u2015from_Being and Time_. Translated by John Macquarrie & Edward Robinson, pp. 368-369\u201d","In order to be who we are, we human beings remain committed to and within the being of language, and can never step out of it and look at it from somewhere else. Thus we always see the nature of language only to the extent to which language itself has us in view, has appropriated us to itself. That we cannot know the nature of language\u2014know it according to the traditional concept of knowledge defined in terms of cognition as representation\u2014is not a defect, however, but rather an advantage by which we are favored with a special realm, that realm where we, who are needed and used to speak language, dwell as mortals.","Dasein *is authentically itself* in the primordial individualization of the reticent resoluteness which exacts anxiety of itself. *As something that keeps *silent*, authentic *Being*-one\u2019s-Self is just the sort of thing that does not keep on saying \u2018I\u2019; but in its reticence it \u2018*is*\u2019 that thrown entity as which it can authentically be. The Self which the reticence of resolute existence unveils is the primordial phenomenal basis for the question as to the Being of the \u2018I\u2019. Only if we are oriented phenomenally by the meaning of the Being of the authentic potentiality-for-Being-one\u2019s-Self are we put in a position to discuss what ontological justification there is for treating substantiality, simplicity, and personality as characteristics of Selfhood. In the prevalent way of saying \u201cI, it is constantly suggested that what we have in advance is a Self-Thing, persistently present-at-hand; the ontological question of the Being of the Self must turn away from any such suggestion.*Care does not need to be founded in a Self. But existentiality, as constitutive for care, provides the ontological constitution of Dasein\u2019s Self-constancy, to which there belongs, in accordance with the full structural content of care, its Being-fallen factically into non-Self-constancy*. When fully conceived, the care-structure includes the phenomenon of Selfhood. This phenomenon is clarified by Interpreting the meaning of care; and it is as care that Dasein\u2019s totality of Being has been defined.\u201d\u2015from_Being and Time_. Translated by John Macquarrie & Edward Robinson, pp. 369-370\u201d","All metaphysics, including its opponent, positivism, speaks the language of Plato. The basic word of its thinking, that is, of its presentation of the Being of beings, is eidos, idea: the outward appearance in which beings as such show themselves. Outward appearance, however, is a manner of presence. No outward appearance without light \u2013 Plato already knew this. But there is no light and no brightness without the clearing. Even darkness needs it.","Thought has the gift of thinking back, a gift given because we incline toward it","There is much talk nowadays of blood and soil [Blut und Boden] as frequently invoked powers.

If it were, then we would incontestably have to recognize it as something which is and consequently discover it as suchamong other beings. This lecture hall is. The lecture hall is illuminated.

When a man dies and is removed from what is here, frombeings here and there, we say that his time has come. Time and thetemporal mean what is perishable, what passes away in the course oftime. Our language says with still greater precision: what passes awaywith time. For time itself passes away. But by passing away constantly, time remains as time. To remain means: not to disappear,thus, to presence. Thus time is determined by a kind of Being. How,then, is Being supposed to be determined by time?

And in the turning: The event must require Dasein and, in needing it, must place it in the call and thereby bring it before the passing by of the last god. The turning essentially occurs in between the call (to the one that belongs) and the belonging (of the one that is called): the turning is a counter-turning. The call to the leap into the appropriation is the great stillness of the most concealed self-knowledge. Every language of Da-sein originates here and is thus in essence silence (cf. restraint, event, truth, and language). As counter-turning, the event \u201cis therefore the highest reign over the advent and absconding of the past gods. The most extreme god needs beyng. The call is intrusion and remaining absent in the mystery of the appropriation. Playing out in the turning are the intimations of the last god as the intrusion and remaining absent of the advent and absconding of the gods and of their abode of sovereignty. In these intimations the law of the last god is intimated, the law of the great individuation in Da-sein, of the solitude of the sacrifice, and of the uniqueness of the choice regarding the shortest and steepest path. In the essence of the intimation lies the mystery of the unity of the innermost nearing in the most extreme distance, the traversal of the broadest temporal-spatial playing field of beyng. This extremity of the essential occurrence of beyng requires what is most intrinsic in the plight of the abandonment by being. This plight must belong and listen to the call of the reigning of that intimation. What resonates and spreads out in such listening is first able to prepare for the strife of earth and world, i.e., for the truth of the \u201cthere\u201d and, through the \u201cthere,\u201d for the site of the moment of the decision and so for the playing out of the strife and thus for the sheltering in beings. Whether this call of the extreme intimation, this most concealed appropriation, still happens openly, or whether the plight becomes mute instead and all reigning is withheld, and whether the call is still taken up, provided it does happen at all, and whether the leap into Da-sein and thus, out of the truth of the latter, the turning still become history\u2014therein is decided the future of humans. They may for centuries still ravish and devastate the planet with their machinations, and the monstrousness of this drive may \u201cdevelop\u201d to an inconceivable extent, assume the form of an apparent strictness, and become the measuring regulation of the devastated as such; the greatness of beyng will remain closed off, since decisions about truth and untruth and their essence no longer arise. All that matters is the calculation of the success and failure of the machinations. This calculation extends into a presumed \u201ceternity,\u201d which is not such but is only the endless \u201cand so on\u201d of what is most desolate and most fleeting. Where the truth of being is not willed, not incorporated into a willing of knowledge and experience, into a questioning, there all timespace is withdrawn from the moment, i.e., from the flashing up of beyng out of the enduring of the simple and always incalculable event. Or else the moment still belongs only to the most solitary solitudes, although these are denied a grounding comprehension of the instituting of a history. Yet these moments, and they alone, can become the preparations in which the turning of the event unfolds into truth and joins truth. Indeed, only pure persistence in the simple and essential, which are uncompellable, is mature enough for the preparation of such preparedness; the fleetingness of the frenetically self-surpassing machinations is never so mature.\u201d","Within certain limits terminology is always arbitrary. But the definition of being-true as unveiling, making manifest, is not an arbitrary, private invention of mine; it only gives expression to the understanding of the phenomenon of truth, as the Greeks already understood it in a pre-scientific as well as philosophical understanding, even if not in every respect in an originally explicit way. Plato already says explicitly that the function of logos, of assertion, is deloun, making plain, or as Aristotle says more exactly with regard to the Greek expression of truth: aletheuein.

Or should we not first be ableto hear and understand all these words carefully if we are to be permirtedas human beings, that is, as eksistent creatures, to experience a relation ofGod to human beings? How can the human being at the present stage ofworld history ask at all seriously and rigorously whether the god nears orwithdraws, when he has above all neglected to think into the dimensionin which alone that question can be asked?

On account of this priority in the way of approach to organization and arrangement, both groups of sciences come into agreement with regard to the essential, i.e., with regard to their character as business establishments. This \u201cdevelopment\u201d of modern science, its coming into its essence, is visible today only to a few and will be rejected by most as nonexistent. It cannot be proven by matters of fact; instead, it can be grasped only out of a knowledge of the history of being. Many \u201cresearchers\u201d will still think of themselves as belonging to the reliable traditions of the nineteenth century. Just that many will still find in relation to their objects new and richer content as well as satisfaction and will perhaps incorporate this content into their overall theory. Yet none of this disproves the procedure in which the entire institution known as \u201cscience\u201d is irrevocably caught up. Not only will science never be able to extricate itself from that procedure, but it will also, and above all, never want to do so.

And the transcendence of Dasein\'s Being is distinctive in that it implies the possibility and the necessity of the most radical *individuation*. Every disclosure of Being as the *transcendens* is *transcendental* knowledge. *Phenomenological truth (the disclosedness of Being) is veritas transcendentalis*.Ontology and phenomenology are not two distinct philosophical disciplines among others. These terms characterize philosophy itself with regard to its object and its way of treating that object.

[ss. 136-137]","The *second task* consists in distinguishing the mode of knowing operative in ontology as science of Being, and this requires us to *work out the methodological structure of ontological-transcendental differentiation*. In early antiquity it was already seen that Being and its attributes in a certain way underlie beings and precede them and so are *a proteron*, an earlier. The term denoting this character by which Being precedes beings is the expression *a priori*, *apriority*, being earlier or prior. As *a priori*, Being is earlier than beings. The meaning of this *a priori*, the sense of the earlier and its possibility, has never been cleared up. The question has not even once been raised as to why the determinations of Being and Being itself must have this character of priority and how such priority is possible. To be earlier is a determination of time, but it does not pertain to the temporal order of the time that we measure by the clock; rather, it is an earlier that belongs to the \\"inverted world.\\" Therefore, this earlier which characterises Being is taken by the popular understanding to be the later. Only the interpretation of Being by way of temporality can make clear why and how this feature of being earlier, apriority, goes together with Being. The *a priori* character of Being and of all the structures of Being accordingly calls for a specific kind of approach and way of apprehending Being\u2015*a priori cognition*.The basic components of *a priori* cognition constitute what we call *phenomenology*. Phenomenology is the name for the method of ontology, that is, of scientific philosophy. Rightly conceived, phenomenology is the concept of a method. It is therefore precluded from the start that phenomenology should pronounce any theses about Being which have specific content, thus adopting a so-called standpoint.\\" \u2015Martin Heidegger, from_The Basic Problems of Phenomenology_","Sein \u2013 nicht Seiendes \u2013 \xbbgibt es\xab nur, sofern Wahrheit ist.

However, such endeavors, their success or failure, depend primarily, in accordance with our discussion, on how far phenomenology has assured for itself the object of philosophy\u2015how far, in accordance with its own principle, it is unbiased enough in the face of what the things themselves demand. We cannot now enter any further into the essential and fundamental constituent parts of this method. In fact, we have applied it constantly. What we would have to do would be merely to go over the course already pursued, but now with explicit reflection on it. But what is most essential is first of all to have traversed the whole path once, so as, for one thing, to learn to wonder scientifically about the mystery of things and, for another, to banish all illusions, which settle down and nest with particular stubbornness precisely in philosophy.There is no such thing as *the one* phenomenology, and if there could be such a thing it would never become anything like a philosophical technique. For implicit in the essential nature of all genuine method as a path toward the disclosure of objects is the tendency to order itself always toward that which it itself discloses. When a method is genuine and provides access to the objects, it is precisely then that the progress made by following it and the growing originality of the disclosure will cause the very method that was used to become necessarily obsolete. The only thing that is truly new in science and in philosophy is the genuine questioning and struggle with things which is at the service of this questioning.\\" \u2015from_The Basic Problems of Phenomenology_",". Being comes to its destiny in that It, being, givesitself. But thought in terms of such destiny this says: It gives itself andrefuses itself simultaneously. Nonetheless, Hegel\'s definition of history as the development of \\"Spirit\\" is not unuue. Neither is it partly correct andfalse. ~t is as true as metaphysics, which through Hegel first brings tolanguage its essence - thought in terms of the absolute - in the system. Absolute metnphysics, with its Marxian and Nieaschean inversions, belongsto the history of the mth of being. Whatever stems from it cannot becountered or even cast aside by refutations. It can only be taken up in sucha way that its auth is more primordially sheltered in heing itself [r67] andremoved from the domain of mere human opinion. All refutation in thefield of essential thinking is foolish. Smfe among thinkers is the \\"lovers\'quarrel\\" concerning the matter itself. It assists them mutually toward a simple belonging to the Same, from which they find what is fimng for them inthe destiny of being.","Agriculture is now a motorized food industry, the same thing in its essence as the production of corpses in the gas chambers and the extermination camps, the same thing as the blockades and the reduction of countries to famine, the same thing as the manufacture of hydrogen bombs.","The higher compulsion of the earth does not reside primary in the everyday and in deeds, but rather already in the creative force of questioning and in the world-configuring power of a people.","Thus with the question of the Being of truth and the necessity of presupposing it, just as with the question of the essence of knowledge, an \'ideal subject\' has generally been posited. The motive for this, whether explicit or tacit, lies in the requirement that philosophy should have the \'*a priori*\' as its theme, rather than \'empirical facts\' as such. There is some justification for this requirement, though it still needs to be grounded ontologically. Yet is this requirement satisfied by positing an \'ideal subject\'? Is not such a subject *a fanciful idealization*? With such a conception have we not missed precisely the *a priori* character of that merely \'factual\' subject, Dasein? Is it not an attribute of the *a priori* character of the factical subject (that is, an attribute of Dasein\'s facticity) that it is in the truth and in untruth equiprimordially?The ideas of a \'pure \\"I\\"\' and of a \'consciousness in general\' are so far from including the *a priori* character of \'actual\' subjectivity that the ontological characters of Dasein\'s facticity and its state of being are either passed over or not seen at all. Rejection of a \'consciousness in general\' does not signify that the *a priori* is negated, any more than the positing of an idealized subject guarantees that Dasein has an *a priori* character grounded upon fact.Both the contention that there are \'eternal truths\' and the jumbling together of Dasein\'s phenomenally grounded \'ideality\' with an idealized absolute subject, belong to those residues of Christian theology within philosophical problematics which have not as yet been radically extruded.The Being of truth is connected primordially with Dasein. And only because Dasein is as constituted by disclosedness (that is, by understanding), can anything like Being be understood; only so is it possible to understand Being.\\"\u2015from_Being and Time_. Translated by John Macquarrie & Edward Robinson, p. 272","Metaphysics thinks about beings as beings. Wherever the question is asked what beings are, beings as such are in sight. Metaphysical representation owes this sight to the light of Being. The light itself, i.e., that which such thinking experiences as light, does not come within the range of metaphysical thinking; for metaphysics always represents beings only as beings. Within this perspective, metaphysical thinking does, of course, inquire into the being which is the source and originator of this light. But the light itself is considered sufficiently illuminated as soon as we recognize that we look through it whenever we look at beings.In whatever manner beings are interpreted\u2015whether as spirit, after the fashion of spiritualism; or as becoming and life, or idea, will, substance, subject, or *energeia*; or as the eternal recurrence of the same events\u2015every time, beings as beings appear in the light of Being. Wherever metaphysics represents beings, Being has entered into the light. Being has arrived in a state of unconcealedness (aletheia). But whether and how Being itself involves such unconcealedness, whether and how it manifests itself in, and as, metaphysics, remains obscure. Being in its revelatory essence, i.e., in its truth, is not recalled. Nevertheless, when metaphysics gives answers to its question concerning beings as such, metaphysics speaks out of the unnoticed revealedness of Being. The truth of Being may thus be called the ground in which metaphysics, as the root of the tree of philosophy, is kept and from which it is nourished.Because metaphysics inquires about beings as beings, it remains concerned with beings and does not devote itself to Being as Being. As the root of the tree, it sends all nourishment and all strength into the trunk and its branches. The root branches out in the soil to enable the tree to grow out of the ground and thus to leave it. The tree of philosophy grows out of the soil in which metaphysics is rooted. The ground is the element in which the root of the tree lives, but the growth of the tree is never able to absorb this soil in such a way that it disappears in the tree as part of the tree. Instead, the roots, down to the subtlest tendrils, lose themselves in the soil. The ground is ground for the roots, and in the ground the roots forget themselves for the sake of the tree...Metaphysics, insofar as it always represents only beings as beings, does not recall Being itself. Philosophy does not concentrate on its ground. It always leaves its ground\u2015leaves it by means of metaphysics. And yet, it never escapes its ground...Insofar as a thinker sets out to experience the ground of metaphysics, insofar as the attempts to recall the truth of Being itself instead of merely representing beings as beings, his thinking has in a sense left metaphysics. From the point of view of metaphysics, such thinking goes back into the ground of metaphysics.\\"\u2015from_The Way Back to the Ground of Metaphysics_","\xabl\'\u03b1\u03bb\u03ae\u03b8\u03b5\u03b9\u03b1 \xe9s l\'esguardar de l\'\xe9sser endins de l\'obert que ell mateix, i en tant que ell mateix, ha il\xb7luminat, i que \xe9s obert per a l\'il\xb7latent de tot apar\xe8ixer.\xbb","Quanto maior a obra pensada de um pensador - a qual n\xe3o coincide de maneira alguma com a extens\xe3o e o n\xfamero de seus escritos -, tanto maior, nessa obra, aquilo que foi deixado sem pensar, isto \xe9, aquilo que, atrav\xe9s dela e somente dela, chega a n\xf3s como jamais pensado.","Human existence can relate to beings only if it holds itself out into the nothing.

This implies that metaphysics belongs to the \\"nature of man.\\" It is neither a division of academic philosophy nor a field of arbitrary notions. Metaphysics is the basic occurrence of Dasein. It is Dasein itself. Because the truth of metaphysics dwells in this groundless ground it stands in closest proximity to the constantly lurking possibility of deepest error. For this reason no amount of scientific rigor attains to the seriousness of metaphysics. Philosophy can never be measured by the standard of the idea of science.If the question of the nothing unfolded here has actually questioned us, then we have not simply brought metaphysics before us in an extrinsic manner. Nor have we merely been \\"transposed\\" to it. We cannot be transposed there at all, because insofar as we exist we are always there already. \\"For by nature, my friend, man\'s mind dwells in philosophy\\" (Plato, Phaedrus, 279a). So long as man exists, philosophizing of some sort occurs. Philosophy\u2015what we call philosophy\u2015is metaphysics getting under way, in which philosophy comes to itself and to its explicit tasks. Philosophy gets under way only by a peculiar insertion of our own existence into the fundamental possibilities of Dasein as a whole. For this insertion it is of decisive importance, first, that we allow space for beings as a whole; second, that we release ourselves into the nothing, which is to say, that we liberate ourselves from those idols everyone has and to which he is wont to go cringing; and finally, that we let the sweep of our suspense take its full course, so that it swings back into the basic question of metaphysics which the nothing itself compels: \'Why are there beings at all, and why not rather nothing?\\"\u2015from_What is Metaphysics?_","If the power of the intellect in the field of inquiry into the nothing and into Being is thus shattered, then the destiny of the reign of \u2018logic\u2019 in philosophy is thereby decided. The idea of \u2018logic\u2019 itself disintegrates in the turbulence of a more original questioning.","Beauty is a fateful gift of the essence of truth, and here truth means the disclosure of what keeps itself concealed. The beautiful is not what pleases, but what falls within that fateful gift of truth which comes to be when that which is eternally non-apparent and therefore invisible attains its most radiantly apparent appearance.","Being as the event of Appropriation\\": Formerly, philosophythought Being in terms of beings as idea, energeia, actualitas, willand now, one might think, as Appropriation. Understood in thisway, \\"Appropriation\\" means a transformed interpretation of Beingwhich, if it is correct, represents a continuation of metaphysics. Inthis case, the \\"as\\" signifies: Appropriation as a species of Being,subordinated to Being which represents the leading concept that isretained. But if we do what was attempted, and think Being in thesense of the presencing and allowing-to-presence that are there indestiny-which in turn lies in the extending of true time whichopens and conceals-then Being belongs into Appropriating. Giving and its gift receive their determination from Appropriating. Inthat case, Being would be a species of Appropriation, an9 not theother way around.To take refuge in such an inversion would be too cheap. Suchthinking misses the matter at stake. Appropriation is not the encompassing general concept under which Being and time could be subsumed. Logical classifications mean nothing here."]')}}]);
