What a Ride!","We are living in dangerously weird times now. Smart people just shrug and admit they\'re dazed and confused. The only ones left with any confidence at all are the New Dumb. It is the beginning of the end of our world as we knew it. Doom is the operative ethic.","The downward spiral of Dumbness in America is about to hit a new low.","Life has become immeasurably better since I have been forced to stop taking it seriously.","The main problem in any democracy is that crowd-pleasers are generally brainless swine who can go out on a stage & whup their supporters into an orgiastic frenzy - then go back to the office & sell every one of the poor bastards down the tube for a nickel apiece. Probably the rarest form of life in American politics is the man who can turn on a crowd & still keep his head straight - assuming it was straight in the first place.","Insanity is a legal term. Crazy is an art form.","I learned a long time ago that reality was much weirder than anyone\'s imagination.","We are all alone, born alone, die alone, and -- in spite of True Romance magazines -- we shall all someday look back on our lives and see that, in spite of our company, we were alone the whole way. I do not say lonely -- at least, not all the time -- but essentially, and finally, alone. This is what makes your self-respect so important, and I don\'t see how you can respect yourself if you must look in the hearts and minds of others for your happiness.","When the going gets weird, the weird turn pro.","Human beings are the only creatures on earth that claim a God and the only thing that behaves like it hasn\'t got one.","Anybody who thinks that \'it doesn\'t matter who\'s President\' has never been Drafted and sent off to fight and die in a vicious, stupid war on the other side of the world-or been beaten and gassed by Police for trespassing on public property-or been hounded by the IRS for purely political reasons-or locked up in the Cook County Jail with a broken nose and no phone access and twelve perverts wanting to stomp your ass in the shower. That is when it matters who is President or Governor or Police Chief. That is when you will wish you had voted.","Sleep late, have fun, get wild, drink whisky and drive fast on empty streets with nothing in mind but falling in love and not getting arrested.","Hope rises and dreams flicker and die. Love plans for tomorrow and loneliness thinks of yesterday. Life is beautiful and living is pain.","Freedom is something that dies unless it\'s used.","Coming of age in a fascist police state will not be a barrel of fun for anybody, much less for people like me, who are not inclined to suffer Nazis gladly and feel only contempt for the cowardly flag-suckers who would gladly give up their outdated freedom to live for the mess of pottage they have been conned into believing will be freedom from fear.","On some nights, I still believe that a car with the gas needle on empty can run about fifty more miles if you have the right music very loud on the radio.","There\u2019s a lot of things wrong with this country, but one of the few things still right with it is that a man can steer clear of the organized bullshit if he really wants to. It\u2019s a goddamned luxury, and if I were you, I\u2019d take advantage of it while you can.","Never fire a warning shot. It is a waste of ammunition.","Love plans for tomorrow and loneliness thinks of yesterday.","You won\'t find reasonable men on the tops of tall mountains.","As long as I\'m learning something, I figure I\'m OK - it\'s a decent day.","They say that \\"he who flies highest, falls farthest\\" - and who am I to argue? But we can\'t forget that \\"he who doesn\'t flap his wings, never flies at all\\".","So we shall let the reader answer this question for himself: who is the happier man, he who has braved the storm of life and lived or he who has stayed securely on shore and merely existed?","I believe the Republicans have never thought that democracy was anything but a tribal myth.","My greatest talent is in my ability to choose good friends. It\'s about as important as things get.","Anything that gets your blood racing is probably worth doing.","Every man is the sum total of his reactions to experience. As your experiences differ and multiply, you become a different man, and hence your perspective changes. This goes on and on. Every reaction is a learning process; every significant experience alters your perspective.","America... just a nation of two hundred million used car salesmen with all the money we need to buy guns and no qualms about killing anybody else in the world who tries to make us uncomfortable.","A man who procrastinates in his choosing will inevitably have his choice made for him by circumstance.","I drink much less than most people think, and I think much more than most people would believe. I am quite sincere about some of the things which people take very lightly, and almost insultingly unconcerned about some of the things which people take most seriously. In short, I am basically antisocial: certainly not to an alarming degree , but just more so than I appear to be.","Beware of looking for goals: look for a way of life. Decide how you want to live and then see what you can do to make a living WITHIN that way of life.","Maybe there is no Heaven. Or maybe this is all pure gibberish - a product of the demented imagination of a lazy drunken hillbilly with a heart full of hate who has found a way to live out where the real winds blow - to sleep late, have fun, get wild, drink whisky, and drive fast on empty streets with nothing in mind except falling in love and not getting arrested... Res ipsa loquitur. Let the good times roll.","Those who fail to learn from the brutal stompings visited on them in the past are doomed to be brutally stomped in the future.","The slow-rising central horror of \\"Watergate\\" is not that it might grind down to the reluctant impeachment of a vengeful thug of a president whose entire political career has been a monument to the same kind of cheap shots and treachery he finally got nailed for, but that we might somehow fail to learn something from it.","The Edge...There is no honest way to explain it because the only people who really know where it is are the ones who have gone over. The others-the living-are those who pushed their control as far as they felt they could handle it, and then pulled back, or slowed down, or did whatever they had to when it came time to choose between Now and Later. But the edge is still Out there.","In a world as weird and cruel as this one we have made for ourselves, I figure anybody who can find peace and personal happiness without ripping off somebody else deserves to be left alone.","I don\'t see how you can respect yourself if you must look in the hearts and minds of others for your happiness.","I will fight for your right to be weird- just as I know you will fight for mine.","We have become a Nazi monster in the eyes of the whole world \u2014 a nation of bullies and bastards who would rather kill than live peacefully. We are not just Whores for power and oil, but killer whores with hate and fear in our hearts.","Never turn your back on fear. It should always be in front of you, like a thing that might have to be killed.","Music has always been a matter of Energy to me, a question of Fuel. Sentimental people call it Inspiration, but what they really mean is Fuel. I have always needed Fuel. I am a serious consumer. On some nights I still believe that a car with the gas needle on empty can run about fifty more miles if you have the right music very loud on the radio.","Yesterday\'s weirdness is tomorrow\'s reason why.","Beware of looking for goals: look for a way of life.","I miss Nixon. Compared to these Nazis we have in the White House now, Richard Nixon was a flaming liberal.","Call on God, but row away from the rocks.","The pleasure is in the path, the search for something good.","As your attorney, it is my duty to inform you that it is not important that you understand what I\'m doing or why you\'re paying me so much money. What\'s important is that you continue to do so.","I hate to advocate drugs, alcohol, violence, or insanity to anyone, but they\'ve always worked for me.","It is not necessary to accept the choices handed down to you by life as you know it.","Words are such a poor medium when you really want someone to feel something.","It\'s in my interest, in ours perhaps, or maybe the interests of the greater good, for me to smoke a joint, and calm down.","The mind of America is seized by a fatal dry rot - and it\'s only a question of time before all that the mind controls will run amuck in a frenzy of stupid, impotent fear.","There is no story unless you\'ve written it.","Walk tall, kick ass, learn to speak Arabic, love music and never forget you come from a long line of truth seekers, lovers and warriors.","Liberalism itself has failed, and for a pretty good reason. It has been too often compromised by the people who represented it.","In a closed society where everybody\'s guilty, the only crime is getting caught. In a world of thieves, the only final sin is stupidity.","And in fact the only way I can deal with this eerie situation at all is to make a conscious decision that I have already lived and finished the life I planned to live - and everything from now on will be A New Life, a different thing, a gig that ends tonight and starts tomorrow morning.","Every GOP administration since 1952 has let the Military-Industrial Complex loot the Treasury and plunge the nation into debt on the excuse of a wartime economic emergency.","Some may never live, but the crazy never die.","Good news is rare these days, and every glittering ounce of it should be cherished and hoarded and worshipped and fondled like a priceless diamond.","Freedom, Truth, Honour \x97 you could rattle off a hundred such words and behind every one of them would gather a thousand punks, pompous little farts, waving the banner with one hand and reaching under the table with the other.","The only difference between the sane and the insane is that the sane have the power to lock up the insane.","We are turning into a nation of whimpering slaves to Fear\u2014fear of war, fear of poverty, fear of random terrorism, fear of getting down-sized or fired because of the plunging economy, fear of getting evicted for bad debts or suddenly getting locked up in a military detention camp on vague charges of being a Terrorist sympathizer.","I damn well intend to keep on living the way I think I should.","Buy the ticket, take the ride.","There are always risks in challenging excessive police power, but the risks of not challenging it are more dangerous, even fatal.","In Hong Kong, Dallas, or at home \u2014and regardless of whether or not I have been to bed \u2014 breakfast is a personal ritual that can only be properly observed alone, and in a spirit of genuine excess. The food factor should always be massive: four Bloody Marys, two grapefruits, a pot of coffee, Rangoon crepes, a half pound of either sausage, bacon, or corned beef hash with diced chilies , a Spanish omelette or eggs Benedict, a quart of milk, a chopped lemon for random seasoning, and something like a slice of Key lime pie, two margaritas, and six lines of the best cocaine for dessert.","There is an ancient Celtic axiom that says \'Good people drink good beer.\' Which is true, then as now. Just look around you in any public barroom and you will quickly see: Bad people drink bad beer. Think about it.","On some days you get what you want, and on others, you get what you need.","With the truth so dull and depressing, the only working alternative is wild bursts of madness and filigree.","If you\'re going to be crazy, you have to get paid for it or else you\'re going to be locked up.","A sense of humor is the main measure of sanity.","All political power comes from the barrel of either guns, pussy, or opium pipes, and people seem to like it that way.","As far as I\'m concerned, it\'s a damned shame that a field as potentially dynamic and vital as journalism should be overrun with dullards, bums, and hacks, hag-ridden with myopia, apathy, and complacence, and generally stuck in a bog of stagnant mediocrity.","I just usually go with my own taste. If I like something, and it happens to be against the law, well, then I might have a problem.","In a world of thieves, the only final sin is stupidity.","I have never felt comfortable around people who talk about their feelings for Jesus, or any other deity for that matter, because they are usually none too bright... Or maybe \\"stupid\\" is a better way of saying it; but I have never seen much point in getting heavy with either stupid people or Jesus freaks, just as long as they don\'t bother me. In a world as weird and cruel as this one we have made for ourselves, I figure anybody who can find peace and personal happiness without ripping off somebody else deserves to be left alone. They will not inherit the earth, but then neither will I.","I have a theory that the truth is never told during the nine-to-five hours.","We cannot expect people to have respect for law and order until we teach respect to those we have entrusted to enforce those laws.","Graffiti is beautiful; like a brick in the face of a cop.","Fear is a healthy instinct, not a sign of weakness. It is a natural self-defense mechanism that is common to felines, wolves, hyenas, and most humans. Even fruit bats know fear, and I salute them for it. If you think the world is weird now, imagine how weird it would be if wild beasts had no fear.","He had that rare weird electricity about him - that extremely wild and heavy presence that you only see in a person who has abandoned all hope of ever behaving normally.","It was one of those fine little love stories that can make you smile in your sleep at night.","The real power in America is held by a fast-emerging new Oligarchy of pimps and preachers who see no need for Democracy or fairness or even trees, except maybe the ones in their own yards, and they don\'t mind admitting it.","Let us toast to animal pleasures, to escapism, to rain on the roof and instant coffee, to unemployment insurance and library cards, to absinthe and good-hearted landlords, to music and warm bodies and contraceptives... and to the \\"good life\\", whatever it is and wherever it happens to be.","There is no such thing as paranoia. Your worst fears can come true at any moment.","It was like falling down an elevator shaft and landing in a pool full of mermaids.","For every moment of triumph, for every instance of beauty, many souls must be trampled.","Rush Limbaugh is a lame professional swine, and he makes a good living at it. He is like a hired geek in some traveling backwoods carnival - the freaks who bite the heads off chickens - but Limbaugh is a modernized geek who thinks he can bite the heads off of people.","A cap of good acid costs $5, and for that you can hear the Universal Symphony, with God singing solo and the Holy Ghost on drums.","God\'s mercy on you degenerate swine.","I have always loved marijuana. It has been a source of joy and comfort to me for many years. And I still think of it as a basic staple of life, along with beer and ice and grapefruits - and millions of Americans agree with me.","Maybe it meant something. Maybe not, in the long run, but no explanation, no mix of words or music or memories can touch that sense of knowing that you were there and alive in that corner of time and the world. Whatever it meant.","If there is in fact, a heaven and a hell, all we know for sure is that hell will be a viciously overcrowded version of Phoenix.","All the blood is drained out of democracy - it dies - when only half the population votes.","\'Crazy\' is a term of art; \'Insane\' is a term of law. Remember that, and you will save yourself a lot of trouble.","Most of my friends are into strange things I don\'t really understand - and with a few shameful exceptions I wish them all well. Who am I, after all, to tell some friend he shouldn\'t change his name to Oliver High, get rid of his family, and join a Satanism cult in Seattle? Or to argue with another friend who wants to buy a single-shot Remington Fireball so he can go out and shoot cops from a safe distance?","For a loser, Vegas is the meanest town on earth.","No sympathy for the devil; keep that in mind. Buy the ticket, take the ride...and if it occasionally gets a little heavier than what you had in mind, well...maybe chalk it off to forced conscious expansion: Tune in, freak out, get beaten.","It was obvious that he was a man who marched through life to the rhythms of some drum I would never hear.","As you were, I was. As I am, you will be.","I\u2019m a word freak. I like words. I\u2019ve always compared writing to music. That\u2019s the way I feel about good paragraphs. When it really works, it\u2019s like music.","Sex without love is as hollow and ridiculous as love without sex.","We had two bags of grass, seventy-five pellets of mescaline, five sheets of high powered blotter acid, a salt shaker half full of cocaine, and a whole galaxy of multi-colored uppers, downers, screamers, laughers... and also a quart of tequila, a quart of rum, a case of Budweiser, a pint of raw ether and two dozen amyls. Not that we needed all that for the trip, but once you get locked into a serious drug collection, the tendency is to push it as far as you can.","At the top of the mountain we are all snow leopards.","Fiction is a bridge to the truth that journalism can\'t reach.","The most important thing a writer can have [is] the ability to live with the constant loneliness and a strong sense of revulsion for the banalities of everyday socializing.","Today\'s pig is tomorrows bacon!","There\'s a terrible danger in voting for the lesser of two evils because the parties can set it up that way.","I was never trying, necessarily, to be an outlaw. It was just the place in which I found myself.","Some people will tell you that slow is good - but I\'m here to tell you that fast is better. I\'ve always believed this, in spite of the trouble it\'s caused me. Being shot out of a cannon will always be better than being squeezed out of a tube. That is why God made fast motorcycles, Bubba.","An outlaw can be defined as somebody who lives outside the law, beyond the law and not necessarily against it.","I am a generous man, by nature, and far more trusting than I should be. Indeed. The real world is risky territory for people with generosity of spirit. Beware.","Did you see Bush on TV, trying to debate? Jesus, he talked like a donkey with no brains at all...It was pitiful...I almost felt sorry for him, until I heard someone call him \'Mr. President,\' and then I felt ashamed.","A man who has blown all his options can\'t afford the luxury of changing his ways. He has to capitalize on whatever he has left, and he can\'t afford to admit - no matter how often he\'s reminded of it - that every day of his life takes him farther and farther down a blind alley.","I think I\'m one of the most patriotic people that I\'ve ever encountered in America. I consider myself a bedrock patriot. I participate very actively in local politics, because my voice might be worthwhile. I participate in a meaningful way - not by donations; I work at it.","It will be a Religious War, a sort of Christian Jihad, fueled by religious hatred and led by merciless fanatics on both sides. It will be guerilla warfare on a global scale, with no front lines and no identifiable enemy.","Richard Nixon has never been one of my favorite people anyway. For years I\'ve regarded his existence as a monument to all the rancid genes and broken chromosomes that corrupt the possibilities of the American Dream; he was a foul caricature of himself, a man with no soul, no inner convictions, with the integrity of a hyena and the style of a poison toad. The Nixon I remembered was absolutely humorless; I couldn\'t imagine him laughing at anything except maybe a paraplegic who wanted to vote Democratic but couldn\'t quite reach the lever on the voting machine.","I am surprised and embarrassed to be a part of the first American generation to leave the country in far worse shape than it was when we first came into it.","Don\'t judge your taco by its price","There was an awful suspicion in my mind that I\'d finally gone over the hump, and the worst thing about it was that I didn\'t feel tragic at all, but only weary, and sort of comfortably detached.","That is the problem with this rich and anguished generation. Somewhere a long time ago they fell in love with the idea that politicians- even the slickest and brightest presidential candidates- were real heroes and truly exciting people. That is wrong on its face. They are mainly dull people with corrupt instincts and criminal children.","I have no taste for either poverty or honest labor, so writing is the only recourse left for me","Anything worth doing is worth doing well.","There is something fresh and crisp about the first hours of a Caribbean day, a happy anticipation that something is about to happen, maybe just up the street or around the next corner.","Avoid being seized by the police. The cops are not your friends. Don\'t tell them anything.","I have warned many times about the guaranteed dangers of betting with your heart instead of your head - big darkness, soon come - but every once in a while you get a fair chance to have it both ways, and the annual NCAA basketball Tournament is one of them.","I need beaches, and blackness, and moonlit nakedness.","1) Never trust a cop in a raincoat. 2) Beware of enthusiasm and of love, both are temporary and quick to sway. 3) If asked if you care about the world\'s problems, look deep into the eyes of he who asks, he will never ask you again. 4) Never give your real name. 5) If ever asked to look at yourself, don\'t look. 6) Never do anything the person standing in front of you can\'t understand. 7) Never create anything, it will be misinterpreted, it will chain you and follow you for the rest of your life.","I understand that fear is my friend, but not always. Never turn your back on Fear. It should always be in front of you, like a thing that might have to be killed. My father taught me that, along with a few other things that have kept my life interesting.","I never knew where I was going, but I ripped the tits off of everything that got in my way. By the time they figured me out, it was too late.","I felt a tremendous distance between myself and everything real.","All my life, my heart has sought a thing I cannot name. Remembered line from a long- forgotten poem","One of the most basic factors in sports is that winning becomes a habit, and losing is the same way. When failure starts to feel normal in your life or your work or even your darkest vices, you won\'t have to go looking for trouble, because trouble will find you. Count on it.","Writing is the flip side of sex - it\'s good only when it\'s over.","Wake up and ponder the future","My first feeling was a wild desire to drive a stake in the sand and claim the place for myself. The beach was white as salt, and cut off from the world by a ring of steep hills that faced the sea. We were on the edge of a large bay and the water was that clear, turquoise color that you get with a white sand bottom. I had never seen such a place. I wanted to take off all my clothes and never wear them again.","A word to the wise is infuriating.","Happy,\\" I muttered, trying to pin the word down. But it is one of those words, like Love, that I have never quite understood. Most people who deal in words don\u2019t have much faith in them and I am no exception \u2013 especially the big ones like Happy and Love and Honest and Strong. They are too elusive and far to relative when you compare them to sharp, mean little words like Punk and Cheap and Phony. I feel at home with these, because they\u2019re scrawny and easy to pin, but the big ones are tough and it takes either a priest or a fool to use them with any confidence.","All we have to do is get out and vote, while it\'s still legal, and we will wash those crooked warmongers out of the White House.","[Chicago]: This vicious, stinking zoo, this mean-grinning, mace-smelling boneyard of a city: an elegant rockpile of a monument to everything cruel and stupid and corrupt in the human spirit.","Anybody who thinks that \'it doesn\'t matter who\'s President\' has never been Drafted and sent off to fight and die in a vicious, stupid war on the other side of the world","I don\'t mean to say that I\'m about to state my credo here on this page, but merely to affirm, sincerely for the first time in my life, my belief in man as an individual and independent entity. Certainly not independence in the everyday sense of the word, but pertaining to a freedom and mobility of thought that few people are able - or even have the courage - to achieve.","Nixon was a professional politician, and I despised everything he stood for -- but if he were running for president this year against the evil Bush-Cheney gang, I would happily vote for him.","Not a wasted word. This has been a main point to my literary thinking all my life.","When you write for a living and you can\'t do anything else, you know that sooner or later that the deadline is going to come screaming down on you like a goddamn banshee. There\'s no avoiding it...So one day you just don\'t appear at the El Adobe bar anymore; you shut the door, paint the windows black, rent an electric typewriter and become the monster you always were - the writer.","No man is so foolish but he may sometimes give another good counsel, and no man so wise that he may not easily err if he takes no other counsel than his own. He that is taught only by himself has a fool for a master.","These things happen. One day you run everything, and the next day you run like a dog.","It\'s a strange world. Some people get rich and others eat sh** and die.","I knew a Buddhist once, and I\'ve hated myself ever since.","Good mescaline comes on slow. The first hour is all waiting, then about halfway through the second hour you start cursing the creep who burned you, because nothing is happening...and then ZANG!","Ah, lives there a man with soul so dead, who never to himself hath said As he hunched and rolled in his comfortable bed: To hell with the rent . . . I\'ll drink instead!","The Edge... there is no honest way to explain it because the only people who really know where it is are the ones who have gone over.","It gave me a strange feeling, and the rest of that night I didn\u2019t say much, but merely sat there and drank, trying to decide if I was getting older and wiser, or just plain old.","We can\'t stop here, this is bat country!","Goddammit. Yeah, I have. First, there\'s a huge difference between being arrested and being guilty. Second, see, the law changes and I don\'t. How I stand vis-\xe0-vis the law at any given moment depends on the law. The law can change from state to state, from nation to nation, from city to city. I guess I have to go by a higher law. How\'s that? Yeah, I consider myself a road man for the lords of karma.","If you work in either journalism or politics... you will be flogged for being right and flogged for being wrong, and it hurts both ways-but it doesn\'t hurt as much when you\'re right.","I would feel real trapped in this life if I didn\'t know I could commit suicide at any time.","Everyone crashes Some get back on Some don\'t Some can\'t.","To make a point of declaring friendship is to cheapen it. For men\'s emotions are very rarely put into words successfully.","We were somewhere around Barstow on the edge of the desert when the drugs began to take hold. I remember saying something like \\"I feel a bit lightheaded; maybe you should drive....\\" And suddenly there was a terrible roar all around us and the sky was full of what looked like huge bats, all swooping and screeching and diving around the car, which was going about a hundred miles an hour with the top down to Las Vegas.","Because the writer must be a participant in the scene, while he\'s writing it \u2014 or at least taping it, or even sketching it. Or all three. Probably the closest analogy to the ideal would be a film director/producer who writes his own scripts, does his own camera work and somehow manages to film himself in action, as the protagonist or at least a main character.","The towers are gone now, reduced to bloody rubble, along with all hopes for Peace in Our Time, in the United States or any other country. Make no mistake about it: We are At War now & with somebody & and we will stay At War with that mysterious Enemy for the rest of our lives.","The TV business is uglier than most things. It is normally perceived as some kind of cruel and shallow money trench through the heart of the journalism industry, a long plastic hallway where thieves and pimps run free and good men die like dogs, for no good reason.","I have always loved blizzards, if only because of the driving experience - which is definitely an acquired taste.","And that, I think, was the handle--that sense of inevitable victory over the forces of Old and Evil. Not in any mean or military sense; we didn\'t need that. Our energy would simply prevail. There was no point in fighting--on our side or theirs. We had all the momentum; we were riding the crest of a high and beautiful wave. So now, less than five years later, you can go up on a steep hill in Las Vegas and look West, and with the right kind of eyes you can almost see the high-water mark--the place where the wave finally broke and rolled back.","Fear is just another word for ignorance.","I feel the same way about disco as I do about herpes.","It never got weird enough for me.","If you get people asking the wrong questions, you don\'t have to worry about the answers.","In the meantime, I would drink, rest, and ponder the meaning of this mob.","Absolute truth is a very rare and dangerous commodity in the context of professional journalism.","We are turning into a nation of whimpering slaves to Fear","Being shot out of a cannon will always be better than being squeezed out of a tube. That is why God made fast motorcycles, Bubba.","If Sunday is the Lord\'s day, then Saturday belongs to the Devil. It is the only night of the week when he gives out Free passes to the Late show at the Too Much Fun Club.","You can\'t hoard fun. It has no shelf life.","The Raiders of old were vicious and crazy and cruel. Hanging around their locker room was like hanging around the weight room at Folsom Prison.","Faster, Faster, until the thrill of speed overcomes the fear of death.","I hate pain, despite my ability to tolerate it beyond all known parameters, which is not necessarily a good thing.","Objective journalism is one of the main reasons that American politics has been allowed to be so corrupt for so long.","Sane is rich and powerful. Insane is wrong and poor and weak. The rich are free, the poor are put in cages. Res Ipsa Loquitur, amen. Mahalo.","Morality is temporary, wisdom is permanent.","Houston is a cruel, crazy town on a filthy river in East Texas with no zoning laws and a culture of sex, money and violence. It\'s a shabby, sprawling metropolis ruled by brazen women, crooked cops and super-rich pansexual cowboys who live by the code of the West -- which can mean just about anything you need it to mean, in a pinch.","Weird heroes and mould-breaking champions exist as living proof to those who need it that the tyranny of \'the rat race\' is not yet final.","No one HAS to do something he doesn\u2019t want to do for the rest of his life. But then again, if that\u2019s what you wind up doing, by all means convince yourself that you HAD to do it. You\u2019ll have lots of company.","Truth is weirder than any fiction I\'ve seen.","The first impression is always the right one. I rarely change my mind upward about people.","Ah, that we lack the courage of our romantic convictions; and thereby miss the wine of life, forgoing the very thing that makes living worthwhile.","Every reaction is a learning process; every significant experience alters your perspective. So it would seem foolish, would it not, to adjust our lives to the demands of a goal we see from a different angle everyday? How could we ever hope to accomplish anything anther than galloping neurosis?","And the whole Bush family, from Texas, should be boiled in poisoned oil.","Revenge is one of the few things in politics that never gets lost in the mail or written off for a dime on the dollar like losers\' campaign debts or pledges to help the Poor.","I am a road man for the lords of karma.","You\'d be surprised at the things people will do in order to get their names or pictures in the paper.","The most consistent and ultimately damaging failure of political journalism in America (is that it) has its roots in the clubby/cocktail personal relationships that inevitably develop between politicians and journalists.","No, this is not a good town for psychedelic drugs. Reality itself is too twisted.","I find that by putting things in writing I can understand them and see them a little more objectively. ... For words are merely tools and if you use the right ones you can actually put even your life in order, if you don\'t lie to yourself and use the wrong words.","You can\u2019t play city rules when you live in a jungle.","There is no fool like a careless gambler who starts taking victory for granted.","I wanted to take off all my clothes and never wear them again.","I have never believed much in luck, and my sense of humor has tended to walk on the dark side.","If you can\'t make yourself understood by your friends, you\'ll be in trouble when your enemies come for you.","The car suddenly veered off the road and we came to a sliding halt in the gravel. I was hurled against the dashboard. My attorney was slumped over the wheel. \u201cWhat\u2019s wrong?\u201d I yelled. \u201cWe can\u2019t stop here. This is bat country!","I didn\'t know Johnny Depp could act until he played me.","The mind & body must be subjected to extreme stimulus, by means of drugs & music.","Good people drink good beer.","Who said anything about slicing you up? ... I just wanted to carve a little Z on your forehead-- nothing serious.","George McGovern, for all his mistakes... understands what a fantastic monument to all the best instincts of the human race this country might have been, if we could have kept it out of the hands of greedy little hustlers like Richard Nixon.","Have an objective to give your bender a theme. For instance, stalking and killing a wild pig with a bowie knife.","In a nation ruled by swine, all pigs are upward mobile.","Timothy Leary and I kept the same hours. He believed, as I do, that \u201cAfter midnight, all things are possible.","Women are terrified of being raped, but somewhere in the back of the womb there is one rebellious nerve end that tingles with curiosity whenever the word is mentioned.","The brutal reality of politics would be probably intolerable without drugs.","The possibility of physical and mental collapse is very real now... but collapse is out of the question; as a solution or even a cheap alternative, it is unacceptable. No sympathy for the devil; keep that in mind.","we left about midnight and walked down the hill in silence. the night was muggy, and all around me i felt the same pressure, a sense of time rushing by while it seemed to be standing still. whenever i thought of time in puerto rico, i was reminded of those old magnetic clocks that hung on the walls of my classrooms in high school. every now and then a hand would not move for several minutes -- and if i watched it long enough, wondering if it had finally broken down, the sudden click of the hand jumping three for four notches would startle me when it came.","[Richard M. Nixon was] a foul caricature of himself, a man with no soul, no inner convictions, with the integrity of a hyena and the style of a poison toad.","All advice can only be a product of the man who gives it.","Some people will tell you that slow is good - but I\'m here to tell you that fast is better.","We are all wired into a survival trip, now.","Paranoia is just another mask for ignorance. The truth, when you finally chase it down is almost always far worse than your darkest visions and fears","Turn the goddam music up! My heart feels like an alligator!","Jesus! Did I SAY that? Or just think it? Was I talking? Did they hear me? I glanced over at my attorney, but he seemed oblivious.","You better take care of me Lord, if you don\'t you\'re gonna have me on your hands.","Ignore that nightmare in the bathroom. Just another ugly refugee from the Love Generation, some doom-struck gimp who couldn\'t handle the pressure. My attorney has never been able to accept the notion - often espoused by reformed drug abusers and especially popular among those on probation - that you can get a lot higher without drugs than with them. And neither have I, for that matter.","I shared a vagrant optimism that some of us were making real progress, that we had taken an honest road, and that the best of us would inevitably make it over the top. At the same time, I felt that the life we were leading was a lost cause, that we were all actor, kidding ourselves on a senseless odyssey. It was the tension between those two poles - a restless idealism on one hand and a sense of impending doom on the other - that kept me going.","Like most of the others, I was a seeker, a mover, a malcontent, and at times a stupid hell-raiser.","All golfers fear the one-iron. It has no angle, no loft. The one-iron is a confidence-crusher, a fear trip, an almost guarantee of shame, failure, dumbness and humiliation if you ever use it in public.","Myths and legends die hard in America. We love them for the extra dimension they provide, the illusion of near-infinite possibility to erase the narrow confines of most men\'s reality. Weird heroes and mould-breaking champions exist as living proof to those who need it that the tyranny of \'the rat race\' is not yet final.","One of the advantages of being dead, I guess, is that somebody else can edit all this.","I was not proud of what I had learned but I never doubted that it was worth knowing.","It was wonderful, a stunning happy ending to what began as another tragic rock & roll story, as if Bob Dylan had been arrested in Miami for jacking off in a seedy little XXX theater while stroking the spine of a fat young boy.","There is nothing in the world more helpless and irresponsible and depraved than a man in the depths of an ether binge. It makes you behave like the village drunkard in some early Irish novel. Total loss of all basic motor skills, blurred vision, no balance, numb tongue - the mind recoils in horror, unable to communicate with the spinal column. Which is interesting, because you can actually watch yourself behaving in this terrible way, but you can\u2019t control it.","I\'m a relatively respectable citizen. Multiple felon perhaps, but certainly not dangerous.","We were somewhere around Barstow, on the edge of the desert, when the drugs began to take hold.","Get out of control, but appear under control. It?s not bad to alarm other people, though ? it?s good for them.","Justice is expensive in America. There are no Free Passes... You might want to remember this, the next time you get careless and blow off a few Parking Tickets. They will come back to haunt you the next time you see a Cop car in your rear-view mirror.","The importance of Liking Yourself is a notion that fell heavily out of favor during the coptic, anti-ego frenzy of the Acid Era--but nobody guessed back then that the experiment might churn up this kind of hangover: a whole subculture of frightened illiterates with no faith in anything.","A man has to BE something; he has to matter.","There is not much mental distance between a feeling of having been screwed and the ethic of total retaliation, or at least the kind of random revenge that comes with outraging the public decency.","Things are no longer what they seem to be. My telephones are haunted, and animals whisper at me from unseen places.","It is like sitting in a traffic jam on the San Diego Freeway with your windows rolled up and Portuguese music booming out of the surround-sound speakers while animals gnaw on your neck and diseased bill collectors hammer on your doors with golf clubs.","Gonzo journalism is a style of reporting based on William Faulkner\'s idea that the best fiction is far more true than any kind of journalism.","There is nothing Modern about doing dumb things for dumb reasons.","The Jews don\'t beleive in Jesus! Why should I?! WHOOOEEEE!!","I haven\'t found a drug yet that can get you anywhere near as high as a sitting at a desk writing, trying to imagine a story no matter how bizarre it is, [or] going out and getting into the weirdness of reality and doing a little time on the Proud Highway.","In some circles, the Mint 400 is a far, far better thing than the Superbowl, the Kentucky Derby, and the lower Oakland roller derby finals all rolled into one. This race attracts a very special breed.","This is the way life goes in Big Sur. Waiting for the mail, watching the sea-lions in the surf or the freighters on the horizon, sitting in the tubs at Hot Springs, once in a while a bit of drink - and, most of the time, working at what ever it is that you came here to work on, whether it be painting, writing, gardening or the simple art of living your own life.","As things stand now, I am going to be a writer. I\'m not sure that I\'m going to be a good one or even a self-supporting one, but until the dark thumb of fate presses me to the dust and says \'you are nothing\', I will be a writer.","I have long understood that losing always comes with the territory when you wander into the gambling business, just as getting crippled for life is an acceptable risk in the linebacker business. They both are extremely violent sports, and pain is part of the bargain. Buy the ticket, take the ride.","When you push a car off a cliff and blow it up, be sure to roll the windows down to avoid shrapnel. Also, strip the license plate so you\'re not billed for the cleanup.","What passed for society was a loud, giddy whirl of thieves and pretentious hustlers, a dull sideshow full of quacks and clowns and philistines with gimp mentalities.","Luck is a very thin wire between survival and disaster, and not many people can keep their balance on it.","North Vegas is where you go if you\'re a hooker turning forty and the syndicate men on the strip decide you\'re no longer much good for business out there with the high rollers.","\\"Drugs\\" are not necessarily narcotics. The narcotic is one type of drug and coffee is a drug... booze is a drug... many drugs.... They\'re all around us.","Once I establish credit, I may be able to function. A man needs credit. Especially when he has no money.","As I see it then, the formula runs something like this: a man must choose a path which will let his ABILITIES function at maximum efficiency toward the gratification of his DESIRES.","Just the other day the AP wire had a story about a man from Arkansas who entered some kind of contest and won a two-week vacation--all expenses paid--wherever he wanted to go. Any place in the world: Mongolia, Easter Island, the Turkish Riviera . . . but his choice was Salt Lake City, and that\'s where he went. Is this man a registered voter? Has he come to grips with the issues? Has he bathed in the blood of the lamb?","Sex, drugs, and insanity have always worked for me, but I wouldn\'t recommend them for everyone.","The only thing that really worried me was the ether. There is nothing in the world more helpless and irresponsible and depraved than a man in the depths of an ether binge. And I knew we\'d get into that rotten stuff pretty soon. Probably at the next gas station.","No matter how much I wanted all those things that I needed money to buy, there was some devilish current pushing me off in another direction -- toward anarchy and poverty and craziness. That maddening delusion that a man can lead a decent life without hiring himself out as a Judas Goat.","We must ride this strange torpedo out until the end.","The world is still a weird place, despite my efforts to make clear and perfect sense of it.","A man can live on his wits and his balls for only so long.","Smart people understand that there is no such thing as paranoia. It is just another mask for ignorance.","He could shake your hand and stab you in the back at the same time.","We are all alone, born alone, die alone, and - in spite of True Romance magazines - we shall all someday look back on our lives and see that, in spite of our company, we were alone the whole way.","The massive, frustrated energies of a mainly young, disillusioned electorate that has long since abandoned the idea that we all have a duty to vote. This is like being told you have a duty to buy a new car, but you have to choose immediately between a Ford and a Chevy.","On my tombstone they will carve, \\"IT NEVER GOT FAST ENOUGH FOR ME.","To give advice to a man who asks what to do with his life implies something very close to egomania. To presume to point a man to the right and ultimate goal - to point with a trembling finger in the RIGHT direction is something only a fool would take upon himself.","One of the few ways I can almost be certain I\'ll understand something is by sitting down and writing about it. Because by forcing yourself to write about it and putting it down in words, you can\'t avoid having your say on the subject. You might be wrong, but you have to think about it very intensely to write about it.","Jack Kerouac influenced me quite a bit as a writer... in the Arab sense that the enemy of my enemy was my friend.","Few people understand the psychology of dealing with a highway traffic cop.","I noticed at once that Depp had a dangerously energized intelligence . . . He was a suave little brute, but he had a wicked sense of humor and a rare instinct for escalation.","With the possible exception of things like box scores, race results, and stock market tabulations, there is no such thing as Objective Journalism. The phrase itself is a pompous contradiction in terms.","The highways are crowded with people who drive as if their sole purpose in getting behind the wheel is to avenge every wrong done them by man, beast or fate. The only thing that keeps them in line is their fear of death, jail and lawsuits.","We have bigger things to brood on and enormous reasons for wallowing in terminal craziness until we finally hit bottom.","It drops us into a vigorous current, a constant state of misguided control. The doomed generation takes a final step forward, ignoring all the signs that state the obvious, and leaps into a trip no drug known to man could ever encompass.","A little bit of this town goes a very long way.","This is the fast lane, folks...and some of us like it here.","I am not a yachting person, by nature, but I have just enough experience on the sea under sail to feel a certain nostalgia for it when I see a big white racing yacht heeled over at cruising speed on the ocean, and I can still tie a mean bowline knot on just about anything in less than 10 seconds.","In a nation ruled by swine, all pigs are upward mobile - and the rest of us are fucked until we can put our acts together: Not necessarily to Win, but mainly to keep from Losing Completely.","Though I was careful never to mention it, I began to see a new dimension in everything that happened.","The streets of every city in America are filled with men who would pay all the money they could lay their hands on to be transformed, even for a day, into hairy, hard-fisted brutes who walk all over cops, extort drinks from terrified bartenders and roar out of town on big motorcycles after raping the banker\'s daughter.","There is always room for losers in the football business. They are the mother\'s milk of gambling, and why not? Somebody has to do it, or there won\'t be any winners.","It was the Law of the Sea, they said. Civilization ends at the waterline. Beyond that, we all enter the food chain, and not always right at the top.","Life is beautiful and living is pain.","I\'ve always considered writing the most hateful kind of work. I suspect it\'s a bit like fucking - which is fun only for amateurs. Old whores don\'t do much giggling.","Familiarity seems to breed contempt","There was madness in any direction, at any hour. You could strike sparks anywhere. There was a fantastic universal sense that whatever we were doing was right, that we were winning.","At age 22 I set what I insist is an all-time record for distance hitchhiking in Bermuda shorts: 3,700 miles in three weeks.","The greatest mania of all is passion: and I am a natural slave to passion: the balance between my brain and my soul and my body is as wild and delicate as the skin of a Ming vase.","Politics is the art of controlling your environment.","There is nothing in the world more helpless and irresponsible and depraved than a man in the depths of an ether binge.","If we get chased out of Iraq with our tail between our legs, that will be the fifth consecutive Third-world country with no hint of a Navy or an Air Force to have whipped us in the past 40 years.","All gamblers lose regularly, but they rarely discuss it in public. Losing is bad for the image, dude. Nobody buys Hot Tips from Losers. Remember that.","That was always the difference between Muhammad Ali and the rest of us. He came, he saw, and if he didn\'t entirely conquer - he came as close as anybody we are likely to see in the lifetime of this doomed generation.","One of them is knowing the difference between Morality and Wisdom. Morality is temporary, Wisdom is permanent\u2026 Ho ho. Take that one to bed with you tonight.","It\'s hard to say what I meant by \\"as we know it.\\" I\'m not about to go up on a mountain on new year\'s eve and wait for the lightening to strike.","Football fans share a universal language that cuts across many cultures and many personality types. A serious football fan is never alone. We are legion, and football is often the only thing we have in common.","Democracy as a system has evolved into something that Thomas Jefferson didn\'t anticipate.","He had come so far from himself that I don\'t think he knew who he was anymore.","Nixon represents that dark, venal and incurably violent side of the American character almost every other country in the world has learned to fear and despise.","I went to the Democratic Convention as a journalist, and returned a cold-blooded revolutionary.","If I\'d written all the truth I knew for the past ten years, about 600 people - including me - would be rotting in prison cells from Rio to Seattle today. Absolute truth is a very rare and dangerous commodity in the context of professional journalism.","Platitudes are safe, because they\'re easy to wink at, but truth is something else again.","There is nothing worse than a man in the throws of an ether bender.","The regrets I have are so minor. You know, would I leave my Keith Richards hat, with the silver skull on it, on the stool at the coffee shop at LaGuardia? I wouldn\'t do that again. But overall, no, I don\'t have any regrets.","My life has been the polar opposite of safe, but I am proud of it and so is my son, and that is good enough for me. I would do it all over again without changing the beat, although I have never recommended it to others. That would be cruel and irresponsible and wrong, I think, and I am none of those things.","Reality itself is too twisted.","No More Games. No More Bombs. No More Walking. No More Fun. No More Swimming. 67. That is 17 years past 50. 17 more than I needed or wanted. Boring. I am always bitchy. No Fun \u2014 for anybody. 67. You are getting Greedy. Act your old age. Relax \u2014 This won\'t hurt","Going to trial with a lawyer who considers your whole life-style a Crime in Progress is not a happy prospect.","I felt like a monster reincarnation of Horatio Alger: A man on the move, and just sick enough to be totally confident.","By any accepted standard, I have had more than nine lives. I counted them up once, and there were 13 times I almost and maybe should have died.","How long can we maintain? I wonder. How long before one of us starts raving and jabbering at this boy? What will he think then? This same lonely desert was the last known home of the Manson family. Will he make that grim connection.","Old God sure was in a good mood when he made this place.","We came out here to find the American Dream, and now that we\'re right in the vortex you want to quit ... You must realize that we\'ve found the main nerve.\\" I know,\\" he said. \\"That\'s what gives me the Fear.","The room was very quiet. I walked over to the TV set and turned it on to a dead channel-white noise at maximum decibels, a fine sound for sleeping, a powerful continuous hiss to drown out everything strange.","Relax - This won\'t hurt.","There\'s also a down side.","The whole framework of the presidency is getting out of hand. It\'s come to the point where you almost can\'t run unless you can cause people to salivate and whip each other with big sticks. You almost have to be a rock star to get the kind of fever you need to survive in American politics.","Not everybody is comfortable with the idea that politics is a guilty addiction. But it is.","Why are we seeing George Bush on TV every two hours for nine or ten days at a time, like some kind of mutated Mr. Rogers clone? Something is dangerously wrong in any country where a monumentally-failed backwoods politician can scare our national TV networks so totally that they will give him anything he wants.","But our trip was different. It was a classic affirmation of everything right and true and decent in the national character. It was a gross, physical salute to the fantastic possibilities of life in this country-but only for those with true grit. And we were chock full of that.","The first time I managed to pick up a basketball I knew I was destined to lead the UK to another National championship. ... Even now, so many years later, I still believe Kentucky will go undefeated in March & win everything.","The thing that was important to me about Hemingway at the time was that Hemingway taught me that you could be a writer and get away with it.","I wasn\'t trying to be an outlaw writer. I never heard of that term; somebody else made it up. But we were all outside the law: Kerouac, Miller, Burroughs, Ginsberg, Kesey; I didn\'t have a gauge as to who was the worst outlaw. I just recognized allies: my people.","Fiction is based on reality unless you\'re a fairy-tale artist, you have to get your knowledge of life from somewhere. You have to know the material you\'re writing about before you alter it.","Journalism, to me, is just another drug - a free ride to scenes I\'d probably miss if I stayed straight.","Bill Clinton does not inhale marijuana, right? You bet. Like I chew on LSD but I don\'t swallow it.\'","Las Vegas is a society of armed masturbators/gambling is the kicker here/sex is extra/weird trip for high rollers ... house-whores for winners, hand jobs for the bad luck crowd.","In the terms of our Great Society the Hell\'s Angels and their ilk are losers - dropouts, failures and malcontents. They are rejects looking for a way to get even with a world in which they are only a problem.The Hell\'s Angels are not visionaries, but diehards, and if they are the forerunners or the vanguard of anything it is not the \\"moral revolution\\" in vogue on college campuses, but a fast-growing legion of young unemployables whose untapped energy will inevitably find the same kind of destructive outlet that \\"outlaws\\" like the Hell\'s Angels have been finding for years.","I think George Washington owned guns. I\'ve never seen any contradiction with that.","Jesus man! You don\'t look for acid! Acid finds you when it thinks you\'re ready.","Las Vegas: A Savage Journey to the Heart of the American Dream","Fishing from a boat seems like dilettante bullshit - like hunting wild boar with a can of spray paint from the safety of a pick-up truck","Children are like TV sets.

It\'s about the manager of a sex theater who\'s forced to leave and flee to the mountains. He falls in love and gets in even more trouble than he was in the sex theater in San Francisco. Most of my stories are tales of anguish, stress and grief.","Who knows? If there is in fact, a heaven and a hell, all we know for sure is that hell will be a viciously overcrowded version of Phoenix & a clean well lighted place full of sunshine and bromides and fast cars where almost everybody seems vaguely happy, except those who know in their hearts what is missing... And being driven slowly and quietly into the kind of terminal craziness that comes with finally understanding that the one thing you want is not there. Missing. Back-ordered. No tengo. Vaya con dios. Grow up! Small is better. Take what you can get.","Music has always been a matter of energy to me, a question of Fuel. Sentimental people call it Inspiration, but what they really mean is Fuel.","I am an Addictive Personality, they say, a natural slave to passion - and many Doctors have warned me against it. I am a High-risk Patient.","Remember this, folks - I am a Hillbilly, and I don\'t always Bet the same way I talk. Good advice is one thing, but smart gambling is quite another.","He wandered into the Newsroom and asked for a job the same way he\u2019d walk into a barbershop and ask for a haircut, and with no more idea of being turned down.","People think I watch TV too much, but they are wrong. There is a huge difference between merely \\"watching\\" TV and learning to respond aggressively to it. The difference, for most people, is the difference between the living and dying of their own brains.","Never mind the track. The track is for punks. We are Road People. We are Cafe Racers.","I harbor a secret urge to whack a salesman in the face, crack his teeth and put red bumps around his eyes.","All energy flows according to the whims of the great Magnet. What a fool I was to defy him.","I was never idle long enough to do much thinking, but I felt somehow that my instincts were right.","Fiction is based on reality unless you\'re a fairytale artist.","Don\'t have sex in the lobby - it\'s usually awkward.","Rude people will now & then ask me why I think I know so much about Politics.

You\'ll find most Southerners are like that.","I was once arrested with [Allen] Ginsburg. He was a big help to me. He was one of the few people who read unknown writer\'s work. Maybe he was just hustling me. He liked to flirt, Allen. They called him a monster but he was only falling in love.","With a bit of luck, his life was ruined forever. Always thinking that just behind some narrow door in all of his favorite bars, men in red woolen shirts are getting incredible kicks from things he\u2019ll never know.","I have learned, in my life and work as a sportswriter, that big-time Sports and big-time Politics are not so far apart in America.

Victory is good for you, and don\'t let anybody tell you different.","If you have half a story and you don\'t know the rest, you use what you have to pry the rest out of someone.","Cover a war in a place where you can\'t drink beer or talk to a woman?

Think about it.","As hideous and dumb as it sounds, I wouldn\'t be at all surprised by an invasion of Iraq on September II. I\'ll take a long shot bet on that.","That\'s where Time magazine lives ... way out there on the puzzled, masturbating edge, peering through the keyhole and selling what they see to the big wide world of chamber of commerce voyeurs who support the public prints.","There is probably some long-standing \\"rule\\" among writers, journalists, and other word-mongers that says: \\"When you start stealing from your own work you\'re in bad trouble.\\" And it may be true.","Bush is a natural-born loser with a filthy-rich daddy who pimped his son out to rich oil-mongers. He hates music, football and sex, in no particular order, and he is no fun at all.","I\'ve been studying drugs for years.","I am a writer, a professional journalist with serious credentials in Crime, Craziness, and Politics. I have mingled with dangerous criminals and attended many trials . . . from Hell\'s Angels, Black Panthers and Chicano street fighters to Roxanne Pulitzer and even Richard Nixon, back in the good old days before he was run out of the White House for fraud, perjury, graft, and criminal negligence.","Any kind of political campaign that taps the kind of energy that nothing else can reach would generate a tremendous high for everybody involved in it.","But after a while you learn to cope with things like seeing your dead grandmother crawling up your leg with a knife in her teeth.

There is no Mystery about it, and no need to change any rules.","[\\"Where the Buffalo Roam\\" is] horrible pile of crap. [Bill] Murray did a good job. But it was a bad script. You can\'t beat a bad script. It was just a horrible movie. A cartoon. But Bill Murray did a good job. We actually wrote and shot several different endings and beginnings and they all got cut out in the end. It was disappointing.","You can turn your back on a person, but never turn your back on a drug, especially when its waving a razor sharp hunting knife in your eye.","Duke is an ugly word in Kentucky.

But that would have meant going to work on a regular basis, like nine to five, with an office\x97I had to pull out.","I am a professional sportswriter, among other things, and I take the games seriously. It is only one of my many powerful addictions, and I don\'t mind admitting any of them.","Given my calling I had to stumble across people who felt the same way. I was a young reporter.","Weird behavior is natural in smart children, just as curiosity is to a kitten.","I am more than just a serious basketball fan. I am a life-long addict. I was addicted from birth, in fact, because I was born in Kentucky and I learned, early on, that Habitual Domination was a natural way of life.","Ah, fortune and fame shall follow me ... and I shall dwell in the world of the chosen for a few moments of fleeting ecstasy; ere the seven burly lads turn into creditors and hustle me off to debtors\' prison at last.","No cop was ever born who wasn\'t a sucker for a finely-executed high-speed Controlled Drift all the way around one of those clover-leaf freeway interchanges.","It might be a little rough on some people for a while, but I think it\'s the only way to deal with drugs. Look at Prohibition: all it did was make a lot of criminals rich. Should be legalized for a matter of sanity.","The years after 2000 will be a monumental change in the way life is lived here. It will be harder and harder to relate to our children. I don\'t know what it\'s going to be. I don\'t plan to be around in the year 2000. I\'ll be taken away by the Sufi God.","Nixon was so crooked that he needed servants to help him screw his pants on every morning.","I couldn\'t imagine, and I don\'t say this with any pride, but I really couldn\'t imagine writing without a desperate deadline.","[\\"Fear & Loathing in Las Vegas\\"] is a very hard book to translate to film because there\'s so much interior monologue. The what if factor. I tried to write it cinematically and let the dialogue carry it but I forgot about the interior monologue. It\'s kind of hard to show what\'s going on in the head. I think we should do it like a documentary.","Most of my stuff is just a series of false leads. I\'ll approach a story as a subject and then make a whole bunch of different runs at the lead. They\'re all good writing but they don\'t connect. So I end up having to string leads together.","Jim Harrison is someone I always enjoy, one of the great contemporary writers. I like Tim Ferris\' Big Boom Theory. I\'m getting into a different kind of reading, not straight novels.","I may sound a little black, but I\'m really pretty well adjusted.","I\'m doing an introduction for one of Ralph\'s [Steadman] books.

After five days in Vegas you feel like you\'ve been here for five years.","Sportswriters are a rude and brainless subculture of fascist drunks, a gang of vicious monkeys jerking off in a zoo cage... more disgusting by nature than maggots oozing out the carcass of a dead animal.","I got tired and embarrassed by the constant poverty of those years. I told Doug [ Brinkley] this is really going to be a horrible downer of a book [The Proud Highway] if all it\'s going to be is about being broke. I didn\'t like being reminded of desperation at all times.","I felt a strange tightness coming over me, and I reacted instinctively \u2013 for the first time in a long, long while \u2013 by slipping my notebook into my belt and reaching down to take off my watch. The first thing to go in a street fight is your watch, and once you\u2019ve lost a few, you develop a certain instinct that lets you know when it\u2019s time to get the thing off your wrist and into a safe pocket.","I was kind of relieved with the way the book [The Proud Highway] came out. It\'s beyond an autobiography or a biography. I never knew what was going to come up next.","I\'d almost prefer [Richard] Nixon. I\'d say [Bill] Clinton is every bit as corrupt as Nixon, but a lot smoother.","She was wearing the same clothes, but now she looked haggard and dirty. The delicate illusions that get us through life can only stand so much strain.","Journalism is \\"a low trade and a habit worse than heroin, a strange seedy world of misfits and drunkards and failures.","I\'m not a liberal, by the way.I believe I have every right to have guns. I just bought another huge weapon. A lot of people shouldn\'t own guns. I should. I have a safety record. Guns are a lot of fun out here.","I have long admired Ron Whitehead. He is crazy as nine loons, and his poetry is a dazzling mix of folk wisdom and pure mathematics","They don\'t hardly make \'em like him any more - but just to be on the safe side, he should be castrated anyway.","Without gambling, I would not exist.","Sometimes you\'re fooled quickly. You want to be fooled. If you can\'t trust your first impression you\'re going to have a harder time than you should.","But I am in the gambling business, for good or ill; it is the business I have chosen, and the only governing rule that we all recognize is: always sit close to an exit and never trust a man who doesn\'t sweat.","and the sad notes floated out to the patio and hung in the trees like birds too tired to fly","The Sixties were an era of extreme reality.

Mainly because I looked around and saw there wasn\'t much else I was able to do. I was a criminal. I was a juvenile delinquent.","I have always hated bowling, and I don\'t mind admitting it.","Victory is a fleeting thing in the gambling business. Today\'s winners are tomorrow\'s blinking toads, dumb beasts with no hope.","There might be some serious fun in politics.","History is hard to know, because of all the hired bullshit, but even without being sure of \\"history\\" it seems entirely reasonable to think that every now and then the energy of a whole generation comes to a head in a long fine flash, for reasons that nobody understands at the time--and which never explain, in retrospect, what actually happened.","I voted for Ralph Nader in 2000, but I will not make that mistake again. The joke is over for Nader. He was funny once, but now he belongs to the dead.","I had a truly horrible dream last night ... [Arnold Schwarzenegger, Mike Tyson and I] were on our way to a TV studio for a debate about his long-time working friendship with the powerful Bush family from Texas and how it might affect the next Bush presidency when The Terminator seizes power in Sacramento and tries to hand over the state\'s 54 electoral votes by election day in 2004. That is the basic plan behind Schwarzenegger running. He doesn\'t want to be Governor, he just wants the electoral votes to go to Bush this time.","You took too much man, too much, too much.","In San Francisco - life goes on. Hope rises and dreams flicker and die. Love plans for tomorrow and loneliness thinks of yesterday. Life is beautiful and living is pain. The sound of music floats down a dark street. A young girl looks out a window and wishes she were married. A drunk sleeps under a bridge. It is tomorrow.","We must have football. What would this country be without football in October?","Every deadline was a crisis \u2026 No doubt it has something to do with a deep-seated personality defect, or maybe a kink in whatever blood vessel leads into the pineal gland \u2026 On the other hand, it might easily be something as simple and basically perverse as whatever instinct it is that causes a jackrabbit to wait until the last possible second to dart across the road in front of a speeding car.","Some people will say that words like scum and rotten are wrong for Objective Journalism -- which is true, but they miss the point. It was the built-in blind spots of the Objective rules and dogma that allowed Nixon to slither into the White House in the first place.","There are times, however, and this is one of them, when even being right feels wrong. What do you say, for instance, about a generation that has been taught that rain is poison and sex is death?","My blood is too thick for California: I have never been able to properly explain myself in this climate.","The scene I had just witnessed (a couple making love in the ocean) brought back a lot of memories \u2013 not of things I had done but of things I had failed to do, wasted hours and frustrated moments and opportunities forever lost because time had eaten so much of my life and I would never get it back. I envied Yeoman and felt sorry for myself at the same time, because I had seen him in a moment that made all my happiness seem dull.","Kill the body and the head will die.","Life should not be a journey to the grave with the intention of arriving safely in a pretty and well-preserved body.","Myths and legends die hard in America.","Crack is ruining the drug culture.","Not even the foulest atrocities of Adolf Hitler ever shocked me so badly as these photographs did.","The next MVP of the Super Bowl is just as likely to have been a full-time grocery store bagger last year as a Heisman Trophy winner.","I\'ve already become a mastodon in print - I don\'t see a consciousness for my kind of journalism.","The person who doesn\'t scatter the morning dew will not comb gray hairs.","In four short years he has turned our country from a prosperous nation at peace into a desperately indebted nation at war.

This, along with a belief in total retaliation for any offense or insult, is what makes the Hell\'s Angels unmanageable for the police and morbidly fascinating to the general public.","I can\'t think in terms of journalism without thinking in terms of political ends. Unless there\'s been a reaction, there\'s been no journalism. It\'s cause and effect.","October is the cruelest month of any election year, but by then, the pain is so great that even the strong are like jelly and time has lost all meaning for anybody still involved in a political campaign. By that time, even candidates running unopposed have abandoned all hope of victory and live only for the day when they will finally be free to seek vengeance on all those treacherous bastards who once passed themselves off as loyal friends and allies and swore they were only in it because they all shared the same hopes and dreams.","As a senior, you may be wondering what you want to do with your life after high school. College? Travel? Get a job? Options are limitless, but it will be good to have a plan. Use the high school senior quotes about life below to come up with ideas on what you want to make of yourself after high school. The person who doesn\'t scatter the morning dew will not comb gray hairs.","I feel trapped if I know I can\'t kill myself at anytime","I don\'t think that my kind of journalism has ever been universally popular. It\'s lonely out here.","Publishers are notoriously slothful about numbers, unless they\'re attached to dollar signs - unlike journalists, quarterbacks, and felony criminal defendants who tend to be keenly aware of numbers at all times.","John F. Kennedy, who seized the White House from Richard Nixon in a frenzied campaign that turned a whole generation of young Americans into political junkies, got shot in the head for his efforts, murdered in Dallas by some hapless geek named Oswald who worked for either Castro, the mob, Jimmy Hoffa, the CIA, his dominatrix landlady or the odious, degenerate FBI chief J. Edgar Hoover. The list is long and crazy - maybe Marilyn Monroe\'s first husband fired those shots from the grassy knoll. Who knows?","It was the kind of town that made you feel like Humphrey Bogart: you came in on a bumpy little plane, and, for some mysterious reason, got a private room with a balcony overlooking the town and the harbor; then you sat there and drank until something happened.","Which is not really a hell of a lot to ask, Lord, because the final incredible truth is that I am not guilty. All I did was take your gibberish seriously... and you see where it got me? My primitive Christian instincts have made me a criminal.","Gambling can turn into a dangerous two-way street when you least expect it. Weird things happen suddenly, and your life can go all to pieces.","A man never stoops so low as when he rises to the challenge of politics.","Nixon was no more a saint than he was a great president.","I guess that\'s one of the things about growing up in the fifties - it never occurred to me that you wouldn\'t be at least as successful as your parents.","Sounds of life and movement, people getting ready and people giving up, the sound of hope and the sound of hanging on, and behind them all, the quiet, deadly ticking of a thousand hungry clocks.","Hallucinations are bad enough. But after awhile you learn to cope with things like seeing your dead grandmother crawling up your leg with a knife in her teeth. Most acid fanciers can handle this sort of thing. But nobody can handle that other trip-the possibility that any freak with $1.98 can walk into the Circus-Circus and suddenly appear in the sky over downtown Las Vegas twelve times the size of God, howling anything that comes into his head. No, this is not a good town for psychedelic drugs.","Allen [ Ginsberg] was a particular friend, one of my heroes, really. I knew him almost as long as I\'ve been writing.","There is a huge body of evidence to support the notion that me and the police were put on this earth to do extremely different things and never to mingle professionally with each other, except at official functions, when we all wear ties and drink heavily and whoop it up like the natural, good-humored wild boys that we know in our hearts that we are..These occasions are rare, but they happen - despite the forked tongue of fate that has put us forever on different paths.","right\' i said. \'but first, we need the car. and after that, the cocaine. and then the tape recorder, for special music, and some acapulco shirts.","it\'s 12 amyl nitrites (one box), in conjunction with as many beers as necessary.","Whatever he might have denied me was unimportant; it was the fact that he could deny me anything at all, even what I didn\'t want","Nixon had the unique ability to make his enemies seem honorable, and we developed a keen sense of fraternity. Some of my best friends have hated Nixon all their lives. My mother hates Nixon, my son hates Nixon, I hate Nixon, and this hatred has brought us together.","Richard Nixon looks like a flaming liberal today, compared to a golem like George Bush. Indeed. Where is Richard Nixon now that we finally need him?","I was 22 when JFK was murdered, and I will never recover from it... Never.","I measure my life in pages. If I have pages at dawn, it\'s been a good night.","Marathon running, like golf, is a game for players, not winners. That is why Callaway sells golf clubs and Nike sells running shoes. But running is unique in that the world\'s best racers are on the same course, at the same time, as amateurs, who have as much chance of winning as your average weekend warrior would scoring a touchdown in the NFL.","March is a month without mercy for rabid basketball fans. There is no such thing as a \'gentleman gambler\' when the Big Dance rolls around. All sheep will be fleeced, all fools will be punished severely... There are no Rules when the deal goes down in the final weeks of March. Even your good friends will turn into monsters.","Nixon was a bad loser. He hated losing worse than death, and that is why I enjoyed him. We were both football fans, both addicts; and on some days, nothing else mattered.","Nixon was a crook, of course, but he was also a rabid football fan - and he knew the game, which still astounds me, but I have always had a soft spot for him because of it.","I had a soft-spot in my heart for Ronald Reagan, if only because he was a sportswriter in his youth.","One thing I have learned in my painful career as a gambler is that bragging when you get lucky and win a few games will plunge you into gloom and unacceptable beatings very soon. It happens every time.","Those of us that had been up all night were in no mood for coffee and donuts, we wanted strong drink. We were, after all, the cream of the national sporting press.","By disgracing and degrading the presidency of the United States, by fleeing the White House like a diseased cur, Richard Nixon broke the heart of the American Dream.","Richard Nixon was a criminally insane Monster - Bill Clinton is a black-hearted Swine of a friend.","Quacks are a part of our culture, and we all fall prey to them. Who among us can say, for sure, that even our own personal physicians are honest and competent?","We came down here to see this teddible scene: people all pissed out of their minds and vomiting on themselves and all that and now, you know what? It\'s us","Las Vegas is the savage heart of the American Dream.","Most people who deal in words don\'t have much faith in them and I am no exception.","It is all well and good for children and acid freaks to believe in Santa Claus - but it is still a profoundly morbid day for us working professionals. It is unsettling to know that one out of every twenty people you meet on Xmas will be dead this time next year.... Some people can accept this, and some can\'t. That is why God made whiskey, and also why Wild Turkey comes in $300 shaped canisters during most of the Christmas season...","Just sick enough to be totally confident","I have stolen more quotes and thoughts and purely elegant little starbursts of writing from the Book of Revelation than anything else in the English language - and it is not because I am a biblical scholar, or because of any religious faith, but because I love the wild power of the language and the purity of the madness that governs it and makes it music.","February is always a bad month for TV sports. Football is gone, basketball is plodding along in the annual midseason doldrums, and baseball is not even mentioned.","The trouble with Nixon is that he\'s a serious politics junkie. He\'s totally hooked and like any other junkie, he\'s a bummer to have around, especially as President.","Sportswriters are a rude and brainless subculture of fascist drunks","There is a progression of understanding vis-a-vis pro football that varies drastically with the factor of distance -- physical, emotional, intellectual and every other way. Which is exactly the way it should be, in the eyes of the amazingly small number of people who own and control the game, because it is this finely managed distance factor that accounts for the high-profit mystique that blew the sacred institution of baseball off its \'\'national pastime\'\' pedestal in less than fifteen years.","There is a progression of understanding vis-\xe0-vis pro football that varies drastically with the factor of distance --physical, emotional, intellectual and every other way. . . Which is exactly the way it should be . . .","I\'ll call New York for some cash.","There was no time for scholarly details, and, besides, I have always believed that a man can fairly be judged by the standards and taste of his choices in matters of high-level plagiarism.","Las Vegas makes Reno seem like your friendly neighborhood grocery store.","There are many harsh lessons to be learned from the gambling experience, but the harshest one of all is the difference between having Fun and being Smart.","I believe that the major operating ethic in American society right now, the most universal want and need is to be on TV. I\'ve been on TV. I could be on TV all the time if I wanted to. But most people will never get on TV. It has to be a real breakthrough for them. And trouble is, people will do almost anything to get on it. You know, confess to crimes they haven\'t committed. You don\'t exist unless you\'re on TV. Yeah, it\'s a validation process.","The best thing about the Kentucky Derby is that it is only two minutes long. It is the quickest event in sports, except for Sumo-wrestling & Mike Tyson fights. Maybe Drag-racing is quicker, but I have never been attracted to it.","Yes sir, I am a tortured man for all seasons, as they say, and I have powerful friends in high places. Birds sing where I walk, and children smile when they see me coming.","and he would probably not agree with my conviction that a sense of humor is the main measure of sanity. But who can say for sure? Humor is a very private thing.","Old elephants limp off to the hills to die; old Americans go out to the highway and drive themselves to death with huge cars.","The behavior of the crowd at Churchill Downs is like 100,000 vicious Hyenas going berserk all at once in a space about the size of a 777 jet or the White House lawn.","He knew who I was, at that time, because I had a reputation as a writer. I knew he was part of the Bush dynasty. But he was nothing, he offered nothing, and he promised nothing. He had no humor. He was insignificant in every way and consequently I didn\'t pay much attention to him. But when he passed out in my bathtub, then I noticed him. I\'d been in another room, talking to the bright people. I had to have him taken away.","Richard Nixon was an evil man - evil in a way that only those who believe in the physical reality of the Devil can understand it. He was utterly without ethics or morals or any bedrock sense of decency.","The reason most people play golf is to wear clothes they would not be caught dead in otherwise.","It\'s the difference between watching a football game between two teams you don\'t care about, and watching a game where you have some kind of personal identity with one of the teams, if only a huge bet.","I keep my mouth shut now. I\'ve turned into a professional coward.","It\'s much more fun to run a political campaign than it is to be the candidate.","\\"Perceive\\" is the word that became in the \'72 campaign what \\"charisma\\" was for the 1960, \'64 and even the \'68 campaigns. \\"Perceive\\" is the new key word. When you say perceive you imply the difference between what the candidate is and the way the public or the voters see him.","I think I\'m going to have to get a flying license very soon, and maybe one of those Lear jets. It beats motorcycles all to hell.","The McGovern/McCarthy type candidacies have disappointed too many people, because of a disillusionment with the candidates themselves.","There\'s no point in getting into politics at all unless you plan to lash things around.","You almost have to be a rock star to generate the kind of fever you need to survive in American politics.","What the hell is the sense of trying to hold the Democratic party together, if it\'s really a party of expediency, something that\'s put together every four years?","Any candidate who\'d offered a real possibility of an alternative to Nixon - someone with a different concept of the presidency - could have challenged him and come very close to beating him.","I think it might be better to have the President sort of like the King of England - or the Queen - and have the real business of the presidency conducted by ... a city manager-type, a Prime Minister, somebody who\'s directly answerable to Congress, rather than a person who moves all his friends into the White House and does whatever he wants for four years.","We are all alone, born alone, die alone, and\u2014in spite of True Romance magazines\u2014we shall all someday look back on our lives and see that, in spite of our company, we were alone the whole way. I do not say lonely\u2014at least, not all the time\u2014but essentially, and finally, alone. This is what makes your self-respect so important, and I don\'t see how you can respect yourself if you must look in the hearts and minds of others for your happiness.","No sympathy for the devil; keep that in mind. Buy the ticket, take the ride...and if it occasionally gets a little heavier than what you had in mind, well...maybe chalk it up to forced consciousness expansion: Tune in, freak out, get beaten.","The Edge... There is no honest way to explain it because the only people who really know where it is are the ones who have gone over.","Too weird to live, too rare to die!","When the going gets weird, the weird turn professional.","We had two bags of grass, seventy-five pellets of mescaline, five sheets of high powered blotter acid, a salt shaker half full of cocaine, and a whole galaxy of multi-colored uppers, downers, screamers, laughers... and also a quart of tequila, a quart of rum, a case of Budweiser, a pint of raw ether and two dozen amyls.Not that we needed all that for the trip, but once you get locked into a serious drug collection, the tendency is to push it as far as you can.","Like most others, I was a seeker, a mover, a malcontent, and at times a stupid hell-raiser. I was never idle long enough to do much thinking, but I felt somehow that some of us were making real progress, that we had taken an honest road, and that the best of us would inevitably make it over the top. At the same time, I shared a dark suspicion that the life we were leading was a lost cause, that we were all actors, kidding ourselves along on a senseless odyssey. It was the tension between these two poles - a restless idealism on one hand and a sense of impending doom on the other - that kept me going.","There are times, however, and this is one of them, when even being right feels wrong. What do you say, for instance, about a generation that has been taught that rain is poison and sex is death? If making love might be fatal and if a cool spring breeze on any summer afternoon can turn a crystal blue lake into a puddle of black poison right in front of your eyes, there is not much left except TV and relentless masturbation. It\'s a strange world. Some people get rich and others eat shit and die.","All my life, my heart has sought a thing I cannot name.Remembered line from a long-forgotten poem","Strange memories on this nervous night in Las Vegas. Five years later? Six? It seems like a lifetime, or at least a Main Era\u2014the kind of peak that never comes again. San Francisco in the middle sixties was a very special time and place to be a part of. Maybe it meant something. Maybe not, in the long run . . . but no explanation, no mix of words or music or memories can touch that sense of knowing that you were there and alive in that corner of time and the world. Whatever it meant. . . .History is hard to know, because of all the hired bullshit, but even without being sure of \u201chistory it seems entirely reasonable to think that every now and then the energy of a whole generation comes to a head in a long fine flash, for reasons that nobody really understands at the time\u2014and which never explain, in retrospect, what actually happened.My central memory of that time seems to hang on one or five or maybe forty nights\u2014or very early mornings\u2014when I left the Fillmore half-crazy and, instead of going home, aimed the big 650 Lightning across the Bay Bridge at a hundred miles an hour wearing L. L. Bean shorts and a Butte sheepherder\'s jacket . . . booming through the Treasure Island tunnel at the lights of Oakland and Berkeley and Richmond, not quite sure which turn-off to take when I got to the other end (always stalling at the toll-gate, too twisted to find neutral while I fumbled for change) . . . but being absolutely certain that no matter which way I went I would come to a place where people were just as high and wild as I was: No doubt at all about that. . . .There was madness in any direction, at any hour. If not across the Bay, then up the Golden Gate or down 101 to Los Altos or La Honda. . . . You could strike sparks anywhere. There was a fantastic universal sense that whatever we were doing was right, that we were winning. . . .And that, I think, was the handle\u2014that sense of inevitable victory over the forces of Old and Evil. Not in any mean or military sense; we didn\u2019t need that. Our energy would simply prevail. There was no point in fighting\u2014on our side or theirs. We had all the momentum; we were riding the crest of a high and beautiful wave. . . .So now, less than five years later, you can go up on a steep hill in Las Vegas and look West, and with the right kind of eyes you can almost see the high-water mark\u2014that place where the wave finally broke and rolled back.\u201d","Maybe there is no Heaven. Or maybe this is all pure gibberish\u2014a product of the demented imagination of a lazy drunken hillbilly with a heart full of hate who has found a way to live out where the real winds blow\u2014to sleep late, have fun, get wild, drink whisky, and drive fast on empty streets with nothing in mind except falling in love and not getting arrested . . . Res ipsa loquitur.

One of God\'s own prototypes. A high-powered mutant of some kind never even considered for mass production. Too weird to live, and too rare to die.","America...just a nation of two hundred million used car salesmen with all the money we need to buy guns and no qualms about killing anybody else in the world who tries to make us uncomfortable","1) Never trust a cop in a raincoat.2) Beware of enthusiasm and of love, both are temporary and quick to sway.3) If asked if you care about the world\'s problems, look deep into the eyes of he who asks, he will never ask you again.4) Never give your real name.5) If ever asked to look at yourself, don\'t look.6) Never do anything the person standing in front of you can\'t understand.7) Never create anything, it will be misinterpreted, it will chain you and follow you for the rest of your life.","Weird behavior is natural in smart children, like curiosity is to a kitten.","Some people will tell you that slow is good \u2013 but I\u2019m here to tell you that fast is better.

I suspect it\'s a bit like fucking, which is only fun for amateurs. Old whores don\'t do much giggling.","The press is a gang of cruel faggots. Journalism is not a profession or a trade. It is a cheap catch-all for fuckoffs and misfits\u2014a false doorway to the backside of life, a filthy piss-ridden little hole nailed off by the building inspector, but just deep enough for a wino to curl up from the sidewalk and masturbate like a chimp in a zoo-cage.","I have never seen much point in getting heavy with stupid people or Jesus freaks, just as long as they don\'t bother me. In a world as weird and cruel as this one we have made for ourselves, I figure anybody who can find peace and personal happiness without ripping off somebody else deserves to be left alone. They will not inherit the earth, but then neither will I... And I have learned to live, as it were, with the idea that I will never find peace and happiness, either. But as long as I know there\'s a pretty good chance I can get my hands on either one of them every once in a while, I do the best I can between high spots.","Sleep late, have fun, get wild, drink whiskey and drive fast on empty streets with nothing in mind but falling in love and not getting arrested.","We are going to punish somebody for this attack, but just who or where will be blown to smithereens for it is hard to say. Maybe Afghanistan, maybe Pakistan or Iraq, or possibly all three at once. Who knows? Not even the Generals in what remains of the Pentagon or the New York papers calling for war seem to know who did it or where to look for them.This is going to be a very expensive war, and Victory is not guaranteed--for anyone, and certainly not for a baffled little creep like George W.

All he knows is that his father started the war a long time ago, and that he, the goofy child President, has been chosen by Fate and the global Oil industry to finish it off.","In a nation run by swine, all pigs are upward-mobile and the rest of us are fucked until we can put our acts together: not necessarily to win, but mainly to keep from losing completely.","Breakfast is the only meal of the day that I tend to view with the same kind of traditionalized reverence that most people associate with Lunch and Dinner. I like to eat breakfast alone, and almost never before noon; anybody with a terminally jangled lifestyle needs at least one psychic anchor every twenty-four hours, and mine is breakfast. In Hong Kong, Dallas or at home \u2014 and regardless of whether or not I have been to bed \u2014 breakfast is a personal ritual that can only be properly observed alone, and in a spirit of genuine excess. The food factor should always be massive: four Bloody Marys, two grapefruits, a pot of coffee, Rangoon crepes, a half-pound of either sausage, bacon, or corned beef hash with diced chiles, a Spanish omelette or eggs Benedict, a quart of milk, a chopped lemon for random seasoning, and something like a slice of Key lime pie, two margaritas, and six lines of the best cocaine for dessert\u2026 Right, and there should also be two or three newspapers, all mail and messages, a telephone, a notebook for planning the next twenty-four hours and at least one source of good music\u2026 All of which should be dealt with outside, in the warmth of a hot sun, and preferably stone naked.","We have become a Nazi monster in the eyes of the whole world\u2014bullies and bastards who would rather kill than live peacefully.

All those pathetically eager acid freaks who thought they could buy Peace and Understanding for three bucks a hit. But their loss and failure is ours too. What Leary took down with him was the central illusion of a whole life-style that he helped create... a generation of permanent cripples, failed seekers, who never understood the essential old-mystic fallacy of the Acid Culture: the desperate assumption that somebody... or at least some force - is tending the light at the end of the tunnel.","Take it from me, there\'s nothing like a job well done.

Get out of our way, or we\u2019ll kill you.Well, shit on that dumbness. George W. Bush does not speak for me or my son or my mother or my friends or the people I respect in this world.

Fuck them.","It seems like a lifetime, or at least a Main Era \u2014 the kind of peak that never comes again. San Francisco in the middle sixties was a very special time and place to be a part of. Maybe it meant something. Maybe not, in the long run... but no explanation, no mix of words or music or memories can touch that sense of knowing that you were there and alive in that corner of time and the world. Whatever it meant...There was madness in any direction, at any hour. You could strike sparks anywhere. There was a fantastic universal sense that whatever we were doing was right, that we were winning...And that, I think, was the handle \u2014 that sense of inevitable victory over the forces of Old and Evil. Not in any mean or military sense; we didn\'t need that. Our energy would simply PREVAIL. There was no point in fighting \u2014 on our side or theirs. We had all the momentum; we were riding the crest of a high and beautiful wave...So now, less than five years later, you can go up on a steep hill in Las Vegas and look West, and with the right kind of eyes you can almost see the high water mark \u2014 that place where the wave finally broke, and rolled back.","Ignore that nightmare in the bathroom. Just another ugly refugee from the Love Generation, some doom-struck gimp who couldn\'t handle the pressure. My attorney has never been able to accept the notion\u2014often espoused by reformed drug abusers and especially popular among those on probation\u2014that you can get a lot higher without drugs than with them. And neither have I, for that matter.","How many more of these stinking, double-downer sideshows will we have to go through before we can get ourselves straight enough to put together some kind of national election that will give me and the at least 20 million people I tend to agree with a chance to vote FOR something, instead of always being faced with that old familiar choice between the lesser of two evils?","The main problem in any democracy is that crowd-pleasers are generally brainless swine who can go out on a stage & whup their supporters into an orgiastic frenzy\u2014then go back to the office & sell every one of the poor bastards down the tube for a nickel apiece.","She laughed. \'It won\'t last. Nothing lasts. But I\'m happy now.\'\'Happy,\' I muttered, trying to pin the word down. But it is one of those words, like Love, that I have never quite understood. Most people who deal in words don\'t have much faith in them and I am no exception--especially the big ones like Happy and Love and Honest and Strong. They are too elusive and far too relative when you compare them to sharp, mean little words like Punk and Cheap and Phony. I feel at home with these, because they\'re scrawny and easy to pin, but the big ones are tough and it takes either a priest or a fool to use them with any confidence.","It was the kind of town that made you feel like Humphrey Bogart: you came in on a bumpy little plane, and, for some mysterious reason, got a private room with balcony overlooking the town and the harbor; then you sat there and drank until something happened.","Jesus! Did I SAY that? Or just think it? Was I talking? Did they hear me? I glanced over at my attorney, but he seemed oblivious...","A man who has blown all his options can\u2019t afford the luxury of changing his ways.

Not that we needed all that for the trip, but once you get locked into a serious drug collection, the tendency is to push it as far as you can. The only thing that really worried me was the ether. There is nothing in the world more helpless and irresponsible and depraved than a man in the depths of an ether binge. And I knew we\'d get into that rotten stuff pretty soon.","The whole framework of the presidency is getting out of hand. It\'s come to the point where you almost can\'t run unless you can cause people to salivate and whip on each other with big sticks. You almost have to be a rock star to get the kind of fever you need to survive in American politics.","I agreed. By this time the drink was beginning to cut the acid and my hallucinations were down to a tolerable level. The room service waiter had a vaguely reptilian cast to his features, but I was no longer seeing huge pterodactyls lumbering around the corridors in pools of fresh blood.

These are the ones who squeeze what excitement they can from life out of the imaginations and experiences of others through books and movies. These are the insignificant and forgotten men who preach conformity because it is all they know. These are the men who dream at night of what could have been, but who wake at dawn to take their places at the now-familiar rut and to merely exist through another day. For them, the romance of life is long dead and they are forced to go through the years on a treadmill, cursing their existence, yet afraid to die because of the unknown which faces them after death. They lacked the only true courage: the kind which enables men to face the unknown regardless of the consequences.","I drink much less than most people think, and I think much more than most people would believe.","I blew the horn a few times, hoping to call up an iguana.

That is why God made fast motorcycles, Bubba....","If the right people had been in charge of Nixon\'s funeral, his casket would have been launched into one of those open-sewage canals that empty into the ocean just south of Los Angeles. He was a swine of a man and a jabbering dupe of a president. Nixon was so crooked that he needed servants to help him screw his pants on every morning. Even his funeral was illegal. He was queer in the deepest way. His body should have been burned in a trash bin.","There was absolutely no choice but to cut her adrift and hope her memory was fucked.","I\'ve always considered writing the most hateful kind of work.

Two summers later we were a dead-broke nation at war with all but three or four countries in the world, and three of those don\'t count. Spain and Italy were flummoxed and and England has allowed itself to be taken over by and stigmatized by some corrupt little shyster who enjoys his slimy role as a pimp and a prostitute all at once--selling a once-proud nation of independent-thinking people down the river and into a deadly swamp of slavery to the pimps who love Jesus and George Bush and the war-crazed U.S. Pentagon.","live out where the real winds blow\u2014to sleep late, have fun, get wild, drink whisky, and drive fast on empty streets with nothing in mind except falling in love and not getting arrested . . .

That is when it matters who is President or Governor or Police Chief.

It has to be done right ... and that\'s when the strange music starts, when you stretch your luck so far that fear becomes exhilaration and vibrates along your arms.

You watch the white line and try to lean with it ... howling through a turn to the right, then to the left and down the long hill to Pacifica ... letting off now, watching for cops, but only until the next dark stretch and another few seconds on the edge ... The Edge ... There is no honest way to explain it because the only people who really know where it is are the ones who have gone over.

Our Barbie-doll president, with his Barbie-doll wife and his boxful of Barbie-doll children is also America\'s answer to the monstrous Mr. Hyde.

It is a good way to stir up a tempest in the academic quarterlies, but it won\u2019t change a word of what either man wrote, nor alter the impact of their work on the world they were writing about. Perhaps Manolete was a hoof fetishist, or suffered from terrible hemorrhoids as a result of long nights in Spanish horn parlors\u2026but he was a great matador, and it is hard to see how any amount of Freudian theorizing can have the slightest effect on the reality of the thing he did best.","The car suddenly veered off the road and we came to a sliding halt in the gravel.

What made him unique was the factthat he had no sense of detachment at all. He was like the fanatical football fan whoruns onto the field and tackles a player. He saw life as the Big Game, and the wholeof mankind was divided into two teams -- Sala\'s Boys, and The Others. The stakeswere fantastic and every play was vital -- and although he watched with a nearlyobsessive interest, he was very much the fan, shouting unheard advice in a crowd ofunheard advisors and knowing all the while that nobody was paying any attention tohim because he was not running the team and never would be.

These people should be kept at home, I thought; lock them in the basement of some goddamn Elks Club and keep them pacified with erotic movies; if they want a vacation, show them a foreign art film; and if they still aren\'t satisfied, send them into the wilderness and run them with vicious dogs.","Shoot the pasties off the nipples of a ten-foot bull-dyke and win a cotton-candy goat.","We would be attending the conference under false pretenses and dealing, from the start, with a crowd that was convened for the stated purpose of putting people like us in jail. We were the Menace - not in disguise, but stone-obvious drug abusers, with a flagrantly cranked-up act that we intended to push all the way to the limit...not to prove any final, sociological point, and not event as a conscious mockery: It was mainly a matter of life-style, a sense of obligation and even duty.

For reasons that were never made clear, I blew out my back windows with five blasts of a 12 gauge shotgun, followed moments later by six rounds from a .44 Magnum. It was a prolonged outburst of heavy firing, drunken laughter, and crashing glass. Yet the neighbors reacted with total silence. For a while I assumed that some freakish wind pocket had absorbed all the noise and carried it out to sea, but after my eviction I learned otherwise. Every one of the shots had been duly recorded on the gossip log. Another tenant in the building told me the landlord was convinced, by all the tales he\'d heard, that the interior of my apartment was reduced to rubble by orgies, brawls, fires, and wanton shooting. He had even heard stories about motorcycles being driven in and out the front door.","I was asleep when our plane hit the runway, but the jolt brought me instantly awake. I looked out the window and saw the Rocky Mountains. What the fuck was I doing here? I wondered. It made no sense at all. I decided to call my attorney as soon as possible. Have him wire me some money to buy a huge albino Doberman. Denver is a national clearing house for stolen Dobermans; they come from all parts of the country.","Sounds of a San Juan night, drifting across the city through layers of humid air; sounds of life and movement, people getting ready and people giving up, the sound of hope and the sound of hanging on, and behind them all, the quiet, deadly ticking of a thousand hungry clocks, the lonely sound of time passing in the long Caribbean night.","I bought a small bottle of beer for fifteen cents and sat on a bench in the clearing, feeling like an old man. The scene I had just witnessed brought back a lot of memories - not of things I had done but of things I had failed to do, wasted hours and frustrated moments and opportunities forever lost because time had eaten so much of my life and I would never get it back.","The Circus-Circus is what the whole hep world would be doing Saturday night if the Nazis had won the war.

One day you run everything, and the next dayyou run like a dog.","It was necessary, we felt, to thoroughly terrify our opponents, so that even in hollow victory, they would learn to fear every sunrise ...","So now, less than five years later, you can go up on a steep hill in Las Vegas and look West, and with the right kind of eyes you can almost see the high-water mark\u2014that place where the wave finally broke and rolled back.","There is an important difference between the words \'losers\' and \'outlaw.\' One is passive and the other is active, and the main reason the Angels are such good copy is that they are acting out the day-dreams of millions of losers who don\'t wear any defiant insignia and who don\'t know how to be outlaws. The streets of every city are thronged with men who would pay all the money they could get their hands on to be transformed-even for a day-into hairy, hard-fisted brutes who walk over cops, extort free drinks from terrified bartenders and thunder out of town on big motorcycles after raping the banker\'s daughter. Even people who think the Angels should all be put to sleep find it easy to identify with them. They command a fascination, however reluctant, that borders on psychic masturbation.","The only way to prepare for a trip like this, I felt, was to dress up like human peacocks and get crazy, then screech off across the desert and cover the story.","This wavering paradox is a pillar of the outlaw stance. A man who has blown all his options can\'t afford the luxury of changing his ways. He has to capitalize on whatever he has left, and he can\'t afford to admit-no matter how often he\'s reminded of it-that every day of his life takes him farther down a blind alley.","One of the things you learn, after years of dealing with drug people, is that everything is serious. You can turn your back on a person, but never turn your back on a drug\u2014especially when it\u2019s waving a razor-sharp hunting knife in your eyes.","There was also the fact that sending a penniless writer to get $135 worth of beer was \u2014 as Khrushchev said of Nixon \u2014 \'like sending a goat to tend the cabbage\'.","Some book reviewer whose name I forget recently called me a \'vicious misanthrope\' . . . or maybe it was a \'cynical misanthrope\'. . . but either way, he (or she) was right; and what got me this way was politics.","I was never idle long enough to do much thinking, but I felt somehow that my instincts were right. I shared a vagrant optimism that some of us were making real progress, that we had taken an honest road, and that the best of us would inevitably make it over the top.I shared a dark suspicion that the life we were leading was a lost cause, that we were all actors, kidding ourselves along on a senseless journey. It was the tension between these two poles--a restless idealism on one hand and a sense of impending doom on the other--that kept me going.","Across the board... Not junkies or freaks, but people who were just as comfortable with drugs like weed, booze, or coke as we are - and we\'re not weird, are we? Hell no, we\'re just overworked professionals who need to relax now and then, have a bit of the whoop and the giggle, right?","It had been a bad trip ... fast and wild in some moments, slow and dirty in others, but on balance it looked like a bummer. On my way back to San Francisco, I tried to compose a fitting epitaph. I wanted something original, but there was no escaping the echo of Mistah Kurtz\' final words from the heart of darkness: \\"The horror! The horror! ... Exterminate all the brutes!","There was no sense in blowing everything away for the sake of some violent ape I\'d never even met.","You will be flogged for being right and flogged for being wrong, and it hurts both ways--but it doesn\'t hurt as much when you\'re right.","He talked about luck and fate and numbers coming up, yet he never ventured a nickel at the casinos because he knew the house had all the percentages. And beneath his pessimism, his bleak conviction that all the machinery was rigged against him, at the bottom of his soul was a faith that he was going to outwit it, that by carefully watching the signs he was going to know when to dodge and be spared. It was fatalism with a loophole, and all you had to do to make it work was never miss a sign. Survival by coordination, as it were. The race is not to the swift, nor the battle to the strong, but to those who can see it coming and jump aside. Like a frog evading a shillelagh in a midnight marsh.","In a nervous society where a man\u2019s image is frequently more important than his reality, the only people who can afford to advertise their drug menus are those with nothing to lose.","They claimed no allegiance to any flag and valued no currency but luck and good contacts.","My own acid-eating experience is limited in terms of total consumption, but widely varied as to company and circumstances ... and if I had a choice of repeating any one of the half dozen bouts I recall, I would choose one of those Hell\'s Angels parties in La Honda, complete with all the mad lighting, cops on the road, a Ron Boise sculpture looming out of the woods, and all the big speakers vibrating with Bob Dylan\'s \\"Mr. Tambourine Man.\\" It was a very electric atmosphere. If the Angels lent a feeling of menace, they also made it more interesting ... and far more alive than anything likely to come out of a controlled experiment or a politely brittle gathering of well-educated truth-seekers looking for wisdom in a capsule. Dropping acid with the Angels was an adventure; they were too ignorant to know what to expect, and too wild to care. They just swallowed the stuff and hung on ... which is probably just as dangerous as the experts say, but a far, far nuttier trip than sitting in some sterile chamber with a condescending guide and a handful of nervous, would-be hipsters.","The best fiction is far more true than any kind of journalism.","Maybe it meant something. Maybe not, in the long run\u2026 but no explanation, no mix of words or music or memories can touch that sense of knowing that you were there and alive in that corner of time and the world. Whatever it meant.\u2026And that, I think, was the handle\u2014that sense of inevitable victory over the forces of Old and Evil. Not in any mean or military sense; we didn\'t need that. Our energy would simply prevail. There was no point in fighting\u2014on our side or theirs. We had all the momentum; we were riding the crest of a high and beautiful wave.","The only way to write honestly about the scene is to be part of it. If there is one quick truism about psychedelic drugs, it is that anyone who tries to write about them without first-expierience is a fool and a fraud.","Drive fast on empty streets with nothing in mind except falling in love and not getting arrested.","Who is the happier man, he who has braved the storm of life and lived or he who has stayed securely on shore and merely existed?","This place is like the Army: the shark ethic prevails--eat the wounded. In a closed society where everybody\'s guilty, the only crime is getting caught. In a world of thieves, the only final sin is stupidity.","How many more nights and weird mornings can this terrible shit go on? How long can the body and the brain tolerate this doom-struck craziness? This grinding of teeth, this pouring of sweat, this pounding of blood in the temples\u2026 small blue veins gone amok in front of the ears, sixty and seventy hours with no sleep.","Now off the escalator and into the casino, big crowds still tight around the crap tables. Who are these people? These faces! Where do they come from? They look like caricatures of used-car dealers from Dallas. But they\u2019re real. And, sweet Jesus, there are a hell of a lot of them \u2013 still screaming around these desert-city crap tables at four-thirty on a Sunday morning. Still humping the American Dream, that vision of the Big Winner somehow emerging from the last- minute pre-dawn chaos of a stale Vegas casino.","There was also the socio-psychic factor. Every now and then when your life gets complicated and the weasels start closing in, the only real cure is to load up on heinous chemicals and then drive like a bastard from Hollywood to Las Vegas. To relax, as it were, in the womb of the desert sun. Just roll the roof back and screw it on, grease the face with white tanning butter and move out with the music at top volume, and at least a pint of ether.","a generation of permanent cripples, failed seekers, who never understood the essential old-mystic fallacy of the Acid Culture: the desperate assumption that somebody\u2014or at least some force\u2014is tending that Light at the end of the tunnel. This is the same cruel and paradoxically benevolent bullshit that has kept the Catholic Church going for so many centuries. It is also the military ethic \u2026 a blind faith in some higher and wiser \u201cauthority. The Pope, The General, The Prime Minister \u2026 all the way up to \u201cGod.\u201d","To give advice to a man who asks what to do with his life implies something very close to egomania. To presume to point a man to the right and ultimate goal \u2014 to point with a trembling finger in the RIGHT direction is something only a fool would take upon himself.","Life just seems too huge and too fascinating for me to begin thinking about curing my restlessness at this stage of the game. Maybe later.","I am still vaguely haunted by our hitchhiker\u2019s remark about how he\u2019d \u201cnever rode in a convertible before. Here\u2019s this poor geek living in a world of convertibles zipping past him on the highways all the time, and he\u2019s never even ridden in one. It made me feel like King Farouk. I was tempted to have my attorney pull into the next airport and arrange some kind of simple, common-law contract whereby we could just give the car to this unfortunate bastard. Just say: \u201cHere, sign this and the car\u2019s yours.\u201d Give him the keys and then use the credit card to zap off on a jet to some place like Miami and rent another huge fireapple-red convertible for a drug-addled, top-speed run across the water all the way out to the last stop in Key West \u2026 and then trade the car off for a boat. Keep moving. But this manic notion passed quickly. There was no point in getting this harmless kid locked up\u2014and, besides, I had plans for this car. I was looking forward to flashing around Las Vegas in the bugger. Maybe do a bit of serious drag-racing on the Strip: Pull up to that big stoplight in front of the Flamingo and start screaming at the traffic: \u201cAlright, you chickenshit wimps! You pansies! When this goddamn light flips green, I\u2019m gonna stomp down on this thing and blow every one of you gutless punks off the road!\u201d Right. Challenge the bastards on their own turf.

Revving the engine up to a terrible high-pitched chattering whine, waiting for the light to change \u2026 How often does a chance like that come around? To jangle the bastards right down to the core of their spleens. Old elephants limp off to the hills to die; old Americans go out to the highway and drive themselves to death with huge cars.\u201d","Living on pills, phone calls unmade, people unseen, pages unwritten, money unmade, pressure piling up all around to make some kind of breakthrough and get moving again. Get the gum off the rails, finish something, croak this awful habit of not ever getting to the end- of anything.","Security ... what does this word mean in relation to life as we know it today? For the most part, it means safety and freedom from worry. It is said to be the end that all men strive for; but is security a utopian goal or is it another word for rut?Let us visualize the secure man; and by this term, I mean a man who has settled for financial and personal security for his goal in life. In general, he is a man who has pushed ambition and initiative aside and settled down, so to speak, in a boring, but safe and comfortable rut for the rest of his life. His future is but an extension of his present, and he accepts it as such with a complacent shrug of his shoulders. His ideas and ideals are those of society in general and he is accepted as a respectable, but average and prosaic man. But is he a man? has he any self-respect or pride in himself? How could he, when he has risked nothing and gained nothing? What does he think when he sees his youthful dreams of adventure, accomplishment, travel and romance buried under the cloak of conformity? How does he feel when he realizes that he has barely tasted the meal of life; when he sees the prison he has made for himself in pursuit of the almighty dollar? If he thinks this is all well and good, fine, but think of the tragedy of a man who has sacrificed his freedom on the altar of security, and wishes he could turn back the hands of time. A man is to be pitied who lacked the courage to accept the challenge of freedom and depart from the cushion of security and see life as it is instead of living it second-hand. Life has by-passed this man and he has watched from a secure place, afraid to seek anything better What has he done except to sit and wait for the tomorrow which never comes?Turn back the pages of history and see the men who have shaped the destiny of the world. Security was never theirs, but they lived rather than existed. Where would the world be if all men had sought security and not taken risks or gambled with their lives on the chance that, if they won, life would be different and richer? It is from the bystanders (who are in the vast majority) that we receive the propaganda that life is not worth living, that life is drudgery, that the ambitions of youth must he laid aside for a life which is but a painful wait for death. These are the ones who squeeze what excitement they can from life out of the imaginations and experiences of others through books and movies. These are the insignificant and forgotten men who preach conformity because it is all they know. These are the men who dream at night of what could have been, but who wake at dawn to take their places at the now-familiar rut and to merely exist through another day. For them, the romance of life is long dead and they are forced to go through the years on a treadmill, cursing their existence, yet afraid to die because of the unknown which faces them after death. They lacked the only true courage: the kind which enables men to face the unknown regardless of the consequences.As an afterthought, it seems hardly proper to write of life without once mentioning happiness; so we shall let the reader answer this question for himself: who is the happier man, he who has braved the storm of life and lived or he who has stayed securely on shore and merely existed?","When you bring an act into this town, you want to bring it in heavy. Don\u2019t waste any time with cheap shucks and misdemeanors. Gostraight for the jugular. Get right into felonies.","Every time I think of Tim Leary I get angry. He was a liar and a quack and a worse human being than Richard Nixon. For the last twenty-six years of his life he worked as an informant for the FBI and turned his friends into the police and betrayed the peace symbol he hid behind.","Well\u2026 maybe so. This may be the year when we finally come face to face with ourselves; finally just lay back and say it\u2014that we are really just a nation of 220 million used car salesmen with all the money we need to buy guns, and no qualms at all about killing anybody else in the world who tries to make us uncomfortable. The tragedy of all this is that George McGovern, for all his mistakes and all his imprecise talk about \u201cnew politics and \u201chonesty in government,\u201d is one of the few men who\u2019ve run for President of the United States in this century who really understands what a fantastic monument to all the best instincts of the human race this country might have been, if we could have kept it out of the hands of greedy little hustlers like Richard Nixon. McGovern made some stupid mistakes, but in context they seem almost frivolous compared to the things Richard Nixon does every day of his life, on purpose, as a matter of policy and a perfect expression of everything he stands for. Jesus! Where will it end? How low do you have to stoop in this country to be President?\u201d","But in a society with no central motivation, so far adrift and puzzled with itself that its President feels called upon to appoint a Committee on National Goals, a sense of alienation is likely to be very popular--especially among people young enough to shrug off the guilt they\'re suppose to feel for deviating from a goal or purpose they never understood in the first place. Let the old people wallow in the shame of having failed. The laws they made to preserve a myth are no longer pertinent; the so called American Way begins to seem like a dike made of cheap cement, with many more leaks than the law has fingers to plug. America has been breeding mass anomie since the end of World War II. It is not a political thing, but the sense of new realities, or urgency, anger and sometimes desperation in a society where even the highest authorities seem to be grasping at straws.","I still believe that a car with the gas needle on empty can run about fifty more miles if you have the right music very loud on the radio.","But from now on let\'s try to be careful when we\'re around people I know. You won\'t sketch them and I won\'t Mace them. We\'ll just try to relax and get drunk.","I was glad to be rid of him. He was one of those people who could go to New York and be \\"fascinating,\\" but here in his own world he was just a cheap functionary, and a dull one at that.","Strange memories on this nervous night in Las Vegas. Five years later? Six? It seems like a lifetime, or at least a Main Era\u2014the kind of peak that never comes again. San Francisco in the middle sixties was a very special time and place to be a part of. Maybe it meant something. Maybe not, in the long run\u2026 but no explanation, no mix of words or music or memories can touch that sense of knowing that you were there and alive in that corner of time and the world. Whatever it meant.\u2026History is hard to know, because of all the hired bullshit, but even without being sure of \\"history\\" it seems entirely reasonable to think that every now and then the energy of a whole generation comes to a head in a long fine flash, for reasons that nobody really understands at the time\u2014and which never explain, in retrospect, what actually happened.My central memory of that time seems to hang on one or five or maybe forty nights\u2014or very early mornings\u2014when I left the Fillmore half-crazy and, instead of going home, aimed the big 650 Lightning across the Bay Bridge at a hundred miles an hour wearing L. L. Bean shorts and a Butte sheepherder\'s jacket\u2026 booming through the Treasure Island tunnel at the lights of Oakland and Berkeley and Richmond, not quite sure which turn-off to take when I got to the other end (always stalling at the toll-gate, too twisted to find neutral while I fumbled for change)... but being absolutely certain that no matter which way I went I would come to a place where people were just as high and wild as I was: No doubt at all about that\u2026There was madness in any direction, at any hour. If not across the Bay, then up the Golden Gate or down 101 to Los Altos or La Honda.\u2026 You could strike sparks anywhere. There was a fantastic universal sense that whatever we were doing was right, that we were winning.\u2026And that, I think, was the handle\u2014that sense of inevitable victory over the forces of Old and Evil. Not in any mean or military sense; we didn\'t need that. Our energy would simply prevail. There was no point in fighting\u2014on our side or theirs. We had all the momentum; we were riding the crest of a high and beautiful wave.\u2026So now, less than five years later, you can go up on a steep hill in Las Vegas and look West, and with the right kind of eyes you can almost see the high-water mark\u2014that place where the wave finally broke and rolled back.","The point is valid: the difference between survival and wipe-out in a physical crisis is nearly always a matter of conditioned reflexes.","You\'d better take care of me, Lord. If you don\'t, you\'re gonna have me on your hands.","Richard Nixon has never been one of my favorite people, anyway. For years I\'ve regarded his very existence as a monument to all the rancid genes and broken chromosomes that corrupt the possibilities of the American Dream; he was a foul caricature of himself, a man with no soul, no inner convictions, with the integrity of a hyena and the style of a poison toad.","Journalism is not a profession or a trade. It is a cheap catch-all for fuckoffs and misfits\u2014a false doorway to the backside of life, a filthy piss-ridden little hole nailed off by the building inspector, but just deep enough for a wino to curl up from the sidewalk and masturbate like a chimp in a zoo-cage.","On the way down the hill we walked three abreast in the cobblestone street, drunk and laughing and talking like men who knew they would separate at dawn and travel to the far corners of the earth.","These are bad times for people who like to sit outside the library at dawn on a rainy morning and get ripped to the tits on crank and powerful music.","It\'s Your World...Pay Attention","I wondered if maybe this kind of thing happened all the time in Vegas -- cars full of late-arriving passengers screeching desperately across the runway, dropping off wild eyed Samoans clutching mysterious canvas bags who would sprint onto planes at the last possible second and then roar off into the sunrise.","As for LSD, I highly recommend it. We had a fine, wild weekend and no trouble at all. The feeling it produces is hard to describe. \'Intensity\' is a fair word for it. Try half a cube at first, just sit in the living room and turn on the music - after the kids have gone to bed. But never take it in uncomfortable or socially tense situations. And don\'t have anybody around whom you don\'t like.","The line between madness and masochism was already hazy;","I suspect we could have done the whole thing on acid \u2026 except for some of the people; there were faces and bodies in that group who would have been absolutely unendurable on acid.","This is one of the hallmarks of Vegas hospitality.

Despite some grim moments, their parents seem to have had credit. Most of the outlaws are the sons of people who came to California either just before or during World War II. Many have lost contact with their families, and I have never met an Angel who claimed to have a hometown in any sense that people who use that term might understand it. Terry the Tramp, for instance, is \\"from\\" Detroit, Norfolk, Long Island, Los Angeles, Fresno and Sacramento. As a child, he lived all over the country, not in poverty but in total mobility. Like most of the others, he has no roots. He relates entirely to the present, the moment, the action.","The New York power failure was not the first time the Hell\'s Angels have confounded the forces of decency and got off scot-free. They are incredibly devious. Law enforcement officials have compared their guile to that of the snipe, a wily beast that many have seen but few have ever trapped. This is because the snipe has the ability to transform himself, when facing capture, into something entirely different. The only other animals capable of this are the werewolf and the Hell\'s Angel, which have many traits in common. The physical resemblance is obvious, but far more important is the transmogrification factor, the strange ability to alter their own physical structure, and hence \\"disappear.\\" The Hell\'s Angels are very close-mouthed about this, but it is a well-known fact among public officials. ... About halfway through our talk I got a strong whiff of the transmogrification factor, but I was hardly prepared for the mayor\'s special fillip on it. There were plenty of Hell\'s Angels at the riot, \\"but they escaped, \\" he explained, \\"behind a wall of fire.\\" While he elaborated on this I checked my calendar to make sure I hadn\'t lost track of the days. If it was Sunday, perhaps he had just come back from church in a high, biblical state of mind. At any moment I expected to hear that the Angels had driven their motorcycles straight into the sea, which had rolled back to let them pass. But no, it wasn\'t like that. The mayor was not loath to give details of the escape; he wanted law enforcement agencies everywhere to be warned of the Angels\' methods. Knowledge is power, he opined.","The two keys to success as a sportswriter are: 1) A blind willingness to believe anything you\'re told by the coaches, flacks, hustlers and other \\"official spokesmen\\" for the team-owners who provide the free booze ... and: 2) A Roget\'s Thesaurus, in order to avoid using the same verbs and adjectives twice in the same paragraph.Even a sports editor, for instance, might notice something wrong with a lead that said: \\"The precision-jack-hammer attack of the Miami Dolphins stomped the balls off the Washington Redskins today by stomping and hammering with one precise jack-thrust after another up the middle, mixed with pinpoint-precision passes into the flat and numerous hammer-jack stomps around both ends....","In a generation of swine, the one-eyed pig is king.","I\u2019m bound to go to heaven because I\u2019ve already served my time in hell.","California, Labor Day weekend...early, with ocean fog still in the streets, outlaw motorcyclists wearing chains, shades and greasy Levis roll out from damp garages, all-night diners and cast-off one-night pads in Fricso, Hollywood, Berdoo and East Oakland, heading for the Monterey peninsula, north of Big Sur...The Menace is loose again, the Hell\'s Angels, the hundred-carat headline, running fast and loud on the early morning freeway, low in the saddle, nobody smiles, jamming crazy through traffic and ninety miles an hour down the center stripe, missing by inches...like Genghis Khan on an iron horse, a monster steed with a fiery anus, flat out through the eye of a beer can and up your daughter\'s leg with no quarter asked and non given; show the squares some class, give em a whiff of those kicks they\'ll never know...Ah, these righteous dudes, they love to screw it on...Little Jesus, the Gimp, Chocolate George, Buzzard, Zorro, Hambone, Clean Cut, Tiny, Terry the Tramp, Frenchy, Mouldy Marvin, Mother Miles, Dirty Ed, Chuck the Duck, Fat Freddy, Filthy Phil, Charger Charley the Child Molester, Crazy Cross, Puff, Magoo, Animal and at least a hundred more...tense for the action, long hair in the wind, beards and bandanas flapping, earrings, armpits, chain whips, swastikas and stripped-down Harleys flashing chrome as traffic on 101 moves over, nervous, to let the formation pass like a burst of dirty thunder...","Stand in front of this fantastic machine, my friend, and for just 99\xa2 your likeness will appear, two hundred feet tall, on a screen above downtown Las Vegas.

Sounds of a San Juan night, drifting across the city through layers of humid air; sounds of life and movement, people getting ready and people giving up, the sound of hope and the sound of hanging on, and behind them all, the quiet, deadly ticking of a thousand hungry clocks, the lonely sound of time passing in the long Caribbean night.","Las Vegas is not the kind of town where you want to drive down Main Street aiming a black bazooka-looking instrument at people.","Oh ignorant youth, the world is not a joyous place.","They would owe most of their success to a curious rape mania that rides on the shoulder of American journalism like some jeering, masturbating raven.Nothing grabs an editor\'s eye like a good rape.","The only thing I ever saw that came close to Objective Journalism was a closed-circuit TV setup that watched shoplifters in the General Store at Woody Creek, Colorado.","At the stroke of midnight in Washington, a drooling red-eyed beast with the legs of a man and a head of a giant hyena crawls out of its bedroom window in the South Wing of the White House and leaps fifty feet down to the lawn...pauses briefly to strangle the Chow watchdog, then races off into the darkness...towards the Watergate, snarling with lust, loping through the alleys behind Pennsylvania Avenue, and trying desperately to remember which one of those fore hundred identical balconies is the one outside of Martha Mitchell\'s apartment....Ah...Nightmares, nightmares.

Instead of institutionalizing common knowledge, in the style of Time, it told a story that was only beginning to happen and which was inevitably influenced by the film. It gave the outlaws a lasting, romance-glazed image of themselves, a coherent reflection that only a very few had been able to find in a mirror, and it quickly became the bike rider\'s answer to The Sun Also Rises. The image is not valid, but its wide acceptance can hardly be blamed on the movie. The Wild One was careful to distinguish between \\"good outlaws\\" and \\"bad outlaws,\\" but the people who were most influenced chose to identify with Brando instead of Lee Marvin whose role as the villain was a lot more true to life than Brando\'s portrayal of the confused hero. They saw themselves as modern Robin Hoods ... virile, inarticulate brutes whose good instincts got warped somewhere in the struggle for self-expression and who spent the rest of their violent lives seeking revenge on a world that done them wrong when they were young and defenseless.","You people voted for Hubert Humphrey and killed Jesus!","If the thing bites down much harder I might wig out and demand beer... stay away from the phone, watch the red arrow... this typewriter is keeping me on my rails, without it I\'d be completely adrift and weird.","Ignore that nightmare in the bathroom.

The beach was white as salt, and cut off from the world by a ring of steep hills that faced the sea.

I wanted to take off all my clothes and never wear them again.","Far from being freaks, the Hell\'s Angels are a logical product of the culture that now claims to be shocked at their existence. The generation represented by the editors of Time has lived so long in a world full of Celluloid outlaws hustling toothpaste and hair oil that it is no longer capable of confronting the real thing. For twenty years they have sat with their children and watched yesterday\'s outlaws raise hell with yesterday\'s world ... and now they are bringing up children who think Jesse James is a television character. This is the generation that went to war for Mom, God and Apple Butter, the American Way of Life. When they came back, they crowned Eisenhower and then retired to the giddy comfort of their TV parlors, to cultivate the subtleties of American history as seen by Hollywood.","When you\'re asked to stay out of a bar you don\'t just punch the owner--you come back with your army and tear the place down, destroy the whole edifice and everything it stands for. No compromise. If a man gets wise, mash his face. If a woman snubs you, rape her. This is the thinking, if not the reality, behind the whole Hell\'s Angels act.","I\u2019ve spent enough time in jackrabbit country to know that most of them lead pretty dull lives . . . No wonder some of them drift over the line into cheap thrills once in a while; there has to be a powerful adrenaline rush in crouching by the side of a road, waiting for the next set of headlights to come along, then streaking out of the bushes with split-second timing and making it across to the other side just inches in front of the speeding front wheels.","It was a Different Time. People were Friendly. We trusted each other. Hell, you could afford to get mixed up with wild strangers in those days -- without fearing for your life, or your eyes, or your organs, or all of your money, or even getting locked up in prison forever. There was a sense of possibility. People were not so afraid, as they are now. You could run around naked without getting shot. You could check into a roadside motel on the outskirts of Ely or Winnemucca or Elko where you were lost in a midnight rainstorm -- and nobody called the police on you, just to check out your credit and your employment history and your medical records and how many parking tickets you owed in California.","One of the strangest things about these five downhill years of the Nixon presidency is that despite all the savage excesses committed by the people he chose to run the country, no real opposition or realistic alternative to Richard Nixon\u2019s cheap and mean-hearted view of the American Dream has ever developed. It is almost as if that sour 1968 election rang down the curtain on career politicians. This is the horror of American politics today - not that Richard Nixon and his fixers have been crippled, convicted, indicted, disgraced and even jailed - but that the only available alternatives are not much better; the same dim collection of burned-out hacks who have been fouling our air with their gibberish for the last tenty years. How long, oh Lord, how long? And how much longer will we have to wait before some high-powered shark with a fistful of answers will finally bring us face-to-face with the ugly question that is already so close to the surface in this country, that sooner or later even politicians will have to cope with it? Is this democracy worth all the risks and problems that necessarily go with it? Or, would we all be happier by admitting that the whole thing was a lark from the start and now that it hasn\u2019t worked out, to hell with it.","There is a beautiful consistency about Buzzard; he is a porcupine among men, with his quills always flared. If he won a new car with a raffle ticket bought in his name by some momentary girlfriend, he would recognize it at once as a trick to con him out of a license fee. He would denounce the girl as a hired slut, beat up the raffle sponsor, and trade off the car for five hundred Seconals and a gold-handled cattle prod.","Justice is not cheap in this country, and people who insist on it are usually either desperate or possessed by some private determination bordering on monomania.","I like this book and I especially like the title. Only a fool or a whore would call it anything else.","If we start electing presidents on the basis of their sexual purity, some real monsters will get into the White House.","Algren\u2019s book opens with one of the best historical descriptions of American white trash ever written.* He traces the Linkhorn ancestry back to the first wave of bonded servants to arrive on these shores. These were the dregs of society from all over the British Isles\u2014misfits, criminals, debtors, social bankrupts of every type and description\u2014all of them willing to sign oppressive work contracts with future employers in exchange for ocean passage to the New World. Once here, they endured a form of slavery for a year or two\u2014during which they were fed and sheltered by the boss\u2014and when their time of bondage ended, they were turned loose to make their own way. In theory and in the context of history the setup was mutually advantageous. Any man desperate enough to sell himself into bondage in the first place had pretty well shot his wad in the old country, so a chance for a foothold on a new continent was not to be taken lightly. After a period of hard labor and wretchedness he would then be free to seize whatever he might in a land of seemingly infinite natural wealth. Thousands of bonded servants came over, but by the time they earned their freedom the coastal strip was already settled. The unclaimed land was west, across the Alleghenies. So they drifted into the new states\u2014Kentucky and Tennessee; their sons drifted on to Missouri, Arkansas and Oklahoma. Drifting became a habit; with dead roots in the Old World and none in the New, the Linkhorns were not of a mind to dig in and cultivate things. Bondage too became a habit, but it was only the temporary kind. They were not pioneers, but sleazy rearguard camp followers of the original westward movement. By the time the Linkhorns arrived anywhere the land was already taken\u2014so they worked for a while and moved on. Their world was a violent, boozing limbo between the pits of despair and the Big Rock Candy Mountain. They kept drifting west, chasing jobs, rumors, homestead grabs or the luck of some front-running kin. They lived off the surface of the land, like army worms, stripping it of whatever they could before moving on. It was a day-to-day existence, and there was always more land to the west. Some stayed behind and their lineal descendants are still there\u2014in the Carolinas, Kentucky, West Virginia and Tennessee. There were dropouts along the way: hillbillies, Okies, Arkies\u2014they\u2019re all the same people. Texas is a living monument to the breed. So is southern California. Algren called them \u201cfierce craving boys with \u201ca feeling of having been cheated.\u201d Freebooters, armed and drunk\u2014a legion of gamblers, brawlers and whorehoppers. Blowing into town in a junk Model-A with bald tires, no muffler and one headlight \u2026 looking for quick work, with no questions asked and preferably no tax deductions. Just get the cash, fill up at a cut-rate gas station and hit the road, with a pint on the seat and Eddy Arnold on the radio moaning good back-country tunes about home sweet home, that Bluegrass sweetheart still waitin, and roses on Mama\u2019s grave. Algren left the Linkhorns in Texas, but anyone who drives the Western highways knows they didn\u2019t stay there either. They kept moving until one day in the late 1930s they stood on the spine of a scrub-oak California hill and looked down on the Pacific Ocean\u2014the end of the road.\u201d","Fear? I know not fear. There are only moments of confusion.","Listening to him, I realized how long it had been since I\u2019d felt like I had the world by the balls, how many quick birthdays had gone by since that first year in Europe when I was so ignorant and so confident that every splinter of luck made me feel like a roaring champion.","I remember being stunned at the New York skyline as I drove over this big freeway, coming across the flats in Seacaucus. All of a sudden it was looming up in front of me and I almost lost control of the car. I thought it was a vision.","The strategy worked like a charm, and in 1980 Jimmy Carter was swept away like offal by the \u201cReagan Revolution, which ushered in eight years of berserk looting of the federal treasury and the economic crippling of the middle class. That was the eighties, folks. That was the feeding frenzy of the New Rich, who found themselves wallowing in excess profits as their maximum income tax rate got chopped down to 31 percent and who were welcomed like brothers in the White House at all hours of the day or night.\u201d","There was only one road back to L.A. - U.S. Interstate 15. Just a flat-out high speed burn through Baker and Barstow and Berdoo. Then onto the Hollywood Freeway, and straight on into frantic oblivion. Safety. Obscurity.","The trade is meaningless. It is like trading a used mattress for a $300 bill.","The importance of Liking Yourself is a notion that fell heavily out of favor during the coptic, anti-ego frenzy of the Acid Era\u2014but nobody guessed, back then, that the experiment might churn up this kind of hangover: a whole subculture of frightened illiterates with no faith in anything.","It is Autumn, as you know, and things are beginning to die. It is so wonderful to be out in the crisp Fall air, with the leaves turning gold and the grass turning brown and the warmth going out of the sunlight and big hot fires in the fireplace while Buddy rakes the lawn.

It puzzled them to be treated as symbolic heroes by people with whom they had almost nothing in common. Yet they were gaining access to a whole reservoir of women, booze, drugs and new action -- which they were eager to get their hands on, and symbolism be damned. But they could never get the hang of the role they were expected to play, and insisted on ad-libbing the lines. This fouled their channels of communication, which made them nervous ... and after a brief whirl on the hipster party circuit, all but a few decided it was both cheaper and easier, in the long run, to buy their own booze and hustle a less complicated breed of pussy.","Real happiness, in politics, is a wide-open hammer shot on some poor bastard who knows he\'s been trapped, but can\'t flee.","I have explained many times that I am, by Profession, a Gambler -- not some jock-sniffing nerd or a hired human squawk-box with the brain of a one-cell animal. No. That would be your average career sportswriter -- and, more specifically, a full-time Baseball writer.","Now, looking for labels, it is hard to call the Hell\'s Angels anything but mutants. They are urban outlaws with a rural ethic and a new, improvised style of self-preservation. Their image of themselves derives mainly from Celluloid, from the Western movies and two-fisted TV shows that have taught them most of what they know about the society they live in. Very few read books, and in most cases their formal education ended at fifteen or sixteen. What little they know of history has come from the mass media, beginning with comics ... so if they see themselves in terms of the past, it\'s because they can\'t grasp the terms of the present, much less the future. They are the sons of poor men and drifters, losers and the sons of losers. Their backgrounds are overwhelmingly ordinary. As people, they are like millions of other people. But in their collective identity they have a peculiar fascination so obvious that even the press has recognized it, although not without cynicism. In its ritual flirtation with reality the press has viewed the Angels with a mixture of awe, humor and terror -- justified, as always, by a slavish dedication to the public appetite, which most journalists find so puzzling and contemptible that they have long since abandoned the task of understanding it to a handful of poll-takers and \\"experts.","The prevailing quality of life in America -- by any accepted methods of measuring -- was unarguably freer and more politically open under Nixon than it is today in this evil year of Our Lord 2002.","A drug person can learn to cope with things like seeing their dead grandmother crawling up their leg with a knife in her teeth. But no one should be asked to handle this trip.","Months later, when I rarely saw the Angels, I still had the legacy of the big machine -- four hundred pounds of chrome and deep red noise to take out on the Coast Highway and cut loose at three in the morning, when all the cops were lurking over on 101. My first crash had wrecked the bike completely and it took several months to have it rebuilt. After that I decided to ride it differently: I would stop pushing my luck on curves, always wear a helmet and try to keep within range of the nearest speed limit ... my insurance had already been canceled and my driver\'s license was hanging by a thread.So it was always at night, like a werewolf, that I would take the thing out for an honest run down the coast. I would start in Golden Gate Park, thinking only to run a few long curves to clear my head ... but in a matter of minutes I\'d be out at the beach with the sound of the engine in my ears, the surf booming up on the sea wall and a fine empty road stretching all the way down to Santa Cruz ... not even a gas station in the whole seventy miles; the only public light along the way is an all-night diner down around Rockaway Beach.There was no helmet on those nights, no speed limit, and no cooling it down on the curves. The momentary freedom of the park was like the one unlucky drink that shoves a wavering alcoholic off the wagon. I would come out of the park near the soccer field and pause for a moment at the stop sign, wondering if I knew anyone parked out there on the midnight humping strip.","ROSS PEROT was the best thing that happened in American politics since Richard Nixon acquired a taste for gin. In both cases, the political dialogue of the day was enriched by spontaneous gibberish that entertained the wrong people and made the right ones question their faith.","Can I get to the bottle of Old Crow and mix it up with the remains of these ice fragments...a cool drink for the freak? Give the gentleman something cool, dear, can\'t you see he\'s wired his brain to the water pump and his ears to the generator...","NOT EVERYBODY is comfortable with the idea that politics is a guilty addiction.

This was one of the theories I\'d been nursing all the way from San Francisco. Unlike Porterville or Hollister, Bass Lake was a mountain community ... and if the old Appalachian pattern held, the people would be much slower to anger or panic, but absolutely without reason or mercy once the fat was in the fire. Like the Angels, they would tend to fall back in an emergency on their own native sense of justice -- which bears only a primitive resemblance to anything written in law books. I thought the mountain types would be far more tolerant of the Angels\' noisy showboating, but -- compared to their flatlands cousins -- much quicker to retaliate in kind at the first evidence of physical insult or abuse.","Nixon stabbed his Enemies in the back, but Clinton did it to his Friends. His lust to inflict Punishment surpassed even Nixon\u2019s, and he put more people in prison than Caligula. He had his own brother locked up & he refused to pardon his old friend Webb Hubbell.\u2026 Richard Nixon was a criminally insane Monster; Bill Clinton is a black-hearted Swine of a friend.","For several months they\'d been drifting toward political involvement, but the picture was hazy and one of the most confusing elements was their geographical proximity to Berkeley, the citadel of West Coast radicalism. Berkeley is right next door to Oakland, with nothing between them but a line on the map and a few street signs, but in many ways they are as different as Manhattan and the Bronx. Berkeley is a college town and, like Manhattan, a magnet for intellectual transients. Oakland is a magnet for people who want hour-wage jobs and cheap housing, who can\'t afford to live in Berkeley, San Francisco or any of the middle-class Bay Area suburbs. [10] It is a noisy, ugly, mean-spirited place, with the sort of charm that Chicago had for Sandburg. It is also a natural environment for hoodlums, brawlers, teenage gangs and racial tensions.The Hell\'s Angels\' massive publicity -- coming hard on the heels of the widely publicized student rebellion in Berkeley -- was interpreted in liberal-radical-intellectual circles as the signal for a natural alliance. Beyond that, the Angels\' aggressive, antisocial stance -- their alienation, as it were -- had a tremendous appeal for the more aesthetic Berkeley temperament. Students who could barely get up the nerve to sign a petition or to shoplift a candy bar were fascinated by tales of the Hell\'s Angels ripping up towns and taking whatever they wanted. Most important, the Angels had a reputation for defying police, for successfully bucking authority, and to the frustrated student radical this was a powerful image indeed. The Angels didn\'t masturbate, they raped. They didn\'t come on with theories and songs and quotations, but with noise and muscle and sheer balls.","Oral Roberts is a greed-crazed white-trash lunatic who should have been hung upside down from a telephone pole on the outskirts of Tulsa 44 years ago, before he somehow transmogrified into the money-sucking animal that he became when he discovered television.","A week earlier I\'d been locked into the idea that the Redskins would win easily -- but when Nixon came out for them and George Allen began televising his prayer meetings I decided that any team with both God and Nixon on their side was fucked from start.","He chuckled. \u201cAll I can see is that goddamn necklace.

Richard Nixon comes quickly to mind, along with Ronald Reagan and his ridiculous \u201ctrickle-down\u201d theory of U.S. economic policy. If the Rich get Richer, the theory goes, before long their pots will overflow and somehow \u201ctrickle down\u201d to the poor, who would rather eat scraps off the Bush family plates than eat nothing at all.

Foremost among them was the suspicion that my strange and ungovernable instincts might do me in before I had a chance to get rich. No matter how much I wanted all those things that I needed money to buy, there was some devilish current pushing me off in another direction\u2014toward anarchy and poverty and craziness. That maddening delusion that a man can lead a decent life without hiring himself out as a Judas Goat.","From the very beginning Ihad felt a definite contact with Yeamon, a kind of tenuous understanding that talk is cheap in this league and that a man who knew what he was after had damn little time to find it, much less to sit back and explain himself.","A year or so earlier I had been to the Sky River Rock Festival in rural Washington, where a dosen stone-broke freaks from Seattle Liberation Front had assembled a sound system that carried every small note of an acoustic guitar - even a cough or the sound of a boot drooping on the stage - to half-deaf acid victims huddled under bushes a half mile away.But the best technicians available to the National DAs\' convention in Vegas apparently couldn\'t handle it. Their sound system looked like something Ulysses S. Grant might have triggered up to addres his troops during the Siege of Vicksburg. The voices from up front crackled with a fuzzy, high-pitched urgency, and the delay was just enough to keep the words disconcertingly out of phaze with the speaker\'s gestures. (Fear and Loathing in Las Vegas, p. 73)","In the terms of our Great Society the Hell\'s Angels and their ilk are losers -- dropouts, failures and malcontents. They are rejects looking for a way to get even with a world in which they are only a problem.The Hell\'s Angels are not visionaries, but diehards, and if they are the forerunners or the vanguard of anything it is not the \\"moral revolution\\" in vogue on college campuses, but a fast-growing legion of young unemployables whose untapped energy will inevitably find the same kind of destructive outlet that \\"outlaws\\" like the Hell\'s Angels have been finding for years.","About five miles back I had a brush with the CHP. Not stopped or pulled over: nothing routine. I always drive properly. A bit fast, perhaps, but always with consummate skill and a natural feel for the road that even cops recognize. No cop was ever born who isn\'t a sucker for a finely-executed hi-speed Controlled Drift all the way around one of those cloverleaf freeway interchanges.Few people understand the psychology of dealing with a highway traffic cop. Your normal speeder will panic and immediately pull over to the side when he sees the big red light behind him ... and then he will start apologizing, begging for mercy.This is wrong. It arouses contempt in the cop-heart. The thing to do \u2013 when you\'re running along about 100 or so and you suddenly find a red-flashing CHP-tracker on your tail \u2013 what you want to do then is accelerate. Never pull over with the first siren-howl. Mash it down and make the bastard chase you at speeds up to 120 all the way to the next exit. He will follow. But he won\'t know what to make of your blinker-signal that says you\'re about to turn right.This is to let him know you\'re looking for a proper place to pull off and talk ... keep signaling and hope for an off-ramp, one of those uphill side-loops with a sign saying \\"Max Speed 25\\" ... and the trick, at this point, is to suddenly leave the freeway and take him into the chute at no less than 100 miles an hour.He will lock his brakes about the same time you lock yours, but it will take him a moment to realize that he\'s about to make a 180-degree turn at this speed ... but you will be ready for it, braced for the Gs and the fast heel-toe work, and with any luck at all you will have come to a complete stop off the road at the top of the turn and be standing beside your automobile by the time he catches up.He will not be reasonable at first ... but no matter. Let him calm down. He will want the first word. Let him have it. His brain will be in a turmoil: he may begin jabbering, or even pull his gun. Let him unwind; keep smiling. The idea is to show him that you were always in total control of yourself and your vehicle \u2013 while he lost control of everything.","When I arrived the News was three years old and Ed Lotterman was on the verge of a breakdown. To hear him talk you would think he\'d been sitting at the very cross-corners of the earth, seeing himself as a combination of God, Pulitzer and the Salvation Army. He often swore that if all the people who had worked for the paper in those years could appear at one time before the throne of The Almighty--if they all stood there and recited their histories and their quirks and their crimes and their deviations--there was no doubt in his mind that God himself would fall down in a swoon and tear his hair.","They command a fascination, however reluctant, that borders on psychic masturbation.","Those were the good mornings, when the sun was hot and the air was quick and promising, when the Real Business seemed right on the verge of happening and I felt that if I went just a little faster I might overtake that bright and fleeting thing that was always just ahead.","Say,\' I said. \\"What brings you out here at this hour of the morning, for a thing like this?\\"\'The bus,\' he said.","For an instant it was very peaceful\xa0\u2026\xa0and then it was like being shot off the road by a bazooka, but with no noise.

There was little optimism about what might happen when the Angels\u2014worshiping violence, rape and swastikas\u2014found themselves in a crowd of intellectual hipsters, Marxist radicals and pacifist peace marchers. It was a nervous thing to consider even if everybody could be expected to keep a straight head\xa0\u2026\xa0but of course that was out of the question. With everyone drunk, stoned and loaded, there was nobody capable of taking objective notes, no guides to soothe the flip-outs, no rational spectator to put out fires or hid the butcher knives\xa0\u2026\xa0no control at all.","I\'ve never given much thought to grants but now that LeRoi Jones has a Guggenheim I have to consider the possibility of a new era, for good or ill. So if you\'re sitting down there on a bundle of loose cash I\'d appreciate any and all advice as to how I might lay my hands on some of it.- in a letter to Richard Scowcroft dated 5/13/1965","Hungry people have the cunning of wild beasts.","Yesterday\'s weirdness is tomorrow\'s reason why","I was so far beyond simple fatigue that I was beginning to feel nicely adjusted to the idea of permanent hysteria.","To crank up a noisy bad stance out in a place like San Francisco and start yelling about \u201cgetting things done in Washington is like sitting far back in the end zone seats at the Super Bowl and screaming at the Miami linebackers \u201cStop Duane Thomas!\u201d","I haven\'t found a drug yet that can get you anywhere near as high as sitting at a desk writing.","All those pathetically eager acid freaks who thought they could buy Peace and Understanding for three bucks a hit.

It seems like a lifetime, or at least a Main Era - the kind of peak that never comes again. San Francisco in the middle sixties was a very special time and place to be a part of. Maybe it meant something. Maybe not, in the long run . . . but no explanation, no mix of words or music or memories can touch that sense of knowing that you were here and alive in that corner of time and the world. Whatever it meant . . . .(...)There was a fantastic universal sense that whatever we were doing was right, that we were winning. And that, I think, was the handle - that sense of inevitable victory over the forces of Old and Evil. Not in any mean or military sense; we didn\u2019t need that. Our energy would simply prevail. There was no point in fighting - on our side or theirs. We had all the momentum; we were riding the crest of a high and beautiful wave.So now, less than five years later, you can go up on a steep hill in Las Vegas and look West, and with the right kind of eyes you can almost see the high - water mark - that place where the wave finally broke and rolled back.","Don\u2019t say that, I snapped. \u201cWe are innocent men!

Five years later? Six? It seems like a lifetime, or at least a Main Era - the kind of peak that never comes again. San Francisco in the middle sixties was a very special time and place to be a part of. Maybe it meant something. Maybe not, in the long run . . . but no explanation, no mix of words or music or memories can touch that sense of knowing that you were here and alive in that corner of time and the world. Whatever it meant . . . .History is hard to know, because of all the hired bullshit, but even without being sure of \u201chistory it seems entirely reasonable to think that every now and then the energy of a whole generation comes to a head in a long fine flash, for reasons that nobody really understands at the time - andwhich never explain, in retrospect, what actually happened. My central memory of that time seems to hang on one or five or maybe forty nights - or very early mornings - when I left the Fillmore half - crazy and, instead of going home, aimed the big 650 Lightning across the Bay Bridge at a hundred miles an hour wearing L. L. Bean shorts and a Butte sheepherder\u2019s jacket . . . booming through the Treasure Island tunnel at the lights of Oakland and Berkeley and Richmond, not quite sure which turn - off to take when I got to the other end (always stalling at the toll - gate, too twisted to find neutral while I fumbled for change) . . . but being absolutely certain that no matter which way I went I would come to a place where people were just as high and wild as Iwas: No doubt at all about that. There was madness in any direction, at any hour. If not across the Bay, then up the Golden Gate or down 101 to Los Altos or La Honda. . . . You could strike sparks anywhere.There was a fantastic universal sense that whatever we were doing was right, that we were winning. And that, I think, was the handle - that sense of inevitable victory over the forces of Old and Evil. Not in any mean or military sense; we didn\u2019t need that. Our energy would simply prevail. There was no point in fighting - on our side or theirs. We had all the momentum; we were riding the crest of a high and beautiful wave.So now, less than five years later, you can go up on a steep hill in Las Vegas and look West, and with the right kind of eyes you can almost see the high - water mark - that place where the wave finally broke and rolled back.\u201d","The power of the presidency is so vast that is probably a good thing, in retrospect, that only a few people in this country understood the gravity of Richard Nixon\'s mental condition during his last year in the White House. There were moments in that year when even his closest friends and advisers were convinced that the President of the United States was so crazy with rage and booze and suicidal despair that he was only two martinis away from losing his grip entirely and suddenly locking himself in his office long enough to make that single telephone call that would have launched enough missiles and bombers to blow the whole world off its axis or at least kill 100 million people.","So there is more to their stance than a wistful yearning for acceptance in a world they never made. Their real motivation is an instinctive certainty as to what the score really is. They are out of the ballgame and they know it. Unlike the campus rebels, who with a minimum amount of effort will emerge from their struggle with a validated ticket to status, the outlaw motorcyclist views the future with the baleful eye of a man with no upward mobility at all. In a world increasingly geared to specialists, technicians and fantastically complicated machinery, the Hell\u2019s Angels are obvious losers and it bugs them. But instead of submitting quietly to their collective fate, they have made it the basis of a full-time social vendetta. They don\u2019t expect to win anything, but on the other hand, they have nothing to lose.
