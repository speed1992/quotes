Tomorrow they will be grateful! This is especially true if they were told that there were an outside threat from beyond, whether real or promulgated, that threatened our very existence. It is then that all peoples of the world will plead to deliver them from this evil. The one thing every man fears is the unknown. When presented with this scenario, individual rights will be willingly relinquished for the guarantee of their well-being granted to them by the World Government","Depopulation should be the highest priority of foreign policy towards the third world, because the US economy will require large and increasing amounts of minerals from abroad, especially from less developed countries","It is not a matter of what is true that counts, but a matter of what is perceived to be true.","The one thing man fears is the unknown. When presented with this scenario, individual rights will be willingly relinquished for the guarantee of their well-being granted to them by a World Government, a New World Order.","The elderly are useless eaters.","World population needs to be decreased by 50%","Military men are just dumb, stupid animals to be used as pawns in foreign policy.","[The New World Order] cannot happen without U.S. participation, as we are the most significant single component. Yes, there will be a New World Order, and it will force the United States to change it\'s perceptions.","Democracy is too important to leave up to the votes of the people.","Control oil and you control nations; control food and you control the people.","The illegal we do immediately. The unconstitutional takes a little longer.","To be an enemy of America can be dangerous, but to be a friend is fatal","Accept everything about yourself - I mean everything, You are you and that is the beginning and the end - no apologies, no regrets.","America has no permanent friends or enemies, only interests.","An expert is someone who articulates the needs of those in power.","I can think of no faster way to unite the American people behind George W. Bush than a terrorist attack on an American target overseas. And I believe George W. Bush will quickly unite the American people through his foreign policy.","Before the Freedom of Information Act, I used to say at meetings \\"The illegal we do immediately. The unconstitutional takes a little longer.\\" [...] But since the Freedom of Information Act, I\'m afraid to say things like that.","NAFTA represents the single most creative step towards a New World Order.","Would food be considered an instrument of national power? ... Is the U.S. prepared to accept food rationing to help people who can\'t/won\'t control their population growth?","In 10 years, there will be no more Israel.","If you do not know where you are going, every road will get you nowhere","The enemies you make by taking a decided stand generally have more respect for you than the friends you make by being on the fence","Oil is much too important a commodity to be left in the hands of the Arabs.","What we in America call terrorists are really groups of people that reject the international system","How to Achieve The New World Order","Power is the ultimate aphrodisiac.","The issues are too important to be left for the voters.","No one will ever win the battle of the sexes; there\'s too much fraternizing with the enemy.","The absence of alternatives clears the mind marvelously.","Each success only buys an admission ticket to a more difficult problem.","Donald Rumsfeld is the most ruthless man I have ever met? and I mean that as a compliment.","In the end, peace can be achieved only by hegemony or by balance of power.","If you control the food, you control a nation. If you control the energy, you control a region. If you control the money, you control the world.","Americans believe that you can alter people by conversion, and that everybody in the world is a potential American. The Chinese also believe that their values are universal, but they do not believe that you can convert to becoming a Chinese unless you are born into it.","A diamond is a chunk of coal that is made good under pressure.","The nice thing about being a celebrity is that, if you bore people, they think it\'s their fault.","A leader does not deserve the name unless he is willing occasionally to stand alone.","China is a country with a record of continuous self-government going back 4,000 years, the only society that has achieved this. One must start with the assumption that they must have learnt something about the requirements for survival, and it is not always to be assumed that we know it better than they do.","In his essay, \u2018Perpetual Peace,\u2019 the philosopher, Immanuel Kant, argued that perpetual peace would eventually come to the world in one of two ways, by human insight or by conflicts and catastrophes of a magnitude that left humanity no other choice. We are at such a juncture.","U.S. policy toward the third world should be one of depopulation","There cannot be a crisis next week. My schedule is already full.","The conventional army loses if it does not win. The guerrilla wins if he does not lose.","I don\'t stand on protocol. Just call me your Excellency.","It is one of history\'s ironies that Communism, advertised as a classless society, tended to breed a privileged class of feudal proportions.","Diplomacy: the art of restraining power.","Let us fashion together a new world order.","No foreign policy - no matter how ingenious - has any chance of success if it is born in the minds of a few and carried in the hearts of none.","The task of the leader is to get his people from where they are to where they have not been. The public does not fully understand the world into which it is going. Leaders must invoke an alchemy of great vision. Those leaders who do not are ultimately judged failures, even though they may be popular at the moment.","In crises the most daring course is often safest.","While we should never give up our principles, we must also realize that we cannot maintain our principles unless we survive.","The test of policy is how it ends, not how it begins. Foreign policy is the art of establishing priorities. Demonization is not a policy; it is an alibi for the absence of one. The test is not absolute satisfaction but balanced dissatisfaction.","The US must carry out some act somewhere in the world which shows its determination to continue to be a world power.","Superstars strive for approbation; heroes walk alone. Superstars crave consensus; heroes define themselves by the judgment of a future they see it as their task to bring about. Superstars seek success in a technique for eliciting support; heroes pursue success as the outgrowth of inner values.","An Iranian moderate is one who has run out of ammunition.","For any student of history, change is the law of life. Any attempt to contain it guarantees an explosion down the road; the more rigid the adherence to the status quo, the more violent the ultimate outcome will be.","If it\'s going to come out eventually, better have it come out immediately.","If eighty percent of your sales come from twenty percent of all of your items, just carry those twenty percent.","You can\'t make war in the Middle East without Egypt and you can\'t make peace without Syria.","People think responsibility is hard to bear. It\'s not. I think that sometimes it is the absence of responsibility that is harder to bear. You have a great feeling of impotence.","The Western concept of democracy is based on the idea that the loser of an election has the possibility next time round of being the winner. But in the case of an ethnically or religiously divided country, in which minorities don\'t live peacefully together, this necessary balance can\'t be properly guaranteed by democracy. When each ethnic group arms itself, it is not surprising that the army of a new state is viewed by part of the population as an ideological militia.","Nothing is more urgent than a serious, dare I say compassionate, debate as to where we are going at home and abroad. Technicians cannot master revolutions; every great achievement was an idea before it became a reality. Cathedrals cannot be built by those who are paralyzed by doubt or consumed by cynicism. If a society loses the capacity for great conception, it can be administered but not governed.","The superpowers often behave like two heavily armed blind men feeling their way around a room, each believing himself in mortal peril from the other, whom he assumes to have perfect vision. Each side should know that frequently uncertainty, compromise, and incoherence are the essence of policymaking. Yet each tends to ascribe to the other a consistency, foresight, and coherence that its own experience belies. Of course, over time, even two armed blind men can do enormous damage to each other, not to speak of the room.","Clearly security without values is like a ship without a rudder. But values without security are like a rudder without a ship.","For the West, the demonization of Vladimir Putin is not a policy; it is an alibi for the absence of one. Putin is a serious strategist \u2013 on the premises of Russian history. Understanding US values and psychology are not his strong suits. Nor has understanding Russian history and psychology been a strong point among US policymakers.\u2019","High office teaches decision making, not substance. It consumes intellectual capital; it does not create it. Most high officials leave office with the perceptions and insights with which they entered; they learn how to make decisions but not what decisions to make.","Does anyone have any questions for my answers?","Committees are consumers and sometimes sterilizers of ideas, rarely creators of them.","Every civilization that has ever existed has ultimately collapsed.","Every civilization that has ever existed has ultimately collapsed. History is a tale of efforts that failed, or aspirations that weren\u2019t realized. So, as a historian, one has to live with a sense of the inevitability of tragedy.","Leaders are responsible not for running public opinion polls but for the consequences of their actions.","It is, after all, the responsibility of the expert to operate the familiar and that of the leader to transcend it.","For other nations, utopia is a blessed past never to be recovered; for Americans it is just beyond the horizon.","Donald Trump is a phenomenon that foreign countries haven\'t seen.","Statesman create; ordinary leaders consume. The ordinary leader is satisfied with ameliorating the environment, not transforming it; a statesman must be a visionary and an educator.","Covert action should not be confused with missionary work.","There are some people who think that at some time in the future, China may challenge us for supremacy in the Pacific, and therefore, what do we do today to prevent that? And you, of course, will say that we will try to thwart any economic progress in China. If we engaged in such a policy, we would turn a billion-plus people into nationalist opponents of the United States.","The Israelis want security. The Arabs want dignity. And they consider the demands of each other as incompatible.","The superpowers often behave like two heavily armed blind men feeling their way around a room, each believing himself in mortal peril from the other, whom he assumes to have perfect vision.","Don\'t be too ambitious. Do the most important thing you can think of doing every year and then your career will take care of itself.","Ninety percent of the politicians give the other ten percent a bad reputation.","Countries do not assume burdens because it is fair, only because it is necessary.","It is barely conceivable that there are people who like war.","You become a superpower by being strong but also by being wise and by being farsighted. But no state is strong or wise enough to create a world order alone.","I grew up in Germany during the Nazi period, and I came to this country when I was 15. And then I had to work in a factory because we had no resources. And I went to night school. So, it was not a rational ambition for me to become a world statesman.","Every success is usually an admission ticket to a new set of decisions.","Leaders must invoke an alchemy of great vision.","University politics are vicious precisely because the stakes are so small.","The emergence of a unified Europe is one of the most revolutionary events of our time.","History is not, of course, a cookbook offering pretested recipes. It teaches by analogy, not by maxims. It can illuminate the consequences of actions in comparable situations, yet each generation must discover for itself what situations are in fact comparable.","We cannot give Russia veto over deployment of forces on NATO territory. But we have to understand their particular sensitivities, and, therefore, there should be a dialogue on these issues.","Intellectuals are cynical and cynics have never built a cathedral.","You should not go to war for the privilege of withdrawal. You need to define your objective and the outcome, and it cannot be the removal of one man.","I\'ve often said that the desire to lecture China on how it should behave in the world is wrong. China was around for thousands of years even before America existed. It could even be that China\'s growing power will allow itself to be slowed down. But as long as this immense empire doesn\'t fall apart, it will become an important factor in global politics.","In a diplomatic negotiation, you always meet the same the other side all the time. Even if you should succeed in outsmarting him or in pressuring him, it only sets up a cycle in which he will try to get even.","No country can act wisely simultaneously in every part of the globe at every moment of time.","Whatever must happen ultimately should happen immediately.","The art of good foreign policy is to understand and to take into consideration the values of a society, to realize them at the outer limit of the possible.","Even a paranoid can have enemies.","I don\'t see why we need to stand by and watch a country go communist due to the irresponsibility of its own people.","I believe that there is a whole set of issues in the world - environment, proliferation, energy, cyberspace - that can only be dealt with on a global basis. The traditional patterns of national rivalry and national competition are not suitable for those cases.","A bluff taken seriously is more useful than a serious threat interpreted as a bluff.","Intelligence is not all that important in the exercise of power, and is often, in point of fact, useless.","If we do what is necessary, all the odds are in our favor.","The task of the leader is to get his people from where they are to where they have not been.","Art is man\'s expression of his joy in labor.","The real distinction is between those who adapt their purposes to reality and those who seek to mold reality in the light of their purposes.","90% of politicians give the other 10% a bad name.","If peace is equated simply with the absence of war, it can become abject pacifism that turns the world over to the most ruthless.","To have striven so hard, to have molded a public personality out of so amorphous an identity, to have sustained that superhuman effort only to end with every weakness disclosed and every error compounding the downfall--that was a fate of biblical proportions. Evidently the Deity would not tolerate the presumption that all can be manipulated; an object lesson of the limits of human presumption was necessary.","I believe it is a mistake to isolate arms control from other areas of policy.","The history of things that didn\'t happen has never been written.","I think that his [Obama\'s] task will be to develop an overall strategy for America in this period, when really a New World Order can be created.","The British capitalize on their accent when they don\'t want you to know what they\'re saying. But if you wake them up at 4 A.M., they speak perfect English, the same as we do.","In my life, I have almost always been on the side of active foreign policy. But you need to know with whom you are cooperating. You need reliable partners.","This is awful. Do it again.","The greatest need of the contemporary international system is an agreed concept of order.","Access to natural resources can become a question of survival for many states.","Behind the slogans lay an intellectual vacuum.","A leader who confines his role to his people\'s experience dooms himself to stagnation; a leader who outstrips his people\'s experience runs the risk of not being understood.","University politics make me long for the simplicity of the Middle East.","The key decision for a statesman is whether to commit his nation or not. There is no middle course. Once a great nation commits itself, it must prevail. It will acquire no kudos for translating its inner doubts into hesitation.","I grew up as a discriminated minority in a dictatorship, so obviously the issue of human rights is a matter of concern for me.","Create the impression of endless willingness to compromise and you almost invite deadlines. That\'s the challenge we now have in North Korea and have had in North Korea for 10 years. In this sense, diplomacy and foreign policy and other elements of political activity have to be closely linked and have to be understood by the negotiators","The Chinese military budget today is officially listed as, I think, about $15 billion. But even if you double it, that\'s only a tenth of ours. So the possibility of China challenging the United States for the next ten years over the Pacific is next to zero. There could be a conflict between us and China over Taiwan, but I think that, too, will not occur with the proper policies on both sides.","It is frankly a mistake of amateurs to believe you can gain the upper hand in a diplomatic negotiation.","If you mean by \\"military victory\\" an Iraqi government that can be established and whose writ runs across the whole country, that gets the civil war under control and sectarian violence under control in a time period that the political processes of the democracies will support, I don\'t believe that is possible.","There are only two reasons to sit in the back row of an airplane: Either you have diarrhea, or you\'re anxious to meet people who do.","John Paul II was one of the greatest men of the last century. Perhaps the greatest.","I know Hillary Clinton as a person. And as a personal friend, I would say yes, she\'d be a good president. But she\'d put me under a great conflict of interest if she were a candidate because I intend to support the Republicans.","I want to thank you for stopping the applause. It is impossible for me to look humble for any period of time.","Well, the capacity of French intellectuals to understand a Texan way of thinking is finite.","It is not often that nations learn from the past,even rarer that they draw the correct conclusions from it.","One of the hardest things for the president is to distinguish the routine issues that come through from the essential issues that affect the long term, and not to let himself get sucked into the battles of the bureaucracy for marginal issues, and to keep them focused and to keep his mind clear on what the fundamental things are that he has to accomplish.","In the current [Carter] administration, who can use the White House swimming pool and tennis courts is decided at the very highest level. President Ford did not bother himself with such minor details. He let me swim in the pool. He only got upset when I tried to walk across the water.","The reason prophets are so rarely honored in their own country is that their role is to transcend the limits of their contemporaries\' experience and imagination. They achieve recognition only when their vision has been turned into experience - in short, when it is too late to benefit from their foresight.","A little uncertainty is good for everyone.","Power is the great aphrodisiac.","In the short term, it would not have made it possible to resume relations, because in the Chinese mind, the humiliation of China started with the annexation of Taiwan by Japan. If the United States had suddenly declared Taiwan as a separate state - for which we would have had no support among other nations - the consequences would have been giving up our relationship with China and committing ourselves to a long-term conflict with China.","Well it did not make excessive sense to say that 20 million people are the recognized government of a billion people that have their own institutions. We did not change it in the sense that we said this has to end, but there was a U.N. vote that transferred the legitimacy of China from Taiwan to Beijing. Beijing was recognized as the government of all of China. Then, under President Carter, we followed what the U.N. had already done eight years earlier.","Administration has managed the extraordinary feat of having, at one and the same time, the worst relations with our allies, the worst relations with our adversaries, and the most serious upheavals in the developing world since the end of the Second World War.","The true conservative is not at home in social struggle. He will attempt to avoid unbridgeable schism, because he knows that a stable social structure thrives not on triumphs but on reconciliations.","There is no realism without an element of idealism.","I am against portraying China as the demon of the global community. China has grasped more quickly than other countries what globalization means and what it demands. The country has learned how to use other people\'s innovations for itself. India, incidentally, is not far behind China in this respect. Both are not nations in the European sense, but rather cultural communities with enormous markets. The challenge of the future is to work out how to deal with that.","When I first saw China, there were no automobiles. There were no supermarkets. There were no high-rise buildings. There were no consumer goods. There were no restaurants that were at least accessible that foreigners could see. It was a Stalinist society, and a very poor Stalinist society. So the economic system has totally changed, and the private sector in the economic system is now the dominant sector. It didn\'t exist at all as late as 1979.","The China of the 1970s was a communist dictatorship. The China of the twenty-first century is a one-party state without a firm ideological foundation, more similar to Mexico under the PRI than Russia under Stalin. But the measurement of the political and the economic evolution has not yet been completed, and is one of the weak points of the system.","Now when I bore people at a party they think it\'s their fault.","The security of Israel is a moral imperative for all free peoples.","It is an act of insanity and national humiliation to have a law prohibiting the President from ordering assassination.","The longer I am out of office, the more infallible I appear to myself.","A country that demands moral perfection in its foreign policy will achieve neither perfection nor security.","China had never had to deal in a world of countries of approximately equal strength, and so to adjust to such a world, is in itself a profound challenge to China, which now has fourteen countries on its borders, some of which are small, but can project their nationality into China, some of which are large, and historically significant, so that any attempt by Chinese to dominate the world, would involve in a disastrous for the peace of the world.","Revolutionaries are rarely motivated primarily by material considerations-though the illusion that they are persists in the West.","We fought a military war; our opponents fought a political one. We sought physical attrition; our opponents aimed for our psychological exhaustion. In the process we lost sight of one of the cardinal maxims of guerrilla war: the guerrilla wins if he does not lose. The conventional army loses if it does not win. The North Vietnamese used their armed forces the way a bull-fighter uses his cape to keep us lunging in areas of marginal political importance.","Becoming conscious is of course a sacrilege against nature; it is as though you had robbed the unconscious of something. The nice thing about being a celebrity is that if you bore people they think it\'s their fault.","We must learn to distinguish morality from moralizing.","Moderation is a virtue only in those who are thought to have an alternative.","If you control the oil you control the country; if you control food, you control the population.","Obama is like a chess player who is playing simultaneous chess and has opened his game with an unusual opening.","It was a Greek tragedy. Nixon was fulfilling his own nature. Once it started it could not end otherwise.","Any fact that needs to be disclosed should be put out now or as quickly as possible, because otherwise the bleeding will not end.","The convictions that leaders have formed before reaching high office are the intellectual capital they will consume as long as they continue in office.","Of course, in principle, they\'re against it. We are the ones that keep asking them what they think about it. I think their basic concern is a land-based missile defense of Taiwan hooked into the American communications and other systems, which in effect would make Taiwan then an outpost of the United States. That is a concern they frequently express. A missile defense shield of the United States, while they may not like it, it is not a big obstacle to our relationship.","In Asia, the nation state still is extremely vital, and of course, then in Africa, a whole new pattern is emerging because the states in Africa reflected the preferences of the colonial powers when they were established.","I don\'t think that that\'s a desirable option for us. Besides, it wouldn\'t work, because there are too many other countries that are willing to work economically with China. But I don\'t think the basic relationship depends on economics. It depends on a political understanding of what is required for peace in Asia.","China is a one party state. Sooner or later China will get to the point when the new social classes, which have emerged thanks to economic success, will have to be integrated into the political system. There is no guarantee that this process will run smoothly.","I don\'t think we should pay people to fight terrorism. I would be amazed if they asked for anything in return.","The challenge is whether China as a rising country, the United States as the superpower, can develop a cooperative relationship in this period before nationalism becomes so dominant in China as a substitute for communism, and a kind of self-righteous isolationism in this country that substitutes China for the Soviet Union.","Peace depends ultimately not on political arrangements but on the conscience of mankind.","Baseball is the most intellectual game because most of the action goes on in your head.","Every time there has been an attempt to disturb it, it led to two things. It led to immediate intense conflict with China, and it led to a reaffirmation in the end, because nobody wanted a major confrontation with China to this principle of a \\"one China\\" policy within which Taiwan is finding a place now. Its own position has greatly improved since the Nixon policy. It is richer, it is stronger and it is participating in many international organizations.","What China would do, I cannot predict. China has all but given up the claim to the use of force, except in the circumstance of Taiwan declaring its independence. That is a huge step forward over what the situation was many years ago.","When I became security advisor, I became familiar with the so-called SIOP war plans, I called in Secretary McNamara and asked him what they were hiding from me, because I couldn\'t believe that the National policy would foresee such a level of destructiveness.","I also do not believe that the United States can let itself be driven into a political role by escalating terrorism, and therefore, the leaders of the Arab world and Arafat should do their utmost to put an end to this and then the United States should do its utmost to produce a political solution.","Most foreign policies that history has marked highly, in whatever country, have been originated by leaders who were opposed by experts.","Far too often the Ukrainian issue is posed as a showdown: whether Ukraine joins the East or the West. But if Ukraine is to survive and thrive, it must not be either side\'s outpost against the other - it should function as a bridge between them.","I do not know what will happen in China politically. I do know that it is impossible to maintain the communist system or probably even a strict one-party system when the economy becomes so pluralistic. Now, what form that takes and what institutions will evolve, I do not have a clear view about. I do not think the United States, as a general principle, ought to intervene in this.","People are now starting to explain the Cold War. Even in the crises at that time the survival of millions of people was at stake. And we (the USA) had to threaten the other super power with retaliation to prevent it from doing something to us. Today we live in a world in which a lot of things are in flux. That creates a lot of fear. But it is also a time of great opportunity. And I would call on today\'s statesmen to not allow their thinking to be directed by fear.","We cannot always assure the future of our friends; we have a better chance of assuring our future if we remember who our friends are.","We have to be careful in negotiating with Iran that we don\'t create the impression among the Arab states and the Sunni states that we are working on a condominium between Iran and the United States, because that will panic them and drive them into making their own arrangement.","We\'re at a moment when the international system is in a period of change like we haven\'t seen for several hundred years. In some parts of the world, the nation state, on which the existing international system was based, is either giving up its traditional aspects, like in Europe, or as in the Middle East, where it was never really fully established, it is no longer the defining element. So in those two parts of the world, there is tremendous adjustment in traditional concepts.","Nixon had three goals: to win by the biggest electoral landslide in history; to be remembered as a peacemaker; and to be accepted by the \'Establishment\' as an equal. He achieved all these objectives at the end of 1972 and the beginning of 1973. And he lost them all two months later-partly because he turned a dream into an obsession.","In my particular case foreign policy happens to be my hobby, my consuming interest. I had spent decades studying it.","China has had a long and complex history and has managed to evolve its own culture for 4,000 years. It therefore not necessarily true that we know exactly what is best for the internal structure of China.","The essence of Richard Nixon is loneliness.","I don\'t read books, I write them.","Even paranoid people have enemies.","People are generally amazed that I would take an interest in any form that would require me to stop talking for three hours.","What political leaders decide, intelligence services tend to seek to justify.","I do not criticize people who take a public stand on human rights issues. I express my respect for them. But some people are more influential without a public confrontation.","We attempted to try to solve every problem in the world, out of a sense of moral obligations, and attitudes, and our history. But no country can solve every problem without exhausting itself. Therefore, we have to establish priorities.","Deng Xiaoping thought of himself as a great revolutionary and a great reformer. He had dismantled the Chinese communist management of the economy. In my next-to-last conversation with him, which was about six months before Tiananmen Square, he said to me that his aim would be the next phase to reduce the Communist Party to philosophical issues. And I said, \\"What\'s a philosophical issue?\\" And he said, \\"Well, like if we make an alliance with Russia.\\" Given his view of Russia, that was not the likeliest thing that would ever happen.","A nation riven by factions, in which the minority has no hope of ever becoming a majority, or in which some group knows it is perpetually outcast, will seem oppressive to its members, whatever the legal pretensions.","The defining issue is that the government in Taiwan was considered to be the government of all of China, and the authorities in Beijing were not recognized as a government of China. So Taiwan was the residuary for all of China.","I don\'t know what happens in the next years. But I cannot now design a policy in which we try to keep China from developing, because in some years, if they develop, they might be rich enough to challenge us, and adopt the principle that we will hold down any state that might in the future become strong. That would make us a world empire for which we wouldn\'t have the talents or the convictions.","Jews were segregated from 1933 on. We could only play against other Jewish teams. This wasn\'t just social segregation; this was the beginning of the extermination of the Jews. That\'s why my family left Germany in 1938.","The attitude of the West and of Russia towards a crisis like Ukraine is diametrically different. The West is trying to establish the legality of any established border. For Russia, Ukraine is part of the Russian patrimony. A Russian state was created around Kiev about 1,200 years ago. Ukraine itself has been part of Russia for 500 years, and I would say most Russians consider it part of Russian patrimony. The ideal solution would be to have a Ukraine like Finland or Austria that can be a bridge between these two rather than an outpost.","The mistake we make with many people - not just Russia - is that we believe we have the model, and there is a sort of a condescension in our dialogue with other societies, which was especially painful in several administrations to Russia. I think in Russia, the Yeltsin period is not considered a period of great achievement, but a period of corruption and humiliation.","I have learned, as I wrote, that history must be discovered, not declared. It\'s an admission that one grows in life.","One theory is that we will make war look so attractive that we undermine the deterrent. That\'s Never Never Land. What we have now would have been enough to deter Hitler. But we are talking in a different order of reality.","Any international system must have two key elements for it to work. One, it has to have a certain equilibrium of power that makes overthrowing the system difficult and costly. Secondly, it has to have a sense of legitimacy.","It is steady, reliable, tough. It never yields to panic. It is never defeated one-sidedly. It achieves everything attainable by character and tenacity.","The statesman\'s duty is to bridge the gap between his nation\'s experience and his vision.","Almost every peace process that has gone on between the Arab side and Israel, the United States has been somewhat isolated because most of the countries in the world, what they really want is to accept the Arab peace plan or so-called peace plan, which in its present form would lead to the destruction of Israel.","One has to remember that every progress that has been made towards peace in the Middle East has come under American leadership.","Over time even two armed blind men in a room can do enormous damage to each other, not to speak of the room.","The Russian empire under czars and commissars has been hard to deal with for other countries.","In a nuclear war, even if one side were to come out ahead by systems analytical standards, both sides would be so weakened, that it would - they would be in the position of Europe after the two World Wars.","I would say the special experience of American wartime policy in the last 40 years, from Vietnam on, is that the war itself became controversial in the country and that the most important thing we need in the current situation is, whatever disagreements there may be on tactics, that the legitimacy of the war itself does not become a subject of controversy. We have to start with the assumption, obviously, that whatever administration is conducting a war wants to end it.","I have always expressed respect for those people who make public declarations.","With respect to the relationship between nuclear weapons and the advent of d\xe9tente, one has to consider two things. One, the nature of nuclear weapons in themselves, and secondly, the advent of nuclear parity.","In my view, there\'s no doubt that the Soviets had infinitely greater trouble holding their structure together than we did.","The important thing is to do the right thing. Then credibility will follow.","It is not often that nations learn from the past even rarer that they draw the correct conclusions from it. For the lessons of historical experience, as of personal experience, are contingent. They teach the consequences of certain actions, but they cannot force a recognition of comparable situations.","My country\'s history, Mr. President, tells us that it is possible to fashion unity while cherishing diversity, that common action is possible despite the variety of races, interests, and beliefs we see here in this chamber. Progress and peace and justice are attainable. So we say to all peoples and governments: Let us fashion together a new world order.","I knew Deng Xiaoping when he came out of prison. He had, after all, been imprisoned for nearly ten years by Mao. I know what China looked like before he took over, and so in my own mind, I don\'t think of Deng Xiaoping as an oppressor. I think of somebody who, faced with that crisis, made a very painful and decision with which I cannot agree. But I also think of him as a great reformer.","Where position is felt to be a birthright, generosity is possible (though not guaranteed); flexibility is not inhibited by a commitment to perpetual success.","They [American forces] are there as an expression of the American national interest to prevent the Iranian combination of imperialism and fundamentalist ideology from dominating a region on which the energy supplies of the industrial democracies depend.","I do not stand on protocol. If you just call me Excellency, it will be okay.","History knows no resting places and no plateaus","Our greatest foreign policy problem is our divisions at home. Our greatest foreign policy need is national cohesion and a return to the awareness that in foreign policy we are all engaged in a common national endeavor.","Withdrawal of US troops will become like salted peanuts to the American public: The more US troops come home, the more will be demanded.","I have been observing China for more than 30 years and am impressed how logically and wisely it tackles its problems. Obviously the international system could be unbalanced by China\'s rising power - if we don\'t prepare ourselves for the new competitive situation, that is. But it is an economic challenge, not aggression on the level of Hitler.","What is applicable is to understand that first of all China has undergone a huge revolution in the last years. Anyone who saw China as I did in 1971 - and for that matter even in 1979, because not much had changed between 1971 and 1979 - and sees China today, knows one is in a different economic system.","I have great respect for the Taiwanese. They have done an extraordinary job. But it was not a sustainable position to say that the legitimate government of China resides in Taiwan, which at that time didn\'t have much contact with the mainland.","Certainly nothing is easier than to rewrite history. If we had made Taiwan a separate state, it would have led to a fundamental conflict with China, and probably to war. Certainly in the long term, it would have led to war.","The nuclear weapons were not useful for the achievement of political objectives.","I had an opportunity to express my views, yes. I agreed with the approach which we took, namely, to make a distinction between the loss of life of the Chinese pilot and our military operations outside territorial waters or territorial limits.","We first became conscious of the plane publicly on a Monday. I thought then by the weekend it would be done. But then the Chinese military, the defense minister made a statement saying that if there was no apology from the United States, the Chinese military and the Chinese people would never understand. No reference to the government or the Communist Party, and that obviously presented an internal problem to the Chinese leadership, which was travelling at that moment.","I don\'t consider China a communist state, no. I know that sounds paradoxical, but it\'s my view.","The first reactions are often instinctive. So one of the first things we said was that the Chinese had no right to inspect the plane, and that we had a sovereign right to. I don\'t know what the legal position is, but it was surely psychologically absolutely the unwise thing to do.","Tutelage is a comfortable relationship for the senior partner, but it is demoralizing in the long run. It breeds illusions of omniscience on one side and attitudes of impotent irresponsibility on the other.","If the six-nation forums dealing with Iran and North Korea suffer comparable failures, the consequence will be a world of unchecked proliferation, not controlled by either governing principles or functioning institutions. A modern, strong, peaceful Iran could become a pillar of stability and progress in the region. This cannot happen unless Iran\'s leaders decide whether they are representing a cause or a nation - whether their basic motivation is crusading or international cooperation. The goal of the diplomacy of the Six should be to oblige Iran to confront this choice.","Realism in foreign policy is made up of a clear set of values, since difficult foreign policy decisions are often decided with the narrowest of majorities. Without any sense of what is right and wrong, one would drown in a flood of difficult and pragmatic decisions.","[Nixon] wants a massive bombing campaign in Cambodia. He doesn\'t want to hear anything about it. It\'s an order, to be done. Anything that flies on anything that moves.","Statesmen think in terms of history and view society as an organism. Prophets are different since they believe absolute aims can be achieved in the foreseeable future. More people have been killed by crusaders than by statesmen.","The capacity to admire others is not my most fully developed trait.","Realism in foreign policy means careful consideration of all aspects pertinent to the issue, before taking a decision. This is the only way you can move from where you are to someplace else.","History is the memory of States.","Well, I don\'t know whether it caused anguish in China, but it was not a wise way to proceed. But one has to remember that it was the first experience. And in a Republican administration, there is a conservative wing that looks at China as the last embodiment of communism, which therefore tends towards a more bellicose rhetoric anyway than I would. It\'s not the dominant element, but every once in a while they get a crack at public statement.","For the Soul of France is masterful history, brilliantly researched, and hard to put down.","Left to its own devices, the State Department machinery tends toward inertia rather than creativity; it is always on the verge of turning itself into an enormous cable machine.","I wouldn\'t say it\'s a split. It\'s a difference of emphasis. It does exist between, I would say, the State Department and the Defense Department.","We have three things in common: Irish wives, the ability to speak for 17 minutes without a verb, and the fact that we both speak with an accent.","Certainly not a party of the workers and the peasants. In fact, Jiang Zemin in recent weeks has officially said that capitalists and the entrepreneurs should be enrolled in the Communist Party.","I believe in freedom of expression, and I believe that societies thrive when they permit freedom of expression.","The public life of every political figure is a continual struggle to rescue an element of choice from the pressure of circumstance.","To revolutionaries the significant reality is the world which they are fighting to bring about, not the world they are fighting to overcome.","I don\'t have a brief for every single reaction of Israel, but I think it is important that the political negotiations occur free of the threat of terrorism.","A return to the 1967 lines and the abandonment of the settlements near Jerusalem would be such a psychological trauma for Israel as to endanger its survival.","Most high officials leave office with the perceptions and insights with which they entered.","You should not think that you can shape history only by your will. This is also why I\'m against the concept of intervention when you don\'t know its ultimate implications.","It is always easy to divide the world into idealists and power-oriented people. The idealists are presumed to be the noble people, and the power-oriented people are the ones that cause all the world\'s trouble.","I believe that without Watergate we would have had an extraordinary period of success with a strong Nixon and a still vital Brezhnev in power.","Now we have a whole series of problems - energy, environment, proliferation - which go beyond the nation. And we also know that a conflict between major powers would be a catastrophe for which there is no compensation in anything you can gain.","The Vietnam War required us to emphasize the national interest rather than abstract principles. What President Nixon and I tried to do was unnatural. And that is why we didn\'t make it.","In relations with many domestically weak countries, a radio transmitter can be a more effective form of pressure than a squadron B-52s.","Our nation is uniquely endowed to play a creative and decisive role in the new order which is taking form around us.","With proper tactics, nuclear war need not be as destructive as it appears.","We are doomed to coexist.","NAFTA is a major stepping stone to the New World Order.","Well, on the American side, every new administration has to cut its teeth in a crisis, because before a crisis, you don\'t really know what your various subordinates are thinking under stress.","To have the United States suddenly come up with a peace proposal after a whole series of terrorist attacks is going to show to the world that this sort of method is something that western societies can\'t stand.","We believe that peace is at hand.","If Tehran insists on combining the Persian imperial tradition with contemporary Islamic fervor, then a collision with America and, indeed, with its negotiating partners of the Six is unavoidable. Iran simply cannot be permitted to fulfill a dream of imperial rule in a region of such importance to the rest of the world.","The American temptation is to believe that foreign policy is a subdivision of psychiatry.","Before there was the Soviet Union that could inflame matters. Now you have states not as powerful as the Soviet Union, but states like Iraq, like Iran, and to some extent Syria, having made it possible for some of these groups to operate. So it is a very difficult situation.","I go out with actresses because I\'m not apt to marry one.","In the hands of a determined Secretary, the Foreign Service can be a splendid instrument, staffed by knowledgeable, discreet, and energetic individuals. They do require constant vigilance lest the convictions that led them into a penurious career tempt them to preempt decision-making.","Whenever a new president comes in, people that are used to the previous president wonder if he has the same capacity.","Historically when there is a rising power like China, it has usually led to confrontations between the rising power and the existing dominant powers. And when you have a shift of the center of gravity of world affairs from the Atlantic to the Pacific, then you have an additional element.","No, [the U.S.] has made it clear that we consider a peaceful resolution an essential aspect of American foreign policy. This I believe to be a situation understood by China, but again, it is important to not sound too truculent. Taking on a billion-plus Chinese is not an enterprise which one should enter lightly.","Every American president, regardless of party, has said that America has an intense interest in a peaceful resolution. And I think it should be left at that.","Taiwan will probably not declare independence. The question isn\'t independence. The issue is whether Taiwan will declare itself as a sovereign separate state. That will start a huge crisis if that happens.","The emigration of Jews from the Soviet Union is not an objective of American foreign policy. And if they put Jews into gas chambers in the Soviet Union, it is not an American concern. Maybe a humanitarian concern.","He [Deng Xiaoping] said that he did not understand why we failed to grasp that the alternative was not democracy, but total chaos and risking all the reforms that had been achieved.","Competing pressures tempt one to believe that an issue deferred is a problem avoided; more often it is a crisis invited.","From a geo-strategic point of view, I consider Iran a bigger problem than the Islamic State. ISIS is a group of adventurers with a very aggressive ideology. But they have to conquer more and more territory before they can became a geo-strategic, permanent reality. I think a conflict with ISIS - important as it is - is more manageable than a confrontation with Iran.","I am being frank about myself in this book. I tell of my first mistake on page 850.","Blessed are the people whose leaders can look destiny in the eye without flinching but also without attempting to play God.","I think Vladimir Putin will give up power.","I do not believe that Putin intends to leave office in a Cold War atmosphere with the United States.","The Gorbachev period is conceived as an abandonment of historic Russian positions. So this is the framework, in my view, in which Putin operates.","We are used to dealing with problems that have a solution and that can be solved in a finite period. But we\'re at the beginning of a long period of adjustment that does not have a clear-cut terminal point, and in which our wisdom and sophistication and understanding has to be one of the key elements.","The problem is Russia is a country that has lost 300 years of its history, in terms of most of what was part of the Russian Empire in Europe, towards Europe, since Peter the Great, has been the territory that is no longer under Russian rule.","Diplomats operate through deadlock, which is the way by which two sides can test each other\'s determination. Even if they have egos for it few heads of government have the time to resolve stalemates, their meetings are too short and the demands of protocol too heavy.","Iraq has to be made an international, and not just a national American problem.","I was always convinced that decent people in the case of Vietnam, highly intelligent, decent people, got us involved because they had made, in part, a misjudgment about the nature of the communist system and the unity of the communist world and the degree to which the experience of Europe could be repeated in Vietnam.","Let me make my point about Vietnam. When the Nixon initiation came into office, there were 550,000 Americans in combat. And ending the war was not a question of turning off a television channel. And so, debating on how we got there and what judgments were made was not going to help us.","The members of the Islamic Staye have cut the throat of an American on television. This is an insult to the United States, which requires that we demonstrate that this is not an act that is free. I would strongly favor a strong attack on ISIS for a period that is related to the murder of the American.","When you travel as secretary, one problem you have is that the press comes with you and wants an immediate result because it justifies their trip. And sometimes the best result is that you don\'t try to get a result but try to get an understanding for the next time you go to them.","Our problem was that in the American approach to Soviet affairs policy has oscillated between people who take an essentially psychological approach and people who take an essentially theological approach, and the two really meet. The psychologists try to \\"understand\\" the Soviet Union. And try to ease its alleged fears. The theologians say the Soviets are evil.","For my generation the relationship with Europe was the central point of American foreign policy. Even during my time in government there was disagreement, sometimes very strong disagreement. But they were all like arguments within a family. I am not sure if the generation which doesn\'t have these experiences has the same view of things.","I see the future of China as growth. I think that historically China has often gone through periods of consolidation, and then periods of sort of weakening central authority. They undoubtedly face tremendous challenges.","The Russian people, at least the ones I know, have pride in being a Russian. And, therefore, they want to be taken seriously in international affairs.","The Chinese, on the other hand, were in the position of having an American military spy plane on a Chinese military base and they had their own internal problems to deal with. At first, the Chinese weren\'t all that belligerent. They were just stalling to get their own bureaucracy in line.","President Nixon in his inaugural address indicated that he wanted an era of negotiation. Our reasoning was that whatever our ideological differences, whatever our geopolitical differences, we were condemned to coexistence by nuclear weapons.","In the middle \'50s, I had written that the point would come, inevitably, at which the relationship between the cause of conflict and political objectives would be lost.","Why should we flagellate ourselves for what the Cambodians did to each other?","This country cannot afford to tear itself apart on a partisan basis on issues so vital to our national security.","You\'re 18 points down [in the polls]... You might as well do what\'s right.","If a Chinese plane landed at Los Angeles Airport having just bought down an American military plane, he wouldn\'t be permitted to leave the next day. So then we developed a framework which should have been acceptable as a concept to the Chinese, namely to express regret for the loss of life and maintain our position that we had a right to fly these missions.","In the period after the Second World War, there were still leaders in Europe who represented weak countries, but possessed a sense of global foreign policy. Nowadays, on the other hand, there are politicians who represent pretty powerful countries, but whose citizens are not prepared to sacrifice themselves for the state.","The American foreign policy trauma of the sixties and seventies was caused by applying valid principles to unsuitable conditions.","At any rate, mutually assured destruction was never our policy.","American politics are normally a result of pragmatic and not philosophical reasoning. No one in Washington has said we now prefer multilateralism.","We are all the President\'s men.","The idea of abstract power only exists for academics, not in real life.","Some of the critics viewed Vietnam as a morality play in which the wicked must be punished before the final curtain and where any attempt to salvage self-respect from the outcome compounded the wrong. I viewed it as a genuine tragedy. No one had a monopoly on anguish.","The American formal position has been that we oppose violence by governments against their people. That principle should not be abandoned.","America has made it very clear in several administrations that if there is an attack by China on Taiwan, the United States is very likely to resist.","I have said there are three principles that should be followed. One, we should maintain the \\"one China\\" policy that every American president has articulated, including President Reagan. Secondly, we should make clear that we want a peaceful resolution. And three, Taiwan should not challenge that arrangement in a way that will provoke a conflict. Those are three perfectly clear principles. I haven\'t used any of the other slogans.","If I should ever be captured, I want no negotiation - and if I should request a negotiation from captivity they should consider that a sign of duress.","Henceforth the adequacy of any military establishment will be tested by its ability to preserve the peace.","I think a resumption of the Cold War would be a historic tragedy. If a conflict is avoidable, on a basis reflecting morality and security, one should try to avoid it.","Well, he keeps saying that, and as defense secretary, of course he has to think of a lot of potential enemies. I do not think it\'s a wise course to articulate this or to base our policy on it. And I do not see under modern circumstances what we would be fighting about.","Like any developing country, it has an inequality of wealth. In the Chinese case, it is particularly [pronounced] by the fact that they decided they couldn\'t make the whole country move forward simultaneously, so they\'ve started region by region. So the interior regions are much less well off than the coastal regions. And this is certainly a huge challenge, because it produces a flow of populations from the poorer regions to the richer regions.","One thing I don\'t want around me is a military intellectual. I don\'t have to worry about you on that score.","More and more of the Taiwanese economy is connected with the mainland. There are more and more exchanges taking place. There\'s no reason to doubt that over a period of ten years or so, or maybe more, the conditions of life on the two sides of the Taiwan Strait will become more comparable, and the dialogue on the political level therefore easier.","I think China will do nothing to obstruct it, and they probably will go along with it.","Our concern for human rights comes to the fore when there are gross violations of human decencies. Then other countries, including China, must recognize that this affects the American attitude towards their country. But towards what precise institutions will it evolve? I think we ought to leave something to history.","I would have said, before the World Trade Center events, that he would try to get a normal relationship with China - making clear to China what the limits are of what America can accept, but also showing understanding for some of Chinese necessities. I thought he was moving towards the position that I have more or less advocated.","In the 1960s, I would have considered China with its CPC an ideologically more dynamic country than the Soviet Union. But the Soviet Union was strategically more threatening.","Many of the scientists have believed that their contribution to ending the nuclear race is not to let any new weapons to be developed.","The position is that stability and peace in Asia depend on a cooperative relationship between China and the United States.","We are not just any nation.","Everybody who has dealt with China over an extended period of time has come to more or less the same conclusions. There are nuances of differences, but not fundamental differences. I think that President Bush was heading in this direction, and I have no doubt that he will again wind up in this position. But right now he has to be preoccupied with the atrocity committed in New York and Washington.","I think an appeal to American idealism and willingness to sacrifice would be an important contribution, because what is happening now in many countries, not yet in the United States, but in many European countries, it\'s the inability of government to ask for sacrifices of its people.","You know, this is a very strange phenomenon. I keep reading that in American newspapers, and I keep reading extensive speculations. I meet with the Chinese leaders periodically, and while I don\'t say they\'ve endorsed the missile shield, it has not been in the forefront of their discussions.","Corrupt politicians make the other ten percent look bad.","Nobody will ever win the battle of the sexes. There is too much fraternizing with the enemy.","There can\'t be a crisis next week, my schedule is already full.","America has no permanent friends or enemies, only interests","The nice thing about being a celebrity is that if you bore people they think it\'s their fault.","Every victory is only the price of admission to a more difficult problem","A country that demands moral perfection in its foreign policy will achieve neither perfection nor security","A diamond is a chunk of coal that did well under pressure.","Poor old Germany. Too big for Europe, too small for the world","The state is a fragile organization, and the statesman does not have the moral right to risk its survival on ethical restraint.","The reason that university politics is so vicious is because stakes are so small","Blessed are the people whose leaders can look destiny in the eye without flinching but also without attempting to play God","We fought a military war; our opponents fought a political one. We sought physical attrition; our opponents aimed for our psychological exhaustion. In the process we lost sight of one of the cardinal maxims of guerrilla war: the guerrilla wins if he does not lose. The conventional army loses if it does not win. The North Vietnamese used their armed forces the way a bull-fighter uses his cape \u2014 to keep us lunging in areas of marginal political importance.","It\'s a pity both sides can\'t lose (commenting on Iran-Iraq war, 1980 \u2013 1988)","A turbulent history has taught Chinese leaders that not every problem has a solution and that too great an emphasis on total mastery over specific events could upset the harmony of the universe.","Intellectuals analyze the operations of international systems; statesmen build them.","Facts are rarely self-explanatory; their significance, analysis, and interpretation\u2014at least in the foreign policy world\u2014depend on context and relevance.","In Washington...the appearance of power is therefore almost as important as the reality of it. In fact, the appearance is frequently its essential reality","Because complexity inhibits flexibility, early choices are especially crucial.","Americans have a tendency to believe that when there\'s a problem there must be a solution.","George Bernard Shaw: \u201cThere are two tragedies in life. One is to lose your heart\u2019s desire. The other is to gain it.","The war is just when the intention that causes it to be undertaken is just. The will is therefore the principle element that must be considered, not the means... He who intends to kill the guilty sometimes faultlessly shed the blood of the innocents...\'In short, the end justifies the means.","To undertake a journey on a road never before traveled requires character and courage: character because the choice is not obvious; courage because the road will be lonely at first. And the statesman must then inspire his people to persist in the endeavor.","Since Peter the Great, Russia had been expanding at the rate of one Belgium per year.","Empires have no interest in operating within an international system; they aspire to be the international system.","power without legitimacy tempts tests of strength; legitimacy without power tepmts empty posturing.","If Tehran insists on combining the Persian imperial tradition with contemporary Islamic fervor, then a collision with America \u2014 and, indeed, with its negotiating partners of the Six \u2014 is unavoidable. Iran simply cannot be permitted to fulfill a dream of imperial rule in a region of such importance to the rest of the world.","The United States is baiting China and Russia, and the final nail in the coffin will be Iran, which is, of course, the main target of Israel. We have allowed China to increase their military strength and Russia to recover from Sovietization, to give them a false sense of bravado, this will create an all together faster demise for them. We\u2019re like the sharp shooter daring the noob to pick up the gun, and when they try, it\u2019s bang bang. The coming war will be so severe that only one superpower can win, and that\u2019s us folks. This is why the EU is in such a hurry to form a complete superstate because they know what is coming, and to survive, Europe will have to be one whole cohesive state. Their urgency tells me that they know full well that the big showdown is upon us. O how I have dreamed of this delightful moment.","The acquisition of knowledge from books provides an experience different from the Internet. Reading is relatively time-consuming; to ease the process, style is important. Because it is not possible to read all books on a given subject, much less the totality of all books, or to organize easily everything one has read, learning from books places a premium on conceptual thinking\u2014the ability to recognize comparable data and events and project patterns into the future. And style propels the reader into a relationship with the author, or with the subject matter, by fusing substance and aesthetics. Traditionally, another way of acquiring knowledge has been through personal conversations. The discussion and exchange of ideas has for millennia provided an emotional and psychological dimension in addition to the factual content of the information exchanged. It supplies intangibles of conviction and personality. Now the culture of texting produces a curious reluctance to engage in face-to-face interaction, especially on a one-to-one basis.","Because information is so accessible and communication instantaneous, there is a diminution of focus on its significance, or even on the definition of what is significant. This dynamic may encourage policymakers to wait for an issue to arise rather than anticipate it, and to regard moments of decision as a series of isolated events rather than part of a historical continuum. When this happens, manipulation of information replaces reflection as the principal policy tool.","Politicians are like dogs... Their life expectancy is too short for a commitment to be bearable","A more immediate issue concerns North Korea, to which Bismarck\u2019s nineteenth-century aphorism surely applies: \u201cWe live in a wondrous time, in which the strong is weak because of his scruples and the weak grows strong because of his audacity.","Woe to the statesman whose arguments for entering a war are not as convincing at its end as they were at the beginning, Bismarck had cautioned.\u201d","both the American and the European approaches to foreign policy were the products of their own unique circumstances. Americans inhabited a nearly empty continent shielded from predatory powers by two vast oceans and with weak countries as neighbors. Since America confronted no power in need of being balanced, it could hardly have occupied itself with the challenges of equilibrium even if its leaders had been seized by the bizarre notion of replicating European conditions amidst a people who had turned their backs on Europe.","If Chinese exceptionalism represented the claims of a universal empire, Japanese exceptionalism sprang from the insecurities of an island nation borrowing heavily from its neighbor, but fearful of being dominated by it.","The Soviet Union would never be bound by agreements, Deng warned; it understood only the language of countervailing force.","in effect, none of the most important countries which must build a new world order have had any experience with the multistate system that is emerging. Never before has a new world order had to be assembled from so many different perceptions, or on so global a scale.","\u2026Policy is the art of the possible, the science of the relative.","What distinguishes Sun Tzu from Western writers on strategy is the emphasis on the psychological and political elements over the purely military.","The acquisition of knowledge from books provides an experience different from the Internet.

Too punitive for conciliation, too lenient to keep Germany from recovering, the Treaty of Versailles condemned the exhausted democracies to constant vigilance against an irreconcilable and revanchist Germany as well as a revolutionary Soviet Union.","history teaches by analogy, shedding light on the likely consequences of comparable situations.","For the greatest part of humanity and the longest periods of history, empire has been the typical mode of government.","And history teaches this iron law of revolutions: the more extensive the eradication of existing authority, the more its successors must rely on naked power to establish themselves. For,in the end,legitimacy involves an acceptance of authority without compulsion; its absence turns every contest into a test of strength.","Islamic legal rulings stipulate that a treaty cannot be forever, since it must be immediately void should the Muslims become capable of fighting them. What these treaties did not imply was a permanent system in which the Islamic state would interact on equal terms with sovereign non-Muslim states: \u201cThe communities of the dar al-harb were regarded as being in a \u2018state of nature,\u2019 for they lacked legal competence to enter into intercourse with Islam on the basis of equality and reciprocity because they failed to conform to its ethical and legal standards.\u201d Because in this view the domestic principles of an Islamic state were divinely ordained, non-Muslim political entities were illegitimate; they could never be accepted by Muslim states as truly equal counterparts. A peaceful world order depended on the ability to forge and expand a unitary Islamic entity, not on an equilibrium of competing parts.\u201d","Order should not have priority over freedom. But the affirmation of freedom should be elevated from a mood to a strategy.","From all the great and indispensable achievements the Internet has brought to our era, its emphasis is on the actual more than the contingent, on the factual rather than the conceptual, on values shaped by consensus rather than by introspection. Knowledge of history and geography is not essential for whose who can evoke their data with the touch of a button. The mindset for walking lonely political paths may not be self-evident to those who seek confirmation by hundreds, sometimes thousands of friends on Facebook","Any system of world order, to be sustainable, must be accepted as just\u2014not only by leaders, but also by citizens. It must reflect two truths: order without freedom, even if sustained by momentary exaltation, eventually creates its own counterpoise; yet freedom cannot be secured or sustained without a framework of order to keep the peace. Order and freedom, sometimes described as opposite poles on the spectrum of experience, should instead be understood as interdependent. Can today\u2019s leaders rise above the urgency of day-to-day events to achieve this balance?","Realpolitik for Bismarck depended on flexibility and on the ability to exploit every available option without the constraint of ideology.","The poet T.

First, the indispensable element of a successful foreign policy is a long-term strategic concept based on a careful analysis of all relevant factors.

This view acknowledges the colossal wrongs committed during the Cultural Revolution, but it begins to inquire whether perhaps Mao raised an important question, even if his answer to it proved disastrous. The problem Mao is said to have identified is the relationship of the modern state\u2014especially the Communist state\u2014to the people it governs. In largely agricultural\u2014and even incipient industrial\u2014societies, governance concerns issues within the capacity of the general public to understand.

It must reflect two truths: order without freedom, even if sustained by momentary exaltation, eventually creates its own counterpoise; yet freedom cannot be secured or sustained without a framework of order to keep the peace. Order and freedom, sometimes described as opposite poles on the spectrum of experience, should instead be understood as interdependent.","The rich fertility of China\u2019s plains and a culture of uncommon resilience and political acumen had enabled China to remain unified over much of a two-millennia period and to exercise considerable political, economic, and cultural influence\u2014even when it was militarily weak by conventional standards. Its comparative advantage resided in the wealth of its economy, which produced goods that all of its neighbors desired. Shaped by these elements, the Chinese idea of world order differed markedly from the European experience based on a multiplicity of co-equal states.","Two other issues are contributing to tension in Sino-American relations. China rejects the proposition that international order is fostered by the spread of liberal democracy and that the international community has an obligation to bring this about, and especially to achieve its perception of human rights by international action. The United States may be able to adjust the application of its views on human rights in relation to strategic priorities. But in light of its history and the convictions of its people, America can never abandon these principles altogether. On the Chinese side, the dominant elite view on this subject was expressed by Deng Xiaoping: Actually, national sovereignty is far more important than human rights, but the Group of Seven (or Eight) often infringe upon the sovereignty of poor, weak countries of the Third World. Their talk about human rights, freedom and democracy is designed only to safeguard the interests of the strong, rich countries, which take advantage of their strength to bully weak countries, and which pursue hegemony and practice power politics. No formal compromise is possible between these views; to keep the disagreement from spiraling into conflict is one of the principal obligations of the leaders of both sides.","The lowest form of war is To attack Cities.

In Qutb\u2019s view, Islam was a universal system offering the only true form of freedom: freedom from governance by other men, man-made doctrines, or \u201clow associations based on race and color, language and country, regional and national interests (that is, all other modern forms of governance and loyalty and some of the building blocks of Westphalian order). Islam\u2019s modern mission, in Qutb\u2019s view, was to overthrow them all and replace them with what he took to be a literal, eventually global implementation of the Quran. The culmination of this process would be \u201cthe achievement of the freedom of man on earth\u2014of all mankind throughout the earth.\u201d This would complete the process begun by the initial wave of Islamic expansion in the seventh and eighth centuries, \u201cwhich is then to be carried throughout the earth to the whole of mankind, as the object of this religion is all humanity and its sphere of action is the whole earth.\u201d Like all utopian projects, this one would require extreme measures to implement. These Qutb assigned to an ideologically pure vanguard, who would reject the governments and societies prevailing in the region\u2014all of which Qutb branded \u201cunIslamic and illegal\u201d\u2014and seize the initiative in bringing about the new order.\u201d","V mezin\xe1rodn\xedm uspo\u0159\xe1d\xe1n\xed v \xe9\u0159e studen\xe9 v\xe1lky se odr\xe1\u017eely dva typy rovnov\xe1hy, poprv\xe9 v d\u011bjin\xe1ch navz\xe1jem podstatn\u011b nez\xe1visl\xe9: jednak nukle\xe1rn\xed rovnov\xe1ha mezi SSSR a USA, jednak vnit\u0159n\xed rovnov\xe1ha uvnit\u0159 Severoatlantick\xe9 aliance, jej\xed\u017e p\u016fsoben\xed bylo v podstatn\xe9 m\xed\u0159e psychologick\xe9.

The analyst can allot whatever time is necessary to come to a clear conclusion; the overwhelming challenge to the statesman is the pressure of time. The analyst runs no risk. If his conclusions prove wrong, he can write another treatise. The statesman is permitted only one guess; his mistakes are irretrievable. The analyst has available to him all the facts; he will be judged on his intellectual power. The statesman must act on assessments that cannot be proved at the time that he is making them; he will be judged by history on the basis of how wisely he managed the inevitable change and, above all, by how well he preserves the peace.","Germany achieved unification as an affirmation of liberal democracy; it reaffirmed its commitment to European unity as a project of common values and shared development.","In the Chinese version of exceptionalism, China did not export its ideas but let others come to seek them.","...were history confined to the mechanical repetition of the past, no transformation would ever have occurred.
