Thus it is thought, for instance, that certain deer in paleontological times succumbed as they acquired overly-heavy horns. The mutations must be considered blind, they work, are thrown forth, without any contact of interest with their environment. In depressive states, the mind may be seen in the image of such an antler, in all its fantastic splendour pinning its bearer to the ground.","Man is the ultimate tragic being, because he has learned enough about the Earth to realise the Earth would be better off without the presence of humankind.","Each new generation asks \u2013 What is the meaning of life? A more fertile way of putting the question would be \u2013 Why does man need a meaning to life?","The dread of being stares us in the eye, and in a deadly gush we perceive how the minds are dangling in threads of their own spinning, and that a hell is lurking underneath.","The modern barbarity of \u2018saving\u2019 the suicidal is based on a hairraising misapprehension of the nature of existence.","The human yearning is not merely marked by a \u2018striving toward\u2019, but equally by an \u2018escape from.","Cultural history, as well as observation of ourselves and others, allow the following answer: Most people learn to save themselves by artificially limiting the content of consciousness.","But as he stands before imminent death, he grasps its nature also, and the cosmic import of the step to come. His creative imagination constructs new, fearful prospects behind the curtain of death, and he sees that even there is no sanctuary found. And now he can discern the outline of his biologico-cosmic terms: He is the universe\u2019s helpless captive, kept to fall into nameless possibilities. From this moment on, he is in a state of relentless panic.","No future triumph or metamorphosis can justify the pitiful blighting of a human being against his will.","He is the universe\u2019s helpless captive, kept to fall into nameless possibilities.","\u2013 The life of the worlds is a roaring river, but Earth\u2019s is a pond and a backwater.\u2013 The sign of doom is written on your brows \u2013 how long will ye kick against the pin-pricks?\u2013 But there is one conquest and one crown, one redemption and one solution.\u2013 Know yourselves \u2013 be infertile and let the earth be silent after ye.","Man beholds the earth, and it is breathing like a great lung; whenever it exhales, delightful life swarms from all its pores and reaches out toward the sun, but when it inhales, a moan of rupture passes through the multitude, and corpses whip the ground like bouts of hail.","Man beholds the earth, and it is breathing like a great lung; whenever it exhales, delightful life swarms from all its pores and reaches out toward the sun, but when it inhales, a moan of rupture passes through the multitude, and corpses whip the ground like bouts of hail. Not merely his own day could he see, the graveyards wrung themselves before his gaze, the laments of sunken millennia wailed against him from the ghastly decaying shapes, the earth-turned dreams of mothers. Future\u2019s curtain unravelled itself to reveal a nightmare of endless repetition, a senseless squander of organic material. The suffering of human billions makes its entrance into him through the gateway of compassion, from all that happen arises a laughter to mock the demand for justice, his profoundest ordering principle.","Despite his new eyes, man was still rooted in matter, his soul spun into it and subordinated to its blind laws. And yet he could see matter as a stranger, compare himself to all phenomena, see through and locate his vital processes. He comes to nature as an unbidden guest, in vain extending his arms to beg conciliation with his maker: Nature answers no more, it preformed a miracle with man, but later did not know him","Another flaw of the system is the fact that various danger fronts often require very different firmaments. As a logical superstructure is built upon each, there follow clashes of incommensurable modes of feeling and thought. Then despair can enter through the rifts. In such cases, a person may be obsessed with destructive joy, dislodging the whole artificial apparatus of his life and starting with rapturous horror to make a clean sweep of it. The horror stems from the loss of all sheltering values, the rapture from his by now ruthless identification and harmony with our nature\u2019s deepest secret, the biological unsoundness, the enduring disposition for doom.","One night in long bygone times, man awoke and saw himself.He saw that he was naked under cosmos, homeless in his own body. All things dissolved before his testing thought, wonder above wonder, horror above horror unfolded in his mind.Then woman too awoke and said it was time to go and slay. And he fetched his bow and arrow, a fruit of the marriage of spirit and hand, and went outside beneath the stars. But as the beasts arrived at their waterholes where he expected them of habit, he felt no more the tiger\u2019s bound in his blood, but a great psalm about the brotherhood of suffering between everything alive.That day he did not return with prey, and when they found him by the next new moon, he was sitting dead by the waterhole.","A man will come forth, who before all other men has dared to strip his soul naked and give himself wholly over to our most profound questioning, even to the idea of annihilation. A man who has grasped life in its cosmic context, and whose agony is the agony of the world. But such a rising wail will assail him from all the people of the earth, crying for his thousandfold execution, when his voice blankets the world like a shroud, and his peculiar message is heard for the first and last time:The life on many worlds is like a rushing river, but the life on this world is like a stagnant puddle and a backwater.The mark of annihilation is written on thy brow. How long will ye mill about on the edge? But there is one victory and one crown, and one salvation and one answer: Know thyselves; be unfruitful and let there be peace on Earth after thy passing.","S\xe5 kastet jeg mig over Turistforeningens \xc5rb\xf8ker og slukte hvad jeg fandt om klatring. Horunger, n\xe5ler og Dj\xe6vleskar! Store Gud!","He is mighty in the near world, but curses his might as purchased with his harmony of soul, his innocence, his inner peace in life\u2019s embrace.","Spindelv\xe6vlette, verdenshavtunge fjernerspr\xe6nger i dragsug menneskesj\xe6le og stjerner - intet har form eller navn. Se, jeg er stille - se, jeg er rum og susning, se, jeg er aften efter en br\xe6ndende dag. Jeg er alt, og alt er i mig, og mit hjertef\xf8lger i d\xf8ende rytmer tidernes aandedrag.","Men hensigten, sp\xf8r folket, meningen, maalet? Der er ingen hensigt, der er intet maal. Tindesporten er meningsl\xf8s som selve livet, - derfor kan dens trolddom aldrig d\xf8.","Det er tre ting en mand vil ha for sig selv, og det tredie er soveposen.","Every social unit is a large, rounded attachment system, built on the solid beams of basic cultural ways of thinking. The common man manages with these shared cultural beams, his personality almost builds itself. Our personality has stopped developing, and rests on inherited cultural foundations: God, the church, the state, morality, destiny, the laws of life, the future.The closer a norm lies to the bearing beams, the more dangerous it is to disturb it. As a rule, those close-lying norms are protected by laws and threats of punishment\u2014the Inquisition, censorship, conservative attitudes, and so forth.","Jo riktig, jeg forlot min venn i to fingre p\xe5 luselisten. Men han hang ikke s\xe5nn i sin simple almindelighet, nei det m\xe5 man endelig ikke tro. For man tar feil hvis man tror det. S\xf8rgelig feil tar man. For han hang mellem det fysiske og det astrale, mellem meditation og metamorforse, mellem f\xf8rste og anden aggregattilstand i fysisk henseende, og mellem fjerde og femte dimension i transcendentalplanet. S\xe5 det var bra han ikke kjendte nerver av navn.","Se i mig en 96 graders venn.","Dokker tr\xe6ng en hest,\\" sa de. \\"Ja vil dokker bryte dokker s\xe5 grynsm\xe5,\\" sa han, \\"s\xe5 har \xe6 no m\xe6rra her.

Str\xf8k i geografi. Men det l\xe5 i nordvest. Jeg blev mykere. -Kan du - hm- kan du sv\xe6rge p\xe5 at det var et fjeld?-Det var iallfald et sted uten tr\xe6r.

H\xe5kon kaldte mig genial, og jeg svarte at han var en stor menneskekjender.","Timer - timer i fjeldene.

N\xe5r tanken g\xe5r mot den store g\xe5de, da blir kanh\xe6nde tinden til hans altersten - og det som damper av den er ikke blod (sk\xf8nt den kr\xe6ver sitt offer iblandt), men nattens stigende t\xe5ker gjennemlyst av soloppgangen.","Dr\xf8mme t\xe5ler ikke \xe5 bli virkeliggjort, sier dikterne, for da d\xf8r de. Her gikk den lys levende og i all sin h\xf8ireiste glans like lukt ind i sin jordiske inkarnation - i et fjorten hundrede meters eventyrslott av s\xf8lvgr\xe5 granitt.","Fjordene fylder sine lunger med uv\xf8rne drag der nord, og himlen har kort mellem gl\xe6de og sorg.","Jeg ligger og kjender at jeg hader dette forbandede fjeld, fordi det har makt over mitt sind. Hvad vil du mig - at jeg er kommet de utalte mil fra en blidere egn for \xe5 slite mig ut p\xe5 dine endel\xf8se skr\xe5ninger og dingle som en misd\xe6der over utslettelsen?","Vi samles p\xe5 Fortroppens hj\xf8rne mot vest og ser over mot tinden.

A breach in the very unity of life, a biological paradox, an abomination, an absurdity, an exaggeration of disastrous nature. Life had overshot its target, blowing itself apart. A species had been armed too heavily \u2013 by spirit made almighty without, but equally a menace to its own well-being\u2026So there he stands with his visions, betrayed by the universe, in wonder and fear. The beast knew fear as well, in thunderstorms and on the lion\u2019s claw. But man became fearful of life itself \u2013 indeed, of his very being.","- og nu er det jeg som st\xe5r og blir liten p\xe5 den siste krumning i hyldens blygt hend\xf8ende motiv.-Dr\xf8mmer jeg?

For the honest questioner, however, who doesn\u2019t seek refuge in some faith or fantasy, there will never be an answer.","Vi sitter p\xe5 varden og lar blikket seile. Fra j\xf8kelens islys i \xf8st til Lofotv\xe6ggens hilderland i vest under havranden. Det ryker av dypet og det driver av himlen, mens storm og t\xe5ke knuses mot hj\xf8rner og gj\xe9l. Og syn og sus flyter sammen til en saga om mineralets evige suver\xe6nitet.","Som skodden skapes, \xe6ndres og forsvinder - slik skummer ogs\xe5 livsformerne for fjeldets fot. Det er ikke menneskealdre Stetinden har skuet ned p\xe5 fra sin ensomme h\xf8ide, men jordaldre.","Da revner t\xe5ken - og endnu en gang st\xe5r han for oss, titanen, lynomfunklet, vassdrivende, skinnende som smergelpusset jern.

That the cosmic consciousness will awaken again, when the group\'s existence is assured, lies beyond doubt. Faust is not dead, he is just sleeping.","But the god himself in the book of Job, does he concern us? Is it all but a poetic play with a strange and too old-fashioned conception of God? Do we know this god? Well, we know him from the history of religion, he is the god of the old testament, the army of the armies, or as we would say, the army god, the jealous Yahweh. But does he only live in the history of religion? No, he also reigns in our experience, today as before 2400 years ago. He represents a well-known biological and social environment: the blind forces of nature that are without contact with man\'s drive towards order and meaning, of disease and the erratic impact of death, the fleetingness of fame, betrayal of friends and relatives. He is the machine and the god of power, domination of violence, party slavery and conquest alike, the god of copper pipes and armor plates. There are more than Job, who meets him with the weapon of the spirit. Some of them being trampled into heroic martyrdom; others also see the limitation of marty reed, they bend inwardly, but hide for the doubt in their heart.","En natt i lengst forsvundne tider v\xe5knet mennesket og s\xe5 seg selv... da dyrene kom til sine vannhull, hvor han ventet dem av gammel vane, da kjente han ikke lenger tigerspranget i sitt blod, men en stor salme om lidelsens broderskap mellom alt som lever.","Now it understood that everything was lost and that the dream was dead too resistant. And when the dream was dead, the wick was not even weeks longer, but a fairly common thread.","Life had overshot its target, blowing itself apart. A species had been armed too heavily \u2013 by spirit made almighty without, but equally a menace to its own well-being.","Thunder belches around him, but it does not affect him, nothing affects him, as he sits enthroned in his Olympic indifference over the hectic course of life\u2014an anvil for the gods to hammer on.","Therefore, the eyes of mankind also seek his distant, vanished tomb, where the very deadly cold preserves his form. Until finally, long - it breaks loose thunderously and sails with the storm out towards the deep, dark blue sea in one huge, sun-sparkling sarcophagus.","if a desert island is no tragedy, why is a deserted planet?"]')}}]);
