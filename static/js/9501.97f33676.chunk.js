When you trap people in a system of debt, they can\'t afford the time to think.","The general population doesn\'t know what\'s happening, and it doesn\'t even know that it doesn\'t know.","The smart way to keep people passive and obedient is to strictly limit the spectrum of acceptable opinion, but allow very lively debate within that spectrum - even encourage the more critical and dissident views. That gives people the sense that there\'s free thinking going on, while all the time the presuppositions of the system are being reinforced by the limits put on the range of the debate.","As long as the general population is passive, apathetic, diverted to consumerism or hatred of the vulnerable, then the powerful can do as they please, and those who survive will be left to contemplate the outcome.","Nobody is going to pour truth into your brain. It\'s something you have to find out for yourself.","He who controls the media controls the minds of the public.","Optimism is a strategy for making a better future. Because unless you believe that the future can be better, it\u2019s unlikely you will step up and take responsibility for making it so. If you assume that there\u2019s no hope, you guarantee that there will be no hope. If you assume that there is an instinct for freedom, there are opportunities to change things, there\u2019s a chance you may contribute to making a better world. The choice is yours.","The indoctrination is so deep that educated people think they\u2019re being objective.","It\u2019s ridiculous to talk about freedom in a society dominated by huge corporations. What kind of freedom is there inside a corporation? They\u2019re totalitarian institutions - you take orders from above and maybe give them to people below you. There\u2019s about as much freedom as under Stalinism.","Democratic societies can\'t force people. Therefore they have to control what they think.","If we don\'t believe in free expression for people we despise, we don\'t believe in it at all.","It doesn\'t matter how much you learn in school; it\'s whether you learn how to go on and do things by yourself. And that can be done at any level.","Education is a system of imposed ignorance.","If something is repeated over and over as obvious, the chances are that it is obviously false.","The key element of social control is the strategy of distraction that is to divert public attention from important issues and changes decided by political and economic elites, through the technique of flood or flooding continuous distractions and insignificant information.","Hypocrites are those who apply to others the standards that they refuse to accept for themselves.","The world is a very puzzling place. If you\'re not willing to be puzzled, you just become a replica of someone else\'s mind.","A language is not just words. It\'s a culture, a tradition, a unification of a community, a whole history that creates what a community is. It\'s all embodied in a language.","If voting could actually change anything, it would be illegal.","If you go to one demonstration and then go home, that\'s something, but the people in power can live with that. What they can\'t live with is sustained pressure that keeps building, organisations that keep doing things, people that keep learning lessons from the last time and doing it better the next time.","It is the responsibility of intellectuals to speak the truth and expose lies.","Nobody should have any illusions. The United States has essentially a one-party system and the ruling party is the business party.","Goebbels was in favor of free speech for views he liked. So was Stalin. If you\u2019re really in favor of free speech, then you\u2019re in favor of freedom of speech for precisely the views you despise. Otherwise, you\u2019re not in favor of free speech.","The whole educational and professional training system is a very elaborate filter, which just weeds out people who are too independent, and who think for themselves, and who don\'t know how to be submissive, and so on -- because they\'re dysfunctional to the institutions.","The point of public relations slogans like \\"Support Our Troops\\" is that they don\'t mean anything ... that\'s the whole point of good propaganda. You want to create a slogan that nobody is going to be against and I suppose everybody will be for, because nobody knows what it means, because it doesn\'t mean anything. But its crucial value is that it diverts your attention from a question that does mean something, do you support our policy? And that\'s the one you\'re not allowed to talk about.","Jingoism, racism, fear, religious fundamentalism: these are the ways of appealing to people if you\'re trying to organize a mass base of support for policies that are really intended to crush them.","Governments will use whatever technology is available to combat their primary enemy - their own population.","That\'s the standard technique of privatization: defund, make sure things don\'t work, people get angry, you hand it over to private capital.","I try to encourage people to think for themselves, to question standard assumptions... Don\'t take assumptions for granted. Begin by taking a skeptical attitude toward anything that is conventional wisdom. Make it justify itself. It usually can\'t. Be willing to ask questions about what is taken for granted. Try to think things through for yourself.","If we choose, we can live in a world of comforting illusion.","Anyone who studies declassified documents soon becomes aware that government secrecy is largely an effort to protect policy makers from scrutiny by citizens, not to protect the country from enemies.","Neoliberal democracy. Instead of citizens, it produces consumers. Instead of communities, it produces shopping malls. The net result is an atomized society of disengaged individuals who feel demoralized and socially powerless. In sum, neoliberalism is the immediate and foremost enemy of genuine participatory democracy, not just in the United States but across the planet, and will be for the foreseeable future.","When I was in high school I asked myself at one point: \\"Why do I care if my high school\'s team wins the football game? I don\'t know anybody on the team, they have nothing to do with me... why am I here and applaud? It does not make any sense.\\" But the point is, it does make sense: It\'s a way of building up irrational attitudes of submission to authority and group cohesion behind leadership elements. In fact it\'s training in irrational jingoism. That\'s also a feature of competitive sports.","There\'s a good reason why nobody studies history, it just teaches you too much.","What\'s the point of being better than someone else?","If you want to control a population... give them a God to worship.","The smart way to keep people passive and obedient is to strictly limit the spectrum of acceptable opinion, but allow very lively debate within that spectrum.","In the US, there is basically one party - the business party. It has two factions, called Democrats and Republicans, which are somewhat different but carry out variations on the same policies. By and large, I am opposed to those policies. As is most of the population.","It\u2019s pretty ironic that the so-called \u2018least advanced\u2019 people are the ones taking the lead in trying to protect all of us, while the richest and most powerful among us are the ones who are trying to drive the society to destruction.","If you are not offending people who ought to be offended, you\'re doing something wrong.","A basic principle of modern state capitalism is that costs and risks are socialized to the extent possible, while profit is privatized.","If you assume that there is no hope, you guarantee that there will be no hope. If you assume that there is an instinct for freedom, that there are opportunities to change things, then there is a possibility that you can contribute to making a better world.","Far from creating independent thinkers, schools have always, throughout history, played an institutional role in a system of control and coercion. And once you are well educated you have already been socialized in ways that support the power structure, which, in turn, rewards you immensely.","Do you train for passing tests or do you train for creative inquiry?","Moral cowardice and intellectual corruption are the natural concomitants of unchallenged privilege.","Either you repeat the same conventional doctrines everybody is saying, or else you say something true, and it will sound like it\'s from Neptune.","The best defense against democracy is to distract people.","You cannot control your own population by force, but it can be distracted by consumption.","The media want to maintain their intimate relation to state power. They want to get leaks, they want to get invited to the press conferences. They want to rub shoulders with the Secretary of State, all that kind of business. To do that, you\'ve got to play the game, and playing the game means telling their lies, serving as their disinformation apparatus.","How it is we have so much information, but know so little?","Capitalism is a system in which the central institutions of society are, in principle, under autocratic control. Thus, a corporation or an industry is, if we were to think of it in political terms, fascist, that is, it has tight control at the top and strict obedience has to be established at every level. [...] Just as I\'m opposed to political fascism, I am opposed to economic fascism. I think that until the major institutions of society are under the popular control of participants and communities, it\'s pointless to talk about democracy.","The police can go to downtown Harlem and pick up a kid with a joint in the streets. But they can\'t go into the elegant apartments and get a stockbroker who\'s sniffing cocaine.","You are responsible for the predictable consequences of your actions.","We shouldn\'t be looking for heroes, we should be looking for good ideas.","If the Nuremberg laws were applied, then every post-war American president would have been hanged.","For the powerful, crimes are those that others commit.","All public resources go to the rich. The poor, if they can survive in the labor market, fine. Otherwise, they die. That\'s economics in a nutshell.","A captured pirate was brought before Alexander the Great. \u201cHow dare you molest the sea?\u201d asked Alexander. \u201cHow dare you molest the whole world?\u201d the pirate replied, and continued: \u201cBecause I do it with a little ship only, I am called a thief; you, doing it with a great navy, are called an emperor.","Everybody\'s worried about stopping terrorism. Well, there\'s a really easy way: stop participating in it.","The goal is to keep the bewildered herd bewildered. It\'s unnecessary for them to trouble themselves with what\'s happening in the world. In fact, it\'s undesirable - if they see too much of reality they may set themselves to change it.","It takes one minute to tell a lie, and an hour to refute it.","The public is not to see where power lies, how it shapes policy, and for what ends. Rather, people are to hate and fear one another.","If you want to make changes in the world, you\'re going to have to be there day after day doing the boring, straightforward work of getting a couple of people interested and building a slightly bigger organization and carrying out the next move and suffering frustration and finally getting somewhere. That\'s how the world changes.","One of the greatest dangers is secular religion - state worship.","If anybody thinks they should listen to me because I\'m a professor at MIT, that\'s nonsense. You should decide whether something makes sense by its content, not by the letters after the name of the person who says it.","One might ask why tobacco is legal and marijuana not. A possible answer is suggested by the nature of the crop. Marijuana can be grown almost anywhere, with little difficulty. It might not be easily marketable by major corporations. Tobacco is quite another story.","The more you can increase fear of drugs and crime, welfare mothers, immigrants and aliens, the more you control all the people.","That\'s the whole point of good propaganda. You want to create a slogan that nobody\'s going to be against, and everybody\'s going to be for. Nobody knows what it means, because it doesn\'t mean anything.","If you care about other people, you might try to organize to undermine power and authority. That\'s not going to happen if you care only about yourself.","People are capable of seeing the deceit they\'re ensnared in. They just have to make the effort.","To live a life of honesty and integrity is a responsibility of every decent person.","I have no Facebook page or Twitter - I don\'t participate in it, and I don\'t like it particularly. I mean, it\'s a form of interaction, which strikes me as extremely superficial.","Language etches the grooves through which your thoughts must flow.","The press is owned by wealthy men who only want certain things to reach the public.","Concentration of wealth yields concentration of political power. And concentration of political power gives rise to legislation that increases and accelerates the cycle.","Globalization is the result of powerful governments, especially that of the United States, pushing trade deals and other accords down the throats of the world\u2019s people to make it easier for corporations and the wealthy to dominate the economies of nations around the world without having obligations to the peoples of those nations.","What is called \'capitalism\'is basically a system of corporate mercantilism, with huge and largely unaccountable private tyrannies exercising vast control over the economy, political systems, and social and cultural life, operating in close cooperation with powerful states that intervene massively in the domestic economy and international society.","Every great power, every aggressive power has always regarded itself as exceptional and as doing things only for the most moral ends.","The most effective way to restrict democracy is to transfer decision-making from the public arena to unaccountable institutions: kings and princes, priestly castes, military juntas, party dictatorships, or modern corporations.","See, people with power understand exactly one thing: violence.","Control of thought is more important for governments that are free and popular than for despotic and military states. The logic is straightforward: a despotic state can control its domestic enemies by force, but as the state loses this weapon, other devices are required to prevent the ignorant masses from interfering with public affairs, which are none of their business\u2026 the public are to be observers, not participants, consumers of ideology as well as products.","We still name our military helicopter gunships after victims of genocide. Nobody bats an eyelash about that: Blackhawk. Apache. And Comanche. If the Luftwaffe named its military helicopters Jew and Gypsy, I suppose people would notice.","The United States happens to be the only state in the world that has been condemned by the World Court for international terrorism.","When Israelis in the occupied territories now claim that they have to defend themselves, they are defending themselves in the sense that any military occupier has to defend itself against the population they are crushing. You can\'t defend yourself when you\'re militarily occupying someone else\'s land. That\'s not defense. Call it what you like, it\'s not defense.","It may be beyond the limits of human intelligence to understand how human intelligence works.","Because they don\'t teach the truth about the world, schools have to rely on beating students over the head with propaganda about democracy. If schools were, in reality, democratic, there would be no need to bombard students with platitudes about democracy. They would simply act and behave democratically, and we know this does not happen. The more there is a need to talk about the ideals of democracy, the less democratic the system usually is.","There are very few people who are going to look into the mirror and say, \'That person I see is a savage monster;\' instead, they make up some construction that justifies what they do.","You keep plugging away--that\'s the way social change takes place. That\'s the way every social change in history has taken place: by a lot of people, who nobody ever heard of, doing work.","Students who acquire large debts putting themselves through school are unlikely to think about changing society. When you trap people in a system of debt, they can\'t afford the time to think. Tuition fee increases are a disciplinary technique, and by the time students graduate, they are not only loaded with debt, but have also internalized the disciplinarian culture. This makes them efficient components of the consumer economy.","We don\'t use the term \'working class\' here because it\'s a taboo term. You\'re supposed to say \'middle class,\' because it helps diminish the understanding that there\'s a class war going on.","Karl Marx said, \u201cThe task is not just to understand the world but to change it.\u201d A variant to keep in mind is that if you want to change the world you\u2019d better try to understand it. That doesn\u2019t mean listening to a talk or reading a book, though that\u2019s helpful sometimes. You learn from participating. You learn from others. You learn from the people you\u2019re trying to organize. We all have to gain the understanding and the experience to formulate and implement ideas.","The general public are not even aware of major decisions that will determine their fate, hence are in no position to influence them","Barack Obama is an opportunist, mostly supported by the financial institutions. He had no positions on anything. He\'s very intelligent. If you look at his program, almost no substance. Change, hope, what\'s that? I mean, he had some policies, but it was almost certain that he would give them up instantly, which he did.","The threat of China is not military. The threat of China is they can\'t be intimidated. Europe you can intimidate. When the US tries to get people to stop investing in Iran, European companies pull out, China disregards it. You look at history and understand why - they\'ve been around for 4,000 years, they have contempt for the barbarians, they just don\'t give a damn.","In our society, real power does not happen to lie in the political system, it lies in the private economy: that\u2019s where the decisions are made about what\u2019s produced, how much is produced, what\u2019s consumed, where investment takes place, who has jobs, who controls the resources, and so on and so forth. And as long as that remains the case, changes inside the political system can make some difference-I don\u2019t want to say it\u2019s zero-but the differences are going to be very slight.","It hardly takes more than a day in Gaza to begin to appreciate what it must be like to try to survive in the world\u2019s largest open-air prison.","The process of shaping opinion, attitudes, and perceptions was termed the \'engineering of consent\' by one of the founders of the modern public relations industry, Edward Bernays.","Death and genitals are things that frighten people, and when people are frightened, they develop means of concealment and aggression. It is common sense.","We are hurtling towards self-destruction at an alarming rate thanks chiefly to an advertising and propaganda system that goads people from infancy towards apathy, isolation, passivity, helplessness and separation.","Technology is basically neutral. It\'s kind of like a hammer. The hammer doesn\'t care whether you use it to build a house, or whether a torturer uses it to crush somebody\'s skull.","Optimism is a strategy for making a better future. Because unless you believe that the future can be better, you are unlikely to step up and take responsibility for making it so.","For those who stubbornly seek freedom, there can be no more urgent task than to come to understand the mechanisms and practices of indoctrination.","Religion is based on the idea that God is an imbecile.","If there are dollars to be made, you destroy the environment. The reason is elementary. The people who are going to be harmed by this are your grandchildren and they don\'t have any votes in the market. Their interests are worth zero. Anybody that pays attention to their grandchildren\'s interests is being irrational. Because what you\'re supposed to do is maximize your own interests, measured by wealth, right now. Nothing else matters. So destroying the environment and militarizing outer space are rational policies, but within a framework of institutional lunacy.","The ideal is to create a completely fragmented atomized society where everybody is totally alone, doing nothing but trying to pursue created wants, and the wants are created.","The search for truth is a cooperative, unending endeavor. We can, and should, engage in it to the extent we can and encourage others to do so as well, seeking to free ourselves from constraints imposed by coercive institutions, dogma, irrationality, excessive conformity and lack of initiative and imagination, and numerous other obstacles.","If you are working 50 hours a week in a factory, you don\'t have time to read 10 newspapers a day and go back to declassified government archives. But such people may have far-reaching insights into the way the world works.","I don\'t bother writing about Fox News. It is too easy. What I talk about are the liberal intellectuals, the ones who portray themselves and perceive themselves as challenging power, as courageous, as standing up for truth and justice. They are basically the guardians of the faith. They set the limits. They tell us how far we can go. They say, \'Look how courageous I am.\' But do not go one millimeter beyond that. At least for the educated sectors, they are the most dangerous in supporting power.","If kids are studying for a test, they\'re not going to learn anything. We all know that from our own experience.","Hillary Clinton was the one pressing the hardest for bombing, and look at what happened. They not only destroyed the country, but Libya has become the center for jihad all over Africa and the Middle East. It\'s a total disaster in every respect, but it does not matter. Look at the so-called global war on terror.","The whole intelectual culture has a filtering system, starts as a child in school. You\'re expected to accept certain beliefs, styles, behavioral patterns and so on. If you don\'t accept them, you are called maybe a behavioral problem, or something, and you\'re weeded out. Something like that goes on all the way through universities and graduate schools. There is an implicit system of filtering, which has the, it creates a strong tendency to impose conformism. Now, it\'s a tendency, so you do have exceptions, and sometimes the exceptions are quite striking.","The leading student of business propaganda, Australian social scientist Alex Carey, argues persuasively that \u201cthe 20th century has been characterized by three developments of great political importance: the growth of democracy, the growth of corporate power, and the growth of corporate propaganda as a means of protecting corporate power against democracy.","You don\'t have any other society where the educated classes are so effectively indoctrinated and controlled by a subtle propaganda system - a private system including media, intellectual opinion forming magazines and the participation of the most highly educated sections of the population. Such people ought to be referred to as \\"Commissars - for that is what their essential function is - to set up and maintain a system of doctrines and beliefs which will undermine independent thought and prevent a proper understanding and analysis of national and global institutions, issues, and policies\\".","There is a social responsibility to take care of vulnerable people. It seems that a sensible social responsibility is obligatory education, but also decent education, and that is not happening.","The US is a business-run huckster society, and its primary value is deceit.","I mean, it\u2019s true, nobody talks about them, but when you bring it up, the idea that you have to rent yourself to somebody and follow their orders, and that they own and you work there, and you built it but you don\u2019t own it, that\u2019s a highly unnatural notion. You don\u2019t have to study any complicated theories to see that this is an attack on human dignity.","On the other hand, a lot of the internet - I don\'t know the percentage, but I am sure a great mass of internet use - is pretty superficial interaction amongst people. Its not necessarily a bad thing. A teenager wants to talk to her friend, that\'s fine, but I think it probably contributes to atomization, which is a threat to the society.","That\'s unfortunately common - to blame immigrants, to blame the African-Americans who are being helped by federal programs, to blame anyone available, to direct attention away from the roots of the distress which you\'re suffering. This combines with xenophobia, white supremacy, racism, misogyny, and other quite unpleasant phenomena which are far from being eradicated. All of this makes for a pretty dangerous brew. But economic issues are right in the center of it. And you can see this in the fact that so many former Obama voters now voted for Trump, or just didn\'t bother voting.","If there had been a charismatic figure in the United States who could mobilize fears, anger, racism, a sense of loss of the future that belongs to us, this country could be in real danger. We\'re lucky that there never has been an honest, charismatic figure. McCarthy was too much of a thug, you know? Nixon was too crooked. Trump, I think, is too much of a clown. So, we\'ve been lucky.","If by \'intellectual\' you mean people who are a special class who are in the business of imposing thoughts and forming ideas for people in power, and telling people what they should believe...they\'re really more a kind of secular priesthood, whose task it is to uphold the doctrinal truths of the society. And the population SHOULD be anti-intellectual in that repect.","It\u2019s a shameful moment for U.S. media when it insists on being subservient to the grotesque propaganda agencies of a violent, aggressive state.","If there was an observer on Mars, they would probably be amazed that we have survived this long.","Growth is a funny sort of concept. For example, our GNP increases every time we build a prison. Well, okay, it\'s growth in a sense.","Ontological questions are generally beside the point, hardly more than a form of harassment.","The term \\"intellectual\\" is used conventionally to refer to people who happen to have unusual opportunities in this regard, and as always, opportunity confers moral responsibility.","All over the place, from the popular culture to the propaganda system, there is constant pressure to make people feel that they are helpless, that the only role they can have is to ratify decisions and to consume.","Unfortunately, you can\u2019t vote the rascals out, because you never voted them in, in the first place","Power is concentrated. The general policy is exactly the way that Adam Smith described it: it\'s designed for the benefit of its principal architects, the powerful. It serves \\"the vile maxim of the masters: all for ourselves and nothing for anyone else\\". Those are the basic rules of the world.","It is only in folk tales, children\'s stories, and the journals of intellectual opinion that power is used wisely and well to destroy evil. The real world teaches very different lessons, and it takes willful and dedicated ignorance to fail to perceive them.","The United States is absolutely the most dangerous country in the world.","Capitalism denies the right to live. You have only the right to remain on the labour market.","Citizens of the democratic societies should undertake a course of intellectual self defense to protect themselves from manipulation and control, and to lay the basis for meaningful democracy.","It\'s very common for the victims to understand a system better than the people who are holding the stick.","Whoever sets the agenda controls the outcome of the debate","It is a virtual reflex for governments to plead security concerns when they undertake any controversial action, often as a pretext for something else.","The worst drug of all by far is tobacco; the death toll from tobacco is just overwhelming.","I think there is a good reason why the propaganda system works that way. It recognizes that the public will not support the actual policies. Therefore it is important to prevent any knowledge or understanding of them.","The very idea that there should be a certain class of people who give orders by virtue of their ownership of wealth and another huge class who take on orders and follow them because of their lack of access to wealth and power, that\'s unacceptable. So, sure it should be abolished.","The point of advertising is to destroy markets.","I suppose frogs pay no attention to being frogs. They take it for granted. What interests a frog are differences among frogs. From our point of view they are more or less the same, from their point of view they are all radically different.","The truth of the matter is that about 99 percent of teaching is making the students feel interestedin the material. Then the other 1 percent has to do with your methods. And that\'s not just true of languages. It\'s true of every subject.","The person who wins the Nobel Prize is not the person who read the most journal articles and took the most notes on them. It\'s the person who knew what to look for. And cultivating that capacity to seek what\'s significant, always willing to question whether you\'re on the right track - that\'s what education is going to be about, whether it\'s using computers and the Internet, or pencil and paper, or books.","Propaganda is to a democracy what the bludgeon is to a totalitarian state...","There\u2019s no more morality in world affairs, fundamentally, than there was at the time of Genghis Khan.","In much of the world the U.S. is regarded as a leading terrorist state.","Three quarters of the American population literally believe in religious miracles. The numbers who believe in the devil, in resurrection, in God doing this and that - it\'s astonishing. These numbers aren\'t duplicated anywhere else in the industrial world. You\'d have to maybe go to mosques in Iran or do a poll among old ladies in Sicily to get numbers like this. Yet this is the American population.","The entire socioeconomic system is based on production for profit and a growth imperative that cannot be sustained.","Our ignorance can be divided into problems and mysteries. When we face a problem, we may not know its solution, but we have insight, increasing knowledge, and an inkling of what we are looking for. When we face a mystery, however, we can only stare in wonder and bewilderment, not knowing what an explanation would even look like.","States are not moral agents, people are, and can impose moral standards on powerful institutions.","Capitalism\u2019s concept of competitive man who seeks only to maximize wealth and power, who subjects himself to market relationships, to exploitation and external authority, is anti-human and intolerable in the deepest sense","Under capitalism, we can\'t have democracy by definition. Capitalism is a system in which the central institutions of society are in principle under autocratic control.","That was the reason why very few people fleeing the rise of fascism in Europe, especially in Germany, could get to the United States. And there were famous incidents like with the MS Saint Louis, which brought a lot of immigrants, mostly Jewish, from Europe. It reached Cuba, with people expecting to be admitted to the United States from there. But the administration of Franklin D. Roosevelt wouldn\'t allow them in and they had to go back to Europe where many of them died in concentration camps.","As long as individuals are compelled to rent themselves on the market to those who are willing to hire them, as long as their role in production is simply that of ancillary tools, then there are striking elements of coercion and oppression that make talk of democracy very limited, if even meaningful.","In the early 1940s, as a young teenager, I was utterly appalled by the racist and jingoist hysteria of the anti-Japanese propaganda. The Germans were evil, but treated with some respect: They were, after all, blond Aryan types, just like our imaginary self-image. Japanese were mere vermin, to be crushed like ants.","The costs of the Bush-Obama wars in Iraq and Afghanistan are now estimated to run as high as $4.4 trillion - a major victory for Osama bin Laden, whose announced goal was to bankrupt America by drawing it into a trap. The 2011 military budget - almost matching that of the rest of the world combined - is higher in real terms than at any time since World War II and is slated to go even higher .","Efforts can succeed over time, and not trying ensures that the worst will happen.","In a capitalist system, there\'s a principle that if you invest, especially in a long-term risky investment, if something comes out of it, you\'re supposed to get the profit. It doesn\'t happen in our system. The taxpayer paid for it and gets nothing - assumes all of the risk, gets zero. The money goes into the pockets of Bill Gates and Steve Jobs, who are ripping off decades of work in the public sector.","The corporations plainly want academic scholarship to create a web of mystification that will avoid any public awareness of the way in which power actually functions in the society, and the faculty has caught the message and they do it magnificently.","Expressing criticism of society is not being a grouch.","There are few genuine conservatives within the U.S. political system, and it is a sign of the intellectual corruption of the age that the honorable term \'conservatism\' can be appropriated to disguise the advocacy of a powerful, lawless, aggressive and violent state, a welfare state for the rich dedicated to a lunatic form of Keynesian economic intervention that enhances state and private power while mortgaging the country\'s future.","There is a reason why Nelson Mandela went to Cuba to praise Castro and thank the Cuban people almost as soon as he got out of jail. That\'s a third world reaction and they understand it. Cuba played an enormous role in the liberation of Africa and the overthrow of Apartheid, sending doctors and teachers to the poorest places in the world, to Haiti, to Pakistan after the earthquake, almost everywhere. The internationalism is just astonishing. I don\'t think there has been anything like it in history.","My own concern is primarily the terror and violence carried out by my own state... It is very easy to denounce the atrocities of someone else. That has about as much ethical value as denouncing atrocities that took place in the 18th century.","Discovery is the ability to be puzzled by simple things. Noam Chomsky","Africa\'s a wreck and it\'s not because it was hit by an asteroid. It\'s a wreck largely because it was hit by Europe.","Corporations are totalitarian institutions. Board of directors at the top of managers give orders, everyone follows orders..... At the very bottom of command, if you are lucky you can rent yourself to it and get a job , and if you are sufficiently propagandized you may even buy some of the junk they produce and so on.","People don\'t talk to each other. You\'re alone with your television set or internet. But you can\'t have a functioning democracy without what sociologists call \\"secondary organizations,\\" places where people can get together, plan, talk and develop ideas. You don\'t do it alone.","The \\"prophets\\" were what we would call dissident intellectuals. They provided critical geopolitical analysis, condemned the crimes of the powerful, called for justice and mercy for those who needed help, etc. I wouldn\'t personally endorse everything they said, any more than I would for critics of power and its crimes today. But rather generally I think they played an honorable role - and suffered accordingly.","There is no reason to believe ... that the \\"essential purpose\\" of language is \\"communication\\". Language can be used to transmit information, but it also serves many other purposes: to establish relations among people, to express or clarify thought, for play, for creative mental activity, to gain understanding, and so on. In my opinion, there is no reason to accord privileged status to one or the other of these modes.","Since Jimmy Carter, religious fundamentalists play a major role in elections. He was the first president who made a point of exhibiting himself as a born again Christian. That sparked a little light in the minds of political campaign managers: Pretend to be a religious fanatic and you can pick up a third of the vote right away. Nobody asked whether Lyndon Johnson went to church every day. Bill Clinton is probably about as religious as I am, meaning zero, but his managers made a point of making sure that every Sunday morning he was in the Baptist church singing hymns.","People have to be atomized and segregated and alone. They\'re not supposed to organize, because then they might be something beyond spectators of action. They might actually be participants if many people with limited resources could get together to enter the political arena. That\'s really threatening.","In the moral calculus of currently prevailing state capitalism, profits and bonuses in the next quarter greatly outweigh concern for the welfare of one\u2019s grandchildren, and since these are institutional maladies, they will not be easy to overcome. While much remains uncertain, we can assure ourselves, with fair confidence, that future generations will not forgive us our silence and apathy.","You can\u2019t have meaningful political democracy without functioning economic democracy.","Jesus himself, and most of the message of the Gospels, is a message of service to the poor, a critique of the rich and the powerful, and a pacifist doctrine. And it remained that way, that\'s what Christianity was up... until Constantine. :Constantine shifted it so the cross, which was the symbol of persecution of somebody working for the poor, was put on the shield of the Roman Empire. It became the symbol for violence and oppression, and that\'s pretty much what the church has been until the present.","For those who stubbornly seek freedom, there can be no more urgent task than to come to understand the mechanisms and practices of indoctrination. These are easy to perceive in the totalitarian societies, much less so in the system of \'brainwashing under freedom\' to which we are subjected and which all too often we serve as willing or unwitting instruments.","Donald Trump and Sean Spicer do one thing after another to keep the media attention focused on them. And it works. These legislative achievements are being made which are chipping away at anything the government has that\'s of any use to anybody. Paul Ryan, I think, is the most dangerous guy in the government. He knows what he\'s doing. And it\'s very systematic. I presume he\'s behind the cabinet appointments, but it\'s pretty amazing that every single cabinet appointment is somebody devoted to destroying that part of government.","Human language appears to be a unique phenomenon, without significant analogue in the animal world.","As far as Bernie Sanders is concerned, he is a decent, honest person, and I supported him. What he means by socialism is New Deal Liberalism. In fact, his actual policies would not have been a great surprise to General Eisenhower. The fact that this is called a \\"political revolution\\" is a sign of how far to the right the political spectrum has shifted, mainly in the last 30 years since the neoliberal programs began to be instituted. What he was calling for was a restoration of something like New Deal Liberalism, which is a very good thing.","The number of people killed by the sanctions in Iraq is greater than the total number of people killed by all weapons of mass destruction in all of history.","I don\'t think there is any scientific evidence about the question of whether we think only in language or not. But introspection indicates pretty clearly that we don\'t think in language necessarily. We also think in visual images, we think in terms of situations and events, and so on, and many times we can\'t even express in words what the content of our thinking is. And even if we are able to express it in words, it is a common experience to say something and then to recognize that it is not what we meant, that it is something else.","Legalizing marijuana would make a lot of sense, I don\'t think there\'s a single case of marijuana overdose on record and tens of millions of users. It\'s much less dangerous than alcohol, for example.","The current period of regression is registering some success in \\"producing people\\" who are subordinated to external power, diverted to such \\"superficial things\\" as \\"fashionable consumption\\" and other pursuits more fitting for the \\"bewildered herd\\" than participation in determining the course of individual and social life.","In the mid to late nineteenth century, the gun manufacturers recognized that they had a limited market. Remember that this is a capitalist society, you\'ve got to expand your market. They were selling guns to the military. That\'s a pretty limited market. What about all the rest of the people? So what started was all kinds of fantastic stories about Wyatt Earp and the gunmen and the Wild West, how exciting it was to have these guys with guns defending themselves against all sorts of things.","...the mass media. What are they? They\'re huge corporations, massive corporations, linked up with even bigger corporations. They sell audiences to other businesses, namely advertisers. So when you turn on the television set, CBS doesn\'t make any money. They make money from the advertisers. You\'re the product that they\'re selling, and the same is true of the daily newspaper. They\'re huge corporations, selling audiences, potential consumers, to other businesses, all linked up closely to the government, especially the big media. What picture of the world do you expect them to present?","Trump keeps the spotlight on himself with one act after another, assuming correctly that yesterday\'s antics will be swept aside by today\'s.","What\'s the purpose of NATO? Well actually we have an official answer. It isn\'t publicized much, but a couple of years ago, the secretary-general of NATO made a formal statement explaining the purpose of NATO in the post-Cold War world is to control global energy systems, pipelines, and sea lanes. That means it\'s a global system and of course he didn\'t say it, it\'s an intervention force under US command, as we\'ve seen in case after case. So that\'s NATO.","While Trump keeps the spotlight on himself, the \\"respectable\\" Republican establishment chips away at government programs that benefit the general population.","When geologists announced the beginning of a new geological epoch, the Anthropocene, humans destroying the environment, one of the main things they pointed to is the use of plastics in the earth. We don\'t think about it, but it has a tremendous effect. But these are things you don\'t see right in front of your eyes. You need to think about them a little, to see what the consequences are. It\'s easy to put them aside, and the media don\'t talk about them.","In Egypt the neoliberal programs have meant statistical growth, like right before the Arab Spring, Egypt was a kind of poster child for the World Bank and the IMF [International Monetary Fund:] the marvelous economic management and great reform. The only problem was for most of the population it was a kind of like a blow in the solar plexus: wages going down, benefits being eliminated, subsidized food gone and meanwhile, high concentration of wealth and a huge amount of corruption.","Those who wish to change the world should have the best possible understanding of the world, including what is revealed by the sciences, some of which they might be able to use for their purposes. That\'s why workers education, including science and mathematics, has commonly been a concern of left intellectuals.","From the U.S. point of view, negotiations are, in effect, a way for Israel to continue its policies of systematically taking over whatever it wants in the West Bank, maintaining the brutal siege on Gaza, separating Gaza from the West Bank and, of course, occupying the Syrian Golan heights, all with full U.S. support.","The drug problem is in the United States, not in Mexico. It\'s a demand problem and that is to be dealt with here, and it is not being dealt with. It\'s been shown over and over that prevention and treatment are far more cost effective than police action, out-of-country action, border control, and so on.","Right now, huge numbers of people cannot obtain even drinking water, and the situation is likely to become worse with predicted climate change and failure to take the actions that are necessary.","I like the cold weather. It means you get work done.","The more privilege you have, the more opportunity you have. The more opportunity you have, the more responsibility you have.","The internet, since it is publicly created, ought to be publicly controlled.","Throughout history, even the harshest and most shameful measures are regularly accompanied by professions of noble intent - and rhetoric about bestowing freedom and independence.","The people I find most impressive are generally unknown at the time of their actions and forgotten in history.","The US is a country [in which] eighty percent of the population thinks the Bible was written by god. About half think every word is literally true. So it\'s had to appeal to that - and to the nativist population, the people that are frightened, have always been... It\'s a very frightened country and that\'s increasing now with the recognition that the white population is going to be a minority pretty soon, \\"they\'ve taken our country from us.\\"","Compare mathematics and the political sciences - it\'s quite striking. In mathematics, in physics, people are concerned with what you say, not with your certification. But in order to speak about social reality, you must have the proper credentials, particularly if you depart from the accepted framework of thinking. Generally speaking, it seems fair to say that the richer the intellectual substance of a field, the less there is a concern for credentials, and the greater is the concern for content.","There is no western concern for issues of aggression, atrocities, human rights abuses and so on if there\'s a profit to be made from them","People who call themselves supporters of Israel are actually supporters of its moral degeneration and ultimate destruction.","The United States is unusual among the industrial democracies in the rigidity of the system of ideological control - \'indoctrination,\' we might say - exercised through the mass media.","Education must provide the opportunities for self-fulfillment; it can at best provide a rich and challenging environment for the individual to explore, in his own way.","Julian Assange shouldn\'t be the subject of a grand jury hearing, he should be given a medal. He\'s contributing to democracy.","Suppose that I see a hungry child in the street, and I am able to offer the child some food. Am I morally culpable if I refuse to do so? Am I morally culpable if I choose not to do what I easily can about the fact that 1000 children die every hour from easily preventable disease, according to UNICEF? Or the fact that the government of my own \\"free and open society\\" is engaged in monstrous crimes that can easily be mitigated or terminated? Is it even possible to debate these questions?","We\'re supposed to believe that oil had nothing to do with it, that if Iraq were exporting pickles or jelly and the center of world oil production were in the South Pacific that the United States would\'ve liberated them anyway. It has nothing to do with the oil, what a crass idea. Anyone with their head screwed on knows that that can\'t be true.","The responsibilities of someone in a more free and open society are, again obviously, greater than those who may pay some cost for honesty and integrity.","All media depend on advertisement to survive.","In the American Jewish community, there is little willingness to face the fact that the Palestinian Arabs have suffered a monstrous historical injustice . . . Until this is recognized, discussion of the Middle East crisis cannot even begin.","To object that the facts about human nature set limits on our ability to change the world and ourselves makes about as much sense as the lament that our lack of wings sets limits on our ability to \'fly\' as far as eagles under our own power.","We must present a national persona of being irrational and vindictive, because that\'s going to terrify people. And then, they\'ll back off. And this is not [Donald] Trump, this is [Bill] Clinton. It\'s not [Richard] Nixon, you know. We have to be irrational and vindictive, because that\'s going to frighten people.","The United States in many ways resembles a Third World country - far more elevated, but it has many of those structural characteristics: the extreme inequality of wealth, the deterioration of infrastructure because it only serves poor people, predatory operations, huge corruption, and so on.","Nicaragua dealt with the problem of terrorism in exactly the right way. It followed international law and treaty obligations. It collected evidence, brought the evidence to the highest existing tribunal, the International Court of Justice, and received a verdict - which, of course, the U.S. dismissed with contempt.","A fundamental element of human nature is the need for creative work, for creative inquiry, for free creation without the arbitrary limiting effects of coercive institutions. A decent society should maximize the possibilities for this fundamental human characteristic to be realized.","The US is the wrecking machine that is destroying everything. The world is hoping that China will somehow come to the rescue.","Our health care is rationed by wealth.","There is massive propaganda for everyone to consume. Consumption is good for profits and consumption is good for the political establishment.","Now take a look at the way the Drug War is conducted over the past 40 years. It goes back farther, but start from 40 years ago: There\'s very little spent on prevention and treatment. There\'s a lot on policing, a ton of stuff on border control and a lot on out-of-country operations. And the effect on the availability of drugs is almost undetectable; drug prices don\'t change on measures of availability. So there are two possibilities: Either those conducting the Drug War are lunatics, or they have another purpose.","As long as people are marginalized and distracted [they] have no way to organize or articulate their sentiments, or even know that others have these sentiments. People assume that they are the only people with a crazy idea in their heads. They never hear it from anywhere else. Nobody\'s supposed to think that. ... Since there\'s no way to get together with other people who share or reinforce that view and help you articulate it, you feel like an oddity, an oddball. So you just stay on the side and you don\'t pay any attention to what\'s going on. You look at something else, like the Superbowl.","Sports plays a societal role in engendering jingoist and chauvinist attitudes. They\'re designed to organize a community to be committed to their gladiators.","Wanton killing of innocent civilians is terrorism, not a war against terrorism.","There was a free election in Palestine, but it came out the wrong way. So instantly, the United States and Israel with Europe tagging along, moved to punish the Palestinian people, and punish them harshly, because they voted the wrong way in a free election. That\'s accepted here in the West as perfectly normal. That illustrates the deep hatred and contempt for democracy among western elites, so deep-seated they can\'t even perceive it when it\'s in front of their eyes. You punish people severely if they vote the wrong way in a free election.","Nothing is more inspiring to see how poor and suffering people, living under conditions incomparably worse than we endure, continue quietly and unpretentiously with courageous and committed struggle for justice and dignity.","The government has a defect: it\'s potentially democratic. Corporations have no defect: they\'re pure tyrannies.","Nicaragua was destabilizing Central America, meaning moving in a direction the US didn\'t like. So Nicaragua was crushed.","The US has been the leading terrorist state in the world for many years.","I think the use of language is a very important means by which this species, because of its biological nature, creates a kind of social space, to place itself in interactions with other people. It doesn\'t have much to do with communication in a narrow sense; that is, it doesn\'t involve transmission of information. There is much information transmitted but it is not the content of what is said that is transmitted.","It\'s perfectly obvious that there is some genetic factor that distinguishes humans from other animals and that it is language-specific. The theory of that genetic component, whatever it turns out to be, is what is called universal grammar.","Human language is nothing like the signalling systems of other animals.","We use the official definitions of terrorism. The definitions in the U.S. code, in British law, in U.S. Army manuals and so on. And if you use those definitions it follows instantly that the United States is the leading terrorist state in the world.","The United States has done some very good things in the world, and that does not change the fact that the World Court was quite correct in condemning the United States as an international terrorist state.","To speak truth to power is not a particularly honorable vocation. One should seek out an audience that matters - and furthermore (another important qualification), it should not be seen as an audience, but as a community of common concern in which one hopes to participate constructively.","By a generative grammar I mean simply a system of rules that in some explicit and well-defined way assigns structural descriptions to sentences. Obviously, every speaker of a language has mastered and internalized a generative grammar that expresses his knowledge of his language. This is not to say that he is aware of the rules of the grammar or even that he can become aware of them, or that his statements about his intuitive knowledge of the language are necessarily accurate.","The Bible is one of the most genocidal books in history.","Israel uses sophisticated attack jets and naval vessels to bomb densely-crowded refugee camps, schools, apartment blocks, mosques, and slums to attack a population that has no air force, no air defense, no navy, no heavy weapons, no artillery units, no mechanized armor, no command in control, no army and calls it a war.","Look at the ozone story. As long as it was the southern hemisphere that was being threatened, there was very little talk about it. When it was discovered in the north, very quickly actions were taken to do something about it. Right now there\'s discussion of putting serious effort into developing a malaria vaccine, because global warming might extend malaria to the rich countries, so something should be done about it.","There was a really monstrous and almost literal genocide in the Mayan area, specifically under R\xedos Montt. By now it has been recognized somewhat by Guatemalan society. In fact, Montt was under trial for some crimes. But the U.S. prohibits people from fleeing here.","There is kind of a fundamental conformity, which is a virtual requirement to enter into the media.","Technology provides means for expression and interchange and so on, so yes it should be free and open, but there are a lot of constraints on how its used.","In this possibly terminal phase of human existence, democracy and freedom are more than just ideals to be valued - they may be essential to survival.","You never really saw the racism in Europe in the past because it was so homogeneous. When everyone is blonde and blue-eyed, you don\'t see racism. But as soon as there was the beginnings of immigration, it just came out very dramatically.","Concision is a technique of propaganda. It ensures you cannot do anything except repeat clich\xe9s, the standard doctrine, or sound like a lunatic.","Every predecessor has used mercenaries, often drawn from the country that they\'re attacking like England ran India with Indian mercenaries. You take them from one place and send them to kill people in the other place. That\'s the standard way to run imperial wars.","You go into a hospital now, it\'s dangerous. We can get diseases that can\'t be dealt with, that are moving around the hospital. A lot of that traces back to industrial meat production. These are really serious threats, all over the place.","There has to be spiritual transformation among the masses, who have to be willing to recognize that their oppression is not a law of nature. That\'s what Latin American bishops were doing when they formed base communities. They were trying to get peasants to recognize that you can take your fate into your own hands. That\'s what the civil-rights movement did here. That\'s what the women\'s movement did.","Concentration of ownership in the media is high and increasing. Furthermore, those who occupy managerial positions in the media, or gain status within them as commentators, belong to the same privileged elites, and might be expected to share the perceptions, aspirations and attitudes of their associates, reflecting their own class interests as well.","There are massive efforts on the part of the internet\'s corporate owners to try to direct it to become a technique of marginalisation and control.","Today, the danger of some sort of a nuclear catastrophe is greater than it was during the Cold War, and most people are blissfully unaware of this danger.","The uniformity and obedience of the media, which any dictator would admire...","Bear in mind that we [ with Edward Herman] did not devise the terms \\"manufacture of consent\\" and \\"engineering of consent.\\" We borrowed them from leading figures in the media, public relations industry, and academic scholarship.","It\'s necessary to address the concerns and beliefs of those who are taken in by the fraud, or who don\'t recognize the nature and significance of the issues for other reasons. If by philosophy we mean reasoned and thoughtful analysis, then it can address the moment, though not by confronting the \\"alternative facts\\" but by analyzing and clarifying what is at stake, whatever the issue is. Beyond that, what is needed is action: urgent and dedicated, in the many ways that are open to us.","Whenever there is injustice, oppression, aggression, violence, it\'s standard for it to be supported by those we now call \\"intellectuals,\\" but typically not by all; there is typically a fringe of dissidents. With very rare exceptions - in fact, it\'s hard to think of any - they suffer in one or another way; how depends on the nature of the society.","The first modern propaganda agency was the British Ministry of Information a century ago, which secretly defined its task as \\"to direct the thought of most of the world\\" - primarily progressive American intellectuals, who had to be mobilized to come to the aid of Britain during World War I.","When people say do you believe in God? what do they mean by it? Do I believe in some spiritual force in the world? In a way, yes. People have thoughts, emotions. If you want to call that a spiritual force, okay. But unless there\'s some clarification of what we\'re supposed to believe in or disbelieve in, I can\'t answer.","I have often thought that if a rational Fascist dictatorship were to exist, then it would choose the American system.","The actual consequences of Plan Colombia are to devastate peasant communities, which have been driven to drug production. These peasants have no particular desire to grow coca, but their other means of livelihood have been wiped out.","Democracy, in the United States rhetoric refers to a system of governance in which elite elements based in the business community control the state by virtue of their dominance of the private society, while the population observes quietly. So understood, democracy is a system of elite decision and public ratification, as in the United States itself. Correspondingly, popular involvement in the formation of public policy is considered a serious threat. It is not a step towards democracy; rather it constitutes a \'crisis of democracy\' that must be overcome.","I don\'t have any oratory skills. But I would not use them if I had.","The internet is something created largely by public funding.","There is a phrase in trade theory; it\'s called \\"kicking away the ladder.\\" First you violate the rules - the market rules - and then by the time you succeed in developing, you kick away the ladders so others can\'t do it too, and you preach about \\"free trade.\\"","There have been many measures taken to try to turn the educational system towards more control, more indoctrination, more vocational training, imposing a debt, which traps students and young people into a life of conformity... That\'s the exact opposite of [what] traditionally comes out of The Enlightenment. And there\'s a constant struggle between those. In the colleges, in the schools, do you train for passing tests, or do you train for creative inquiry?","My suspicion is that those who seem oblivious to suffering, whether it is nearby or in remote corners, are for the most part unaware, perhaps blinded by doctrine and ideology. For them, the answer is to develop a critical attitude toward articles of faith, secular or religious; to encourage their capacity to question, to explore, to view the world from the standpoint of others. And direct exposure is never very far away, wherever we live - perhaps the homeless person huddling in the cold or asking for a few pennies for food, or all too many more.","Language is a process of free creation; its laws and principles are fixed, but the manner in which the principles of generation are used is free and infinitely varied. Even the interpretation and use of words involves a process of free creation.","Ever since I\'ve had any political awareness, I\'ve felt either alone or part of a tiny minority.","The US stole Texas from Mexico by violence, then invaded Mexico on ludicrous pretexts and conquered half of it, what is now the Southwest and Far West. That\'s why cities have Spanish names: San Francisco, Los Angeles, San Diego, Santa Cruz, etc. All of this is suppressed in standard American history. But the victims remember. The conquerors typically have one history, the victims a different one - and often a more accurate one.","The people we call the prophets I think are the earliest dissident intellectuals, and they\'re treated like most dissident intellectuals - very badly. They\'re imprisoned, driven into the desert. King Ahab, the epitome of evil in the Bible, condemned Elijah as a \\"hater of Israel.\\" This is the first self-hating Jew, the origin of the term. It goes right up to the present. That\'s the history of intellectuals.","The US and Israel have demanded further that Palestinians not only recognize Israel\'s rights as a state in the international system, but that they also recognize Israel\'s abstract right to exist, a concept that has no place in international law or diplomacy, and a right claimed by no one. In effect, the US and Israel are demanding that Palestinians . . . formally accept the legitimacy of their expulsion from their own land. They cannot be expected to accept that, just as Mexico does not grant the US the right to exist on half of Mexico\'s territory, gained by conquest.","As long as nuclear weapons exist, the chances of survival of the human species are quite slight.","In fact, what were called the socialist countries in Eastern Europe were the most anti-socialist systems in the world. Workers had more rights in the United States and England than they had in Russia, and it was somehow still called socialism.","The fact is that if you have not developed language, you simply don\'t have access to most of human experience, and if you don\'t have access to experience, then you\'re not going to be able to think properly.","If [Respulicans] can\'t get rid of [Obamacare], they\'re going to have to tell their base, we\'ve been lying to you for the last five years. So they\'re willing to go to almost any extent to do that. That\'s unusual, in fact I think it\'s unique in the history of modern parliamentary systems. And it\'s very dangerous for the country and for the world.","Suppose that, say, China established military bases in Colombia to carry out chemical warfare in Kentucky and North Carolina to destroy this lethal crop [tobacco] that is killing huge numbers of Chinese.","It is familiar to mainstream academic scholarship. One very prominent political scientist, in his standard text American Politics 20 years ago, observes that \\"The architects of power in the United States must create a force that can be felt but not seen.\\"","It\'s a class war, and a war on young people too... that\'s why tuition is rising so rapidly. There\'s no real economic reason for that. It\'s a technique of control and indoctrination. And this is really the first organized, significant reaction to it, which is important.","Intellectuals are in a position to expose the lies of governments, to analyze actions according to their causes and motives and often hidden intentions.","Tough love is just the right phrase: love for the rich and privileged, tough for everyone else.","That\'s a point that Dan Ellsberg has made for years. He said it\'s kind of like if you and I go into a grocery store to rob it, and I have a gun. The guy may give you the money in the cash register. I\'m using the gun even if I don\'t shoot. Well that\'s nuclear weapons - essential to post-war deterrence - they cast a shadow over everything.","[Mikhail] Gorbachev complained. He was told look, there\'s nothing on paper. People didn\'t actually say it but the implication was look, if you are dumb enough to take faith in a gentleman\'s agreement with us, that\'s your problem. NATO expanded to East Germany.","The internet could be a very positive step towards education, organisation and participation in a meaningful society.","Biblical archaeology was developed early in this century in an effort to substantiate the authenticity of the Biblical account. It\'s by now generally recognized in Biblical scholarship that it has done the opposite. The Bible is not a historical text, and has only vague resemblances to what took place, as far as can be reconstructed. For example, whether Israel ever existed is not clear; if so, it was probably a small kingdom somewhere in the hills, apparently virtually unknown to the Egyptians.","Before the 1970s, banks were banks. They did what banks were supposed to do in a state capitalist economy: they took unused funds from your bank account, for example, and transferred them to some potentially useful purpose like helping a family buy a home or send a kid to college.","The free market is \'socialism\' for the rich: the public pays the costs and the rich get the benefit - markets for the poor and plenty of state protection for the rich.","It happened: the first 9/11, it happened on September 11, 1973, in Chile. We did it. Was that interfering or hacking a party? This record is all over the world, constantly overthrowing governments, invading, forcing people to follow what we call democracy, as in the cases I mentioned. As I say, if every charge is accurate, it\'s a joke, and I\'m sure half the world is collapsing in laughter about this, because people outside the United States know it. You don\'t have to tell people in Chile about the first 9/11.","If something is right (or wrong) for us, it\u2019s right (or wrong) for others. It follows that if it\u2019s wrong for Cuba, Nicaragua, Haiti, and a long list of others to bomb Washington and New York, then it\u2019s wrong for Rumsfeld to bomb Afghanistan (on much flimsier pretexts), and he should be brought before war crimes trials.","There\'s an internal coherence and logic to what they get from [Rush] Limbaugh, Glenn Beck, and the rest of these guys. And they sound very convincing, they\'re very self-confident, and they have an answer to everything - a crazy answer, but it\'s an answer. And it\'s our fault if that goes on. So one thing to be done is don\'t ridicule these people, join them, and talk about their real grievances and give them a sensible answer, like, \\"Take over your factories.\\"","I think this country and the world would be far better off if the US is not an outlaw state.","Science is a bit like the joke about the drunk who is looking under a lamppost for a key that he has lost on the other side of the street, because that\'s where the light is. It has no other choice.","In the years of the Reagan-Bush administration alone, about 1.5 million people were killed by South Africa just in the surrounding countries. Forget what was happening in South Africa and Namibia.","For example, when my father was able to buy a secondhand car in the late 1930s, and he took us to the countryside for a weekend, if we looked for a motel to stay in we had to see if it said \\"restricted\\" on it. \\"Restricted\\" meant no Jews.","Now, you ban not the whole Muslim world. You ban seven states, seven states that have not been responsible for a single terrorist act. Those are the seven [Donald Trump] banned. But, you leave the ones that really are responsible, like Saudi Arabia, which is the center for propaganda and funding and so on for radical Islamic Jihadism, well you can\'t touch them because of business interests, also they have oil and so on and so forth.","I had relatives in New York City who I stayed with. And in those days, the area from Union Square down Fourth Avenue had small bookstores, many of which were run by Spanish immigrants who\'d fled after [Francisco] Franco\'s victory. I spent time in them, and also in the offices of Freie Arbeiter Stimme (Free Worker\'s Voice) with anarchists. I picked up a lot of material and talked to people, and it became a major influence.","Our current prison state has the dual effect of getting rid of a superfluous population of basically unskilled workers (with a close race-class correlation), and also demonizing them... The drug war is basically for this - It has nothing to do with drugs, but it has plenty to do with criminalizing an unwanted population and scaring everybody else.","In fact, by universal grammar I mean just that system of principles and structures that are the prerequisites for acquisition of language, and to which every language necessarily conforms.","[Francisco] Franco\'s army was mainly Moorish. They were recruiting people from Morocco to come to Spain. There was an uprising in Morocco at the time led by Abd el-Krim (whose tactics influenced Ho Chi Minh and Che Guevara) that sought independence for Morocco and Northern Africa.","We naturally assume that our mental structures are universal. But I suppose an outside biologist looking at us would see something very different. He would see that, like other organisms, we have a narrow sphere within which we are very good, but that sphere is very limited. And that, in fact, the very achievements we can have within that sphere are related to lack of achievements in other spheres.","Going back to why people don\'t vote, I presume the main reason is because they understand without reading political science texts that it doesn\'t make any difference how they vote. It\'s not going to affect policy, so why bother?","Predatory capitalism created a complex industrial system and an advanced technology; it permitted a considerable extension of democratic practice and fostered certain liberal values, but within limits that are now being pressed and must be overcome. It is not a fit system for the mid-twentieth century.","There is a principle of human affairs that goes back millennia, which is that you don\'t look in the mirror. You can trace this principle back to the Bible. The designated intellectuals of that time are called prophets, which is a mistranslation of a Hebrew word, but they were basically intellectuals, giving geopolitical analysis, criticizing the moral practice of leadership, etc. Now, these people were not treated very nicely. There were other intellectuals who were treated nicely, namely those who centuries later came to be called false prophets. These were the flatterers of the court.","If the mutation is partially transmitted to offspring, they too would have the advantage. And over time it might have come to dominate a small breeding group.","I mean you look back at American history and American culture, it\'s pretty striking. I mean this has been the safest country in the world forever, and the most frightened country in the world.","Stability is when the U.K. and U.S. invade a country and impose the regime of their choice.","By accident of geography, the world\'s major oil resources are in Shi\'ite-dominated areas. Iran\'s oil is concentrated right near the gulf, which happens to be an Arab area, not Persian. Khuzestan is Arab, has been loyal to Iran, fought with Iran not Iraq during the Iran-Iraq war. This is a potential source of dissension. I would be amazed if there isn\'t an attempt going on to stir up secessionist elements in Khuzestan.","The new crimes that the US and Israel were committing in Gaza as 2009 opened do not fit easily into any standard category\u2014except for the category of familiarity.","There are major efforts being made to dismantle Social Security, the public schools, the post office - anything that benefits the population has to be dismantled. Efforts against the U.S. Postal Service are particularly surreal.","Public opinion can be influential, the media can be influential.","Suppose that the US really is trying to get rid of drugs in Colombia. Does Colombia then have the right to fumigate tobacco farms in Kentucky? They are producing a lethal substance far more dangerous than cocaine. More Colombians die from tobacco-related illnesses than Americans die from cocaine. Of course, Colombia has no right to do that.","Remember that in any major nuclear war, the first strike destroys the country that attacks; it\'s been known for years. The first strike of a major power is very likely to cause what\'s called nuclear winter, leads to global famine for years and everything\'s basically gone. Some survivors straggling around. Could [Donald Trump] do it? Who knows.","We can try to gain some of the sensibility of some of the indigenous populations of the world or our predecessors 800 years ago. We can laugh at them as being naive and unsophisticated, but unless we can gain that sensibility that there has to be rights of nature as Bolivians and others put it, then we\'re going to be destroyed.","Real popular culture is folk art - coalminers\' songs and so forth.","If the US were to attack North Korea, they\'d certainly destroy North Korea, but South Korea would be pretty well wiped out too.","The main purpose of advertising is to undermine markets. If you go to graduate school and you take a course in economics, you learn that markets are systems in which informed consumers make rational choices. That\'s what\'s so wonderful about it. But that\'s the last thing that the state corporate system wants. It is spending huge sums to prevent that.","Technology is usually fairly neutral. It\u2019s like a hammer, which can be used to build a house or to destroy someone\u2019s home. The hammer doesn\u2019t care. It is almost always up to us to determine whether the technology is good or bad.","But on the other hand, in discussion and debate concerning social issues or American foreign policy, Vietnam or the Middle East, for example, the issue is constantly raised, often with considerable venom. I\'ve repeatedly been challenged on grounds of credentials, or asked, what special training do you have that entitles you to speak of these matters. The assumption is that people like me, who are outsiders from a professional viewpoint, are not entitled to speak on such things.","Let\'s imagine again an observer looking at us without any preconceptions. I think he would be struck by the fact that although human beings have the capacity to develop scientific knowledge, it must be a very limited capacity because it is only done in very narrow and specific domains.","During the 1960s, large groups of people who are normally passive and apathetic began to try to enter the political arena to press their demands.... The naive might call that democracy, but that\'s because they don\'t understand. The sophisticated understand that that\'s the crisis of democracy.","In studying language we can discover many basic properties of this cognitive structure, its organization, and also the genetic predispositions that provide the foundation for its development. So in this respect, linguistics, first of all, tries to characterize a major feature of human cognitive organization. And second, I think it may provide a suggestive model for the study of other cognitive systems. And the collection of these systems is one aspect of human nature.","Another problem is the confrontation with India. Pakistan just cannot survive if it continues to do so (continue this confrontation).","Do I believe in God? Can\'t answer, I\'m afraid. I\'m not being flippant, but I don\'t understand the question. What is it that I am supposed to believe or not believe in? Are you asking whether I believe there is something not in the universe (or the universes, if there are (maybe infinitely) many of them), and that somehow stands above them? I\'ve never heard of any reason for believing that.","When I was a boy, we were the only Jewish family in a terribly anti-Semitic neighborhood. Those streets weren\'t any fun for us but our parents never found that out. In a way, you avoid telling your parents what happened to you during those days.","Even Stalin proclaimed his love for democracy. We do not learn about the nature of systems of power by listening to their rhetoric.","It\'s quite extraordinary to hear a supposedly learned person call the United States a leading terrorist nation, one of the leading terrorist nations in the world. It\'s false and very treacherous teaching.","Anarcho-capitalism, in my opinion, is a doctrinal system which, if ever implemented, would lead to forms of tyranny and oppression that have few counterparts in human history. There isn\'t the slightest possibility that its (in my view, horrendous) ideas would be implemented, because they would quickly destroy any society that made this colossal error. The idea of \'free contract\' between the potentate and his starving subject is a sick joke, perhaps worth some moments in an academic seminar exploring the consequences of (in my view, absurd) ideas, but nowhere else.","America has always been the richest and most secure, and sometimes the most dangerous country in the world. In the early years, the danger was to everybody near us, slaves, Native Americans, Mexicans. It finally expanded in 1898 to the Caribbean, Cuba, Puerto Rico, Hawaii, and the Philippines.","If you\'re worried about the deficit, pay attention to the fact that it\'s almost all attributable to military spending and the totally dysfunctional health program.","NAFTA was much more popular among US corporations than GATT, because NAFTA is highly protectionist in ways that GATT is not.","To say that the United States has pursued diplomacy with North Korea is a little bit misleading. It did under the Clinton administration, though neither side completely lived up to their obligations. Clinton didn\'t do what was promised, nor did North Korea, but they were making progress. So when Bush came into the presidency, North Korea had enough uranium or plutonium for maybe one or two bombs, but then very limited missile capacity. During the Bush years it\'s exploded. The reason is, he immediately canceled the diplomacy and he\'s pretty much blocked it ever since.","Obama\'s primary constituency was financial institutions. They were the core of the funding for his campaign. They expect to be paid back. And they were. They were paid back by coming out richer and more powerful than they were before the crisis that they created.","[CIA manipulating] has its roots in internal Pakistani affairs. It\'s a horrible development and phenomenon which goes back to radical Islamisation under Zia and taking away the long standing rights of people in the tribal areas [who were left largely alone].","Bradley Manning should be regarded as a hero. He is doing what an honest, decent citizen should be doing: letting your population know what the government, the people who rule you are doing. They want to keep it secret of course.","Greece, alone, is in a very vulnerable position. If the Greeks had had support from progressive left and popular forces elsewhere in Europe they might have been able to resist the demands of the Troika, but they had almost no support. Not even from Portugal, Spain, or other left forces. They were left alone.","The Obama administration is dedicated to increasing terrorism. In fact, he is doing it all over the world. Obama is running the biggest terrorist operation that exists, maybe in history. The drone assassination campaigns - which are just part of the special forces operations and so on - all of these operations are terror operations.","In the 1960s, various parts of the population became energized and began to enter the public arena to call for the rights of women, students, young people, old people, farmers and workers. What are called \\"special interests\\" - meaning the whole population - they began to press to enter the public arena. And they said that puts too much pressure on the state and therefore we have to have more moderation in democracy and they should go back and be quiet and obedient.","Censorship is never over for those who have experienced it. It is a brand on the imagination that affects the individual who has suffered it, forever.","As for academics, I do not see why their responsibilities as moral agents should differ in principle from the responsibilities of others; in particular, others who also enjoy a degree of privilege and power, and therefore have the responsibilities that are conferred by those advantages.","There\'s an interesting question, whether the anarchists had alternatives [in Spain]. If they did tend to support the government that had been destroyed, what were the alternatives? There was actually a proposal by Camillo Berneri, an Italian anarchist who was in Spain at the time, which is not a crazy notion in my opinion. He opposed participation in government and was against the formation of an army, meaning a major army to fight [Francisco] Franco.","In the Occupied Territories, what Israel is doing is much worse than apartheid. The South African Nationalists needed the black population. That was their workforce. The Israeli relationship to the Palestinians in the Occupied Territories is totally different. They just don\u2019t want them.","If there are lessons to be drawn from the sciences, then that should be the concern of everyone, including scientists to the extent that they can make a contribution.","The crimes committed against the people of West Papua are some of the most shameful of the past years. The Western powers have much to answer for, and at the very least should use their ample means to bring about the withdrawal of the occupying Indonesian army and termination of the shameful exploitation of resources and destruction of the environment and the lives and societies of the people of West Papua, who have suffered far too much.","There have, for years, been comparative studies of religious fanaticism and factors that correlate with it. By and large, it tends to decline with increasing industrialization and education. The US, however, is off the chart, ranking near devastated peasant societies. About 1/2 the population believe the world was created a few thousand years ago: the justification for the belief is that that is what they were ordered to believe by authority figures to whom they were taught one must subordinate oneself. And on, and on.","Take a look at the bombing of Serbia in 1999. The US was quite open about the reasons for the bombing. A main reason was to preserve stability and credibility. Serbia was interfering with stability, meaning that it was the one part of the Balkans that was not integrated into the Western-dominated (mostly US-dominated) system.","Some may remember, if you have good memories, that there used to be a concept in Anglo-American law called a presumption of innocence, innocent until proven guilty in a court of law. Now that\'s so deep in history that there\'s no point even bringing it up, but it did once exist.","Anti-union propaganda has been considerably more successful here [ in the U.S.] than in Europe, even among working people who would benefit [from] unions.","Activism spawned by Sanders campaign is beginning to make inroads into electoral politics. Under Barack Obama, the Democratic Party pretty much collapsed at the crucial local and state levels, but it can be rebuilt and turned into a progressive force. That would mean reviving the New Deal legacy and moving well beyond, instead of abandoning, the working class and turning into Clintonite New Democrats, which more or less resemble what used to be called moderate Republicans, a category that has largely disappeared with the shift of both parties to the right during the neoliberal period.","Take any country that has laws against hate crimes, inspiring hatred and genocide and so on. The first thing they would do is ban the Old Testament. There\'s nothing like it in the literary canon that exalts genocide, to that extent. And it\'s not a joke either. Like where I live, New England, the people who liberated it from the native scourge were religious fundamentalist lunatics, who came waving the holy book, declaring themselves to be the children of Israel who are killing the Amalekites, like God told them.","The murder of Lumumba, in which the U.S. was involved, in the Congo destroyed Africa\'s major hope for development. Congo is now total horror story, for years.","Anarchism, in my view, is an expression of the idea that the burden of proof is always on those who argue that authority and domination are necessary. They have to demonstrate, with powerful argument, that that conclusion is correct. If they cannot, then the institutions they defend should be considered illegitimate. How one should react to illegitimate authority depends on circumstances and conditions: there are no formulas.","If the principle is, \\"Let\'s not get lethal substances out to the public\\", the first one you\'d go after is tobacco. The next one you\'d go after is alcohol. Way down the list you\'d get to cocaine, and sort of invisibly low you\'d get to marijuana.","The Bush administration has created an unimaginable catastrophe in Iraq. This should\'ve been one of the easiest military occupations in history and they succeeded in turning it into one of the worst military disasters in history. They can\'t control it and it\'s almost impossible for them to get out for reasons you can\'t discuss in the United States because to discuss the reasons why they can\'t get out would be to concede the reasons why they invaded.","[Antonio] Gramsci\'s words and actions explain their assessment, though I think we should refrain from using the term \\"model intellectual\\" for him or others.","I think it only makes sense to seek out and identify structures of authority, hierarchy, and domination in every aspect of life, and to challenge them; unless a justification for them can be given, they are illegitimate, and should be dismantled, to increase the scope of human freedom.","Resistance is feasible even for those who are not heroes by nature, and it is an obligation, I believe, for those who fear the consequences and detest the reality of the attempt to impose American hegemony.","One of the Christian fundamentalists\' goals seems to be to rebuild the Temple, which means destroying the Al-Aqsa Mosque, which presumably means war with the Arab world - one of the goals, perhaps, in fulfilling the prophecy of Armageddon. So they strongly support Israeli power and expansionism, and help fund it and lobby for it; but they also support actions that are very harmful and objectionable to most of its population - as do Jewish fundamentalist groups, mostly rooted in the US, which, after all, is one of the most extreme religious fundamentalist societies in the world.","South Africa, with US support, after the fall of the Portuguese empire, invaded Angola and Mozambique to establish their own puppet regime there. They were trying to protect Namibia, to protect apartheid, and nobody did much about it; but the Cubans sent forces, and furthermore they sent black soldiers and they defeated a white mercenary army, which not only rescued Angola but it sent a shock throughout the continent-it was a psychic shock-white mercenaries were purported to be invincible, and a black army defeated them and sent them back fleeing into South Africa.","I\'ve often been struck by the extensive knowledge that people have of sports, and particularly, their self-confidence in discussing it with experts. . . . In contrast, when discussing matters of concern to human lives - their own and others - people tend to defer to experts.","The most striking aspect of linguistic competence is what we may call the \'creativity of language,\' that is, the speaker\'s ability to produce new sentences, sentences that are immediately UNDERSTOOD by other speakers although they bear no physical resemblance to sentences which are \'familiar.","The elections are run by the same guys who sell toothpaste. They show you an image of a sports hero, or a sexy model, or a car going up a sheer cliff or something, which has nothing to do with the commodity, but it\'s intended to delude you into picking this one rather than another one.","If you go back a century in Europe, all over the place people were speaking different languages. There were dozens of languages in France and Italy, and they\'re all called French [and Italian], but they were not mutually comprehensible. They were different languages. And they have mostly disappeared in the last century or so. Some are being preserved, like Welsh, some are being revived, like Basque or Catelan to some extent. There are plenty of people in Europe who can\'t talk to their grandmother because they talk a different language.","Bolivia is a striking example. The mostly white, Europeanized elite, which is a minority, happens to be sitting on most of the hydrocarbon reserves. For the first time Bolivia is becoming democratic. So it\'s therefore bitterly hated by the West, which despises democracy, because it\'s much too dangerous.","The death penalty can be tolerated only by extreme statist reactionaries who demand a state that is so powerful that it has the right to kill.","Anarchists try to identify power structures. They urge those exercising power to justify themselves. This justification does not succeed most of the time.","In fact, it\'s doing it all over the world. Obama, first of all, is running the biggest terrorist operation that exists, maybe in history. The drone assassination campaigns, which are just part of it. All of these operations, they are terror operations.","Labor  #\u200e Unions  are the leading force for  #\u200e democratization   and  #\u200e progress  .","The only justification for repressive institutions is material and cultural deficit. But such institutions, at certain stages of history, perpetuate and produce such a deficit, and even threaten human survival.","The one state/two state debate is irrelevant as Israel and the US consolidate Greater Israel.","It\'s only terrorism if they do it to us. When we do much worse to them, it\'s not terrorism.","The Bolshevik revolution was a counter-revolution. Its first moves were to destroy and eliminate every socialist tendency that had developed in the pre-revolutionary period. Their goal was as they said; it wasn\'t a big secret. They regarded the Soviet Union as sort a backwater. They were orthodox Marxists, expecting a revolution in Germany. They moved toward what they themselves called \\"state capitalism,\\" then they moved on to Stalinism. They called it democracy and called it socialism. The one claim was as ludicrous as the other.","The country was founded on the principle that primary role of government is to protect property from the majority, and so it remains.","The respected intellectuals are those who conform and serve power interests.","Freedom without opportunity is a devil\'s gift, and the refusal to provide such opportunities is criminal","People are dangerous.  If they\'re able to involve themselves in issues that matter, they may change the distribution of power, to the detriment of those who are rich and privileged.","In the humanities and social sciences, and in fields like journalism and economics and so on, people have to be trained to be managers, and controllers, and to accept things, and not to question too much.","American decline is real, though the apocalyptic vision reflects the familiar ruling class perception that anything short of total control amounts to total disaster.","On humanitarian intervention in general, I guess my view is not unlike the view that was attributed to Gandhi, accurately or not, when he was supposedly asked what he thought about western civilization. He is supposed to have said that he thought it would be a good idea. Similarly, humanitarian intervention would be a good idea, in principle.","States are violent to the extent that they have the power to act in the interests of those with domestic power","We need not stride resolutely towards catastrophe, merely because those are the marching orders.","I mean, what\'s the elections? You know, two guys, same background, wealth, political influence, went to the same elite university, joined the same secret society where you\'re trained to be a ruler - they both can run because they\'re financed by the same corporate institutions.","Passivity may be the easy course, but it is hardly the honorable one.","In any institution-factory, university, health center, or whatever-there are a variety of interests that ought to be represented in decision-making: the work force itself, the community in which it is located, users of its products or services, institutions that compete for the same resources. These interests should be directly represented in democratic structures that displace and eliminate private ownership of the means of production or resources, an anachronism with no legitimacy.","As soon as questions of will or decision or reason or choice of action arise, human science is at a loss.","...dissent, protest, presures of a wide variety that escape elite control can modify the calculus of costs of planners, and offer a slight hope that Washington can be compelled to permit at least some steps towards \\"justice, freedom and democracy\\" within its domains.","The beauty of our system is that it isolates everybody. Each person is sitting alone in front of the tube, you know. It\'s very hard to have ideas or thoughts under those circumstances. You can\'t fight the world alone.","Very commonly substances are criminalized because they\'re associated with what\'s called the dangerous classes, you know, poor people, or working people.... Actually, the peak of marijuana use was as I said, in the seventies, but that was rich kids, so you don\'t throw them in jail. And then it got seriously criminalized, you know, you really throw people in jail for it, when it was poor people.","I think a decent society should protect rights to private property within limits, but not concentrations of private power that infringe on the freedom and rights of others, including exploitation of labor, and that convert any democratic forms into what have been called sometimes \\"hierarchical democracies,\\" like ours, in which some have vastly greater influence over public policy than others. Spelling all of this out is a complex matter that raises many issue and problems that are impossible to address here.","The term \'globalisation\' is conventionally used to refer to the specific form of investor-rights integration designed by wealth and power, for their own interests.","In Europe there\'s an dangerous growth of ultra xenophobia which is pretty threatening to any one who remembers the history of Europe... and an attack on the remnants of the welfare state. It\'s hard to interpret the austerity-in-the-midst-of-recession policy as anything other than attack on the social contract.","If you look at history, even recent history, you see that there is indeed progress. . . . Over time, the cycle is clearly, generally upwards. And it doesn\'t happen by laws of nature. And it doesn\'t happen by social laws. . . . It happens as a result of hard work by dedicated people who are willing to look at problems honestly, to look at them without illusions, and to go to work chipping away at them, with no guarantee of success \u2014 in fact, with a need for a rather high tolerance for failure along the way, and plenty of disappointments.","There are very deep and restrictive principles that determine the nature of human language and are rooted in the specific character of the human mind","The US is to an unusual extent a business-run society, where short-term concerns of profit and market share displace rational planning.","People will find some ways of identifying themselves, becoming associated with others, taking part in something. They\'re going to do it some way or other. If they don\'t have the options of participation in labor unions, political organizations that actually function, they\'ll find other ways. Religious fundamentalism is a classic example.","A drone strike is a terror weapon, we don\'t talk about it that way. It is; just imagine you are walking down the street and you don\'t know whether in 5 minutes there is going to be an explosion across the street from some place up in the sky that you can\'t see. Somebody will be killed, and whoever is around will be killed, maybe you\'ll be injured if you\'re there. That is a terror weapon. It terrorizes villages, regions, huge areas. It\'s the most massive terror campaign going on by a long shot.","There are no conservatives in the United States. The United States does not have a conservative tradition. The people who call themselves conservatives, like the Heritage Foundation or Gingrich, are believers in -- are radical statists. They believe in a powerful state, but a welfare state for the rich.","What the [James] Monroe Doctrine stated, in effect, is that the US should dominate the hemisphere.","The US cannot be brought to the World Court for major crimes, for example the supreme international crime, invasion, or violation of the UN Charter, or violation of the Genocide Convention, these are things the US is exempt from, because they exempted themselves from being subjected to international treaties in World Court proceedings.","A corporation is a state created institution, state supported institution, its concentration of private power, there is no reason why it should have the rights of persons.","Policy is largely set by economic elites and organized groups representing business interests with little concern for public attitudes or public safety, as long as the public remains passive and obedient.","The most dramatic case is that of the Central Americans. Why are people fleeing Central America? It\'s because of the atrocities the U.S. committed there. Take Boston, where there\'s a fairly large Mayan population. These people are fleeing from the highlands of Guatemala, where there was virtual genocide in the early 1980s backed by Ronald Reagan. The region was devastated, and people are still fleeing to this day, yet they\'re sent back.","Humans may be destroying their chances for decent survival. It won\'t kill everybody, but it would change the world dramatically.","Democracy, in any rational form, also imposes conditions on majority rule. That\'s what the Bill of Rights is about, for example.","There are in fact many ways to combat the Trump project of creating a tiny America, isolated from the world, cowering in fear behind walls while pursuing the Paul Ryan-style domestic policies that represent the most savage wing of the Republican establishment.","You never need an argument against the use of violence, you need an argument for it.","I suspect most likely that more Nazis came to America. I was a student at Harvard during the early 1950s. There was practically no Jewish faculty there.","How do I define God? I don\'t.... People who find such conceptions important for themselves have every right to frame them as they like. Personally, I don\'t.","That is what I have always understood to be the essence of anarchism: the conviction that the burden of proof has to be placed on authority, and that it should be dismantled if that burden cannot be met.","Take pandemics. There could easily be a severe pandemic. A lot of that comes from something we don\'t pay much attention to: Eating meat. The meat production industry, the industrial production of meat, uses an immense amount of antibiotics.We\'re now running out of antibiotics that deal with the threat of rapidly mutating bacteria. A lot of that just comes from the meat production industry. Well, do we worry about it? Well, we ought to be.","The Democrats have pretty much given up on the white working class. That would require a commitment to economic issues and that\'s not their concern.","In the case of [Antonio] Gramsci, the Fascist government agreed that he was a \\"model intellectual\\" in [Edward] Said\'s sense, and for that reason determined, in their words, that \\"we must stop this brain from functioning for twenty years.\\"","My feeling is that a human being or any complex organism has a system of cognitive structures that develop much in the way the physical organs of the body develop. That is, in their fundamental character they are innate; their basic form is determined by the genetic structure of the organism. Of course, they grow under particular environmental conditions, assuming a specific form that admits of some variation. Much of what is distinctive among human beings is a specific manner in which a variety of shared cognitive structures develop.","Hume\'s paradox does hold: power is in the hands of the governed. If they refuse to accept it, you\'re in trouble, no matter how many guns you have.","The fact that all normal children acquire essentially comparable grammars of great complexity with remarkable rapidity suggests that human beings are somehow specially designed to do this, with data-handling or \'hypothesis-formulating\' ability of unknown character and complexity.","In the literal sense, there has been no relevant evolution since the trek from Africa. But there has been substantial progress towards higher standards of rights, justice and freedom - along with all too many illustrations of how remote is the goal of a decent society.","UG [universal grammar] may be regarded as a characterization of the genetically determined language faculty. One may think of thisfaculty as a \'language acquisition device,\' an innate component of the human mind that yields a particular language through interaction with present experience, a device that converts experience into a system of knowledge attained: knowledge of one or another language.","In the late 19th century there was a major union organization, Knights of Labor, and also a radical populist movement based on farmers. It\'s hard to believe, but it was based in Texas, and it was quite radical. They wanted their own banks, their own cooperatives, their own control over sales and commerce.","The invasion of Iraq was simply a war crime. Straight-out war crime.","Haitian rice farmers are quite efficient, but they can\'t compete with U.S. agribusiness that relies on a huge government subsidy, thanks to Ronald Reagan\'s free market enthusiasms.","Who wrote the Bible? Current scholarship, to my knowledge, assumes that the material that constitutes the Old Testament was put together from various oral and folk traditions (many of them going far back) in the Hellenistic period. That was one of several currents, of which the collection that formed the New Testament was another.","So, at one extreme you have indigenous, tribal societies trying to stem the race to disaster. At the other extreme, the richest, most powerful societies in world history, like the United States and Canada, are racing full-speed ahead to destroy the environment as quickly as possible.","I would feel no hesitation in saying that it is the responsibility of a decent human being to give assistance to a child who is being attacked by a rabid dog, but I would not intend this to imply that in all imaginable circumstances one must, necessarily, act in accordance with this general responsibility.","There are two problems for our species\' survival - nuclear war and environmental catastrophe - and we\'re hurtling towards them. Knowingly.","State propaganda, when supported by the educated classes and when no deviation is permitted from it, can have a big effect. It was a lesson learned by Hitler and many others, and it has been pursued to this day.","Where are the drug cartels getting their weapons? They are being provided by the United States. Cut off that flow of arms.","Latin America was the most obedient follower of the neoliberal regime that was instituted by the United States, its allies and the international financial institutions. They followed it most rigorously. Almost everyone who\'s followed those rules, including the Western countries, have suffered. And in Latin America they suffered severely.","U.S. domestic drug policy does not carry out its stated goals, and policymakers are well aware of that. If it isn\'t about reducing substance abuse, what is it about? It is reasonably clear, both from current actions and the historical record, that substances tend to be criminalized when they are associated with the so-called dangerous classes, that the criminalization of certain substances is a technique of social control.","A lot of countries break (or go against) the international law.","Of course, we [ with Edward Herman] have a purpose: namely, to encourage readers to undertake what might be called \\"a course in intellectual self-defense,\\" and to suggest ways to proceed; in other words, to help people undermine the dedicated efforts to \\"manufacture consent\\" and to turn them into passive objects rather than agents who control their own fate.","For those of us who got into good colleges or the professions, did we stand up to that high school history teacher who told us some ridiculous lie about American history and say, \\"That\'s a ridiculous lie. You\'re an idiot\\"? No. We said, \\"All right, I\'ll keep quiet, and I\'ll write it in the exam and I\'ll think, yes, he\'s an idiot.\\" And it\'s easy to say and believe things that improve your self-image and your career and that are in other ways beneficial to yourselves.","One of the truths about the world is that there are two superpowers, one a huge power which happens to have its boot on your neck; another, a smaller power which happens to have its boot on other people\'s necks. I think that anyone in the Third World would be making a grave error if they succumbed to illusions about these matters","It is quite possible--overwhelmingly probable, one might guess--that we will always learn more about human life and personality from novels than from scientific psychology","The anniversary of Hiroshima, should be a day of somber reflection, not only on the terrible events of that day in 1945, but also on what they revealed: that humans, in their dedicated quest to extend their capacities for destruction, had finally found a way to approach the ultimate limit.","England shouldn\'t have the real freedom of vote and we shouldn\'t either. Because as [James Madison] put it, one of the primary goals of government was to protect the minority of the opulent against the majority, to make sure the opulent maintain their rights. The constitutional system was structured to ensure that outcome.","The intellectual tradition is one of servility to power, and if I didn\'t betray it I\'d be ashamed of myself.","As soon as one identifies, challenges and overcomes illegitimate power, he or she is an anarchist. Most people are anarchists. What they call themselves doesn\u2019t matter to me. The world is full of suffering, distress, violence and catastrophes. Students must decide: does something concern you or not? I say: look around, analyze the problems, ask yourself what you can do and set out on the work!","Nothing can justify crimes such as those of September 11, but we can think of the United States as an innocent victim only if we adopt the convenient path of ignoring the record of its actions and those of its allies, which are, after all, hardly a secret.","Latin America, for the first time in 500 years, is moving towards a degree of independence.","The war against working people should be understood to be a real war\u2026. Specifically in the U.S., which happens to have a highly class-conscious business class\u2026. And they have long seen themselves as fighting a bitter class war, except they don\u2019t want anybody else to know about it.","Humans have certain properties and characteristics which are intrinsic to them, just as every other organism does. That\'s human nature.","If it\'s wrong when they do it, it\'s wrong when we do it.","American society is now remarkably atomized. Political organizations have collapsed. In fact, it seems like even bowling leagues are collapsing. The left has a lot to answer for here. There\'s been a drift toward very fragmenting tendencies among left groups, toward this sort of identity politics.","I don\'t feel that there is anything deep in the political culture that prevents \\"educating the masses.\\" I\'m old enough to recall vividly the high level of culture, general and political, among first-generation working people during the Great Depression. Workers\' education was lively and effective, union-based - mostly the vigorous rising labor movement, reviving from the ashes of the 1920s. I\'ve often seen independent and impressive initiatives in working-class and poor and deprived communities today.","Nothing in these abstract economic models actually works in the real world. It doesn\'t matter how many footnotes they put in, or how many ways they tinker around the edges. The whole enterprise is totally rotten at the core: it has no relation to reality.","The very design of neoliberal principles is a direct attack on democracy.","It is important to bear in mind that political campaigns are designed by the same people who sell toothpaste and cars.","The people who were honored in the Bible were the false prophets. It was the ones we call the prophets who were jailed and driven into the desert.","States are violent institutions. The government of any country, including ours, represents some sort of domestic power structure, and it\'s usually violent. States are violent to the extent that they\'re powerful, that\'s roughly accurate.","I think we can be reasonably confident that if the American population had the slightest idea of what is being done in their name, they would be utterly appalled.","If you don\'t like what someone has to say, argue with them.","Governments are not representative.","The Ottoman Empire . . . The rulers in Turkey were fortunately so corrupt that they left people alone pretty much - were mostly interested in robbing them - and they left them alone to run their own affairs . . . with a lot of local self determination.","French intellectual life has, in my opinion, been turned into something cheap and meretricious by the \'star\' system. It is like Hollywood. Thus we go from one absurdity to another - Stalinism, existentialism. Lacan, Derrida - some of them obscene ( Stalinism), some simply infantile and ridiculous ( Lacan, Derrida). What is striking, however, is the pomposity and self-importance, at each stage.","Hamas is regularly described as \'Iranian-backed Hamas, which is dedicated to the destruction of Israel.\' One will be hard put to find something like \'democratically elected Hamas, which has long been calling for a two-state settlement in accord with the international consensus\'\u2014blocked for over 30 years by the US and Israel. All true, but not a useful contribution to the Party Line, hence dispensable.","It [the internet] should be publicly controlled but Washington is not a system of public control, it\'s mainly a system of corporate control. We ought to have a free internet, but that means having a free society, and there is fundamental questions there.","I don\'t see how one can \\"believe in organized religion.\\" What does it mean to believe in an organization? One can join it, support it, oppose it, accept its doctrines or reject them. There are many kinds of organized religion. People associate themselves with some of them, or not, for all sorts of reasons, maybe belief in some of their doctrines.","The dominant propaganda systems have appropriated the term \\"globalization\\" to refer to the specific version of international economic integration that they favor, which privileges the rights of investors and lenders, those of people being incidental. In accord with this usage, those who favor a different form of international integration, which privileges the rights of human beings, become \\"anti-globalist.\\"","In England, enclosure programs kind of destroyed the commons. In the United States, it happened later. But, ah, now it\'s happening in the world. The last remnant of the commons is the environment, which the indigenous people are still trying to preserve and we sophisticated rich people are trying to destroy.","The Pashtuns in particular are kind of trapped. They\'ve never accepted the Durand Line nor has any Afghan government historically accepted it.","When people denounced [former Iranian president Mahmoud] Ahmadinejad for rejecting and criminalizing homosexuality, it should be remembered that was true of the United States until very recently. Women\'s rights were unheard of. Civil rights proponents were horribly treated, not just in the South. It was awful there, but pretty bad here. Environmental issues did not exist. Opposition to aggression was virtually zero. In fact, so little, that to this day, even scholarship mentions the Vietnam War as beginning in 1965.","The US does not observe the free-trade principles. Those are for the weak. So agribusiness is highly subsidized and pours product into Mexico and drives out Mexican farmers. Maybe they have to go into the cities, and they don\'t have jobs to support them, so they flee across the border.","The Bush Administration do have moral values. Their moral values are very explicit: shine the boots of the rich and the powerful, kick everybody else in the face, and let your grandchildren pay for it. That simple principle predicts almost everything that\'s happening.","In many respects, the United States is the freest country in the world. I don\'t just mean in terms of limits on state coercion, though that\'s true too, but also in terms of individual relations. The United States comes closer to classlessness in terms of interpersonal relations than virtually any society.","International relations bears more than a slight resemblance to the mafia.","There\'s a tremendous gap between public opinion and public policy.","The whole infrastructure of air travel was, and is, part of government policy. It is not a natural development of a free economic system - at least not in the way that is claimed. The same is true of the roads, of course.","If you read people like say Bruce Blair one of the leading, most sober, knowledgeable specialists, he says, look, [Donald Trump] statements are all over the map, but his personality is frightening, he\'s a complete megalomaniac.","If we understood, as we do not, the physical bases for intellectual structures, I have little doubt that we would find structures in the brain for social interactions, or language, or analysis of personality - a whole variety of systems developed on the basis of a specific biological endowment.","Some kind of settlement in Kashmir is crucial for both India and Pakistan. It\'s also tearing India apart with horrible atrocities in the region which is controlled by Indian armed forces. This is feeding right back into society even in the domain of elementary civil rights.","There is a big difference between tweeting to your friend about something that is happening and having a real personal relationship with people.","The principle that human nature, in its psychological aspects, is nothing more than a product of history and given social relations removes all barriers to coercion and manipulation by the powerful.","Anarcho-syndic alism took for granted that working people ought to control their own work, its conditions, the enterprises in which they work, along with communities, so they should be associated with one another in free associations, and democracy of that kind should be the foundational elements of a more general free society.","The Fourteenth Amendment, after the civil war, in principle brought former slaves into the category of persons, theoretically. But if you actually look, almost all the cases brought up for personal rights under the Fourteenth Amendment were by corporations. Freed slaves couldn\'t do it. In fact they were pretty much driven back into something like slavery by a north - south compact, that allowed former slave states to criminalize black life, which made a criminal force that was basically used as a forced labor force, up until the 1930s.","The term \\"globalization,\\" like most terms of public discourse, has two meanings: its literal meaning, and a technical sense used for doctrinal purposes. In its literal sense, \\"globalization\\" means international integration. Its strongest proponents since its origins have been the workers movements and the left , which is why unions are called \\"internationals\\", and the strongest proponents today are those who meet annually in the World Social Forum and its many regional offshoots.","The Internet is an \xe9lite organization; most of the population of the world has never even made a phone call.","One of the questions asked in that study was, How many Vietnamese casualties would you estimate that there were during the Vietnam war? The average response on the part of Americans today is about 100,000. The official figure is about two million. The actual figure is probably three to four million. The people who conducted the study raised an appropriate question: What would we think about German political culture if, when you asked people today how many Jews died in the Holocaust, they estimated about 300,000? What would that tell us about German political culture?","There had been a free and open election in Haiti in the early 1990s and president Jean-Bertrand Aristide won, a populist priest. A few months later came the expected military coup - a very vicious military junta took over, of which the United States was passively supportive. Not openly, of course, but Haitians started to flee from the terror and were sent back and on towards Guantanamo Bay. Of course, that is against International Law. But the United States pretended that they were \\"economic refugees.\\"","Colorless green ideas sleep furiously.","In the primary debates for the 2016 election, every single Republican candidate was a climate change denier, with one exception, John Kasich - the \\"rational moderate\\" - who said it may be happening but we shouldn\'t do anything about it. For a long time, the media have downplayed the issue.","Actually, the phrase \\"national security\\" is barely used until the 1930s. And there\'s a reason. By then, the United States was beginning to become global. Before that the United States had been mostly a regional power - Britain was the biggest global power. After the Second World War, national security is everywhere, because we basically owned the world, so our security is threatened everywhere. Not just on our borders, but everywhere - so you have to have a thousand military bases around the world for \\"defense.\\"","Take like, say, Obama, he\'s called \\"liberal\\" and he\'s praised for his \\"principled objection to the Iraq war\\". What was his \\"principled objection\\"? He says it was a \\"strategic blunder,\\" like Nazi generals after Stalingrad.","In fact, it was stated early in the first Bush [presidency], Bush I, in one of their documents they pointed out in the future, US wars are going to be against much weaker enemies. And they have to be won quickly and decisively before a popular reaction develops. And Iif you take a look, that\'s what\'s done. Look at Panama, for instance, over a couple of days; and Kosovo, no American troops.","Take, for example, there is a right-wing populist uprising. It\'s very common, even on the left, to just ridicule them, but that\'s not the right reaction. If you look at those people and listen to them on talk radio, these are people with real grievances.","If the United States is accommodating, the North Koreans become accommodating. If the United States is hostile, they become hostile.","What can you do to mitigate the likelihood that Iran will develop nuclear weapons? There\'s a very simple method: move towards establishing a nuclear-weapons-free zone, which everybody in the world wants, but the US blocks.","Modern science and technology can relieve men of the necessity for specialized, imbecile labor. They may, in principle, provide the basis for a rational social order based on free association and democratic control, if we have the will to create it.","Naming our murder weapons after victims of our crimes: Apache, Tomahawk... It\'s as if the Luftwaffe were to call its fighter planes \'Jew\' and \'Gypsy.\'","As any good teacher knows, the methods of instruction and the range of material covered are matters of small importance as compared with the success in arousing the natural curiosity of the students and stimulating their interest in exploring on their own.","The idea that you have to drop any thing that you might be interested in doing because you have to pass that test tomorrow and it\'s something that you\'re not interested in, that\'s just the opposite of education. It\'s also harming teaching, because the teachers are evaluated by the results of the test.","The media is uncritical, and their so-called the concept of objectivity translates into keeping everything within the Beltway. However, Iraq was quite different. Here, there were flat-out lies, and they sort of knew it. They were desperately trying to make connections between Saddam Hussein and 9/11.","It has been known for some time that a major nuclear war might lead to nuclear winter that would destroy the attacker as well as the target. And threats are now mounting, particularly at the Russian border, confirming the prediction of George Kennan and other prominent figures that NATO expansion, particularly the way it was undertaken, would prove to be a \\"tragic mistake,\\" a \\"policy error of historic proportions.\\"","I don\'t have time, you know - I want to be able to get it [information] instantly on the internet and not have to think about it. Well, there is that phenomenon as well.","A lot of association on the internet is highly constructive. There are people interacting, interchanging ideas, making plans, coordinating activities; take any of the popular movements, a lot of the organization is through the internet. We want to have a demonstration or we want to have a meeting, its done through the internet. I think that\'s all to the good.","We have a record for Nawaz Sharif but not the others. And judging by the record, it\'s pretty hard to be optimistic. His [Sharif\'s] previous governments were very corrupt and regressive in the policies pursued.","Work can be undertaken to create an authentic independent political party, a real party, based on popular participation from the ground up, not a top-down candidate producing organization like the two official parties, working from school boards to state legislatures and beyond. Not easy in the regressive U.S. political system, but not impossible.","More generally, independent farmers had to be trained to become docile workers in the expanding industrial system. It was necessary to drive from their heads evil ideas, such as the belief that wage labor was not much different from chattel slavery. That continues to the present, now sometimes taking the form of an attack on public education.","I don\'t say you\'re self-censoring - I\'m sure you believe everything you\'re saying; but what I\'m saying is, if you believed something different, you wouldn\'t be sitting where you\'re sitting.","The United States is unique among the rich countries, developed countries, in not having some kind of a national health-care system.","Groupings of people that get together, think things through, come out to plan and so on, like unions or true political organizations, they\'ve disintegrated. And people tend to be atomized - you get down to a society based on social units based on an atom - an atomic element - which is a person and their computer. Not a society that is going to be able to function freely and democratically. The tendency is there; it doesn\'t have to be, but its something to worry about.","Independent development can be a virus that can infect others.","This would be a very good moment to institute a call for imposing the Chemical Weapons Convention on the Middle East. The actual Chemical Weapons Convention. Not the version that [Barack] Obama presented in his address to the nation and that media commentators repeat. What he said is that the convention bars the use of chemical weapons. He knows better. And so do the commentators. The Chemical Weapons Convention calls for banning the production, storage and use of chemical weapons, not just the use. So why omit production and storage?","An effective regulatory system today would be one guided by a few basic premises that can be applied flexibly but also universally.","I am not sure just what Marx had in mind when he wrote that \\"philosophers have hitherto only interpreted the world in various ways; the point is to change it.\\" Did he mean that philosophy could change the world, or that philosophers should turn to the higher priority of changing the world? If the former, then he presumably meant philosophy in a broad sense of the term, including analysis of the social order and ideas about why it should be changed, and how. In that broad sense, philosophy can play a role, indeed an essential role, in changing the world.","When I was ten years old I wanted to be a taxidermist for some reason, don\'t ask me why.","Why should workers agree to be slaves in a basically authoritarian structure? They should have control over it themselves. Why shouldn\'t communities have a dominant voice in running the institutions that affect their lives?","If you look at the minutes of the constitutional convention - which we have - Madison who was the main framer, proceeded to develop a system in which - as he put it - power would be in the hands of the wealth of the nation, the more responsible set of men and who recognize the need to protect the rights of property owners. That\'s why in the constitutional system, the most powerful part of the whole system is the senate.","The most extreme types, like Murray Rothbard, are at least honest. They\'d like to eliminate highway taxes because they force you to pay for a road you may never drive on. As an alternative, they suggest that if you and I want to get somewhere, we should build a road there and charge people tolls on it. Just try generalizing that. Such a society couldn\'t survive, and even if it could, it would be so full of terror and hate that any human being would prefer to live in hell.","The Russians were doing a lot of rotten things, you can point to them. But the idea that if you consider what Hans Morgenthau called \\"I called abuse of reality,\\" the picture of the world was almost the opposite of what they presented. But somehow this sells and is continually repeated, at least in this kind of situation.","I am a child of the Enlightenment. I think irrational belief is a dangerous phenomenon, and I try to consciously avoid irrational belief. On the other hand, I certainly recognize that it\'s a major phenomenon for people in general, and you can understand why it would be. It does, apparently, provide personal sustenance, but also bonds of association and solidarity and a means for expressing elements of one\'s personality that are often very valuable elements. To many people it does that. In my view, there\'s nothing wrong with that.","To some degree it matters who\'s in office, but it matters more how much pressure they\'re under from the public.","There are many terrorist states in the world, but the United States is unusual in that it is officially committed to international terrorism.","Advertising is tax deductible, so we all pay for the privilege of being manipulated and controlled.","Social and political issues in general seem to me fairly simple; the effort to obfuscate them in esoteric and generally vacuous theory is one of the contributions of the intelligentsia to enhancing their own power and the power of those they serve.","...free enterprise, [is] a term that refers, in practice, to a system of public subsidy and private profit, with massive government intervention in the economy to maintain a welfare state for the rich.","If you assume there is no hope, you guarantee there will be no hope.","Boards of directors are allowed to work together, so are banks and investors and corporations in alliances with one another and with powerful states. That\u2019s just fine. It\u2019s just the poor who aren\u2019t supposed to cooperate.","Workers and their families may starve to death in the New World Order of economic rationality, but diamond necklaces are cheaper in elegant New York shops, thanks to the miracle of the market.","In the pre-capitalist world, everyone had a place. It might not have been a very nice place, even maybe a horrible place, but at least they had some place in the spectrum of the society and they had some kind of a right to live in the place. Now that\'s inconsistent with capitalism, which denies the right to live. You have only the right to remain on the labour market.","A lot of the people involved in the media are very serious, honest people, and they will tell you, and I think they are right, that they are not being forced to write anything... What they don\'t tell you, and are maybe unaware of, is that they are allowed to write freely because their beliefs conform to the... standard doctrinal system, and then, yes, they are allowed to write freely and are not coerced.","Politicians don\'t want democracy here in America, why would they want it in the Middle East?","The Sanders campaign, however, broke dramatically with over a century of U.S. political history. Extensive political science research, notably the work of Thomas Ferguson, has shown convincingly that elections are pretty much bought. For example, campaign spending alone is a remarkably good predictor of electoral success, and support of corporate power and private wealth is a virtual prerequisite even for participation in the political arena.","With regard to freedom of expression there are basically two positions: you defend it vigorously for views you hate, or you reject it in favor of Stalinist/Fascist standards.","American imperialism has suffered a stunning defeat in Indochina. But the same forces are engaged In another war against a much less resilient enemy, the American people. Here, the prospects for success are much greater. The battleground is ideological, not military. At stake are the lessons to be drawn from the American war in Indochina; the outcome will determine the course and character of new imperial ventures.","U.S. international and security policy . . . has as its primary goal the preservation of what we might call \\"the Fifth Freedom,\\" understood crudely but with a fair degree of accuracy as the freedom to rob, to exploit and to dominate, to undertake any course of action to ensure that existing privilege is protected and advanced.","The United States invaded Iraq to gain control of one of the major sources of the world\'s energy.","There\'s one white powder which is by far the most lethal known, it\'s called sugar. . . . The Caribbean back in the 18th century was a soft drug producer: sugar, rum, tobacco, chocolate. And in order to do it, they had to enslave Africans.","When I look at public opinion, I\'m not far out of the mainstream. I\'m in it, in many respects. In some respects, public opinion goes beyond anything I\'ve ever said.","Civil disobedience\'s main goal typically is to try to arouse and inspire others to join and do something. Well, sometimes that is a good tactic, sometimes not.","One of the real problems of society is that its far too atomized, what sociologists call secondary associations.","We\'re now in a situation in which Capital is highly mobile and Labour is basically immobile.","France has not been able to come to terms with the fact that it\'s not a major power anymore. I mean even before the Second World War Paris was one of the main centers of intellectual and cultural life. But now Paris is a kind of subsidiary of Germany, their traditional enemy and they can\'t come to terms with it.","There\'s an interesting book about that called The Third Reich and the Ivory Tower, written by Stephen H. Norwood. It has a long discussion about Harvard, and indeed the school\'s president, James Conant, did block Jewish faculty. He was the one who prevented European Jews from being admitted to the chemistry department - his field - and also had pretty good relations with the Nazis.","In general, the attitude towards Nazi Germany was not that hostile, especially if you look at the U.S. State Department reports. In 1937 the State Department was describing Adolf Hitler as a \\"moderate\\" who was holding off the forces of the right and the left.","I do not feel that we should set up PEOPLE as \\"models\\"; rather actions, thoughts, principles.","I have never heard of anyone who was a \\"model person\\" in all aspects of his or her life, intellectual life or other aspects; nor do I see why anyone should care. We are not engaged in idol worship, after all.","Bohemian Grove seems to be a kind of frat house affair. Bilderberg [philosophy] may be marginally more serious. The CFR is transparent. You can read their publications. In the 18th century it perhaps made some sense to conjure up the Illuminati and Masons. Not since.","It\'s roughly the case that if systems become too complex to study in sufficient depth, physics hands them over to chemistry, then to biology, then experimental psychology, and finally on to history. Roughly. These are tendencies, and they tend to distinguish roughly between hard and soft sciences.","Suppose that insect wings developed primarily as thermoregulators and then were used for skimming and finally flying, evolving along the way. What would they be \\"for\\"? Or what is the skeleton \\"for\\"? For keeping one upright, protecting organs, storing calcium, making blood cells...?","You never know how [Donald Trump] is going to react. When he learned for example that he\'d lost the election by about three million votes, his instant reaction was insanity; you know, three to five million illegal immigrants somehow were organized in some incredible fashion to vote.","Bear in mind that capitalism is a tiny period of human society. You never really had capitalism, you always had one or another variant of state capitalism.","It is not a war. It is murder.","US government policies are continuing to do exactly the same thing [produce terrorism]. Two days after the Boston marathon bombings, there was a drone strike in Yemen attacking a peaceful village, which killed a target who could very easily have been apprehended. But of course it is just easier to terrorise people.","There is a noticeable general difference between the sciences and mathematics on the one hand, and the humanities and social sciences on the other. It\'s a first approximation, but one that is real. In the former, the factors of integrity tend to dominate more over the factors of ideology. It\'s not that scientists are more honest people. It\'s just that nature is a harsh taskmaster. You can lie or distort the story of the French Revolution as long as you like, and nothing will happen. Propose a false theory in chemistry, and it\'ll be refuted tomorrow.","What right does the US have to do anything in Colombia? Does Colombia have the right to bomb North Carolina? There are more Colombians dying from tobacco than Americans dying from heroin.","So Marxism, Freudianism: any one of these things I think is an irrational cult. They\'re theology, so they\'re whatever you think of theology; I don\'t think much of it. In fact, in my view that\'s exactly the right analogy: notions like Marxism and Freudianism belong to the history of organized religion.","The first commitment is raise your salary. One of the ways to raise your salary sometimes is to have short-term profits but there are many other ways.","Since November 8, 2017 the United States is literally alone in the world in first of all refusing to join in efforts to do something about climate change, but even worse, dedicated to making the situation worse. Every part of the world is trying to do something. The United States alone is trying to destroy it, and it\'s not just Trump, it\'s the whole Republican Party. You just can\'t find words for it. And it\'s not reported. It\'s not discussed.","By that time [1966], we did begin to get some protests [against Vietnam War]. But not from liberal intellectuals; they never opposed the war.","Why did the people think [Vietnam war] was fundamentally wrong and immoral? The guys who ran the polls, John E. Rielly, a professor at the University of Chicago, a liberal professor, he said what that means is that people thought too many Americans had being killed. Another possibility is they didn\'t like the fact that we were carrying out the worst crime since the Second World War. But that\'s so inconceivable that wasn\'t even offered as a possible reason.","There are a lot of people that form movements around particular commitments, like gay rights. It is important, but it does not link easily to, say, economic rights, and it often looks like it\'s opposed to them. The attempt to bring these together has yet to be done in a truly effective way, and I think it can be.","The educational system in the US was a highly predictable victim of the neoliberal reaction, guided by the maxim of \\"private affluence and public squalor.\\" Funding for public education has sharply declined. As higher education is driven to a business model in accord with neoliberal doctrine, administrative bureaucracy has sharply increased at the expense of faculty and students. Cost-cutting leads to hyper-exploitation of the more vulnerable, creating a new precariat of graduate students and adjuncts surviving on a bare pittance, replacing tenured faculty.","Student debt is structured to be a burden for life. The indebted cannot declare bankruptcy, unlike Donald Trump. Current student debt is estimated to be over $1.45 trillion. There are ample resources for that simply from waste, including the bloated military and the enormous concentrated private wealth that has accumulated in the financial and general corporate sector under neoliberal policies. There is no economic reason why free education cannot flourish from schools through colleges and university. The barriers are not economic but rather political decisions.","Well, in fact if you look at the Trump voters, you take a look at their attitudes it\'s not all that different. In some respects they\'re similar. They\'re an older version of the Sanders people. So a lot of it is racist and you have that sort of thing, but if you look at their views on say health, education, and so on, it\'s kind of the same as Sanders.","Citizenship means every four years you put a mark somewhere and you go home and let other guys run the world. It\'s a very destructive ideology.","Silicon Valley, after all, feeds off the existence of computers, the internet, the IT systems, satellites, the whole of micro electronics and so on, but a lot of that comes straight out of the state sector of the economy. Silicon Valley developed, but they expanded and turned it into commercial products and so on, but the innovation is on the basis of fundamental technological development that took places in places like this [MIT] on government funding, and that continues.","The answer to subversion of democracy is more democracy, more freedom, more justice.","Suppose Vietnam could separate itself from the American dominated global system and carry out a successful social and economic development. Then that is very dangerous because then it could be a model to other movements and groups in neighboring countries. And gradually there could be an erosion from within by indigenous forces of American domination of the region.","At the beginning of his administration, Reagan tried set the basis for American military intervention in El Salvador - which is about what Kennedy did when he came into office in regard to Vietnam. Well, when Kennedy tried it in Vietnam, it just worked like a dream. Virtually nobody opposed American bombing of South Vietnam in 1962. It was not an issue. But when Reagan began to talk of involving American forces in El Salvador there was a huge popular uproar. And he had to choose a much more indirect way of supporting the collection of gangsters in power there. He had to back off.","In the early 50s in the US, there was what was called McCarthyism and the only reason it succeeded was that there was no resistance to it. When they tried the same thing in the 60s it instantly collapsed because people simply laughed at it so they couldn\'t do it. Even a dictatorship can\'t do everything it wants. It\'s got to have some degree of popular support.","I think the foreign policy is really not Donald Trump administration concern. Like the Syria strike. I mean, it meant almost nothing. They hit an empty air base. Within a day, it was functioning again. Planes were flying off it. It was for a domestic show, you know - show what a tough guy I am; I\'m not Barack Obama.","Every single one cabinet appointment: education, environment, labor - every single one is selected to undermine any aspect of government that\'s of any help to people, and that doesn\'t benefit the super-rich. And it\'s absolutely systematic. The interesting question will be how long Donald Trump\'s constituency can fall for the con game.","The Sanders campaign showed that a candidate with mildly progressive programs could win the nomination, maybe the election, even without the backing of the major funders or any media support. There\'s good reason to suppose that Sanders would have won the nomination had it not been for shenanigans of the Obama-Clinton party managers. He is now the most popular political figure in the country by a large margin.","Take the US. Women were not even able to vote until 90 ago, at about the same time they gained the right in Afghanistan. Rights of former slaves were very limited until the 1960s, and in some ways still are. In these and other domains there has been progress in democracy, though still seriously flawed. In other dimensions - the control of concentrated wealth over the political process, for example, things have gotten much worse in recent years. And there is much more, in both directions.","Popular support for alternative energy has been very high for years. But it harms corporate profits.","The printing press had a very liberatory effect that meant individuals - small groups could produce radical pamphlets - could use it for organizing.","If workers are more insecure, that\'s very \'healthy\' for the society, because if workers are insecure, they won\'t ask for wages, they won\'t go on strike, they won\'t call for benefits; they\'ll serve the masters gladly and passively. And that\'s optimal for corporations\' economic health.","I think that what\'s actually happening is the collapse of the Center - the centrist semi-coalitions, mildly social-democrat, mildly conservative, that have been running the countries for years. They are severely declining. You can see it in voting; you can see it also in popular attitudes: contempt for what are called \\"the \xe9lites,\\" the experts, the people in charge.","The syntactic component of a grammar must specify, for each sentence, a deep structure that determines its semantic interpretationand a surface structure that determines its phonetic interpretation.","There\'s an interesting book by the former Brazilian ambassador Celso Amorim. In 2010, he initiated an effort along with Turkey to settle the whole Iran issue. Nobody outside of the United States takes it to be much of an issue. They made a deal with Iran for Iran to essentially give away its low enriched uranium to Turkey for storage, and in return, the Western powers. It was immediately scratched by Barack Obama and Hillary Clinton. And the main reason was they didn\'t want anybody else to be involved in it. We were supposed to run things, but we didn\'t say that.","There was a time traditionally - say, GM in the 1950s - it was trying to develop a consumer base that would be loyal and lasting and they were thinking in terms of an institution that would remain and grow and thrive in the society. By now, a lot of the investment firms - bankers, hedge funds - are perfectly happy to destroy what they\'re in and come out with huge, tremendous benefits. That\'s a new stage of capitalism.","Policies are designed to undermine working class organization and the reason is not only the unions fight for workers\' rights, but they also have a democratizing effect. These are institutions in which people without power can get together, support one another, learn about the world, try out their ideas, initiate programs, and that is dangerous. That\'s like a referendum in Greece. It is dangerous to allow that.","It\'s not radical Islam that worries the US -- it\'s independence","Our concern is to help people counter the efforts of those who seek to \\"regiment the public mind every bit as much as an army regiments the bodies of its soldiers,\\" so that the self-designated \\"responsible men\\" will be able to run the affairs of the world untroubled by the \\"bewildered herd\\" - the general public - who are to be marginalized and dispersed, directed to personal concerns, in a well-regulated \\"democracy.\\"","Isaiah Berlin described the intellectuals of [Mikhail] Bakunin\'s \\"Red bureaucracy\\" as a \\"secular priesthood.","I mean, the liberal democrats aren\'t going to tell the average American, \\"Yeah, you\'re being shafted because of the policies that we\'ve established over the years that we\'re maintaining now.\\" That\'s not going to be an answer. And they\'re not getting answers from the left.","In fact, various lawyers\' groups - to some extent in the U.S. but mostly in England and Canada and elsewhere - are bringing demands for a war crimes trial for the crime of aggression. However, though the invasion of Iraq was plainly an act of aggression, it doesn\'t break any records.","My position is that we should not succumb to irrational belief.","I think religion has often played a very positive role. Take western civilization, the Catholic Church has played an honorable role in helping those in need. In contrast, the US carried out a virtual war against the church in central America in the 1980\'s primarily because prime elements in the church were working with great courage and honor to help those in need. And to organize them to help themselves.","On abortion: We are talking about ambiguous issues of a complicated kind where you have to balance conflicting interests and concerns.","There was also a national policy, which as a child I didn\'t know anything about. In 1924 the first major immigration law was passed. Before that, there was an Oriental Exclusion Act, but other than that, European immigrants like my parents were generally admitted in the early years of the twentieth century. But that ended in 1924 with an immigration law that was largely directed against Jews and Italians.","I don\'t feel that I have anything to say beyond moral truisms.","There are big, extremely irrational parts of the society, and they have now been mobilized politically by the Republican establishment, hoping that these people could be an electoral base to keep them in power.","It is not that I am not a fan of American exceptionalism. That is like saying I am not a fan of the moon being made out of green cheese - it does not exist. Powerful states have quite typically considered themselves to be exceptionally magnificent, and the United States is no exception to that. The basis for it is not very substantial to put it politely.","Peace is preferable to war. But it\u2019s not an absolute value, and so we always ask, \u201cWhat kind of peace?","The missile defense component is a minor feature that nobody takes very seriously. Nobody really believes that the US is trying to protect itself from North Korea. That\'s not serious. But the militarization of space is quite serious.","Suppose that we believe what we are taught. . . . destroying the environment and militarizing outer space are rational policies . . . of institutional lunacy.","Those are possibilities for technology, which don\'t tend to be used, because of the way power is concentrated. There are all kinds of possibilities, including for coercion. In China, technology is used to control and coerce. Here too, to an extent, but not to that extent.","North Korea and China have proposed what sounds like a pretty sensible option that North Korea should end its development of nuclear weapons, the US should stop carrying out hostile military maneuvers on the North Korean border. The US immediately rejected it. Modernization program is a very clear example of how security doesn\'t matter. There is no gain in security but massive overkill of the adversary\'s deterrent capacity. The only consequence of it is to elicit the likelihood of a preemptive attack. And a preemptive attack leads to a nuclear winter world.","Of course, everybody says they\'re for peace. Hitler was for peace. Everybody is for peace. The question is: What kind of peace?","Just as I\'m opposed to political fascism, I\'m opposed to economic fascism. I think that until major institutions of society are under the popular control of participants and communities, it\'s pointless to talk about democracy.","Plainly, children learn their language. I don\'t speak Swahili. And it cannot be that my language is \'an innate property of our brain.\' Otherwise I would have been genetically programmed to speak (some variety of) English.","In fact, the capitalist class in the \'50s was sort of part of a social contract. It was part of the tenor of the times.","In our case [the United States] it happens to be basically corporate structure. Much of the population is going to be harmed by that. Those policies are designed to turn state power into an instrument that works for the wealthy. Maybe there are some crumbs for the rest of the population, maybe not. But that\'s given.","Jean Kirkpatrick [is] the chief sadist-in-residence of the Reagan Administration.","Imagine an extrahuman observer looking at us. Such an extrahuman observer would be struck precisely by the uniformity of human languages, by the very slight variation from one language to another, and by the remarkable respects in which all languages are the same. And then he would notice we do not pay any attention to that because for the purpose of human life it is quite natural and appropriate just to take for granted everything that is common. We don\'t concern ourselves with that, all we worry about are differences.","Our minds are specifically adapted to developing certain theories, and we have a science if the theories that are available to our minds happen to be close to true. Well, there is no particular reason to suppose that the intersection of true theories and theories that are accessible to the mind is very large. It may not be very large.","\'Reform\' is a word you always aughta\' watch out for. \'Reform\' is a change that you\'re supposed to like. And watch it - As soon as you hear the word \'Reform\', you should reach for your wallet and see who\'s lifting it.","When I wrote about the Spanish Civil War many years later, I used documents that I picked up when I was a child, as a lot hadn\'t been published (a lot more resources are available now).","Maybe the science is uncertain, maybe we don\'t have to worry about it. Climate change is the worst, but there\'s others.","If the most important revolutionary part of the George W. Bush Doctrine is that states that harbor terrorists are terrorist states, what do we conclude from that? We conclude exactly what Kissinger was kind enough to say: These doctrines are unilateral. They are not intended as doctrines of international law or doctrines of international affairs. They are doctrines that grant the U.S. the right to use force and violence and to harbor terrorists, but not anyone else.","Elements of the Christian fundamentalist right are one of the strongest components of \\"support for Israel\\" - support in an odd sense, because they presumably want to see it destroyed in a cosmic battle at Armageddon, after which all the proper souls will ascend to heaven - or so I understand, again, not from close reading.","Public opinion in Egypt is very antagonistic to the way the dictatorship, Mubarak dictatorship, interpreted relations with Israel. Very antagonistic.","The threat and use of violence is stimulating nuclear proliferation along with jihadi terrorism.","To go back to a moment of Western civilization remote enough in time so that we should be able to look at it dispassionately, ask what happened during World War I. What was the typical behavior of respected intellectuals in Germany, England, the United States? What happened to those who publicly questioned the nobility of the war effort, on both sides? I do not think the answers are untypical.","The evangelicals. . . . If all they want is gold Cadillacs and sex and so on, no big problem.","If something comes along that you don\'t like, there are a few sort of four-letter words that you can use to push it out of the sphere of discussion. If you were in a bar downtown, they might have different words, but if you\'re an educated person what you use are complicated words like \\"conspiracy theory\\" or \\"Marxist.\\" It\'s a way of pushing unpleasant questions off the agenda so that we can continue in our own happy ideology.","It\'s easy to put [serious threats] aside, and the media don\'t talk about them. Other things are more important. How am I going to put food on the table tomorrow? That\'s what I\'ve got to worry about, and so on. It\'s very serious, but it\'s hard to bring out the enormity of these issues, when they do not have the dramatic character of something you can show in the movies, with a nuclear weapons falling and everything disappears.","In any case, it is better to have some deal than no deal, but it\'s interesting that Obama picked the day of implementing of Iran deal to impose new sanctions on North Korea.","Poor whites didn\'t have rights. They made all kind of restrictions on voting. So person meant relatively well - off, free white man.","As the capacity to coerce declines, it is natural to turn to control of opinion as the basis for authority and domination - a fundamental principle of government already emphasized by David Hume.","A default of the US government would not only be very harmful here, it would probably send the country back into deep recession, but it just might crash the international financial system.","I think a very important aspect of language has to do with the establishment of social relations and interactions. Often, this is described as communication. But that is very misleading, I think.","Washington basically works for the corporate sector and Silicon Valley, technically at least, is suppose to sponsor initiative in creativity, whether it does or not is another question.","For a while, after the Second World War, when there was strong support for labor, this was done subtly.","Internal security means something. It means war against your own population.","The basic idea which runs right through modern history and modern liberalism is that the public has got to be marginalized. The general public are viewed as no more than ignorant and meddlesome outsiders, a bewildered herd.","I know of only one country, at least to my knowledge, which has a dissident culture where leading figures, I mean, the most famous writers, journalists, academics and so on, are not only critical of state policy, but are constantly carrying out civil disobedience and risking imprisonment and often being imprisoned, standing up for people\'s rights. That\'s Turkey.","In the Munich agreement in late 1938 [Franklin] Roosevelt sent his chief adviser Sumner Welles, who came back with a very supportive statement saying that Hitler was someone we could really do business with and so on.","Some [people] may be \\"servants of the power structure,\\" but that has to be shown. I think it often can be shown, but the burden of proof is on the critic who puts forth that thesis in particular cases.","Universities are less constrained by authority and rigid doctrine in the United States than in most other societies, to my knowledge.","So if you look at the writings of intellectuals, there are two kinds. One said, l\\"Look, if we fought harder we could have won.But the others, who were way at the left, people like Anthony Lewis of the New York Times, way out in left stream, his view in 1975 was the Vietnam war began with blundering efforts to do good. But by 1969, it was clear that it was a disaster, that was too costly to us.","People who don\'t accept that doctrinal system, they may try to survive in the media, but they are unlikely to.","If you listen to the talk shows, which are rabid right-wing, and very interesting, an important fact about the United States, they reach a huge audience. And they\'re very uniform. So right wing, I don\'t think you can even find an analog in your, but they reach a mass audience, and their view is that the corporations are liberal. Their appeal to the population is, \\"the country is run by liberals, they own the corporations, they run the government, they own the media, and they don\'t care about us ordinary people.\\"","Haiti, which has been the main target of US intervention throughout the 20th century, is the poorest. And Guatemala, which is maybe the third major target of US intervention, probably ranks third poorest.","Caterpillar was quite important because that was the first manufacturing industry that used Reaganite strike-breaking techniques. They illegally called in scabs to break a major strike. It was reported pretty well in the Chicago Tribune, who pointed out something very interesting. They said that the workers got very little support in Peoria when scabs illegally broke the strike, and that was particularly striking because that whole community had been built up by the union - it was a union-based community.","There is a kind of nonlinguistic thought going on which we are trying to represent in language, and we know that sometimes we fail.","For one thing, studying language is by itself a part of a study of human intelligence that is, perhaps, the central aspect of human nature. And second, I think, it is a good model for studying other human properties, which ought to be studied by psychologists in the same way.","We should not be speaking to, but with. That is second nature to any good teacher.","We have to recognize that there is a range of interests, like there isn\'t a single corporate interest and a single state interest, so there\'s a range. In addition to that, there is the fact of professional integrity.","The general principle is that the victors don\'t look at themselves or concede anything. The defeated typically have to, except when it\'s beneficial to the powerful for them not to.","The two countries [Pakistan and India] have already come close to nuclear confrontation twice and this could get worse. So dealing with the relationship with India is extremely important.","Those lucky enough to qualify as \\"intellectuals\\" have their own special responsibilities, deriving from their good fortune. Among these is the task that [Edward] Said describes, surely an important one.","Right at the beginning of all of this [Ukraine to join NATO], serious senior statesmen, people like [George] Kennan for example and others warned that the expansion of NATO to the east is going to cause a disaster. I mean, it\'s like having the Warsaw Pact on the Mexican border. It\'s inconceivable. And others, senior people warned about this, but policymakers didn\'t care. Just go ahead.","From 1962 to 1965 the US was dedicated to try to prevent the independence of South Vietnam, the reason was of course that Kennedy and Johnson knew that if any political solution was permitted in the south, the National Liberation Front would effectively come to power, so strong was its political support in comparison with the political support of the so-called South Vietnamese government.","Hence, a generative grammar must be a system of rules that can iterate to generate an indefinitely large number of structures. This system of rules can be analyzed into the three major components of a generative grammar: the syntactic, phonological, and semantic components... the syntactic component of a grammar must specify, for each sentence, a deep structure that determines its semantic interpretation and a surface structure that determines its phonetic interpretation. The first of these is interpreted by the semantic component; the second, by the phonological component.","The US is off the spectrum in religious commitment. It\'s been increasing since 1980 but it\'s a major part of the voting base of the Republican Party so that means committing to anti-abortion positions, opposing women\'s rights.","The first thing you ought to do is verify what I present. Just because I say it doesn\'t make it true. So check it out, see what looks correct, what looks wrong, look at other material which wasn\'t discussed, figure out what the truth really is. That\'s what you\'ve got a brain for.","I wrote an article about the marine landing [in Haiti] right away, but barely mentioned the oil, because my article would come out two months later and I assumed by then, \\"of course, everybody knows.\\" Nobody knew. There was a news report in the Wall Street Journal, in the petroleum journals, and in some small newspapers, but not in the mainstream press.","At the peak of the so-called great success of neoliberal economics, in 2007, right before the crash, non-supervisory workers were at wages considerably lower than in 1979, when the neoliberal assault was taking off. That perfectly naturally causes resentment and fear, and combines with a tendency to blame the most vulnerable.","I don\'t see much use in general slogans. Sometimes it is worth resisting evil with lesser evil, very commonly in fact.","Right now, where do we stand? Well right at the Russian border, both sides have been taking provocative actions, both sides are building up military forces. NATO forces are carrying out maneuvers hundreds of yards from the Russian border, the Russian jets are buzzing American jets. Anything could blow up in a minute.","The basic principle is that the losers have to confess, not the victors. When they do it, it\'s a crime. When we do it, it\'s not. And more generally, it\'s the defeated who are tried, not the victors.","If you want to find weapons of destruction, you can find them all over the place. Take, say, Israel. There is a very great concern right now about proliferation of nuclear weapons, as there should be. Israel has a couple of hundred nuclear weapons and also chemical and biological weapons. This stockpile is not only a threat in itself but encourages others to proliferate in reaction and in self-defense. Is anybody saying anything about this?","Most of the population in America is disenfranchised. It doesn\'t matter what they think. Just look at the passionate rhetoric about how we can\'t stand by when a country uses weapons to kill innocent civilians.","Democracy is a danger to any powerful group.","Israel has a couple of hundred nuclear weapons and also chemical and biological weapons. This stockpile is not only a threat in itself but encourages others to proliferate in reaction and in self-defense. Is anybody saying anything about this?","Iran has been calling for it for years, and the Arab countries support it. Everyone except the United States and Israel support it. The U.S. won\'t allow it because it means inspecting Israel\'s nuclear weapons. The U.S. has continued to block it, and in fact blocked it again just a couple of days ago; it just wasn\'t widely reported. Iran\'s nuclear program, as U.S. intelligence points out, is deterrent, and the bottom line is that the U.S. and Israel don\'t want Iran to have a deterrent.","And if you look at all this academic work in the conferences and so on there\'s a constant theme that terrorism is extremely hard to define and we therefore have to have a deep thinking about it. And the reason it\'s hard to define is quite simple. It\'s hard to find a definition that includes what they do to us but excludes what we do to them. That\'s quite difficult. So it takes a global war on terrorism.","No liberal newspaper ever talked about the invasion of Vietnam; they talked about the defense of Vietnam. And then they were saying, \\"well, it\'s not going well.\\" Ok, that make them liberal. It\'s like, it\'s if we were to say, that going back to, say, Nazi Germany, that Hitler\'s general staff was liberal after Stalingrad because they were criticizing his tactics: \\"It was a mistake to fight a two front war, we should\'ve knocked off Englad first,\\" or something.","The drones are a terrorist weapon, they not only kill targets but also terrorise other people.","We can imagine a society in which no one could survive as a social being because it does not correspond to biologically determined perceptions and human social needs.  For historical reasons, existing societies might have such properties, leading to various forms of pathology.","Desktop publishing was a big innovation that meant small groups or even poor societies could do their own publication without the capital investment in a major printing press. That\'s a big difference. Same is true of more advanced technologies - it can offer plenty of liberatory possibilities - can - but whether it does or not or whether it serves for coercion depends on socioeconomic decisions.","The similarity is that concentration of capital influences virtually everything that goes on. It influences the way the media functions, it very powerfully influences how the government works and it of course influences corporate sector elements, like say how Google or Amazon present materials that reach the public.","We don\'t have polls from the business world, but it\'s pretty clear that the energy corporations in America would be quite happy to be given authorization to go back into Iran instead of leaving all that to their rivals. But the state won\'t allow it. And it is setting up confrontations right now, very explicitly. Part of the reason is strategic, geo-political, economic, but part of the reason is the mafia complex. They have to be punished for disobeying us.","A lot of the people involved in the media are very serious, honest people, and they will tell you, and I think they are right, that they are not being forced to write anything.","Women didn\'t have rights. Under British common law, women were property.","In Turkey also, for a long time, the military was the decisive force but in the past 10 years they have backed off somewhat and the civilian government has gained more independence and autonomy even to shake up the military command. In fact, it even arrested several high-ranking officers [for interfering in governmental affairs]. Maybe Pakistan can move in a similar direction.","It\'s hard to achieve that, especially in a free society, but it\'s been done, and that\'s the kind of thing that activists in the IWW have to work against, right on the shop floor. It\'s not so simple, but it\'s been done before.","In the major state capitalists economies, Europe and the US, it\'s low growth and stagnation and a very sharp income differentiation a shift - a striking shift - from production to financialization.","Why not stakeholder action? There\'s no economic principal that says that management should be responsive to shareholders, in fact you can read in texts of business economics that they could just as well have a system in which the management is responsible to stakeholders.","Mexico is a pretty poor country, but they are maintaining a free, high quality public education system, not for everyone of course but pretty substantial.","The neoliberal programs of the last generation have in fact been, and were intended to be, a pretty serious attack on democracy, but also they\'ve led to stagnation or decline for large parts of the population - the working class, the lower middle class, these people have essentially been cast aside.","Whether the person should then be called \\"an intellectual\\" seems to reduce the issue to a question of terminology.","I haven\'t seen any claim that Piraha lacks recursion, that is, that there are a finite number of sentences or sentence frames. If that\'s so, it would mean that the speakers of this language aren\'t making use of a capacity that they surely have, a normal situation; plenty of people throughout history would drown if they fall into water.","What the US does is the kind of thing I described in Italy in 1948. Case after case like that, not hacking or spreading rumors in the media; but saying look, we\'re going to starve you to death or kill you or destroy you unless you vote the way we want. I mean that\'s what we do.","The [Ronald] Reagan administration picked up the rhetoric of the anti-nuclear movement; they said \\"Yyeah, you\'re right.\\" We have to eliminate nuclear weapons.","A lot of people who voted for Trump, working class people, voted for Obama in 2008. They were seduced by the slogans \\"hope\\" and \\"change.\\" They didn\'t get hope, they didn\'t get change, they were disillusioned. This time they voted for another candidate who is calling for hope and change and has promised to deliver all kinds of amazing things.","We had one or another form of state capitalism during an extremely brief period of human history, which tells us essentially nothing about human nature. If you look at human societies and human interactions, you can find anything. You find selfishness, you find altruism, you find sympathy.","I think the activism of the 1960s had a very definite civilizing effect on the whole society in all kinds of ways. So lots of things that by now are almost taken for granted were heretical in the 1960s. We had anti-sodomy laws until not many years ago.","Radical Islamist extremists surely hope that an attack on Iraq will kill many people and destroy much of the country, providing recruits for terrorist actions.","Looking at polls of Arab public opinion, you look at popular figures, the most popular figure is the prime minister of Turkey, Erdogan, and then it goes down the list. You get Osama Bin Laden, Saddam Hussein, you don\'t get Obama, or in fact any western leader. The public doesn\'t want the whole imperial project. So if you had democracy, it would be all over.","The question in brief, is whether democracy and freedom are values to be preserved or threats to be avoided . . . democracy and freedom are more than values to be treasured; they may well be essential to survival.","If you look at US internal documents, they explain very clearly what the threat of Cuba was. So, back in the early 1960s the State Department described the threat of Cuba as Castro\'s successful defiance of US policy, going back to the Monroe Doctrine. The Monroe Doctrine established the US claim to dominate the Western hemisphere and Castro was successfully defying that. That\'s not tolerable. It is like somebody saying \\"let\'s have democracy in Greece,\\" and we just can\'t tolerate that so we have to destroy the threat at its roots.","The Irish were treated horribly, even here in Boston. For example, in the late nineteenth century they were treated pretty much like African Americans. You could find signs here in Boston in the restaurants saying \\"No dogs and Irish.\\"","I had no expectations about Barack Obama and I\'m not in the least disillusioned.","So yes in theory there is a kind of a formal democracy and in many ways these were achievements and an improvement over the feudal system and more advanced than anything else in the world, but nothing that we ought to call democracy.","The escalation to attack undefended civilian targets is just a classic illustration of terrorism.","The time to be political is not when you have parties and carnivals, it\'s kind of a show, the election. It affects something but not that much. And focusing all the attention on it is I think a mistake.","I think the press, by and large, is what we call \\"liberal\\". But of course what we call \\"liberal\\" means well to the right. \\"Liberal\\" means the \\"guardians of the gates\\". So the New York Times is \\"liberal\\" by, what\'s called, the standards of political discourse, New York Times is liberal, CBS is liberal. I don\'t disagree. I think they\'re moderately critical at the fringes. They\'re not totally subordinate to power, but they are very strict in how far you can go. And in fact, their liberalism serves an extremely important function in supporting power.","The Andes region is not stable. So we can expect to see more US intervention. It could be under any kind of pretext. We can no longer use the Russians as an excuse, as we did in Central America in the 1980\'s, so drugs will have to do.","The military has a huge role in the economy [of Pakistan] with big stakes and, as you say, it has constantly intervened to make sure that it keeps its hold on policy making. Well, I hope, and there seem to be some signs, that the military is taking a backseat, not really in the economy, but in some of the policy issues. If that can continue, which perhaps it will, this will be a positive development.","Some innate capacity - some part of the human genetic endowment - enters into language acquisition. That much is uncontroversial among those who believe that humans are part of the natural world. If it were not true, would be a miracle that my granddaughter reflexively identified some elements of the blooming buzzing confusion as language-related and went on to acquire capacities of the kind that you and I are now exercising, while her pet kitten (chimp, songbird, bee...), presented with exactly the same data, could not take the first step, let alone the later ones.","For a privileged minority, Western democracy provides the leisure, the facilities, and the training to seek the truth lying hidden behind the veil of distortion and misrepresentation, ideology and class interest, through which the events of current history are presented to us.","U.S. analysts estimate that Russian military expenditures have tripled during the Bush-Putin years, in large measure a predicted reaction to the Bush administration\'s militancy and aggressiveness.","[According to the rigid dogma] we have to believe the United States would have so-called liberated Iraq even if its main products were lettuce and pickles and the main energy resource of the world were in central Africa.","The US and Europe are committing suicide in different ways. In Europe it\'s austerity in the midst of recession and that\'s guaranteed to be a disaster. There\'s some resistance to that now. In the US, it\'s essentially off-shoring production and financialization and getting rid of superfluous population through incarceration.","My feeling is that if any Republican was elected it would be almost a death knell for the species literally, just because of their attitude on climate change.","So take social media; take a look at the way they\'re used. In a lot of ways they\'re used constructively; lot of things are done that couldn\'t be done before. On the other hand a lot of the effect of social media is to set up extremely superficial contacts amongst people.","Immediately after 11 September, the U.S. closed down the Somali charitable network Al-Barakaat on grounds that it was financing terror. This achievement was hailed one of the great successes of the \'war on terror.\' In contrast, Washington\'s withdrawal of its charges as without merit a year later aroused little notice.","Like most terms of political discourse, socialism has more or less, lost its meaning. Socialism used to mean something. If you go back far enough it meant basically control of production by producers, elimination of wage labor, democratization of all spheres of life; production, commerce, education, media, workers control of factories, community control of communities, and so on. That was socialism once. But it hasn\'t meant that for a hundred years. Socialism meant something different.","What I\'ve called \\"the Mafia doctrine\\" in many publications: when the Godfather issues an edict, others must obey, or else. It\'s too dangerous to allow disobedience. A leading principle of world affairs - though, of course, officials and commentators put it more politely.","For fifty years, we heard NATO is necessary to save Western Europe from the Russian hordes, you know the slave state, stuff I was taking about. In 1990-91, no Russian hordes. Okay, what happens? Well there are actually visions of the future system that were presented. One was [Mikhail] Gorbachev. He called for a Eurasian security system, with no military blocs. He called it a Common European Home. No military blocs, no Warsaw Pact. Just an integrated security system with no conflicts.Now the other vision was presented by George Bush, this is the \\"statesman\\".","If [climate change ] became a serious proposal in the United States, there would be a huge propaganda onslaught by the business community, the energy corporations and many others, to try to frighten the population into opposing it - claiming that if they have it, all sorts of terrible things will happen, like you won\'t be able to heat your home, or whatever the story is.","For the totalitarian mind, adherence to state propaganda does not suffice: one must display proper enthusiasm while marching in the parade.","Government may not redistribute private wealth or grant special privileges to any individual or group.","Free speech has been used by the Supreme Court to give immense power to the wealthiest members of our society.","That\'s our nuclear weapons strategy [going to frighten people], as of the early post-Cold War years. And I think this is a real failure of the intellectual community, including scholarship and the media. It\'s not like you had headlines all over the place. And it\'s not secret, the documents are there. And I think that\'s probably the right picture.","The September 11  attacks were major atrocities. . . . This was a horrendous crime . . . The primary victims . . . were working people: janitors, secretaries, firemen, etc. It is likely to prove to be a crushing blow to Palestinians . . . It is also likely to lead to harsh security controls, with many possible ramifications for undermining civil liberties and internal freedom.","Scientists generally, not just evolutionary biologists, don\'t take much for granted.","When people know we are ready to use nuclear weapons, they\'re going to back off if we do something aggressive. So basically, nuclear weapons are always being used.","It is now well-known that the Taliban\'s creation was facilitated by the CIA and the ISI as part of the 1980s anti-Soviet war.","US wars are going to be against much weaker enemies. And they have to be won quickly and decisively before a popular reaction develops.","The possibility of interpersonal communication has increased substantially with contemporary technology. But as compared with the major changes, which were long ago, these are not huge.","It\'s this kind of wild unpredictability, megalomania, thin-skinned craziness that really has me worried, more than [Donald Trump] statements. Now, on the climate change there\'s just nothing to say, he\'s perfectly straightforward.","One measure for promoting both stability and fairness across financial market segments is a small sales tax on all financial transactions.","Right to a speedy jury trial and so on and so forth. But what do they mean by \'person\'? It certainly didn\'t mean individuals with flesh and blood like Native Americans who weren\'t persons, they don\'t have any rights.","There are cases - for example, the American Revolution. George Washington\'s army lost just about every battle with the British, who had a much better army. The war was basically won by guerrilla forces that managed to undermine the British occupation.","People are interested in authentic long-term, socialist goals, which is not what is usually called socialism. They should be thinking through carefully how the projected society should work, but not in extensive detail because a lot of things just have to be learned by experiment and we don\'t know enough to plan societies in detail by any means. But, general guidelines could be worked out and many of the specific problems can be discussed. That should just be part of people\'s popular consciousness. That\'s how a transition to socialism could take place.","I did not say that language as a completed system emerged in an individual in an instant. But I cannot think of a coherent alternative to the idea that mutations take place in individuals, not communities, so that whatever rewiring of the brain yielded the apparently unique properties of language, specifically recursive generation of hierarchically structured expressions, would therefore have taken place in an individual, and only later been used among individuals who had inherited this capacity.","Private sector unionization is down to practically seven percent. Meanwhile the public sector unions have kind of sustained themselves [even] under attack, but in the last few years, there\'s been a sharp [increase in the] attack on public sector unions, which Barack Obama has participated in, in fact. When you freeze salaries of federal workers, that\'s equivalent to taxing public sector people.","The Irish sea is a chasm, and it just depends who\'s been holding the whip for 800 years and who\'s been under it for 800 years.","Clinton, Kennedy, they all carried out mass murder, but they didn\'t think that that was what they were doing - nor does Bush. You know, they were defending justice and democracy from greater evils.","If you want to talk about distributing substances that are lethal, . . . let\'s be serious. Tobacco is far ahead of anything else. Alcohol is second.","It was declared by Congress that marijuana makes people insane. But . . . lawyers, defense lawyers, got the idea, OK, I can use this for an insanity defense.","Modern China; one also finds many things that are really quite admirable.","Nixon at one point informs Kissinger . . . that he wanted bombing of Cambodia. And Kissinger loyally transmits the order to the Pentagon to carry out a massive bombing campaign in Cambodia. Anything that flies on anything that moves . . . genocide.","One might ask why tobacco is legal and marijuana not. A possible answer is suggested by the nature of the crop.","The freer the society gets, the more dangerous the great beast becomes and the more you have to be careful to cage it somehow.","The more there is a need to talk about the ideals of democracy, the less democratic the system usually is.","The people who live on the land - Israelis and Palestinians - have a right to live in security and peace.","The US intervened in the Philippines to uplift and christianize the backward people, killing a couple of hundred thousand of them and destroying the place. The same thing happened in Haiti, the same thing happened with other countries.","There is no reason to accept the doctrines crafted to sustain power and privilege, or to believe that we are constrained by mysterious and unknown social laws.","Women taking care of children . . . it makes sense to pay them for that work . . . they should be paid for it, but that requires tax payments. And the same is true about protection of the environment.","The responsibility of the writer as a moral agent is to try to bring the truth about matters of human significance to an audience that can do something about them.","The only way we can put a permanent end to terrorism is to stop participating in it.","After the first International Days of Protest in October, 1965, Senator Mansfield criticized the \'sense of utter irresponsibility\' shown by the demonstrators.","The old-fashioned idea is that responsibility falls upon those who borrow and lend. Money was not borrowed by campesinos, assembly plant workers, or slum-dwellers. The mass of the population gained little from borrowing, indeed often suffered grievously from its effects.","As far as U.S. intelligence knows, Iran is developing nuclear capacities, but they don\'t know if they are trying to develop nuclear weapons or not. Chances are they\'re developing what\'s called \'nuclear capability,\' which many states have. That is the ability to have nuclear weapons if they decide to do it. That\'s not a crime.","The \'free-floating intellectual\' may occupy himself with problems because of their inherent interest and importance, perhaps to little effect.","Anyone can be a moral individual, concerned with human rights and problems; but only a college professor, a trained expert, can solve technical problems by \'sophisticated\' methods. Ergo, it is only problems of the latter sort that are important or real.","Evaluating countries is senseless and I would never put things in those terms, but that some of America\'s advances, particularly in the area of free speech, that have been achieved by centuries of popular struggle, are to be admired.","Everyone engaged in research must have had the experience of working with feverish and prolonged intensity to write a paper which no one else will read or to solve a problem which no one else thinks important and which will bring no conceivable reward - which may only confirm a general opinion that the researcher is wasting his time on irrelevancies.","I think that in order to achieve progress in the study of language and human cognitive faculties in general it is necessary first to establish \'psychic distance\' from the \'mental facts\' to which K\xf6hler referred, and then to explore the possibilities for developing explanatory theories... We must recognize that even the most familiar phenomena require explanation and that we have no privileged access to the underlying mechanisms, no more so than in physiology or physics.","There are plenty of things that are unknown, but are assumed reasonably to exist, even in the most basic sciences. Maybe 90 percent of the mass-energy in the universe is called \\"dark,\\" because nobody knows what it is.","If you want to scare people, you talk about evil.","The great soul of power extends far beyond states, to every domain of life, from families to international affairs. And throughout, every form of authority and domination bears a severe burden of proof. It is not self-legitimizing. And when it cannot bear the burden, as is commonly the case, it should be dismantled.","Extensive violations of human rights (torture, forced reduction of living standards for much of the population, police-sponsored death squads, destruction of representative institutions or of independent unions, etc.) are directly correlated with US government support. The linkage is not accidental; rather it is systematic. The reason is obvious enough. Client fascism often improves the business climate for American corporations, quite generally the guiding factor in foreign policy.","The goal is a society in which the basic social unit is you and your television set. If the kid next door is hungry, it\u2019s not your problem. If the retired couple next door invested their assets badly and are now starving, that\u2019s not your problem either.","We\'re supposed to worship Adam Smith but you\'re not supposed to read him. That\'s too dangerous.","If you want to end terrorism stop participating in it.","The atrocities in Cambodia are a direct and understandable response to the violence of the imperial system.","Barron and Paul...rely on \'specialists\' at the State and Defense Departments...Elsewhere in the media, similiar figures are bandied about, with equal credibility.","You might recall, perhaps, that we were probably the only commentators to rely on the most knowledgeable source, State Department intelligence.","What can one say about a country where a museum of science in a great city can feature an exhibit in which people fire machine guns from a helicopter at Vietnamese huts, with a light flashing when a hit is scored? What can one say about a country where such an idea can even be considered? You have to weep for this country.","Anything that you are achieving that undermines and threatens systems of power will meet with oppression. Systems of power don\'t say \'thank you.\' What\'s important is not to focus all your efforts on the oppression, but to continue the constructive work.","If we move toward the weaponisation of space, we can bid farewell to the planet. The chances of survival are very slight.","In some ways, [the student anti-sweatshop movement] is like the anti-apartheid movement, except that in this case its striking at the core of the relations of exploitation. Much of this was initiated by Charlie Kernaghan of the Institute for Global Labour and Human Rights.","The media are a corporate monopoly. They have the same point of view. The two parties are two factions of the business party. Most of the population doesn\'t even bother voting because it looks meaningless. They\'re marginalized and properly distracted. At least that\'s the goal.","It is ... necessary to whip up the population in support of foreign adventures. Usually the population is pacifist, just like they were during the First World War. The public sees no reason to get involved in foreign adventures, killing, and torture. So you have to whip them up. And to whip them up you have to frighten them.","In my own professional work I have touched on a variety of different fields. I\'ve done work in mathematical linguistics, for example, without any professional credentials in mathematics; in this subject I am completely self-taught, and not very well taught.","...a very terrifying aspect of our society, and other societies, is the equanimity and the detachment with which sane, reasonable, sensible people can observe [war and human suffering]. I think that\'s more terrifying than the occasional Hitler ...or other that crop up - these people would not able to operate were it not for this apathy and equanimity - and therefore I think that it is in some sense the sane and reasonable and tolerant people who should share a very serious burden of guilt, that they very easily throw on the shoulders of others who seem more extreme and more violent.","Kaplan can\'t understand trivialities. The triviality here is that nobody except the ultra right-wing jingoists like Kaplan are comparing atrocities by various countries. What honest people are saying seems to be incomprehensible: that we should keep to the elementary moral level of the gospels. We should pay attention to our own crimes and stop committing them. This would be true even if we were killing one person, OK? And it\'s even more true when we\'re killing millions of people.","There is still much debate about whether torture has been effective in eliciting information - the assumption being, apparently, that if it is effective, then it may be justified.","The Japanese bombing of Pearl Harbor led to many very good things. If you follow the trail, it led to kicking Europeans out of Asia - that saved tens of millions of lives in India alone.","From now on I will consider a language to be a set (finite or infinite) of sentences, each finite in length and constructed out ofa finite set of elements. All natural languages in their spoken or written form are languages in this sense.","Syntax is the study of the principles and processes by which sentences are constructed in particular languages. Syntactic investigation of a given language has as its goal the construction of a grammar that can be viewed as a device of some sort for producing the sentences of the language under analysis.","Even in a largely depoliticized society such as the United States, with no political parties or opposition press beyond the narrow spectrum of the business-dominated consensus, it is possible for populate action to have a significant impact on policy, though indirectly. That was an important lesson for the Indochina Wars.","The structure of language determines not only thought, but reality itself.","The most interesting - in fact, inspiring - people I met there [Porto Alegre] are those who remain nameless: representatives of the international campesino movement, the East Timorese delegation,... - the usual heroes, who disappear, unknown, apart from the consequences of their work.","The country that consistently ranks among the highest in educational achievement is Finland. A rich country, but education is free. Germany, education is free. France, education is free.","Latin America has much richer resources. You\'d expect it to be far more advanced than East Asia, but it had the disadvantage of being under imperialist wings.","Thanh Hoa itself is a rich agricultural province. Rice fields, a pattern of many shades of green, stretch far into the distance along the road, which also winds through foothills and the fringes of heavy jungle where tigers are said to roam. The vegetation, wild or cultivated, is lush.","Well before September 11, it was understood that with modern technology, the rich and powerful will lose their near monopoly of the means of violence and can expect to suffer atrocities on home soil.","One of the problems of organizing in the North, in the rich countries, is that people tend to think - even the activists - that instant gratification is required. You constantly hear: \'Look I went to a demonstration, and we didn\'t stop the war so what\'s the use of doing it again?\'","Governments are not representative. They have their own power, serving segments of the population that are dominant and rich.","The American escalation of the war in Laos provoked a response by the Communist forces, which now control more of Laos than ever before.","A consistent anarchist must oppose private ownership of the means of production, and the wage-slavery which is a component of this system, as incompatible with the principle that labor must be freely undertaken and under the control of the producer.","Reagan was extreme. Beginning of his administration, one of the first things was to call in scabs - hadn\'t been done for a long time, and it\'s illegal in most countries - in the air controller strike.","If the United States loses the economic weapons of control, it is very much weakened.","If you have to control people, you have to have an administrative force that does it. So in U.S. industry, even more than elsewhere, there\'s layer after layer of management - a kind of economic waste, but useful for control and domination. And the same is true in universities.","In ideal form of social control is an atomised collection of individuals focused on their own narrow concern, lacking the kinds of organisations in which they can gain information, develop and articulate their thoughts, and act constructively to achieve common ends.","Control is the source of strategic power.","One of the best predictors of policy around is Thomas Ferguson\'s investment theory of politics, as he calls it - very outstanding political economist - which essentially - I mean, to say it in a sentence, he describes elections as occasions in which groups of investors coalesce and invest to control the state.","Popular struggles to bring about a freer and more just society have been resisted by violence and repression, and massive efforts to control opinion and attitudes. Over time, however, they have met with considerable success, even though there is a long way to go, and there is often regression.","The Washington leadership has put aside non-proliferation programmes and devoted its energies and resources to driving the country to war by extraordinary deceit, then trying to manage the catastrophe it created in Iraq.","From the 1970s, there has been a significant change in the US economy, as planners, private and state, shifted it toward financialization and the offshoring of production, driven in part by the declining rate of profit in domestic manufacturing.","There are two parties, so-called, but they\'re really factions of the same party, the Business Party.","A dramatic, evocative, thoughtful and very accessible account of one of the most important stories of the century - and one of the most ominous, unless citizens are aroused to action to rein in abusive state power.","In Mexico, a poor country, higher education is of quite good quality -- and is free. Ten years ago the government tried to impose small fees. There was a national student strike and the government backed down. High tuition is not an economic necessity, as is easy to show, but a debt trap is a good technique of indoctrination and control. And resisting this makes good sense.","Farming out atrocities to paramilitaries is standard operating procedure.","Real schools ought to provide people with techniques of self-defense, but that would mean teaching the truth about the world and about the society, and schools couldn\'t survive very long if they did that.","It makes sense to work towards a better world, but it doesn\'t make any sense to have illusions about what the real world is.","I choose to live in what I think is the greatest country in the world, which is committing horrendous terrorist acts and should stop.","In the United States, the political system is a very marginal affair. There are two parties, so-called, but they\'re really factions of the same party, the Business Party.","Putting it in plain terms, the general public must be reduced to its traditional apathy and obedience, and driven from the arena of political debate and action, if democracy is to survive.","Science talks about very simple things, and asks hard questions about them. As soon as things become too complex, science can\'t deal with them... But it\'s a complicated matter: Science studies what\'s at the edge of understanding, and what\'s at the edge of understanding is usually fairly simple. And it rarely reaches human affairs. Human affairs are way too complicated.","Thomas Jefferson, the leading Enlightenment figure in the United States, along with Benjamin Franklin, who took exactly the same view, argued that dependence will lead to \\"subservience and venality\\", and will \\"suffocate the germs of virtue\\". And remember, by dependence he meant wage labor, which was considered an abomination under classical liberal principles.","The crime of liberation theology was that it takes the Gospels seriously. That\'s unacceptable. The Gospels are radical pacifist material, if you take a look at them . . . Liberation theology, in Brazil particularly, brought the actual Gospel to  peasants. They said, let\'s read what the Gospels say, and try to act on the principles they describe. That was the major crime that set off the Reagan wars of terror.","To achieve respectability, to be admitted to the debate, they must accept without question or inquiry the fundamental doctrine that the state is benevolent, governed by the loftiest intentions, adopting a defensive stance, not an actor in world affairs but only reacting to the crimes of others...If even the harshest of critics tacitly adopt these premises, then the ordinary person may ask, who am I to disagree?",". . . among all grammars meeting this condition (of adequacy), we select the simplest.","With the development of industrial capitalism, a new and unanticipated system of injustice, it is libertarian socialism that has preserved and extended the radical humanist message of the Enlightenment and the classical liberal ideals that were perverted into an ideology to sustain the emerging social order.","Libertarian socialism is properly to be regarded as the inheritor of the liberal ideals of the Enlightenment.","If you ask the CEO of some major corporation what he does, he will say, in all honesty, that he is slaving 20 hours a day to provide his customers with the best goods or services he can and creating the best possible working conditions for his employees.","Chemistry, until my childhood, not that long ago, was regarded as a calculating device. Because you couldn\'t reduce to physics. So it\'s just some way of calculating the result of experiments. The Bohr atom was treated that way.","WikiLeaks is a service to the population. Assange should get an award for - presidential medal of honor.","If a child from an Amazonian hunter-gatherer tribe comes to Boston, is raised in Boston, that child will be indistinguishable in language capacities from my children growing up here, and vice versa.","I don\'t think that experience is a very useful or convincing attribute for a sensible foreign policy. Henry Kissinger had a lot of experience.","Some of the most moving experiences I\'ve had are just in black churches in the South, during the Civil Rights Movement, where people were getting beaten, killed, really struggling for the most elementary rights.","I have trouble reading modern Hebrew. In the 1950s, I could read anything. I don\'t know how much experience you\'ve had with contemporary Hebrew. It\'s quite difficult.","The social and physical construction of suburban America really was quite complex. It was a very elaborate system, and clearly a massive social engineering project that has changed U.S. society enormously.","From the late 1940s, into and through the \'50s, there developed a complex interaction between federal government, state and local government, real-estate interests, commercial interests and court decisions, which had the effect of undermining the mass transit system across the country.","As international support for Obama\'s decision to attack Syria has collapsed, along with the credibility of government claims, the administration has fallen back on a standard pretext for war crimes when all else fails: the credibility of the threats of the self-designated policeman of the world.","Growing up in the place I did I never was aware of any other option but to question everything.","Anti-Americanism is a pure totalitarian concept. The very notion is idiotic.","When Britain and the U.S. invaded Iraq, it was with the reasonable expectation that it was going to increase the threat of terror, as it has.","I am opposed to the accumulation of executive power anywhere.","I don\'t want followers.","How people themselves perceive what they are doing is not a question that interests me.","If you are giving a graduate course you don\'t try to impress the students with oratory, you try to challenge them, get them to question you.","States are not moral agents.","As a Zionist youth leader in the 1940s, I was among those who called for a binational state in Mandatory Palestine. When a Jewish state was declared, I felt that it should have the rights of other states - no more, no less.","We can, for example, be fairly confident that either there will be a world without war or there won\'t be a world - at least, a world inhabited by creatures other than bacteria and beetles, with some scattering of others.","Language is a weapon of politicians, but language is a weapon in much of human affairs.","Sooner or later, jihadist-style terror and WMD are going to come together and the consequences could be horrendous.","Anywhere in Latin America there is a potential threat of the pathology of caudillismo and it has to be guarded against.","As a research tool, the internet is invaluable.","I don\'t see any possibility of Britain and the U.S. allowing a sovereign independent Iraq; that\'s almost inconceivable.","In America, the professor talks to the mechanic. They are in the same category.","In the academic world, most of the work that is done is clerical. A lot of the work done by professors is routine.","My proposal happens to be very mainstream.","Now financial liberalization is just a catastrophe waiting to happen, and there are very well understood reasons for that.","The government of Israel doesn\'t like the kinds of things I say, which puts them into the same category as every other government in the world.","In many respects, the United States is a great country. Freedom of speech is protected more than in any other country. It is also a very free society.","Unlimited economic growth has the marvelous quality of stilling discontent while maintaining privilege, a fact that has not gone unnoticed among liberal economists.","Governments don\'t control people like they used to.","I don\'t like the intellectual label.","Markets have built in inefficiencies, serious inefficiencies which are well known.","State formation has been a brutal project, with many hideous consequences. But the results exist, and their pernicious aspects should be overcome.","In the late 1990s, some of the worst terrorist atrocities in the world were what the Turkish government itself called state terror, namely massive atrocities, 80 percent of the arms coming from the United States, millions of refugees, tens of thousands of people killed, hideous repression, that\'s international terror, and we can go on and on.","I remember at the age of five travelling on a trolley car with my mother past a group of women on a picket line at a textile plant, seeing them being viciously beaten by security people. So that kind of thing stayed with me.","The major advances in speed of communication and ability to interact took place more than a century ago. The shift from sailing ships to telegraph was far more radical than that from telephone to email!","Concentration of executive power, unless it\'s very temporary and for specific circumstances, let\'s say fighting world war two, it\'s an assault on democracy.","For 500 years, since European explorers came, Latin American countries had been separated from one another. They had very limited relations. Integration is a prerequisite for independence.","The \'anti-globalisation movement\' is the most significant proponent of globalisation - but in the interests of people, not concentrations of state-private power.","When I was a college student and I got interested in linguistics the concern among students was, this is a lot of fun, but after we have done a structural analysis of every language in the world what\'s left? It was assumed there were basically no puzzles.","If you claim to have a theory that deduces unexpected consequences from nontrivial principles, let\'s see it.","To cite the facts of history is to fall prey to \'moral equivalence,\' or \'political correctness,\' or \'the error of of atheism,\' or one of the other misdeeds concocted to guard against the sins of understanding and insight into the real world.","I am not too happy with terms like \u201cthe left\u201d, to be honest. And I don\u2019t use it much\u2026.if by \u201cthe left\u201d you mean people who are committed to peace and justice and freedom and so on, there can\u2019t be elements of the left opposed to workers\u2019 movement, at least under that definition.","Of course all such conclusions about appropriate actions against the rich and powerful are based on a fundamental flaw: This is us, and that is them. This crucial principle, deeply embedded in Western culture, suffices to undermine even the most precise analogy and the most impeccable reasoning.","The European reaction to Obama is a European delusion.","This Sarah Palin phenomenon is very curious. I think somebody watching us from Mars \u2014 they would think the country has gone insane.","The times are too difficult and the crisis too severe to indulge in schadenfreude. Looking at it in perspective, the fact that there would be a financial crisis was perfectly predictable: its general nature, if not its magnitude. Markets are always inefficient.","As in the past, the costs and risks of the coming phases of the industrial economy were to be socialized, with eventual profits privatized.","Amusing and perfectly self-conscious charlatans.","No honest journalist should be willing to describe himself or herseif as \'embedded.\' To say, \'I\'m an embedded journalist\' is to say, \'I\'m a government Propagandist.","You don\'t get to be a respected intellectual by uttering truisms in monosyllables.","The only debatable issue, it seems to me, is whether it is more ridiculous to turn to experts in social theory for general well-confirmed propositions, or to the specialists in the great religions and philosophical systems for insights into fundamental human values.","Plainly, such an approach does not exclude other ways of trying to comprehend the world. Someone committed to it (as I am) can consistently believe (as I do) that we learn much more of human interest about how people think and feel and act by reading novels or studying history than from all of naturalistic psychology, and perhaps always will; similarly, the arts may offer appreciation of the heavens to which astrophysics cannot aspire.","People tend to rally around power.","My intellectual achievement was retarded when I went to high school. I sort of sank into a black hole because I had to go to the high-achieving, academic public high school.","Don\'t be obsessed with tactics but with purpose. Tactics have a half life.","There was no direct way to prevent the Boston murders. There are some easy ways to prevent likely future ones: by not inciting them. That\'s also true of another case of a suspect murdered, his body disposed of without autopsy, when he could easily have been apprehended and brought to trial: Osama bin Laden.","Why does everyone take for granted that we don\'t learn to grow arms, but rather, are designed to grow arms? Similarly, we should conclude that in the case of the development of moral systems; there\'s a biological endowment which in effect requires us to develop a system of moral judgment and a theory of justice, if you like, that in fact has detailed applicability over an enormous range.","The dangers of unexamined and unregulated monopoly power, particularly in the state executive, are hardly news. The right reaction is not passive acquiescence.","Remember, the U.S. is a powerful state, it\'s not like Libya. If Libya wants to carry out terrorist acts, they hire Carlos the Jackal or something. The United States hires terrorist states.","Roughly speaking, I think it\'s accurate to say that a corporate elite of managers and owners governs the economy and the political system as well, at least in very large measure.","Surely no rational or realistic person will discount the possibility that [during wartime] the United States might suddenly resort to nuclear weapons. Those who retain the instinct for survival, not to speak of minimal concern for their fellow man, will seek ways to act before rather than after the event.","Our crimes, for which we are responsible: as taxpayers, for failing to provide massive reparations, for granting refuge and immunity to the perpetrators, and for allowing the terrible facts to be sunk deep in the memory hole. All of this is of great significance, as it has been in the past.","Half the population hold that the government is run by a few big interests looking out for themselves, as polls regularly show.","We do not for example say that the person has a perfect knowledge of some language L similar to English but still different from it. What we say is that the child or foreigner has a \'partial knowledge of English\' or is \'on his or her way\' towards acquiring knowledge of English, and if they reach this goal, they will then know English.","It\'s like these people are programmed by Karl Rove. What he wants is to have liberal critics ridicule Bush because he says \'nucular\' and \'misunderestimate\' and talks with a probably fake Texas accent and so on, because then can come back with the big propaganda apparatus saying, \'See, those elite liberals who run the world and are sitting around drinking French wine and eating quiche don\'t understand us ordinary guys\'; regular guys like the guy working on the assembly line and George Bush, who is going back to his ranch to cut brush.","The first step is to penetrate the clouds of deceit and distortion and learn the truth about the world, then to organize and act to change it. That\'s never been impossible and never been easy.","September 11 shocked many Americans into an awareness that they had better pay much closer attention to what the US government does in the world and how it is perceived. Many issues have been opened for discussion that were not on the agenda before. That\'s all to the good.","Virtually all informed observers agree that a fair and equitable resolution of the plight of the Palestinians would considerably weaken the anger and hatred of Israel and the US in the Arab and Muslim worlds - and far beyond, as international polls reveal. Such an agreement is surely within reach, if the US and Israel depart from their long-standing rejectionism.","The rascal multitude are the proper targets of the mass media and a public education system geared to obedience and training in needed skills, including the skill of repeating patriotic slogans on timely occasions.","The \'corporatization of America\' during the past century has been an attack on democracy.","There\'s a very committed effort to convert the US into something resembling a Third World society, where a few people have enormous wealth and a lot of others have no security.","There is no reason to accept the doctrines crafted to sustain power and privilege, or to believe that we are constrained by mysterious and unknown social laws. These are simply decisions made within institutions that are subject to human will and that must face the test of legitimacy. And if they do not meet the test, they can be replaced by other institutions that are more free and more just, as has happened often in the past.","As for the various religions, there\'s no doubt that they are very meaningful to adherents, and allow them to delude themselves into thinking there is some meaning to their lives beyond what we agree is the case. I\'d never try to talk them out of the delusions, which are necessary for them to live a life that makes some sense to them. These beliefs can provide a framework for deeds that are noble or savage, and anywhere in between, and there\'s every reason to focus attention on the deeds and the background for them, to the extent that we can grasp it.","Prophet just means intellectual. They were people giving geopolitical analysis, moral lessons, that sort of thing. We call them intellectuals today. There were the people we honor as prophets, there were the people we condemn as false prophets. But if you look at the biblical record, at the time, it was the other way around. The flatterers of the Court of King Ahab were the ones who were honored. The ones we call prophets were driven into the desert and imprisoned.","Education is really aimed at helping students \\nget to the point \\nwhere they can learn on their own. . .","It doesn\'t matter what we cover, it matters what you discover.","Iraqi commandos landed at George W. Bush\'s compound, assassinated him, and dumped his body in the Atlantic.","The task for a modern industrial society is to achieve what is now technically realizable, namely, a society which is really based on free voluntary participation of people who produce and create, live their lives freely within institutions they control, and with limited hierarchical structures, possibly none at all","Education is imposed ignorance.","Now, the Libertarian Party, is a *capitalist* party. It\'s in favor of what *I* would regard a *particular form* of authoritarian control. Namely, the kind that comes through private ownership and control, which is an *extremely* rigid system of domination - people have to... people can survive, by renting themselves to it, and basically in no other way... I do disagree with them *very* sharply, and I think that they are not..understanding the *fundamental* doctrine, that you should be free from domination and control, including the control of the manager and the owner.","There isn\'t much point arguing about the word \\"libertarian.\\" It would make about as much sense to argue with an unreconstructed Stalinist about the word \\"democracy\\" - recall that they called what they\'d constructed \\"peoples\' democracies.\\" The weird offshoot of ultra-right individualist anarchism that is called \\"libertarian\\" here happens to amount to advocacy of perhaps the worst kind of imaginable tyranny, namely unaccountable private tyranny. If they want to call that \\"libertarian,\\" fine; after all, Stalin called his system \\"democratic.\\" But why bother arguing about it?","... an essential feature of a decent society, and an almost defining feature of a democratic society, is relative equality of outcome - not opportunity, but outcome. Without that you can\'t seriously talk about a democratic state... These concepts of the common good have a long life. They lie right at the core of classical liberalism, of Enlightenment thinking... Like Aristotle, [Adam] Smith understood that the common good will require substantial intervention to assure lasting prosperity of the poor by distribution of public revenues.","But, that\u2019s the whole point of corporatization - to try to remove the public from making decisions over their own fate, to limit the public arena, to control opinion, to make sure that the fundamental decisions that determine how the world is going to be run - which includes production, commerce, distribution, thought, social policy, foreign policy, everything - are not in the hands of the public, but rather in the hands of highly concentrated private power. In effect, tyranny unaccountable to the public.","Freedom without opportunity is a devil\'s gift.","Quite generally, international affairs have more than a slight resemblance to the Mafia. The Godfather does not take it lightly when he is crossed, even by a small storekeeper.","Judge Afiuni has suffered enough. She has been subject to acts of violence and humiliations to undermine her human dignity. I am convinced that she must be set free.","The former colonies, in Latin America in particular, have a better chance than ever before to overcome centuries of subjugation, violence and foreign intervention, which they have so far survived as dependencies with islands of luxury in a sea of misery.","The good news from the U.S. military survey of focus groups is that Iraqis do accept the Nuremberg principles. They understand that sectarian violence and the other postwar horrors are contained within the supreme international crime committed by the invaders.","Violence can succeed, as Americans know well from the conquest of the national territory. But at terrible cost. It can also provoke violence in response, and often does.","The level of destruction and terror and violence carried out by the powerful states far exceeds anything that can imaginably can be done by groups that are called terrorists and subnational groups.","If you\'re working 50 hours a week to try to maintain family income, and your children have the kinds of aspirations that come from being flooded with television from age one, and associations have declined, people end up hopeless, even though they have every option.","Our only real hope for democracy is that we get the money out of politics entirely and establish a system of publicly funded elections.","I hope that a move toward clemency with Judge Afiuni would be a step towards the importance of maintaining a properly functioning justice system.","A very large majority of the U.S. population is in favor of establishing diplomatic relations with Cuba and has been for a long time with some fluctuations. And even part of the business world is in favor of it, too. But the government won\'t allow it.","The U.S. has the most dysfunctional healthcare system in the industrial world, has about twice the per capita costs, and some of the worst outcomes. It\'s also the only privatized system.","The Occupy movement did create spontaneously communities that taught people something: you can be in a supportive community of mutual aid and cooperation and develop your own health system and library and have open space for democratic discussion and participation. Communities like that are really important.","There\'s never been anything like the so-called Vietnam Syndrome: it\'s mostly a fabrication.","Precisely constructed models for linguistic structure can play an important role, both negative and positive, in the process of discovery itself. By pushing a precise but inadequate formulation to an unacceptable conclusion, we can often expose the exact source of this inadequacy and, consequently, gain a deep understanding of the linguistic data. More positively, a formalized theory may automatically provide solutions for many problems other than those for which it was explicitly designed.","A number of analysts have observed that although bin Laden was finally killed, he won some major successes in his war against the U.S.","The argument that resistance to the war should remain strictly nonviolent seems to me overwhelming.","In the early days of the military Arpanet, my daughter was studying in Nicaragua. Because the U.S. was essentially at war with them, contact was difficult. I managed to use MIT\'s Arpanet connection, and she found one, so we could communicate thanks to the Pentagon!","Britain kept its position as the dominant world power well into the 20th century despite steady decline. By the end of World War II, dominance had shifted decisively into the hands of the upstart across the sea, the United States, by far the most powerful and wealthy society in world history.","A war with Pakistan would be an utter disaster.","When Reagan left office, he was the most unpopular living president, apart from Nixon, even below Carter. If you look at his years in office, he was not particularly popular. He was more or less average. He severely harmed the American economy.","A tremendous amount of the entrepreneurial initiative, if you want to call it that, comes from the dynamic state sector on which most of the economy relies to socialize costs and risks and privatize eventual profit. And that\'s achieved by, if you like, advertising.","Surely few if any readers have come across the sentence they are now reading, and someone who had by chance heard or seen it could not possibly remember such a fact.","In some respects, South African apartheid was more vicious than Israeli practices, and in some respects the opposite is true.","Independence of mind, enthusiasm, dedication to the field, and willingness to challenge and question and to explore new direction. There are plenty of people like that, but schools tend to discourage those characteristics.","The Republican and Democratic Parties are only factions of the Government Party.","It\'s not a free trade agreement. It has virtually nothing to do with free trade... It\'s a protectionist agreement; it\'s anti free-trade.","From a comparative perspective, the United States is unusual if not unique in the lack of restraints on freedom of expression. It is also unusual in the range and effectiveness of methods employed to restrain freedom of thought... Where the voice of the people is heard, elite groups must insure their voice says the right things.","Democracy was regarded as entering into a crisis in the 1960s. The crisis was that large segments of the population were becoming organized and active and trying to participate in the political arena.","The people of the Third World need our sympathetic understanding and, much more than that, they need our help. We can provide them with a margin of survival by internal disruption in the United States. Whether they can succeed against the kind of brutality we impose on them depends in large part on what happens here.","Suppose that humans happen to be so constructed that they desire the opportunity for freely undertaken productive work. Suppose that they want to be free from the meddling of technocrats and commissars, bankers and tycoons, mad bombers who engage in psychological tests of will with peasants defending their homes, behavioral scientists who can\'t tell a pigeon from a poet, or anyone else who tries to wish freedom and dignity out of existence or beat them into oblivion.","These are questions for action, not speculation, which is idle.","One substitute for the disappearing Evil Empire (The Soviet Union) has been the threat of drug traffickers from Latin America. In early September 1989, a major government-media blitz was launched by the President. That month the AP wires carried more stories about drugs than about Latin America, Asia, the Middle East and Africa combined. If you looked at television, every news program had a big section on how drugs were destroying our society, becoming the greatest threat to our existence, etc.","Our yearning for democracy is accompanied by a no less profound yearning for peace. And the media also faced the task of historical engineering to establish this required truth. We therefore have phenomena called \'peace missions\' and the \'peace process\'. These are terms that apply to whatever the United States happens to be doing or advocating at some moment... in short, \'War is Peace\'.","Borders are semiporous. Capital flows more freely than people across them. on C Span.","It\'s as if we\'re higher apes who had a language faculty inserted.","The basic principle, rarely violated, is that what conflicts with the requirements of power and privilege does not exist.","We are entering a period of human history that may provide an answer to the question of whether it is better to be smart than stupid.","Somebodys paying the corporations that destroyed Iraq and the corporations that are rebuilding it. Theyre getting paid by the American taxpayer in both cases. So we pay them to destroy the country, and then we pay them to rebuild it. Those are gifts from U.S. taxpayer to U.S. corporations.","Debt is a trap, especially student debt, which is enormous, far larger than credit card debt. It\u2019s a trap for the rest of your life because the laws are designed so that you can\u2019t get out of it. If a business, say, gets in too much debt it can declare bankruptcy, but individuals can almost never be relieved of student debt through bankruptcy.","As long as each individual is facing the television tube alone, formal freedom poses no threat to privilege","A principle familiar to propagandists is that the doctrine to be instilled in the target audience should not be articulated: that would only expose them to reflection, inquiry, and, very likely, ridicule. The proper procedure is to drill them home by constantly presupposing them, so that they become the very condition for discourse.","Jamie Kilstein and Allison Kilkenny have created an important political radio show that balances humor and unreported news. At a time when media conglomerates dominate the airwaves, independent media like Citizen Radio is vital to national discourse.","... the media serve the interests of state and corporate power, which are closely interlinked, framing their reporting and analysis in a manner supportive of established privilege and limiting debate and discussion accordingly.","You know, we have little bits of understanding, glimpses, a little bit of light here and there, but there\'s a tremendous amount of darkness, which is a challenge. I think life would be pretty boring if we understood everything. It\'s better if we don\'t understand anything and know that we don\'t, that\'s the important part.","ISIS is a monstrosity. It didn\'t come from nowhere. It\'s one of the results of the U.S. hitting a very vulnerable society - Iraq - with a sledgehammer.","Pick the topic you like: the Middle East, international terrorism, Central America, whatever it is - the picture of the world that\'s presented to the public has only the remotest relation to reality. The truth of the matter is buried under edifice after edifice of lies upon lies. It\'s all been a marvelous success from the point of view in deterring the threat of democracy, achieved under conditions of freedom, which is extremely interesting. It\'s not like a totalitarian state, where it\'s done by force. These achievements are under conditions of freedom.","I see no anti-Semitic implications in denial of the existence of gas chambers, or even denial of the Holocaust.","The childcare tax credit makes some sense.","Greece has been, in many ways, a partially dysfunctional society. For example, the wealthy barely pay taxes... to an extent, that\'s true elsewhere, including the United States, but it\'s been pretty extreme in Greece.","My own feeling is that one should refuse to participate in any activity that implements American aggression - thus tax refusal, draft refusal, avoidance of work that can be used by the agencies of militarism and repression, all seem to me essential.","I didn\'t pay my taxes for years.","Why should Iran have a deterrent strategy? Well, it\'s surrounded by hostile enemies. Both of its borders have been under occupation by a hostile superpower, the United States, which is constantly violating the U.N. charter by leaving open what they call the saying, \'all options are open\' - meaning the threat of war.","Occupying armies have responsibilities, not rights. Their primary responsibility is to withdraw as quickly and expeditiously as possible, in a manner determined by the occupied population.","Responsibility, I believe, accrues through privilege.","By most accounts, Aristide is the most popular figure in Haiti.","Descriptive grammar is an attempt to give an account of what the current system is for either a society or an individual, whatever you happen to be studying.","The West Bank is essentially imprisoned.","the Federal Reserve, has an official commitment to two different policies. One is to prevent inflation from getting too high. The second is to maintain high employment... The European central bank has only the first. It has no commitment to keep employment up.","What happened in the missile crisis in October 1962 has been prettified to make it look as if acts of courage and thoughtfulness abounded. The truth is that the whole episode was almost insane.","Cuba has become a symbol of courageous resistance to attack. Since 1959, Cuba has been under attack from the hemispheric superpower.","I know some really outstanding Turkish journalists, and have been pleased and honored to be able to join with them a few times in their courageous protests against state terror and repression.","As a tactic, violence is absurd. No one can compete with the Government in violence, and the resort to violence, which will surely fail, will simply frighten and alienate some who can be reached, and will further encourage the ideologists and administrators of forceful repression.","The people who were really important are the ones whose names are forgotten. And that\'s true of every movement that ever existed.","To summarize, draft resistance can make use of the inegalitarian nature of American society as a technique for increasing the cost of American aggression, and it threatens values that are important to those in a decision-making position.","Right after 9-11, as far as I know, one newspaper in the United States had the integrity to investigate opinion in the Muslim world: the \'Wall Street Journal.\'","Those who had demanded no more than an end to the bombing of North Vietnam and a commitment to negotiations saw their demands being realized, and lapsed into silence.","Mr. Mijanovi and those associated with him are the hope and the conscience of the Yugoslav revolution.","If you\'re in favour of any policy - reform, revolution, stability, regression, whatever - if you\'re at least minimally moral, it\'s because you think it\'s somehow good for people. And good for people means conforming to their fundamental nature.","Karl Marx was in favor of socialist and communist-socialist revolutions, but he had a pretty nuanced view about it.","It is a privilege to join the campaign to support Bradley Manning for his courage and integrity in serving his country by helping make the government accountable to its citizens, and to inform the world of what its people should know.","I admire Ralph Nader and Denis Kucinich very much, and insofar as they bring up issues and carry out an educational and organisational function - that\'s important, and fine, and I support it.","In Kosovo, the U.S. has chosen a course of action that escalates atrocities and violence. It is also a course of action that strikes a blow against the regime of international order, but which offers the weak at least some protection from predatory states.","My speculation is that the U.S. does not want to establish the principle that it has to defer to some higher authority before carrying out the use of violence.","Colombia has been the leading western recipient of U.S. arms and training as violence has grown through the \'90s.","In 1962, war was avoided by Khrushchev\'s willingness to accept Kennedy\'s hegemonic demands.","In general, I think, U.S. policies remain constant, going back to the Second World War. But the capacity to implement them is declining.","It\'s designed to carry forward the neoliberal project to maximize profit and domination, and to set the working people in the world in competition with one another so as to lower wages to increase insecurity","Reparations - not just aid - should be provided by those responsible for devastating Iraqi civilian society by cruel sanctions and military actions, and - together with other criminal states - for supporting Saddam Hussein through his worst atrocities and beyond. That is the minimum that honesty requires.","The American claim that the bombing of North Vietnam was directed against military targets does not withstand direct investigation.","Washington still refuses to provide evidence to support the claims in 1990 that a huge Iraqi military build-up on the Saudi border justified war.","Presented with the claims of nineteenth-century racist anthropology, a rational person will ask two sorts of questions: \'What is the scientific status of the claims?\' \'What social or ideological needs do they serve?\'","The Iranian government is undoubtedly a severe danger to its own population, but not beyond that.","There is no body of theory or significant body of relevant information, beyond the comprehension of the layman, which makes policy immune from criticism.","Every time there has been an effort by the Haitian people to overcome the misery and poverty that comes from 200 years of bitter attacks, really bitter, the U.S. steps in and blocks it.","When I arrived in Laos and found young Americans living there, out of free choice, I was surprised. After only a week, I began to have a sense of the appeal of the country and its people - along with despair about its future.","Palestinians have no wealth or power.","Markets are lethal, if only because of ignoring externalities, the impacts of their transactions on the environment.","The United States is a violent military state. It\'s been involved in military action all over the place.","One of the most interesting reactions to come out of 1968 was in the first publication of the Trilateral Commission, which believed there was a \'crisis of democracy\' from too much participation of the masses.","The neo-cons constitute a radical reactionary fringe of the planning spectrum, but the spectrum is narrow.","There\'s very little dislike of Americans in the world, shown by repeated polls, and the dissatisfaction - that is, the hatred and the anger - they come from acceptance of American values, not a rejection of them, and recognition that they\'re rejected by the U.S. government and by U.S. elites, which does lead to hatred and anger.","It is true that classical libertarian thought is opposed to state intervention in social life, as a consequence of deeper assumptions about the human need for liberty, diversity, and free association.","If you\'re teaching today what you were teaching five years ago, either the field is dead or you are.","These are fashionable people who call themselves philosophers.","The kind of work that should be the main part of life is the kind of work you would want to do if you weren\'t being paid for it. It\u2019s work that comes out of your own internal needs, interests and concerns.","The social system is taking on a form in which finding out what you want to do is less and less of an option because your life is too structured, organised, controlled and disciplined.","It\u2019s not going to be easy to proceed. There are going to be barriers, difficulties, hardships, failures - it\u2019s inevitable. But unless the spirit of the last year, here and elsewhere in the country and around the globe, unless that continues to grow and becomes a major force in the social and political world, the chances for a decent future are not very high.","...if you ask me whether or not I\'m an atheist, I wouldn\'t even answer. I would first want an explanation of what it is that I\'m supposed not to believe in, and I\'ve never seen an explanation.","The real world of American society is one which it is very misleading to call simply a democracy. Of course, it is in a sense a democracy, but it is one in which there are enormous inequities in the distribution of power and force. For example, the entire commercial and industrial system is in principle excluded from the democratic process, including everything that goes on within it","What the public wants is called \'politically unrealistic.\' Translated into English, that means power and privilege are opposed to it.","Democracy doesn\'t mean much if people have to confront concentrated systems of economic power as isolated individuals. Democracy means something if people can organize to gain information, to have thoughts for that matter, to make plans, to enter into the political system in some active way, to put forth programs and so on. If organizations of that kind exist, then democracy can exist too. Otherwise it\'s a matter of pushing a lever every couple of years; it\'s like having the choice between Coca-Cola and Pepsi-Cola.","In November 2004, U.S. occupation forces launched their second major attack on the city of Falluja. The press reported major war crimes instantly, with approval.","It\'s a near miracle that nuclear war has so far been avoided.","On October 15, 1965, an estimated 70,000 people took part in large-scale anti-war demonstrations.","Whatever the reasons may be, I was very much affected by events of the 1930s - the Spanish Civil War, for example, though I was barely literate.","There\'s a War Crimes Act in the United States passed by a Republican Congress in 1996, which says that grave breaches of the Geneva Convention are subject to the death penalty. And that doesn\'t mean the soldier that committed them - that means the commanders.","John Lewis Gaddis is not only the favorite historian of the Reagan administration, but he\'s regarded as the dean of Cold War scholarship, the leading figure in the American Cold War scholarship, a professor at Yale.","Since the civil war in Laos was resumed in earnest in 1963, American participation has been veiled in secrecy.","Up until the First World War, when people turned anti-German, Germany had been described by American political scientists as the model of democracy.","The prescription for endless war poses a far greater danger to Americans than perceived enemies do, for reasons the terrorist organisations understand very well.","Pre-emptive war might fall within the framework of international law.","The target of preventive war must have several characteristics. It must be virtually defenceless; it must be important enough to be worth the trouble; it must be possible to portray it as the ultimate evil and an imminent threat to our survival.","The Iraq War was the first conflict in western history in which an imperialist war was massively protested against before it had even been launched.","In the 1960s, there was a point, 1968, \'69, when there was a very strong antiwar movement against the war in Vietnam. But it\'s worth remembering that the war in Vietnam started - an outright war started in 1962.","In 1961, the United States began chemical warfare in Vietnam, South Vietnam, chemical warfare to destroy crops and livestock. That went on for seven years. The level of poison - they used the most extreme carcinogen known: dioxin. And this went on for years.","The money in politics is a cash cow for the media.","In societies that profess some respect for law, suspects are apprehended and brought to fair trial. I stress \'suspects.\'","Armed attack has a definition in international law. It means sudden, overwhelming, instantaneous ongoing attack.","It was during the Reagan years that defiance of international law and the U.N. Charter became entirely open.","Some international law specialists compare the invasion of Iraq to the \'crimes against the peace\' for which Nazi leaders were indicted at Nuremberg.","In the case of Yugoslavia v. NATO, one of the charges was genocide. The U.S. appealed to the court, saying that, by law, the United States is immune to the charge of genocide, self-immunized, and the court accepted that, so the case proceeded against the other NATO powers but not against the United States.","The U.S. - the idea that the U.S. has introduced and imposed principles of international law, that\'s hardly even a joke. The United States has even gone so far as to veto Security Council resolutions calling on all states to observe international law. That was in the 1980s under Reagan.","I do think that Magna Carta and international law are worth paying some attention to.","The crimes against Palestinians in the Occupied Territories and elsewhere, particularly Lebanon, are so shocking that the only emotionally valid reaction is rage and a call for extreme actions. But that does not help the victims. And, in fact, it\'s likely to harm them.","I felt that we could hardly improve on the conception of the university expressed by one of the founders of the modern system, Wilhelm von Humboldt, also one of the founders of classical liberalism. That seems to me true today as well, though ideals of course have to be adapted to changing circumstances.","Individuals in a university - students, faculty, staff - can choose to become politically engaged, and a free university should foster a climate in which those are natural choices.","Insofar as the universities are free and independent, they will also be \\"subversive,\\" in the sense that dominant structures of power and their ideological support will be subjected to challenge and critique, a counterpart to attitudes that are fostered in the hard sciences wherever they are taken seriously.","It is one thing for the institution to offer space for serious engagement, in thought and action, and to encourage free and independent use of such opportunities; it is something else for the university to become engaged as an institution, beyond a fairly narrow range where true consensus exists, and even that raises questions.","The two tendencies are antithetical in significant respects. These are distinctions that should be kept in mind, however one feels that the problems and dilemmas that constantly arise should be resolved.","It\'s true that many say that [they] object to the idea of \\"human nature,\\" but it\'s not clear what that is supposed to mean. Are we different from ants?","All forms of involuntary servitude are prohibited, not only slavery but also conscription, forced association, and forced welfare distribution.","Iceland is capitalist social democratic, rather like the Nordic countries generally. The capital had a mayor who is an anarchist, but the city has been nothing like that. In fact a few years ago it was super-neoliberal, which led to the crash.","There\'s actually an article in the Washington Post, I don\'t know whether it\'s tongue in cheek or not, which said the criterion for being on the list of banned states is that [Donald] Trump doesn\'t have business interests there.","This is real. This is the real mad man theory. We have to be irrational and vindictive, so people don\'t know what we\'re up to. This is not [Donald] Trump and [Steve] Bannon, it\'s from the [Bill] Clinton era.","[With] military threats, you can see them actually, you can imagine it. People don\'t think about it enough. But if you think about it for a minute, you can see that a nuclear attack could be the end of everything.","Take something you really don\'t think about: Plastics in the ocean. I mean plastics in the ocean have an enormous ecological effect.","The Second World War had really devastating effects for much of Europe. It really didn\'t take them very long to reconstruct state capitalist democracies because it was in people\'s heads. There were other parts of the world that were pretty much devastated and they couldn\'t do it; they didn\'t have the conceptions in their mind. A lot of it is human consciousness.","Occupy was not a movement, it was a tactic. You can\'t sit forever in a park near Wall Street. You can\'t do it for more than a few months. It was a tactic I had not predicted. If people asked me, I would have said \\"don\'t do it.\\" But it was a great success, an enormous success, with a big impact on people\'s thinking, on people\'s actions.","We should recall that during the Second World War and the Great Depression there was an upsurge in popular, radical democracy. In all over the world. It took different forms, but it was there, everywhere. In Greece it was in the Greek revolution, and so on. And it had to be crushed. In countries like Greece, it was crushed by violence. In countries like Italy, where the US forces entered in 1943, it was crushed by attacking and destroying the anti-German partisans and restoring the traditional order.","To understand how people organize social systems, we have to discover the principles that we create to make some societies intelligible.","Every time a candidate came up from the base, that is with popular support, the Republican establishment went into high gear to destroy them with massive propaganda attack ads and so on. It was one after another, each one crazier than the last.","I\'m sorry to say it has some historical analogs. It\'s kind of reminiscent of what happened in Germany in the late Weimar years.","The Republican establishment, the mainstream corporate financial wealth, is getting to a point where it can\'t control the base it\'s mobilized.","I\'ve occasionally been asked to talk on Israel-Palestine. Sometimes it works, and sometimes it elicits hysteria in the community.","In the United States, and to a certain extent in Canada, there\'s very little interest in what happens outside their borders.","The United States is a very insular society. Most people know very little about the outside world and don\'t care that much. They\'re concerned with their own affairs.","People don\'t have knowledge and understanding about the outside world, or about history [in the USA].","When something isn\'t constantly drummed-up by the media, [people] just don\'t know about it.","Syria is bad enough, it\'s a pretty terrible atrocity. But there are much worse ones in the world. So for example, the worst atrocities in the past decade have been in the Congo, the Eastern Congo, where maybe 5 million people have been killed.","Intellectuals of the categories happen to enjoy unusual privilege, unique in history, I suppose. It\'s easy enough to find ugly illustrations of repression, malice, dishonesty, marginalization and exclusion in the academic world.","How many educated Americans can even remember the names of the assassinated Jesuit intellectuals of El Salvador, or would know where to find a word they wrote? The answers are revealing, particularly when we draw the striking - and historically typical - contrast to the attitudes towards their counterparts in enemy domains.","Given their unusual privilege, Western intellectuals can realistically accomplish a great deal. The limits are imposed by will more than objective circumstances. And about human will predictions are without value.","The main mineral in your cellphone, coltan [a black metallic ore], comes from the Eastern Congo. Multinational corporations are there exploiting the very rich mineral resources of the region. A lot of them are backing militias which are fighting one other to gain control of the resources or a piece of the resources.","It seems self-evident that we should want people to be free, to be able to play an active part in making decisions about matters of concern to them, to the largest possible extent.","We should therefore be opposed to institutional barriers to that freedom: Military dictatorships, for example. Or states run by a Central Committee.","Pakistan just cannot survive if it continues to do so (continue this confrontation with India).","Pakistan will never be able to match the Indian militarily and the effort to do so is taking an immense toll on the society. It\'s also extremely dangerous with all the weapons development. The two countries have already come close to nuclear confrontation twice and this could get worse. So dealing with the relationship with India is extremely important.","The U.S. directed the war against South Vietnam. There was a political settlement in 1954. But in the late \'50\'s the United States organized an internal repression in South Vietnam, not using its troops, but using the local apparatus it was constructing. This was a very significant and very effective campaign of violence and terrorism against the Vietminh - which was the communist-led nationalist force that fought the French. And the Vietminh at that time was adhering to the Geneva Accords, hoping that the political settlement would work out in South Vietnam.","There\'s just no question that the United States was trying desperately to prevent the independence of South Vietnam and to prevent a political settlement inside South Vietnam. And in fact it went to war precisely to prevent that. It finally bombed the North in 1965 with the purpose of trying to get the North to use its influence to call off the insurgency in the South.","Why was the United States so afraid of an independent South Vietnam? Well, I think the reason again is pretty clear from the internal government documents. Precisely what they were afraid of was that the \\"takeover\\" of South Vietnam by nationalist forces would not be brutal. They feared it would be conciliatory and that there would be successful social and economic development - and that the whole region might work.","Younger people who are being indoctrinated into the contemporary system of falsification - they really have to do some research to find out what is the truth. In the general population, people forget or don\'t care that much. And gradually what you hear drilled into your head everyday comes to be believed. People don\'t understand what you\'re talking about any more if you discuss the American war on South Vietnam.","A colonial war is a very dirty kind of war. You\'re not fighting armed forces. You\'re fighting mostly unarmed people. And to fight that kind of war requires professional killers, which means mercenaries.","The 50,000 Korean mercenaries we had in Vietnam were professional killers and just massacred people outright. And the American army did plenty of that too, but it couldn\'t take it after awhile. It\'s not the kind of job you can give to conscripts who are not trained to be murderers.","Isn\'t it interesting that eating a banana is somehow comical.","I\'m into eating as little as possible, paying as little attention as possible. I never cook. Never use the stove or anything.","There\'s kind of a hidden point which isn\'t being brought out, and that is that it is inconceivable that the U.S. would permit democracy in the Middle East, and for a very simple reason. Just take a look at polls of Arab public opinion. They exist. You can\'t find them in the press, but they exist from prestigious polling agencies. Released by major institutions. And what they show is that if there was democracy in the Middle East, the entire U.S. program for domination of the Middle East would be down the tube.","Arab public opinion does not regard Iran as a hostile entity. In fact it\'s so supportive of Iran that a majority would think the place would be better off if Iran had nuclear weapons. The main enemies are the United States and Isreal, in the 80, 90 percent range.","Plainly elites in America don\'t want democracy. And why should they? Democracy is always harmful to elite interests. Almost by definition.","I don\'t like piracy but if anybody\'s concerned about piracy, why don\'t they pay attention to our role in it?","For thirty years, Isreal has been highjacking ships in international waters, killing people, taking hostages, bringing them to Israel, putting them in secret prisons, all with the help of the United States. That\'s serious piracy.","The big change, the really radical change in communication, was in the late 19th century. The shift from sailing ships to telegraph is astronomical. Everything since then has been small increments, including the internet. So you don\'t have to wait for a letter to get to England in six weeks, you have almost instant communication. That was an enormous shift.","The change between horse and buggy to automobile is a big change and there hasn\'t been a major change since.","In America, we happen to be living in a third world country from the point of view of economic and social development. I came back from New York yesterday and I took the fastest train in the country, the Acela. My wife and I took the New York-Boston train sixty years ago - it wasn\'t called the Acela then - and I think it\'s improved by about fifteen minutes since then. Any other country in the world would be about half the time. In fact when it\'s riding along the Connecticut turnpike it\'s barely keeping up with traffic, which is just scandalous.","There\'s a tremendous amount of language loss. Most of the attention is given to indigenous languages, which makes sense, but some of the most dramatic language loss is in Europe.","English is a second language in most of the educated sectors of Europe and much of the world. But maybe in the future Chinese will be. But I doubt that national languages will disappear. In fact, to some extent they\'re becoming more diverse, like in Europe.","One contribution scientists can and should make is to be clear and explicit about the limits of scientific understanding, a matter that is particularly important in societies where people are trained to defer to alleged experts.","I have written occasionally on links between my scientific work and political thinking, but not much, because the links seem to me abstract and speculative.","Ronald Reagan in the US was not a particularly popular president, but after his death sectors of wealth and power created a huge propaganda campaign that converted this disgraceful figure into a semi-divinity.","With regard to nuclear weapons, it\'s kind of hard to say. [Donald Trump] is said lots of things. The national security experts are terrified. But they\'re more terrified by his personality than by his statements.","Any little issue - Miss Universe, or whatever it may be - [Donald Trump] is completely unpredictable, he\'ll go off into outer space.","[Donald Trump] guru Steve Bannon is worse, he\'s much scarier. He probably knows what he\'s doing.","Some of [Donald Trump] comments can be interpreted as potentially reducing the threat of nuclear war. The major threat right now is right on the Russian border. Notice, not the Mexican border, the Russian border. And it\'s serious. He has made various statements moving towards reducing the tensions, accommodating Russian concerns and so on.","Michael Flynn, national security adviser, [his reaction] to the Iranian missile test the other day was very frightening. Now the missile test is ill-advised, they shouldn\'t have done it. But it\'s not in violation of international law or international agreements. They shouldn\'t have done it. His reaction suggested maybe we\'re going to go to war in retaliation.","This crazy ban on the seven states, where we can\'t accept immigrants, almost every analyst points out the obvious: It just increases the threat of terror. It lays the basis for terror. It\'s just like the atrocities in Abu Ghraib and Bagram and Guantanamo. They\'re the most fabulous recruiting techniques for Al Qaeda and ISIS.","[Mikhail] Gorbachev said that he would agree to the unification of Germany, and even adherence of Germany to NATO, which was quite a concession, if NATO didn\'t move to East Germany. And [George] Bush and [James] Baker promised verbally, that\'s critical, verbally that NATO would not expand \\"one inch to the east,\\" which meant East Germany. Nobody was talking about anything farther at the time. They would not expand one inch to the east. Now that was a verbal promise. It was never written. NATO immediately expanded to East Germany.","Okay, NATO expanded to East Berlin and East Germany. Under [Bill] Clinton NATO expanded further, to the former Russian satellites. In 2008 NATO formally made an offer to Ukraine to join NATO. That\'s unbelievable. I mean, Ukraine is the geopolitical heartland of Russian concern, quite aside from historical connections, population and so on.","Any incident could instantly blow up. Both sides [USA and Russia] are modernizing and increasing their military systems, including nuclear systems.","There\'s something deeply rooted in American culture. You can pretty much identify what it was. You take a look at the history. It was internal conquest. You had to defend yourself against what the Declaration of Independence, Thomas Jefferson, an enlightened figure, called the attacks of the \\"merciless Indian savages,\\" whose known way of warfare was torture and destruction. Also you had a slave population, you had to protect yourself against them. You needed guns.","In southern culture, possession of a gun became kind of a sign of manhood, not just because of slaves but other white men. If you had a gun, you\'re not going to push me around. You know, I\'m not one of those guys you can kick in the face.","I grew up in that, when I was a kid. My friends and I used to play cowboys and Indians. We were cowboys killing the Indians, following the Wild West stories. All of this combined into a very strange culture, which is frightened.","I think half the population supports this ban on these dangerous immigrants who are going to come in and do something, who knows what. And meanwhile the countries that really have been involved in terrorism, they\'re out. It\'s kind of like I think it was Oklahoma banning Sharia law.","In fact, it\'s pretty dramatic when you get to 1975, very revealing, the [Vietnam] war ends. Everybody had to write something about the war, what it meant. You also had polls of public opinion, and they\'re dramatically different.","We could not bring democracy to South Vietnam at a cost that we were willing to accept. So it was a disaster. That\' is the left extreme.","Take a look at public opinion. About 70 percent of the population, in the polls, said the [Vietnam ] war was fundamentally wrong and immoral, not a mistake. And that attitude lasted as long as polls were taken in the early \'80s.","What happened in the following years? Well, I think that among the educated classes it stayed the same. You talk about humanitarian intervention, it\'s like Vietnam was a humanitarian intervention. Among the public, it\'s quite different.","Take the Iraq War,it\'s the second worst crime after the Second World War. It\'s the first time in history, in the history of imperialism, there were huge demonstrations, before the war was officially launched.","[After Vietnam] the type of interventions that are carried out are designed so as not to elicit public reactions.","You know, people talk about [Richard] Nixon\'s \\"madman theory.\\" We don\'t really know much about that. It was in memoirs, by somebody else.","The idea that people should be allowed to decide something about their own fate is just anathema to European elites.","Nobody can successfully defy the master of the hemisphere [America], in fact of the world, hence the savagery.","There are many concepts of spirituality, among them, various notions of divinity developed in the Judaeo-Christian-Islamic religions. Within these the concepts vary greatly.","In Europe there\'s kind of a reaction to the European Union, kind of a move towards some kind of regionalization. It\'s more advanced in some regions than others, like in Spain for example. Catelan was repressed under Franco. People spoke it, but not publicly. It\'s now the language of Catelonia. The Basque language is being revived, not just the language but the culture, the folk music and everything else. So you\'re getting more diverse societies, and it\'s happening in Britain as well.","Welsh is now almost a national language in Wales. The Scottish dialects are reviving to some extent. I don\'t think it\'s a major thing, but it\'s there, and it\'s happening elsewhere.","The local grocery store was a gathering, a community place. You knew the owner, if you didn\'t have any money they\'d let you go for a couple days. You talked. It was a friendly place. Supermarkets are totally impersonal. I mean, you may say hello to the checkout girl or something, but the personal connections are all gone.","I\'m pretty much out of popular culture altogether.","I just don\'t care about popular culture. It looks to me pointless and superficial. If I had free time I\'d rather read a 19th century novel.","I\'m no expert on pornography. The core element of it, I think, is degradation of women, whatever else goes on. I don\'t think it should be outlawed, but I\'m not in favor of the degradation of anybody.","My linguistics is pretty theoretical.","If you want information about sports, I can tell you things from the 1940\'s, and the couple years that my grandson was kind of a jock, but nothing in between.","If you believe in democracy, why shouldn\'t you know what the government is doing?","I\'ve spent a lot of time working on declassified documents - and they do get declassified after decades - you look at the record of declassified documents, and they are mostly concerned with keeping what the government does secret from its own population. It\'s mostly defense of the power system from its own population. Very little is authentic security.","There are by now declassified documents from the 1950s that tells you a lot about what\'s going on in Egypt and we should have known it then. It\'s about exactly what\'s happening, how we can disregard public opinion as long as the dictators we support are capable of suppressing their populations. So to hell with public opinion. That\'s all right there in the 1950\'s. That\'s not security. That\'s not security of the government. That\'s, if anything, security from its own population. And there\'s a lot of that.","There are leaks from the Embassy in Honduras. There was a coup in 2009. Obama broke with most of Latin America and even Europe and supported the military coup, still does. The ambassador in Honduras sent back a detailed analysis saying the coup was military, illegal, unconstitutional, and that the legitimate president was thrown out. Okay, we now know that Washington was perfectly aware of that and decided to support the military coup anyway. We should have known that at the time. The government has no right to keep that information secret.","The Iranian issue I don\'t think has much to do with nuclear weapons frankly. Nobody is saying Iran should have nuclear weapons \xadnor should anybody else. But the point in the Middle East, as distinct from North Korea, is that this is center of the world\'s energy resources. Originally the British and secondarily the French had dominated it, but after the Second World War, it\'s been a U.S. preserve. That\'s been an axiom of U.S. foreign policy, that it must control Middle East energy resources.","Iran is independent and independence is not tolerated.","Take Cuba. A very large majority of the U.S. population is in favor of establishing diplomatic relations with Cuba and has been for a long time with some fluctuations. And even part of the business world is in favor of it too. But the government won\'t allow it.","International affairs is very much run like the mafia. The godfather does not accept disobedience, even from a small storekeeper who doesn\'t pay his protection money. You have to have obedience otherwise the idea can spread that you don\'t have to listen to the orders and it can spread to important places.","The United States is going to continue to punish Iran because of its defiance.","Venezuela is independent. It\'s diversifying its exports to a limited extent, instead of just being dependent on exports to the United States. And it\'s initiating moves toward Latin American integration and independence. It\'s what they call a Bolivarian alternative and the United States doesn\'t like any of that.","Latin America is all moving to the left, from Venezuela to Argentina with rare exceptions, but there\'s a good left and a bad left.","For decades Israel has been capturing, and kidnapping Lebanese and Palestinian refugees on the high seas, from Cyprus to Lebanon, killing them in Lebanon, bringing them to Israel, holding them as hostages. It\'s been going on for decades, has anybody called for an invasion of Israel?","You can\'t mention Hezbollah in the U.S. media without putting in the context of \\"Iranian-supported Hezbollah.\\" That\'s its name. Its name is Iranian-supported Hezbollah. It gets Iranian support. But you can mention Israel without saying US-supported Israel. So this is more tacit propaganda.","The idea that Hezbollah is acting as an agent of Iran is very dubious. It\'s not accepted by specialists on Iran or specialists on Hezbollah. But it\'s the party line. Or sometimes you can put in Syria, i.e. \\"Syrian-supported Hezbollah,\\" but since Syria is of less interest now you have to emphasize Iranian support.","Allowing an independent and sovereign Iraq could be a nightmare for the United States. It would mean that it would be Shi\'ite-dominated, at least if it\'s minimally democratic. It would continue to improve relations with Iran, just what the United States doesn\'t want to see. And beyond that, right across the border in Saudi Arabia where most of Saudi oil is, there happens to be a large Shi\'ite population, probably a majority.","Moves toward sovereignty in Iraq stimulate pressures first for human rights among the bitterly repressed Shi\'ite population but also toward some degree of autonomy. You can imagine a kind of a loose Shi\'ite alliance in Iraq, Saudi Arabia, and Iran, controlling most of the world\'s oil and independent of the United States. And much worse, although Europe can be intimidated by the United States, China can\'t. It\'s one of the reasons, the main reasons, why China is considered a threat. We\'re back to the Mafia principle.","China has been there for 3,000 years, has contempt for the barbarians, is overcoming a century of domination, and simply moves on its own. It does not get intimidated when Uncle Sam shakes his fist. That\'s scary.","It\'s a principle that anything our leaders do is for noble reasons. It may be mistaken, it may be ugly, but basically noble. And if you bring in normal moderate, conservative, strategic, economic objectives you threatening that principle.","Hamas must agree to first recognize Israel, second to end all violence, third to accept past agreements. Try to find a mention of the fact that the United States and Israel reject all three of those. They obviously don\'t recognize Palestine, they certainly don\'t withdraw the use of violence or the threat of it - in fact they insist on it - and they don\'t accept past agreements, including the road map.","Hamas is a political party and political parties don\'t recognize other countries.","I still think, despite everything, that the US is very unlikely to attack Iran. It could be a huge catastrophe; nobody knows what the consequences would be. I imagine that only an administration that\'s really desperate would resort to that.","I remember talking to, 40 years ago, one of the leading people in the government who was involved in arms control, pressing for arms control measures, d\xe9tente, and so on. He\'s very high up, and we were talking about whether arms control could succeed. And only partially as a joke he said, \\"Well it might succeed if the high tech industry makes more profit from arms control than it can make from weapons-related research and production. If we get to that tipping point maybe arms control will work.\\" He was partially joking but there\'s a truth that lies behind it.","The manufacturing industry is starting to press for some kind of national healthcare. Now it\'s beginning to put it on the agenda. It doesn\'t matter if the population wants it. What 90% of the population wants would be kind of irrelevant. But if part of the concentration of corporate capital that basically runs the country - another thing we\'re not allowed to say but it\'s obvious - if part of that sector becomes in favor then the issue moves onto the political agenda.","The developing world voice can be amplified enormously by support from the wealthy and the privileged, otherwise it\'s very likely to be marginalized.","Modifying the core institutions of the society is no small challenge.","Human needs are served by a sustainable lifestyle, almost by definition, if humans include coming generations. And a shift to such technologies as high-speed rail instead of maximizing fossil fuel use, and solar energy, is not \\"relentless resource extraction.\\"","A functioning eco-system is a human need.","Not being optimistic falls a long way short of predicting that all is finished.","What has to be done today is (1) large-scale conversion (weatherizing , etc.), (2) sharp change in transportation to greater efficiency, like high-speed rail, (3) serious efforts to move to sustainable energy, probably solar in the somewhat longer term, (4) other adjustments that are feasible. If done effectively, that might be enough to stave off disaster. If not, then we can give up the ghost, because there are no alternatives in this world, at least none that I\'ve seen suggested.","I do not see how we can rationally oppose high speed rail because of the environmental and other costs without considering the social and human consequences of the radical elimination of transportation that this entails.","The Iraq War is the first war in history, in which there were huge demonstrations before the war was launched, not beginning five years later and then being broken up. All of these are changes, and the people who are writing in journals today lived through these changes.","It\'s kind of interesting and sick that the intellectual culture called the 1960s, \\"time of troubles,\\" a dangerous period in which a lot of harm was done to the society. And the reason is because we were civilized and that\'s dangerous. That increased the commitment to democracy, to rights and so on, and this left people much less obedient.","If you owned everything and a tiny little piece gets out of control, then your world\'s gone. Like some unusual child who has a million toys and one of them is stolen, he\'s going to perish.","The Republican Party among the public is a minority party.","[The Republican Party] for example, they do run the House of Representatives, they\'re a majority there, and it\'s the House that is essentially sending the government into shutdown and maybe default. But they won the majority of seats there because of various kinds of chicanery. They got a minority of the votes, but a majority of the seats, and they\'re using them to press forward an agenda which is extremely harmful to the public.","The US health-care system is a complete scandal. It\'s got twice the costs of comparable countries and some of the worst outcomes.","[Health-care system] is largely privatized and unregulated. So of course it\'s highly inefficient and costly.","What\'s called Obamacare is an effort to mildly change this [health-care system], not change it as far as it should go or as much as the population wants it to go, but to make it a little better and a little more affordable.","The Republicans have picked that as the one thing that they want to hang on to to try to gain some political stand, so they have to destroy what they call Obamacare. This is now not all the Republicans, it\'s a wing of the Republican Party, which is called conservative but in fact is just deeply reactionary.","[ Republican Party] is correctly described as a \\"radical insurgency\\" by one of the leading conservative commentators, Norman Ornstein.","There\'s a radical insurgency, which is a large part of the Republican base, which is willing to do anything, destroy the country, whatever, in order to get rid of this Affordable Care Act. That\'s the one thing that they\'re able to hang onto.","The shutdown itself is bad but not devastating. The real danger will come up in a couple of weeks. There\'s legislation which is in fact routine - it\'s passed every year - which allows the government to borrow money, otherwise it can\'t function. If Congress does not approve this budget request, the government may have to default.","Maybe [the Republicans] \'ll find ways around it, but the financial system of the world depends very heavily on the credibility of the US Treasury Department. US Treasury securities are what\'s called \\"good as gold\\"; they\'re the basis of international finance, and if the government can\'t uphold them, if they become valueless, the effect on the international financial system could be quite severe. But in order to destroy a limited health-care law, the right-wing Republicans, the reactionary Republicans, are willing to do that.","There\'s a split in the US about how this [split] will be resolved. The main point to look at is the split within the Republican Party. The Republican establishment, and Wall Street, and the bankers, and the corporate executives and so on, they don\'t want this. They don\'t want it at all. It\'s the part of the base that is mobilized that wants it.","[There is] is all part of the whole neoliberal shift in the economy. But the parties have shifted to the right.","Today\'s Democrats are pretty much what used to be called moderate Republicans a generation ago.","The Republicans went so far to the right that they just can\'t get votes. They\'ve become a dedicated party of the very rich and the corporate sector.","You can\'t get votes that way. So [the Republicans] have been compelled to mobilize a base of voters and gone to elements of the country that have always been there but were kind of marginal to the political system, for example, religious extremists.","The United States is off the international spectrum in religious extremism.","Half of the [USA] population, roughly, thinks the world was created a couple thousand years ago. Two thirds of the country is expecting the second coming of Christ. They\'ve also had to turn to nativists. The gun culture in the United States, which is out of control, is party fueled by people who think \'we\'ve got to have our guns to protect ourselves.\'","The Republican Primaries were quite interesting. The establishment had its candidate, [Mitt] Romney, a kind of a Wall Street lawyer and investor, and they wanted him in. But the base didn\'t want him.","The government of Rwanda, which is a US client, is intervening massively, and Uganda to an extent. It\'s almost an international war in Africa. Well, how many people know about this?","It is the worst atrocity underway [in Rwanda]. But it\'s barely in the media, and people just don\'t know about it. And that\'s quite generally true.","What happened in Syria was, President [Barack] Obama had made a statement announcing what he called his \\"red line\\": You can\'t use chemical weapons, you can do anything else but [use] chemical weapons.","Credible reports came through that Syria had used chemical weapons. Whether it\'s true actually is still open to question, but it\'s very probably true. At that point, what was at stake was what is called credibility. So if you read the political actors, political leadership, foreign policy commentary, they constantly point out accurately that US credibility was at stake, and we have to maintain US credibility. So therefore something had to be done to show you can\'t violate our orders.","A bombing was planned [in Syria], which would probably make the situation worse, but would at least establish US credibility.","What is \\"credibility\\"? It\'s a very familiar notion. It\'s basically the notion that is central to the Mafia. So suppose say the Godfather produces some kind of edict and says you\'re going to have to pay protection money.","The United States is the Godfather when it establishes edicts. Others had better live up to them, or else. We have to demonstrate that. So that\'s what the bombing of Syria was to have demonstrated.","There was very little international support, even England wouldn\'t support [bombing of Syria], which is amazing.","[Barack] Obama was reaching a point [with Syria bombing] where he might not have been able to carry it off.He was losing support internally, and was compelled to send the vote to Congress, and it looked as if he was going to be defeated, which would have been a very serious blow to his presidency, to his authority.","Israel produces and stores chemical weapons. So therefore the US will prevent the Chemical Weapons Convention from being imposed on the Middle East. But it\'s necessary to evade this by misrepresenting the convention, and I think maybe 100 percent of the media, or close to it, go along. But that\'s a critical issue. Actually, Syria\'s chemical weapons were developed largely as a deterrent to Israeli nuclear weapons. Also, not mentioned.","For the past century or so that\'s [ Monroe Doctrine] actually been true, but it\'s declining very significantly.","South America has virtually broken away in the last decade. That\'s an event of historic significance. South America just doesn\'t follow US orders. In fact there isn\'t a single US military base left there.","South America goes its own way dramatically in international affairs.","There was a hemispheric conference in Colombia. It couldn\'t reach a consensus, so there was no declaration that came out, [but] on the crucial issues, Canada and the US were totally isolated. The rest of the hemisphere voted one way, and the US and Canada rejected it. So there couldn\'t be a consensus.","The US and Canada are now increasingly isolated in the hemisphere, and sooner or later, I think we\'re going to find that the US and Canada are simply excluded from hemispheric affairs. That\'s a sharp reversal of what was the case not long ago.","Part of the uprising of Latin America, particularly in the last 10 to 15 years, has been a reaction to [neoliberal regime], and they have thrown out a lot of these measures and moved in a different direction. In earlier years, the US would have overthrown the governments or, one way or another, curtailed them. Now, it can\'t do that.","Very urgent measures need to be taken, and without much delay, in dealing with the ongoing destruction of the environment.","I should say that Canada is one of the major criminals, not just the tar sands and so on, but even mining throughout the world, a lot of it is Canadian. It\'s extremely destructive, so an important thing for Canadians to do is curtail the predatory and destructive behavior of their own government and corporations. A carbon tax is one way of doing it.","Bolivia is in the lead internationally in talking about the threat of environmental catastrophe. It\'s generally true where there are indigenous populations, there are important things happening; where the indigenous populations have been marginalized or exterminated, things go to a disaster. This is true worldwide, and Bolivia is striking because it\'s a majority population and in the lead.","Europe is being subjected to the kinds of programs that devastated Latin America for many years. Latin America has thrown them out and is pulling out: It\'s successful; it\'s democratizing; it\'s economically developing; and it\'s free from the shrapnel of US imperialism for 25 years. Meanwhile, Western Europe is destroying itself systematically, destroying itself going in the opposite direction.","The rich and powerful countries are trying to wreck as much as possible. You know, go off the cliff as soon as you can. Extract every drop of hydrocarbons off the ground and destroy the environment. At the opposite extreme are countries like Bolivia and Ecuador, indigenous people around the world, and first nations in Canada and tribal people in India, campesinos in Colombia... They\'re trying to save the commons.","Capitalism is based on the principle that everything has to be privately owned; it can\'t be held in common. There is even a dogma, which is today called, the \\"tragedy of the commons\\" which holds that if things are held in common they are going to be destroyed. If they\'re privatized, like you give them to Bechtel or Monsanto or ExxonMobil, then they\'ll be preserved because that\'s the capitalist\'s religion.","Power has to be protected from scrutiny. That\'s the principle of every dictatorship, of every autocracy. You hear it from high priests at Harvard and every government department, that power has to be kept secret otherwise it will fade and it won\'t work. But Bradley Manning is violating that principle.","Most of intellectuals are false prophets, flatterers of the court. The real prophets are the exception and treated badly. How badly they\'re treated depends on the society. Like in Eastern Europe, they were treated very badly. In Latin America, they were slaughtered.","Honduras has become a murder capital of the world; there\'s horrible atrocities, infanticide, murder of women is way up, and people are fleeing in desperation. They come to the border, and we put them in trucks and send them back to Mexico to die. And here people are scared of illegal immigrants - that\'s what we\'re doing. It\'s pretty shocking.","What matters is the way we Americans think about ourselves. We think about ourselves as incapable of committing crimes. Everything we do, we make a lot of errors, you know, you can\'t help it. Mistakes all over the place, but out of na\xefvet\xe9 or, you know, misplaced kindness or something like that.","The educational system is pretty much geared to passing the next exam. You\'re educated to pass tests and not to understand.","It\'s been a real success - one of the great business successes in the United States - to break down organization, to separate people too: it\'s part of consumerism. If you can drive people toward individual consumption, that\'s the highest goal in life. And furthermore, drive them into debt so they\'re trapped. You don\'t have to worry about a democracy function because people are trapped and they\'re alone.","A democracy barely functions under the neoliberal system.","A large part of the left is pro-Assad. In those circles, you can\'t criticize Assad, but you know he\'s a monstrous war criminal. And anyone who criticizes Assad is joining the US imperialists. That\'s just ludicrous.","If in fact, the US story is correct, if it is true that Syria used chemical weapons, then it wouldn\'t be a major crime to send a kind of shot across the bow saying you can\'t do this anymore. Not the best thing in the world, but not a major crime, either. So, I think at the very least there should have been an inquiry into what happened. But just joining the bandwagon about how we\'re finally standing up to crimes in Syria, that\'s ridiculous.","The Russian ambassador at the United Nations did make some proposals for a political settlement in which Bashar Assad would be slowly eased out. The West dismissed it immediately, and we don\'t know if it was real, because it didn\'t come from the Kremlin, and it was informal. But the point is every such proposal is immediately scotched. And you just don\'t know if they\'re real.","There was an international conference going on in Morocco that was a follow up for the Paris conference - to put some teeth in the Paris agreements. But on November 8, 2017 the conferences stopped. The question was, Will we survive? Not a word about it. Even more amazing, the world is looking to China to save them. The US is the wrecking machine that is destroying everything. The world is hoping that China will somehow come to the rescue.","There are people on the left who say, Look, we can\'t let these atrocities go on, so let\'s enter the war and get rid of Bashar Assad. The problem with that is you get into a nuclear war with Russia. And Syria gets wiped out along with everything else. So, it\'s fine to say, OK, let\'s stop the crimes, but how exactly?","President Barack Obama, to his credit, has given - issued personal pardons in deserving cases. But he should go far beyond. He should proceed to what is in fact an urgent necessity: to grant a general pardon to 11 million people who are living and working here, productive citizens in all but name, threatened with deportation by the incoming Donald Trump administration. This would be a horrible humanitarian tragedy, a moral outrage.","I think that sooner or later the white working-class constituency will recognize, and in fact, much of the rural population will come to recognize, that the Trump\'s promises are built on sand. There is nothing there.","If Palestinian Authority refuse to join the US-run negotiations, their basis for support would collapse. They survive on donations essentially. Israel has made sure that it\'s not a productive economy.","Syria is descending into suicide. It\'s a horror story and getting worse and worse. There\'s no bright spot on the horizon. What will probably happen, if this continues, is that Syria will be partitioned into probably three regions; a Kurdish region - which is already forming - that could pull out and join in some fashion the semi-autonomous Iraqi Kurdistan, maybe with some kind of deal with Turkey.","Millions of people are getting the vote, and we have to educate them to keep them from our throats. In other words, we have to train them in obedience and servility, so they\'re not going to think through the way the world works and come after our throats.","Right now, we happen to be in a general period of regression, not just in education. A lot of what\'s happening is sort of backlash to the 60s; the 60s were a democratizing period.","Education is not just you learn how a mosquito flies in the rain, but you learn how to be creative and why it\'s exciting to learn things and create things and make up new things.","Obama\'s latest line is that he didn\'t establish a \\"red line\\" but the world did through its conventions on chemical warfare.","The racism is so profound and the recognition - the kind of deep recognition that you have to humiliate. It\'s not about to killing or torture. It\'s to humiliate. So the oppressed feel degraded. And both the oppressed understand and the oppressors understand. It\'s constant.","The United States is a special case, and for me, very interesting. It\'s studied carefully and we know a lot about it. One of the most striking features of the elections is the class-based character of the vote. Now, class is not discussed or even measured in the United States. In fact, the word is almost obscene, except for the term \\"middle class.\\" And you can\'t get exact class data; the census doesn\'t even give class data. But you can sort of see the significance of it just from income figures.","There\'s a very striking fact about the elections which you can\'t miss if you looked at the red-and-blue electoral map the next day: it\'s the same political landscape that you saw during the Civil War - nothing much has changed except the party names.","We have never had class-based parties. We\'ve had parties run by the business classes. There\'s slight variations. Like in the New Deal period, there was a lot of popular activism, so things shifted slightly, but not much.","If you have worker-owned and worker-managed enterprises, you\'ve got a different sociopolitical system.","Take a look at the current debates in Washington, and of course, everything in the media. Only one issue is discussed: the deficit - the least significant issue, but the most significant issue for the banks. The big problem, joblessness, is barely discussed, even though that\'s what the public wants, as polls clearly show. That\'s even what the business press supports, but the financial institutions are so powerful that the only issue is the deficit, and this runs right through the intellectual culture.","There are simple things which would make sense. Take, say, weatherization, which would make a big cut in the unemployment rate. That\'s the kind of work that plenty of people are quick to do, and it would save individual households money, and it would make a significant reduction in the threats of climate change. But something is holding it back: the sociopathic character of market systems.","We have to be a little cautious about not trying to kill a gnat with an atom bomb. The performances are so utterly absurd regarding the \\"post-truth\\" moment that the proper response might best be ridicule.","Stephen Colbert\'s recent comment is apropos: When the Republican legislature of North Carolina responded to a scientific study predicting a threatening rise in sea level by barring state and local agencies from developing regulations or planning documents to address the problem, Colbert responded: \\"This is a brilliant solution. If your science gives you a result that you don\'t like, pass a law saying the result is illegal. Problem solved.\\"","The most important issues to address are the truly existential threats we face: climate change and nuclear war. On the former, the Republican leadership, in splendid isolation from the world, is almost unanimously dedicated to destroying the chances for decent survival; strong words, but no exaggeration. There is a great deal that can be done at the local and state level to counter their malign project.","On nuclear war, actions in Syria and at the Russian border raise very serious threats of confrontation that might trigger war, an unthinkable prospect. Furthermore, Trump\'s pursuit of Obama\'s programs of modernization of the nuclear forces poses extraordinary dangers. As we have recently learned, the modernized U.S. nuclear force is seriously fraying the slender thread on which survival is suspended.","In a moment of crisis, of which there are all too many, Russian military planners may conclude that lacking a deterrent, the only hope of survival is a first strike - which means the end for all of us.","One can contrive a religious motivation for virtually any choice of action, from commitment to the highest ideals to support for the most horrendous atrocities. In the sacred texts, we can find uplifting calls for peace, justice and mercy, along with the most genocidal passages in the literary canon. Conscience is our guide, whatever trappings we might choose to clothe it in.","Iraq has the second largest oil reserves in the world, it is right in the midst of the major energy reserves in the world. Its been a primary goal of US policy since World War II to control what the State Department called \\"a stupendous source of strategic power\\" and one of the greatest material prizes in history.","Establishing a client state in Iraq would significantly enhance that strategic power, a matter of great significance for the future. As Zbigniew Brzezinski observed, it would provide the US with \\"critical leverage\\" of its European and Asian rivals, a conception with roots in early post-war planning. These are substantial reasons for aggression - not unlike those of the British when they invaded and occupied Iraq over 80 years earlier, at the dawn of the oil age.","A person who issues that charge that someone adheres to the principle \\"do as I say, not as I do\\" has three options: produce an example; withdraw the charge; take the coward\'s way out and slink away silently.","It\'s not a matter of public relations and rhetorical style but of actions. It\'s the actions and policies under George W.Bush administration that have left the US government remarkably isolated, feared and often hated to an extent with no historical precedent.","One should be cautious about \\"general conceptions.\\" I think a strong case can be made that activism today is as high as ever, perhaps more so, and is also taking new and significant forms. There has never been anything like the international solidarity movements that began to take shape in the 1980s, right in the mainstream, or the global justice movements that have become a very powerful force in later years. It\'s true that the society is highly atomized, which does induce a sense of hopelessness often - quite mistakenly I think.","There are enormous opportunities to work for a world that is more free, peaceful and just.","My feeling is that the Supreme Court reached a reasonable standard of protection of speech in the 1960s, a standard higher than any other country in the world, to my knowledge. In brief, speech should be protected up to participation in imminent criminal action.","If you and I go into a store to rob it, and I say \\"shoot,\\" that\'s not protected. Like all judicial decisions and legislation, this leaves plenty of gray areas, including many of great significance that are rarely discussed: advocacy of imminent war crimes, such as aggression, for example. I think we would all agree that such speech should be protected, despite the often horrific consequences, but it\'s worth noting that that stretches the doctrine to its limits.","Latin America is now exploring new and often promising paths in rejecting the doctrinal notions of \\"globalization,\\" and also in the remarkable growth of popular movements and authentic participation in the political systems. How successful this will be is more a matter for action than for speculation.","In other countries, rich and poor, education remains substantially free, with educational standards that rank high in global comparisons. Even in the US, higher education was almost free during the economically successful years before the neoliberal reaction - and it was a much poorer country then. The GI bill provided free education to huge numbers of people - white men overwhelmingly - who would probably never have gone to college, a great benefit to them personally and to the whole society. Tuition at private colleges was far below today\'s exorbitant costs.","Students typically are at a period of their lives when they\'re more free than at any other time. They\'re out of parental control. They\'re not yet burdened by the needs of trying to put food on the table in a pretty repressive environment, often, and they\'re free to explore, to create, to invent, to act, and to organize. Over and over through the years, student activism has been extremely significant in initiating and galvanizing major changes. I don\'t see any reason for that to change.","The human species is now at a point where it has to make choices that are going to determine whether decent survival is even possible. Environmental catastrophe, including war, maybe pandemics, these are very serious issues and they can\'t be addressed within the current structure of institutions. That\'s almost given. There have to be real significant changes, and only really effective popular mass-based movements can introduce and carry forward such initiatives, as indeed did happen during the 1930s.","There was great anxiety about Russian intervention in the recent German elections, perhaps contributing to the frightening surge of support for the right-wing nationalist, if not neo-fascist, \\"Alternative for Germany\\".","Through much of its history, the US did not have high inequality as compared with Europe. Less so, in fact. That began to change in the industrial age, reaching a peak in 1928, after the forceful destruction of the labor movement and crushing of independent thought. Largely as a result of labor mobilization, inequality declined during the Great Depression, a tendency continuing through the great growth period of regulated capitalism in the early postwar decades.","There is either a crisis or a return to the norm of stagnation. One view is the norm is stagnation and occasionally you get out of it. The other is that the norm is growth and occasionally you can get into stagnation. You can debate that but it\'s a period of close to global stagnation.","Latin America wants to decriminalize at least marijuana (maybe more or course;) the US wants to maintain it. An interesting story. There seems to me no easy way out of this.","In fact, some leaders come right out and say it. Mario Draghi the president of the European Central Bank had an interview with the Wall St Journal in which he said the social contract\'s dead; we finally got rid of it.","In the US, first of all, the electoral system has been almost totally shredded. For a long time it\'s been pretty much run by private concentrated spending but now it\'s over the top. Elections increasingly over the years have been [public relations] extravaganzas.","The Republican Party has pretty much abandoned any pretense of being a traditional political party. It\'s in lockstep obedience to the very rich, the super rich and the corporate sector. They can\'t get votes that way so they have to mobilize a different constituency. It\'s always been there, but it\'s rarely been mobilized politically. They call it the religious right, but basically it\'s the extreme religious population.","Anarchism means all sort of things to different people but the traditional anarchists\' movements assumed that there\'d be a highly organized society, just one organized from below with direct participation and so on. Actually, one piece of the media confusion has a basis because there really are two different strands in the occupy movement, both important, but different.","Regulate the banks, get money out of elections; raise the minimum wage, environmental issues. They\'re all very important and the Occupy movement made a difference. It shifted not only the discourse but to some extent, action on these issues.","To pay attention to the actual core of the movement - that would be pretty hard. Can you concentrate for example on either the policy issues or the creation of functioning democratic communities of mutual support and say, well, that\'s what\'s lacking in our country that\'s why we don\'t have a functioning democracy - a community of real participation. That\'s really important. And that always gets smashed.","The labor movement had been pretty much killed in the 1920s, almost destroyed. It revived in the 1930s and made a huge difference. By the late 1930s the business world was already trying to find ways to beat it back.","The Media are corporations so... It\'s the concentrations of private power which have an enormous, not total control, but enormous influence over Congress and the White House and that\'s increasing sharply with sharp concentration of private power and escalating cost of elections and so on.","Stock ownership in the US is very highly concentrated. [Shareholder actions are] something, but it\'s like the old Communist Party in the USSR, it would be nice to see more protest inside the Communist Party but it\'s not democracy. It\'s not going to happen. [Shareholder actions] are a good step, but they\'re mostly symbolic.","CEOs pretty much pick the boards that give them salaries and bonuses. That\'s one of the reasons why the CEO-to-payment [ratio] has so sharply escalated in this country in contrast to Europe. (They\'re similar societies and it\'s bad enough there, but here we\'re in the stratosphere. ] There\'s no particular reason for it.","Stakeholders - meaning workers and community - the CEO could just as well be responsible to them. This presupposes there ought to be management but why does there have to be management? Why not have the stakeholders run the industry?","Worker ownership within a state capitalist, semi-market system is better than private ownership but it has inherent problems. Markets have well-known inherent inefficiencies. They\'re very destructive.","The obvious one, in a market system, in a really functioning one, whoever\'s making the decisions doesn\'t pay attention to what are called externalities, effects on others. I sell you a car, if our eyes are open we\'ll make a good deal for ourselves but we\'re not asking how it\'s going to affect her [over there.] It will, there\'ll be more congestion, gas prices will go up, there will be environmental effects and that multiplies over the whole population. Well, that\'s very serious.","You also have to get beyond that to dismantle the system of production for profit rather than production for use. That means dismantling at least large parts of market systems.","If you\'re in a system where you must make profit in order to survive. You are compelled to ignore negative externalities, effects on others.","Markets also have a very bad psychological effect. They drive people to a conception of themselves and society in which you\'re only after your own good, not the good of others and that\'s extremely harmful.","There clearly is a serious race problem in the country. Just take a look at what\'s happening to African American communities. For example wealth, wealth in African American communities is almost zero. The history is striking.","You take a look at the history of African Americans in the US. There\'s been about thirty years of relative freedom. There was a decade after the Civil War and before north/south compact essentially recriminalized black life. During the Second World War there was a need for free labor so there was a freeing up of the labor force. Blacks benefitted from it.","We recriminalized black life. Incarceration rates since the 1908s have gone through the roof, overwhelmingly black males, women and Hispanics to some extent. Essentially re-doing what happened under Reconstruction. That\'s the history of African Americans - so how can any one say there\'s no problem. Sure, racism is serious, but it\'s worse than that.","Suppose I try to say the US carries out terror, in fact it\'s one of the leading terrorist states in the world. You can\'t say that between commercials. People rightly want to know what do you mean. They\'ve never heard that before. Then you have to explain. You have to give background. That\'s exactly what\'s cut out.","When leaders carry out policies for decades that have no consequences for the stated goal and are very costly, you have to ask whether they are telling you the truth or whether the policies are for a different goal, because they are not reducing drug use.","There are a lot of things that can be done within the framework of existing institutions which would be very valuable for people.","There are all the activist groups on every imaginable topic - solidarity groups, environmental and feminist groups - sectors of these movements do very valuable work.","The Soviet Union was pretty much what Lenin and Trotsky said it was.","Western intellectuals, and also Third World intellectuals, were attracted to the Bolshevik counter-revolution because Leninism is, after all, a doctrine which says that the radical intelligentsia have a right to take state power and to run their countries by force, and that is an idea which is rather appealing to intellectuals.","I was in Mexico City. It\'s a very pleasant city in many ways. It\'s vibrant, lively, pretty exciting society, but also depressing in other ways, and sometimes almost hopeless, you know. So it\'s a combination of vibrancy and, I wouldn\'t say despair, but hopelessness, you know. Doesn\'t have to be, but it is. I mean, there is almost no economy.","In fact, I was in a lab that was a hundred percent funded by the Pentagon, and it was one of the centers of the organized antiwar resistance movement.","Go back to classical times, say classical Greece. Who drank the hemlock? Was it someone who was conforming, obeying the gods? Or was it someone who was disrupting the youth and questioning the faith and belief? Socrates, in other words. It was Socrates.","Go back to the Bible, the Old Testament. I mean there were people who we would call intelectuals, there, they were called prophets, but they were basically intelectuals: they were people who were doing critical, geopolitical analysis, talking about the decisions of the king were going to lead to destruction; condemning inmorality, calling for justice for widows and orphans. What we would call dissident intelectuals. Were they nicely treated? No, they were driven into the desert, they were imprisoned, they were denounced. They were intelectuals who conformed.","In Western Europe, Turkey is regarded as uncivilized, so they can\'t come in into the European Union until they\'re civilized. I think it\'s the other way around. If you could achieve the level of civilization of, say, Turkish intelectuals, it would be quite an achievement.","Let\'s take Pravda in the 1980s. I mean you could have read things in Pravda saying that it was a stupid error to invade Afghanistan: \\"it was a dumb thing to do, we have to get out, it\'s costing us too much.\\" I mean that U.S. analog of that would be \\"extreme liberalism,\\" and it has been pretty well studied.","We could not bring democracy and freedom to Vietnam at a cost acceptable to ourselves. The idea that that was what we were trying to do, is again, a tautology, it\'s true by definition because we were doing, and the state is noble by definition. That\'s called \\"extreme liberalism\\".","What\'s called \\"liberal\\" in the intelectual culture means highly conformist to power, but mildly critical.","What the polls don\'t tell you is, though other polls do, is that if you do a study of CEOs, top executives in corporations, they\'re liberal.","I really suggest listening to talk radio. I mean, if you just listen to what the talk hosts are saying, they sound like they are lunatics.","Put yourself in the position of a person, sort of an ordinary American, \\"I\'m a hard-working, god-fearing Christian. I take care of my family, I go to church, I, you know, do everything \'right\'. And I\'m getting shafted. For the last thirty years, my income has stagnated, my working hours are going up, my benefits are going down. My wife has to work two [jobs] to, you know, put food on the table. The children, God, there\'s no care for the children, the schools are rotten, and so on. What did I do wrong? I did everything you\'re supposed to do, but something\'s going wrong to me.","I get terrific health care.","In fact, for the majority of the population, wages and incomes have stagnated and conditions have gotten worse. So they are asking, \\"what did I do wrong?\\" And the answer that the talk show host is giving them is convincing, in it\'s internal logic. It\'s saying, \\"what\'s wrong is the rich liberals own everything, run everything, they don\'t care about you; therefore, distrust them\\" and so on.","Just media alone is not enough. You have to have organization.","I don\'t claim to know a lot about Mexico, but I did talk to quite a number of left Mexican intelectuals, and they all said the same thing. That there\'s a lot of popular, kind of, concern and activism, but it is very fragmented. That the groups have very specific, narrow agendas and they don\'t interact and cooperate with one another. Ok, that\'s something you have to overcome to build a mass popular movement. And that\'s, media can help, but they also benefit from it.","Unless that happens, unless you get, you know, kind of integration of activists\' concerns and movements, it will be, each one will be \'preaching to the choir\'.","Organization and education, when they interact with each other, they strengthen each other, they are mutually supportive.","What matters is what happens among the powerful.","The 1980\'s was the first time in the history of imperialism that people from the imperial society went in substantial numbers to stay with the victims in the hope that their presence would offer some protection and some help. These were not the usual students from elite universities. These were people straight out of middle America.","There are women (some men, too, but mostly women) who are going to the occupied Palestinian territories to stand with the victims of Israeli occupation. These are very courageous Israeli women and some British and American women. That\'s something quite new.","During the 1990\'s, Colombia was the leading recipient of US military aid and training in the hemisphere. Approximately half of all US aid in the hemisphere went to Colombia. Colombia was also far and away the leading human rights violator in the hemisphere.","Today, aid to Colombia is given under the pretext of a drug war. That\'s pretty hard to take seriously. Ten years ago, Amnesty International flatly called it a myth.","Colombia was a big wheat producer in the 1950\'s. That was eliminated by what sounds like a nice plan, called \\"Food for Peace. \\" It\'s a plan by which US taxpayers subsidized US agribusiness to send food to poor countries. This, of course, destroyed the domestic agricultural markets of these countries, opening these markets to US agribusiness.","A big producer can survive price fluctuations on the world market. A small farmer can\'t.","It\'s not in doubt that tobacco is far more lethal than hard drugs.","The whole basis for the US intervention in Colombia is outrageously racist and arrogant.","Stability means you do what we say, and what we say is that Colombia and the resources of the Andean region shall be freely available to the rich and powerful of the world, particularly US-based multinational corporations.","The US reasserted control over Nicaragua in 1990. Since then, the country has experienced a steep decline. It\'s now the second poorest country in the hemisphere.","No one is concerned with Central America anymore. If a million people are facing starvation in northern Nicaragua and Honduras, it\'s none of our business. Few people even recognize that this situation is in part an outgrowth of US policies going back to the 1980\'s. Nobody is concerned because Nicaragua is technically stable.","It\'s fine to criticize somebody else\'s crimes and misdeeds, but you don\'t talk about your own. The only exception is a country that is defeated. And even that is rather nuanced.","Take Germany and Japan, both defeated in the Second World War. Germany has acknowledged its monstrous crimes to a certain extent, has paid reparations and so on. Japan, in contrast, apologizes for nothing and has paid no reparations, with one exception: It pays reparations to the United States, but not to Asia.","The development of space technology, including space warfare today, is similar in its technological-industrial significance to the development of navies a hundred years ago.","If you look at say, England and Germany a century ago, which had the most advanced navies then, they were dealing with extremely tricky technological problems. Putting a huge gun on a moving platform and ensuring that it could hit another moving target was one of the hardest technical problems of the early twentieth century.","We\'re looking at the dawn of a new arms race. For example, Germany technically opposes the US space militarization program, but is bound to get involved. Otherwise it will be left behind in the development of advanced technology. Germany understands that very well. The US understands it too, and they fully expect that Germany and other countries that they want on board will go along with the program.","In fact, the Outer Space Treaty of 1967 bans militarization. Potential adversaries of the US, and even its allies, are so far behind that these countries are very interested in maintaining the treaty. Europe and the rest of the world want a strong reaffirmation of the Treaty and the US is unilaterally trying to derail it. Termination of the treaty would mean that the US could develop satellite weapons, put offensive weapons in space. It would probably mean using nuclear power in space. All of this leads to some very dangerous scenarios, including destruction of the species.","Destruction of the environment is not only rational; it\'s exactly what you\'re taught to do in college.","If you take an economics or a political science course, you\'re taught that humans are supposed to be rational wealth accumulators, each acting as an individual to maximize his own wealth in the market.","The market is regarded as democratic because everybody has a vote. Of course, some have more votes than others because your votes depend on the number of dollars you have, but everybody participates and therefore it\'s called democratic.","If you accept the institutional lunacy, then the policies are rational.","Pakistan will never be able to match the Indian militarily and the effort to do so is taking an immense toll on the society. It\'s also extremely dangerous with all the weapons development.","There is Pakistan\'s relationship with Afghanistan which will also be a very tricky issue in the coming years. Then there is a large part of Pakistan which is being torn apart from American drone attacks. The country is being invaded constantly by a terrorist superpower. Again, this is not a small problem.","Historically, several policy domains, including that of foreign policy towards the US and India, budget allocations etc, have been controlled by the Pakistani military, and the civil-military divide can be said to be the most fundamental fracture in Pakistan\'s body politic.","Balochistan, and to some extent Sindh too, has a general feeling that they are not part of the decision-making process in Pakistan and are ruled by a Punjabi dictatorship. There is a lot of exploitation of the rich resources [in Balochistan] which the locals are not gaining from. As long as this goes on, it is going to keep providing grounds for serious uprisings and insurgencies.","I can understand the idea that there is a conspiracy. In fact, in much of the world there is a sense of an ultra-powerful CIA manipulating everything that happens, such as running the Arab Spring, running the Pakistani Taliban, etc. That is just nonsense. They [CIA] created a monster and now they are appalled by it.","Travel from what is called Pakistan to Afghanistan has been made increasingly difficult and people are often labelled terrorists, even those who might be just visiting families.","There was a striking example of this in Pakistan when the US sent in Special Forces, to be honest, to kill Osama Bin Laden. He could easily have been apprehended and caught but their orders were to kill him.","As a health scientist at Columbia University, Les Roberts, pointed out, sooner or later people are going to be looking at a child in a wheelchair suffering from polio and will say \'the Americans did that to him\'. So they continue policies which have similar effects i.e. organising the Taliban. This will come back to them too.","When I was growing up in the 1930s and \'40s anti-Semitism was rampant. It wasn\'t like Nazi Germany but it was pretty serious - it was part of life.","It\'s a lesser-known story, but the Japanese government (after the Russian-Nazi pact, which split Poland) did allow Polish Jews to come to Japan, with the expectation that they would then be sent to the United States. But they weren\'t accepted, so they stayed in Japan.","There\'s an interesting book called The Fugu Plan, written by Marvin Tokayer and Mary Swartz, which describes the circumstances when European Jews came to Japan, a semi-feudal society.","After World War II there were many Jews who remained in refugee camps...President Harry F. Truman called for the Harrison Commission to investigate the situation in the camps and it was a pretty gloomy report. There were very few Jews admitted into the United States.","The Zionist movement based in Palestine pretty much took over the camps and instituted the policy that every man and woman between the ages of seventeen and thirty-five should be directed to Palestine - not allowed to go to the West.","A 1998 study was done in Hebrew by an Israeli scholar, Yosef Grodzinsky, and the English translation of the title is Good Human Material. That\'s what they wanted sent to Palestine for colonization and for the eventual conflict that took place some years later. These policies were somewhat complementary to the U.S. policy of pressuring England to allow Jews to go to Palestine, but not allowing them here. The British politician Ernest Bevin was quite bitter about it, asking, \\"if you want to save the Jews, why send them to Palestine when you don\'t admit them?\\"","When Nazi emissaries came to the United States, they were welcomed at Harvard.","George Kennan is another extreme case. He was the American consul in Berlin until the war between Germany and the United States broke out in December 1941. And until then he was writing pretty supportive statements back stressing that we shouldn\'t be so hard on the Nazis if they were doing something we didn\'t agree with - basically repeating the idea that they were people we could do business with.","There\'s a strong nativist tradition - saying, \\"we have to protect ourselves\\" - that comes from the founding of the country. If you read Benjamin Franklin, who was one of the leading figures of the Enlightenment in the United States and the most distinguished representative of the movement here, he actually advised that the newly founded republic should block Germans and Swedes because they were too \\"swarthy\\" - dark.","There\'s a strange myth of Anglo-Saxonism. When the University of Virginia was founded by Thomas Jefferson, for example, its law school offered the study of \\"Anglo-Saxon Law.\\" And that myth of Anglo-Saxonism carries right over into the early twentieth century.","Just recently, the administration of Barack Obama, which has broken all sorts of records in regards to deportation, picked up a Guatemalan man living here [in U.S]. I think he had been living here for twenty-five years, had a family, a business, and so on. He had fled from the Mayan region and they picked him up and deported him. To me, that\'s really sick.","I also learned from reading the left-wing press about the [Franklin] Roosevelt administration\'s indirect support for Francisco Franco, which was not well known, and still isn\'t.","It was reported in the left-wing press in the late 1930s that the Texas Company (Texaco), headed by the Nazi sympathizer Torkild Rieber, diverted its oil shipments from the Republic, with which it had contracts, to [Francisco] Franco.","You can read it in history books now, but they often suppress the fact that the U.S. government tolerated [Nazi]. It\'s really remarkable because they claim that [Franklin] Roosevelt was impeded by the Neutrality Act. On the other hand, he bitterly condemned a Mexican businessman for sending several guns to the Republic. If you look back, oil was the one commodity that [Francisco] Franco could not receive from the Germans and the Italians, so that was quite significant.","During the terrorist regime in Haiti in the 1990s, the CIA, under the administration of Bill Clinton, was reporting to Congress that oil shipments had been blocked from entering Haiti. That was just a lie. I was there. You could see the oil terminals being built and the ships coming in.","It turned out that [Bill] Clinton had authorized Texaco to illegally ship oil to the military junta [in Haiti] during a time when we were supposedly opposing the military junta and supporting democracy instead.","If you look at the Associated Press wires, there\'s a constant flow of information coming in. At that time I happened to have direct access to AP wires. The day the marines landed in Haiti and restored [ Jan B\xe8tran] Aristide there was a lot of excitement about the dedication to democracy and so on. But the day before the marines landed, when every journalist was looking at Haiti because it was assumed that something big was happening, the AP wires reported that then [Bill] Clinton administration had authorized Texaco to ship oil illegally to the military junta.","The communists were mainly responsible for the destruction of the Spanish anarchists. Not just in Catalonia - the communist armies mainly destroyed the collectives elsewhere.","The communists basically acted as the police force of the security system of the [Spain] Republic and were very much opposed to the anarchists, partially because [Joseph] Stalin still hoped at that time to have some kind of pact with Western countries against [Adolf] Hitler. That, of course, failed and Stalin withdrew the support to the Republic. They even withdrew the Spanish gold reserves.","[Francisco Franco] said they should resort to guerrilla war. Which has a history in Spain.","The American Revolution was a small part of a major world war going on between France and England, so the French intervened and that was a big factor, but the domestic contribution was basically guerrilla warfare.","George Washington hated the guerrillas. He wanted to imitate the British red coat armies, fighting as gentlemen are supposed to fight.","When I am at home, I never watch TV, but when I am abroad in a hotel I take a look at the BBC to find out what\'s going on.","Many of the people who voted for Trump were people who voted for Obama eight years ago. You remember, of course, his message was \\"hope and change.\\" People wanted change, for good reasons, and they wanted hope. Disillusioned with what took place, they turned to someone else who was offering hope and change. When they\'re disillusioned with that, it depends on what activists and others do.","The desire for hope and change is easily understandable. In many ways it\'s even more dramatic in Europe.","I think there are real possibilities of reaching out to many of the Trump voters, those who voted for Obama believing his rhetoric.","Trump\'s principal policies make clear what\'s going to happen. This gives an opportunity. Right now it\'s going to take hard work, but it\'s possible that there could be a real revival of the labor movement.","Labor has been severely undermined, but that\'s happened before. In the 1920s, the labor movement was virtually crushed, in large part by Wilson\'s Red Scare, but it dramatically revived in the 1930s. It spearheaded the social-democratic New-Deal style changes which were beneficial to the country - not sufficient, but beneficial. That could happen again.","Melting of the huge Antarctic glaciers, proceeding more rapidly than anticipated, threatens a rise in sea level that will drive tens of millions from the low-lying plains of Bangladesh alone, with disastrous consequences elsewhere.","The world was warned of extremely severe dangers unless urgent steps are taken to deal with global warming.","What is important to us is to reverse the shameful course being pursued by America. It won\'t be easy, but it must and can be done.","There are real possibilities of reaching many of the Trump voters: many of them in fact voted for Obama, believing his rhetoric about \\"change,\\" and upon realizing that they were deluded, have turned to Trump. And will find that they are again deluded. That\'s an opportunity that can be grasped, by organizing, education, activism right now.","A more appropriate expansion is the statement \\"it is the responsibility of intellectuals to speak the truth and expose lies\\" a transcript of a talk to a writers conference in Australia in 1996, where I had been asked to talk on \\"writers and intellectual responsibility\\" - a question that I said I found \\"puzzling,\\" because I knew of nothing to say about it beyond truisms, though these were perhaps worth affirming because they are \\"so commonly denied, if not in words, then in consistent practice.\\"","I don\'t suggest that the observations are surprising or profound. Rather, they seem to me the merest truisms. I was not aware that [ Michel] Foucault had used the phrase \\"speaking truth to power.\\" I had thought it was an old Quaker phrase.","I don\'t entirely agree with the slogan \\"speaking truth to power.\\"","It also seems beyond controversy that moral responsibilities are greater to the extent that people \\"have the resources, the training, the facilities and opportunities to speak and act effectively.\\"","If commissars in Soviet Russia agreed to subordinate themselves to state power, they could at least plead fear in extenuation. Their counterparts in more free and open societies can plead only cowardice.","The intellectual is an individual with a specific public role in society that cannot be reduced simply to . . a faceless professional.","Edward Said is a very honorable representative of the \\"intellectual\\" in the sense of the term that he defines.","That is [Edward Said] proposal as to how the term should be used. It surely does not describe those who are called \\"intellectuals\\" in standard usage, as he would be the first to agree.","Intellectuals (in the standard sense of the term, not [ Edward] Said\'s prescriptive sense) are the people who write history.","If the authors and custodians of history turn out to have an attractive image, it is only reasonable to look beyond and ask whether the image they construct is accurate.","I think such an inquiry will reveal a rather different picture: namely, it will reveal a very strong tendency for the intellectuals who are respected and privileged to be those who subordinate themselves to power.","To use the terms that are reserved for official enemies, it is the commissars and apparatchiks, not the dissidents, who are respected and privileged within their own societies.","I know of people whose actions and words I admire and respect. Some are called \\"intellectuals,\\" some are not.","History records endless struggles to enlarge those realms, inspiring ones; it also records painful reversals and setbacks.","What can realistically be done depends on the historical moment. The same is true with regard to the agents.","In general, we should be able to agree that those who have greater opportunities and face fewer impediments have a greater responsibility to do more to help achieve such ends.","Those of us lucky enough to have a share of privilege in the more free societies should not be asking this question, but doing something to answer it.","I wouldn\'t say that the efforts of academics to critique the media\'s messages are \\"half-hearted.\\" As far as I am aware, the efforts scarcely exist: very few even pay attention to the question.","People who spend their working hours in a lab or research library or a classroom might be intent primarily on keeping or advancing their elite positions, thereby lending tacit support to power structures. Or they might not be.","Anyone in a position to overcome barriers to free thought and communication should do so.","The book Manufacturing Consent, which I co-authored with Edward Herman, begins with a description of the structure and institutional setting of the commercial media, and then draws some rather simple-minded conclusions about what we would expect the media product to be, given these (not particularly controversial) conditions.","The book [Manufacturing Consent] itself is then devoted to a series of case studies, selected, we hope [with Edward Herman], to offer a fair and in fact rather severe test of those conclusions.","We [ with Edward Herman] believe that the empirical evidence we review there - and elsewhere, in a great deal of joint and separate work - lends substantial support to the conclusions; whether that is true is for others to judge.","As we [with Edward Herman] discuss there [in Manufacturing Consent] and elsewhere, recognition of the importance of \\"manufacturing consent\\" has become an ever more central theme in the more free societies.","An unstated but crucial premise is that the \\"responsible men\\" achieve that exalted status by their service to authentic power, a fact of life that they will discover soon enough if they try to pursue an independent path.","Unaccountable private power concentrations that dominate economic and social life have the means to seek to \\"regiment the public mind,\\" and become \\"tools and tyrants\\" of government, in James Madison\'s memorable phrase, as he warned of the threats he discerned to the democratic experiment if private powers were granted free rein.","Since James Madison day (and long before), there have been constant struggles over \\"democratic governance\\".","Should people be mere \\"interested spectators of action,\\" not \\"participants,\\" restricted to lending their weight periodically to one or another sector of the \\"responsible men,\\" as advocates of \\"manufacture of consent\\" have recommended? Or should their rights transcend these highly restricted bounds?","Sometimes the former forces are in the ascendance, and \\"democratic governance\\" is eroded, though anyone familiar with intellectual history would expect that the slogans will be passionately proclaimed as they are drained of substantive content. We happen to be living in such an era, but as often before, there is no reason to suppose that the process is irreversible.","What is failure for some is success for others. It depends on where they stand in the struggles over \\"democratic governance\\" and related rights - civil, social and economic, and broadly cultural, to adopt the framework of the Universal Declaration that is formally endorsed but constantly undermined.","It is only natural to expect that guilds will tend to \\"protect their turf\\" and to resist challenge.","The tendencies are considerably weaker in the natural sciences, which, for the past several centuries, have survived and flourished through such constant challenge, and therefore, at best, seek to encourage it. Serving the status quo in political and socioeconomic realms is a different matter.","I don\'t really see what can be said about the role of faculty members, or universities, beyond the truisms voiced earlier, and their elaboration in various domains, ranging from focused intellectual pursuits to the concerns of the larger society and future generations.","About specific social issues, there is a great deal to say that departs very far from truism and is, accordingly, significant and controversial.","There is extensive critical scholarship that provides illustrations in many areas of scholarship. I\'ve discussed many cases myself, while also citing and often relying on academic studies that disentangle these webs of mystification woven for the general public. It\'s impossible to provide illustrations that would even approach accuracy, let alone carry any conviction, without going well beyond the bounds of this discussion.","That intellectuals, including academics, would become a \\"new class\\" of technocrats, claiming the name of science while cooperating with the powerful, was predicted by [Mikhail] Bakunin in the early days of the formation of the modern intelligentsia in the 19th century.","Pascal in his bitter rendition of the practices of the Jesuit intellectuals he despised, including their demonstration of \\"the utility of interpretation,\\" a device of manufacturing consent based on reinterpretation of sacred texts to serve wealth, power, and privilege.","[Isaiah] Berlin\'s observation is accurate enough, and applies at home as well, and even more harshly for the reasons already mentioned: the apparatchiks and commissars could at least plead fear in extenuation.","The beam in our own eye is harder to detect, although - or more accurately because - to detect it, and remove it, is vastly more important on elementary moral grounds, and commonly more important in terms of direct human consequences as well. Intellectuals have historically played a critical function in performing these tasks, and [Ivan] Illich is right to observe that claims to scientific expertise and special knowledge are often used as a device.","Those who actually do have a valid claim to such special competence have a particular obligation to make very clear to the general public the limits of what is understood at any serious level; these limits are typically very narrow in matters of significance in human affairs.","I pretend no originality in observing that mass education was motivated in part by the perceived need to \\"educate them to keep them from our throats,\\" to borrow Ralph Waldo Emerson\'s parody of elite fears that inspired early advocates of public mass education.","The attack on Social Security is similarly motivated. Social Security is based on the conception is that we should have sympathy for others, not function merely as isolated \\"rational wealth maximizers.\\"","As elite attitudes towards public education over time illustrate, simple formulas are far from adequate. There are conflicting tendencies.","In the sciences particularly the large public universities must and do take an active role in fostering creativity and independence; otherwise the fields will wither, and along with them even the aspirations of wealth and power.","In my experience at least, the large public universities do not fall behind in fostering creativity and independence; often the contrary.","The focus on creativity and independence exists in pockets of resistance in the educational system, which, to thrive, should be integrated with the needs and concerns of the great majority of the population. One finds them everywhere.","Dissidents are not imprisoned as in the domains of the Kremlin, in the old days. They do not have their brains blown out by elite forces armed and trained by the reigning superpower, as happens in Washington\'s domains - with no particular concern at home - an important fact, one of many that help us learn about ourselves, if we choose.","No use in waiting, we can all work hard to bring about changes.","My memory - faded, as I say - is that Paul Johnson was trying to vilify all intellectuals who were at all critical of the states he worships, and of power generally (except, of course, the power of enemies, which we must denounce, imitating the commissars who are his models, though he doesn\'t understand it).","Another recollection is that [ Paul Johnson] mostly kept away from ideas and dedicated activism, and concentrated on sex lives and other gossip.","You have to rely on yourself and your associates - gifts don\'t come from above; you\'re going to win them, or you won\'t have them.","You win by struggle, and that requires understanding and serious analysis of the options and the circumstances, and then you can do a lot.","I listen to talk radio a lot and it\'s kind of interesting. If you can sort of suspend your knowledge of the world and just enter into the world of the people who are calling in, you can understand them.","I\'ve never seen a study, but my sense is that these are people who feel really aggrieved. These people think, \\"I\'ve done everything right all my life, I\'m a god-fearing Christian, I\'m white, I\'m male, I\'ve worked hard, and I carry a gun. I do everything I\'m supposed to do. And I\'m getting shafted.\\" And in fact they are getting shafted. For 30 years their wages have stagnated or declined, the social conditions have worsened, the children are going crazy, there are no schools, there\'s nothing, so somebody must be doing something to them, and they want to know who it is.","Rush Limbaugh has answered - it\'s the rich liberals who own the banks and run the government, and of course run the media, and they don\'t care about you - they just want to give everything away to illegal immigrants and gays and communists and so on.","The reaction we should be having to [rich liberals] is not ridicule, but rather self-criticism. Why aren\'t we organizing them? I mean, we are the ones that ought to be organizing them, not Rush Limbaugh. There are historical analogs, which are not exact, of course, but are close enough to be worrisome. This is a whiff of early Nazi Germany.","There are historical analogs, which are not exact, of course, but are close enough to be worrisome. This is a whiff of early Nazi Germany. [Adolf] Hitler was appealing to groups with similar grievances, and giving them crazy answers, but at least they were answers; these groups weren\'t getting them anywhere else. It was the Jews and the Bolsheviks [that were the problem].","I don\'t even know if I ever knew - some sweatshop in Baltimore. I knew with my other relatives - some of the women were in the International Ladies\' Garment Workers\' Union and men were shop boys and things like that. I happened to be in Philadelphia, but the family was in New York. I could see what the union was doing for them.It really saved their lives.","I had two spinster aunts who were seamstresses, and of course unemployed in the 1930s, but the union gave them a life. They had a couple of weeks in the country for a union installation and they had educational programs and all sorts of things. There was a life, you know, a real community.","When [Bill] Clinton came along, it sort of moderated a little bit, but Clinton had a different device for breaking unions called NAFTA [North America Free Trade Agreement]. Because the government was entirely lawless, employers could exploit NAFTA to threaten union organizers with transfer. It\'s illegal, but when you\'ve got a lawless government, it doesn\'t matter if it\'s illegal. I think the number of union drives blocked increased by about 50 percent.","Part of the NAFTA legislation required studies of labor practices, and there was quite a good study that came out by a labor historian on the use of NAFTA to undermine and destroy unions.","Starting with [Ronald] Regan it became quite open, the attack on unions. It wasn\'t the Pinkertons anymore, but it was just not applying the laws.","They [unions] used straight Marxist rhetoric [in 1930s] - just the values were changed.","The literature is like that - they [unions] are constantly talking about the masses, the danger they pose, and how to control them. They understand what they\'re doing, and they\'re very class conscious. They press policies which work for their interests.","For example, the insurance industries and the big banks are absolutely euphoric now - on the business pages they don\'t even conceal it - because they\'ve succeeded in coming out of the crisis even stronger than they were before, and in a better position to lay the basis for the next crisis. But they don\'t care, because they\'ll get bailed out again. That\'s class consciousness with a vengeance.","In fact, a rather striking aspect of business propaganda in the United States is the demonization of government, starting after the Second World War.","The Second World War ended with a radicalization of the population in the United States and everywhere else, and called for all kinds of things like popular takeovers, government intervention, and worker takeovers of factories. Business propagated a tremendous propaganda offensive. The scale surprised me when I read the scholarship - it\'s enormous, and it\'s been very effective. There were two major targets: one is unions, the other is democracy.","In a democracy the day when you pay your taxes, April 15, would be a day of celebration, because you\'re getting together to provide resources for the programs you decided on.","In the United States, the day when you pay your taxes is a day of mourning because this alien force - the government - is coming to rob you of your hard-earned money. That\'s the general attitude, and it\'s a tremendous victory for the opponents of democracy, and, of course, any privileged sector is going to hate democracy. You can see it in the healthcare debate.","The majority of the population thinks that if the government runs healthcare, they\'re going to take away your freedom. At the same time, the public favors a national healthcare program.","You have to love that government, but hate the government that might work in your interest and that you could control. That\'s an interesting propaganda task, but it\'s been carried out very well.","You can see it in the worship of [Ronald] Reagan, which portrays him as somebody who saved us from government. Actually he was an apostle of big government.","Government grew under [Ronald] Reagan. He was the strongest opponent of free markets in the post-war history among presidents. But it doesn\'t matter what the reality is; they concocted an image that you worship.","Peter Kropotkin was surely on the left. He was one of the founders of what is now called \'sociobiology\' or \'evolutionary psychology\' with his book Mutual Aid, arguing that human nature had evolved in ways conducive to the communitarian anarchism that he espoused.","In fact, anyone who merits attention and who promotes any cause at all is doing so on the basis of a belief that it is somehow good for humans, because of their inherent nature.","There is nothing more mysterious about the concept human nature than about the concept bee or chicken nature, at least for those who regard humans as creatures in the biological world.","I have never suggested any principled difference between the natural and social sciences.","What is the nature of the genetic endowment? How does acquisition proceed? Etc. Scientists do routinely ask similar questions about the visual system, system of motor organisation, and others - including, in fact, the digestive system.","It\'s a mistake to suppose that capacities must evolve gradually. There are many known examples of sharp changes - slight genetic modification that yields substantial phenotypic effects, and much else.","The human digestive and visual systems did clearly evolve over a very long period.","While language can surely be used for communication (as can much else), communication probably has no special role in its design or evolution.","A property of an organism enters into its life (and survival) in many different ways, some more salient than others. But there is no simple notion of its being \\"for\\" some function.","It\'s commonly assumed that the emergence of language was a key element of the great leap. We of course know very little about the sociopolitical conditions that existed at the time, but there\'s no scenario I can think of that suggests how a sudden change in these conditions could have led to the emergence of language.","There isn\'t much doubt that like other animal societies, those of Homo sapiens involved plenty of cooperation, which might have been considerably enhanced, one would suppose, by the emergence of the remarkable instrument of language.","No one seriously doubts that if Piraha children are brought up in Boston they\'ll be speaking Boston English, that is, that the capacities are present, unlike other animals, as far as is known. There\'s no challenge to the theory - not mine, but everyone\'s - that the human language faculty provides the means for generation of an infinite array of structured expressions.","I have not suggested that the emergence of language is instantaneous. Rather, that the rewiring of the brain enabling an infinite array of structured expressions was in effect instantaneous. I have never heard of an alternative to this suggestion.","Evolutionary theory has nothing to say, in general, as to whether cheating is more advantageous than cooperating. There are many circumstances in which the contrary would be true, and empirical evidence, though it exists, has little bearing on real situations.","Of course language arose in a Darwinian biological world, because that\'s all there is, but that world relates only superficially to the pop-biology that circulates informally.","I don\'t encourage socialists or anarchists to accept falsehoods, in particular, to see revolutionary potential where there is none.","No sane human being devotes 100% of his or her life to political activism.","If scientists and scholars were to become \\"collectively self-organised and consciously activist\\" today, they would probably devote themselves to service to state and private power. Those who have different goals should (and do) become organized and activist.","The Left, in a general sense, is very much atomized. We live in highly atomized societies. People are pretty much alone; it\'s you and your iPad.","The major organizing centers, like the labor movement, have been severely weakened in the United States by policy.","Capitalism would self-destruct in no time. So the business classes have always demanded strong, straight intervention to protect the society from the destructive effects of market forces because they don\'t want everything destroyed.","Let\'s take Adam Smith, the patron-saint of capitalism, what did he think? He thought the main human instinct was sympathy. In fact, take a look at the word \\"invisible hand.\\" Which, of course, you learned about, or you think you\'ve learned about. Take a look at the actual way in which he used the phrase. There is almost no relation to what is claimed.","Adam Smith is an egalitarian, he believed in equality of outcome, not opportunity. He is an enlightenment figure, pre-capitalist. He says, suppose in England, one landowner got most of the land and other people would have nothing to live on. He says it wouldn\'t matter much, because the rich land owner, by virtue of his sympathy for other people would distribute resources among them, so that by an invisible hand, we would end up with a pretty egalitarian society. That is his conception of human nature.","This is a large part of the academic profession: to make up complex, subtle arguments that are childishly ridiculous but are enveloped in sufficient profundity that they take on a kind of plausibility.","In America, we will use force whenever we like against anyone we regard as a potential threat, and maybe we will delegate that right to clients, but it\'s not for others.","Orwell says straight, look, in England what comes out in a free country is not very different from this totalitarian monster that I\'m describing in the book. It\'s more or less the same. How come in a free country? He has two sentences, which are pretty accurate. One, he says, the press is owned by wealthy men who have every reason not to want certain ideas to be expressed. And second - and I think this is much more important - a good education instills in you the intuitive understanding that there are certain things it just wouldn\'t do to say.","Human physical structures and intellectual structures are generally studied in different ways. The assumption is that physical structures are genetically inherited and intellectual structures are learned. I think that this assumption is wrong. None of these structures is learned. They all grow; they grow in comparable ways; their ultimate forms are heavily dependent on genetic predispositions.","I don\'t think you would have any trouble at all in deciding that you are thinking of some event and then visualizing it happening with its consequences, and constructing a rational analysis of it without being able to verbalize it adequately in anything like its full complexity.","I don\'t think all thinking is a kind of rational structure. But I don\'t think it is correct to identify the rational-nonrational dichotomy with the linguistic-nonlinguistic dichotomy.","There is a narrow class of uses of language where you intend to communicate. Communication refers to an effort to get people to understand what one means. And that, certainly, is one use of language and a social use of it. But I don\'t think it is the only social use of language. Nor are social uses the only uses of language.","I think the most important work that is going on has to do with the search for very general and abstract features of what is sometimes called universal grammar: general properties of language that reflect a kind of biological necessity rather than logical necessity; that is, properties of language that are not logically necessary for such a system but which are essential invariant properties of human language and are known without learning. We know these properties but we don\'t learn them. We simply use our knowledge of these properties as the basis for learning.","You can imagine a different world in which a number of species developed with different genetically determined linguistic systems. It hasn\'t happened in evolution. What has happened is that one species has developed, and the genetic structure of this species happens to involve a variety of intricate abstract principles of linguistic organization that, therefore, necessarily constrain every language, and, in fact, create the basis for learning language as a way of organizing experience rather than constituting something learned from experience.","One thing that you and I know is language. Another thing that you and I know is how objects behave in perceptual space. We have a whole mass of complex ways of understanding what is the nature of visual space. A proper part of psychology ought to be, and in recent years has been, an effort to try to discover the principles of how we organize visual space. I would say that the same is true of every domain of psychology, of human studies.","I think that as human beings, we quite naturally take for granted what is similar among human beings and, then, pay attention to what differentiates us. That makes perfect sense for us as human beings.","Physics and those parts of other fields that grow out of physics - chemistry, the structure of big molecules - in those domains, there is a lot of progress. In many other domains, there is very little progress in developing real scientific understanding.","There is no evolutionary pressure to create minds capable of forming sciences; it just happened. Evolutionary pressure has not led to higher rates of reproduction for people capable of solving scientific problems or creating new scientific ideas. So if, in fact, the science-forming capacities evolved for other reasons, it would not be too surprising if those particular structures that have developed proved to be rather special in their nature, reflecting the contingencies of their evolution or the working of physical law.","To construct a scientific theory from the data and to be able to recognize that it is a reasonable theory is possible only if there are some very sharp restrictive principles that lead you to go in one direction and not in another direction. Otherwise, you wouldn\'t have science at all, merely randomly chosen hypotheses.","The very properties of the human mind that provide an enormous scope for human genius in some domains will serve as barriers to progress in other domains, just as the properties that enable each child to acquire a complex and highly articulated human language block the acquisition of other imaginable linguistic systems.","I think the Christian Coalition could be extremely dangerous. We should always be concerned when any group wants to impose their doctrinal concerns on all. To an extent that\'s what they are trying to do.","If the NAACP were to impose a control of something towards all, then I would staunchly oppose it.","Take, say, the solidarity movement in Central America, which I think is what you probably had in mind. To a large extent, it comes out of mainstream Christianity, based on beliefs that have had outrageous human consequences in the past, and that I think are totally indefensible. In this case, they happen to lead to some of the most courageous, heroic, and honourable human action that\'s taking place anywhere in the world. Well, that\'s how life is, I guess. It doesn\'t come in neat little packages.","America is a very fundamentalist society. It\'s like Iran in the degree of fanatic religious commitment.","Andorrans deserve much better than the rule of superstitious hysterics and extreme authoritarians, who try to instill obedience to their Holy Texts and chosen Divinities - and we should not fail to see that the terms are appropriate, if anything too kind.","I was told by journalists who can\'t publish it that there are in Mexico, close to the U.S. border, big areas that used to be devoted to agriculture that are now devoted to poppies. They say you can\'t get in there because they\'re guarded, first by the cartels, but also by the army, which goes hand in hand with the cartels.","In fact, when drugs are legalized, use sometimes goes down, it\'s been claimed. Part of the reason is that teenage kids use illicit drugs because they are illicit. They are thumbing their noses at society. If they were legal, they might not.","Should a community... be free to enact legislation to say they don\'t want blacks? Now that\'s illegal. Fifty years ago it was legal. Is that progress or is that regress?","In the United States everyone is an illegal immigrant - everyone except the people in Indian Reservations. This is an immigrant society.","Free markets are based on the free circulation of labor. If you don\'t have free circulation of labor, you don\'t have free markets.","Cuba forces in Angola gave a real shot in the arm to the liberation movements, and it also was a lesson to the white South Africans that the end is coming. They can\'t just hope to subdue the continent on racist grounds.","The earthquake in Haiti was a class-based catastrophe. It didn\'t much harm the wealthy elite up in the hills, they were shaken but not destroyed. On the other hand the people who were living in the miserable urban slums, huge numbers of them, they were devastated. Maybe a couple hundred thousand were killed. How come they were living there? They were living there because of-it goes back to the French colonial system-but in the past century, they were living there because of US policies, consistent policies.","Well, they really didn\'t have to worry, because the way power politics works, the World Court can\'t do anything. Look, there\'s one country in the world at the moment which has refused to accept World Court decision-that\'s the United States. Is anybody going to do anything about it?","We live in this world, not another one that we\'d prefer, and sometimes it\'s necessary to follow painful paths if we hope to provide at least a little help for suffering people.","The UN can go as far as the U.S. will allow, and no further. And it\'s bound by conditions that the powerful states, which means mostly the U.S., impose.","The UN to some extent diffuses U.S. power. Therefore it\'s less direct an agency of the United States than the U.S. Army is. But still, it can\'t escape the distribution of power in the world.","As far as Marx\'s analysis of capitalism, there\'s a lot of very useful ideas in it, but he\'s developing an abstract model of 19th century capitalism. It\'s abstract and it\'s changed.","In a really business-run society like the United States, the business elites are deeply committed to class struggle and are engaged in it all the time. They\'re instinctive Marxists.","Procurement is a major technique of state subsidy.","The IMF economists were doubtless shaken by the extreme failures of their prescriptions over many years, and by the collapse of the intellectual edifice of economic theory on which they were relying.","After all, the internet originated around 1960 and wasn\'t privatized until 1995. That\'s thirty five years in the public domain during the hard, creative development period.","I don\'t know what it means to say that \'the internet should have a voice in Washington\'.","Technology can also be used so that private individuals will have access to the way centralized decisions are being made.","Wikileaks is a democratizing force. Its giving individuals access to decisions and thinking by their representatives and in a democracy that ought to be reflexive.","But on the contrary Wikileaks is under heavy attack by the government and corporations are participating in that by closing down their websites.","Long before the technology revolution there was declassification of documents and I\'ve spent quite a lot of time studying declassified internal documents and written a lot about them. In fact, anybody who\'s worked through the declassified record can see very clearly that the reason for classification is very rarely to protect the state or the society from enemies. Most of the time it is to protect the state from its citizens, so they don\'t know what the government is doing.","Should we even have the classification system? Why shouldn\'t these things be open? There are things you want to keep secret, like the characteristics of your latest fighter plane or something like that.","Most of what is done I think is to kept secret so the public won\'t know. The same is true of what Wikileaks exposed.","What Wikileaks exposed is kind of superficial in a way.","Say the Pentagon Papers, - that material went much deeper. It went into internal government planning back for twenty - five years. Those are things that the public should have known about. In a democracy they should have known what leaders thinking and planning about major enterprises like the Vietnam war. It was kept secret from them.","Wikileaks is providing information on what ambassadors are sending to Washington and things like that. Maybe some of that has a right to some kind of secrecy, but there is a heavy burden and I think its pretty hard to meet. I haven\'t read everything from Wikileaks by any means but the parts that I have read and seen I think are things the public should know.","The threat is that the public will know what the government is up to. Any system of power is going to want to keep free from public surveillance, that\'s natural. Its shouldn\'t be but, its very natural.","One of the benefits of a properly functioning democracy is minority rights and majority rule.","Its minority rule and majority limited rights. In fact it\'s set up that way. If you read the framers of the constitution, including James Madison, he was pretty clear about it.","The senate was wealthy people and it wasn\'t elected, it was chosen through legislatures, which themselves were under private influence, powerful influence. They were remote from the population and that\'s where power was suppose to reside.","The House of Representatives, which was closer to the population, had much less power. The executive was more or less an administrator, not an emperor like today.","[James] Madison pointed out in the discussion of the constitutional debates - the constitutional convention - that democracy would be a danger. He used England of course as the model and said suppose that in England everyone had the free right to vote; the poor, the propertyless - who are the great majority - would use their voting power to take away the rights of property owners to carry out what we would call land reform.","There have been repeated cases when nuclear war came ominously close, often a result of malfunctioning of early-warning systems and other accidents, sometimes [as a result of] highly adventurist acts of political leaders.","As for climate change, it\'s by now widely accepted by the scientific community that we have entered a new geological era, the Anthropocene, in which the Earth\'s climate is being radically modified by human action, creating a very different planet, one that may not be able to sustain organized human life in anything like a form we would want to tolerate.","There is good reason to believe that we have already entered the Sixth Extinction, a period of destruction of species on a massive scale, comparable to the Fifth Extinction 65 million years ago, when three-quarters of the species on earth were destroyed, apparently by a huge asteroid.","Sea level rise and destruction of water resources as glaciers melt alone may have horrendous human consequences.","The US is also unusual in the enormous scale of religious fundamentalism. The impact on understanding of the world is extraordinary. In national polls almost half of those surveyed have reported that they believe that God created humans in their present form 10,000 years ago (or less) and that man shares no common ancestor with the ape. There are similar beliefs about the Second Coming.","There is always room for Gramsci\'s \\"optimism of the will.\\"","Anything feasible and potentially effective should be explored.","There is little doubt that a significant part of any serious solution will require advances of technology, but that can only be part of the solution. Other major changes are necessary.","Industrial production of meat makes a huge contribution to global warming.","As for geoengineering, there have been serious general critiques that I think cannot be ignored, like Clive Hamilton\'s, along with many positive assessments. It is not a matter for subjective judgment based on guesswork and intuition. Rather, these are matters that have to be considered seriously, relying on the best scientific understanding available, without abandoning sensible precautionary principles.","If current tendencies persist, the outcome will be disastrous before too long. Large parts of the world will become barely habitable affecting hundreds of millions of people, along with other disasters that we can barely contemplate.","For the last couple of hundred years, there have been struggles about this. Even the Fifth and Sixth Amendments of the constitution talk about personal rights.","A woman was the property of her father or her husband and that remained true right into the twentieth century. It wasn\'t until 1975 that women had a guaranteed right to serve on federal juries.","Like most technology, the internet has mixed effects. It\'s a neutral instrument.","You can go into the Library of Congress and find information on just about anything, but that doesn\'t do you much good unless you know what you are looking for.","If you want to become a biologist, it doesn\'t help to go into the Harvard biology library and all the information is there for you. You have to know what to look for and the internet is the same, just magnified.","We have this huge, massive information, but what is it that matters? What doesn\'t matter? What makes sense, what doesn\'t make sense? You have to have a framework for understanding and of interpretation in order to make use of the information.","Our whole educational and cultural system is not designed to provide those intellectual tools, so people are often lost and the internet often becomes kind of a cult generator.","I am thinking of actual cases of adolescents, lets say, who think they have five hundred friends, because there are five hundred people on their Facebook account. But these are the kind of friends whose relation to you is that if you say \'I bought a sandwich\'; they say \'did it taste good?\' You know, that\'s a kind of interaction, but very different to having a real friend, somebody who you can actually talk to.","I don\'t use the social media but I can see the effects in my own correspondence. I get a ton of correspondence. It used to be hard copy and now it\'s a very limited amount of actual letters people write. So it\'s mostly email.","A lot of the letters that are coming in - a lot of them are queries or comments - are one sentence long... These are from Twitter. And if you look at the nature of those one sentence letters, most of the time it\'s something that came to somebody\'s mind - somebody walking down the street had a thought and sent it out. If they thought about it for two minutes they would not have sent it.","Very commonly I get queries. Somebody saw something of mine on YouTube and of course if there is a talk on YouTube, there aren\'t any footnotes - and they want to know why did you say this. Well if they bothered to look up something in print, they would\'ve seen why I said that. If they ask for evidence, I just say well take a look and mention something they can read and that usually ends the conversation.","I am not offering this is a critique of the internet, its just that there are a lot of factors involved. It does offer plenty of possibilities. It also has, it can have, a cheapening effect and I think both exist and I think its true of everything. You could say that about the printing press.","I happen to agree with the anti-dictatorship policies, but I don\'t think it\'s the role of General Electric to support them or oppose them. They do of course, but I don\'t agree with that.","There are questions as to whether it should even exist. Who should corporations be responsive to, the management of a corporation? Theoretically they are responsive to the shareholders, but I why not to the so - called stakeholders, the work force and the community? Nothing in economic theory opposes that. Those are social and political decisions.","Its true that contemporary technology permits decentralization, it also permits centralization. It depends on how you use the technology.","Contemporary technology could be used to eliminate ownership and management of corporations. It could be used to provide - lets say Apple computers. In principle information technology could be used to provide direct information to the work force on the ground so that they could democratically decide what the company would do, eliminating the role of management. It could be used for that. People aren\'t developing technology for that purpose.","It [the internet] probably has the effect of weakening personal associations.","There is a considerable polarization taking place here, increasing the gap between rich and poor. It\'s most dramatic in Third World countries, of course, but in the rich countries it\'s also very noticeable.","Parts of the United States are taking on a Third World look.","Enormous and growing parts of the population are basically superfluous for profit-making purposes. Along with this, the jail population is increasing very rapidly; it\'s the highest in the industrial world by far. New and onerous crime bills are being passed to deal with this superfluous population.","The capacity to transfer production elsewhere is a weapon against the Western workers.","Workers in different countries can easily be played off against each other.","People have no human rights, only the rights that they can gain on the labour market. Above all, wealth and power have to be protected.","It is reported that about 30% of the world\'s population is unemployed. That\'s worse than the Great Depression, but it\'s now an international phenomenon.","You have 30% of the world unemployed, a huge amount of work, that needs to be done just rebuilding the society alone.","This is class war on an international scale, and power is in the hands of those who control the international economic system.","The Saudi, Arabian ruling class, for example, have rights because they are performing a service for Western power, ensuring that oil profits go to the West and not to the regional population. The local gendarmes like Israel, Turkey and so on have rights, at least in their ruling groups. Others do not.","I agree with Bill Clinton that US forces should not be sent to Haiti, but not for his reasons.","On intervention under the UN framework, I think that sometimes that\'s legitimate, in fact even helpful.","There are many cases around the world in which the presence of UN peace-keeping forces has had a somewhat beneficial effect.","Some of the younger people afford hope for the future. I am not opposed to reform initiatives. For example, if you can build up enough popular support in the United States to put through a reasonable health care program or to support the rights of the working people against the version of NAFTA which was rammed through, these can be good things.","In fact, there is a very close correlation between human rights violations and US aid, particularly in Latin America.","Colombia is potentially a very wealthy country. It has tremendous resources, but its wealth is highly concentrated. Most of the population lives in misery, which has led to violent confrontation throughout the century.","Pakistan is not a unified country. In large parts of the country, the state is regarded as a Punjabi state, not their (the people\'s) state.","Some kind of settlement in Kashmir is crucial for both countries [Pakistan and India]. It\'s also tearing India apart with horrible atrocities in the region which is controlled by Indian armed forces.","A good American friend of mine who has lived in India for many years, working as a journalist, was recently denied entry to the country because he wrote on Kashmir. This is a reflection of fractures within society. Pakistan, too, has to focus on the Lashkar [Lashkar-i-Taiba] and other similar groups and work towards some sort of sensible compromise on Kashmir.","Similar problems are arising in Egypt too. The question is whether the military will release its grip which has been extremely strong for the past 60 years. So this is happening all over the region and particularly strikingly in Pakistan.","The dynamics of the Taliban now appear to be very different and complex, in both Afghanistan and Pakistan, as they attack governments and mainstream parties.","It was right after Woodrow Wilson\'s first serious post-World War I repression, which deported thousands of people, effectively destroyed unions and independent press, and so on. Right after that, the anti-immigration law was passed that remained in place until the 1960s.","The British had an even stronger [then America] business interest in Nazi Germany. And Benito Mussolini was greatly admired.","Every wave of immigrants who came [to America] were treated pretty badly, but when they all finally became integrated, all of us became Anglo-Saxons.","Finally Irish were accepted into society and became part of the political system, and there were Kennedys, and so on. But the same is true about other waves of immigrants, like the Jews in the 1950s.","If you take a look at places like Harvard, it\'s striking. In the early ,50s, I think there were a handful of Jewish professors, three or four. But by the 1960s, there were Jewish deans and administrators. In fact, one of the reasons why MIT became a great university was because they admitted Jews whereas Harvard did not.","Yes, and Syrians. There is a horrible crisis there and the United States has admitted virtually none of the refugees.","The [Barack] Obama administration has pressured Mexico to keep them away from the Mexican border, so that they don\'t succeed in reaching the United States. Pretty much the same thing Europeans have done to Turks and Syrians.","Actually, my first article, it wasn\'t about the anarchists; it was about the fall of Barcelona and the spread of fascism over Europe, which was frightening. But a couple of years later I became interested in the anarchist movement.","[Camillo] Berneri proposed that the anarchists should link up with the effort of Northern Africa to overthrow the Spanish government, carry out land reform, attract the base of the Moorish army, and see if they could undermine [Francisco] Franco\'s army through political warfare in Northern Africa combined with guerrilla warfare in Spain. Historians laughed at that, but I don\'t think they should have. This was the kind of war that might have succeeded in stopping Spanish fascism.","There are very interesting books about these events, for instance one by a very well-known American historian named William R. Polk called Violent Politics. It\'s a record of what are basically guerrilla wars from the American Revolution right up through the wars in Afghanistan and Iraq.","William R. Polk discusses the Spanish guerrilla war against Napoleon [ Bonaparte] and other cases where the conflict turns into a political war, and the invader, who usually has overwhelming power, loses because they can\'t fight the political war.","Real wages for male workers in the United States are about what they were in the \'60s.","There could be an independent labor-based party, which might over time become an important force the way the Labor Party did in England. To all of these things there are plenty of barriers, in the culture and in the social and political institutions, the concentration of economic power. But these are not insuperable barriers, I think. They can be overcome. And it is urgent that this be done, because there are really incredible problems that are simply not being addressed.","The most powerful country in world history, which is sure to set its stamp on what follows, placed the entire government (executive, legislative, judicial branches) in the hands of an organization - the Republican Party - dedicated to escalating the race to disaster.","The labor movement can be rebuilt, as has happened before after sharp declines.","Major efforts have to be undertaken to bring the general public to understand the real reasons for their plight, and the possibilities for radical social and political change to construct meaningful popular control of all institutions - in communities, in the workplace, in the larger society, and on to the international order.","If a person chooses not to be a writer, or speaker, then (by definition) the person is choosing not to be engaged in an effort,\\"to bring the truth about matters of human significance to an audience that can do something about them,\\" apart, perhaps, from some circle of immediate associates.","[Moral responsibilities] has nothing particular to do with academia, except insofar as those within it tend to be unusually privileged in the respects just mentioned.","Fed and electoral college could use some tinkering, but they are not the source of the problems.","When [ Paul Johnson] got to me he was in trouble, because I\'m an old-fashioned conservative: married when I was 21, stayed married, 3 kids, live in the suburbs, no scandals, so nothing to write about. So what he did is concoct one of the nuttiest claims I\'ve ever seen.","The reason I am a political radical is that I work on syntax. If I worked on semantics (which in fact I do), I\'d be a good Thatcherite.","I\'ve been interested in the reports on Rojava. It seems clear that there are positive developments.","We should certainly not be perpetuating further harm to others or to the environment. Suppose that workers at ExxonMobil are trying to unionize. We have two choices: to help them improve their lives, or to keep away so that their lives will be worse. Neither choice has any effect on use of fossil fuels. So radical organizers can both help them unionize and improve their lives, and convince them to find a different way to survive and work for ending the use of fossil fuels.","Radical activists can\'t ignore the fact that we live in this world, like it or not, and have to make difficult decisions about which paths are the best - or sometimes, the least harmful. There are no abstract formulas. Have to think through each case on its own.","Because the 1979 strike against U.S. Steel in Youngstown, Ohio was an occupation - and actually, that\'s a model that really should be pursued now.They went on from striking to trying to have the workforce and the communities take over the abandoned factories that U.S. Steel was dismantling.","I mean the reason the sit-down strikes struck such fear in the hearts of management was that they knew that a sit-down strike was just one step short of taking over the factory.","The U.S. is different from Europe and other industrial countries.","The U.S. is, to a very unusual extent, a business-run society.","U.S. has no feudal background, so institutions that remained in place in Europe did not remain in place here.","The fact of the matter is that the U.S. is run by an unusually class-conscious, dedicated business class that has a very violent labor history, much worse than in Europe.","The attack on unions has been far more extreme here [in U.S], and it has been much more successful.","I\'ll have 15 letters today from mostly young kids who don\'t like what\'s going on and want to do something about it, and [they ask me] if I can give them some advice as to what they should do, or can I tell them what to read or something.","Everything depends very much on who you are, what your values are, what your commitments are, what circumstances you live in and what options you\'re willing to undertake, and that determines what you ought to be doing.","There are some very general ideas that people can keep in mind; they\'re kind of truisms. It\'s only worth mentioning them because they\'re always denied.","If [Barack] Obama or the boss or the newspapers or anyone else tells you they\'re doing this, that, or the other thing, dismiss it or assume the opposite is true, which it often is.","They [the union] were members of the Communist Party - they didn\'t care one way or another about Russia, they just cared about the United States.","You\'ve just got to get people organized and tell them the truth. There aren\'t any magic tricks to it. You know, sometimes it\'s pretty amazing. Actually, I mentioned a pretty striking case of this in \\"Crisis and Hope,\\" which was the Caterpillar case in the early 1990s.","The community itself didn\'t support the union. Now that\'s kind of interesting about [Barack] Obama, because Obama was supposedly a community organizer in Chicago at that time. Now I\'m sure he read the Chicago Tribune, so he knew about it, but when he went to show his solidarity with the workforce, the first place he went was Caterpillar. I don\'t think he\'s forgotten, and the labor movement didn\'t react. Even radical labor historians didn\'t remember. It was only 15 years ago, after all, but that\'s a real triumph of propaganda in many ways.","The [Ronald] Reagan administration told the business world that they were not going to enforce the labor laws.","The number of illegal firings tripled during the [Ronald] Reagan years. It was at that time that you started getting these companies that specialized in how to destroy unions.","The contradiction is somehow unresolved. In the case of the business propaganda, it\'s particularly ironic because while business wants the population to hate the government, they want the population to love the government. Namely, they\'re in favor of a very powerful state which works in their interest.","Marx\'s early manuscripts, with their roots in the Enlightenment and Romanticism, derived fundamental concepts such as alienation from a conception of human nature - what we would call genetically determined.","Like other organisms, humans have a certain genetic endowment (apparently varying little in the species, not a surprise considering its recent separation from other hominids). That determines what we call their nature.","Anatomically modern humans are found up to 200,000 years ago; behaviourally modern humans appear very recently in evolutionary time, as far as evidence now exists, perhaps within a window of 50-100,000 years ago, a flick of an eye in evolutionary time.","If the rewiring of the brain that yielded recursive generation of hierarchically structured expressions took place in an individual, not a group (and there seems to be no coherent alternative), then interaction must have been a later phenomenon.","Language would have evolved first as an internal object, a kind of \\"language of thought\\" (LOT), with externalisation (hence communication) an ancillary process. I can\'t review here the strong and growing evidence to support this conclusion, but I have elsewhere. There are ample reasons why having a LOT would confer selectional advantage: the person so endowed could plan, interpret, reflect, etc., in ways denied to others.","As for organs, traits, etc., being \\"for\\" something, the notion may be a useful shorthand, but shouldn\'t be taken too seriously, if only because of the ubiquitous phenomenon of exaptation.","Selfish-gene theory tells us nothing about the value of interacting through language.","Anton Pannekoek didn\'t encourage radical workers and other activists of the anti-Bolshevik left to see revolutionary potential in his work in astronomy, for the simple reason that he was honest, and knew there was none to speak of.","Academics are not necessarily nice people.","The reason academic disputes are so vicious is that so little is at stake.","There certainly are those who worship the state much as divinities are worshipped. Not just the state but even leaders.","In general I don\'t think the image of the state as a divinity is very helpful.","While the state can coerce, with some exceptions (like North Korea) it seems to me misleading to think of it as capable of \\"enslavement.\\"","Democracy has both expanded and declined over the years.","One of the dangers [that Donald Trump poses, due to the augmented risk of nuclear war] is unquestionable. Of the two existential threats - the threats to the termination of the species basically and most other species - one of them, climate change, on that I think there\'s no basis for discussion.","[Donald] Trump has been very inconsistent on many things; on Twitter he\'s been all over the place, but some of it is very consistent. That is: Do nothing about climate change except make it worse. And he\'s not just speaking for himself, but for the whole Republican Party, the whole leadership. It\'s already had impact, it will have worse impact.","On the other hand, you have to balance that against expanding our nuclear forces, add to our so-called depleted military, which is already more powerful than the rest of the world combined; attack in Syria, send forces to Syria, start bombing. Who knows what could be next?","That\'s a large part of the source of the gun culture. You have to have a gun when you go into Starbucks, because who knows what\'s going to happen. It just doesn\'t happen in other countries.","If you look back to the anti-intervention movements, what were they? Let\'s take the Vietnam War - the biggest crime since the Second World War. You couldn\'t be opposed to the war for years. The mainstream liberal intellectuals were enthusiastically in support of the war. In Boston, a liberal city where I was, we literally couldn\'t have a public demonstration without it being violently broken up, with the liberal press applauding, until late 1966.","The leading, the most respected Vietnam historian, military historian Bernard Fall -he was a hawk incidentally, but he cared for the Vietnamese - he said it wasn\'t clear to him whether Vietnam could survive as a historical and cultural entity under the most massive attack that any region that size had ever suffered. He was talking about South Vietnam, incidentally.","There is undoubtedly much to learn about the social uses of language, for communication or for other purposes. But at present there is not much in the way of a theory of sociolinguistics, of social uses of languages, as far as I am aware.","I think that we have basically nothing in the field of human behavior. Maybe that is just a condition of temporary ignorance. But it may be that we are simply not intellectually equipped to develop such a theory.","If humans are organisms like every other organism - which they are - then we should expect that if there are some domains where real scientific progress is possible, then there are others where it is not.","The rise of what\'s called Islamic fundamentalism is to a significant extent a result of the collapse of secular nationalist alternatives which were either discredited internally or destroyed, leaving few other options. Something like that may be true of American society.","Every book that comes out, every article that comes out, talks about how - while it may have been a \\"mistake\\" or an \\"unwise effort\\" - the United States was defending South Vietnam from North Vietnamese aggression. And they portray those who opposed the war as apologists for North Vietnam. That\'s standard to say. The purpose is obvious: to obscure the fact that the United States did attack South Vietnam and the major war was fought against South Vietnam.","Resource extraction impacts a global environment that is increasingly at severe risk.","The criminalization of Black life was something specific to the United States in the post-Reconstruction period and there\'s something like it happening today with mass incarceration, directed largely against black males.","The racism in Europe takes the form of anti-immigrant extremism - which is bad enough here - I think it\'s hard to measure, but my guess is that it\'s probably worse there.","In the West, you don\'t get in any trouble if you tell the truth, but you still can\'t do it. Not only can\'t you tell the truth, you can\'t think the truth. It\'s just so deeply embedded, deeply instilled, that without any meaningful coercion it comes out the same way it does in a totalitarian state.","It\'s very hard to look in the mirror. We all know this. It\'s much easier to have illusions about yourself. And in particular, when you think, well, I\'m going to believe what I like, but I\'ll say what the powerful want, you do that over time, and you believe what you say.","Somehow the fact of enormous privilege and freedom carries with it a sense of impotence, which is a strange, but striking, phenomenon. The fact is, we can do just about anything. There is no difficulty, wherever you are, in finding groups that are working hard on things that concern you.","The public is easily amenable to lies: the more lies there are, the greater the support for war. For instance, when the public was told that Saddam Hussein would attack the U.S., this increased support for the war.","I don\'t think that any deal was needed: Iran was not a threat. Even if Iran were a threat, there was a very easy way to handle it - by establishing a Middle East Nuclear Weapons Free Zone, which is something that nearly everyone in the world wants.","If North Korea doesn\'t have a deterrent, they will be wiped out.","I don\'t think that the United States cares. They just assume that North Korea will soon have nuclear weapons.","Terror became a big issue when the Reagan Administration came in. They immediately announced [their plans] and kind of disparaged Carter\'s alleged human rights programs. The main issue is state-directed international terrorism. Right at that time that big industry developed. That\'s when you start getting the academic departments on terrorism.","The worst terrorist crimes going on right now are the drone campaigns.","Take a look at the Supreme Court decision that just authorized an effort by U.S. claimants against Iran for terrorist acts. What are the terrorist acts? The terrorist acts are bombings of U.S. military installations in Lebanon and Saudi Arabia, which Iran is claimed to have something to do with. Well suppose they did. That\'s not terrorism. I mean if we have a military base in Lebanon that while we\'re shelling Lebanese naval ships, the Navy is shelling Lebanese installations and somebody attacks [that\'s not terrorism].","In fact if you look at Reagan\'s global war on terrorism it very quickly turned into a massive terrorist war: [by us] Central America, South Africa, the Middle East, all U.S.-backed terrorism. That\'s one of the reasons why it disappeared from history and why the standard line is that Bush 43 declared the war on terror. Actually he just repeated what Reagan had said 20 years earlier.","Around 2008 and again in 2013 NATO officially offered the Ukraine the opportunity to join NATO. That\'s something no Russian government is ever going to accept. It\'s right at the geopolitical heartland of Russia.","They, students have a degree of freedom that nobody else has.","Look, the United States doesn\'t have political parties. In other countries, take say Europe, you can be an active member of the political party. Here, the only thing in a political party is gearing to elections, not the other things you do. So it\'s basically, a way of making people passive, submissive objects.","You ought to teach kids that elections take place but that\'s not politics. If you want to know how legislation is made it doesn\'t come from elections.","Silicon Valley wouldn\'t exist without massive government spending and in fact initiative.","Silicon Valley benefits, as all of industry, from highly protectionist policy - patent policies and things like that - which come out of the government.","We should not want to permit providers, for example to have control over access.","Take Google - I can use it, you can use it, anyone else can use it, but we all know its designed so that private power can influence significantly how you access it.","So the first things that you see when you look up something on Google could be dependent on the amount of advertising or something else. Since it is a profit making institution, it is going to reflect the interests and concerns of those who fund it, which is advertisers.","You know, you can go to the fiftieth thing on a Google list and that\'s the one you want, but the ones you are going to be directed to are the funders.","In a society that has very high concentration of capital in a narrow sector of the population, that\'s going to influence everything in different ways.","Personally, I am uneasy about the notion of \\"a politically engaged university,\\" for reasons I wrote about over 30 years ago, at the height of protest and resistance (reprinted in For Reasons of State).","All you have to do is read the business literature. In the 1930s they were very frightened and they were concerned about how the rising power of the masses was hazardous to industrialists.","[For business after WWII ] democracy means getting people to regard government as an alien force that\'s robbing them and oppressing them, not as their government. In a democracy it would be your government.","We have to be irrational and vindictive, because that\'s going to frighten people. And we have to maintain this for years. And then we\'ll be able to carry out the actions that we want to carry out.","I think that the real tragedy of Greece - aside of the savagery of European bureaucracy, Brussels bureaucracy and northern banks, which was really savage - is that the Greek crisis didn\'t have to erupt. It could have been taken care of pretty easily at the very beginning. But it happened and Syriza came into office with a declared commitment to combat it, and in fact as I recall they actually called a referendum, which horrified Europe.","We have to remember that literally within months after Castro\'s taking office the planes from Florida were beginning to bomb Cuba. Within a year, the Eisenhower administration secretly, but formally, decided to overthrow the government. Then came the Bay of Pigs invasion. The Kennedy administration was furious about the failure of the invasion and immediately launched a major terrorist war and economic war that got harsher through the years. Under these conditions it is kind of amazing that Cuba survived.","I don\'t really think there have been transitional periods to socialism. There have been efforts, but they have usually been destroyed by a combination of external force and internal corruption.","What was the invasion of South Vietnam, for example, in 1962, when Kennedy sent the Air Force to bomb South Vietnam and start chemical warfare? That\'s aggression.","The invasion of Panama, what was that? The U.S. killed, according to the Panamanians, 3,000 civilians. Maybe they\'re right. We don\'t investigate our own crimes, so nobody knows.","When something like this [2003 invasion of Iraq] takes place, the international law professionals have a complicated task. There is a fringe that just tells the truth: Look, it\'s a violation of international law. But most have to construct complex arguments to justify it as defense counsel. That\'s basically their job, defense counsel for state power.","A good education instills in you the intuitive comprehension - it becomes unconscious and reflexive - that you just don\'t think certain things, things that are threatening to power interests.","Every night I get many letters, and after every talk I get many questions from people who say, \\"I want to change things. What can I do?\\" I never hear these questions from peasants in southern Colombia or Kurds in southeastern Turkey under miserable repression or anybody who is suffering. They don\'t ask what they can do; they tell you what they\'re doing.","It\'s true that language is in a sense linear but that is as obvious as perceptual space is three-dimensional.","For us, we are all very different, our languages are very different, and our societies are very different. But if we could extract ourselves from our point of view and sort of look down at human life the way a biologist looks at other organisms, I think we could see it a different way.","There are huge areas where the human mind is apparently incapable of forming sciences, or at least has not done so. There are other areas - so far, in fact, one area only [physics] - in which we have demonstrated the capacity for true scientific progress.","While I think in principle people should not have irrational beliefs, I should say that as a matter of fact, it is people who hold what I regard as completely irrational beliefs who are among the most effective moral actors in the world, in many respects. They\'re among the worst, but also among the best, even though the moral beliefs are ostensibly the same.","The real invasion of South Vietnam which was directed largely against the rural society began directly in 1962 after many years of working through mercenaries and client groups. And that fact simply does not exist in official American history. There is no such event in American history as the attack on South Vietnam. That\'s gone. Of course, It is a part of real history. But it\'s not a part of official history.","Most of us who were opposed to the war, especially in the early \'60\'s - the war we were opposed to was the war on South Vietnam which destroyed South Vietnam\'s rural society. The South was devastated. But now anyone who opposed this atrocity is regarded as having defended North Vietnam. And that\'s part of the effort to present the war as if it were a war between South Vietnam and North Vietnam with the United States helping the South. Of course it\'s fabrication. But it\'s \\"official truth\\" now.","China is the center of the Asian energy security grid, which includes the Central Asian states and Russia. India is also hovering around the edge, South Korea is involved, and Iran is an associate member of some kind. If the Middle East oil resources around the Gulf, which are the main ones in the world, if they link up to the Asian grid, the United States is really a second-rate power. A lot is at stake in not withdrawing from Iraq.","I happened to go to a school when I was a kid and that\'s all we did, pursue our own interests. It was kind of structured so you ended up knowing everything you were supposed to know, arithmetic, Latin, whatever it was. But almost always it was under your own initiative.","Technologies can be liberating, but it can also be a tool of coercion and control.","Let\'s take Southeast Asia. The last 20, 30 years has been what\'s called the \\"Asian Miracle\\" - fast economic growth, industrial society. It\'s happening all over, with one exception, which one? The Philippines is the one that can\'t grow, which the US has been running for 100 years. Is there a correlation? Have you read about it? It comes to mind, at least.","It makes sense for societies to make education compulsory for children. Children are vulnerable. They can\'t make decisions. But the decisions can\'t all be left in the hands of the parents. They can be irresponsible too.","California is maybe the richest place in the world. They\'re destroying the best public education system in the world.","I think there was an overemphasis in the early stage on militarization rather than directly providing relief. I don\'t think it has any long-term significance.","United States has comparative advantage in military force. It tends to react to anything at first with military force, that\'s what it\'s good at. And I think they overdid it. There was more military force than was necessary.","I think it\'s just been a core part of the Cuban revolution to have a very high level of internationalism. I mean, these cases you\'ve mentioned are cases in point, but the most extreme case was the liberation of Africa. Take the case of Angola for example, and there are real connections between Cuba and Angola-much of the Cuban population comes from Angola.","The lessons are, unfortunately, that a small weak country that is facing an extremely hostile and very violent superpower will not make much progress unless there\'s a strong solidarity movement within the superpower that will restrain its actions. With more support within the United States, I think the Haitian efforts could have succeeded.","I think individuals have a right to privacy, but that ought to include the right to prevent private institutions from monitoring what you do and building up a personal profile for you so that they can direct you in particular ways by their effective control over the internet, and that doesn\'t happen of course.","Private companies can make a personal profile, direct you to things - they will say - that you would be interested in, but that\'s their choice not your choice.","I think that has a lot of dangers, as does government surveillance, which is way too high.","I think there are all kinds of intrusions into private rights that make use of contemporary technology.","It is an astonishing fact about the current era that in the most powerful country in world history, with a high level of education and privilege, one of the two political parties virtually denies the well-established facts about anthropogenic climate change.","Blacks have no rights - in fact they were three - fifths human according to the constitution to give slave owners more voting rights. So that\'s African Americans.","Somebody puts up some weird thing and somebody else thinks yeah maybe that\'s the way things work and pretty soon you have some cult going. Its not the fault of the internet, it\'s the fault of a social and culture system that doesn\'t educate people properly and in fact on purpose. They don\'t want to educate people properly.","Just take ease of interchange between people. Your email is of course faster than letter - on the other hand the transition from sailing ship to telegraphs was far greater than the shift from the postal service to email. That was a fabulous change. If you sent a letter to England, instead of waiting a couple of months for a response you got it instantly. That\'s a huge change. Every one of these changes of course increases opportunities and also increases means of control and domination.","[Internet] is kind of like a hammer. The technology itself doesn\'t determine how its used. It depends on the social, cultural and economic context in which the technology is made available.","My own feeling is that a corporation has no right to have a political or social influence.","They are involve in producing products and there are different kinds of people running them, but the principle is the same. A corporation shouldn\'t have the right. Under American law as its developed over the past century, corporation do have personal rights, but I think that\'s a very negative development.","The main selling appeal of NAFTA to US corporations is that it gives them an advantage in the North American market over their European and Japanese competitors.","NAFTA and GATT are quite similar. They both have highly protectionist elements. They\'re kind of a mixture of liberalization and protection designed to expand the power of transnational corporations. They\'re very basically investor\'s rights agreements. One crucial part in both is the \\"intellectual property right,\\" which is a funny way of saying that corporations, like pharmaceutical companies, will have near-monopolistic rule over future technology.

This is all hailed as a great success, and it is a great success - for a very small sector of the population.","The United States is alone among all the countries in that it does not permit US military forces to be under any threat. Other countries are willing to have forces in peace-keeping operations where they sometimes are under threat, but the US is not willing to do that.","As far as DSA is concerned, I\'m perfectly happy to be associated with it while disagreeing with a large part of the leadership.","When you read about the end of the Soviet Union, it\'s always about the \\"death of socialism.\\" They never say \\"the death of democracy.\\" But it makes about the same sense.","Sectors of power are not going to favor the flourishing of dissidence.","We don\'t live in tyrannies, you know, the king doesn\'t decide what\'s legitimate, and there\'s much more freedom than there was in the past.","In fact, Clinton-era publications of the US Space Command describe control over space as a parallel to control over the oceans a century ago. Then, countries built navies to protect and enhance their power in commercial and strategic interests.

They still have the option of bombing if they want to. And incidentally, to add one comment about this, you\'ll notice that this would be a very good moment to institute a call for imposing the Chemical Weapons Convention on the Middle East.","Technology can be used that way and it can also be used in other ways.","One can neither agree nor disagree with a terminological proposal, as long as it is clear that it is just that: terminological.","As to whether those who fit the common meaning of the term \\"intellectual\\" should act in the manner that [ Edward] Said prescribes, that\'s another question. Needless to say, I agree with him that they should, and that they commonly do not.","Academics are mostly professionals, involved in their work and other concerns of their own, with no particular interest in the workings of the ideological system.","[Mikhail Bakunin] expectations were generally confirmed, including his prediction that some would seek to gain state power on the backs of popular revolution, then constructing a \\"Red bureaucracy\\" that would be one of the worst tyrannies in history, while others would recognize that power lies elsewhere and would serve as its apologists, becoming mystifies, \\"disablers,\\" and managers while demanding the right to function in \\"technocratic isolation,\\" in World Bank lingo.","I would, however, question the implication that there is some novelty in this beyond modalities [of Mikhail Bakunin], which naturally change as institutions change and develop.","I organized tax resistance in 1965, with a friend. I kept at it for about ten years. I don\'t see it as a principle, it\'s a tactic. And I felt I had exhausted its potential as a tactic right about then, so I stopped.","I just went along with political activists and interested in other intellectual interests which I pursued kind of at random. I never had a real college education. I got a degree, but it was just patching together courses here and there.","Over the years, there\'s been case after case when there were very narrow decisions that had to be made about whether to launch nuclear weapons in serious cases. What is this guy [Donald Trump] going to do if his vaunted negotiating skills fail, if somebody doesn\'t do what he says? Is he going to say, \\"Okay we\'ll nuke them?

Instead of citizens, it produces consumers. Instead of communities, it produces shopping malls. The net result is an atomized society of disengaged individuals who feel demoralized and socially powerless.In sum, neoliberalism is the immediate and foremost enemy of genuine participatory democracy, not just in the United States but across the planet, and will be for the foreseeable future.","How people themselves perceive what they are doing is not a question that interests me. I mean, there are very few people who are going to look into the mirror and say, \'That person I see is a savage monster\'; instead, they make up some construction that justifies what they do. If you ask the CEO of some major corporation what he does he will say, in all honesty, that he is slaving 20 hours a day to provide his customers with the best goods or services he can and creating the best possible working conditions for his employees. But then you take a look at what the corporation does, the effect of its legal structure, the vast inequalities in pay and conditions, and you see the reality is something far different.","...the Bible is probably the most genocidal book in the literary canon.","Responsibility I believe accrues through privilege. People like you and me have an unbelievable amount of privilege and therefore we have a huge amount of responsibility. We live in free societies where we are not afraid of the police; we have extraordinary wealth available to us by global standards. If you have those things, then you have the kind of responsibility that a person does not have if he or she is slaving seventy hours a week to put food on the table; a responsibility at the very least to inform yourself about power.

As far as I know, and this is only from personal experience in teaching, I think about ninety percent of the problem in teaching, or maybe ninety-eight percent, is just to help the students get interested. Or what it usually amounts to is to not prevent them from being interested. Typically they come in interested, and the process of education is a way of driving that defect out of their minds. But if children[\'s] ... normal interest is maintained or even aroused, they can do all kinds of things in ways we don\'t understand.","The smart way to keep people passive and obedient is to strictly limit the spectrum of acceptable opinion, but allow very lively debate within that spectrum \u2014 even encourage the more critical and dissident views. That gives people the sense that there\'s free thinking going on, while all the time the presuppositions of the system are being reinforced by the limits put on the range of the debate.","Modern industrial civilization has developed within a certain system of convenient myths. The driving force of modern industrial civilization has been individual material gain, which is accepted as legitimate, even praiseworthy, on the grounds that private vices yield public benefits in the classic formulation.Now, it\'s long been understood very well that a society that is based on this principle will destroy itself in time. It can only persist with whatever suffering and injustice it entails as long as it\'s possible to pretend that the destructive forces that humans create are limited: that the world is an infinite resource, and that the world is an infinite garbage-can. At this stage of history, either one of two things is possible: either the general population will take control of its own destiny and will concern itself with community-interests, guided by values of solidarity and sympathy and concern for others; or, alternatively, there will be no destiny for anyone to control.As long as some specialized class is in a position of authority, it is going to set policy in the special interests that it serves. But the conditions of survival, let alone justice, require rational social planning in the interests of the community as a whole and, by now, that means the global community. The question is whether privileged elites should dominate mass-communication, and should use this power as they tell us they must, namely, to impose necessary illusions, manipulate and deceive the stupid majority, and remove them from the public arena. The question, in brief, is whether democracy and freedom are values to be preserved or threats to be avoided. In this possibly terminal phase of human existence, democracy and freedom are more than values to be treasured, they may well be essential to survival.","If you quietly accept and go along no matter what your feelings are, ultimately you internalize what you\'re saying, because it\'s too hard to believe one thing and say another. I can see it very strikingly in my own background. Go to any elite university and you are usually speaking to very disciplined people, people who have been selected for obedience. And that makes sense. If you\'ve resisted the temptation to tell the teacher, \\"You\'re an asshole,\\" which maybe he or she is, and if you don\'t say, \\"That\'s idiotic,\\" when you get a stupid assignment, you will gradually pass through the required filters. You will end up at a good college and eventually with a good job.","In my own professional work I have touched on a variety of different fields. I\u2019ve done work in mathematical linguistics, for example, without any professional credentials in mathematics; in this subject I am completely self-taught, and not very well taught. But I\u2019ve often been invited by universities to speak on mathematical linguistics at mathematics seminars and colloquia. No one has ever asked me whether I have the appropriate credentials to speak on these subjects; the mathematicians couldn\u2019t care less. What they want to know is what I have to say. No one has ever objected to my right to speak, asking whether I have a doctor\u2019s degree in mathematics, or whether I have taken advanced courses in the subject. That would never have entered their minds. They want to know whether I am right or wrong, whether the subject is interesting or not, whether better approaches are possible\u2026 the discussion dealt with the subject, not with my right to discuss it. But on the other hand, in discussion or debate concerning social issues or American foreign policy\u2026. The issue is constantly raised, often with considerable venom. I\u2019ve repeatedly been challenged on grounds of credentials, or asked, what special training do I have that entitles you to speak on these matters. The assumption is that people like me, who are outsiders from a professional viewpoint, are not entitled to speak on such things. Compare mathematics and the political sciences\u2026 it\u2019s quite striking. In mathematics, in physics, people are concerned with what you say, not with your certification. But in order to speak about social reality, you must have the proper credentials, particularly if you depart from the accepted framework of thinking. Generally speaking, it seems fair to say that the richer the intellectual substance of a field, the less there is a concern for credentials, and the greater is the concern for content.","No honest journalist should be willing to describe himself or herself as \'embedded.\' To say, \'I\'m an embedded journalist\' is to say, \'I\'m a government Propagandist.","The kind of work that should be the main part of life is the kind of work you would want to do if you weren\'t being paid for it.

The God of the Bible - not only did He order His chosen people to carry out literal genocide - I mean, wipe out every Amalekite to the last man, woman, child, and, you know, donkey and so on, because hundreds of years ago they got in your way when you were trying to cross the desert - not only did He do things like that, but, after all, the God of the Bible was ready to destroy every living creature on earth because some humans irritated Him. That\'s the story of Noah. I mean, that\'s beyond genocide - you don\'t know how to describe this creature. Somebody offended Him, and He was going to destroy every living being on earth? And then He was talked into allowing two of each species to stay alive - that\'s supposed to be gentle and wonderful.","The two main criminals are France and the United States. They owe Haiti enormous reparations because of actions going back hundreds of years. If we could ever get to the stage where somebody could say, \'We\'re sorry we did it,\' that would be nice. But if that just assuages guilt, it\'s just another crime. To become minimally civilized, we would have to say, \'We carried out and benefited from vicious crimes. A large part of the wealth of France comes from the crimes we committed against Haiti, and the United States gained as well. Therefore we are going to pay reparations to the Haitian people.\' Then you will see the beginnings of civilization.","Israel\'s demonstration of its military prowess in 1967 confirmed its status as a \'strategic asset,\' as did its moves to prevent Syrian intervention in Jordan in 1970 in support of the PLO. Under the Nixon doctrine, Israel and Iran were to be \'the guardians of the Gulf,\' and after the fall of the Shah, Israel\'s perceived role was enhanced. Meanwhile, Israel has provided subsidiary services elsewhere, including Latin America, where direct US support for the most murderous regimes has been impeded by Congress. While there has been internal debate and some fluctuation in US policy, much exaggerated in discussion here, it has been generally true that US support for Israel\'s militarization and expansion reflected the estimate of its power in the region.The effect has been to turn Israel into a militarized state completely dependent on US aid, willing to undertake tasks that few can endure, such as participation in Guatemalan genocide. For Israel, this is a moral disaster and will eventually become a physical disaster as well. For the Palestinians and many others, it has been a catastrophe, as it may sooner or later be for the entire world, with the growing danger of superpower confrontation.","This Sarah Palin phenomenon is very curious.

In such circumstances you\'ve got to divert the bewildered herd, because if they start noticing this they may not like it, since they\'re the ones suffering from it.

For example the views expressed by the founder of the modern higher education system, Wilhelm von Humboldt, leading humanist, a figure of the enlightenment who wrote extensively on education and human development and argued, I think, kind of very plausibly, that the core principle and requirement of a fulfilled human being is the ability to inquire and create constructively independently without external controls. To move to a modern counterpart, a leading physicist who talked right here [at MIT], used to tell his classes it\'s not important what we cover in the class, it\'s important what you discover. To be truly educated from this point of view means to be in a position to inquire and to create on the basis of the resources available to you which you\'ve come to appreciate and comprehend. To know where to look, to know how to formulate serious questions, to question a standard doctrine if that\'s appropriate, to find your own way, to shape the questions that are worth pursuing, and to develop the path to pursue them. That means knowing, understanding many things but also, much more important than what you have stored in your mind, to know where to look, how to look, how to question, how to challenge, how to proceed independently, to deal with the challenges that the world presents to you and that you develop in the course of your self education and inquiry and investigations, in cooperation and solidarity with others. That\'s what an educational system should cultivate from kindergarten to graduate school, and in the best cases sometimes does, and that leads to people who are, at least by my standards, well educated.","Over the last 25 years, the major popular movements that have had significant impact on the general society and have changed it, that have had a major civilizing effect \u2013 the feminist movement, the environmental movement, and so on \u2013 these are mostly developments of the \u201870s and \u201880s. Their roots might be in the activism of the \u201860s, but the movements themselves developed and extended later. The same is true of the changes in respect for other cultures, rights of oppressed people, and so on. These are quite significant changes. If you compare the United States now to what it was, say, 35 years ago, the changes are quite dramatic. These are changes in popular consciousness that are quite deeply embedded.","To begin with, we have to be more clear about what we mean by patriotic feelings. For a time when I was in high school, I cheered for the school athletic teams. That\'s a form of patriotism \u2014 group loyalty. It can take pernicious forms, but in itself it can be quite harmless, maybe even positive. At the national level, what \\"patriotism\\" means depends on how we view the society. Those with deep totalitarian commitments identify the state with the society, its people, and its culture. Therefore those who criticized the policies of the Kremlin under Stalin were condemned as \\"anti-Soviet\\" or \\"hating Russia\\". For their counterparts in the West, those who criticize the policies of the US government are \\"anti-American\\" and \\"hate America\\"; those are the standard terms used by intellectual opinion, including left-liberal segments, so deeply committed to their totalitarian instincts that they cannot even recognize them, let alone understand their disgraceful history, tracing to the origins of recorded history in interesting ways. For the totalitarian, \\"patriotism\\" means support for the state and its policies, perhaps with twitters of protest on grounds that they might fail or cost us too much. For those whose instincts are democratic rather than totalitarian, \\"patriotism\\" means commitment to the welfare and improvement of the society, its people, its culture. That\'s a natural sentiment and one that can be quite positive. It\'s one all serious activists share, I presume; otherwise why take the trouble to do what we do? But the kind of \\"patriotism\\" fostered by totalitarian societies and military dictatorships, and internalized as second nature by much of intellectual opinion in more free societies, is one of the worst maladies of human history, and will probably do us all in before too long.With regard to the US, I think we find a mix. Every effort is made by power and doctrinal systems to stir up the more dangerous and destructive forms of \\"patriotism\\"; every effort is made by people committed to peace and justice to organize and encourage the beneficial kinds. It\'s a constant struggle. When people are frightened, the more dangerous kinds tend to emerge, and people huddle under the wings of power. Whatever the reasons may be, by comparative standards the US has been a very frightened country for a long time, on many dimensions. Quite commonly in history, such fears have been fanned by unscrupulous leaders, seeking to implement their own agendas. These are commonly harmful to the general population, which has to be disciplined in some manner: the classic device is to stimulate fear of awesome enemies concocted for the purpose, usually with some shreds of realism, required even for the most vulgar forms of propaganda. Germany was the pride of Western civilization 70 years ago, but most Germans were whipped to presumably genuine fear of the Czech dagger pointed at the heart of Germany (is that crazier than the Nicaraguan or Grenadan dagger pointed at the heart of the US, conjured up by the people now playing the same game today?), the Jewish-Bolshevik conspiracy aimed at destroying the Aryan race and the civilization that Germany had inherited from Greece, etc.That\'s only the beginning. A lot is at stake.","[Israel\'s military occupation is] in gross violation of international law and has been from the outset. And that much, at least, is fully recognized, even by the United States, which has overwhelming and, as I said, unilateral responsibility for these crimes. So George Bush No. 1, when he was the U.N. ambassador, back in 1971, he officially reiterated Washington\'s condemnation of Israel\'s actions in the occupied territories. He happened to be referring specifically to occupied Jerusalem. In his words, actions in violation of the provisions of international law governing the obligations of an occupying power, namely Israel. He criticized Israel\'s failure \\"to acknowledge its obligations under the Fourth Geneva Convention as well as its actions which are contrary to the letter and spirit of this Convention.\\" [...] However, by that time, late 1971, a divergence was developing, between official policy and practice. The fact of the matter is that by then, by late 1971, the United States was already providing the means to implement the violations that Ambassador Bush deplored. [...] on December 5th [2001], there had been an important international conference, called in Switzerland, on the 4th Geneva Convention. Switzerland is the state that\'s responsible for monitoring and controlling the implementation of them. The European Union all attended, even Britain, which is virtually a U.S. attack dog these days. They attended. A hundred and fourteen countries all together, the parties to the Geneva Convention. They had an official declaration, which condemned the settlements in the occupied territories as illegal, urged Israel to end its breaches of the Geneva Convention, some \\"grave breaches,\\" including willful killing, torture, unlawful deportation, unlawful depriving of the rights of fair and regular trial, extensive destruction and appropriation of property not justified by military necessity and carried out unlawfully and wantonly. Grave breaches of the Geneva Convention, that\'s a serious term, that means serious war crimes. The United States is one of the high contracting parties to the Geneva Convention, therefore it is obligated, by its domestic law and highest commitments, to prosecute the perpetrators of grave breaches of the conventions. That includes its own leaders. Until the United States prosecutes its own leaders, it is guilty of grave breaches of the Geneva Convention, that means war crimes. And it\'s worth remembering the context. It is not any old convention. These are the conventions established to criminalize the practices of the Nazis, right after the Second World War. What was the U.S. reaction to the meeting in Geneva? The U.S. boycotted the meeting [..] and that has the usual consequence, it means the meeting is null and void, silence in the media.","\u0627\u0644\u062f\u0639\u0627\u064a\u0629 \u0641\u064a \u0627\u0644\u0646\u0638\u0627\u0645 \u0627\u0644\u062f\u064a\u0645\u0642\u0631\u0627\u0637\u064a \u0647\u064a \u0628\u0645\u062b\u0627\u0628\u0629 \u0627\u0644\u0647\u0631\u0627\u0648\u0627\u062a \u0641\u064a \u0627\u0644\u062f\u0648\u0644\u0629 \u0627\u0644\u0634\u0645\u0648\u0644\u064a\u0629","Historical amnesia is a dangerous phenomenon not only because it undermines moral and intellectual integrity but also because it lays the groundwork for crimes that still lie ahead.","Both political parties have moved to the right during the neoliberal period.

We all want to give more than to receive. We all want to live in a world where solidarity and companionship are more important values than individualism and selfishness. We all want to share beautiful things; experience joy, laughter, love; and experiment, together.","My guess is that you would find that the intellectual elite is the most heavily indoctrinated sector [of society], for good reasons. It\'s their role as a secular priesthood to really believe the nonsense that they put forth. Other people can repeat it, but it\'s not that crucial that they really believe it. But for the intellectual elite themselves, it\'s crucial that they believe it because, after all, they are the guardians of the faith. Except for a very rare person who\'s an outright liar, it\'s hard to be a convincing exponent of the faith unless you\'ve internalized it and come to believe it.","My own concern is primarily the terror and violence carried out by my own state, for two reasons. For one thing, because it happens to be the larger component of international violence. But also for a much more important reason than that; namely, I can do something about it. So even if the U.S. was responsible for 2 percent of the violence in the world instead of the majority of it, it would be that 2 percent I would be primarily responsible for. And that is a simple ethical judgment. That is, the ethical value of one\'s actions depends on their anticipated and predictable consequences. It is very easy to denounce the atrocities of someone else. That has about as much ethical value as denouncing atrocities that took place in the 18th century.","As in the past, the costs and risks of the coming phases of the industrial economy were to be socialized, with eventual profits privatized ...","Earlier in the twentieth century some critics called fascism \u201ccapitalism with the gloves off, meaning that fascism was pure capitalism without democratic rights and organizations.\u201d","There are lots of things I don\'t understand - say, the latest debates over whether neutrinos have mass or the way that Fermat\'s last theorem was (apparently) proven recently.

And privelage and power typically doesn\'t want that and so they react and the high school teacher that tries to get students to think may find oppression, firing and so on.","The trick is not to be isolated\u2015if you\'re isolated, like Winston Smith in 1984, then sooner or later you\'re going to break, as he finally broke. That was the point of Orwell\'s story. In fact, the whole tradition of popular control has been exactly that: to keep people isolated, because if you can keep them isolated enough, you can get them to believe anything. But when people get together, all sorts of things are possible.","I am not a committed pacifist. I would not hold that it is under all imaginable circumstances wrong to use violence, even though use of violence is in some sense unjust. I believe that one has to estimate relative justices. But the use of violence and the creation of some degree of injustice can only be justified on the basis of the claim and the assessment-which always ought to be undertaken very, very seriously and with a good deal of scepticism that this violence is being exercised because a more just result is going to be achieved.","\u0648\u0641\u064a \u0647\u0630\u0647 \u0627\u0644\u0644\u062d\u0638\u0629 \u062a\u0642\u0648\u0645 \u0648\u0627\u0634\u0646\u0637\u0646 \u0628\u062a\u0639\u0644\u064a\u0645 \u0627\u0644\u0639\u0627\u0644\u0645 \u062f\u0631\u0633\u064b\u0627 \u0628\u0627\u0644\u063a \u0627\u0644\u0642\u0628\u062d \u0648\u0627\u0644\u062e\u0637\u0648\u0631\u0629: \u0625\u0630\u0627 \u0643\u0646\u062a \u062a\u0631\u064a\u062f \u0623\u0646 \u062a\u062f\u0627\u0641\u0639 \u0639\u0646 \u0646\u0641\u0633\u0643 \u0641\u064a \u0645\u0648\u0627\u062c\u0647\u062a\u0646\u0627\u060c \u0641\u0627\u0644\u0623\u0641\u0636\u0644 \u0644\u0643 \u0623\u0646 \u062a\u062d\u0627\u0643\u064a \u0643\u0648\u0631\u064a\u0627 \u0627\u0644\u0634\u0645\u0627\u0644\u064a\u0629\u060c \u0628\u062d\u064a\u062b \u062a\u0645\u062b\u0644 \u062e\u0637\u0631\u064b\u0627 \u0639\u0633\u0643\u0631\u064a\u064b\u0627 \u0630\u0627 \u0645\u0635\u062f\u0627\u0642\u064a\u0629 \u064a\u062a\u0647\u062f\u062f\u0646\u0627. ___ \u0645\u062f\u0627\u062e\u0644\u0627\u062a","\u2026jingoism, racism, fear, religious fundamentalism: these are the ways of appealing to people if you\u2019re trying to organize a mass base of support for policies that are really intended to crush them.","The core of the anarchist tradition, as I understand it, is that power is always illegitimate, unless it proves itself to be legitimate. So the burden of proof is always on those who claim that some authoritarian hierarchic relation is legitimate.

I mean, look: if you want to feel hopeless, there are a lot of things you could feel hopeless about.

And if you act on that assumption, then you\u2019re guaranteeing that that\u2019ll happen. If you act on the assumption that things can change, well, maybe they will. Okay, the only rational choice, given those alternatives, is to forget the pessimism.","In fact, the belief that neurophysiology is even relevant to the functioning of the mind is just hypothesis. Who knows if we\'re looking at the right aspects of the brain at all. Maybe there are other aspects of the brain that nobody has even dreamt of looking at yet. That\'s often happened in the history of science. When people say that the mental is the neurophysiological at a higher level, they\'re being radically unscientific. We know a lot about the mental from a scientific point of view. We have explanatory theories that account for a lot of things. The belief that neurophysiology is implicated in these things could be true, but we have every little evidence for it. So, it\'s just a kind of hope; look around and you see neurons; maybe they\'re implicated.","Structural factors are those such as ownership and control, dependence on other major funding sources (notably, advertisers), and mutual interests and relationships between the media and those who make the news and have the power to define it and explain what it means. The propaganda model also incorporates other closely related factors such as the ability to complain about the media\u2019s treatment of news (that is, produce \u201cflak), to provide \u201cexperts\u201d to confirm the official slant on the news, and to fix the basic principles and ideologies that are taken for granted by media personnel and the elite, but are often resisted by the general population.1 In our view, the same underlying power sources that own the media and fund them as advertisers, that serve as primary definers of the news, and that produce flak and proper-thinking experts, also play a key role in fixing basic principles and the dominant ideologies. We believe that what journalists do, what they see as newsworthy, and what they take for granted as premises of their work are frequently well explained by the incentives, pressures, and constraints incorporated into such a structural analysis. These structural factors that dominate media operations are not allcontrolling and do not always produce simple and homogeneous results.\u201d","If we do not believe in freedom of speech for those we despise we do not believe in it at all.","authority, unless justified, is inherently illegitimate and that the burden of proof is on those in authority.

In essence, the private media are major corporations selling a product (readers and audiences) to other businesses (advertisers). The national media typically target and serve elite opinion, groups that, on the one hand, provide an optimal \u201cprofile for advertising purposes, and, on the other, play a role in decision-making in the private and public spheres. The national media would be failing to meet their elite audience\u2019s needs if they did not present a tolerably realistic portrayal of the world. But their \u201csocietal purpose\u201d also requires that the media\u2019s interpretation of the world reflect the interests and concerns of the sellers, the buyers, and the governmental and private institutions dominated by these groups.\u201d","They have the same point of view.

The United Statesis off the spectrum of the main tradition in this respect: what\'s called \\"libertarianism\\" here is unbridled capitalism. Now, that\'s always been opposed in the European libertarian tradition, where every anarchist has been a socialist\u2014because the point is, if you have unbridled capitalism, you have all kinds of authority: you have extreme authority. If capital is privately controlled, then people are going to have to rent themselves in order to survive. Now, you can say, \\"they rent themselves freely, it\'s a free contract\\"\u2014but that\'s a joke. If your choice is, \\"do what I tell you or starve,\\" that\'s not a choice\u2014it\'s in fact what was commonly referred to as wage slavery in more civilized times, like the eighteenth and nineteenth centuries, for example. The American version of \\"libertarianism\\" is an aberration, though\u2014nobody really takes it seriously. I mean, everybody knows that a society that worked by American libertarian principles would self-destruct in three seconds. The only reason people pretend to take it seriously is because you can use it as a weapon. Like, when somebody comes out in favor of a tax, you can say: \\"No, I\'m a libertarian, I\'m against that tax\\"\u2014but of course, I\'m still in favor of the government building roads, and having schools, and killing Libyans, and all that sort of stuff.Now, there are consistent libertarians, people like Murray Rothbard [American academic]\u2014and if you just read the world that they describe, it\'s a world so full of hate that no human being would want to live in it. This is a world where you don\'t have roads because you don\'t see any reason why you should cooperate in building a road that you\'re not going to use: if you want a road, you get together with a bunch of other people who are going to use that road and you build it, then you charge people to ride on it. If you don\'t like the pollution from somebody\'s automobile, you take them to court and you litigate it. Who would want to live in a world like that? It\'s a world built on hatred.The whole thing\'s not even worth talking about, though. First of all, it couldn\'t function for a second-and if it could, all you\'d want to do is get out, or commit suicide or something. But this is a special American aberration, it\'s not really serious.","The \\"change\\" that Trump is likely to bring will be harmful or worse, but it is understandable that the consequences are not clear to isolated people in an atomized society lacking the kinds of associations (like unions) that can educate and organize.","Students who acquire large debts putting themselves through school are unlikely to think about changing society. When you trap people in a system of debt, they can\u2019t afford the time to think.

See, this is a very arid region, so water is more important than oil, and there are very limited water resources in Israel. In fact, a lot of the wars in the Middle East have been about water\u2014for instance, the wars involving Israel and Syria have usually been about the headwaters of the Jordan, which come from Syria, Jordan, and Lebanon. And as a matter of fact, one of the main reasons why Israel is holding on to the so-called \u201cSecurity Zone it seized in southern Lebanon [in the 1982 invasion] is that that area includes a mountain, Mount Hermon, which is a big part of the watershed that brings water to the region.\u201d","What you\u2019re referring to is what\u2019s called \u201ctheory. And when I said I\u2019m not interested in theory, what I meant is, I\u2019m not interested in posturing\u2013using fancy terms like polysyllables and pretending you have a theory when you have no theory whatsoever. So there\u2019s no theory in any of this stuff, not in the sense of theory that anyone is familiar with in the sciences or any other serious field.

And in fact, most of the people who make it through the education system and get into the elite universities are able to do it because they\'ve been willing to obey a lot of stupid orders for years and years\u2015that\'s the way I did it, for example. Like, you\'re told by some stupid teacher, \\"Do this,\\" which you know makes no sense whatsoever, but you do it, and if you do it you get to the next rung, and then you obey the next order, and finally you work your way through and they give you your letters: an awful lot of education is like that, from the very beginning.

But you do it, or else you\'re out: you ask too many questions and you\'re going to get in trouble.

And the very unfortunate tendency is to try to beat them down, because they\'re a pain in the neck. But what they ought to be is encouraged. Yeah: why take my word for it? Who the heck am I?

For instance, when you stop your five year old kid from trying to cross the street, that\'s an authoritarian situation: it\'s got to be justified. Well, in that case you can give a justification. But the burden of proof for any exercise of authority is always on the person exercising it - invariably. And when you look, most of the time those authority structures have no justification: they have no moral justification, they have no justification in the interests of the person lower in the hierarchy, or in the interests of other people, or the environment, or the future, or the society, or anything else - they are just there in order to preserve certain structures of power and domination, and the people at the top.","European settlers coming to a foreign land, settling there, and either committing genocide against or expelling the indigenous people.

Official violence, which is far more extensive in both scale and destructiveness, is placed in a different category altogether. This usage has nothing to do with justice, causal sequence, or numbers abused. Whatever the actual sequence of cause and effect, official violence is described as responsive or provoked (\\"retaliation,\\" \\"protective reaction,\\" etc.), not as the active and initiating source of abuse. Similarly, the massive long-term violence inherent in the oppressive social structures that U.S. power has supported or imposed is typically disregarded. The numbers tormented and killed by official violence-wholesale as opposed to retail terror-during recent decades have exceeded those of unofficial terrorists by a factor running into the thousands. But this is not \\"terror,\\" [...] \\"security forces\\" only retaliate and engage in \\"police action.\\"These terminological devices serve important functions. They help to justify the far more extensive violence of (friendly) state authorities by interpreting them as \\"reactive\\" and they implicitly sanction the suppression of information on the methods and scale of official violence by removing it from the category of \\"terrorism.\\" [...] Thus the language is well-designed for apologetics for wholesale terror.","Corporations with their political allies are waging an unrelenting class war against working people.","... if we adopt the principle of universality: if an action is right (or wrong) for others, it is right (or wrong) for us.

They mean as much as whether you support the people in Iowa. Of course, there was an issue. The issue was, Do you support our policy? But you don\u2019t want people to think about that issue. That\u2019s the whole point of good propaganda. You want to create a slogan that nobody\u2019s going to be against, and everybody\u2019s going to be for. Nobody knows what it means, because it doesn\u2019t mean anything. Its crucial value is that it diverts your attention from a question that does mean something: Do you support our policy?\u201d","Take democracy. According to the common-sense meaning, a society is democratic to the extent that people can participate in a meaningful way in managing their affairs. But the doctrinal meaning of democracy is different\u2014it refers to a system in which decisions are made by sectors of the business community and related elites. The public are to be only \u201cspectators of action, not \u201cparticipants,\u201d as leading democratic theorists (in this case, Walter Lippmann) have explained.

But Sen is correct; they\u2019re not intended, just like the Chinese famine wasn\u2019t intended.

Because Third World intellectuals are badly needed in popular movements, they can make contributions. And a lot of them is drawn away from this: antropologists, sociologists and others. They are drawn away in this arcane, and in my view, mostly meaningless discourses and are disassociated from popular struggles. And you can see the impact. They really indicate that the level of irrationality that grows out of this undermines the oportunities for doing something really significant and important. It is like consumerism because it diverts people from concentrating in a serious way and doing something about their own problems.","And the spectators must not be allowed to see too much.

But he studied various political systems - oligarchy, monarchy - and didn\'t like any of the particularly. He said democracy is probably the best system, but it has problems, and he was concerned with the problems. One problem that he was concerned with is quite striking because it runs right up to the present. He pointed out that in a democracy, if the people - people didn\'t mean people, it meant freemen, not slaves, not women - had the right to vote, the poor would be the majority, and they would use their voting power to take away property from the rich, which wouldn\'t be fair, so we have to prevent this.James Madison made the same pint, but his model was England. He said if freemen had democracy, then the poor farmers would insist on taking property from the rich. They would carry out what we these days call land reform. and that\'s unacceptable. Aristotle and Madison faced the same problem but made the opposite decisions. Aristotle concluded that we should reduce ineqality so the poor wouldn\'t take property from the rich. And he actually propsed a visin for a city that would put in pace what we today call welfare-state programs, common meals, other support systems. That would reduce inequality, and with it the problem of the poor taking property from the rich. Madison\'s decision was the opposite. We should reduce democracy so the poor won\'t be able to get together to do this.If you look at the design of the U.S. constitutional system, it followed Madison\'s approach. The Madisonian system placed power in the hands of the Senate. The executive in those days was more or less an administrator, not like today. The Senate consisted of \\"the wealth of the nation,\\" those who had sympathy for property owners and their rights. That\'s where power should be. The Senate, remember, wasn\'t elected. It was picked by legislatures, who were themselves very much subject to control by the rich and the powerful. The House, which was closer to the population, had much less power. And there were all sorts of devices to keep people from participation too much - voting restrictions and property restrictions. The idea was to prevent the threat of democracy. This goal continues right to the present. It has taken different forms, but the aim remains the same.","I personally never expected anything of Obama, and wrote about it before the 2008 primaries. I thought it was smoke and mirrors [...] I don\'t usually admire Sarah Palin, but when she was making fun of this \'hopey changey\' stuff, she was right, there was nothing there. And it was understood by the people who run the political system, and so it\'s no great secret that the US electoral system is mainly a public relations extravaganza...it\'s sort of a marketing affair.","They declare that it is unpatriotic and disruptive to question the workings of authority--but patriotic to institute harsh and regressive policies that benefit the wealthy, undermine social programs that serve the needs of the great majority, and subordinate a frightened population to increased state control.","I mean, you can pretend up to a certain point that the world has infinite resources and that it\'s an infinite wastebasket-but at some point you\'re going to run into the reality, which is that that isn\'t true.","I remember the philosopher Bertrand Russell was asked why he spent his time protesting against nuclear war and getting arrested on demonstrations.

Everybody here applauds that book, but nobody is willing to think about what it means. What Winston Smith [the main character] was saying is, if we can still understand that 2 + 2 = 4, they haven\'t taken everything away. Okay? Well, in the United States, people can\'t even understand that 2 + 2 = 4.","Or I remember in 1987, when there was a big hoopla about the bicentennial of the Constitution, the Boston Globe published one of my favorite polls, in which they gave people little slogans and said, \\"Guess which ones are in the Constitution.\\" Of course, nobody knows what\'s in the Constitution, because everybody forgot what they learned in third grade, and probably they didn\'t pay any attention to it then anyway\u2015so what the question really was asking is, \\"What is such an obvious truism that it must be in the Constitution?\\" Well, one of the suggestions was, \\"What about \'From each according to his ability, to each according to his needs\'?\\" [a slogan from Karl Marx]. Half the American population thinks that\'s in the Constitution, because it\'s such an obvious truth\u2015it\'s so obviously true that it must be in the Constitution, where else could it come from?","Aristotle\u2019s Politics, Book III, Chapter 8 The real difference between democracy and oligarchy is between poverty and wealth. Wherever the rulers, whether they be a minority or a majority, owe their power to wealth, that is an oligarchy. Wherever the poor rule, that is a democracy. Usually, where the rulers hold power by wealth, they are few, but where the poor rule, they are many, because few men are rich but all are free [if they are citizens in a city-state], and wealth and freedom are the grounds on which the two groups lay claim to government. Democracy is not necessarily only wherever the multitude has authority. Oligarchy is not necessarily wherever a minority has power over the system of government. If the majority of a citystate were wealthy and had authority, nobody would call it a democracy, just as if a small group of poor men had control over a larger rich population, nobody would call it an oligarchy. Rather, democracy is when every free citizen has authority and oligarchy is when the rich have it. Democracy is when there is a majority of free, poor men who have authority to rule, while oligarchy is when it is in the hands of the wealthy and well-born, who are a minority.","Respectable opinion would never consider an assessment of the Reagan Doctrine or earlier exercises in terms of their actual human costs, and could not comprehend that such an assessment\u2014which would yield a monstrous toll if accurately conducted on a global scale\u2014might perhaps be a proper task in the United States. At the same level of integrity, disciplined Soviet intellectuals are horrified over real or alleged American crimes, but perceive their own only as benevolent intent gone awry, or errors of an earlier day, now overcome; the comparison is inexact and unfair, since Soviet intellectuals can plead fear as an excuse for their services to state violence.","what are called opinions \u201con the left and \u201con the right\u201d in the media represent only a limited spectrum of debate, which reflects the range of needs of private power\u2014but there\u2019s essentially nothing beyond those \u201cacceptable\u201d positions.

That fact, once again, sends a strong message to Americans. It is their task to cure the dysfunctional political system, in which popular opinion is a marginal factor. The disparity between public opinion and policy, in this case, has significant implications for the fate of the world.","The last paradox is that the tale of Palestine from the beginning until today is a simple story of colonialism and dispossession, yet the world treats it as a multifaceted and complex story\u2014hard to understand and even harder to solve.","We should not forget Adam Smith\u2019s perspicuous observation that the \u201cmasters of mankind\u2014in his day, the merchants and manufacturers of England\u2014never cease to pursue their \u201cvile maxim\u201d: \u201cAll for ourselves, and nothing for other people.\u201d","In effect, the large bureaucracies of the powerful subsidize the mass media, and gain special access by their contribution to reducing the media\'s costs of acquiring the raw materials of, and producing, news. The large entities that provide this subsidy become \\"routine\\" news sources have privileged access to the gates. Non-routine sources must struggle for access, and may be ignored by the arbitrary decision of the gatekeepers. It should also be noted that in the case of the largesse of the Pentagon and the State Department\'s Office of Public Diplomacy, the subsidy is at the taxpayers\' expense, so that, in effect, the citizenry pays to be propagandized in the interest of powerful groups such as military contractors and other sponsors of state terrorism.","(...) rationality is a very narrowly restricted skill.","The Palestinians were offered two options: 1) to accept life in an Israeli open prison and enjoy limited autonomy and the right to work as underpaid laborers in Israel, bereft of any workers\u2019 rights, or 2) resist, even mildly, and risk living in a maximum-security prison, subjected to instruments of collective punishment, including house demolitions, arrests without trial, expulsions, and in severe cases, assassinations and murder.","I think that\u2019s a terrific technique of propaganda. To impose concision is a way of virtually guaranteeing that the party line gets repeated over and over again, and that nothing else is heard.","That is neoliberal democracy in a nutshell: trivial debate over minor issues by parties that basically pursue the same pro-business policies regardless of formal differences and campaign debate. Democracy is permissible as long as the control of business is off-limits to popular deliberation or change; i.e. so long as it isn\u2019t democracy.","The picture of the world that\'s presented to the public has only the remotest relation to reality. The truth of the matter is buried under edifice after edifice of lies upon lies. It\'s all been a marvellous success from the point of view in deterring the threat of democracy, achieved under conditions of freedom, which is extremely interesting.","If there was an observer on Mars, they would probably be amazed that we have survived this long. There are two problems for our species\' survival - nuclear war and environmental catastrophe - and we\'re hurtling towards them. Knowingly. This hypothetical Martian would probably conclude that human beings were an evolutionary error.","The winning candidate, now the president elect, calls for rapid increase in use of fossil fuels, including coal; dismantling of regulations; rejection of help to developing countries that are seeking to move to sustainable energy; and in general, racing to the cliff as fast as possible.Trump has already taken steps to dismantle the Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) by placing in charge of the EPA transition a notorious (and proud) climate change denier, Myron Ebell. Trump\'s top adviser on energy, billionaire oil executive Harold Hamm, announced his expectations, which were predictable: dismantling regulations, tax cuts for the industry (and the wealthy and corporate sector generally), more fossil fuel production, lifting Obama\'s temporary block on the Dakota Access pipeline. The market reacted quickly. Shares in energy corporations boomed, including the world\'s largest coal miner, Peabody Energy, which had filed for bankruptcy, but after Trump\'s victory, registered a 50 percent gain.","If you\u2019ve ever taken an economics course you know that markets are supposed to be based on informed consumers making rational choices. I don\u2019t have to tell you, that\u2019s not what\u2019s done. If advertisers lived by market principles then some enterprise, say, General Motors, would put on a brief announcement of their products and their properties, along with comments by Consumer Reports magazine so you could make a judgment about it.That\u2019s not what an ad for a car is\u2014an ad for a car is a football hero, an actress, the car doing some crazy thing like going up a mountain or something. If you\u2019ve ever turned on your television set, you know that hundreds of millions of dollars are spent to try to create uninformed consumers who will make irrational choices\u2014that\u2019s what advertising is.","Come at me bro!","In Bangladesh alone, tens of millions are expected to have to flee from low-lying plains in coming years because of sea level rise and more severe weather, creating a migrant crisis that will make today\'s pale in significance. With considerable justice, Bangladesh\'s leading climate scientist says that \\"These migrants should have the right to move to the countries from which all these greenhouse gases are coming. Millions should be able to go to the United States.\\" And to the other rich countries that have grown wealthy while bringing about a new geological era, the Anthropocene, marked by radical human transformation of the environment.","The United States was a settler-colonial society, the most brutal form of imperialism. You\u2019d need to overlook the fact that you\u2019re getting a richer, freer life by virtue of decimating the indigenous population, the first great \u201coriginal sin of American society; and massive slavery of another segment of the society, the second great sin (we\u2019re still living with the effects of both of them); and then overlook bitterly exploited labor, overseas conquests, and so on. Just overlook those small details and then there\u2019s a certain truth to our ideals.\u201d","Real wages have been declining for twenty years. People are working harder, they have to work longer hours, they have less security things are just looking bad for a lot of people, especially young people. I mean, very few people expect the future for their children to be anything like what they had, and entry-level wages in the United States have just declined radically in the last fifteen years-for instance, wages you get for your first job after high school are now down 30 percent for males and 18 percent for females over 1980, and that just kind of changes your picture of life.","So we know that human nature, and that includes our nature, yours and mine, can very easily turn people into quite efficient torturers and mass-murderers and slave-drivers...To the extent that the statement is true, and there is such an extent, it\'s just not relevant: human nature also has the capacity to lead to selflessness, and cooperation, and sacrifice, and support, and solidarity, and tremendous courage, and lots of other things too.","The record of anarchist ideas, and even more, of the inspiring struggles of people who have sought to liberate themselves from oppression and domination, must be treasured and preserved, not as means of freezing thought and conception in some new mold but as basis for understanding of the social reality and committed work to change it. There is no reason to suppose that history is at an end, that the current structures of authority and domination are graven in stone. It would also be great error to underestimate the power of social forces that will fight to maintain power and privilege.","If capital is privately controlled, then people are going to have to sell themselves in order to survive. Now, you can say, \\"they rent themselves freely, it\'s a free contract\\" - but that\'s a joke. If your choice is, \\"do what I tell you or starve\\", that\'s not a choice - it\'s infact what was commonly referred to as \'wage slavery\' in more civilized times, like the eighteenth and nineteenth centuries.","If you\'re teaching, say, physics, there\'s no point in persuading a student that you\'re right. You want to encourage them to find out what the truth is, which is probably that you\'re wrong.","Just war theory has been converted into a form of apologetics for whatever atrocities your favored state is carrying out.","How many Vietnamese casualties would you estimate that there were during the Vietnam war? The average response on the part of Americans today is about 100,000. The official figure is about two million. The actual figure is probably three to four million. The people who conducted the study raised an appropriate question: What would we think about German political culture if, when you asked people today how many Jews died in the Holocaust, they estimated about 300,000? What would that tell us about German political culture?","You hear it in every political speech, \u201cvote for me, we\u2019ll get the dream back. They all reiterate it in similar words\u2014you even hear it from people who are destroying the dream, whether they know it or not. But the \u201cdream\u201d has to be sustained, otherwise how are you going to get people in the richest, most powerful country in world history, with extraordinary advantages, to face the reality that they see around them? Inequality is really unprecedented. If you look at total inequality today, it\u2019s like the worst periods of American history. But if you refine it more closely, the inequality comes from the extreme wealth in a tiny sector of the population, a fraction of 1 percent. There were periods like the Gilded Age in the 1890s and the Roaring Twenties and so on, when a situation developed rather similar to this, but the current period is extreme. Because if you look at the wealth distribution, the inequality mostly comes from super-wealth\u2014literally, the top one-tenth of a percent are just super-wealthy. This is the result of over thirty years of a shift in social and economic policy. If you check you find that over the course of these years the government policy has been modified completely against the will of the population to provide enormous benefits to the very rich. And for most of the population, the majority, real incomes have almost stagnated for over thirty years. The middle class in that sense, that unique American sense, is under severe attack. A significant part of the American Dream is class mobility: You\u2019re born poor, you work hard, you get rich. The idea that it is possible for everyone to get a decent job, buy a home, get a car, have their children go to school . . . It\u2019s all collapsed.\u201d","Reading a book is an intellectual exercise, which stimulates thought, questions,","I got some funny reactions, a lot of irate reactions, as if I were somehow taking people\'s fun away from them. I have nothing against sports. I like to watch a good basketball game and that sort of thing. On the other hand, we have to recognise that the mass hysteria about spectator sports plays a significant role. First of all, spectator sports make people more passive, because you\'re not doing them; you\'re watching somebody doing them. Secondly, they engender jingoist and chauvinist attitudes, sometimes to quite an extreme degree. I saw something in the newspapers just a day or two ago about how high-school teams are now so antagonistic and passionately committed to winning at all costs that they had to abandon the standard handshake before or after the game. These kids can\'t even do civil things like greeting one another because they\'re ready to kill one another. It\'s spectator sports that engender those attitudes, particularly when they\'re designed to organise a community to be hysterically committed to their gladiators. That\'s very dangerous, and it has lots of deleterious effects.","If you abandon the political arena, somebody is going to be there. Corporations aren\'t going to go home and join the PTA. They are going to run things.","See, I focus my efforts against the terror and violence of my own state for really two main reasons. First of all, in my case the actions of my state happen to make up the main component of international violence in the world. But much more importantly than that, it\'s because American actions are the things that I can do something about. So even if the United States were causing only a tiny fraction of the repression and violence in the world-which obviously is very far from the truth-that tiny fraction would still be what I\'m responsible for, and what I should focus my efforts against. And that\'s based on a very simple ethical principle-namely, that the ethical value of one\'s actions depends on their anticipated consequences for human beings: I think that\'s kind of like a fundamental moral truism... Again, it\'s a very simple ethical point: you are responsible for the predictable consequences of your actions, you\'re not responsible for the predictable consequences of somebody else\'s actions.","One of the difficulties in raising public concern over the very severe threats of global warming is that 40 percent of the US population does not see why it is a problem, since Christ is returning in a few decades. About the same percentage believe that the world was created a few thousand years ago. If science conflicts with the Bible, so much the worse for science. It would be hard to find an analogue in other societies.","Talk about corporate greed and everything is really crucially beside the point, in my view, and really should be recognized as a very big regression from what working people, and a lot of others, understood very well a century ago. Talk about corporate greed is nonsense. Corporations are greedy by their nature. They\u2019re nothing else \u2013 they are instruments for interfering with markets to maximize profit, and wealth and market control. You can\u2019t make them more or less greedy; I mean maybe you can sort of force them, but it\u2019s like taking a totalitarian state and saying \u201cBe less brutal! Well yeah, maybe you can get a totalitarian state to be less brutal, but that\u2019s not the point \u2013 the point is not to get a tyranny to be less brutal, but to get rid of it. Now 150 years ago, that was understood. If you read the labour press \u2013 there was a very lively labour press, right around here [Massachusetts] ; Lowell and Lawrence and places like that, around the mid nineteenth century, run by artisans and what they called factory girls; young women from the farms who were working there \u2013 they weren\u2019t asking the autocracy to be less brutal, they were saying get rid of it. And in fact that makes perfect sense; these are human institutions, there\u2019s nothing graven in stone about them. They [corporations] were created early in this century with their present powers, they come from the same intellectual roots as the other modern forms of totalitarianism \u2013 namely Stalinism and Fascism \u2013 and they have no more legitimacy than they do. I mean yeah, let\u2019s try and make the autocracy less brutal if that\u2019s the short term possibility \u2013 but we should have the sophistication of, say, factory girls in Lowell 150 years ago and recognize that this is just degrading and intolerable and that, as they put it \u201cthose who work in the mills should own them \u201d And on to everything else, and that\u2019s democracy \u2013 if you don\u2019t have that, you don\u2019t have democracy.\u201d","These sectors of the doctrinal system serve to divert the unwashed masses and reinforce the basic social values: passivity, submissiveness to authority, the overriding virtue of greed and personal gain, lack of concern for others, fear of real or imagined enemies, etc. The goal is to keep the bewildered herd bewildered. It\'s unnecessary for them to trouble themselves with what\'s happening in the world. In fact, it\'s undesirable -- if they see too much of reality they may set themselves to change it.","These facts have been completely removed from history. One has to practically scream them from the rooftops.","[Ron Paul\'s politics] is just savagery, and it goes across the board; in fact, this holds for the whole libertarian ideology. I mean, it may sound nice on the surface, but when you think it through, it\'s just a call for corporate tyranny; takes away any barrier to corporate tyranny. Its a step towards the worst... but its all academic \'cause the business world would never permit it to happen, since it would destroy the economy. I mean, they can\'t live without a powerful \'nanny-state\'. They know it.","The hypothesis advanced by the propaganda model, excluded from debate as unthinkable, is that in dealing with the American wars in Indochina, the media were \\"unmindful\\", but highly \\"patriotic\\" in the special and misleading sense that they kept -- and keep -- closely to the perspective of official Washington and the closely related corporate elite, in conformity to the general \\"journalistic-literary-political culture\\" from which \\"the left\\" (meaning dissident opinion that questions jingoist assumptions) is virtually excluded. The propaganda model predicts that this should be generally true not only of the choice of topics covered and the way they are covered, but also, and far more crucially, of the general background of the presuppositions within which the issues are framed and the news presented. Insofar as there is debate among dominant elites, it will be reflected within the media, which in this narrow sense, may adopt an \\"adversarial stance\\" with regard to those holding office, reflecting elite dissatisfaction with current policy. Otherwise the media will depart from elite consensus only rarely and in limited ways. Even when large parts of the general public break free of the premises of the doctrinal system, as finally happened during the Indochina wars, real understanding based upon an alternative conception of the evolving history can be developed only with considerable effort by the most diligent and skeptical.

[Source: Al Jazeera \'Upfront\' interview]","MAN: Mr. Chomsky, I\u2019m wondering what specific qualifications you have to be able to speak all around the country about world affairs?\xa0None whatsoever. I mean, the qualifications that I have to speak on world affairs are exactly the same ones Henry Kissinger has, and Walt Rostow has, or anybody in the Political Science Department, professional historians\u2014none, none that you don\u2019t have. The only difference is, I don\u2019t pretend to have qualifications, nor do I pretend that qualifications are needed. I mean, if somebody were to ask me to give a talk on quantum physics, I\u2019d refuse\u2014because I don\u2019t understand enough. But world affairs are trivial: there\u2019s nothing in the social sciences or history or whatever that is beyond the intellectual capacities of an ordinary fifteen-year-old. You have to do a little work, you have to do some reading, you have to be able to think, but there\u2019s nothing deep\u2014if there are any theories around that require some special kind of training to understand, then they\u2019ve been kept a carefully guarded secret.In fact, I think the idea that you\u2019re supposed to have special qualifications to talk about world affairs is just another scam\u2014it\u2019s kind of like Leninism [position that socialist revolution should be led by a \u201cvanguard party]: it\u2019s just another technique for making the population feel that they don\u2019t know anything, and they\u2019d better just stay out of it and let us smart guys run it. In order to do that, what you pretend is that there\u2019s some esoteric discipline, and you\u2019ve got to have some letters after your name before you can say anything about it. The fact is, that\u2019s a joke.\xa0MAN: But don\u2019t you also use that system too, because of your name-recognition and the fact that you\u2019re a famous linguist? I mean, would I be invited to go somewhere and give talks?\xa0You think I was invited here because people know me as a linguist? Okay, if that was the reason, then it was a bad mistake. But there are plenty of other linguists around, and they aren\u2019t getting invited to places like this\u2014so I don\u2019t really think that can be the reason. I assumed that the reason is that these are topics that I\u2019ve written a lot about, and I\u2019ve spoken a lot about, and I\u2019ve demonstrated a lot about, and I\u2019ve gone to jail about, and so on and so forth\u2014I assumed that\u2019s the reason. If it\u2019s not, well, then it\u2019s a bad mistake. If anybody thinks that you should listen to me because I\u2019m a professor at M.I.T., that\u2019s nonsense. You should decide whether something makes sense by its content, not by the letters after the name of the person who says it. And the idea that you\u2019re supposed to have special qualifications to talk about things that are common sense, that\u2019s just another scam\u2014it\u2019s another way to try to marginalize people, and you shouldn\u2019t fall for it.\u201d","Speaking truth to power makes no sense. There\'s no point in speaking truth to Henry Kissinger, he knows it already. Instead speak truth to the powerless. Or better, with the powerless. Then they\'ll act to dismantle illegitimate power.","One of the functions that things like professional sports play, in our society and others, is to offer an area to deflect people\'s attention from things that matter, so that the people in power can do what matters without public interference.","the basic principle I would like to see communicated to people is the idea that every form of authority and domination and hierarchy, every authoritarian structure, has to prove that it\u2019s justified\u2014it has no prior justification. For instance, when you stop your five-year-old kid from trying to cross the street, that\u2019s an authoritarian situation: it\u2019s got to be justified. Well, in that case, I think you can give a justification. But the burden of proof for any exercise of authority is always on the person exercising it\u2014invariably.","You\u2019ve said, \u201cYou can lie or distort the story of the French Revolution as long as you like and nothing will happen. Propose a false theory in chemistry and it will be refuted tomorrow. How does your approach to the world as a scientist affect and influence the way you approach politics? Nature is tough. You can\u2019t fiddle with Mother Nature, she\u2019s a hard taskmistress. So you\u2019re forced to be honest in the natural sciences. In the soft fields, you\u2019re not forced to be honest. There are standards, of course; on the other hand, they\u2019re very weak. If what you propose is ideologically acceptable, that is, supportive of power systems, you can get away with a huge amount. In fact, the difference between the conditions that are imposed on dissident opinion and on mainstream opinion is radically different. For example, I\u2019ve written about terrorism, and I think you can show without much difficulty that terrorism pretty much corresponds to power. I don\u2019t think that\u2019s very surprising. The more powerful states are involved in more terrorism, by and large. The United States is the most powerful, so it\u2019s involved in massive terrorism, by its own definition of terrorism. Well, if I want to establish that, I\u2019m required to give a huge amount of evidence. I think that\u2019s a good thing. I don\u2019t object to that. I think anyone who makes that claim should be held to very high standards. So, I do extensive documentation, from the internal secret records and historical record and so on. And if you ever find a comma misplaced, somebody ought to criticize you for it. So I think those standards are fine. All right, now, let\u2019s suppose that you play the mainstream game. You can say anything you want because you support power, and nobody expects you to justify anything. For example, in the unimaginable circumstance that I was on, say, Nightline, and I was asked, \u201cDo you think Kadhafi is a terrorist?\u201d I could say, \u201cYeah, Kadhafi is a terrorist.\u201d I don\u2019t need any evidence. Suppose I said, \u201cGeorge Bush is a terrorist.\u201d Well, then I would be expected to provide evidence\u2014\u201cWhy would you say that?\u201d In fact, the structure of the news production system is, you can\u2019t produce evidence. There\u2019s even a name for it\u2014I learned it from the producer of Nightline, Jeff Greenfield. It\u2019s called \u201cconcision.\u201d He was asked in an interview somewhere why they didn\u2019t have me on Nightline. First of all, he says, \u201cWell, he talks Turkish, and nobody understands it.\u201d But the other answer was, \u201cHe lacks concision.\u201d Which is correct, I agree with him. The kinds of things that I would say on Nightline, you can\u2019t say in one sentence because they depart from standard religion. If you want to repeat the religion, you can get away with it between two commercials. If you want to say something that questions the religion, you\u2019re expected to give evidence, and that you can\u2019t do between two commercials. So therefore you lack concision, so therefore you can\u2019t talk. I think that\u2019s a terrific technique of propaganda. To impose concision is a way of virtually guaranteeing that the party line gets repeated over and over again, and that nothing else is heard.\u201d","There\'s no point in reading a book if you let it pass before your eyes and then forget about it ten minutes later.

So the burden of proof is always on those who claim that some authoritarian hierarchic relation is legitimate. If they can\'t prove it, then it should be dismantled.Can you ever prove it? Well, it\'s a heavy burden of proof to bear, but I think sometimes you can bear it. So to take a homely example, if I\'m walking down the street with my four-year-old granddaughter, and she starts to run into the street, and I grab her arm and pull her back, that\'s an exercise of power and authority, but I can give a justification for it, and it\'s obvious what the justification would be. And maybe there are other cases where you can justify it. But the question that always should be asked uppermost in our mind is, \'Why should I accept it?\' It\'s the responsibility of those who exercise power to show that somehow it\'s legitimate. It\'s not the responsibility of anyone else to show that it\'s illegitimate. It\'s illegitimate by assumption, if it\'s a relation of authority among human beings which places some above others. That\'s illegitimate by assumption. Unless you can give a strong argument to show that it\'s right, you\'ve lost.","Willingness to be puzzled is a valuable trait to cultivate, from childhood to advanced inquiry.","The first step is developing an open and critical mind, taking the doctrines that are standard and questioning them.

That itself is an extremely good example of corporate propaganda.","The pattern of praise and punishment is a familiar one throughout history: those who line up in the service of the state are typically praised by the general intellectual community, and those who refuse to line up in service of the state are punished.","So in the twentieth century, there\u2019s a major current of American thought\u2015in fact, it\u2019s probably the dominant current among people who think about these things [political scientists, journalists, public relations experts and so on]\u2015which says that precisely because the state has lost the power to coerce, elites need to have more effective propaganda to control the public mind. That was Walter Lippmann\u2019s point of view, for example, to mention probably the dean of American journalists\u2015he referred to the population as a \u201cbewildered herd: we have to protect ourselves from \u201cthe rage and trampling of the bewildered herd.\u201d And the way you do it, Lippmann said, is by what he called the \u201cmanufacture of consent\u201d\u2015if you don\u2019t do it by force, you have to do it by the calculated \u201cmanufacture of consent.\u201d","NATO bombing of Serbia was undertaken by the \u2018international community,\u2019 according to consistent Western rhetoric\u2014although those who did not have their heads buried in the sand knew that it was opposed by most of the world, often quite vocally. Those who do not support the actions of wealth and power are not part of \u2018the global community.","I mean, if you accept the framework that says totalitarian command economies have the right to make these decisions, and if the wage levels and working conditions are fixed facts, then we have to make choices within those assumptions. Then you can make an argument that poor people here ought to lose their jobs to even poorer people somewhere else... because that increases the economic pie, and it\'s the usual story. Why make those assumptions? There are other ways of dealing with the problem. Take, for example rich people here. Take those like me who are in the top few percent of the income ladder. We could cut back our luxurious lifestyles, pay proper taxes, there are all sorts of things. I\'m not even talking about Bill Gates, but people who are reasonably privileged. Instead of imposing the burden on poor people here and saying \\"well, you poor people have to give up your jobs because even poorer people need them over there,\\" we could say \\"okay, we rich people will give up some small part of our ludicrous luxury and use it to raise living standards and working conditions elsewhere, and to let them have enough capital to develop their own economy, their own means.\\" Then the issue will not arise. But it\'s much more convenient to say that poor people here ought to pay the burden under the framework of command economies\u2014totalitarianism. But, if you think it through, it makes sense and almost every social issue you think about\u2014real ones, live ones, ones right on the table\u2014has these properties. We don\'t have to accept and shouldn\'t accept the framework of domination of thought and attitude that only allows certain choices to be made... and those choices almost invariably come down to how to put the burden on the poor. That\'s class warfare. Even by real nice people like us who think it\'s good to help poor workers, but within a framework of class warfare that maintains privilege and transfers the burden to the poor. It\'s a matter of raising consciousness among very decent people.","What\u2019s the point of being better than someone else?","Well, it\'s been obvious for centuries that capitalism is going to self-destruct: that\'s just inherent in the logic of system\u2015because to the extent that a system is capitalist, that means maximizing short-term profit and not being concerned with long-term effects. In fact, the motto of capitalism was, \\"private vices, public benefits\\"\u2015somehow it\'s gonna work out. Well, it doesn\'t work out, and it\'s never going to work out: if you\'re maximizing short-term profits without concern for the long-term effects, you are going to destroy the environment, for one thing. I mean, you can pretend up to a certain point that the world has infinite resources and that it\'s an infinite wastebasket\u2015but at some point you\'re going to run into the reality, which is that that isn\'t true. Well, we\'re running into that reality now\u2015and it\'s very profound. Take something like combustion: anything you burn, no matter what it is, is increasing the greenhouse effect\u2015and this was known to scientists decades ago, they knew exactly what was happening. But in a capitalist system, you don\'t care about long-term effects like that, what you have to care about is tomorrow\'s profits. So the greenhouse effect has been building for years, and there\'s no known technological fix on the horizon\u2015there may not be any answer to this, it could be so serious that there\'s no remedy. That\'s possible, and then human beings will turn out to have been a lethal mutation, which maybe destroys a lot of life with us. Or it could be that there\'s some way of fixing it, or some ameliorating way\u2015nobody knows.","what are called opinions \u201con the left and \u201con the right\u201d in the media represent only a limited spectrum of debate, which reflects the range of needs of private power\u2014but there\u2019s essentially nothing beyond those \u201cacceptable\u201d positions.\u201d","[...] a time when anarchists were truly fearsome \u2014less because they were willing to put a brick through a Starbucks window than because they had figured out how to organize themselves in a functional, egalitarian, and sufficiently productive society.","Propaganda campaigns in general have been closely attuned to elite interests. The Red scare of 1919-20 have served well to abort the union-organizing drive that followed World War I in the sell and other industries. The Truman-McCarthy Red scare helped inaugurate the Cold War and the permanent war economy, and it also served to weaken the progressive coalition of the New Deal years. The chronic focus on the plight of Soviet dissidents, on enemy killings in Cambodia, and on the Bulgarian Connection helped weaken the Vietnam syndrome, justify a huge arms buildup and a more aggressive foreign policy, and divert attention from upward redistribution of income that was the heart of Reagan\'s domestic economic program. The recent propaganda-disinformation attacks on Nicaragua have been needed to avert eyes from the savagery of the war in El Salvador and to justify the escalating U.S. investment in counterrevolution in Central America.","When the NSA\u2019s surveillance program was exposed by Edward Snowden\u2019s revelations, high officials claimed that it had prevented fifty-four terrorist acts. On inquiry, that was whittled down to a dozen. A high-level government panel then discovered that there was actually only one case: someone had sent $8,500 to Somalia. That was the total yield of the huge assault on the Constitution and, of course, on others throughout the world.","The seventh myth was that Israel intended to conduct a benevolent occupation but was forced to take a tougher attitude because of Palestinian violence. Israel regarded from the very beginning any wish to end the occupation\u2014whether expressed peacefully or through struggle\u2014as terrorism. From the beginning, it reacted brutally by collectively punishing the population for any demonstration of resistance.","Trickle-down economics \\"So long as power remains privately concentrated, everybody, everybody, has to be committed to one overriding goal, and that\'s to make sure that the rich folk are happy\u2014because, unless they are, nobody else is going to get anything. So, if you\'re a homeless person sleeping in the streets of Manhattan, let\'s say, your first concern must be that the guys in the mansions are happy\u2014because, if they\'re happy, then they\'ll invest, and the economy will work, and things will function, and then maybe something will trickle down to you somewhere along the line. But if they\'re not happy, everything\'s going to grind to a halt, and you\'re not even going to get anything trickling down.","Now there are two \\"functions\\" in a democracy: The specialized class, the responsible men,carry out the executive function, which means they do the thinking and planning and understand the common interests. Then, there is the bewildered herd, and they have a function in democracy too. Their function in ademocracy, he said, is to be \\"spectators,\\" not participants in action. But they have more of a function than that, because it\'s a democracy. Occasionally they are allowed to lend their weight to one or another member of the specialized class. In other words, they\'re allowed to say, \\"We want you to be our leader\\"or \\"We want you to be our leader.\\" That\'s because it\'s a democracy and not atotalitarian state. That\'s called an election. But once they\'ve lent their weightto one or another member of the specialized class they\'re supposed to sink back and become spectators of action, but not participants. That\'s in a properly functioning democracy.","Any attempt to solve a conflict has to touch upon its very core; the core, more often than not, lies in its history.","It [predatory capitalism] is incapable of meeting human needs that can be expressed only in collective terms, and its concept of competitive man who seeks only to maximize wealth and power, who subjects himself to market relationships, to exploitation and external authority, is antihuman and intolerable in the deepest sense.","the crisis of democracy as when normally passive and apathetic populations become organized and seek to enter the political arena to pursue their interests and demands, threatening stability and order.\u201d","Now, the popular perception certainly is that violence is greater today-but that\'s mostly propaganda: that\'s just a part of the whole effort to make people frightened, so that they\'ll abandon their rights.","To speak truth to power is not a particularly honorable vocation.","There may be no end to such discoveries, if civilization survives. A truly decent and honest person will always seek to discover forms of oppression, hierarchy, domination, and authority that infringe fundamental human rights. As some are overcome, others will be revealed that previously were not part of our conscious awareness. We thus come to a better understanding of who and what we are in our inner nature, and who and what we should be in our actual lives.

He said on Fox, \'The greatest hoax I think that has been around for many, many years if not hundreds of years has been this hoax on the environment and global warming.\' He doesn\'t provide any argument or evidence as to why he disregards the scientific consensus--just, I say so, period. With that attitude, you really are approaching the edge.","the mass media are interested in attracting audiences with buying power, not audiences per se; it is affluent audiences that spark advertiser interest today, as in the nineteenth century. The idea that the drive for large audiences makes the mass media \u201cdemocratic thus suffers from the initial weakness that its political analogue is a voting system weighted by income!\u201d","In a situation of occupation or domination, the occupier, the dominant power, has to justify what it\u2019s doing.

The very structure of the media is designed to induce conformity to established doctrine. In a three-minute stretch between commercials, or in seven hundred words, it is impossible to present unfamiliar thoughts or surprising conclusions with the argument and evidence required to afford them some credibility. Regurgitation of welcome pieties faces no such problem.","Bertrand Russell dan Albert Einstein sama-sama dikenal sebagai intelektual hebat. Keduanya sepakat bahanya tengah mengancam umat manusia. Tapi mereka memilih jalan yang berbeda untuk meresponnya. Einstein hidup dengan enak di Princeton dan mengabdikan dirinya semata-mata untuk riset seraya sesekali menyampaika orasi ilmiah, sementara Russell memilih demonstrasi di jalan. Ingin tahu hasilnya?

The corporate tax rate is already very low, but corporations have worked out an array of complicated techniques so they often don\'t have to pay taxes at all... The scale of sheer robbery by corporate power is enormous.","I mean, to talk about \\"corporate greed\\" is like talking about \\"military weapons\\" or something like that\u2015there just is no other possibility. A corporation is something that is trying to maximize power and profit: that\'s what it is. There is no \\"phenomenon\\" of corporate greed, and we shouldn\'t mislead people into thinking there is. It\'s like talking about \\"robber\'s greed\\" or something like that\u2015it\'s not a meaningful thing, it\'s misleading. A corporation\'s purpose is to maximize profit and market share and return to investors, and all that kind of stuff, and if its officers don\'t pursue that goal, for one thing they are legally liable for not pursuing it. There I agree with Milton Friedman [right-wing economist] and those guys: if you\'re a C.E.O., you must do that\u2015otherwise you\'re in dereliction of duty, in fact dereliction of duty. And besides that, if you don\'t do it, you\'ll get kicked out by the shareholders or the Board of Directors, and you won\'t be there very long anyway.","Our philosophy is to rob everything as much as possible and forget about tomorrow...But it makes a certain sense if the sole human value is making as much wealth as you can tomorrow.

Any form of concentrated power doesn\u2019t want to be subjected to popular democratic control\u2014or, for that matter, to market discipline.

The Reaganite intellectual Norman Podhoretz defined it as \u201cthe sickly inhibitions against the use of military force.\u201d There were these sickly inhibitions against violence on the part of a large part of the public. People just didn\u2019t understand why we should go around torturing people and killing people and carpet bombing them. It\u2019s very dangerous for a population to be overcome by these sickly inhibitions, as Goebbels understood, because then there\u2019s a limit on foreign adventures. It\u2019s necessary, as the Washington Post put it rather proudly during the Gulf War hysteria, to instill in people respect for \u201cmartial value.\u201d That\u2019s important. If you want to have a violent society that uses force around the world to achieve the ends of its own domestic elite, it\u2019s necessary to have a proper appreciation of the martial virtues and none of these sickly inhibitions about using violence. So that\u2019s the Vietnam Syndrome. It\u2019s necessary to overcome that one.\u201d","In fact, I should say to begin with that the term anarchism is quite a range of political ideas, but I would prefer to think of it as the libertarian left, and from that point of view anarchism can be conceived as a kind of voluntary socialism, that is, as libertarian socialist or anarcho-syndicalist or communist anarchist, in the tradition of say Bakunin and Kropotkin and others. They had in mind a highly organized form of society, but a society that was organized on the basis of organic units, organic communities. And generally they meant by that the workplace and the neighborhood, and from those two basic units there could derive through federal arrangements a highly integrated kind of social organization, which might be national or even international in scope. And the decisions could be made over a substantial range, but by delegates who are always part of the organic community from which they come, to which they return and in which, in fact, they live.","So if a person produces an object on command, Humboldt wrote, we may admire what he did but we will despise what he is, not a true human being who acts in his own impulses and desires.","Mass education was designed to turn independent farmers into docile, passive tools of production. That was its primary purpose. And don\u2019t think people didn\u2019t know it. They knew it and they fought against it. There was a lot of resistance to mass education for exactly that reason. It was also understood by the elites. Emerson once said something about how we\u2019re educating them to keep them from our throats.

Yet of all the major powers, China has been the least aggressive militarily.","A properly functioning system of indoctrination has a variety of tasks, some rather delicate. One of its targets is the stupid and ignorant masses. They must be kept that way, diverted with emotionally potent oversimplifications, marginalized, and isolated. Ideally, each person should be alone in front of the TV screen watching sports, soap operas, or comedies, deprived of organizational structures that permit individuals lacking resources to discover what they think and believe in interaction with others, to formulate their own concerns and programs, and to act to realize them. They can then be permitted, even encouraged, to ratify the decisions made by their betters in periodic elections. The \\"rascal multitude\\" are the proper targets of the mass media and a public education system geared to obedience and training in needed skills, including the skill of repeating patriotic slogans on timely occasions.","[W]e have a democracy that uses free elections to put in place known obstructionists, and a media that disproportionately gives a forum to economically driven ideology over sound science.","Governments are bigger than ever, but under neoliberalism they have far less pretense to being concerned with addressing non-corporate interests. And","[...] in a predatory capitalist economy, state intervention would be an absolute necessity to preserve human existence and to prevent the destruction of the physical environment [...].","Aristotle was right\u2014the way to overcome the paradox of democracy is by reducing inequality, not reducing democracy.","What does it mean to be truly educated?I think I can do no better about answering the question of what it means to be truly educated than to go back to some of the classic views on the subject. For example the views expressed by the founder of the modern higher education system, Wilhelm von Humboldt, leading humanist, a figure of the enlightenment who wrote extensively on education and human development and argued, I think, kind of very plausibly, that the core principle and requirement of a fulfilled human being is the ability to inquire and create constructively independently without external controls. To move to a modern counterpart, a leading physicist who talked right here [at MIT], used to tell his classes it\'s not important what we cover in the class, it\'s important what you discover. To be truly educated from this point of view means to be in a position to inquire and to create on the basis of the resources available to you which you\'ve come to appreciate and comprehend. To know where to look, to know how to formulate serious questions, to question a standard doctrine if that\'s appropriate, to find your own way, to shape the questions that are worth pursuing, and to develop the path to pursue them. That means knowing, understanding many things but also, much more important than what you have stored in your mind, to know where to look, how to look, how to question, how to challenge, how to proceed independently, to deal with the challenges that the world presents to you and that you develop in the course of your self education and inquiry and investigations, in cooperation and solidarity with others. That\'s what an educational system should cultivate from kindergarten to graduate school, and in the best cases sometimes does, and that leads to people who are, at least by my standards, well educated.\ufeff \u2015 Noam Chomsky\u201d","Freedom without opportunity is a devil\u2019s gift.","The first secretary of defense, General Henry Knox, said that what we\u2019re doing to the native population is worse than what the conquistadors did in Peru and Mexico. He said future historians will look at the \u201cdestruction of these people\u2014what would nowadays be called genocide\u2014and paint the acts with \u201csable colors\u201d [in other words, darkly]. This was known all the way through. Long after John Quincy Adams, the intellectual father of Manifest Destiny, left power, he became an opponent of both slavery and the policy toward the Indians. He said he\u2019d been involved\u2014along with the rest of them\u2014in a crime of \u201cextermination\u201d of such enormity that surely God would punish them for these \u201cheinous sins.\u201d","If you quietly accept and go along no matter what your feelings are, ultimately you internalize what you\'re saying, because it\'s too hard to believe one thing and say another.","Bakunin\'s warnings about the \\"Red bureaucracy\\" that would institute \\"the worst of all despotic governments\\" were long before Lenin, and were directed against the followers of Mr. Marx. There were, in fact, followers of many different kinds; Pannekoek, Luxemburg, Mattick and others are very far from Lenin, and their views often converge with elements of anarcho-syndicaIism. Korsch and others wrote sympathetically of the anarchist revolution in Spain, in fact. There are continuities from Marx to Lenin, but there are also continuities to Marxists who were harshly critical of Lenin and Bolshevism. Teodor Shanin\'s work in the past years on Marx\'s later attitudes towards peasant revolution is also relevant here. I\'m far from being a Marx scholar, and wouldn\'t venture any serious judgement on which of these continuities reflects the \\"real Marx,\\" if there even can be an answer to that question.","This impulse, never condemned or rebuked by a world that watched by and did nothing, led to the massive expulsion of 750,000 people (half of the region\u2019s population), the destruction of more than five hundred villages, and the demolition of a dozen towns in 1948.","Il existe deux ensembles de principes.

What would stop a former slave from going up into the hills, where there was plenty of land, and just living happily there? They hit on the same method that everyone hits on: try to capture them with consumer goods. So they offered teasers\u2014easy terms, gifts. And then when people got trapped into wanting consumer goods and started getting into debt at company stores, pretty soon you had a restoration of something similar to slavery, from the plantation owners\u2019 point of view.","The culture and ideology fostered in this globalization process relate largely to \u201clifestyle themes and goods and their acquisition; and they tend to weaken any sense of community helpful to civic life.\u201d","The economic system barely functions as it is\u2014I mean, the contemporary economic system is a complete catastrophe, an absolutely catastrophic failure. For instance, the International Labor Organization recently gave its latest estimate of unemployment worldwide\u2014\\"unemployment\\" they define as meaning not having enough work to meet a subsistence level, so maybe you can sell some handkerchiefs at a street corner or something, but you don\'t have enough work to survive on your own. They estimate that at about 30 percent of the world\'s population which makes it a lot worse than the Great Depression. Alright? Now, there\'s a ton of work to be done in the world-everywhere you look there\'s work that ought to be done. And the people who don\'t have work would be delighted to do it. So what you\'ve got is a huge number of idle hands, a vast amount of work that ought to be done, and an economic system that is incapable of putting those two things together. Okay, absolutely catastrophic failure.","Now is not the time to look at the past. Lets look forward to the future.Diplomats know very well that these are standard slogans for those who are engaged in serious crimes.","The Republican Party today has a catechism. If you want to be a candidate, with very rare exceptions, you have to repeat the catechism in lockstep uniformity: global warming isn\'t happening, no taxes on the rich. There are about ten things that you have to repeat, whether you believe them or not. Anybody who departs from them is in trouble.","The intelligent minority are a \u201cspecialized class who are responsible for setting policy and for \u201cthe formation of a sound public opinion,\u201d","The people who call themselves conservatives say, \'We have to maintain family values by preventing women from having a choice as to whether they will have children, and then by not giving them any support when they have to take care of their children. That\'s how we preserve family values.\' The internal contradictions are amazing.","In the 1950s, President Eisenhower and Secretary of State John Foster Dulles explained quite clearly the dilemma that the United States faced. They complained that the Communists had an unfair advantage: they were able to \\"appeal directly to the masses\\" and \\"get control of mass movements, something we have no capacity to duplicate. The poor people are the ones they appeal to and they have always wanted to plunder the rich.\\" That causes problems. The United States somehow finds it difficult to appeal to the poor with its doctrine that the rich should plunder the poor.","Well, it\'s hard to introspect, but to the extent that I introspect about it, it\'s because you basically have two choices. One choice is to assume the worst, and then you can be guaranteed that it\'ll happen. The other is to assume that there\'s some hope for change, in which case it\'s possible that you can help to effect change. So you\'ve got two choices, one guarantees the worst will happen, the other leaves open the possibility that things might get better. Given those choices, a decent person doesn\'t hesitate.","Since 1949, the United States has passed to Israel more than $100 billion in grants and $10 billion in special loans.36 Other bodies not part of the administration annually transfer to Israel $1 billion.

National media remained unperturbed in accordance to the doctrine that the United States stands above any law of international agreement.","This was a talk to an anarchist conference, and in my view the libertarian movements have been very shortsighted in pursuing doctrine in a rigid fashion without being concerned about the human consequences. So it\'s perfectly proper\u2026 I mean, in my view, and that of a few others, the state is an illegitimate institution. But it does not follow from that that you should not support the state. Sometimes there is a more illegitimate institution which will take over if you do not support this illegitimate institution. So, if you\'re concerned with the people, let\'s be concrete, let\'s take the United States. There is a state sector that does awful things, but it also happens to do some good things. As a result of centuries of extensive popular struggle there is a minimal welfare system that provides support for poor mothers and children. That\'s under attack in an effort to minimize the state. Well, anarchists can\'t seem to understand that they are to support that. So they join with the ultra-right in saying \\"Yes, we\'ve got to minimize the state,\\" meaning put more power into the hands of private tyrannies which are completely unaccountable to the public and purely totalitarian. It\'s kind of reminiscent of an old Communist Party slogan back in the early thirties \\"The worse, the better.\\" So there was a period when the Communist Party was refusing to combat fascism on the theory that if you combat fascism, you join the social democrats and they are not good guys, so \\"the worse, the better.\\" That was the slogan I remember from childhood. Well, they got the worse: Hitler. If you care about the question of whether seven-year-old children have food to eat, you\'ll support the state sector at this point, recognizing that in the long term it\'s illegitimate. I know that a lot of people find that hard to deal with and personally I\'m under constant critique from the left for not being principled. Principle to them means opposing the state sector, even though opposing the state sector at this conjuncture means placing power into the hands of private totalitarian organizations who would be delighted to see children starve. I think we have to be able to keep those ideas in our heads if we want to think constructively about the problems of the future. In fact, protecting the state sector today is a step towards abolishing the state because it maintains a public arena in which people can participate, and organize, and affect policy, and so on, though in limited ways. If that\'s removed, we\'d go back to a [...] dictatorship or say a private dictatorship, but that\'s hardly a step towards liberation.","an advertising-based system will tend to drive out of existence or into marginality the media companies and types that depend on revenue from sales alone.

The Oath of Of\xadfice says something about, I promise to do this, that, and the other thing,\u201d and Bush added the words, \u201dso help me God.\u201d Well, that\u2019s illegal: he\u2019s not President, if anybody cares.\u201d","The reality is that under capitalist conditions\u2015meaning maximization of short-term gain\u2015you\'re ultimately going to destroy the environment: the only question is when. Now, for a long time, it\'s been possible to pretend that the environment is an infinite source and an infinite sink. Neither is true obviously, and we\'re now sort of approaching the point where you can\'t keep playing the game too much longer. It may not be very far off. Well, dealing with that problem is going to require large-scale social changes of an almost unimaginable kind. For one thing, it\'s going to certainly require large-scale social planning, and that means participatory social planning if it\'s going to be at all meaningful. It\'s also going to require a general recognition among human beings that an economic system driven by greed is going to self-destruct\u2015it\'s only a question of time before you make the planet unlivable, by destroying the ozone layer or some other way. And that means huge socio-psychological changes have to take place if the human species is going to survive very much longer.

Every Stalinist said the same thing: \u201cWe sent Sakharov into exile and everyone was screaming. What about this or that other atrocity\u2014which is worse? There is always somebody who has committed a worse atrocity. For a Stalinist mimic like Solarz, why not use the same line?

Would Solarz claim that we all should be silent if he and his family were dumped into a desert in Mexico?\u201d","There are lots of planned economies-the United States is a planned economy, for example. I mean, we talk ourselves as a \\"free market\\", but that\'s baloney. The only parts of the U.S. economy that are internationally competitive are the planned parts, the state-subsidized parts--like capital-intensive agriculture (which has a state-guaranteed market as a cushion in case there are excesses); or high-technology industry (which is dependent on the Pentagon system); or pharmaceuticals (which is massively subsidized by publically funded research). Those are the parts of the U.S. economy that are functioning well.","The more you learn, the more you realize the less you know. You think you\u2019re approaching some kind of horizon, but in fact the horizon is receding, and the more you learn, the more you see that horizon is very far away","Actually, another problem which I think must be faced is that at any particular point in human history people have not understood what oppression is. It\'s something you learn. If go back to, say, my parents or grandmother, she didn\'t think she was oppressed by being in a super patriarchal family where the father would walk down the street and not recognize his daughter when she came because\u2014not because he didn\'t know who she was, but because you don\'t nod to your daughter. It didn\'t feel like oppression. It just felt like the way life works. I mean, what psychic effects it had internally\u2014well, that\'s a complicated question. But, as anyone involved in any kind of activism knows\u2014say the women\'s movement\u2014one of the first tasks is to get people to understand that they are living under conditions of oppression and domination. It isn\'t obvious, and who knows what forms of oppression and domination we are just accepting without even noticing them.

It\'s just that the next thing they\'ll ask is, \\"So how can we make some money off it?\\" In fact, anybody in business who didn\'t ask that question would find themselves out of business\u2014just because that\'s the way that capitalist institutions work. I mean, if some executive came along and said,\\" I\'m not going to look at it that way, I\'m going to do things differently,\\" well, they\'d get replaced by someone who would try to make more money off it\u2015because these are simply institutional facts, these are facts about the structure of the institutions.

I mean, it\'s not that some of these \\"P.C.\\" things they point out aren\'t true-yeah, sure, some of them are true.

He started the process of driving the rural population into what were called \'strategic hamlets,\' essentially concentration camps, where people were surrounded by barbed wire, supposedly to protect them from the guerillas who the U.S. government knew perfectly well they supported.

If you, this future historian or extraterrestrial observer, looked at who is in each group, you would see something strange indeed: those trying to mitigate or overcome these threats are the least developed societies\u2014the indigenous populations, or the remnants of them; tribal societies; and first nations in Canada. They\u2019re not talking about nuclear war but environmental disaster, and they\u2019re really trying to do something about it.","A human language is a system of remarkable complexity. To come to know a human language would be an extraordinary achievement for a creature not specifically designed to accomplish this task. A normal child acquires this knowledge on relatively slight exposure and without specific training. He can then quite effortlessly make use of an intricate structure of specific rules and guiding principles to convey his thoughts and feelings to others, arousing in them novel ideas and subtle perceptions and judgments.","Actually, if you looked closely, even N.A.F.T.A.\'s advocates conceded that it was probably going to harm the majority of the populations of the three countries. For instance, its advocates in the United States were saying, \\"It\'s really good, it\'ll only harm semi-skilled workers\\"\u2015footnote: 70 percent of the workforce. As a matter of fact, after N.A.F.T.A. was safely passed, the New York Times did their first analysis of its predicted effects in the New York region: it was a very upbeat article talking about how terrific it was going to be for corporate lawyers and P.R. firms and so on. And then there was a footnote there as well. It said, well, everyone can\'t gain, there\'ll also be some losers: \\"women, blacks, Hispanics, and semi-skilled labor\\"\u2015in other words, most of the people of New York. But you can\'t have everything. And those were the advocates.","There is tons of work to be done, and lots of people who would like to do the work.

On Martin Luther King Day, he\'s greatly celebrated for what he did in the early 1960s when he was saying \'I Have a Dream\' and \'let\'s get rid of racist sheriffs in Alabama.\' That was okay. By 1965 he was getting to be a dangerous figure. For one thing, he was turning against the war in Vietnam pretty strongly. For another, he was working to be at the head of a developing poor people\'s movement. He was assassinated when he was taking part in a strike of sanitation workers and he was on his way to Washington for a poor people\'s convention. He was going beyond racist sheriffs in Alabama to northern racism, which is much more deep-seated and class-based.","Well, I don\'t know the whole situation in detail, but my guess is that it\'s in Quebec\'s self-interest to stay part of Canada\u2015because the alternative is to become part of the United States. Quebec\'s not going to be able to remain independent, so it can either become part of the United States or stay part of Canada. And given that choice, I think it\'s better off staying part of Canada. I mean, if Quebec became independent from Canada, it wouldn\'t necessarily be called part of the United States\u2015like it wouldn\'t get colored the same as the United States on the map\u2015but it would be so integrated into the American economy that it would effectively be a colony.

You climb a peak, you think you\'re at the top--and then you notice there is a bigger peak right beyond it, and you\'ve got to climb that one. That\'s what popular struggle is like.

Every charismatic figure is such an obvious crook that he destroys himself, like McCarthy or Nixon or the evangelist preachers.

[Chomsky in an interview with Chris Hedges in 2010]","Don\u2019t tread on me I\u2019m not quite clear about how to formulate this question. It has to do with the nature of US society as exemplified in comments like do your own thing, go it alone, don\u2019t tread on me, the pioneer spirit\u2014 all that deeply individualistic stuff. What does that tell you about American society and culture? It tells you that the propaganda system is working full-time, because there is no such ideology in the US. Business certainly doesn\u2019t believe it. All the way back to the origins of American society, business has insisted on a powerful, interventionist state to support its interests, and it still does. There\u2019s nothing individualistic about corporations. They\u2019re big conglomerate institutions, essentially totalitarian in character. Within them, you\u2019re a cog in a big machine.

It\u2019s hardly don\u2019t tread on me\u2014you\u2019re being tread on all the time. The point of the ideology is to prevent people who are outside the sectors of coordinated power from associating with each other and entering into decision-making in the political arena. The point is to leave the powerful sectors highly integrated and organized, while atomizing everyone else. That aside, there is another factor. There\u2019s a streak of independence and individuality in American culture that I think is a very good thing.

And thus, the ways in which we understand the world are very much connected to the ways in which we interact with the world.","In reality, a few years later a North\u2013South compact permitted the slaveholding states to reinstitute a form of slavery by effectively criminalizing black life, providing a cheap and disciplined labor force for much of the industrial revolution, a system that persisted until World War II created the need for free labor. The ugly history is being reenacted under the vicious \u201cdrug war of the past generation, since Ronald Reagan.\u201d","Henry Ford introduced the assembly line, which was efficient but also a highly controlling device. There was a problem with the assembly line. It\u2019s so onerous that people dropped out. They couldn\u2019t stand it.

Those who are compelled to rent themselves to owners of capital in order to survive are deprived of one of the most fundamental rights: the right to productive, creative and fulfilling work under one\'s own control, in solidarity with others. And under the ideological constraints of capitalist democracy, the prime necessity is to satisfy the needs of those in a position to make investment decisions; if their demands are not satisfied, there will be no production, no work, no social services, no means for survival. All necessarily subordinate themselves and their interests to the overriding need to serve the interests of the owners and managers of the society, who, furthermore, with their control over resources, are easily able to shape the ideological system (the media, schools, universities and so on) in their interests, to determine the basic conditions within which the political process will function, its parameters and basic agenda, and to call upon the resources of state violence, when need be, to suppress any challenge to entrenched power. The point was formulated succinctly in the early days of the liberal democratic revolutions by John Jay, the President of the Continental Congress and the first Chief Justice of the United States Supreme Court: \\"The people who own the country ought to govern it.\\" And, of course, they do, whatever political faction may be in power. Matters could hardly be otherwise when economic power is narrowly concentrated and the basic decisions over the nature and character of life, the investment decisions, are in principle removed from democratic control.","It is very similar to late Weimar Germany, The parallels are striking. There was also tremendous disillusionment with the parliamentary system. The most striking fact about Weimar was not that the Nazis managed to destroy the Social Democrats and the Communists but that the traditional parties, the Conservative and Liberal parties, were hated and disappeared. It left a vacuum which the Nazis very cleverly and intelligently managed to take over. [Chomsky in a 2010 interview with Chris Hedges on the crisis of democracy in the United States]","The doctrinal system, which produces what we call \u201cpropaganda when discussing enemies, has two distinct targets. One target is what\u2019s sometimes called the \u201cpolitical class,\u201d the roughly 20% of the population that\u2019s relatively educated, more or less articulate, playing some role in decision-making. Their acceptance of doctrine is crucial, because they\u2019re in a position to design and implement policy. Then there\u2019s the other 80% or so of the population. These are Lippmann\u2019s \u201cspectators of action,\u201d whom he referred to as the \u201cbewildered herd.\u201d They are supposed to follow orders and keep out of the way of the important people. They\u2019re the target of the real mass media: the tabloids, the sitcoms, the Super Bowl and so on. These sectors of the doctrinal system serve to divert the unwashed masses and reinforce the basic social values: passivity, submissiveness to authority, the overriding virtue of greed and personal gain, lack of concern for others, fear of real or imagined enemies, etc. The goal is to keep the bewildered herd bewildered. It\u2019s unnecessary for them to trouble themselves with what\u2019s happening in the world. In fact, it\u2019s undesirable\u2014if they see too much of reality they may set themselves to change it.\u201d","I mean, remember what the Vietnam War was fought for, after all. The Vietnam War was fought to prevent Vietnam from becoming a successful model of economic and social development for the Third World. And we don\'t want to lose the war, Washington doesn\'t want to lose the war. So far we\'ve won: Vietnam is no model for development, it\'s a model for destruction. But if the Vietnamese could ever pull themselves together somehow, Vietnam could again become such a model\u2015and that\'s no good, we always have to prevent that.","It\'s plain that quite a high degree of thought and analysis is going into that. People know a tremendous amount. They know all sorts of complicated details, and enter into far-reaching discussion about whether the coach made the right decision yesterday, and so on. These are ordinary people, not professionals, who are applying their intelligence and analytic skills in these areas, and accumulating quite a lot of knowledge and, for all I know, understanding. On the other hand, when I hear people talk about, say, international affairs or domestic problems, it\'s at a level of superficiality which is beyond belief.","If capital is privately controlled, then people are going to have to rent themselves in order to survive.

If your choice is, \u201cdo what I tell you or starve,\u201d that\u2019s not a choice\u2014it\u2019s in fact what was commonly referred to as wage slavery in more civilized times, like the eighteenth and nineteenth centuries, for example.\u201d","It is useful to remember that no matter where we turn, there is rarely any shortage of elevated ideals to accompany the resort to violence.","The choice is ours, the choice is yours.","What about the role of the CIA in a democratic society? Is that an oxymoron? You could imagine a democratic society with an organization that carries out intelligence-gathering functions. But that\u2019s a very minor part of what the CIA does. Its main purpose is to carry out secret and usually illegal activities for the executive branch, which wants to keep these activities secret because it knows that the public won\u2019t accept them. So even inside the US, it\u2019s highly undemocratic. The activities that it carries out are quite commonly efforts to undermine democracy, as in Chile through the 1960s into the early 1970s. That\u2019s far from the only example. By the way, although most people focus on Nixon\u2019s and Kissinger\u2019s involvement with the CIA, Kennedy and Johnson carried out similar policies.","Parler des affaires du monde est une chose banale.

Those who remained became the Palestinian minority in Israel.

In general, nation-states have been imposed with substantial violence and repression for one reason\u2014because they seek to force varied and complex populations into a single mold.","Though they have been subjected to disgraceful treatment, the Palestinians in East Jerusalem are fortunate in comparison with those who are less visible, and therefore can be killed, tortured, humiliated, and driven from their destroyed homes and lands virtually at will.

But the joy of creation is something very few people get the opportunity to have in our society: artists get to have it, craftspeople have it, scientists.","In fact, the nature of Western systems of indoctrination is typically not understood by dictators, they don\u2019t understand the utility for propaganda purposes of having \u201ccritical debate that incorporates the basic assumptions of the official doctrines, and thereby marginalizes and eliminates authentic and rational critical discussion. Under what\u2019s sometimes been called \u201cbrainwashing under freedom,\u201d the critics, or at least, the \u201cresponsible critics\u201d make a major contribution to the cause by bounding the debate within certain acceptable limits\u2015that\u2019s why they\u2019re tolerated, and in fact even honored.\u201d","There has always been racism. But it developed as a leading principle of thought and perception in the context of colonialism. That\u2019s understandable. When you have your boot on someone\u2019s neck, you have to justify it. The justification has to be their depravity. It\u2019s very striking to see this in the case of people who aren\u2019t very different from one another. Take a look at the British conquest of Ireland, the earliest of the Western colonial conquests. It was described in the same terms as the conquest of Africa. The Irish were a different race. They weren\u2019t human. They weren\u2019t like us. We had to crush and destroy them.","The phrase itself, the American dream, was coined in the \u201930s basically in the heart of the Depression. Much of this framing was pointed at the need to keep the economy rumbling at a great pace when World War II ended. So one of the ways in which industry could keep going was to promulgate not collective consumption, but individual consumption.","The American dream, here it is: In America (and this is not just confined to America of course), if you work hard, play by the rules, you will succeed. Work hard, play by the rules, you will succeed. That\u2019s part of the dream. Typically, it also includes a metric for what constitutes success. It almost invariably takes a commodified form, success. Since that\u2019s the kind of reward a capitalist system can and must deliver. For example, a recurrent formulation is a home of one\u2019s own.","It has to do with conquest, with oppression. If you\u2019re robbing somebody, oppressing them, dictating their lives, it\u2019s a very rare person who can say: Look, I\u2019m a monster. I\u2019m doing this for my own good. Even Himmler didn\u2019t say that. A standard technique of belief formation goes along with oppression, whether it\u2019s throwing them in gas chambers or charging them too much at a corner store, or anything in between. The standard reaction is to say: It\u2019s their depravity. That\u2019s why I\u2019m doing it. Maybe I\u2019m even doing them good. If it\u2019s their depravity, there\u2019s got to be something about them that makes them different from me. What\u2019s different about them will be whatever you can find. And that\u2019s the justification. Then it becomes racism. You can always find something\u2014they have a different color hair or eyes, they\u2019re too fat, or they\u2019re gay. You find something that\u2019s different enough. Of course you can lie about it, so it\u2019s easier to find.","You\u2019ve all read Animal Farm in school, I\u2019m sure. But it\u2019s pretty unlikely that you\u2019ve read Orwell\u2019s preface to Animal Farm, which was not published. It was discovered many years later in his collected papers. It sometimes appears in contemporary editions, but was probably missing from the book you read. You\u2019ll recall that Animal Farm is a satirical critique of Bolshevik Russia, the totalitarian enemy. But the preface, directed to the people of free England, says that they shouldn\u2019t feel too self-righteous about it. England too has literary censorship, of a kind appropriate to free societies in thrall to hegemonic common sense. \u201cThe sinister fact about literary censorship in England, Orwell wrote, \u201cis that it is largely voluntary. Unpopular ideas can be silenced, and inconvenient facts kept dark, without any need for any official ban.\u201d","the man whose life is spent in performing a few simple operations, of which the effects too are, perhaps, always the same, or very nearly the same, has no occasion to exert his understanding\u2026 and generally becomes as stupid and ignorant as it is possible for a human creature to be\u2026. But in every improved and civilized society this is the state into which the labouring poor, that is, the great body of the people, must necessarily fall, unless government takes some pains to prevent it.","In the contemporary period, Hume\'s conception has been revived and elaborated, but with a crucial innovation: the theory is that control of thought is more important for governments that are free and popular than for despotic and military states. The logic is straightforward: a despotic state can control its domestic enemy by force, but as the stare loses this weapon, other devices are required to prevent the ignorant masses from interfering with public affairs, which are none of their business. The point is, in fact, far more general. The public must be reduced to passivity in the political realm, but for submissiveness to become a reliable trait, it must be entrenched in the realm of belief as well. The public are to be observers, not participants, consumers of ideology as well as products. Eduardo Galeano writes that \\"the majority must resign itself to the consumption of fantasy. Illusions of wealth are sold to the poor, illusions of freedom to the oppressed, dreams of victory to the defeated and of power to the weak.\\" That is the essential point.","See, whether you have seditious libel is sort of at the core of whether it\'s a free society or not: if you\'re not allowed to criticize the government, if you can be punished for assaulting the government with words, even if that\'s in the background somewhere, the society is not really free. And truth is no defense to this kind of libel charge, keep in mind-in fact, traditionally truth makes the crime worse, because if what you\'re saying is true, then the undermining of state authority is even worse.","Neoliberalism is the defining political economic paradigm of our time\u2014it refers to the policies and processes whereby a relative handful of private interests are permitted to control as much as possible of social life in order to maximize their personal profit.","Take students today They are in some ways freer than they were 60 years ago in their attitudes and commitments and so on. On the other hand they are more disciplined. They are disciplined by debt. Part of the reasoning for arranging education so you come out with heavy debt is so you are disciplined. Take the last 20 years\u2014the neo-liberal years roughly\u2014a very striking part of what is called \\"globalization\\" is just aimed at discipline. It wants to eliminate freedom of choice and impose discipline. How do you do that? Well, if you\'re a couple in the U.S. now, each working 50 hours a week to put food on the table, you don\'t have time to think about how to become a libertarian socialist. When what you are worried about is \\"how can I get food on the table?\\" or \\"I\'ve got kids to take care of, and when they are sick I\'ve got to go to work and what\'s going to happen to them?\\" Those are very well-designed techniques of imposing discipline.","Classical liberalism was wrecked on the shoals of capitalism, but","From Ferguson to Athens, via Mexico, it is clear that many governments are reproducing the tools that Israel uses to repress and oppress the Palestinians. The replication of those same tactics, methods, and often weapons serves as proof that the Palestinians are now used as guinea pigs for experimentation.","If you read British Foreign Office records from the 1940s, it\u2019s clear they recognised that their day in the sun was over and that Britain would have to be the \u201cjunior partner of the United States, and sometimes treated in a humiliating way. A striking example of this was in 1962, the time of the Cuban missile crisis. The Kennedy planners were making some very dangerous choices and pursuing policies which they thought had a good chance of leading to nuclear war, and they knew that Britain would be wiped out. The US wouldn\u2019t, because Russia\u2019s missiles couldn\u2019t reach there, but Britain would be wiped out.\u201d","As long as the general population is passive, apathetic, diverted to consumerism or hatred of the vulnerable, then the powerful can do as they please, and those who survive will be left to contemplate the outcome.\u2015 Noam Chomsky\u201d","But there\'s one word. You look at any other term of political discourse, and you\'re going to find the same thing: the terms of political discourse are designed so as to prevent thought. One of the main ones is this notion of \\"defense.\\" So look at the diplomatic record of any country you want-Nazi Germany, the Soviet Union, Libya, pick your favorite horror-story-you\'ll find that everything they ever did was \\"defensive\\"; I\'m sure if we had records from Genghis Khan we would find that what he was doing was \\"defensive\\" too. And here in the United States you cannot challenge that-no matter how absurd it gets.","On almost all issues, citizens could not identify the stands of the candidates--as intended.","Unfortunately, you can\u2019t vote the rascals out, because you never voted them in, in the first place. The corporate executives and the corporation lawyers and so on who overwhelmingly staff the executive, assisted increasingly by a university based mandarin class, remain in power no matter whom you elect.","El poder es siempre ileg\xedtimo, hasta que demuestre lo contrario.","These ideas grew out of the Enlightenment; their roots are in Rousseau\u2019s Discourse on Inequality, Humboldt\u2019s Limits of State Action, Kant\u2019s insistence, in his defense of the French Revolution, that freedom is the precondition for acquiring the maturity for freedom, not a gift to be granted when such maturity is achieved. With the development of industrial capitalism, a new and unanticipated system of injustice, it is libertarian socialism that has preserved and extended the radical humanist message of the Enlightenment and the classical liberal ideals that were perverted into an ideology to sustain the emerging social order. In fact, on the very same assumptions that led classical liberalism to oppose the intervention of the state in social life, capitalist social relations are also intolerable.","It\'s amazing in Europe: Europe has become extraordinarily colonized culturally by the United States, to an extent that is almost unbelievable\u2015Europeans aren\'t aware of it apparently, but if you go there it\'s kind of like a pale United States at this point, yet they still have this feeling of great independence, so it\'s even more dramatic. I mean, Western European intellectuals like to think of themselves as very sophisticated and sort of laughing about these dumb Americans\u2015but they are so brainwashed by the United States that it\'s a joke. Their perceptions of the world and their misunderstandings and so on are all filtered through American television and movies and newspapers, but somehow by this point they just don\'t recognize it.","Neoliberalism works best when there is formal electoral democracy, but when the population is diverted from the information, access, and public forums necessary for meaningful participation in decision making.","...though of course the weak would have to be insane to implement their rights","So you have to\xa0 ask, \u201cIs it better to help the worse candidate to be elected? You can make a case for doing that. In fact, there was an old Communist Party principle back in the\xa0 early 1930s: \u201cthe worse, the better.\u201d If you get the worse candidate in, it\u2019s going to be better, because then there will be more support for a revolution.\u201d","But it was quickly recognized in the 1920s that what they called \\"on-job control\\" could be extended to \\"off-job control.\\" That is, controlling every other aspect of life in the same way. So why should people not be robots in their entire life? And to be a robot means to focus your attention on what were called the superficial things of life. Like fashionable consumption, not on care for one another, not on working together to create a decent environment, not on what the world will be like for your children. To turn you into a passive consumer, a person who pushes buttons every couple years and is taught that that is democracy. Follow orders, don\'t think. Identify your own value as a human being in the amount of useless consumption that you can carry out. That\'s \\"off-job control.\\" It runs through all the institutions and it\'s a huge industry. And, yes, to overcome off-job control you have to make people realize that your value as a human being is not how deeply you can go in debt and how many credit cards you can max out to get commodities you want. That is not your value as a human being.","So you could say that one alternative to the free market system is the one we already have, because we often don\u2019t rely on the market where powerful interests would be damaged. Our actual economic policy is a mixture of protectionist, interventionist, free-market and liberal measures. And it\u2019s directed primarily to the needs of those who implement social policy, who are mostly the wealthy and the powerful. For example, the US has always had an active state industrial policy, just like every other industrial country. It\u2019s been understood that a system of private enterprise can survive only if there is extensive government intervention. It\u2019s needed to regulate disorderly markets and protect private capital from the destructive effects of the market system, and to organize a public subsidy for targeting advanced sectors of industry, etc. But nobody called it industrial policy, because for half a century it has been masked within the Pentagon system. Internationally, the Pentagon was an intervention force, but domestically it was a method by which the government could coordinate the private economy, provide welfare to major corporations, subsidize them, arrange the flow of taxpayer money to research and development, provide a state-guaranteed market for excess production, target advanced industries for development, etc. Just about every successful and flourishing aspect of the US economy has relied on this kind of government involvement.","In the U.S. Constitution there was a category of creatures called three-fifth humans\u2014the enslaved population.

If, say, we choose to invade some defenseless country to capture one of our agents who no longer follows orders, and then try him for crimes committed while on our payroll, who could question the majesty of our system of justice? True, the UN did, but our veto took care of that childish tantrum.","Democracy functions insofar as individuals can participate meaningfully in the public arena, meanwhile running their own affairs, individually and collectively, without illegitimate interference by concentrations of power. Functioning democracy presupposes relative equality in access to resources\u2014material, informational, and other\u2014a truism as old as Aristotle. In theory, governments are instituted to serve their \u201cdomestic constituencies and are to be subject to their will. A measure of functioning democracy, then, is the extent to which the theory approximates reality, and the \u201cdomestic constituencies\u201d genuinely approximate the population.\u201d","Well, in my view what would ultimately be necessary would be a breakdown of the nation-state system\u2015because I think that\'s not a viable system. It\'s not necessarily the natural form of human organization; in fact, it\'s a European invention pretty much. The modern nation-state system basically developed in Europe since the medieval period, and it was extremely difficult for it to develop: Europe has a very bloody history, an extremely savage and bloody history, with constant massive wars and so on, and that was all part of an effort to establish the nation-state system. It has virtually no relation to the way people live, or to their associations, or anything else particularly, so it had to be established by force. And it was established by centuries of bloody warfare. That warfare ended in 1945\u2015and the only reason it ended is because the next war was going to destroy everything. So it ended in 1945\u2015we hope; if it didn\'t, it will destroy everything.","Aggression is \u201cthe supreme international crime differing only from other war crimes in that it contains within itself the accumulated evil of the whole.","Tenemos dos opciones.

It is not for the public, Lippman observes to \\"pass judgment on the intrinsic merits\\" of an issue or to offer analysis or solutions, but merely, on occasion, to place \\"its force at the disposal\\" of one or another group of \\"responsible men\\" from the specialized class. The public \\"does not reason, investigate, invent, persuade, bargain or settle.\\" Rather, \\"the public acts only by aligning itself as the partisan of someone in a position to act executively,\\" once he has given the matter at hand sober and disinterested thought. \\"The public must be put in its place,\\" so that we \\"may live free of the trampling and the roar of a bewildered herd.\\" The herd \\"has its function\\": to be \\"the interested spectators of action,\\" not the participants; that is the duty of \\"the responsible man.","Chomsky\u2019s description of the neoliberal/corporate hold over our economy, polity, journalism, and culture is so powerful and overwhelming that for some readers it can produce a sense of resignation. In our demoralized political times, a few may go a step further and conclude that we are enmeshed in this regressive system because, alas, humanity is simply incapable of creating a more humane, egalitarian, and democratic social order.","Universities face a constant struggle to maintain their integrity, and their fundamental social role in a healthy society, in the face of external pressures. The problems are heightened with the expansion of private power in every domain, in the course of the state-corporate social engineering projects of the past several decades. . . . To defend their integrity and proper commitments is an honorable and difficult task in itself, but our sights should be set higher than that. Particularly in the societies that are more privileged, many choices are available, including fundamental institutional change, if that is the right way to proceed, and surely including scholarship that contributes to, and draws from, the never-ending popular struggles for freedom and justice. 5 Higher education is under attack not because it is failing, but because it is a potentially democratic public sphere.","The powerful are self-immunized from even inquiry, let alone punishment for their crimes.","So someone can ask me what reflects my interpretation of the way things are, and I can tell them where they can get material that looks at the world the way I think it ought to be looked at-but then they have to decide whether or not that\'s accurate.

Economist Jeffrey Sachs, in a careful study, concludes that \'contrary to some commentaries, decarbonization will not require grand mobilization of the U.S. economy on par with World War II. The incremental costs of decarbonization above our normal energy costs will amount to 1 to 2 percent of U.S. GDP per year during the period to 2050. By contrast, during World War II, federal outlays soared to 43 percent of GDP from the prewar level of 10 percent of GDP in 1940.","I sometimes turn on the radio and I find very often that what I\'m listening to is a discussion of sports. These are telephone conversations. People call in and have long and intricate discussions, and it\'s plain that quite a high degree of thought and analysis is going into that. People know a tremendous amount. They know all sorts of complicated details and enter into far-reaching discussion about whether the coach made the right decision yesterday and so on. These are ordinary people, not professionals, who are applying their intelligence and analytic skills in these areas and accumulating quite a lot of knowledge and, for all I know, understanding. On the other hand, when I hear people talk about, say, international affairs or domestic problems, it\'s at a level of superficiality that\'s beyond belief.","The meaning of life is something we answer with our own activities; there\u2019s no general answer.

What is the threat of communism to this system? For a clear and cogent answer, one can turn to an extensive study of the Woodrow Wilson Foundation and National Planning Association called the Political Economy of American Foreign Policy, a very important book. It was compiled by a representative segment of the tiny elite that largely sets public policy for whoever is technically in office. In effect, it\u2019s as close as you can come to a manifesto of the American ruling class.Here they define the primary threat of communism as \u201cthe economic transformation of the communist powers in ways which reduce their willingness or ability to complement the industrial economies of the West. That is the primary threat of communism. Communism, in short, reduces the willingness and ability of underdeveloped countries to function in the world capitalist economy in the manner of, for example, the Philippines which has developed a colonial economy of a classic type, after 75 years of American tutelage and domination. It is this doctrine which explains why British economist Joan Robinson describes the American crusade against communism as a crusade against development.\u201d","If a man acts in a purely mechanical way, reacting to external demands or instruction rather than in ways determined by his own interests and energies and power, \u201cwe may admire what he does, but we despise what he is.14\u201d","During the onset of the Industrial Revolution in Eastern Massachusetts, mid-nineteenth century, there happened to be a very lively press run by working people, young women in the factories, artisans in the mills, and so on. They had their own press that was very interesting, very widely read and had a lot of support. And they bitterly condemned the way the industrial system was taking away their freedom and liberty and imposing on them rigid hierarchical structures that they didn\u2019t want. One of their main complaints was what they called \u201cthe new spirit of the age: gain wealth forgetting all but self. For 150 years there have been massive efforts to try to impose \u201cthe new spirit of the age\u201d on people.

It is not a distortion to describe them as vulgar Marxists, with values and commitments reversed.","There are various kinds of propaganda systems. There\u2019s the kind that they had in Russia in the old days, which was overt. The government said, here\u2019s what you are supposed to believe. Okay, so maybe people would accept it, maybe not, but they had no doubt as to where it was coming from. A sophisticated propaganda system won\u2019t do that. It won\u2019t state the doctrines you are supposed to believe. It will just presuppose them, so they become like the air you breathe. That\u2019s the basis for discussion. Then we have debate within those limits.","If you want to traumatize people, treason trials are an extreme way\u2014if there are spies running around in our midst, then we\u2019re really in trouble, we\u2019d better just listen to the government and stop thinking.","The kinds of things that I would say on Nightline, you can\u2019t say in one sentence because they depart from standard religion.

We have very strong reasons to believe that all possible human languages are very similar; a Martian scientist observing humans might conclude that there is just a single language, with minor variants. The reason is that the particular aspect of human nature that underlies the growth of language allows very restricted options. Is this limiting? Of course. Is it liberating? Also of course. It is these very restrictions that make it possible for a rich and intricate system of expression of thought to develop in similar ways on the basis of very rudimentary, scattered, and varied experience.","Whatever does not spring from a man\'s free choice, or is only the result of instruction and guidance, does not enter into his very being, but remains alien to his true nature; he does not perform it with truly human energies, but merely with mechanical exactness","La libertad, cuando no hay oportunidades, es un regalo envenenado; y negarse a proporcionar estas oportunidades es un acto criminal.","About half the population thinks that every person in Congress, including their own representative, should be thrown out.

Now think about it, if you\u2019re an elite and you want to govern people, which of these forms is preferable? Well, of the two, hegemony is much more desirable for the governors since governance with consent does not produce opposition and resistance by definition. If people are consenting to be governed, why would they object? Why would they resist?","My response to the end of Soviet tyranny was similar to my reaction to the defeat of Hitler and Mussolini. In all cases, it is a victory for the human spirit. It should have been particularly welcome to socialists, since a great enemy of socialism had at last collapsed. Like you, I was intrigued to see how people\u2014including people who had considered themselves anti-Stalinist and anti-Leninist\u2014were demoralized by the collapse of the tyranny. What it reveals is that they were more deeply committed to Leninism than they believed.","MAN: What do you think about nationalization of industry as a means of allowing for this kind of large-scale social planning? Well, it would depend on how it\u2019s done. If nationalization of industry puts production into the hands of a state bureaucracy or some sort of Leninist-style vanguard party, then you\u2019d just have another system of exploitation, in my view. On the other hand, if nationalization of industry was based on actual popular control over industry\u2014workers\u2019 control over factories, community control, with the groups maybe federated together and so on\u2014then that would be a different story. That would be a very different story, in fact. That would be extending the democratic system to economic power, and unless that happens, political power is always going to remain a very limited phenomenon.","So just take a look at the different prosecution rates and sentencing rules for ghetto drugs like crack and suburban drugs like cocaine, or for drunk drivers and drug users, or just between blacks and whites in general\u2015the statistics are clear: this is a war on the poor and minorities. Or ask yourself a simple question: how come marijuana is illegal but tobacco legal? It can\'t be because of the health impact, because that\'s exactly the other way around\u2015there has never been a fatality from marijuana use among million reported users in the United States, whereas tobacco kills hundreds of thousands of people every year. My strong suspicion, though I don\'t know how to prove it, is that the reason is that marijuana\'s a weed, you can grow it in your backyard, so there\'s nobody who would make any money off it if it were legal. Tobacco requires extensive capital inputs and technology, and it can be monopolized, so there are people who can make a ton of money off it. I don\'t really see any other difference between the two of them, frankly\u2015except that tobacco\'s far more lethal and far more addictive.","When you rent yourself to some concentration of capital in the private sector\u2014that\u2019s what taking a job is\u2014you\u2019re giving your life over to a dictatorship, in fact, an extreme form of dictatorship that reaches far beyond political dictatorships. The tyranny to which you are handing yourself over to has almost total control over you. It controls every minute of your working day: what you wear and are allowed to say, when you\u2019re allowed to get a bathroom break, how your hands and legs move, whether you smoke cigarettes at home. Just about everything in your life is controlled by this extreme dictatorship, which goes far beyond any totalitarian dictatorship in the degree of control it exercises.","Take Canada again: why does Canada have the health-care program it does? Up until the mid-1960s, Canada and the United States had the same capitalist health service: extremely inefficient, tons of bureaucracy, huge administrative costs, millions of people with no insurance coverage\u2015exactly what would be amplified in the United States by Clinton\'s proposals for \\"managed competition\\" [put forward in 1993].21 But in 1962 in Saskatchewan, where the N.D.P. is pretty strong and the unions are pretty strong, they managed to put through a kind of rational health-care program of the sort that every industrialized country in the world has by now, except the United States and South Africa. Well, when Saskatchewan first put through that program, the doctors and the insurance companies and the business community were all screaming\u2015but it worked so well that pretty soon all the other Provinces wanted the same thing too, and within a couple years guaranteed health care had spread over the entire country. And that happened largely because of the New Democratic Party in Canada, which does provide a kind of cover and a framework within which popular organizations like unions, and then later things like the feminist movement, have been able to get together and do things.","But for another thing, there\'s no law of nature which says that control over capital has to be in a few hands\u2015that\'s like saying that political power has to be in a few hands. Why? There wasn\'t a law that said that the king and the nobles had to run everything, and there isn\'t a law that says that corporate owners and managers have to run everything either. These are social arrangements. They developed historically, they can be changed historically","My short-term goals are to defend and even strengthen elements of state authority which, though illegitimate in fundamental ways, are critically necessary right now to impede the dedicated efforts to \\"roll back\\" the progress that has been achieved in extending democracy and human rights. State authority is now under severe attack in the more democratic societies, but not because it conflicts with the libertarian vision. Rather the opposite: because it offers (weak) protection to some aspects of that vision. Governments have a fatal flaw: unlike the private tyrannies, the institutions of state power and authority offer to the despised public an opportunity to play some role, however limited, in managing their own affairs. That defect is intolerable to the masters, who now feel, with some justification, that changes in the international economic and political order offer the prospects of creating a kind of \\"utopia for the masters,\\" with dismal prospects for most of the rest. It should be unnecessary to spell out here what I mean. The effects are all too obvious even in the rich societies, from the corridors of power to the streets, countryside, and prisons. For reasons that merit attention but that lie beyond the scope of these remarks, the rollback campaign is currently spearheaded by dominant sectors of societies in which the values under attack have been realized in some of their most advanced forms, the English-speaking world; no small irony, but no contradiction either.","it is more gratifying to bask in praise for courageously protesting the abuses of official enemies: a fine activity, but not the priority of a value-oriented intellectual who takes the responsibilities of that stance seriously.","the effects of this commitment throughout the Third World are dramatically clear: it takes only a moment\u2019s thought to realize that the areas that have been the most under U.S. control are some of the most horrible regions in the world. For instance, why is Central America such a horror-chamber? I mean, if a peasant in Guatemala woke up in Poland [i.e. under Soviet occupation], he\u2019d think he was in heaven by comparison\u2014and Guatemala\u2019s an area where we\u2019ve had a hundred years of influence. Well, that tells you something. Or look at Brazil: potentially an extremely rich country with tremendous resources, except it had the curse of being part of the Western system of subordination. So in northeast Brazil, for example, which is a rather fertile area with plenty of rich land, just it\u2019s all owned by plantations, Brazilian medical researchers now identify the population as a new species with about 40 percent the brain size of human beings, a result of generations of profound malnutrition and neglect\u2014and this may be un-remediable except after generations, because of the lingering effects of malnutrition on one\u2019s offspring. 54 Alright, that\u2019s a good example of the legacy of our commitments, and the same kind of pattern runs throughout the former Western colonies. In fact, if you look at the countries that have developed in the world, there\u2019s a little simple fact which should be obvious to anyone on five minutes\u2019 observation, but which you never find anyone saying in the United States: the countries that have developed economically are those which were not colonized by the West; every country that was colonized by the West is a total wreck.","US relations with the World Court and other international institutions have undergone a similar evolution, to which we return.","The goal of the working class is liberation from exploitation. This goal is not reached and cannot be reached by a new directing and governing class substituting itself for the bourgeoisie.

The shipment of arms to Iran through Israel didn\u2019t begin in 1985, when the congressional inquiry and the special prosecutor pick up the story. It began almost immediately after the fall of the Shah in 1979. By 1982, it was public knowledge that Israel was providing a large part of the arms for Iran\u2014you could read it on the front page of the New York Times. In February 1982, the main Israeli figures whose names later appeared in the Iran/Contra hearings appeared on BBC television [the British Broadcasting Company, Britain\u2019s national broadcasting service] and described how they had helped organize an arms flow to the Khomeini regime. In October 1982, the Israeli ambassador to the US stated publicly that Israel was sending arms to the Khomeini regime, \u201cwith the cooperation of the United States\u2026at almost the highest level. The high Israeli officials involved also gave the reasons: to establish links with elements of the military in Iran who might overthrow the regime, restoring the arrangements that prevailed under the Shah\u2014standard operating procedure. As for the Contra war, the basic facts of the illegal North-CIA operations were known by 1985 (over a year before the story broke, when a US supply plane was shot down and a US agent, Eugene Hasenfus, was captured). The media simply chose to look the other way. So what finally generated the Iran/Contra scandal? A moment came when it was just impossible to suppress it any longer. When Hasenfus was shot down in Nicaragua while flying arms to the Contras for the CIA, and the Lebanese press reported that the US National Security Adviser was handing out Bibles and chocolate cakes in Teheran, the story just couldn\u2019t be kept under wraps. After that, the connection between the two well-known stories emerged. We then move to the next phase: damage control. That\u2019s what the follow-up was about. For more on all of this, see my Fateful Triangle (1983), Turning the Tide (1985), and Culture of Terrorism (1987).\u201d","So take something that\'s been happening in recent years: devolution\u2015that is, removing authority from the federal government down to the state governments. Well, in some circumstances, that would be a democratizing move which I would be in favor of\u2015it would be a move away from central authority down to local authority. But that\'s in abstract circumstances that don\'t exist. Right now it\'ll happen because moving decision-making power down to the state level in fact means handing it over to private power. See, huge corporations can influence and dominate the federal government, but even middle-sized corporations can influence state governments and play one state\'s workforce off against another\'s by threatening to move production elsewhere unless they get better tax breaks and so on. So under the conditions of existing systems of power, devolution is very antidemocratic; under other systems of much greater equality, devolution could be highly democratic\u2015but these are questions which really can\'t be discussed in isolation from the society as it actually exists.","Here is the myth first of all. This primitive accumulation plays in political economy about the same part as original sin in theology. Its origin is supposed to be explained when it is told as an anecdote of the past. In times long gone by there were two sorts of people; one, the diligent, intelligent, and above all frugal elite. The other lazy rascals, spending their substance more in riotous living. Thus it came to pass that the former sort accumulated wealth, and the latter sort had at last nothing to sell, except their own skins. That\u2019s really what happened. From this original sin dates the poverty of the great majority, that despite all its labor has up to now nothing to sell but itself, and the wealth of the few that increases constantly although they have long ceased to work.

I mean, as long as power is narrowly concentrated, whether in the economic or the political system, you know who\'s going to benefit from the policies\u2015you don\'t have to be a genius to figure that out. That\'s why democracy would be a good thing for the general public. But of course, achieving real democracy will require that the whole system of corporate capitalism be completely dismantled\u2015because it\'s radically anti-democratic. And that can\'t be done by a stroke of the pen, you know: you have to build up alternative popular institutions, which could allow control over society\'s investment decisions to be moved into the hands of working people and communities. That\'s a long job, it requires building up an entire cultural and institutional basis for the changes, it\'s not something that\'s just going to happen on its own. There are people who have written about what such a system might look like\u2015kind of a \\"participatory economy,\\" it\'s sometimes called. But sure, that\'s the way to go, I think.","CONTROLAR EL DESEO DE DEMOCRACIA Todo eso ocurri\xf3 hace ciento cincuenta a\xf1os; en Inglaterra, antes. Se han dedicado esfuerzos enormes a inculcar el Nuevo Esp\xedritu de la \xc9poca y hay industrias fundamentales consagradas a la labor: relaciones p\xfablicas, publicidad y m\xe1rketing en general, todo lo cual suma una parte enorme del producto interior bruto. Esas industrias se aplican en lo que el gran economista pol\xedtico Thorstein Veblen llam\xf3 \xabfabricaci\xf3n de deseos\xbb.14 En palabras de los propios empresarios, la labor consiste en dirigir a la gente hacia \xabcosas superficiales\xbb de la vida, como el \xabconsumo en moda\xbb. De esa forma la gente puede atomizarse, se pueden separar unos de otros, ya que solo se busca el beneficio personal, y se aleja a las personas del peligroso esfuerzo de pensar por s\xed mismas y enfrentarse a la autoridad. Edward Bernays, uno de los fundadores de la industria moderna de las relaciones p\xfablicas, denomin\xf3 \xabingenier\xeda del consentimiento\xbb al proceso de modelar opiniones, actitudes y percepciones. Bernays era un respetado progresista, al estilo de Wilson, Roosevelt y Kennedy, igual que su coet\xe1neo, el periodista Walter Lippmann, el intelectual p\xfablico m\xe1s destacado de Estados Unidos en el siglo XX y alab\xf3 \xabla ingenier\xeda del consentimiento\xbb como \xabun nuevo arte\xbb en la pr\xe1ctica de la democracia.

And by that, I mean not only options that are objectively available, but also options that are subjectively available\u2015like, how are people allowed to think, how are they able to think? Remember, there are all kinds of ways of thinking that are cut off from us in our society\u2015not because we\'re incapable of them, but because various blockages have been developed and imposed to prevent people from thinking in those ways. That\'s what indoctrination is about in the first place, in fact\u2015and I don\'t mean somebody giving you lectures: sitcoms on television, sports that you watch, every aspect of the culture implicitly involves an expression of what a \\"proper\\" life and a \\"proper\\" set of values are, and that\'s all indoctrination. So I think what has to happen is, other options have to be opened up to people\u2015both subjectively, and in fact concretely: meaning you can do something about them without great suffering. And that\'s one of the main purposes of socialism, I think: to reach a point where people have the opportunity to decide freely for themselves what their needs are, and not just have the \\"choices\\" forced on them by some arbitrary system of power.","Well, let me just end with one last point to do with your question. One of the issues which has devastated a substantial portion of the left in recent years, and caused enormous triumphalism elsewhere, is the alleged fact that there\'s been this great battle between socialism and capitalism in the twentieth century, and in the end capitalism won and socialism lost\u2015and the reason we know that socialism lost is because the Soviet Union disintegrated. So you have big cover stories in The Nation about \\"The End of Socialism,\\" and you have socialists who all their lives considered themselves anti-Stalinist saying, \\"Yes, it\'s true, socialism has lost because Russia failed.\\" I mean, even to raise questions about this is something you\'re not supposed to do in our culture, but let\'s try it. Suppose you ask a simple question: namely, why do people like the editors at The Nation say that \\"socialism\\" failed, why don\'t they say that \\"democracy\\" failed?\u2015and the proof that \\"democracy\\" failed is, look what happened to Eastern Europe. After all, those countries also called themselves \\"democratic\\"\u2015in fact, they called themselves \\"People\'s Democracies,\\" real advanced forms of democracy. So why don\'t we conclude that \\"democracy\\" failed, not just that \\"socialism\\" failed? Well, I haven\'t seen any articles anywhere saying, \\"Look, democracy failed, let\'s forget about democracy.\\" And it\'s obvious why: the fact that they called themselves democratic doesn\'t mean that they were democratic. Pretty obvious, right? Okay, then in what sense did socialism fail? I mean, it\'s true that the Soviet Union and its satellites in Eastern Europe called themselves \\"socialist\\" \u2015but they also called themselves \\"democratic.\\" Were they socialist? Well, you can argue about what socialism is, but there are some ideas that are sort of at the core of it, like workers\' control over production, elimination of wage labor, things like that. Did those countries have any of those things? They weren\'t even a thought there. Again, in the pre-Bolshevik part of the Russian Revolution, there were socialist initiatives\u2015but they were crushed instantly after the Bolsheviks took power, like within months. In fact, just as the moves towards democracy in Russia were instantly destroyed, the moves towards socialism were equally instantly destroyed. The Bolshevik takeover was a coup\u2015and that was perfectly well understood at the time, in fact. So if you look in the mainstream of the Marxist movement, Lenin\'s takeover was regarded as counter-revolutionary; if you look at independent leftists like Bertrand Russell, it was instantly obvious to them; to the libertarian left, it was a truism.But that truism has been driven out of people\'s heads over the years, as part of a whole prolonged effort to discredit the very idea of socialism by associating it with Soviet totalitarianism. And obviously that effort has been extremely successful\u2015that\'s why people can tell themselves that socialism failed when they look at what happened to the Soviet Union, and not even see the slightest thing odd about it. And that\'s been a very valuable propaganda triumph for elites in the West\u2015because it\'s made it very easy to undercut moves towards real changes in the social system here by saying, \\"Well, that\'s socialism\u2015and look what it leads to.\\" Okay, hopefully with the fall of the Soviet Union we can at least begin to get past that barrier, and start recovering an understanding of what socialism could really stand for.","Uma das coisas que os intelectuais fazem \xe9 justamente tornar quest\xf5es inacess\xedveis, por v\xe1rias raz\xf5es de domina\xe7\xe3o e de interesse pessoal. \xc9 muito natural para os intelectuais fazerem as coisas simples parecerem dif\xedceis. \xc9 o mesmo motivo que levava a Igreja medieval a criar mist\xe9rios.

So to a classical liberal, wage labor under capitalism would have been considered totally immoral, because it frustrates the fundamental need of people to control their own work: you\'re a slave to someone else.","Small wonder that President Obama advises us to look forward, not backward\u2014a convenient doctrine for those who hold the clubs.

I have that kind of feeling about our relation to animals... Abortion\'s a similar case-there are complicated moral issues. Feminist issues were a similar case. Slavery was a similar case. I mean, some of these things seem easy now, because we\'ve solved them and there\'s a kind of shared consensus-but I think it\'s a very good thing that people are asking questions these days about, say, animal rights. I think there are serious questions there. Like, to what extent do we have a right to experiment on and torture animals? I mean, yes, you want to do animal experimentation for the prevention of diseases. But what\'s the balance, where\'s the trade-off?","When understanding fails, there is always more force in reserve. As the \\"experiments in material and human resources control\\" collapse and \\"revolutionary development\\" grinds to a halt, we simply resort more openly to the Gestapo tactics that are barely concealed behind the facade of pacification. When American cities explode, we can expect the same. The technique of \\"limited warfare\\" translates neatly into a system of domestic repression - far more humane, as will quickly be explained, than massacring those who are unwilling to wait for the inevitable victory of the war on poverty. Why should a liberal intellectual be so persuaded of the virtues of a political system of four-year dictatorship? The answer seem all to plain.","A major reason for the concentrated, almost fanatic attack on unions and organized labor is they are a democratizing force. They provide a barrier that defends workers\u2019 rights, but also popular rights generally. That interferes with the prerogatives and power of those who own and manage the society.","Reigning doctrines are often called a \\"double standard\\".The term is misleading.It is more accurate to describe them as a single standard,clear and unmistakable,the standard that Adam Smith called the \\"vile maxim of the masters of mankind: ...All for ourselves,and nothing for other people.\\" Much has changed since his day,but the vile maxim flourishes.","Lippmann was a major figure in many domains, including political theory.

But that\'s not so unusual. Let\'s look at our own history. Take the civil rights movement. There had been plenty of concern and activism about violent repression of blacks in the South, and it took a couple of students sitting in at a lunch counter to really set it off. Small acts can make a big difference when there is a background of concern, understanding, and preliminary activism.","The other day I happened to be reading a careful, interesting account of the state of British higher education. The government is a kind of market-oriented government and they came out with an official paper, a \u2018White Paper\u2019 saying that it is not the responsibility of the state to support any institution that can\u2019t survive in the market. So, if Oxford is teaching philosophy, the arts, Greek history, medieval history, and so on, and they can\u2019t sell it on the market, why should they be supported? Because life consists only of what you can sell in the market and get back, nothing else. That is a real pathology.","Fabrication of necessary illusions for social management is as old as history. But in the democratic system, the necessary illusions cannot be imposed by force. Rather they must be instilled in the public mind by more subtle means. A totalitarian state can be satisfied with lesser degrees of allegiance to required truths. It is sufficient that people obey. What they think is a secondary concern. But in a democratic political order, there\'s always the danger that an independent thought might be translated into political action. So it is important to eliminate the threat at its root.","I started with reading Chomsky and slowly became very interested in anything that had to do with Israel/Palestine.

Because soon it will be necessary to justify other confrontations, perhaps other U.S. interventions in the world, other Vietnams.But this time, these will have to be successful intervention, which don\'t slip out of control. Chile, for example. It is even possible for the press to criticize successful interventions - the Dominican Republic, Chile, etc. - as long as these criticisms don\'t exceed \\"civilized limits,\\" that is to say, as long as they don\'t serve to arouse popular movements capable of hindering these enterprises, and are not accompanied by any rational analysis of the motives of U.S. imperialism, something which is complete anathema, intolerable to liberal ideology.How is the liberal press proceeding with regard to Vietnam, that sector which supported the \\"doves\\"? By stressing the \\"stupidity\\" of the U.S. intervention; that\'s a politically neutral term. It would have been sufficient to find an \\"intelligent\\" policy. The war was thus a tragic error in which good intentions were transmuted into bad policies, because of a generation of incompetent and arrogant officials.

Their criticism is actually very convenient for the state, which is quite willing to be chided for its errors, as long as the fundamental right of forceful intervention is not brought into question....The resources of imperialist ideology are quite vast.

Diem and his brother, Ngo Dinh Nhu, were trying to negotiate a peace settlement. So the Kennedy liberals determined that they had to be thrown out. The Kennedy administration organized a coup in which the two brothers were killed and they put in their own guy, meanwhile escalating the war. Then came the assassination of President Kennedy. Contrary to a lot of mythology, Kennedy was one of the hawks in the administration to the very last minute. He did agree to proposals for withdrawal from Vietnam, because he knew the war was very unpopular there, but always with the condition of withdrawal after victory.","With a little industry and application, anyone who is willing to extricate himself from the system of shared ideology and propaganda will readily see through the modes of distortion developed by substantial segments of the intelligentsia.

In 1925, there was a mass popular vote for Paul von Hindenburg for president. He was a Prussian aristocrat, yet his supporters were petty bourgeois storekeepers, disillusioned workers, and others--in fact, demographically not unlike the Tea Party movement. And they became the mass bass for Nazism. In 1928, the Nazis still got under 3 percent of the vote. In 1933--that\'s only five years later--they were so powerful that Hindenburg had to appoint Adolf Hitler as chancellor.","North Korea may be the craziest country in the world. It\u2019s certainly a good competitor for that title. But it does make sense to try to figure out what\u2019s in the minds of people when they\u2019re acting in crazy ways. Why would they behave the way they do? Just imagine ourselves in their situation. Imagine what it meant in the Korean War years of the early 1950s for your country to be totally leveled, everything destroyed by a huge superpower, which furthermore was gloating about what it was doing. Imagine the imprint that would leave behind.Bear in mind that the North Korean leadership is likely to have read the public military journals of this superpower at that time explaining that, since everything else in North Korea had been destroyed, the air force was sent to destroy North Korea\u2019s dams, huge dams that controlled the water supply -- a war crime, by the way, for which people were hanged in Nuremberg. And these official journals were talking excitedly about how wonderful it was to see the water pouring down, digging out the valleys, and the Asians scurrying around trying to survive. The journals were exulting in what this meant to those \u201cAsians, horrors beyond our imagination. It meant the destruction of their rice crop, which in turn meant starvation and death. How magnificent! It\u2019s not in our memory, but it\u2019s in their memory.\u201d","Representative democracy, as in, say, the United States or Great Britain, would be criticized by an anarchist of this school on two grounds. First of all because there is a monopoly of power centralized in the State, and secondly and critically\u2014because representative democracy is limited to the political sphere and in no serious way encroaches on the economic sphere. Anarchists of this tradition have always held that democratic control of one\'s productive life is at the core of any serious human liberation, or, for that matter, of any significant democratic practice. That is, as long as individuals are compelled to rent themselves on the market to those who are willing to hire them, as long as their role in production is simply that of ancillary tools, then there are striking elements of coercion and oppression that make talk of democracy very limited, if even meaningful.","For example, the difference between Pierre believes he is intelligent and He believes Pierre is intelligent is due to what are called relations of \u201ccommand: co-reference is impossible if the pronoun is located \u201chigher\u201d in the phrase structure than its nonpronominal antecedent.

Though in fact if you look at the roots of it, you discover that it was based on some three generations of experiment and thought and work which extended anarchist ideas to very large parts of the population in this largely pre-industrial\u2014though not totally pre-industrial\u2014society. And that again was, by both human measures and indeed anyone\'s economic measures, quite successful. That is, production continued effectively; workers in farms and factories proved quite capable of managing their affairs without coercion from above, contrary to what lots of socialists, communists, liberals and others wanted to believe, and in fact you can\'t tell what would have happened. That anarchist revolution was simply destroyed by force, but during the period in which it was alive I think it was a highly successful and, as I say, in many ways a very inspiring testimony to the ability of poor working people to organize and manage their own affairs, extremely successfully, without coercion and control. How relevant the Spanish experience is to an advanced industrial society. one might question in detail.","But the imperial mentality is so deeply embedded in Western culture that this travesty passes without criticism, even notice.","But the point is, if things ever really come to a crunch in the United States, this massive part of the population\u2014I think it\u2019s something like a third of the adult population by now\u2014could be the basis for some kind of a fascist movement, readily.

These attacks aroused great admiration here; for example, when he denounced Idi Amin of Uganda as a \\"racist murderer.\\" The question is not whether Idi Amin is a racist murderer. No doubt the appellation is correct. The question is, what does it mean for Moynihan to make this accusation and for others to applaud his honesty and courage in doing so? Who is Moynihan? He served in four administrations, those of Kennedy, Johnson, Nixon, and Ford - that is to say, administrations that were guilty of racist murder on a scale undreamed of by Idi Amin. Imagine that some minor functionary of the Third Reich had correctly accused someone of being a racist murderer.","scientists contribute to writing and reviewing the IPCC\u2019s reports, which are then reviewed by governments. I myself know well the climate scientists at my own university, University of Massachusetts Amherst, who are involved in various IPCC projects. These are very committed, capable, and credible people. So it is fair to say that the IPCC does bring together current, high-quality assessments of mainstream climate science on any given set of questions. There remains a small band of climate deniers, whose positions are given credence and then amplified in the mainstream media far beyond what is warranted given the scientific findings they have produced.24 Nevertheless, while it is implausible, we cannot totally rule out the possibility that some of their positions may have merit. But, exactly to this point, it is also the case that the IPCC is scrupulous in recognizing a high degree of uncertainty in all of its estimates. For example, its targets for the needed level of emissions reductions are never presented as a single figure, as in, say, \u201cwe must reduce emissions by 80 percent within twenty years or face these certain terrible consequences. Rather, the IPCC always presents its conclusions in terms of ranges and probabilities. It is also true that the IPCC has regularly changed its assessments to a significant degree, as illustrated in recent years by some of its most important publications. Thus, in its 2007 Fourth Assessment Report, the IPCC concluded that in order to stabilize the global average (mean) temperature\u201d","The selection of issues that should rank high on the agenda of concern for human welfare and rights is, naturally, a subjective matter. But there are a few choices that seems unavoidable, because they bear so directly on the prospects for decent survival.

European governments do see primarily to the needs of private wealth, but they also have created a not insubstantial safety net for the rest of the population. They have general health care, reasonable services, etc. We haven\u2019t had that, in part because we don\u2019t have the same organised work force, and we have a much more class-conscious and dominant business community.","Madison foresaw that the threat of democracy was likely to become more severe over time because of the increase in \\"the proportion of those who will labor under all the hardships of life and secretly sigh for a more equal distribution of its blessings.\\" They might gain influence, Madison feared.

His solution was to keep political power in the hands of those who \\"come from and represent the wealth of the nation,\\" the \\"more capable set of men,\\" with the general public fragmented and disorganized.","Private power doesn\'t like public education, for many reasons. One is the principle upon which it\'s based, which is threatening to power. Public education is based on a principle of solidarity. So, for example, I had my children fifty years ago. Nevertheless, I feel and I\'m supposed to feel that I should pay taxes so the kids across the street can go to school. That\'s counter to the doctrine that you should just look after yourself and let everyone else fall by the wayside, a basic principle of business rule. Public education is a threat to that belief system because it builds up a sense of solidarity, community, mutual support.","Man: Don\'t these precedents suggest that there is something inherently pre-industrial about the applicability of libertarian ideas\u2014that they necessarily presuppose a rather rural society in which technology and production are fairly simple, and in which the economic organization tends to be small-scale and localized?Well, let me separate that into two questions: one, how anarchists have felt about it, and two, what I think is the case. As far as anarchist reactions are concerned, there are two. There has been one anarchist tradition\u2014and one might think, say, of Kropotkin as a representative\u2014which had much of the character you describe. On the other hand there\'s another anarchist tradition that develops into anarcho-syndicalism which simply regarded anarchist ideas as the proper mode of organization for a highly complex advanced industrial society. And that tendency in anarchism merges, or at least inter-relates very closely with a variety of left-wing Marxism, the kind that one finds in, say, the Council Communists that grew up in the Luxemburgian tradition, and that is later represented by Marxist theorists like Anton Pannekoek, who developed a whole theory of workers\' councils in industry and who is himself a scientist and astronomer, very much part of the industrial world. So which of these two views is correct? I mean, is it necessary that anarchist concepts belong to the pre-industrial phase of human society, or is anarchism the rational mode of organization for a highly advanced industrial society? Well, I myself believe the latter, that is, I think that industrialization and the advance of technology raise possibilities for self-management over a broad scale that simply didn\'t exist in an earlier period. And that in fact this is precisely the rational mode for an advanced and complex industrial society, one in which workers can very well become masters of their own immediate affairs, that is, in direction and control of the shop, but also can be in a position to make the major substantive decisions concerning the structure of the economy, concerning social institutions, concerning planning regionally and beyond. At present, institutions do not permit them to have control over the requisite information, and the relevant training to understand these matters. A good deal could be automated. Much of the necessary work that is required to keep a decent level of social life going can be consigned to machines\u2014at least in principle\u2014which means humans can be free to undertake the kind of creative work which may not have been possible, objectively, in the early stages of the industrial revolution.","a system of governance that merely grants the general public the opportunity to ratify decisions taken by the elite groups that dominate the private society and the state, hardly merits the term \u201cdemocracy.","Procurar-se-\xe1 em v\xe3o na Carta das Na\xe7\xf5es Unidas o fundamento da autoridade reclamada por Washington para usar a for\xe7a e a viol\xeancia com vistas \xe0 consecu\xe7\xe3o do \u201cinteresse nacional, tal como definido pelas pessoas imortais que lan\xe7am sobre a sociedade essa sombra chamada \u201cpol\xedtica\u201d, na evocativa frase de John Dewey.

In the early \u201950s they were threatened by a new reformist democracy in Guatemala, which overthrew the dictatorship and intended to take unused lands owned by the fruit company and distribute them to poor peasants, along with other reforms. Bernays was hired to do something about that. He developed a very successful propaganda campaign to engineer consent among the American public for a military coup, the 1953 military coup, which ended these heresies and protected the power of the Fruit Company under the new military dictatorship","the masters represent \u201cthe national interest, like those who applauded themselves for leading the country to war \u201cafter the utmost deliberation by the more thoughtful members of the community\u201d had reached its \u201cmoral verdict.\u201d","We will also learn that our own actions, or passive acquiescence, contribute quite substantially to misery and oppression, and perhaps eventual global destruction.","Over 90% of the water in Gaza has been deemed unfit for human consumption this was made worse when Israel attacked water sewage systems\ufffc\ufffc.A Large population of Palestinian children are affected by the man-made man nourishment regime caused by that is really imposed a blockage.

He informed the world of science that leaders, with the aid of technicians in the field who have specialized in utilizing the channels of communication, have been able to accomplish purposefully and scientifically what we have termed \u2018the engineering of consent.\u2019 This phrase quite simply means the use of an engineering approach\u2014that is, action based on thorough knowledge of the situation and on the application of scientific principles and tried practices to the task of getting people to support ideas and programs\u2026. The engineering of consent is the very essence of the democratic process, the freedom to persuade and suggest\u2026. A leader frequently cannot wait for the people to arrive at even general understanding \u2026 democratic leaders must play their part in \u2026 engineering consent to socially constructive goals and values\u2026. The responsible leader, to accomplish social objectives, must therefore be constantly aware of the possibilities of subversion. He must apply his energies to mastering the operational know-how of consent engineering, and to out-maneuvering his opponents in the public interest (Bernays, 1947).","La industria de las \xablas relaciones p\xfablicas\xbb consist\xeda en controlar la opini\xf3n p\xfablica.","The need to humiliate those who raise their heads is an ineradicable element of the imperial mentality.

The leading dove was undoubtedly George Kennan, who headed the State Department planning staff until 1950, when he was replaced by Nitze\u2014Kennan\u2019s office, incidentally, was responsible for the Gehlen network. Kennan was one of the most intelligent and lucid of US planners, and a major figure in shaping the postwar world. His writings are an extremely interesting illustration of the dovish position. One document to look at if you want to understand your country is Policy Planning Study 23, written by Kennan for the State Department planning staff in 1948.

The day is not far off when we are going to have to deal in straight power concepts. The less we are then hampered by idealistic slogans, the better. PPS 23 was, of course, a top-secret document.

So what\'s left? Well, one thing that\'s left is sports\u2015so you put a lot of the intelligence and the thought and the self-confidence into that. And I suppose that\'s also one of the basic functions it serves in the society in general: it occupies the population, and keeps them from trying to get involved with things that really matter. In fact, I presume that\'s part of the reason why spectator sports are supported to the degree they are by the dominant institutions.","Oggi come ieri, non c\u2019\xe8 motivo di pensare che siamo governati da leggi misteriose e sconosciute, anzich\xe9 da semplici decisioni prese all\u2019interno di istituzioni che sono soggette alla volont\xe0 umana, istituzioni umane, che devono dimostrare la propria legittimit\xe0 e se non superano l\u2019esame possono essere sostituite da altre pi\xf9 libere e pi\xf9 giuste, com\u2019\xe8 accaduto spesso in passato.","It is no easy task to gain some understanding of human affairs.

Do you think that those two terms Libertarian Socialism and Anarchism\u2014are synonymous or do you think there are real differences between the two? Well, I don\'t think we can really say, because the terms of political discourse aren\'t well defined. Capitalism, trade, the state, pick any one... they are pretty loose terms. Which is okay, but it doesn\'t make sense to try to define these terms carefully when you don\'t have an explanatory theory to embed them in. But the fact is we can\'t really answer the question, anarchism covers too many things, libertarian socialism covers too many things. But I sympathize with what he\'s trying to do. I think it\'s the right thing. If you look carefully they are really close, there are similarities and relationships. The more anti-statist, antivanguardist left elements of the socialist movement, Marxist movement in fact\u2014folks like Anton Pannekoek and others\u2014there are close similarities between them and some of the wings of the anarchist movement, like the anarcho-syndicalists. It\'s pretty hard to make much of a distinction between, say, Pannekoek\'s workers\' councils and anarcho-syndicalist conceptions of how to organize society. There are some differences, but they are the kind of differences that ought to exist when people are working together in comradely relationships. So, yes, that\'s a sensible blend in my view. The much sharper distinction is between all these movements and the various forms of totalitarianism like Bolshevism, corporate capitalism and so on. There you have a real break. Totalitarian structures on the one hand and free societies on the other. In fact, 1 think there are significant similarities between libertarian socialism and anarchism, this blend, and even very mainstream thinkers like John Dewey\u2014there are striking similarities.","If capital is privately controlled, then people are going to have to run tonsils in order to survive.

The first point was the invasion and counterrevolution of 1954, which reintroduced political murder and large-scale repression to Guatemala following the decade of democracy. The second followed the emergence of a small guerrilla movement in the early 1960s, when the United States began serious counterinsurgency (CI) training of the Guatemalan army. In 1966, a further small guerrilla movement brought the Green Berets and a major CI war in which 10,000 people were killed in pursuit of three or four hundred guerrillas.

The purpose of the quick military build-up was to ward off the danger that Iraq might be forced out of Kuwait by peaceful means. Why was a diplomatic resolution so unattractive? Within a few weeks after the invasion of Kuwait on August 2, the basic outlines for a possible political settlement were becoming clear. Security Council Resolution 660, calling for Iraq\u2019s withdrawal from Kuwait, also called for simultaneous negotiations of border issues. By mid-August, the National Security Council considered an Iraqi proposal to withdraw from Kuwait in that context. There appear to have been two issues: first, Iraqi access to the Gulf, which would have entailed a lease or other control over two uninhabited mudflats assigned to Kuwait by Britain in its imperial settlement (which had left Iraq virtually landlocked); second, resolution of a dispute over an oil field that extended two miles into Kuwait over an unsettled border. The US flatly rejected the proposal, or any negotiations. On August 22, without revealing these facts about the Iraqi initiative (which it apparently knew), the New York Times reported that the Bush administration was determined to block the \u201cdiplomatic track for fear that it might \u201cdefuse the crisis\u201d in very much this manner.

Well, there are a lot of things, it\u2019s served a number of crucial functions. Remember, any state, any state, has a primary enemy: its own population. If politics begins to break out inside your own country and the population starts getting active, all kinds of horrible things can happen\u2014so you have to keep the population quiescent and obedient and passive. And international conflict is one of the best ways of doing it: if there\u2019s a big enemy around, people will abandon their rights, because you\u2019ve got to survive.

In the offer, Iraq proposed to destroy all such chemical and biological weapons, if other countries in the region also destroyed their weapons of mass destruction. Saddam Hussein was then Bush\u2019s friend and ally, so he received a response, which was instructive. Washington said it welcomed Iraq\u2019s proposal to destroy its own weapons, but didn\u2019t want this linked to \u201cother issues or weapons systems. There was no mention of the \u201cother weapons systems,\u201d and there\u2019s a reason for that.

Indeed, many commentators dismiss anarchism as utopian, formless, primitive, or otherwise incompatible with the realities of a complex society. One might, however, argue rather differently: that at every stage of history our concern must be to dismantle those forms of authority and oppression that survive from an era when they might have been justified in terms of the need for security or survival or economic development, but that now contribute to\u2014rather than alleviate\u2014material and cultural deficit. If so, there will be no doctrine of social change fixed for the present and future, nor even, necessarily, a specific and unchanging concept of the goals towards which social change should tend.

For the anarchist, freedom is not an abstract philosophical concept, but the vital concrete possibility for every human being to bring to full development all the powers, capacities, and talents with which nature has endowed him, and turn them to social account. The less this natural development of man is influenced by ecclesiastical or political guardianship, the more efficient and harmonious will human personality become, the more will it become the measure of the intellectual culture of the society in which it has grown.","It is true that they are less inflamed than formerly by political passions properly speaking; but do you not see that their passions, far from being political, have become social?

M, money, C, input commodities, one cycle; M prime, more money. What happens in this process to allow M to become M prime, which is the whole point? You wouldn\u2019t go through all of this if you ended up at the end with the same money as you started out with at the beginning. M just came out as M. The whole point is to get from M to M prime. To understand this, we have to examine this peculiar commodity of labor power. As an analysis of how more money emerges from the production process than goes in, Marx first rules out any possibilities of cheating or unfairness. In his analysis of the capitalist system, Marx is in a conversation with, and often in argumentation with, the economists, and political economists who came before them, principally the classical political economists. People like David Ricardo, Adam Smith, and a number of others. He wanted to make his analysis within their frame of rules, which presents capital in its best light. So that if in fact he shows it not to produce the advantages that they claim, he will have done it on their terms. One of the things he does is to rule out things like cheating, like buying low and selling high, which is a sort of principal character of mercantilism. The reason he rules this out is, he says, that on balance in society, this doesn\u2019t produce any additional surplus value or wealth. It simply redistributes what value or wealth already exists. That it all averages out; if you cheat somebody, you may have gotten something, but they lost something. It\u2019s a kind of zero-sum thing. He rules that out. Everything in the process as Marx analyzes it trades at its true value. The means of production cannot be the source of the additional value. Remember, he\u2019s trying to figure out in his process how we get from M to M prime. One of the things that capitalists do is buy means of production. He says, those cannot be the source of additional value. The reasons are this. They either transfer part of their value to the new products, or, for example, you depreciate machinery over time. You can calculate how much of the value goes into a production in each cycle of production. Or the means of production actually end up incorporated into the new product itself, but there is no new value there. So, if you make something, if you make bread out of wheat, it becomes incorporated in the bread, but there is no new value there. It\u2019s necessary for the capitalists to find on the market the commodity that produces more value than it itself costs. That\u2019s the trick. This unique commodity is labor power, and is the only element in the process that produces surplus value, which is the source of profit.","...August 6, 1945, the first day of the countdown to what may be the inglorious end of this strange species, which attained the intelligence to discover the effective means to destroy itself, but \u2014 so the evidence suggests \u2014 not the moral and intellectual capacity to control its worst instincts","Thomas Jefferson in a letter to William Short, January 8, 1825 Men, according to their constitutions, and the circumstances in which they are placed, differ honestly in opinion.

In fact, as I\'ve tried to show they contrast sharply with Marxist-Leninist doctrine and practice, the \\"libertarian\\" doctrines that are fashionable in the U.S. and UK particularly, and other contemporary ideologies, all of which seem to me to reduce to advocacy of one or another form of illegitimate authority, quite often real tyranny.","The invasion was undertaken with the expectation that it probably would increase the threat of terror.

For one thing, because it offers people something to pay attention to that is of no importance. That keeps them from worrying about things that matter to their lives that they might have some idea about doing something about. And in fact, it\u2019s striking to see the intelligence that\u2019s used by ordinary people in sports. You listen to radio sations where people call in. They have the most exotic information and understanding of all kinds of arcane issues, and the press undoubtedly does a lot with this.

Approximately one hundred shots were fired. At first the police claimed that they had responded to the fire of the Panthers, but it was quickly established by the local press that this was false. Fred Hampton, one of the most talented and promising leaders of the Panthers, was killed in his bed. There is evidence that he may have been drugged.

In fact that is just what the intelligentsia would often like us to think: they pretend to be engaged in an esoteric enterprise, inaccessible to simple people. But that\u2019s nonsense. The social sciences generally, and above all the analysis of contemporary affairs, are quite accessible to anyone who wants to take an interest in these matters. The alleged complexity, depth, and obscurity of these questions is part of the illusion propagated by the system of ideological control, which aims to make the issues seem remote from the general population and to persuade them of their incapacity to organize their own affairs or to understand the social world in which they live without the tutelage of intermediaries.","It is important to bear in mind that the Republicans long ago abandoned the pretense of functioning as a normal parliamentary party. They have, as respected conservative political commentator Norman Ornstein of the right-wing American Enterprise Institute observed, become a \u201cradical insurgency that scarcely seeks to participate in normal congressional politics.6 Since the days of President Ronald Reagan, the party leadership has plunged so far into the pockets of the very rich and the corporate sector that they can attract votes only by mobilizing parts of the population that have not previously been an organized political force. Among them are extremist evangelical Christians, now probably a majority of Republican voters; remnants of the former slaveholding states; nativists who are terrified that \u201cthey\u201d are taking our white, Christian, Anglo-Saxon country away from us; and others who turn the Republican primaries into spectacles remote from the mainstream of modern society\u2014though not from the mainstream of the most powerful country in world history.\u201d","At the deepest level, the media contribute to the sense that the government is the enemy, and they suppress the sources of real power in the society, which lie in the totalitarian institutions\u2014the corporations, now international in scale\u2014that control the economy and much of our social life. In fact, the corporations set the conditions within which the government operates, and control it to a large extent. The picture presented in the media is constant, day after day. People simply have no awareness of the system of power under which they\u2019re suffering. As a result\u2014as intended\u2014they turn their attention against the government.","Syntactic Structures and LSLT.","If you go back to a century ago, the major problems of electrical and mechanical engineering had to do with how to place a huge gun on a moving platform, namely a ship, designing it to be able to hit a moving object, another ship, so naval gunnery.

Out of associated innovations comes the automotive industry.","And it may be that history, as Michel Foucault tried to convince us, is a list of discrete, disconnected processes whose joint impact is not linked to any one of them but to their fusion into one big explosion. In that case, history is not just a linear movement of endless American support for Israel against, and at the expense of, the Palestinian cause but a more distorted, curved line of ups and downs that indicate possible changes in the future. Moreover, a concerted effort to bring about such a change is a worthy goal\u2014inside and outside the United States.

But right now it runs directly counter to my goals: my immediate goals have been, and now very much are, to defend and even strengthen certain elements of state authority that are now under severe attack. And I don\'t think there\'s any contradiction there\u2015none at all, really. For example, take the so-called \\"welfare state.\\" What\'s called the \\"welfare state\\" is essentially a recognition that every child has a right to have food, and to have health care and so on\u2015and as I\'ve been saying, those programs were set up in the nation-state system after a century of very hard struggle, by the labor movement, and the socialist movement, and so on. Well, according to the new spirit of the age, in the case of a fourteen-year-old girl who got raped and has a child, her child has to learn \\"personal responsibility\\" by not accepting state welfare handouts, meaning, by not having enough to eat. Alright, I don\'t agree with that at any level. In fact, I think it\'s grotesque at any level. I think those children should be saved. And in today\'s world, that\'s going to have to involve working through the state system; it\'s not the only case. So despite the anarchist \\"vision,\\" I think aspects of the state system, like the one that makes sure children eat, have to be defended\u2015in fact, defended very vigorously. And given the accelerating effort that\'s being made these days to roll back the victories for justice and human rights which have been won through long and often extremely bitter struggles in the West, in my opinion the immediate goal of even committed anarchists should be to defend some state institutions, while helping to pry them open to more meaningful public participation, and ultimately to dismantle them in a much more free society. There are practical problems of tomorrow on which people\'s lives very much depend, and while defending these kinds of programs is by no means the ultimate end we should be pursuing, in my view we still have to face the problems that are right on the horizon, and which seriously affect human lives. I don\'t think those things can simply be forgotten because they might not fit within some radical slogan that reflects a deeper vision of a future society. The deeper visions should be maintained, they\'re important\u2015but dismantling the state system is a goal that\'s a lot farther away, and you want to deal first with what\'s at hand and nearby, I think. And in any realistic perspective, the political system, with all its flaws, does have opportunities for participation by the general population which other existing institutions, such as corporations, don\'t have. In fact, that\'s exactly why the far right wants to weaken governmental structures\u2015because if you can make sure that all the key decisions are in the hands of Microsoft and General Electric and Raytheon, then you don\'t have to worry anymore about the threat of popular involvement in policy-making.","The Allies, interestingly enough, toward the end of World War II, delayed opening a second front in Europe to aid the Soviets, who were fighting the Germans on the Eastern front. The Allies didn\u2019t really move heavily in that direction. This inaction may have been a deliberate strategy to weaken Stalin. But one consequence of the delay was that it allowed the Soviets to accumulate and then to keep territory in Eastern Europe, and this becomes very, very important in the postwar, and subsequent Cold War, period.","siquiera son acuerdos comerciales, sino, b\xe1sicamente, acuerdos de derechos de inversores.","Over the following years, the concept of \u201cperson was changed by the courts in two ways.

So the management of corporations became \u201cpersons.\u201d It was also narrowed to exclude undocumented immigrants. They had to be excluded from the category of \u201cpersons.\u201d And that\u2019s happening right now. So the legislations that you\u2019re talking about, they go two ways. They broaden the category of persons to include corporate entities, which now have rights way beyond human beings, given by the trade agreements and others, and they exclude the people who flee from Central America where the U.S. devastated their homelands, and flee from Mexico because they can\u2019t compete with the highly-subsidized U.S. agribusiness.\u201d","The most influential of the Framers, James Madison, captured the dominant theme when he instructed the Convention that the government must \u201cprotect the minority of the opulent against the majority.","Such facts cannot be perceived within educated circles if they hope to retain respectability.","The hideous revelations elicited a different reaction from the Most Moral President in the World, the usual one: great sympathy for Israelis, bitter condemnation of Hamas, and calls for moderation on both sides.

Since its origins, the Soviet State has attempted to harness the energies of its own population and oppressed people elsewhere in the service of the men who took advantage of the popular ferment in Russia in 1917 to seize State power. One major ideological weapon employed to this end has been the claim that the State managers are leading their own society and the world towards the socialist ideal; an impossibility, as any socialist \u2014 surely any serious Marxist \u2014 should have understood at once (many did), and a lie of mammoth proportions as history has revealed since the earliest days of the Bolshevik regime. The taskmasters have attempted to gain legitimacy and support by exploiting the aura of socialist ideals and the respect that is rightly accorded them, to conceal their own ritual practice as they destroyed every vestige of socialism.As for the world\u2019s second major propaganda system, association of socialism with the Soviet Union and its clients serves as a powerful ideological weapon to enforce conformity and obedience to the State capitalist institutions, to ensure that the necessity to rent oneself to the owners and managers of these institutions will be regarded as virtually a natural law, the only alternative to the \u2018socialist\u2019 dungeon.","Recall Bernard Fall\u2019s estimate that by April 1965, before the first North Vietnamese battalion was detected in the South, more than 160,000 \u201cViet Cong had fallen \u201cunder the crushing weight of American armor, napalm, jet bombers and, finally, vomiting gases.\u201d","One choice is to assume the worst, and then you can be guaranteed that it\'ll happen.

This is because neoliberalism is a variant of classic liberalism, and classical liberalism builds from the idea that everyone should be granted maximum freedom to pursue their self-interest within capitalist market settings. But neoliberalism also diverges substantially from classical liberalism, and therefore also from the basic premises of orthodox economics that free markets, left to their own devices, will produce outcomes that are superior to government interventions. Here is the problem with neoliberalism, when counterposed against a purely free market model celebrated by economic orthodoxy. That is, what really occurs in practice under neoliberalism is that governments allow giant corporations to freely pursue profit opportunities to the maximum extent. But then government fixers arrive on the scene to bail out the corporations whenever their profits might be threatened. This amounts to socialism for capitalists, and harsh, free market capitalism for everyone else.","Eight months [after 9/11], after the most intensive international investigation in history, the head of the Federal Bureau of Investigation informed the press that they still didn\'t know who did it. He said they had suspicions. The suspicions were that the plot was hatched in Afghanistan but implemented in Germany and the United Arab Emirates, and, of course, in the United States.After 9/11, Bush II essentially ordered the Taliban to hand over Osama bin Laden, and they temporized. They might have handed him over, actually. They asked for evidence that he was involved in the attacks of 9/11. And, of course, the government, first of all, couldn\'t given them any evidence because they didn\'t have any. But secondly, they reacted with total contempt. How can you ask us for evidence if we want you to hand somebody over? What l\xe8se-majest\xe9 is this? So Bush simply informed the people of Afghanistan that we\'re going to bomb you until the Taliban hand over Osama bin Laden. He said nothing about overthrowing the Taliban. That came three weeks later, when British admiral Michael Boyce, the head of the British Defense Staff, announced to the Afghans that we\'re going to continue bombing you until you overthrow your government. This fits the definition of terrorism exactly, but it\'s much worse. It\'s aggression.How did the Afghans feel about it? We actually don\'t know. There were leading Afghan anti-Taliban activists who were bitterly opposed to the bombing. In fact, a couple of weeks after the bombing started, the U.S. favorite, Abdul Haq, considered a great martyr in Afghanistan, was interviewed about this. He said that the Americans are carrying out the bombing only because they want to show their muscle. They\'re undermining our efforts to overthrow the Taliban from within, which we can do. If, instead of killing innocent Afghans, they help us, that\'s what will happen. Soon after that, there was a meeting in Peshawar in Pakistan of a thousand tribal leaders, some from Afghanistan who trekked across the border, some from Pakistan. They disagreed on a lot of things, but they were unanimous on one thing: stop the bombing. That was after about a month. Could the Taliban have been overthrown from within? It\'s very likely. There were strong anti-Taliban forces. But the United States didn\'t want that. It wanted to invade and conquer Afghanistan and impose its own rule....There are geostrategic reasons. They\'re not small. How dominant they are in the thinking of planners we can only speculate. But there is a reason why everybody has been invading Afghanistan since Alexander the Great. The country is in a highly strategic position relative to Central Asian, South Asia, and the Middle East. There are specific reasons in the present case having to do with pipeline projects, which are in the background. We don\'t know how important these considerations are, but since the 1990s the United States has been trying hard to establish the Trans-Afghanistan Pipeline (TAPI)from Turkmenistan, which has a huge amount of natural gas, to India. It has to go through Kandahar, in fact. So Turkmenistan, Afghanistan, Pakistan, and India are all involved.The United States wants the pipeline for two reasons. One reason is to try to prevent Russia from having control of natural gas. That\'s the new \\"great game\\": Who controls Central Asian resources? The other reason has to do with isolating Iran. The natural way to get the energy resources India needs is from Iran, a pipeline right from Iran to Pakistan to India. The United States wants to block this from happening in the worst way. It\'s a complicated business. Pakistan has just agreed to let the pipeline run from Iran to Pakistan. The question is whether India will try to join in. The TAPI pipeline would be a good weapon to try to undercut that.","It is, indeed, virtual dogma that the function of language is communication.","The struggle against slavery went on forever, the struggle for women\'s rights has been going on for centuries, the effort to overcome\\"wage slavery\\"\u2014that\'s been going on since the beginnings of the industrial revolution, we haven\'t advanced an inch.

As the Marxist theoretician Anton Pannekoek observed, \u201cthis goal is not reached and cannot be reached by a new directing and governing class substituting itself for the bourgeoisie, but can only be \u201crealized by the workers themselves being master over production.\u201d Mastery over production by the producers is the essence of socialism, and means to achieve this end have regularly been devised in periods of revolutionary struggle, against the bitter opposition of the traditional ruling classes and the \u2018revolutionary intellectuals\u2019 guided by the common principles of Leninism and Western managerialism, as adapted to changing circumstances. But the essential element of the socialist ideal remains: to convert the means of production into the property of freely associated producers and thus the social property of people who have liberated themselves from exploitation by their master, as a fundamental step towards a broader realm of human freedom.\u201d","[T]hey attribute to men a natural inclination to servitude,\xa0\u2026\xa0without thinking that it is the same for freedom as for innocence and virtue\u2014their value is felt only as long as one enjoys them oneself and the taste for them is lost as soon as one has lost them.","That\'s one of the reasons why, say, Canada, a very similar country, has a health care system and we don\'t. In Canada, the unions struggled for health care for the country. In the United States, they struggled for health care for themselves. So if you\'re an autoworker here in the United States, you had a pretty god health care and pension system. Union workers won health care for themselves in a compact with the corporations. They thought it was a deal. What they couldn\'t see was that it\'s a suicide pact. If the corporation decides the compact is over, then it\'s over. Meanwhile, the rest of the country didn\'t get health care. So now the United States has a completely dysfunctional health care system, while Canada has one that more or less works. That\'s a relation of different cultural values and institutional structures in two very similar countries. So yes, the working class did continue to develop and grow here, but with class collaboration, that is, in a compact with the corporations.","The World Bank has its own term for the phenomenon: they call it \\"technocratic insulation.\\" So if you read World Bank studies, they talk about the importance of having \\"technocratic insulation\\"\u2015meaning a bunch of technocrats,who are essentially employees of the big transnational corporations, have to be working somewhere in \\"insulation\\" from the public to design all the policies, because if the public ever gets involved in the process they may have bad ideas, like wanting the kind of economic growth that does things for people instead of profits, all sorts of stupid stuff like that. So therefore what you want to have is insulated technocrats\u2014and once they\'re insulated enough, then you can have all the \\"democracy\\" you like, since it\'s not going to make any difference.

One dream of anarchism\u2014and the only kind that survived\u2014was ultra-right anarchism, which you see in the libertarian parry, which is just loved by the big corporations and the investment firms and so on. Not that they believe in it. They know perfectly well that they\'ll never get rid of the state because they need it for their own purposes, but they love to use this as an ideological weapon against everyone else. So the libertarian parry is very warmly accepted within mainstream business circles who really ridicule it privately because they know perfectly well that they\'re not going to survive without a massive state subsidy, so they want a powerful state. But they like the libertarian ideology which they can use as a battering ram against everyone else. If you actually pursued the ideals of the libertarian party you would create the worst totalitarian monster that the world has ever seen. Actually, I have lots of personal friends there. For years, the only journals I could write in were ultra-right libertarian journals because we agree on a lot of things. For example, we agree on the opposition to American imperialism. For example, nobody would publish the first article that I was able to write on East Timor. They published it, back in the late seventies. That\'s the only article that appeared in the United States on the subject in the seventies. They also published many other things and we remained personal friends. Although there is a big area of difference.","In the early eighties, the atrocities amounted to virtual genocide in the Mayan highlands of Guatemala under a killer later sentenced for genocide. While it was underway, he was lauded by Reagan as a fine man, \u201ctotally dedicated to democracy and given a \u201cbum rap\u201d by human rights organizations. People are still fleeing from that bitter legacy. The decade of the eighties began with the assassination of the archbishop and closed in 1989, symbolically, with the assassination of six leading Latin American intellectuals, Jesuit priests, in their rooms at the Jesuit university of San Salvador. The assassins also murdered their housekeeper and her daughter to make sure there would be no witnesses. This was right at the time of the fall of the Berlin Wall and the celebration of the liberation of Soviet satellites. The murderers were from a US-trained brigade, the Atlacatl Brigade, known as El Salvador\u2019s finest, which had already compiled a horrible record of murders and atrocities.\u201d","For example, take George McGovern [1972 Presidential candidate who campaigned on an anti-war platform]. George McGovern did not support the invasion of Panama\u2015in fact, about two months afterwards he wrote an Op-Ed piece in the Washington Post saying he had opposed it from the very moment Bush did it. But he also said that he had refrained from saying so at the time. So if he\'d been asked about it in a poll, he probably would have answered that he did support the invasion. And the reason is, if you\'re a red-blooded patriotic American, then when the government is conducting a violent act you\'re supposed to rally around the flag. That\'s part of our brainwashing, you know\u2015to have that concept of patriotism drilled into our heads. And people really do feel it, even people like George McGovern, somebody who surely would have been in the 20 percent, but if he\'d been polled about it would have voted with the 80 percent. We don\'t want to be \\"anti-American,\\" to use the standard term\u2015which in itself is a pretty startling propaganda triumph, actually. Like, go to Italy and try using the word \\"anti-Italianism,\\" call somebody there \\"anti-Italian\\" and just see what happens\u2015they\'d crack up in ridicule. But here those totalitarian values really do mean something to people, because there have been very extensive and systematic efforts to control the population in ways like that, and they have been highly successful. I mean, there\'s a huge public relations industry in the United States, and it doesn\'t spend billions of dollars a year for nothing, you know. So you really have to be a little bit more careful and nuanced when you interpret these kinds of poll results, in my view.","In a book published in 1963, Richard Tregaskis reported interviews with American helicopter pilots who describe how the \u201cwild men of the 362nd Squadron used to shoot civilians for sport in \u201csolid VC areas.\u201d","An independent mind must seek to separate itself from official doctrine \u2013and from the criticism advanced by its alleged opponent.","The Vietnam War was fought to prevent Vietnam from becoming a successful model of economic and social development for the Third World.","Yeah, in my opinion the heart of the problem is Marxism-Leninism itself\u2015the very idea that a \\"vanguard party\\" can, or has any right to, or has any capacity to lead the stupid masses towards some future they\'re too dumb to understand for themselves. I think what it\'s going to lead them towards is \\"I rule you with a whip.\\" Institutions of domination have a nice way of reproducing themselves\u2015I think that\'s kind of like an obvious sociological truism. And actually, if you look back, that was in fact Bakunin\'s prediction half a century before\u2015he said this was exactly what was going to happen. I mean, Bakunin was talking about the people around Marx, this was before Lenin was born, but his prediction was that the nature of the intelligentsia as a formation in modern industrial society is that they are going to try to become the social managers. Now, they\'re not going to become the social managers because they own capital, and they\'re not going to become the social managers because they\'ve got a lot of guns. They are going to become the social managers because they can control, organize, and direct what\'s called \\"knowledge\\"\u2015they have the skills to process information, and to mobilize support for decision-making, and so on and so forth. And Bakunin predicted that these people would fall into two categories. On the one hand, there would be the \\"left\\" intellectuals, who would try to rise to power on the backs of mass popular movements, and if they could gain power, they would then beat the people into submission and try to control them. On the other hand, if they found that they couldn\'t get power that way themselves, they would become the servants of what we would nowadays call \\"state-capitalism,\\" though Bakunin didn\'t use the term. And either of these two categories of intellectuals, he said, would be \\"beating the people with the people\'s stick\\"\u2015that is, they\'d be presenting themselves as representatives of the people, so they\'d be holding the people\'s stick, but they would be beating the people with it.","Part of the whole capitalist ethic is that the only thing that matters is how much money you make tomorrow: that\'s the crucial value of the system, profit for tomorrow. Not just profit, but the bottom line has to look good tomorrow. And the result is that planning for the future, and any kind of regulatory apparatus that would sustain the environment for the long-term, become impossible\u2015and that means the planet is going to go down the tubes very fast.","As the current U.S.-Israel assault raged, New York Times columnist Thomas Friedman explained that Israel\u2019s tactics in the current attack, as in its invasion of Lebanon in 2006, are based on the sound principle of \u201ctrying to \u2018educate\u2019 Hamas, by inflicting a heavy death toll on Hamas militants and heavy pain on the Gaza population. That makes sense on pragmatic grounds, as it did in Lebanon, where \u201cthe only long-term source of deterrence was to exact enough pain on the civilians\u2014the families and employers of the militants\u2014to restrain Hezbollah in the future.\u201d10 And by similar logic, bin Laden\u2019s effort to \u201ceducate\u201d Americans on 9/11 was highly praiseworthy, as were the Nazi attacks on Lidice and Oradour, Putin\u2019s destruction of Grozny, and other notable educational exercises.\u201d","As far as money and politics are concerned, it\u2019s hard to beat the comment of the great political financier, Mark Hanna.

But those are all considerations that simply don\'t arise for corporate executives, they just are not a part of the agenda.

There is no longer any social necessity for human beings to be treated as mechanical elements in the productive process; that can be overcome and we must overcome it to be a society of freedom and free association, in which the creative urge that I consider intrinsic to human nature will in fact be able to realize itself in whatever way it will.","In the Encyclopedia of social sciences, Harold lasswell, one of the founders of modern political science, warned that the intelligent few must recognize \\"the ignorance and stupidity of the masses.\\" And not succumb to \\"democratic dogmatisms about men being the best judges of their own interests.\\" They are not the best judges; we are. The masses must be controlled for their own good, and in more democratic societies where force is unavailable, social managers must turn to a whole new technique of control, largely through propaganda.

The oil company that was authorized by the Treasury Department under Bush and Clinton to ship oil to the Haitian coup leaders happened to be Texaco. And people of about my age who were attuned to these sorts of things might remember back to the 1930s, when the Roosevelt administration was trying to undermine the Spanish Republic at the time of the Spanish Revolution in 1936 and \'37\u2015you\'ll remember that Texaco also played a role. See, the Western powers were strongly opposed to the Spanish Republican forces at that point during the Spanish Civil War\u2015because the Republican side was aligned with a popular revolution, the anarcho-syndicalist revolution that was breaking out in Spain, and there was a danger that that revolution might take root and spread to other countries. After the anarcho-syndicalist organizations were put down by force, the Western powers didn\'t care so much anymore [anarcho-syndicalism is a sort of non-Leninist or libertarian socialism]. But while the revolution was still going on in Spain and the Republican forces were at war with General Franco and his Fascist army\u2015who were being actively supported by Hitler and Mussolini, remember\u2015the Western countries and Stalinist Russia all wanted to see the Republican forces just gotten rid of. And one of the ways in which the Roosevelt administration helped to see that they were gotten rid of was through what was called the \\"Neutrality Act\\"\u2015you know, we\'re going to be neutral, we\'re not going to send any support to either the Republican side or the Fascist side, we\'re just going to let them fight their own war. Except the \\"Neutrality Act\\" was only 50 percent applied in this case. You see, the Fascists were getting all the guns they needed from Germany, but they didn\'t have enough oil. So therefore the Texaco Oil Company\u2015which happened to be run by an outright Nazi at the time [Captain Thorkild Rieber], something that wasn\'t so unusual in those days, actually\u2015simply terminated its existing oil contracts with the Spanish Republic and redirected its tankers in mid-ocean to start sending the Fascists the oil they needed, in July 1936. It was all totally illegal, of course, but the Roosevelt administration never pushed the issue. And again, the entire American press at the time was never able to discover it\u2015except the small left-wing press: somehow they were able to find out about it. So if you read the small left-wing press in the United States back in 1937, they were reporting this all the time, but the big American newspapers just have never had the resources to find out about things like this, so they never said a word. I mean, years later people writing diplomatic history sort of mention these facts in the margins\u2015but at the time there was nothing in the mainstream.","[Obama] was highly praised, including by his supporters, for his statesmanlike attitude during the lame-duck session, bipartisanship, and getting legislation through.

Of course, no one called it a tax increase. That doesn\'t sound good. They called it a pay freeze. But a pay freeze on public-sector workers is exactly the same thing as a tax increase.

Over the past twenty or thirty years, there\u2019s been a considerable increase in inequality. This trend accelerated during the Reagan years. The society has been moving visibly towards a kind of Third World model. The result is an increasing crime rate, as well as other signs of social disintegration. Most of the crime is poor people attacking each other, but it spills over to more privileged sectors. People are very worried\u2014and quite properly, because the society is becoming very dangerous. A constructive approach to the problem would require dealing with its fundamental causes, but that\u2019s off the agenda, because we must continue with a social policy that\u2019s aimed at strengthening the welfare state for the rich. The only kind of responses the government can resort to under those conditions is pandering to the fear of crime with increasing harshness, attacking civil liberties and attempting to control the poor, essentially by force.","The question is whether distinct cognitive structures can be identified, which interact in the real use of language and linguistic judgments, the grammatical system being one of these.

If you have that grain of honesty in you, say: \u201cOkay, I\u2019m going to honestly be pathological.\u201d Or else just try to break out of it somehow.\u201d","It\u2019s also the word Fox associates with Barack Obama, whom this generation\u2019s door-knocking helped elect but whose administration strengthened the corporate oligarchy, waged unaccountable robot wars, and imprisoned migrant workers and heroic whistleblowers at record rates. So much for \u201csocialism.","El discurso de los privilegios est\xe1 siempre marcado por la confianza y el triunfalismo: conocemos el camino que tenemos delante, y no hay otro camino.","The idea that you have to avoid teaching evolution or pretend you\'re not teaching it is unique in the industrial world. And the statistics are mind-boggling. Roughly half the population think the world was created a couple thousand years ago.","The population is angry, frustrated, bitter\u2014and for good reasons. For the past generation, policies have been initiated that have led to an extremely sharp concentration of wealth in a tiny sector of the population. In fact, the wealth distribution is very heavily weighted by, literally, the top tenth of one percent of the population, a fraction so small that they\u2019re not even picked up on the census. You have to do statistical analysis just to detect them. And they have benefited enormously. This is mostly from the financial sector\u2014hedge fund managers, CEOs of financial corporations, and so on.","The role of intellectuals and radical activists, then, must be to assess and evaluate, to attempt to persuade, to organize, but not to seize power and rule","For instance, there\'s a college in northern California called Chico State, which is where guys like Reagan and Shultz [Reagan\'s Secretary of State] send their kids so they won\'t be infected by \\"lefties\\" at Berkeley. The place is right in the middle of four hundred miles of cornfields, or whatever it is they grow out there, a million miles from nowhere, and when you fly in you land at an airport that\'s about half the size of a house. Well, when I landed there, a student and a faculty member who were like the two local radicals at the school came out to meet me. And as we were walking to the car, I noticed we had to go a pretty long distance, because the airport was all surrounded with yellow police tape. So I asked these guys, \\"What\'s going on, are they rebuilding the landing strip or something?\\" You know what they said? \\"No, that\'s to protect the airport from Arab terrorists.\\" I said, \\"Arab terrorists in northern California?\\" But they thought so. And when I got into the town, everybody was walking around in army fatigues and wearing yellow ribbons, saying \\"If Saddam comes, we\'re going to fight to the death,\\" and so on.","from 1960\u2014remember the date\u2014from 1960 to \u201cthe Soviet collapse in 1990, the numbers of political prisoners, torture victims, and executions of nonviolent political dissenters in Latin America vastly exceeded those in the Soviet Union and East European satellites.","Civil society is hardly more than a conspiracy by the rich to guarantee their plunder.","Occupy is really the first sustained response to this. People have referred to the Tea Party as a response, but that is highly misleading. The Tea Party is relatively affluent, white. Its influence and power come from the fact that it has enormous corporate support and heavy finance. Parts of the corporate world simply see them as their shock troops, but it\u2019s not a movement in the serious sense that Occupy is.","Rand Paul just came out with an appeal for a new organization that will counter the efforts by Obama and Hillary Clinton to shred the last remnants of our sovereignty by allowing the United Nations to take away our guns.6 And then, of course, they will come and conquer us. The basis for this is that the UN is now debating a small arms treaty.7 Small arms doesn\u2019t mean pistols. It means anything less than a tank. These are just slaughtering people all over the world. Hundreds of thousands of people every year are killed with small arms, and a high percentage come from the United States.8 So there is an effort to have some sort of small arms treaty to regulate their flow. In the minds of the Rand Paul libertarians, this is just another effort by this ominous, fiendish outfit, the United Nations, to take away our freedom. \xa0 Rand Paul is the Republican senator from Kentucky and son of Ron Paul.","Of course, it was the United States and Israel that had rejected diplomacy and the PLO that had been offering compromise for years, but Lewis\u2019s reversal of the facts was quite normal and unchallenged in the mainstream.","International law and democracy are fine things\u2014but as judged by outcome, not process; like free trade.","The Amalgamated Engineering and Foundryworkers\u2019 Union, for example, has adopted, as official policy, the program of nationalization of basic industries under \u201cworkers\u2019 control at all levels.","You might look back at the Zionist movement\u2014there were plenty of Jews killed by other Jews. They killed collaborators, traitors and people they thought were traitors. And they weren\u2019t under anything like the harsh conditions of the Palestinian occupation. As plenty of Israelis have pointed out, the British weren\u2019t nice, but they were gentlemen compared with us. The Labor-based defense force Haganah had torture chambers and assassins. I once looked up their first recorded assassination in the official Haganah history. It\u2019s described there straight. It was in 1921. A Dutch Jew named Jacob de Haan had to be killed, because he was trying to approach local Palestinians to see if things could be worked out between them and the new Jewish settlers. His murderer was assumed to be the woman who later became the wife of the first president of Israel. They said that another reason for assassinating him was that he was a homosexual.","[...] dictatorship, the most extreme form of tyranny, can never lead to social liberation.","No podemos evitar abordar cuestiones complejas y controvertidas \u2014especialmente cuando son significativas desde el punto de vista humano\u2014 con un punto de vista definido, con intereses personales, si se quiere, y estos intereses tienen que ser evidentes, de manera que aquellos a los que nos dirigimos puedan entender de d\xf3nde venimos en nuestras opciones e interpretaciones de los hechos de la historia.","one element in the social revolution will be \u201cthat intelligent and truly noble part of the youth which, though belonging by birth to the privileged classes, in its generous convictions and ardent aspirations, adopts the cause of the people.","Now, you can say, \u201cthey rent themselves freely, it\u2019s a free contract\u2014but that\u2019s a joke.

We\u2019ll come back to this. Again from Stuart Hall: \u201cFirst, hegemony is a very particular historically specific and temporary moment in the life of a society. It\u2019s rare for this degree of unity to be achieved, enabling a society to set itself a quite new historical agenda under the leadership of a specific formation or constellation of social forces [with a critical part here]. Such periods of settlement are unlikely to persist forever.\u201d","Thomas Jefferson had rather serious concerns about the fate of the democratic experiment.28 He feared the rise of a new form of absolutism that was more ominous than the British rule overthrown in the American Revolution. He distinguished in his later years between what he called \u201caristocrats and democrats.29 And then he went on to say, \u201cI hope we shall\u2026crush in its birth the aristocracy of our moneyed corporations, which dare already to challenge our government to a trial and bid defiance to the laws of our country.\u201d30 He also wrote, \u201cI sincerely believe\u2026that banking establishments are more dangerous than standing armies.\u201d31 That\u2019s the kind of quote from a Founding Father you don\u2019t see too much.\u201d","You can\u2019t have the United States opposing the peace process, because the peace process is what the United States is doing, by definition. And if anybody is opposing the United States, then they\u2019re opposing the peace process.","If you\u2019ve ever turned on your television set, you know that hundreds of millions of dollars are spent to try to create uninformed consumers who will make irrational choices\u2014that\u2019s what advertising is.","I think that\'s quite true. and in fact the people who understand this the best are those who are carrying out the control and domination in the more free societies. like the U.S. and England, where popular struggles have have won a lot of freedoms over the years and the state has limited capacity to coerce. It is very striking that it\'s precisely in those societies that elite groups\u2014the business world, state managers and so on\u2014recognized early on that they are going to have to develop massive methods of control of attitude and opinion, because you cannot control people by force anymore and therefore you have to modify their consciousness so that they don\'t perceive that they are living under conditions of alienation, oppression, subordination and so on. In fact, that\'s what probably a couple trillion dollars are spent on each year in the U.S., very self-consciously, from the framing of television advertisements for two-year olds to what you are taught in graduate school economics programs. It\'s designed to create a consciousness of subordination and it\'s also intended specifically and pretty consciously to suppress normal human emotions. Normal human emotions are sympathy and solidarity, not just for people but for stranded dolphins. It\'s just a normal reaction for people. If you go back to the classical political economists, people like Adam Smith, this was just taken for granted as the core of human nature and society. One of the main concentrations of advertising and education is to drive that out of your mind. And it\'s very conscious. In fact, it\'s conscious in social policy right in front of our eyes today. Take the effort to destroy Social Security. Well, what\'s the point of that? There\'s a lot of scam about financial problems, which is all total nonsense. And, of course, they want Wall Street to make a killing. Underlying it all is something much deeper. Social Security is based on a human emotion and it\'s a natural human emotion which has to be driven out of people minds, namely the emotion that you care about other people. You care. It\'s a social and community responsibility to care whether a disabled widow across town has enough food to eat, or whether a kid across the street can go to school. You have to get that out of people\'s heads. You have to make them say, \\"Look, you are a personal, rational wealth maximizer. If that disabled widow didn\'t prepare for her own future, it\'s her problem not your problem. It\'s not your fault she doesn\'t have enough to eat so why should you care?","the narratives that become hegemonic are those that reflect the world as seen from the vantage point of the rulers rather than the ruled typically (2016). We\u2019ll come back to this. Again from Stuart Hall: \u201cFirst, hegemony is a very particular historically specific and temporary moment in the life of a society.

Such periods of settlement are unlikely to persist forever.\u201d There\u2019s nothing automatic about them. They have to be actively constructed and positively maintained. Otherwise, such hegemonies risk falling apart. We can see this when we see schisms even within the ruling class,\u201d","there are moments clearly when the seeming solidity of the governance structures are revealed to be rather fragile. And when they are, this is a moment when people begin to call into question all kinds of things about the way in which their society operates. So legitimation crises are extremely troubling moments for governance structures and for elites. As Hall is arguing here, this is invariably the case. And people who want radical change need to be prepared for those moments.","part of the potency of the common sense, is to rule out our thinking any differently about the world. That is, to subjugate our own mental capacity to imagine the world otherwise.","First of all, we\'ve never had capitalism, so it can\'t end. We have some variety of state capitalism. If you fly on an airplane, you\'re basically flying in a modified bomber. If you buy drugs, the basic research was done under public funding and support. The high-tech system is permeated with internal controls, government subsidies. And if you look at what are supposed to be the growing alternatives, China is another form of state capitalism...The question is whether these systems, whatever they are, can be adapted to current problems and circumstances. For example, there\'s no justification, economic or other, for the enormous and growing role of financial institutions since the 1970s. Even some of the most respected economists pint out that they\'re just a drag on the economy. Martin Wolf of the Financial Times says straight out that the financial institutions shouldn\'t be allowed to have anything like the power they do. There\'s plenty of leeway for modification and change. Worker-owned industries can take over. There\'s interesting work on this topic by Gar Alperovitz, who has been right at the center of a lot of organizing around worker control. It\'s not a revolution, but it\'s the germ of another type of capitalism, capitalism in the sense that markets and profit are involved.","Hoy la pol\xedtica se ha reducido a una aventura lucrativa en la que se busca, sobre todo, que las inversiones sean rentables m\xe1s que contribuir a la reconstrucci\xf3n de un entorno, una comunidad o una naci\xf3n muy degradados.

In fact, I think it\u2019s grotesque at any level.\u201d","In all post-emancipation societies the balance between the possibility of land ownership and self-sufficiency for ex-slaves and their dependence on wager labor determined the tightness of this labor control. In the US South planters effectively transformed ex-slaves into an agricultural proletariat with a gamut of labor relations ranging from tenancy to sharecropping to debt-peonage. The necessary political corollary of this labor system was the preservation of white supremacy.","Whenever I hear a four-syllable word I get skeptical, because I want to make sure you can\u2019t say it in monosyllables.","En Estados Unidos, el pa\xeds m\xe1s rico del mundo, que posee ventajas sin igual e instituciones democr\xe1ticas estables, pero que a la vez est\xe1, m\xe1s que ninguna otra sociedad, bajo el dominio de los hombres de negocios.","A consistent anarchist must oppose private ownership of the means of production and the wage slavery which is a component of this system, as incompatible with the principle that labor must be freely undertaken and under the control of the producer.","It\u2019s going to take larger popular movements to change this, and that can happen, it\u2019s happened in the past.

They were won by the labour movement and by the women\u2019s movement and by the civil rights movement and by other human rights movements. They\u2019re won by popular struggle but they\u2019re never given as gifts, and they won\u2019t be in the future.","And since one of the main purposes of social policy is to keep the population passive, people with power are going to want to eliminate anything that tends to encourage the population to get involved in planning\u2015because popular involvement threatens the monopoly of power by business, and it also stimulates popular organizations, and mobilizes people, and probably would lead to redistribution of profits, and so on.","There is a crucial omission.
