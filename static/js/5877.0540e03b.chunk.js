The","Compare \u2018now\u2019 with \u2018here\u2019. \u2018Here\u2019 designates the place where a speaker is: for two different people \u2018here\u2019 points to two different places. Consequently \u2018here\u2019 is a word the meaning of which depends on where it is spoken. The technical term for this kind of utterance is \u2018indexical\u2019. \u2018Now\u2019 also points to the instant in which the word is uttered and is also classed as \u2018indexical\u2019. But no one would dream of saying that things \u2018here\u2019 exist, whereas things that are not \u2018here\u2019 do not exist.

This strange, multicoloured and astonishing world which we explore \u2013 where space is granular, time does not exist, and things are nowhere \u2013 is not something that estranges us from our true selves, for this is only what our natural curiosity reveals to us about the place of our dwelling. About the stuff of which we ourselves are made.","You don\u2019t get to new places by following established tracks.","What opens our minds and shows the limits of our ideas is an encounter with other people, other cultures, other ideas.","We understand the world in its becoming, not in its being.","But it isn\u2019t absence that causes sorrow. It is affection and love. Without affection, without love, such absences would cause us no pain. For this reason, even the pain caused by absence is, in the end, something good and even beautiful, because it feeds on that which gives meaning to life.","This is the disconcerting conclusion that emerges from Boltzmann\u2019s work: the difference between the past and the future refers only to our own blurred vision of the world. It\u2019s a conclusion that leaves us flabbergasted: is it really possible that a perception so vivid, basic, existential\u2014my perception of the passage of time\u2014depends on the fact that I cannot apprehend the world in all of its minute detail? On a kind of distortion that\u2019s produced by myopia?

In the awareness that we can always be wrong, and therefore ready at any moment to change direction if a new track appears; but knowing also that if we are good enough we will get it right and will find what we are seeking.

It is only in interactions that nature draws the world.","We are all in the depths of a cave, chained by our ignorance, by our prejudices, and our weak senses reveal to us only shadows.

Thoughts and emotions that create bonds of attachment between us have no difficulty in crossing seas and decades, sometimes even centuries, tied to thin sheets of paper or dancing between the microchips of a computer.

Our culture is foolish to keep science and poetry separated: they are two tools to open our eyes to the complexity and beauty of the world.","Before Newton, time for humanity was the way of counting how things changed. Before him, no one had thought it possible that a time independent of things could exist. Don\'t take your intuitions and ideas to be \'natural\': they are often the products of the ideas of audacious thinkers who came before us.","Life on Earth gives only a small taste of what can happen in the universe.","We are made of the same stardust of which all things are made, and when we are immersed in suffering or when we are experiencing intense joy, we are being nothing other than what we can\u2019t help but be: a part of our world.","Life is precious to us because it is ephemeral.","In the world described by quantum mechanics there is no reality except in the relations between physical systems. It isn\u2019t things that enter into relations but, rather, relations that ground the notion of \u2018thing\u2019. The world of quantum mechanics is not a world of objects: it is a world of events. Things are built by the happening of elementary events: as the philosopher Nelson Goodman wrote in the 1950s, in a beautiful phrase, \u2018An object is a monotonous process.\u2019 A stone is a vibration of quanta that maintains its structure for a while, just as a marine wave maintains its identity for a while before melting again into the sea.","Here, in the vanguard, beyond the borders of knowledge, science becomes even more beautiful\u2014incandescent in the forge of nascent ideas, of intuitions, of attempts. Of roads taken and then abandoned, of enthusiasms. In the effort to imagine what has not yet been imagined.

The glass shatters into a thousand pieces, and the pieces do not re-form into a glass. We cannot change the past; we can have regrets, remorse, memories. The future instead is uncertainty, desire, anxiety, open space, destiny, perhaps. We can live toward it, shape it, because it does not yet exist. Everything is still possible... Time is not a line with two equal directions: it is an arrow with different extremities.","To the very last, the desire to challenge oneself and understand more. And to the very last: doubt.","All things are continually interacting with each other, and in doing so each bears the traces of that with which it has interacted: and in this sense all things continuously exchange information about each other.","I do not fear death. I fear suffering. And I fear old age, though less so now that I am witnessing the tranquil and pleasant old age of my father. I am afraid of frailty, and of the absence of love. But death does not alarm me. It did not scare me when I was young, and I thought at the time that this was because it was such a remote prospect. But now, at sixty, the fear has yet to arrive. I love life, but life is also struggle, suffering, pain. I think of death as akin to a well-earned rest.","Human beings often cling to their certainties for fear that their opinions will be proven false. But a certainty that cannot be called into question is not a certainty. Solid certainties are those that survive questioning. In order to accept questioning as the foundation for our voyage toward knowledge, we must be humble enough to accept that today\u2019s truth may become tomorrow\u2019s falsehood.","Science is a continual exploration of ways of thinking. Its strength is its visionary capacity to demolish preconceived ideas, to reveal new regions of reality, and to construct new and more effective images of the world. This adventure rests upon the entirety of past knowledge, but at its heart is change.","Le equazioni della meccanica quantistica e le loro conseguenze vengono usate quotidianamente da fisici, ingegneri, chimici e biologi, nei campi pi\xf9 svariati. Sono utilissime per tutta la tecnologia contemporanea. Non ci sarebbero i transistor senza la meccanica quantistica. Eppure restano misteriose: non descrivono cosa succede a un sistema fisico, ma solo come un sistema fisico viene percepito da un altro sistema fisico. Che significa? Significa che la realt\xe0 essenziale di un sistema \xe8 indescrivibile? Significa solo che manca un pezzo alla storia? O significa, come a me sembra, che dobbiamo accettare l\u2019idea che la realt\xe0 sia solo interazione?","It is entropy, not energy, that keeps stones on the ground and the world turning.","When we talk about the big bang or the fabric of space, what we are doing is not a continuation of the free and fantastic stories that humans have told nightly around campfires for hundreds of thousands of years. It is the continuation of something else: of the gaze of those same men in the first light of day looking at tracks left by antelope in the dust of the savannah\u2014scrutinizing and deducting from the details of reality in order to pursue something that we can\u2019t see directly but can follow the traces of. In the awareness that we can always be wrong, and therefore ready at any moment to change direction if a new track appears; but knowing also that if we are good enough we will get it right and will find what we are seeking. This is the nature of science. The confusion between these two diverse human activities\u2014inventing stories and following traces in order to find something\u2014is the origin of the incomprehension and distrust of science shown by a significant part of our contemporary culture. The separation is a subtle one: the antelope hunted at dawn is not far removed from the antelope deity in that night\u2019s storytelling. The border is porous. Myths nourish science, and science nourishes myth. But the value of knowledge remains. If we find the antelope, we can eat.","We are stories, contained within the twenty complicated centimeters behind our eyes, lines drawn by traces left by the (re)mingling together of things in the world, and oriented toward predicting events in the future, toward the direction of increasing entropy, in a rather particular corner of this immense, chaotic universe.","The incompleteness and the uncertainty of our knowledge, our precariousness, suspended over the abyss of the immensity of what we don\u2019t know, does not render life meaningless: it makes it interesting and precious.","O gentlemen, the time of life is short\xa0.\xa0.\xa0. And if we live, we live to tread on kings. Shakespeare, Henry IV, Part I (act 5, scene 2)","If things fall, it is due to this slowing down of time. Where time passes uniformly, in interplanetary space, things do not fall. They float, without falling. Here on the surface of our planet, on the other hand, the movement of things inclines naturally toward where time passes more slowly, as when we run down the beach into the sea and the resistance of the water on our legs makes us fall headfirst into the waves. Things fall downward because, down there, time is slowed by the Earth.","The world is complex, and we capture it with different languages, each appropriate to the process that we are describing.","Being aware that we may be wrong is different from claiming that it is senseless to speak of right and wrong. Recognizing diversity and taking seriously ideas that diverge from our own is different from claiming that all ideas are equally worthy. Knowing that a given judgment is born within a complex cultural context and is related to many others does not necessarily imply that we are unable to recognize it is wrong.","This does not mean that science is just the art of making measurable predictions. Some philosophers of science overly circumscribe science by limiting it to its numerical predictions. They miss the point, because they confuse the instruments with the objectives. Verifiable quantitative predictions are instruments to validate hypotheses. The objective of scientific research is not just to arrive at predictions: it is to understand how the world functions; to construct and develop an image of the world, a conceptual structure to enable us to think about. Before being technical, science is visionary.","We can think of the world as made up of things. Of substances. Of entities. Of something that is. Or we can think of it as made up of events. Of happenings. Of processes. Of something that occurs. Something that does not last, and that undergoes continual transformation, that is not permanent in time.","Nature is behaving with us like that elderly rabbi to whom two men went in order to settle a dispute. Having listened to the first, the rabbi says: \u201cYou are in the right. The second insists on being heard. The rabbi listens to him and says: \u201cYou\u2019re also right.\u201d Having overheard from the next room, the rabbi\u2019s wife then calls out, \u201cBut they can\u2019t both be in the right!\u201d The rabbi reflects and nods before concluding: \u201cAnd you\u2019re right too.\u201d A\u201d","A university student attending lectures on general relativity i the morning and others on quantum mechanics in the afternoon might be forgiven for thinking that his professors are fools, or have neglected to communicate with each other for at least a century.","An elementary structure of the world is emerging, generated by a swarm of quantum events, where time and space do not exist. Quantum fields draw together space, time, matter, and light, exchanging information between one event and another. Reality is a network of granular events; the dynamic that connects them is probabilistic; between one event and another, space, time, matter, and energy melt into a cloud of probability.","Children grow up and discover that the world is not as it seemed from within the four walls of their homes. Humankind as a whole does the same.","It is not against nature to be curious: it is our nature to be so.","che significa che siamo liberi di prendere delle decisioni, se il nostro comportamento non fa che seguire le leggi della natura?","Things change only in relation to one another. At a fundamental level, there is no time.","The world, particles, light, energy, space, and time\u2014all of this is nothing but the manifestation of a single type of entity: covariant quantum fields.","A moving object therefore experiences a shorter duration than a stationary one: a watch marks fewer seconds, a plant grows more slowly, a young man dreams less. For a moving object, time contracts.","Quantum mechanics reveals to us that the more we look at the detail of the world, the less constant it is. The world is not made up of tiny pebbles. It is a world of vibrations, a continuous fluctuation, a microscopic swarming of fleeting microevents.","We have a hundred billion neurons in our brains, as many as there are stars in a galaxy, with an even more astronomical number of links and potential combinations through which they can interact. We are not conscious of all of this. \u201cWe are the process formed by this entire intricacy, not just by the little of it of which we are conscious.\u201d","Science is about reading the world from a gradually widening point of view.","The most credible answers are the ones given by science, because science IS the search for the most credible answers available, not for answers pretending to certainty.","We are the products of a long selection process of chemical, biological, and cultural structures that at different levels have interacted for a long time in order to shape the funny process that we are.","The world is like a collection of interrelated points of view.","In the awareness that we can always be wrong, and therefore ready at any moment to change direction if a new track appears; but knowing also that if we are good enough we will get it right and will find what we are seeking. This is the nature of science. The","But it is not only space that curves: time does too. Einstein predicts that time on Earth passes more quickly at higher altitude, and more slowly at lower altitude. This is measured, and also proves to be the case. Today we have extremely precise clocks, in many laboratories, and it is possible to measure this strange effect even for a difference in altitude of just a few centimeters. Place a watch on the floor and another on a table: the one on the floor registers less passing of time than the one on the table. Why? Because time is not universal and fixed; it is something that expands and shrinks, according to the vicinity of masses: Earth, like all masses, distorts spacetime, slowing down time in its vicinity. Only slightly\u2014but two twins who have lived respectively at sea level and in the mountains will find that, when they meet up again, one will have aged more than the other","The border is porous.

If we find the antelope, we can eat.","Every moment of our existence is linked by a peculiar triple thread to our past\u2014the most recent and the most distant\u2014by memory. Our present swarms with traces of our past. We are histories of ourselves, narratives. I am not this momentary mass of flesh reclined on the sofa typing the letter a on my laptop; I am my thoughts full of the traces of the phrases that I am writing; I am my mother\u2019s caresses, and the serene kindness with which my father calmly guided me; I am my adolescent travels; I am what my reading has deposited in layers in my mind; I am my loves, my moments of despair, my friendships, what I\u2019ve written, what I\u2019ve heard; the faces engraved on my memory.

My life consists of it.\u201d","Within the immense ocean of galaxies and stars we are in a remote corner; amidst the infinite arabesques of forms which constitute reality we are merely a flourish among innumerably many such flourishes.","In quantum mechanics no object has a definite position, except when colliding headlong with something else.","For everything that moves, time passes more slowly.","When we say that human behaviour is unpredictable, we are right, because it is too complex to be predicted, especially by ourselves. Our intense sensation of internal liberty, as Spinoza acutely saw, comes from the fact that the ideas and images which we have of ourselves are much cruder and sketchier than the detailed complexity of what is happening within us. We are the source of amazement in our own eyes","National identity is a con. It\'s good for overcoming local interests for the common good, but it is short-sighted and counterproductive when it promotes the interests of a totally artificial group \u2013 \'our nation\' \u2013 above a more ample sense of what the common good consists of.","Science is born from this act of humility: not trusting blindly in our past knowledge and our intuition. Not believing what everyone says. Not having faith in the accumulated knowledge of our fathers and grandfathers. We learn nothing if we think that we already know the essentials, if we assume that they were written in a book or known by the elders of the tribe. The centuries in which people had faith in what they believed were the centuries in which little new was learned.","Temporality is profoundly linked to blurring. The blurring is due to the fact that we are ignorant of the microscopic details of the world. The time of physics is, ultimately, the expression of our ignorance of the world. Time is ignorance.","An individual is a process: complex, tightly integrated.","The heat of black holes is like the Rosetta stone of physics, written in a combination of three languages- quantum, gravitational, and thermodynamic- still awaiting decipherment in order to reveal the true nature of time.","I believe that our species will not last long.

Sometimes it is a cry of pain. Sometimes it is a song.","The notion of \u201cthe present refers to things that are close to us, not to anything that is far away.

On the one hand, there was time, with its many determinations; on the other, the simple fact that nothing is: things happen.","But this does not imply that we cannot or must not trust our own thinking. To the contrary: our own thinking is the best tool we have for finding our way in this world. Recognizing its limitations does not imply that it is not something to rely upon.

It is often said that science takes steps forward only when there is new experimental data. If this were true, we would have little hope of finding the theory of quantum gravity before measuring something new, but this is patently not the case. Which new data were available to Copernicus? None. He had the same data as Ptolemy. Which new data did Newton have? Almost none. His real ingredients were Kepler\'s laws and Galileo\'s results. What new data did Einstein have to discover general relativity? None. His ingredients were special relativity and Newton\'s theory. It simply isn\'t true that physics only advances when it is afforded new data.","The difference between past and future only exists when there is heat. The fundamental phenomenon that distinguishes the future from the past is the fact that heat passes from things that are hotter to things that are colder.","Don\'t take your intuitions and ideas to be \'natural\': they are often the products of the ideas of audacious thinkers who came before us.","what does it mean, our being free to make decisions, if our behavior does nothing but follow the predetermined laws of nature?","Electrons, quarks, photons, and gluons are the components of everything that sways in the space around us.

Consider","In the elementary equations of the world,13 the arrow of time appears only where there is heat.* The link between time and heat is therefore fundamental: every time a difference is manifested between the past and the future, heat is involved. In every sequence of events that becomes absurd if projected backward, there is something that is heating up. If I watch a film that shows a ball rolling, I cannot tell if the film is being projected correctly or in reverse. But if the ball stops, I know that it is being run properly; run backward, it would show an implausible event: a ball starting to move by itself. The ball\u2019s slowing down and coming to rest are due to friction, and friction produces heat. Only where there is heat is there a distinction between past and future. Thoughts, for instance, unfold from the past to the future, not vice versa\u2014and, in fact, thinking produces heat in our heads.\xa0.\xa0.\xa0.","Those who criticize the usefulness of philosophy for science, Aristotle has noticed, are not doing science: they are doing philosophy.","Bertrand Russell describes the same idea thus: \u201cthe raw material out of which the world is built up is not of two sorts, one matter and the other mind; it is simply arranged in different patterns by its inter-relations: some arrangements may be called mental, while others may be called physical.","We belong to a short-lived genus of species.

What we see does not cease to astonish us. We realize that we are full of prejudices and that our intuitive image of the world is partial, parochial, inadequate. Earth is not flat; it is not stationary. The world continues to change before our eyes as we gradually see it more extensively and more clearly. If we try to put together what we have learned in the twentieth century about the physical world, the clues point toward something profoundly different from our instinctive understanding of matter, space, and time.","The entropy of the world in the far past appears very low to us. But this might not reflect the exact state of the world: it might regard the subset of the world\' s variables with which we, as physical systems, have interacted. It is with respect to the dramatic blurring produced by our interactions with the world, caused by the small set of macroscopic variables in terms of which we describe the world, that the entropy of the universe was low.","We can see the world without time: we can perceive with the mind\u2019s eye the profound structure of the world where time as we know it no longer exists\u2014like the Fool on the Hill who sees the Earth turn when he sees the setting sun. And we begin to see that we are time. We are this space, this clearing opened by the traces of memory inside the connections between our neurons. We are memory. We are nostalgia. We are longing for a future that will not come. The clearing that is opened up in this way, by memory and by anticipation, is time: a source of anguish sometimes, but in the end a tremendous gift.","Science is born from this act of humility: not trusting blindly in our past knowledge and our intuition. Not believing what everyone says. Not having absolute faith in the accumulated knowledge of our fathers and grandfathers. We learn nothing if we think we already know the essentials, if we assume that they were written in a book or known by the elders of the tribe. The centuries in which people had faith in what they believed were the centuries in which little new was learned. Had they trusted the knowledge of their fathers, Einstein, Newton, and Copernicus would never have called things into question and would never have been able to move our knowledge forward (259, trsl.

Nature, for its part, is what it is, and we discover it very gradually. If our grammar and our intuition do not readily adapt to what we discover, well, too bad. We must seek to adapt them.","Every cubic centimeter of space, and every second that passes, is the result of this dancing foam of extremely small quanta.","Time opens up our limited access to the world. Time, then, is the form in which we beings, whose brains are made up essentially of memory and foresight, interact with the world: it is the source of identity.","Ten years before understanding that time is slowed down by mass,21 Einstein had realized that it was slowed down by speed.22 The consequence of this discovery for our basic intuitive perception of time is the most devastating of all. The fact itself is quite simple. Instead of sending the two friends from the first chapter to the mountains and the plains, respectively, let\u2019s ask one of them to stay still and the other one to walk around. Time passes more slowly for the one who keeps moving. As before, the two friends experience different durations: the one who moves ages less quickly, his watch marks less time passing; he has less time in which to think; the plant he is carrying takes longer to germinate, and so on. For everything that moves, time passes more slowly.","Hold on tight, because we are about to take off. \u201cNOW MEANS NOTHING What is happening \u201cnow\u201d in a distant place?

What is your sister doing now on Proxima b? The only correct answer is that the question makes no sense. It is like asking \u201cWhat is here, in Beijing?\u201d when we are in Venice.\u201d","Science is not reliable because it provides certainty. It is reliable because it provides us with the best answers we have at present. Science is the most we know so far about the problems confronting us. It is precisely its openness, the fact that it constantly calls current knowledge into question, which guarantees that the answers it offers are the best so far available: if you find better answers, these new answers become science.","The hardest stone, in the light of what we have learned from chemistry, from physics, from mineralogy, from geology, from psychology, is in reality a complex vibration of quantum fields, a momentary interaction of forces, a process that for a brief moment manages to keep its shape, to hold itself in equilibrium before disintegrating again into dust, a brief chapter in the history of interactions between the elements of the planet, a trace of Neolithic humanity, a weapon used by a gang of kids, an example in a book about time, a metaphor for an ontology, a part of a segmentation of the world that depends more on how our bodies are structured to perceive than on the object of perception \u2013 and, gradually, an intricate knot in that cosmic game of mirrors that constitutes reality.","En el mar inmenso de galaxias y estrellas, somos un apartado rinc\xf3n infinitesimal; entre los infinitos arabescos de formas que componen lo real, nosotros no somos m\xe1s que un garabato entre muchos.","we have realized that it is our immediate intuitions that are imprecise:","Is the daily spectacle of a revolving universe \u201cillusory?

The other species in the group have already become extinct; some, like the Neanderthals, quite recently, roughly thirty thousand years ago. It is group of species which evolved in Africa, akin to the hierarchical and quarrelsome chimpanzees -- and even more closely akin to the bonobos, the small, peaceful, cheerfully egalitarian and promiscuous type of chimps. A group of species which repeatedly went out of Africa in order to explore new worlds, and went far: as far, eventually, as Patagonia -- and as far, eventually, as the moon.

The entire evolution of science would suggest that the best grammar for thinking about the world is that of change not of permanence, not of being but of becoming.

The first is Dubito ergo cogito. The starting point of the reconstruction is not a hypothetical a priori that is immediate to the experience of existing as a subject. It\u2019s a rationalistic a posteriori reflection on the first stage of the process in which Descartes had articulated a state of doubt: logic dictates that if someone doubts something, they must have thought about it. And that if they can think, then they must exist.","And it seems to me that life, this brief life, is nothing other than this: the incessant cry of these emotions that drive us, that we sometimes attempt to channel in the name of a god, a political faith, in a ritual that reassures us that, fundamentally, everything is in order, in a great and boundless love\u2014and the cry is beautiful. Sometimes it is a cry of pain. Sometimes it is a song. And song, as Augustine observed, is the awareness of time. It is time.

They cannot be predicated in an unequivocal way, but only in a probabilisitc one. This is the vertiginous dive taken by Bohr, Heisenberg, and Dirac-into the depth of the nature of things.","The entropy of a system depends explicitly on blurring. It depends on what I do not register, because it depends on the number of indistinguishable configurations. The same microscopic configuration may be of high entropy with regard to one blurring and of low in relation to another.","The entropy of the world in the far past appears very low to us.

This, which is a fact, opens up the possibility that it wasn\u2019t the universe that was in a very particular configuration in the past. Perhaps instead it is us, and our interactions with the universe, that are particular. We are the ones who determine a particular macroscopic description.

By weighing the box, it is possible to deduce the energy of the released photon. Einstein hoped that thus would create difficulties for quantum mechanics, which predicts that time and energy cannot both be precisely determined. Bohr replied, mistakenly, that the way out of the difficulty required Einstein\'s general relativity, and Einstein, mistakenly, accepted Bohr\'s reply. The correct response to Einstein, that Bohr was unable to find but is clear today, is that the position of the escaping photon and the weight of the box remain tied to each other (\\"correlated\\") even if the photon is already far away.","Einstein was no great mathematician. He struggled with maths. He says this himself. In 1943 he replied in the following way to a nine-year-old child with the name of Barbara who wrote to him about her difficulties with the subject: \u2018Don\u2019t worry about experiencing difficulties with maths, I can assure you that my own problems are even more serious!\u20192 It seems like a joke, but Einstein was not kidding. With mathematics, he needed help: he had it explained to him by patient fellow students and friends, such as Marcel Grossman. It was his intuition as a physicist that was prodigious.","Too often scientists sell hypothetical theories to the large public, as if they were established theories. I have seen this often done, for instance, with string theory. I think this is a great mistake, because it questions the credibility itself of science. We scientists live out of public money and it is our duty to be fully honest in reporting what we know and what we do not know. We are paid to dream, but we must not sell our dreams for established realities.","All of this, I believe, indicates that in order to grasp the basic grammar of the world, we need to merge three basic ingredients, not just two: not just general relativity and quantum mechanics, but also the theory of heat, that is, statistical mechanics and thermodynamics, which we can also describe as \u201cinformation theory.","The mystery of time has always troubled us, stirring deep emotions. So deep as to have nourished philosophies and religions.","The idea of thermal time reverses this observation. That is to say, instead of inquiring how time produces dissipation in heat, it asks how heat produces time. Thanks to Boltzmann, we know that the notion of heat comes from the fact that we interact with averages. The idea of thermal time is that the notion of time, as well, comes from the fact that we interact only with averages of many variables.* As long as we have a complete description of a system, all the variables of the system are on the same footing; none of them act as a time variable. That is to say, none is correlated to irreversible phenomena. But as soon as we describe the system by means of averages of many variables, we have a preferred variable that functions like common time. A time along which heat dissipates. The time of our everyday experience. Hence time is not a fundamental constituent of the world, but it appears because the world is immense, and we are small systems within the world, interacting only with macroscopic variables that average among innumerable small, microscopic variables. We, in our everyday lives, never see a single elementary particle, or a single quantum of space. We see stones, mountains, the faces of our friends\u2014and each of these things we see is formed by myriads of elementary components. We are always correlated with averages. Averages behave like averages: they disperse heat and, intrinsically, generate time.","Our \u201cpresent does not extend throughout the universe. It is like a bubble around us.\u201d","The idea that a well-defined now exists throughout the universe is an illusion, an illegitimate extrapolation of our own experience.","What Copernicus, Newton, Einstein, and many others did was to build upon preexisting theories that synthesized empirical knowledge across vast fields of nature, and to find a way of combining and rethinking them, to improve the general picture.","To accept uncertainty doesn\u2019t detract from our sense of mystery.","It is in order to escape this anxiety that we have imagined the existence of \u201ceternity, a strange world outside of time that we would like to be inhabited by gods, by a God, or by immortal souls.\u201d","We must distinguish between clues and strong evidence. Clues are what set Sherlock Holmes on the right track, allowing him to solve a mysterious case. Strong evidence is what the judge needs to sentence the guilty.

From this you may picture what it is for the atoms to be perpetually tossed about in the illimitable void. To some extent a small thing may afford an illustration and an imperfect image of great things. Besides, there is a further reason why you should give your mind to these particles that are seen dancing in a sunbeam: their dancing is an actual indication of underlying movements of matter that are hidden from our sight. There you will see many particles under the impact of invisible blows, changing their course and driven back upon their tracks, this way and that, in all directions. You must understand that they all derive this restlessness from the atoms. It originates with the atoms, which move of themselves. Then those small compound bodies that are least removed from the impetus of the atoms are set in motion by the impact of their invisible blows and in turn cannon against slightly larger bodies. So the movement mounts up from the atoms and gradually emerges to the level of our senses, so that those bodies are in motion that we see in sunbeams, moved by blows that remain invisible.23","Ever since we discovered that the Earth is round and turns like a mad spinning-top we have understood that reality is not as it appears to us: every time we glimpse a new aspect of it, it is a deeply emotional experience.

Except for special cases, the Schrodinger\'s wave is not in physical space, and this divests it of all its intuitive character. But the main reason why Schrodinger\'s wave is a bad image of reality is the fact that when a particle collides with something else, it is always at a point: it is never spread out in space like a wave. If we conceive an electron as a wave, we get in trouble explaining how this wave instantly concentrates to a point at each collision. Schrodinger\'s wave is not a useful representation of reality: it is an aid to calculation that permits us to predict with some degree of precision where the electron will reappear.

This implies that mass, by itself, is not conserved; and energy-as it was conceived at the time-is not independently conserved, either. One may be transformed into the other: only one single law of conservation exists, not two. What is conserved is the sum of mass and energy, not each separately. Processes must exist that transform energy into mass, or mass into energy.","Because science shows us how to better understand the world, but it also reveals to us just how vast is the extent of what is still not known.

This adventure rests upon the entirety of past knowledge, but at its heart is change. The world is boundless and iridescent; we want to go and see it. We are immersed in its mystery and in its beauty, and over the horizon there is unexplored territory.

What if Newton\'s space was nothing more than the gravitational field? This extremely simple, beautiful, brilliant idea is the theory of general relativity.","What role do we have as human beings who perceive, make decisions, laugh, and cry, in this great fresco of the world as depicted by contemporary physics?","In light of Hipparchus and Ptolemy\u2019s extraordinarily successful predictive theories, the goal of astronomy was to find the right combination of circles to describe the motion of the heavenly bodies around the Earth. Contrary to expectations, it turned out that Earth was itself one of the heavenly bodies. After Copernicus, the goal appeared to be to find the right combination of moving spheres that would reproduce the motion of the planets around the Sun. Contrary to expectations, it turned out that abstract elliptical trajectories were better than spheres. After Newton, it seemed clear that the aim of physics was to find the forces acting on bodies. Contrary to this, it turned out that the world could be better described by dynamical fields rather than bodies. After Faraday and Maxwell, it was clear that physics had to find laws of motion in space, as time passes. Contrary to assumptions, it turned out that space and time are themselves dynamical. After Einstein, it became clear that physics must only search for the deterministic laws of Nature. But it turned out that we can at best give probabilistic laws. And so on. Here are some sliding definitions for what scientists have thought science to be: deduction of general laws from observed phenomena, finding out the ultimate constituents of Nature, accounting for regularities in empirical observations, finding provisional conceptual schemes for making sense of the world. (The last one is the one I like.) Science is not a project with a methodology written in stone, or a fixed conceptual structure. It is our ever-evolving endeavor to better understand the world. In the course of its development, it has repeatedly violated its own rules and its own stated methodological assumptions.","We are for ourselves in large measure what we see and have seen of ourselves reflected back to us by our friends, our loves, and our enemies.","Only where there is heat is there a distinction between past and future.","The theory does not describe things as they \u201care: it describes how things \u201coccur,\u201d and how they \u201cinteract with each other.\u201d It doesn\u2019t describe where there is a particle but how the particle shows itself to others.

We know that we are myopic-we barely see a tiny window of the vast electromagnetic spectrum emitted by things. We do not see the atomic structure of matter nor the curvature of space. We see a coherent world that we extrapolate from our interaction with the universe, organized in simplistic terms that our devastatingly stupid brain is capable of handling.

This permanent doubt, the deep source of science.","Le cose si trasformano l\u2019una nell\u2019altra secondo  necessit\xe0 e si rendono giustizia secondo l\u2019ordine del tempo.","There is no \u201ctruer time; there are two times and they change relative to each other. Neither is truer than the other. But there are not just two times. Times are legion: a different one for every point in space. There is not one single time; there is a vast multitude of them.\u201d","Even if we observe a small, empty region of space in which there are no atoms, we still detect a minute swarming of these particles.","the gravitational field is not diffused through space; the gravitational field is that space itself.","Our moral values, our emotions, our loves are no less real for being part of nature, for being shared with the animal world, or for being determined by the evolution which our species has undergone over millions of years. Rather, they are more valuable as a result of this: they are real. They are the complex reality of which we are made. Our reality is tears and laughter, gratitude and altruism, loyalty and betrayal, the past which haunts us and serenity.","Why do we remember the past and not the future?","Bertrand Russell noted this in a famous article, writing emphatically that \u201cThe law of causality\xa0.\xa0.\xa0. is a relic of a bygone age, surviving, like the monarchy, only because it is erroneously supposed to do no harm.","The expanded present is the set of events that are neither past nor future: it exists, just as there are human beings who are neither our descendants nor our forebears.","Perhaps the rivers of ink that have been expended discussing the nature of the \u201ccontinuous over the centuries, from Aristotle to Heidegger, have been wasted. Continuity is only a mathematical technique for approximating very finely grained things. The world is subtly discrete, not continuous. The good Lord has not drawn the world with continuous lines: with a light hand, he has sketched it in dots, like the painter Georges Seurat.\u201d","If the present has no meaning, then what \u201cexists in the universe? Is not what \u201cexists\u201d precisely what is here \u201cin the present\u201d?\u201d","Even the distinction between present, past, and future thus becomes fluctuating, indeterminate. Just as a particle may be diffused in space, so, too, the differences between past and future may fluctuate: an event may be both before and after another one.","Happy and master of himself is the man who for every day of his life can say: \u201cToday I have lived; tomorrow if God extends for us a horizon of dark clouds or designs a morning of limpid light, he will not change our poor past he will do nothing without the memory of events that the fleeting hour will have assigned to us.","Newton, who resuscitated the Democritean idea of space, had tried to patch things up by arguing that space was God\u2019s sensorium. No one has ever understood what Newton meant by \u2018God\u2019s sensorium\u2019, perhaps not even Newton himself.","we are nothing but images of images. Reality, including our selves, is nothing but a thin and fragile veil, beyond which\xa0.\xa0.\xa0. there is nothing.","All of this, I believe, indicates that in order to grasp the basic grammar of the world, we need to merge three basic ingredients, not just two: not just general relativity and quantum mechanics, but also the theory of heat, that is, statistical mechanics and thermodynamics, which we can also describe as \\"information theory.\\" But the thermodynamics of general relativity-that is to say, the statistical mechanics of quanta of space-is as yet only in its early infancy. Everything is still confused, and there is a very great deal that remains to be understood.","Where time passes uniformly, in interplanetary space, things do not fall.","Hollandal\u0131 felsefeci Baruch Spinoza\'n\u0131n 17. y\xfczy\u0131lda m\xfcthi\u015f bir sa\u011fduyuyla anlad\u0131\u011f\u0131 gibi, bu ikisi ayn\u0131 \u015feydir. \\"Ben\\" ve \\"beynimdeki n\xf6ronlar\\" diye iki ayr\u0131 \u015fey yoktur.

There is a lower limit to the divisibility of space.","We are like an only child who in growing up realizes that the world does not revolve only around himself, as he thought when little, Rovelli writes. \u201cMirrored by others, and by other things, we learn who we are.\u201d","Our culture is foolish to keep science and poetry separated: they are two tools to open our eyes to the complexity and beauty of the world.","The Einstein who makes more errors than anyone else is precisely the same Einstein who succeeds in understanding more about nature than anyone else.","The difference between past and future only exists when there is heat.","Thus, it is possible to measure time by simply counting the oscillations of a pendulum. It seems such an obvious idea, but it took Galileo to find it; it had not occurred to anyone before him. So it goes, with science.","If we are special we are only special in the way that everyone feels themselves to be, as every mother is to her child. Certainly not for the rest of nature.","Perhaps poetry is another of science\'s deepest roots: the capacity to see beyond the visible.","There are absolute masterpieces that move us intensely: Mozart\u2019s Requiem, Homer\u2019s Odyssey, the Sistine Chapel, King Lear. To fully appreciate their brilliance may require a long apprenticeship, but the reward is sheer beauty\u2014and not only this, but the opening of our eyes to a new perspective upon the world. Einstein\u2019s jewel, the general theory of relativity, is a masterpiece of this order.

When it does, the durations are granular and determinate only for that something with which it interacts; they remain indeterminate for the rest of the universe.","At the precise moment when heat is produced, the process is irreversible: the past differs from the future. It is always heat and only heat that distinguishes the past from the future.This is universal. A burning candle is transformed into smoke, the smoke cannot transform into a candle-and a candle produces heat. A boiling hot cup of tea cools down and does not heat up: it diffuses heat. We live and get old: producing heat through friction.","the sun is using up its combustible hydrogen and will eventually exhaust it and extinguish. The sun too is getting older, and in fact produces heat. The moon also appears to orbit Earth unchangingly and always equal to itself, whereas in reality it is slowly moving away. This is because it raises tides, and the tides heat the sea a little, thus exchanging energy with the moon.","But on the moon, the duration of the \\"extended present\\" is a few seconds, and on Mars it is a quarter of an hour. This means we can say that on Mars there are events that in this precise moment have already happened, events that are yet to happen, but also a quarter-of-an-hour of events during which things occur that are neither in our past nor in our future.","Einstein predicted that time passes more quickly high up than below, nearer to Earth. This was measured and turned out to be the case. If a person who has lived at sea level meets up with his twin who has lived in the mountains, he will find that his sibling is slightly older than he. And this is just the beginning.","the \u201csingularity that classic general relativity anticipated disappears as soon as we take quantum gravity into account.\u201d","But the effective way of continuing to exist in a changing environment is to better manage correlations with the external world, that is to say, information: to collect, store, transmit, and elaborate information. For this reason DNA exists, together wih immune systems, sense organs, nervous systems, comolex brains, languages, books, the library of Alexandria, computers and Wikipedia: they maximize the efficiency of information management. The management of correlations favoring survival.","The notions of fields and particles, separated by Faraday and Maxwell, end up merging in quantum mechanics.The way this happens in the theory is elegant: the equation of Dirac determines the values a variable can take. Applied to the energy of Faraday\'s lines, they tell us that this energy can take on only certain values and not others. Since the energy of the electromagnetic field can take on only certain values, the field behaves line a set of packets of energy. These are precisely the quanta of energy introduced by Planck and Einstein thirty years later. The circle closes, and the story is complete. The equations of the theory, written by Dirac, account for the granular nature of light, which Planck and Einstein had intuited.","It must not be claimed that anyone can sense time by itself apart from the movement of things. LUCRETIUS, De rerum natura1","There is not an \u2018I\u2019 and \u2018the neurons in my brain\u2019. They are the same thing.

The answer is that each element corresponds to one solution of the main equation of quantum mechanics. The whole of chemistry emerges from a single equation.","From communication to the basis of genetics; from thermodynamics to quantum mechanics; up to quantum gravity, the notion of information is gaining ground as a tool for understanding. The world should not be understood as an amorphous ensemble of atoms-but rather as a game of mirrors, founded on the correlations between the structures formed by combinations of these atoms.","Our moral values, our emotions, our loves are no less real for being part of nature, for being shared with the animal world, or fore being determined by the evolution that our species has undergone over millions of years. Rather, they are more valuable as a result of this: they are real.","As human beings, we live by emotions and thoughts. We exchange them when we are in the same place at the same time, talking to each other, looking into each other\u2019s eyes, brushing against each other\u2019s skin. We are nourished by this network of encounters and exchanges. But, in reality, we do not need to be in the same place and time to have such exchanges. Thoughts and emotions that create bonds of attachment between us have no difficulty in crossing seas and decades, sometimes even centuries, tied to thin sheets of paper or dancing between the microchips of a computer. We are part of a network that goes far beyond the few days of our lives and the few square meters that we tread.","The apparent determinism of the macroscopic world is due only to the fact that the microscopic randomness cancels out on average, leaving only fluctuations too minute for us to perceive in everyday life.","Loop theory describes this atomic and granular quantum structure of space in a precise mathematical form. It is obtained by applying the general equations of quantum mechanics written by Dirac to Einstein\'s gravitational field.In particular, loop theory specifies that volume (for example the volume of a given cube) cannot be arbitrarily small. A minimum volume exists. No space smaller than this minimum volume exists. There is a minimum \\"quantum\\" of volume: an elementary atom of space.","Non c\u2019\xe8 pi\xf9 lo spazio che \xabcontiene\xbb il mondo e non c\u2019\xe8 pi\xf9 il tempo \xablungo il quale\xbb avvengono gli eventi.

L\u2019illusione dello spazio e del tempo continui attorno a noi \xe8 la visione sfocata di questo fitto pullulare di processi elementari.","Another way of posing the problem is to ask oneself: what is the \u201cpresent? We say that only the things of the present exist: the past no longer exists and the future doesn\u2019t exist yet. But in physics there is nothing that corresponds to the notion of the \u201cnow.\u201d Compare \u201cnow\u201d with \u201chere.\u201d \u201cHere\u201d designates the place where a speaker is: for two different people \u201chere\u201d points to two different places. Consequently \u201chere\u201d is a word the meaning of which depends on where it is spoken. The technical term for this kind of utterance is \u201cindexical.\u201d \u201cNow\u201d also points to the instant in which the word is uttered and is also classed as \u201cindexical.\u201d But no one would dream of saying that things \u201chere\u201d exist, whereas things that are not \u201chere\u201d do not exist. So then why do we say that things that are \u201cnow\u201d exist and that everything else doesn\u2019t? Is the present something that is objective in the world, that \u201cflows,\u201d and that makes things \u201cexist\u201d one after the other, or is it only subjective, like \u201chere\u201d? This may seem like an abstruse mental problem. But modern physics has made it into a burning issue, since special relativity has shown that the notion of the \u201cpresent\u201d is also subjective. Physicists and philosophers have come to the conclusion that the idea of a present that is common to the whole universe is an illusion and that the universal \u201cflow\u201d of time is a generalization that doesn\u2019t work. When his great Italian friend Michele Besso died, Einstein wrote a moving letter to Michele\u2019s sister: \u201cMichele has left this strange world a little before me. This means nothing. People like us, who believe in physics, know that the distinction made between past, present and future is nothing more than a persistent, stubborn illusion.\u201d Illusion or not, what explains the fact that for us time \u201cruns,\u201d \u201cflows,\u201d \u201cpasses\u201d? The passage of time is obvious to us all: our thoughts and our speech exist in time; the very structure of our language requires time\u2014a thing \u201cis\u201d or \u201cwas\u201d or \u201cwill be.\u201d It is possible to imagine a world without colors, without matter, even without space, but it\u2019s difficult to imagine one without time. The German philosopher Martin Heidegger emphasized our \u201cdwelling in time.\u201d Is it possible that the flow of time that Heidegger treats as primal is absent from descriptions of the world? Some\u201d","Things are transformed one into another according to necessity, and render justice to one another according to the order of time.","The nature of man is not his internal structure but the network of personal, familial, and social interactions within which he exists. It is these that \\"make\\" us, these that guard us. As humans, we are that which others know of us, that which we know of ourselves, and that which others know about our knowledge. We are complex nodes in a rich web of reciprocal information.","The electromagnetic waves are vibrations of Faraday\'s lines, but also, at small scale, swarms of photons. When they interact with something else, as in the photoelectric effect, they manifest themselves as particles: on our eyes, light rains in separate droplets, in single photons. Photons are the \\"quanta\\" of the electromagnetic field.But the electrons and all the other particles of which the world is made are equally \\"quanta\\" of a field! A \\"quantum field\\" similar to Faraday and Maxwell\'s, subject to granularity and to quantum probability. Dirac writes the equations for the field of the electrons and of the other elementary particles. The sharp distinction between fields and particles introduced by Faraday vanishes.","The world of quantum mechanics is not a world of objects: it is a world of events.","Einstein wrote an equation that says that R is equivalent to the energy of matter. That is to say: space curves where there is matter. That is it. The equation fits into half a line, and there is nothing more. A vision\u2014that space curves\u2014became an equation.","Einstein\u2019s equation shows that space cannot stand still; it must be expanding. In 1930 the expansion of the universe was actually observed.","All of this is the result of an elementary intuition: that space and gravitational field are the same thing.","If more gently than Orpheus who moved even the trees you were to pluck the zither the life-blood would not return to the vain shadow . . .
