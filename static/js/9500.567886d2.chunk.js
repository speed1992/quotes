It would be better to live under robber barons than under omnipotent moral busybodies. The robber baron\'s cruelty may sometimes sleep, his cupidity may at some point be satiated; but those who torment us for our own good will torment us without end for they do so with the approval of their own conscience.","Life with God is not immunity from difficulties, but peace in difficulties.","The greatest evils in the world will not be carried out by men with guns, but by men in suits sitting behind desks","Once people stop believing in God, the problem is not that they will believe in nothing; rather, the problem is that they will believe anything.","Don\'t shine so that others can see you. Shine so that through you, others can see HIM.","One of the most cowardly things ordinary people do is to shut their eyes to facts.","Humility is not thinking less of yourself, it\'s thinking of yourself less.","Hardship often prepares an ordinary person for an extraordinary destiny.","There is someone that I love even though I don\'t approve of what he does. There is someone I accept though some of his thoughts and actions revolt me. There is someone I forgive though he hurts the people I love the most. That person is......me.","I believe in Christianity as I believe that the sun has risen: not only because I see it, but because by it I see everything else.","We must stop regarding unpleasant or unexpected things as interruptions of real life. The truth is that interruptions are real life.","If nothing in this world satisfies me, perhaps it is because I was made for another world.","If you never take risks, you\'ll never accomplish great things. Everybody dies, but not everyone has lived.","Integrity is doing the right thing, even when no one is watching.","The fact that our heart yearns for something Earth can\'t supply is proof that Heaven must be our home.","There are two kinds of love: we love wise and kind and beautiful people because we need them, but we love (or try to love) stupid and disagreeable people because they need us. This second kind is the more divine because that is how God loves us: not because we are lovable but because He is love, not because He needs to receive but He delights to give.","Getting over a painful experience is much like crossing monkey bars. You have to let go at some point in order to move forward.","Isn\'t it funny how day by day nothing changes, but when you look back, everything is different.","Don\'t judge a man by where he is, because you don\'t know how far he has come.","You don\'t have a soul. You are a Soul. You have a body.","I didn\u2019t go to religion to make me happy. I always knew a bottle of Port would do that. If you want a religion to make you feel really comfortable, I certainly don\u2019t recommend Christianity.","Don\'t let your happiness depend on something you may lose.","The most dangerous ideas in a society are not the ones being argued, but the ones that are assumed.","God allows us to experience the low points of life in order to teach us lessons that we could learn in no other way.","Education without values, as useful as it is, seems rather to make man a more clever devil.","We all agree that forgiveness is a beautiful idea until we have to practice it.","Atheists express their rage against God although in their view He does not exist.","I suggest to you that it is because God loves us that he gives us the gift of suffering. Pain is God\'s megaphone to rouse a deaf world. You see, we are like blocks of stone out of which the Sculptor carves the forms of men. The blows of his chisel, which hurt us so much are what make us perfect.","To love at all is to be vulnerable. Love anything and your heart will be wrung and possibly broken. If you want to make sure of keeping it intact you must give it to no one, not even an animal. Wrap it carefully round with hobbies and little luxuries; avoid all entanglements. Lock it up safe in the casket or coffin of your selfishness. But in that casket, safe, dark, motionless, airless, it will change. It will not be broken; it will become unbreakable, impenetrable, irredeemable. To love is to be vulnerable.","Love is never wasted, for its value does not rest upon reciprocity.","If you live for the next world, you get this one in the deal; but if you live only for this world, you lose them both.","A sign of a culture that has lost its faith - Moral collapse follows upon spiritual collapse.","I pray because I can\'t help myself. I pray because I\'m helpless. It doesn\'t change God - it changes me.","Those who do not think about their own sins make up for it by thinking incessantly about the sins of others.","There are two kinds of people: those who say to God, \'Thy will be done,\' and those to whom God says, \'All right, then, have it your way.\'","Of all tyrannies a tyranny sincerely exercised for the good of its victims may be the most oppressive.","You must make your choice: either this man was, and is, the Son of God, or else a madman or something worse. You can shut him up for a fool, you can spit at him and kill him as a demon; or you can fall at his feet and call him Lord and God. But let us not come with any patronizing nonsense about his being a great human teacher. He has not left that open to us. He did not intend to.","We all want progress, but if you\'re on the wrong road, progress means doing an about-turn and walking back to the right road; in that case, the man who turns back soonest is the most progressive.","God doesn\'t want something from us. He simply wants us.","Life is too deep for words, so don\'t try to describe it, just live it.","Friendship is the instrument by which God reveals to each of us the beauties of others.","We must picture Hell as a state where everyone is perpetually concerned about his own dignity and advancement, where everyone has a grievance, and where everyone lives the deadly serious passions of envy, self-importance, and resentment.","In such a fearful world, we need a fearless church","A proud man is always looking down on things and people; and, of course, as long as you are looking down, you cannot see something that is above you.","Christianity, if false, is of no importance, and if true, of infinite importance. The only thing it cannot be is moderately important.","We meet no ordinary people in our lives.","The more we let God take us over, the more truly ourselves we become - because He made us. He invented us. He invented all the different people that you and I were intended to be. . .It is when I turn to Christ, when I give up myself to His personality, that I first begin to have a real personality of my own.","After each failure, ask forgiveness, pick yourself up, and try again. Very often what God first helps us toward is not the virtue itself but just this power of always trying again. For however important chastity (or courage, or truthfulness, or any other virtue) may be, this process trains us in habits of the soul which are more important still. It cures our illusions about ourselves and teaches us to depend on God. We learn, on the one hand, that we cannot trust ourselves even in our best moments, and, on the other, that we need not despair even in our worst, for our failures are forgiven.","If a thing is free to be good it is also free to be bad. And free will is what has made evil possible. Why, then, did God give them free will? Because free will, though it makes evil possible, is also the only thing that makes possible any love or goodness or joy worth having.","To be a Christian means to forgive the inexcusable because God has forgiven the inexcusable in you.","I think that if God forgives us we must forgive ourselves. Otherwise, it is almost like setting up ourselves as a higher tribunal than Him.","There are far, far better things ahead than any we leave behind.","If conversion to Christianity makes no improvement in a man\'s outward actions \u2013 if he continues to be just a snobbish or spiteful or envious or ambitious as he was before \u2013 then I think we must suspect that his \'conversion\' was largely imaginary.","If you read history you will find that the Christians who did most for the present world were precisely those who thought most of the next. It is since Christians have largely ceased to think of the other world that they have become so ineffective in this.","God gives His gifts where He finds the vessel empty enough to receive them.","On the back of Satan\'s neck is a nail scarred footprint.","Evil comes from the ABUSE of free will","Christ says, \'Give me all. I don\'t want so much of your time and so much of your money and so much of your work: I want you....Hand over the whole natural self, all the desires which you think innocent as well as the ones you think wicked- the whole outfit. I will give you a new self instead. In fact, I will give you myself: my own will shall become yours.","Since it is so likely that (children) will meet cruel enemies, let them at least have heard of brave knights and heroic courage. Otherwise you are making their destiny not brighter but darker.","Relying on God has to begin all over again every day as if nothing had yet been done.","You find out the strength of a wind by trying to walk against it, not by lying down.","For pride is spiritual cancer: it eats up the very possibility of love, or contentment, or even common sense.","I gave up Christianity at about 14. Came back to it when getting on for 30. Not an emotional conversion; almost purely philosophical. I didn\'t want to. I\'m not in the least a religious type. I want to be let alone, to feel I\'m my own master; but since the facts seemed to be just the opposite, I had to give in.","The descent to hell is easy and those who begin by worshipping power, soon worship evil.","The Christian does not think God will love us because we are good, but that God will make us good because He loves us.","Enemy-occupied territory---that is what this world is. Christianity is the story of how the rightful king has landed, you might say landed in disguise, and is calling us to take part in a great campaign of sabotage.","You cannot make men good by law: and without good men you cannot have a good society.","Mental pain is less dramatic than physical pain, but it is more common and also more hard to bear. The frequent attempt to conceal mental pain increases the burden: it is easier to say \u201cMy tooth is aching\u201d than to say \u201cMy heart is broken.","Never, in peace or war, commit your virtue or your happiness to the future. Happy work is best done by the man who takes his long-term plans somewhat lightly and works from moment to moment \'as to the Lord.\' It is only our daily bread that we are encouraged to ask for. The present is the only time in which any duty can be done or any grace received.","To forgive the incessant provocations of daily life - to keep on forgiving the bossy mother-in-law, the bullying husband, the nagging wife, the selfish daughter, the deceitful son - how can we do it? Only, I think, by remembering where we stand, by meaning our words when we say in our prayers each night, \u201cForgive our trespasses as we forgive those who trespass against us.\u201d We are offered forgiveness on no other terms. To refuse it is to refuse God\u2019s mercy for ourselves. There is no hint of exceptions and God means what he says.","Of course God does not consider you hopeless. If He did He would not be moving you to seek Him (and He obviously is). What is going on in you at present is simply the beginning of the treatment. Continue seeking with cheerful seriousness. Unless He wanted you, you would not be wanting Him.","He (the devil) always sends errors into the world in pairs--pairs of opposites...He relies on your extra dislike of one to draw you gradually into the opposite one. But do not let us be fooled. We have to keep our eyes on the goal and go straight through between both errors. We have no other concern than that with either of them.","God loves us NOT because we\'re lovable, because He is love. Not because He needs to receive, because He delights to give.","It would seem that Our Lord finds our desires not too strong, but too weak. We are half-hearted creatures, fooling about with drink and sex and ambition when infinite joy is offered us, like an ignorant child who wants to go on making mud pies in a slum because he cannot imagine what is meant by the offer of a holiday at the sea. We are far too easily pleased.","Everything that is not eternal is worthless in eternity.","You never know what you can do until you try, and very few try unless they have to.","If you think of this world as a place intended simply for our happiness, you find it quite intolerable: think of it as a place of training and correction and it\'s not so bad.","The more pride we have, the more other people\u2019s pride irritates us","The great thing to remember is that though our feelings come and go God\'s love for us does not.","Nothing is really ours until we share it.","You must be asking which door is the true one; not which pleases you best","Love is more than an emotion, it is a decision.","Whenever you are fed up with life, start writing: ink is the great cure for all human ills, as I have found out long ago.","God knows our situation; He will not judge us as if we had no difficulties to overcome. What matters is the sincerity and perseverance of our will to overcome them.","There is no neutral ground in the universe. Every square inch, every split second is claimed by God, and counterclaimed by Satan.","We have a strange illusion that mere time cancels sin. I have heard others, and I have heard myself, recounting cruelties and falsehoods committed in boyhood as if they were no concern of the present speaker\'s, and even with laughter. But mere time does nothing either to the fact or to the guilt of a sin. The guilt is washed out not by time but by repentance and the blood of Christ: if we have repented these early sins we should remember the price of our forgiveness and be humble.","Where men are forbidden to honour a king, they honor millionaires, athletes, or film stars instead; even famous prostitutes or gangsters. For spiritual nature, like bodily nature, will be served; deny it food and it will gobble poison.","Pain insists upon being attended to. God whispers to us in our pleasures, speaks in our consciences, but shouts in our pains. It is his megaphone to rouse a deaf world.","If Christianity was something we were making up, of course we could make it easier. But it is not.","God, in the end, gives people what they most want, including freedom from himself. What could be more fair?","Friendship is the greatest of worldly goods. Certainly to me it is the chief happiness of life. If I had to give a piece of advice to a young man about a place to live, I think I should say, \'sacrifice almost everything to live where you can be near your friends.\'","God wants a child\'s heart and a grownup\'s head.","Aristotle said that some people were only fit to be slaves. I do not contradict him. But I reject slavery because I see no men fit to be masters.","God cannot give us a happiness and peace apart from Himself, because it is not there. There is no such thing.","Good and evil both increase at compound interest. That is why the little decisions you and I make every day are of such infinite importance. The smallest good act today is the capture of a strategic point from which, a few months later, you may be able to go on to victories you never dreamed of. An apparently trivial indulgence in lust or anger today is the loss of a ridge or railway line or bridgehead from which the enemy may launch an attack otherwise impossible.","When I have learned to love God better than my earthly dearest, I shall love my earthly dearest better than I do now.","First, I do not sit down at my desk to put into verse something that is already clear in my mind. If it were clear in my mind, I should have no incentive or need to write about it. We do not write in order to be understood; we write in order to understand.","Whenever we find that our religious life is making us feel that we are good - above all, that we are better than someone else - I think we may be sure that we are being acted on, not by God, but by the devil.","Forgiveness does not mean excusing.","Love as distinct from \\"being in love\\" is not merely a feeling. It is a deep unity, maintained by the will and deliberately strengthened by habit.","I am sure that God keeps no one waiting unless he sees that it is good for him to wait.","A man who was merely a man and said the sort of things Jesus said wouldn\'t be a great moral teacher. He\'d be either a lunatic on a level with a man who says he\'s a poached egg or else he\'d be the devil of hell. You must make your choice. Either this man was, and is, the Son of God, or else a madman or something worse.","The holier a man becomes, the more he mourns over the unholiness which remains in him.","When I became a man I put away childish things, including the fear of childishness and the desire to be very grown up.","True friends don\u2019t spend time gazing into each other\u2019s eyes. They may show great tenderness towards each other but they face in the same direction - toward common projects, goals - above all, towards a common Lord.","Do not waste time bothering whether you \u2018love\u2019 your neighbor; act as if you did. As soon as we do this we find one of the great secrets. When you are behaving as if you loved someone, you will presently come to love him.","A Christian is not a man who never goes wrong, but a man who is enabled to repent.","If you love deeply, you\'re going to get hurt badly. But it\'s still worth it.","I can\'t imagine a man really enjoying a book and reading it only once.","We never find out the strength of the evil impulse inside us until we try to fight it.","God, who foresaw your tribulation, has specially armed you to go through it, not without pain but without stain.","A clever arrangement of bad eggs will never make a good omelet.","The Christian is in a different position from other people who are trying to be good. They hope, by being good, to please God if there is one; or \u2014 if they think there is not \u2014 at least they hope to deserve approval from good men. But the Christian thinks any good he does comes from the Christ-life inside him. He does not think God will love us because we are good, but that God will make us good because He loves us; just as the roof of a greenhouse does not attract the sun because it is bright, but becomes bright because the sun shines on it.","There are a dozen views about everything until you know the answer. Then there\'s never more than one.","If you have really handed yourself over to Him, it must follow that you are trying to obey Him. But trying in a new way, a less worried way.","Has this world been so kind to you that you should leave with regret? There are better things ahead than any we leave behind.","Christianity asserts that every individual human being is going to live for ever, and this must be either true or false. Now there are a good many things which would not be worth bothering about if I were going to live only seventy years, but which I had better bother about very seriously if I am going to live for ever.","And there, right in the middle of it, I find \'Forgive us our sins as we forgive those that sin against us.\' There is no slightest suggestion that we are offered forgiveness on any other terms. It is made perfectly clear that if we do not forgive we shall not be forgiven.","But the great thing to remember is that, though our feelings come and go, His love for us does not. It is not wearied by our sins, or our indifference; and, therefore, it is quite relentless in its determination that we shall be cured of those sins, at whatever cost to us, at whatever cost to Him.","We are not merely imperfect creatures who must be improved; we are rebels who must lay down our arms.","Friends are like coals in a fire - together, they glow; apart, they grow cold.","When we Christians behave badly, or fail to behave well, we are making Christianity unbelievable to the outside world","He died not for men, but for each man. If each man had been the only man made, He would have done no less.","If we only have the will to walk, then God is pleased with our stumbles.","In Gethsemane the holiest of all petitioners prayed three times that a certain cup might pass from Him. It did not.","Never, never pin your whole faith on any human being: not if he is the best and wisest in the whole world. There are lots of nice things you can do with sand; but do not try building a house on it.","What we learn from experience depends on the kind of philosophy we bring to experience.","Provocation doesn\'t make me ill-tempered: it only shows me how ill-tempered I am.","The moment you wake up each morning, all your wishes and hopes for the day rush at you like wild animals. And the first job each morning consists in shoving it all back; in listening to that other voice, taking that other point of view, letting that other, larger, stronger, quieter life come flowing in.","Most people don\'t need to be taught, they need only to be reminded","Democracy demands that little men should not take big ones too seriously; it dies when it is full of little men who think they are big themselves.","An explanation of cause is not a justification by reason.","The homemaker has the ultimate career. All other careers exist for one purpose only - and that is to support the ultimate career.","The perfect church service would be one we were almost unaware of. Our attention would have been on God.","I have discovered that the people who believe most strongly in the next life do the most good in the present one.","Prayer does not change God; it changes me.","If you are a Christian, you are free to think that all these religions, even the queerest ones, contain at least some hint of the truth.","Seek Unity and you will find neither Unity nor Truth.Seek the light of truth, and you will find Unity and Truth.","The next best thing to being wise oneself is to live in a circle of those who are.","The world does not consist of 100 percent Christians and 100 percent non-Christians. There are people (a great many of them) who are slowly ceasing to be Christians but who still call themselves by that name: some of them are clergymen. There are other people who are slowly becoming Christians though they do not yet call themselves so.","God whispers in our pleasures, but shouts in our pain.","Obedience is the key that opens every door.","I know now, Lord, why you utter no answer. You are yourself the answer. Before your face questions die away. What other answer would suffice?","True humility is more like self-forgetfulness than false modesty.","Much is expected from those to whom much is given.","Christianity seems at first to be all about morality, all about duties and rules and guilt and virtue, yet it leads you on, out of all that, into something beyond. One has a glimpse of a country where they do not talk of those things, except perhaps as a joke. Every one there is filled full with what we should call goodness as a mirror is filled with light. But they do not call it goodness. They do not call it anything. They are not thinking of it. They are too busy looking at the source from which it comes.","The monstrosity of sexual intercourse outside marriage is that those who indulge in it are trying to isolate one kind of union (the sexual) from all the other kinds of union which were intended to go along with it and make up the total union.","To have Faith in Christ means, of course, trying to do all that He says. There would be no sense in saying you trusted a person if you would not take his advice.","It is quite useless knocking at the door of heaven for earthly comfort. It\'s not the sort of comfort they supply there.","Whatever you do, He will make good of it. But not the good He had prepared for you if you had obeyed him.","Love is something more stern and splendid than mere kindness.","I\'m not sure God wants us to be happy. I think he wants us to love, and be loved. But we are like children, thinking our toys will make us happy and the whole world is our nursery. Something must drive us out of that nursery and into the lives of others, and that something is suffering.","A man can\'t be taken to hell, or sent to hell: you can only get there on your own steam.","And out of that hopeless attempt has come nearly all that we call human history\u2014money, poverty, ambition, war, prostitution, classes, empires, slavery\u2014the long terrible story of man trying to find something other than God which will make him happy.","We may ignore, but we can nowhere evade the presence of God. The world is crowded with Him. He walks everywhere incognito.","God made us: invented us as a man invents an engine. A car is made to run on petrol, and it would not run properly on anything else. Now God designed the human machine to run on Himself.","A man can no more diminish God\'s glory by refusing to worship Him than a lunatic can put out the sun by scribbling the word, \'darkness\' on the walls of his cell.","The real problem is not why some pious, humble, believing people suffer, but why some do not.","The sweetest thing in all my life has been the longing \u2014 to reach the Mountain, to find the place where all the beauty came from \u2014 my country, the place where I ought to have been born. Do you think it all meant nothing, all the longing? The longing for home? For indeed it now feels not like going, but like going back.","He that but looketh on a plate of ham and eggs to lust after it hath already committed breakfast with it in his heart","It is not your business to succeed, but to do right. When you have done so the rest lies with god.","God became man to turn creatures into sons: not simply to produce better men of the old kind but to produce a new kind of man. It is not like teaching a horse to jump better and better but like turning a horse into a winged creature.","In commanding us to glorify Him, God is inviting us to enjoy Him.","Friends are seldom found; they are made.","I believe in Christianity as I believe the sun has risen, not only because I see it, but because by it I see everything else.","I have learned now that while those who speak about one\'s miseries usually hurt, those who keep silence hurt more.","A cold, self-righteous prig who goes regularly to church may be far nearer to Hell than a prostitute.","We have to be continually reminded of what we believe. Neither this belief nor any other will automatically remain alive in the mind. It must be fed.","When you come to knowing God, the initiative lies on His side. If He does not show Himself, nothing you can do will enable you to find Him. And, in fact, He shows much more of Himself to some people than to others\u2014not because He has favourites, but because it is impossible for Him to show Himself to a man whose whole mind and character are in the wrong condition. Just as sunlight, though it has no favourites, cannot be reflected in a dusty mirror as clearly as in a clean one.","When you argue against Him you are arguing against the very power that makes you able to argue at all: it is like cutting off the branch you are sitting on.","Besides being complicated, reality, in my experience, is usually odd. It is not neat, not obvious, not what you expect.","Now repentance is no fun at all. It is something much harder than merely eating humble pie. It means unlearning all the self-conceit and self-will that we have been training ourselves into for thousands of years. It means undergoing a kind of death. In fact, it needs a good man to repent. And here\'s the catch. Only a bad person needs to repent: only a good person can repent perfectly. The worse you are the more you need it and the less you can do it. The only person who could do it perfectly would be a perfect person - and he would not need it.","No mind is so good that it does not need another mind to counter and equal it, and to save it from conceit and bigotry and folly","Humility is self-forgetfulness.","Heaven is reality itself. All that is fully real is Heavenly. For all that can be shaken will be shaken and only the unshakeable remains.","Christ says, \'Give me all. I don\'t want so much of your time and so much of your money and so much of your work: I want You.\'","History is a story written by the finger of God.","I need Christ, not something that resembles Him.","When we lose one blessing, another is often most unexpectedly given in its place.","Spiteful words can hurt your feelings but silence breaks your heart.","You never know how much you really believe anything until its truth or falsehood becomes a matter of life and death to you.","All that are in Hell, choose it. Without that self-choice there could be no Hell.","Love may forgive all infirmities and love still in spite of them: but Love cannot cease to will their removal.","The question is not what we intended ourselves to be, but what He intended us to be when He made us.","Many things have gone wrong with the world that God made and... God insists, and insists very loudly, on our putting them right again","There are no ordinary people. You have never talked to a mere mortal. Nations, cultures, arts, civilizations - these are mortal, and their life is to ours as the life of a gnat. But it is immortals whom we joke with, work with, marry, snub and exploit - immortal horrors or everlasting splendors. This does not mean that we are to be perpetually solemn. We must play. But our merriment must be of that kind (and it is, in fact, the merriest kind) which exists between people who have, from the outset, taken each other seriously - no flippancy, no superiority, no presumption.","The Church exists for nothing else but to draw men into Christ, to make them little Christs. If they are not doing that, all the cathedrals, clergy, missions, sermons, even the Bible itself, are simply a waste of time. God became Man for no other purpose.","Our Heavenly Father has provided many delightful inns for us along our journey, but he takes great care to see that we do not mistake any of them for home.","Keep clear of psychiatrists unless you know that they are also Christians. Otherwise they start with the assumption that your religion is an illusion and try to \'cure\' it: and this assumption they make not as professional psychologists but as amateur philosophers.","I must keep alive in myself the desire for my true country, which I shall not find till after death.","Faith in Christ is the only thing to save you from despair.","We are not meant to be perpetually solemn: We must play.","Fallen man is not simply an imperfect creature who needs improvement: he is a rebel who must lay down his arms.","The doors of hell are locked from the inside!","...here also forgiving does not mean excusing. Many people seem to think it does. They think that if you ask them to forgive someone who has cheated or bullied them you are trying to make out that there was really no cheating or bullying. But if that were so, there would be nothing to forgive. (This doesn\'t mean that you must necessarily believe his next promise. It does mean that you must make every effort to kill every taste of resentment in your own heart - every wish to humiliate or hurt him or to pay him out.)","We do not see into men\u2019s hearts. We cannot judge, and are indeed forbidden to judge.","There is but one good; that is God. Everything else is good when it looks to Him and bad when it turns from Him.","In Science we have been reading only the notes to a poem; in Christianity we find the poem itself.","It costs God nothing, so far as we know, to create nice things: but to convert rebellious wills cost Him crucifixion.","For a long time I used to think this a silly, straw-splitting distinction: how could you hate what a man did and not hate the man? But years later it occurred to me that there was one man to whom I had been doing this all my life - namely myself.","The salvation of a single soul is more important than the production or preservation of all the epics and tragedies in the world.","Obedience is the road to freedom.","You can be good for the mere sake of goodness; you cannot be bad for the mere sake of badness. You can do a kind action when you are not feeling kind and when it gives you no pleasure, simply because kindness is right; but no one ever did a cruel action simply because cruelty is wrong - only because cruelty is pleasant or useful to him, In other words, badness cannot succeed even in being bad in the same way in which goodness is good. Goodness is, so to speak, itself: badness is only spoiled goodness. And there must be something good first before it can be spoiled.","Good people know about both good and evil: bad people do not know about either.","If anyone would like to acquire humility, the first step is to realize one is proud. Nothing can be done before it.","We are not necessarily doubting that God will do the best for us; we are wondering how painful the best will turn out to be.","When a man is getting better he understands more and more clearly the evil that is still left in him. When a man is getting worse he understands his own badness less and less.","Love is unselfishly choosing for another\'s highest good.","We shall draw nearer to God, not by trying to avoid the sufferings inherent in all loves, but by accepting them and offering them to Him; throwing away all defensive armour. If our hearts need to be broken, and if He chooses this as the way in which they should break, so be it.","My argument against God was that the universe seemed so cruel and unjust. But how had I got this idea of just and unjust? A man does not call a line crooked unless he has some idea of a straight line. What was I comparing this universe with when I called it unjust?","There are two equal and opposite errors into which our race can fall about the devils. One is to disbelieve in their existence. The other is to believe, and to feel an excessive and unhealthy interest in them. They themselves are equally pleased by both errors and hail a materialist or a magician with the same delight.","Aim at heaven and you will get earth thrown in. Aim at earth and you get neither.","The most dangerous thing you can do is to take any one impulse of your own nature and set it up as the thing you ought to follow at all costs.","I gave in, and admitted that God was God.","If we discover a desire within us that nothing in this world can satisfy, also we should begin to wonder if perhaps we were created for another world.","The problem of reconciling human suffering with the existence of a God who loves, is only insoluble so long as we attach a trivial meaning to the word \\"love\\", and look on things as if man were the centre of them. Man is not the centre. God does not exist for the sake of man. Man does not exist for his own sake. \\"Thou hast created all things, and for thy pleasure they are and were created.\\" We were made not primarily that we may love God (though we were made for that too) but that God may love us, that we may become objects in which the divine love may rest \\"well pleased\\".","I have seen great beauty of spirit in some who were great sufferers. I have seen men, for the most part, grow better not worse with advancing years, and I have seen the last illness produce treasures of fortitude and meekness from most unpromising subjects.","We do not come to God as bad people trying to become good people; we come as rebels to lay down our arms.","I was not born to be free---I was born to adore and obey.","Whether we like it or not, God intends to give us what we need, not what we now think we want","Christ, who said to the disciples, \'You have not chosen me, but I have chosen you,\' can truly say to every group of Christian friends, \'You have not chosen one another but I have chosen you for one another.\'","The humblest praise most, while cranks & malcontents praise least. Praise almost seems to be inner health made audible","Every Christian would agree that a man\'s spiritual health is exactly proportional to his love for God.","The real test of being in the presence of God is, that you either forget about yourself altogether or see yourself as a small, dirty object.","What you see and what you hear depends a great deal on where you are standing. It also depends on what sort of person you are.","The Christian life is simply a process of having your natural self changed into a Christ self, and that this process goes on very far inside. One\'s most private wishes, one\'s point of view, are the things that have to be changed.","With my mother\'s death all settled happiness, all that was tranquil and reliable, disappeared from my life. There was to be much fun, many pleasures, many stabs of Joy; but no more of the old security. It was sea and islands now; the great continent had sunk like Atlantis.","The great thing, if one can, is to stop regarding all the unpleasant things as interruptions of one\'s \'own,\' or \'real\' life. The truth is of course that what one calls the interruptions are precisely one\'s real life -- the life God is sending one day by day.","You may forget that you are at every moment totally dependent on God.","If you want to get warm you must stand near the fire: if you want to be wet you must get into the water. If you want joy, power, peace, eternal life, you must get close to, or even into, the thing that has them. They are not a sort of prize which God could, if He chose, just hand out to anyone.","Put first things first and we get second things thrown in: put second things first & we lose both first and second things.","We can never know what might have been but what is to come is another matter entirely","I think we all sin by needlessly disobeying the apostolic injunction to \\"rejoice\\" as much as by anything else","The Life-Force is a sort of tame God. You can switch it on when you want, but it will not bother you. All the thrills of religion and none of the cost. Is the Life-Force the greatest achievement of wishful thinking the world has yet seen?","I find that when I think I am asking God to forgive me I am often in reality. . . asking Him not to forgive me but to excuse me.","A great many of those who \'debunk\' traditional...values have in the background values of their own which they believe to be immune from the debunking process","When we are wholly His we will be more ourselves than ever.","I want God, not my idea of God.","A man does not call a line crooked unless he has some idea of a straight line.","Holy places are dark places. It is life and strength, not knowledge and words, that we get in them. Holy wisdom is not clear and thin like water, but thick and dark like blood.","[To have Faith in Christ] means, of course, trying to do all that He says. There would be no sense in saying you trusted a person if you would not take his advice. Thus if you have really handed yourself over to Him, it must follow that you are trying to obey Him. But trying in a new way, a less worried way. Not doing these things in order to be saved, but because He has begun to save you already. Not hoping to get to Heaven as a reward for your actions, but inevitably wanting to act in a certain way because a first faint gleam of Heaven is already inside you.","I am often, I believe, praying for others when I should be doing things for them. It\'s so much easier to pray for a bore than to go and see him.","Have fun, even if it\u2019s not the same kind of fun everyone else is having.","I don\'t pray so that I can change God. I pray so that God can change me.","Through pride the devil became the devil. Pride leads to every vice, it\'s the complete anti-God state of mind.","Read and Re-Read--\\"Re-reading, we always find a new book.","The birth of Christ is the central event in the history of the earth-- the very thing the whole story has been about.","Miracles are a retelling in small letters of the very same story which is written across the whole world in letters too large for some of us to see.","We are what we believe we are.","Some people feel guilty about their anxieties and regard them as a defect of faith but they are afflictions, not sins. Like all afflictions, they are, if we can so take them, our share in the passion of Christ.","If you are really a product of a materialistic universe, how is it that you don\'t feel at home there?","Prostitutes are in no danger of finding their present life so satisfactory that they cannot turn to God: the proud, the avaricious, the self-righteous, are in that danger.","To love at all is to be vulnerable.","Regarding the debate about faith and works: It\'s like asking which blade in a pair of scissors is most important.","A real desire to believe all the good you can of others and to make others as comfortable as you can will solve most of the problems.","To love you as I should, I must worship God as Creator.","You\'ll never make a good impression on other people until you stop thinking what sort of impression you make.","It may be hard for an egg to turn into a bird: it would be a jolly sight harder for it to learn to fly while remaining an egg. We are like eggs at present. And you cannot go on indefinitely being just an ordinary, decent egg. We must be hatched or go bad.","Love may, indeed, love the beloved when her beauty is lost: but not because it is lost. Love may forgive all infirmities and love still in spite of them: but Love cannot cease to will their removal. Love is more sensitive than hatred itself to every blemish in the beloved\u2026 Of all powers he forgives most, but he condones least: he is pleased with little, but demands all.","What does not satisfy when we find it, was not the thing we were desiring.","It is wonderful what you can do when you have to.","Before we can be cured, we must want to be cured.","We forgive, we mortify our resentment; a week later some chain of thought carries us back to the original offence and we discover the old resentment blazing away as if nothing had been done about it at all. We need to forgive our brother seventy times seven not only for 490 offences but for one offence.","There have been men before who got so interested in proving the existence of God that they came to care nothing for God himself, as if the good Lord had nothing to do but to exist. There have been some who were so preoccupied with spreading Christianity that they never gave a thought to Christ.","It takes courage to live through suffering; and it takes honesty to observe it.","The sight of the huge world put mad ideas into me, as if I could wander away, wander forever, see strange and beautiful things, one after the other...","For the church is not a human society of people united by their natural affinities but the Body of Christ, in which all members, however different, (and He rejoices in their differences and by no means wishes to iron them out) must share the common life, complementing and helping one another precisely by their differences.","It is the magician\'s bargain: give up our soul, get power in return. But once our souls, that is, ourselves, have been given up, the power thus conferred will not belong to us. We shall in fact be the slaves and puppets of that to which we have given our souls.","Precisely because we cannot predict the moment, we must be ready at all moments.","You will not find the warrior, the poet, the philosopher or the Christian by staring into his eyes as if he were your mistress: better fight beside him, read with him, argue with him, pray with him.","Part of every misery is, so to speak, the misery\'s shadow or reflection: the fact that you don\'t merely suffer but have to keep on thinking about the fact that you suffer. I not only live each endless day in grief, but live each day thinking about living each day in grief.","You never know how much you really believe anything until its truth of falsehood becomes a matter of life and death to you. It is easy to say you believe a rope to be strong and sound as long as you are merely using it to cord a box. But suppose you had to hang by that rope over a precipice. Wouldn\'t you then first discover how much you really trusted it?","It is in the process of being worshipped that God communicates His presence to men.","A man whose life has been transformed by Christ cannot help but have his worldview show through.","The theory that thought is merely a movement in the brain is, in my opinion, nonsense; for if so, that theory itself would be merely a movement, an event among atoms, which may have speed and direction but of which it would be meaningless to use the words \'true\' or \'false\'.","You can\'t analyze God. He is too awesome, too big, too mysterious.","You thought you were being made into a decent little cottage but He is building a palace. He intends to come & live in it Himself","God will look to every soul like its first love because He is its first love.","The way for a person to develop a style is (a) to know exactly what he wants to say, and (b) to be sure he is saying exactly that.","Good philosophy must exist, if for no other reason, because bad philosophy needs to be answered.","If the whole universe has no meaning, we should never have found out that it has no meaning: just as, if there were no light in the universe and therefore no creatures with eyes, we should never know it was dark. Dark would be without meaning.","Mere change is not growth. Growth is the synthesis of change and continuity, and where there is no continuity there is no growth.","God has infinite attention, infinite leisure to spare for each one of us. He doesn\'t have to take us in the line. You\'re as much alone with Him as if you were the only thing He\'d ever created.","Do not dare not to dare.","Love, in the Christian sense, does not mean an emotion. It is a state not of the feelings but of the will; that state of the will which we have naturally about ourselves, and must learn to have about other people.","You would not have called to me unless I had been calling to you,\\" said the Lion.","Joy is the serious business of heaven.","God has infinite attention to spare for each one of us.","When you are not feeling particularly friendly but know you ought to be, the best thing you can do, very often, is to put on a friendly manner and behave as if you were a nicer person than you actually are. And in a few minutes, as we have all noticed, you will be really feeling friendlier than you were.","To every soul, God will look like its first love because He IS its first love. Your place in heaven will seem to be made for you and you alone, because you were made for it - made for it stitch by stitch as a glove is made for a hand.","A sum can be put right: but only by going back till you find the error and working it afresh from that point, never by simply going on.","Even in literature and art, no man who bothers about originality will ever be original: whereas if you simply try to tell the truth (without caring twopence how often it has been told before) you will, nine times out of ten, become original without ever having noticed it.","The value of the individual does not lie in him. He receives it by union with Christ.","The central Christian belief is that Christ\'s death has somehow put us right with God and given us a fresh start.","Our Father refreshes us on the journey with some pleasant inns, but will not encourage us to mistake them for home.","Man was appointed by God to have dominion over the beasts, and everything a man does to an animal is either a lawful exercise or a sacrilegious abuse of an authority by divine right.","Nothing less will shake a man \u2014 or at any rate a man like me \u2014 out of his merely verbal thinking and his merely notional beliefs. He has to be knocked silly before he comes to his senses. Only torture will bring out the truth. Only under torture does he discover it himself.","When we want to be something other than the thing God wants us to be, we must be wanting what, in fact, will not make us happy.","He who has God and everything else has no more than he who has God only.","Being in love is a good thing, but it is not the best thing. There are many things below it, but there are also things above it. You cannot make it the basis of a whole life. It is a noble feeling, but it is still a feeling. Now no feeling can be relied on to last in its full intensity, or even to last at all. Knowledge can last, principles can last, habits can last; but feelings come and go.","All human beings pass away. Do not let your happiness depend on something you may lose. If love is to be a blessing, not a misery, it must be for the only beloved who will never pass away.","The very condition of having Friends is that we should want something else besides Friends. Where the truthful answer to the question \\"Do you see the same truth?\\" would be \\"I see nothing and I don\'t care about the truth; I only want a Friend,\\" no Friendship can arise - though Affection of course may. There would be nothing for the Friendship to be about; and Friendship must be about something, even if it were only an enthusiasm for dominoes or white mice. Those who have nothing can share nothing; those who are going nowhere can have no fellow-travellers.","Surely what a man does when he is taken off guard is the best evidence for what sort of man he is. If there are rats in a cellar, you are most likely to see them if you go in very suddenly. But the suddenness does not create the rats; it only prevents them from hiding. In the same way the suddenness of the provocation does not make me ill tempered; it only shows me what an ill-tempered man I am.","Now is our chance to choose the right side. God is holding back to give us that chance. It won\'t last forever. We must take it or leave it.","There is one vice of which no man in the world is free; which every one in the world loathes when he sees it in someone else; and of which hardly any people, except Christians, ever imagine that they are guilty themselves. [\u2026] There is no fault which makes a man more unpopular, and no fault which we are more unconscious of in ourselves.[\u2026]The vice I am talking of is Pride or Self-Conceit: and the virtue opposite to it, in Christian morals, is called Humility.","Odd, the way the less the Bible is read the more it is translated","The happiness which God designs for His higher creatures is the happiness of being freely, voluntarily united to Him and to each other in an ecstasy of love and delight compared with which the most rapturous love between a man and a woman on this earth is mere milk and water. And for that they must be free.","Ambition! We must be careful what we mean by it. If it means the desire to get ahead of other people - which is what I think it does mean - then it is bad. If it means simply wanting to do a thing well, then it is good. It isn\'t wrong for an actor to want to act his part as well as it can possibly be acted, but the wish to have his name in bigger type than the other actors is a bad one.","Jesus produced mainly three effects: hatred, terror, adoration. There was no trace of people expressing mild approval.","\u200e\\"Don\'t bother too much about your feelings. When they are humble, loving, brave, give thanks for them; when they are conceited, selfish, cowardly, ask to have them altered. In neither case are they you, but only a thing that happens to you. What matters is your intentions and your behavior","Crying is all right in its way while it lasts. But you have to stop sooner or later, and then you still have to decide what to do.","In reality, moral rules are directions for running the human machine. Every moral rule is there to prevent a breakdown, or a strain, or a friction, in the running of that machine. That is why these rules at first seem to be constantly interfering with our natural inclinations.","Why love, if losing hurts so much? I have no answers anymore: only the life I have lived. Twice in that life I\'ve been given the choice: as a boy and as a man. The boy chose safety, the man chooses suffering. The pain now is part of the happiness then. That\'s the deal.","The Opposite of Love is not hate, but power","God is not a static thing...but a dynamic, pulsating activity, a life, almost a kind of drama. Almost, if you will not think me irreverent, a kind of dance.","Christ died for men precisely because men are not worth dying for; to make them worth it.","A perfect practice of Christianity would, of course, consist in a perfect imitation of the life of Christ -- I mean, in so far as it was applicable in one\'s own particular circumstance. Not in an idiotic sense -- it doesn\'t mean that every Christian should grow a beard, or be a bachelor, or become a travelling preacher. It means that every single act and feeling, every experience, whether pleasant or unpleasant, must be referred to God.","Repentance is not something God demands of you before He will take you back and which He could let you off if He chose; it is simply a description of what going back is like.","If the Church is not Making Disciples, then all the cathedrals, clergy, missions, sermons, even the Bible, are a waste of time.","I do not think that all who choose wrong roads perish; but their rescue consists in being put back on the right road. A sum can be put right: but only by going back til you find the error and working it afresh from that point, never by simply going on. Evil can be undone, but it cannot \'develop\' into good. Time does not heal it. The spell must be unwound, bit by bit, \'with backward mutters of dissevering power\' --or else not.","Look for yourself, and you will find in the long run only hatred, loneliness, despair, rage, ruin, and decay. But look for Christ and you will find Him, and with Him everything else thrown in.","A silly idea is current that good people do not know what temptation means. This is an obvious lie. Only those who try to resist temptation know how strong it is... A man who gives in to temptation after five minutes simply does not know what it would have been like an hour later. That is why bad people, in one sense, know very little about badness. They have lived a sheltered life by always giving in.","Christ offers something for nothing: He even offers everything for nothing.","I have received no assurance that anything we can do will eradicate suffering. I think the best results are obtained by people who work quietly away at limited objectives, such as the abolition of the slave trade, or prison reform, or factory acts, or tuberculosis, not by those who think they can achieve universal justice, or health, or peace. I think the art of life consists in tackling each immediate evil as well as we can.","Love...is not merely a feeling. It is a deep unity, maintained by the will and deliberately strengthened by habit; reinforced by (in Christian marriages) the grace which both partners ask, and receive, from God. They can have this love for each other even at those moments when they do not like each other; as you love yourself even when you do not like yourself.","The stamp of the Saint is that he can waive his own rights and obey the Lord Jesus.","If you look for truth, you may find comfort in the end; if you look for comfort you will not get either comfort or truth only soft soap and wishful thinking to begin, and in the end, despair.","The perfect church service would be the one we were almost unaware of; our attention would have been on God. But every novelty prevents this. It fixes our attention on the service itself; and thinking about worship is a different thing than worshipping ... \'Tis mad idolatry that makes the service greater than the god.","All the things that have ever deeply possessed your soul have been but hints of it, tantalizing glimpses, promises never quite fulfilled, echoes that died away just as they caught your ear. But if it should really become manifest - if there ever came an echo that did not die away but swelled into the sound itself - you would know it. Beyond all possibility of doubt you would say \'Here at last is the thing I was made for.\'","When we are lost in the woods, the sight of a signpost is a great matter.","As long as he doesn\'t convert it into action, it does not matter how much a man thinks about his repentance.","If human life is in fact ordered by a beneficent being whose knowledge of our real needs and of the way in which they can be satisfied infinitely exceeds our own, we must expect a priori that his operations will often appear to us far from beneficent and far from wise, and that it will be our highest prudence to give him our confidence in spite of this.","One of the dangers of having a lot of money is that you may be quite satisfied with the kinds of happiness money can give and so fail to realize your need for God. If everything seems to come simply by signing checks, you may forget that you are at every moment totally dependent on God.","When Christ died, He died for you individually just as much as if you had been the only person in the world.","Courage is not simply one of the virtues, but the form of every virtue at the testing point.","We shall not be well so long as we love and admire anything more than we love and admire God.","If our deepest desires cannot be satisfied in this world,    then we must have been made for another world.","When I lay these questions before God I get no answer. But a rather special sort of \'No answer.\' It is not the locked door. It is more like a silent, certainly not uncompassionate, gaze. As though He shook His head not in refusal but waiving the question. Like, \'Peace, child; you don\'t understand.","Now God, who has made us, knows what we are and that our happiness lies in Him.","No one ever told me that grief felt so like fear. I am not afraid, but the sensation is like being afraid. The same fluttering in the stomach, the same restlessness, the yawning. I keep on swallowing.","If you have once accepted Christianity, then some of its main doctrines shall be deliberately held before your mind for some time every day. That is why daily prayers and religious reading and churchgoing are necessary parts of the Christian life. We have to be continually reminded of what we believe. Neither this belief nor any other will automatically remain alive in the mind. It must be fed.","Pride gets no pleasure out of having something, only out of having more of it than the next man... It is the comparison that makes you proud: the pleasure of being above the rest. Once the element of competition is gone, pride is gone.","I pray because I can\'t help myself.","Every uncorrected error and unrepented sin is, in its own right, a fountain of fresh error and fresh sin flowing on to the end of time.","Those who put themselves in His hands will become perfect, as He is perfect- perfect in love, wisdom, joy, beauty, health, and immortality.  The change will not be completed in this life, for death is an important part of the treatment.  How far the change will have gone before death in any particular Christian is uncertain.","You must ask for God\'s help. Even when you have done so, it may seem to you for a long time that no help, or less help than you need, is being given. Never mind. After each failure, ask forgiveness, pick yourself up, and try again. Very often what God first helps us towards is not the virtue itself but just this power of always trying again.","Readers are advised to remember that the devil is a liar.","A creature revolting against a creator is revolting against the source of his own powers-including even his power to revolt...It is like the scent of a flower trying to destroy the flower.","There are only two kinds of people in the end: those who say to God, \\"Thy will be done,\\" and those to whom God says, in the end, \\"Thy will be done.\\" All that are in Hell, choose it. Without that self-choice there could be no Hell. No soul that seriously and constantly desires joy will ever miss it. Those who seek find. Those who knock it is opened.","For me, reason is the natural organ of truth; but imagination is the organ of meaning. Imagination, producing new metaphors or revivifying old, is not the cause of truth, but its condition.","The New Testament writers speak as if Christ\'s achievement in rising from the dead was the first event of its kind in the whole history of the universe. He is the \'first fruits,\' the pioneer of life,\' He has forced open a door that has been locked since the death of the first man. He has met, fought, and beaten the King of Death. Everything is different because He has done so.","Prosperity knits a man to the world.  He feels that he is finding his place in it while really it is finding its place in him.  His increasing reputation, his widening circle of acquaintances, his sense of importance, the growing pressure of absorbing and agreeable work build up in him a sense of being really at home on earth which is just what we want.","The safest road to hell is the gradual one - the gentle slope, soft underfoot, without sudden turnings, without milestones, without signposts.","Yes, pride is a perpetual nagging temptation.  Keep on knocking it on the head, but don\'t be too worried about it.  As long as one knows one is proud, one is safe from the worst form of pride.","One of the marks of a certain type of bad man is that he cannot give up a thing himself without wanting every one else to give it up. That is not the Christian way. An individual Christian may see fit to give up all sorts of things for special reasons--marriage, or meat, or beer, or the cinema; but the moment he starts saying the things are bad in themselves, or looking down his nose at other people who do use them, he has taken the wrong turning.","Praise is the mode of love which always has some element of joy in it.","For they (art and music) are not the thing itself; they are only the scent of a flower we have not found, the echo of a tune we have not heard, news from a country we have never yet visited.","We have failed to practise ourselves the kind of behaviour we expect from other people.","There is no use in talking as if forgiveness were easy. For we find that the work of forgiveness has to be done over and over again.","Your place in Heaven will seem to be made for you and you alone, because you were made for it.","The devil loves \'curing\' a small fault by giving you a great one.","Most people, if they had really learned to look into their own hearts, would know that they do want, and want acutely, something that cannot be had in this world. There are all sorts of things in this world that offer to give it to you, but they never quite keep their promise.","When we Christians behave badly, or fail to behave well, we are making Christianity unbelievable to the outside world. The wartime posters told us that Careless Talk costs Lives. It is equally true that Careless Lives cost Talk. Our careless lives set the outer world talking; and we give them grounds for talking in a way that throws doubt on the truth of Christianity itself.","That raises a terrible question. How is it that people who are quite obviously eaten up with Pride can say they believe in God and appear to themselves very religious? I am afraid it means they are worshiping an imaginary God.","All these toys were never intended to possess my heart. My true good is in another world, and my only real treasure is Christ.","[God] will not be used as a convenience. Men or nations who think they can revive the Faith in order to make a good society might just as well think they can use the stairs of heaven as a shortcut to the nearest chemist\'s shop.","The mold in which a key is made would be a strange thing, if you had never seen a key: and the key itself a strange thing if you had never seen a lock. Your soul has a curious shape because it is a hollow made to fit a particular swelling in the infinite contours of the divine substance, or a key to unlock one of the doors in the house with many mansions. Your place in heaven will seem to be made for you and you alone, because you were made for it -- made for it stitch by stitch as a glove is made for a hand.","until the theologians and the ordained clergy begin to communicate with ordinary people in the vernacular, in a way that they can understand, I\u2019m going to have to do this sort of thing.","If God \'foresaw\' our acts, it would be very hard to understand how we could be free not to do them. But suppose god is outside and above the Time-line... You never supposed that your actions at this moment were any less free because God knows what you are doing. Well, He know your tomorrow\'s actions in just the same way--because He is already in tomorrow and can simply watch you. In a sense, He does not know your action till you have done it: but the moment at which you have done it is already \'NOW\' for Him.","In our own case we accept excuses too easily; in other people\'s, we do not accept them easily enough.","If God had granted all the silly prayers I\'ve made in my life, where should I be now?","Really, a young Atheist cannot guard his faith too carefully. Dangers lie in wait for him on every side. You must not do, you must not even try to do, the will of the Father unless you are prepared to \\"know of the doctrine.\\" All my acts, desires, and thoughts were to be brought into harmony with universal Spirit. For the first time I examined myself with a seriously practical purpose. And there I found what appalled me; a zoo of lusts, a bedlam of ambitions, a nursery of fears, a harem of fondled hatreds. My name was legion.","God is no fonder of intellectual slackers than of any other slackers. If you are thinking of becoming a Christian, I warn you you are embarking on something which is going to take the whole of you, brains and all.","A world of nice people, content in their own niceness, looking no further, turned away from God, would be just as desperately in need of salvation as a miserable world-and might be even more difficult to save.","Mercy detached from justice grows unmerciful.","I do not believe one can settle how much we ought to give. I am afraid the only safe rule is to give more than we can spare. In other words, if our expenditure on comforts, luxuries, amusements, etc, is up to the standard common among those with the same income as our own, we are probably giving away too little. If our charities do not at all pinch or hamper us, I should say they are too small. There ought to be things we should like to do and cannot do because our charitable expenditure excludes them.","A little lie is like a little pregnancy it doesn\'t take long before everyone knows.","A man can\'t be always defending the truth; there must be a time to feed on it.","When we lose one blessing, another is often most unexpectedly given in its place [if we anticipate and look for it, rather than wallow in our \'supposed loss\'. It can be helpful to think of the loss of that blessing as simply necessary to make way for another different blessing].","I\'m on Aslan\'s side even if there isn\'t any Aslan to lead it. I\'m going to live as like a Narnian as I can even if there isn\'t any Narnia.","Friendship (as the ancients saw) can be a school of virtue, but also (as they did not see) a school of vice. It is ambivalent. It makes good men better and bad men worse.","Human beings look separate because you see them walking about separately. But then we are so made that we can see only the present moment. If we could see the past, then of course it would look different. For there was a time when every man was part of his mother, and (earlier still) part of his father as well, and when they were part of his grandparents. If you could see humanity spread out in time, as God sees it, it would look like one single growing thing--rather like a very complicated tree. Every individual would appear connected with every other.","Anyone who is honestly trying to be a Christian will soon find his intelligence being sharpened: one of the reasons why it needs no special education to be a Christian is that Christianity is an education itself. That is why an uneducated believer like Bunyan was able to write a book that has astonished the whole world.","Free will, though it makes evil possible, also makes possible any love or goodness or joy worth having.","Many people think their prayers are never answered because it is the answered ones they forget.","We may think God wants actions of a certain kind, but God wants people of a certain kind.","Think of me as a fellow patient in the same hospital who, having been admitted a little earlier could give some advice.","Only a real risk tests the reality of a belief.","We come to Scripture not to learn a subject but to steep ourselves in a person.","Delight is incomplete until it is expressed.","Looking for God-or Heaven-by exploring space is like reading or seeing all Shakespeare\'s plays in the hope that you will find Shakespeare as one of the characters.","You can\'t go against the grain of the universe and not expect to get splinters.","No soul that seriously and constantly desires joy will ever miss it. Those who seek find. To those who knock it is opened.","The Glory of God, and, as our only means of glorifying Him, the salvation of human souls, is the real business of life.","If God is Love, He is, by definition, something more than mere kindness. And it appears, from all the records, that though He has often rebuked us and condemned us, He has never regarded us with contempt. He has paid us the intolerable compliment of loving us, in the deepest, most tragic, most inexorable sense.","Our problem is not that we desire too much but too little.","Miracles do not, in fact, break the laws of nature.","One of the things that distinguishes man from the other animals is that he wants to know things, wants to find out what reality is like, simply for the sake of knowing. When that desire is completely quenched in anyone, I think he has become something less than human.","Gratitude exclaims, very properly, \'How good of God to give me this.\'","Is there a difference between a man who thinks that honesty is the best policy, and an honest man?","Vanity is really the least bad and most pardonable sort. The vain person wants praise, applause, admiration too much and is always angling for it. It is a fault, but a childlike and even (in an odd way) a humble fault. It shows that you are not yet completely contented with your own admiration. You value other people enough to want them to look at you. You are in fact still human.","The most dangerous thing you can do is to take any one impulse of your own nature and set it up as the thing you ought to follow at all costs. There is not one of them which will not make us into devils if we set it up as an absolute guide. You might think love of humanity in general was safe, but it is not. If you leave out justice you will find yourself breaking agreements and faking evidence in trials \\"for the sake of humanity\\", and become in the end a cruel and treacherous man.","I begin to suspect that the world is divided not only into the happy and the unhappy, but into those who like happiness and those who, odd as it seems, really don\'t.","The vice I am talking of is Pride or Self-Conceit: and the virtue opposite to it, in Christian morals, is called Humility...According to Christian teachers, the essential vice, the utmost evil, is Pride. Unchastity, anger, greed, drunkenness, and all that, are mere flea bites in comparison: it was through Pride that the devil became the devil: Pride leads to every other vice: it is the complete anti-God state of mind.","The worldly man treats certain people kindly because he \'likes\' them: the Christian, trying to treat every one kindly, finds him liking more and more people as he goes on - including people he could not even have imagined himself liking at the beginning.","Morality is a mountain which we cannot climb by our own efforts; and if we could we should only perish in the ice and unbreathable air of the summit, lacking those wings with which the rest of the journey has to be accomplished. For it is from there that the real ascent begins. The ropes and axes are \'done away\' and the rest is a matter of flying.","We have on the one hand a desperate need; hunger, sickness, and the dread of war. We have, on the other, the conception of something that might meet it: omnicompetent global technocracy. Are not these the ideal opportunity for enslavement? This is how it has entered before; a desperate need (real or apparent) in the one party, a power (real or apparent) to relieve it, in the other.","If they are wrong they need your prayers all the more; and if they are your enemies, then you are under orders to pray for them. That is one of the rules common to the whole house.","The doctrine of the Second Coming teaches us that we do not and cannot know when the world drama will end. The curtain may be rung down at any moment: say, before you have finished reading this paragraph.","The real trouble about the duty of forgiveness is that you do it with all your might on Monday and then find on Wednesday that it hasn\'t stayed put and all has to be done over again.","Each generation exercises power over its successors: and each, in so far as it modifies the environment bequeathed to it and rebels against tradition, resists and limits the power of its predecessors.","What can be better than to get out a book on Saturday afternoon and thrust all mundane considerations away till next week.","If minds are wholly dependent on brains and brains on biochemistry, and biochemistry (in the long run) on the meaningless flux of the atoms, I cannot understand how the thought of those minds should have any more significance than the sound of the wind in the trees.","The instrument through which you see God is your whole self. And if a man\'s self is not kept clean and bright, his glimpse of God will be blurred","It seems to me that we often, almost sulkily, reject the good that God offers us because, at that moment, we expected some other good.","In our adversity, God shouts to us.","You cannot go on \'explaining away\' for ever: you will find that you have explained explanation itself away. You cannot go on \'seeing through\' things for ever. The whole point of seeing through something is to see something through it.","We only learn to behave ourselves in the presence of God.","If anyone would like to acquire humility, I can, I think, tell him the first step. The first step is to realize that one is proud. And a biggish step, too. At least, nothing whatever can be done before it. If you think you are not conceited, it means that you are very conceited indeed.","We are born helpless. As soon as we are fully conscious we discover loneliness. We need others physically, emotionally, and intellectually. We need them if we are to know anything, even ourselves.","If one could run without getting tired I don\'t think one would often want to do anything else.","You and I have need of the strongest spell that can be found to wake us from the evil enchantment of worldliness.","A man who is eating or lying with his wife or preparing to go to sleep in humility, thankfulness and temperance, is, by Christian standards, in an infinitely higher state than one who is listening to Bach or reading Plato in a state of pride.","What seem our worst prayers may really be, in God\'s eyes, our best. Those, I mean, which are least supported by devotional feeling. For these may come from a deeper level than feeling. God sometimes seems to speak to us most intimately when he catches us, as it were, off our guard.","We can ignore even pleasure. But pain insists upon being attended to. God whispers to us in our pleasures, speaks in our conscience, but shouts in our pains: it is His megaphone to rouse a deaf world....No doubt pain as God\'s megaphone is a terrible instrument; it may lead to final and unrepented rebellion. But it gives the only opportunity the bad man can have for amendment. it removes the veil; it plants the flag of truth within the fortress of the rebel soul.","Only those who try to resist temptation know how strong it is. ... We never find out the strength of the evil impulse inside us until we try to fight it: and Christ, because He was the only man who never yielded to temptation, is also the only man who knows to the full what temptation means\u2014the only complete realist.","The books or the music in which we thought the beauty was located will betray us if we trust to them; it was not in them, it only came through them,and what came through them was longing. These things\u2014the beauty, the memory of our own past\u2014are good images of what we really desire; but if they are mistaken for the thing itself they turn into dumb idols,breaking the hearts of their worshippers. For they are not the thing itself; they are only the scent of a flower we have not found, the echo of a tune we have not heard, news from a country we have never yet visited.","If naturalism were true then all thoughts whatever would be wholly the result of irrational causes. It cuts its own throat.","Heaven, once attained, will work backwards and turn even agony into a glory","A young man who wishes to remain a sound atheist cannot be too careful of his reading.","We know nothing of religion here: we only think of Christ.","Do not let us mistake necessary evils for good.","The smallest good act today is the capture of a strategic point from which, a few months later, you may be able to go on to victories you never dreamed of.","The sun looks down on nothing half so good as a household laughing together over a meal.","I mean, the more a man was in the Devil\'s power, the less he would be aware of it, on the principle that a man is still fairly sober as long as he knows he\'s drunk.","I think each village was meant to feel pity for its own sick and poor whom it can help and I doubt if it is the duty of any private person to fix his mind on ills which he cannot help. This may even become an escape from the works of charity we really can do to those we know. God may call any one of us to respond to some far away problem or support those who have been so called. But we are finite and he will not call us everywhere or to support every worthy cause. And real needs are not far from us.","You can\'t get a cup of tea large enough or a book long enough to suit me.","Every time you make a choice you are turning the central part of you, the part of you that chooses, into something a little different from what it was before. And taking your life as a whole, with all your innumerable choices, all your life long you are slowly turning this central thing either into a heavenly creature or into a hellish creature...","I gave in, and admitted that God was God, and knelt and prayed: perhaps, that night, the most dejected and reluctant convert in all England.","Disobedience to conscience makes conscience blind.","Make your choice, adventurous Stranger, Strike the bell and bide the danger, Or wonder, till it drives you mad, What would have followed if you had.","There is a kind of happiness and wonder that makes you serious. It is too good to waste on jokes.","You understand sleep when you are awake, not while you are sleeping.  You can see mistakes in arithmetic when your mind is working properly; while you are making them you cannot see them.  Good people know about both bad and evil; bad people do not know about either.","Homemaking is surely in reality the most important work in the world.","At present we are on the outside of the world, the wrong side of the door. We discern the freshness and purity of morning, but they do not make us fresh and pure. We cannot mingle with the splendours we see. But all the leaves of the New Testament are rustling with the rumour that it will not always be so. Some day, God willing, we shall get in.","Can a mortal ask questions which God finds unanswerable? Quite easily, I should think. All nonsense questions are unanswerable. How many hours are in a mile? Is yellow square or round? Probably half the questions we ask - half our great theological and metaphysical problems - are like that.","Grief is like a long valley, a winding valley where any bend may reveal a totally new landscape.","Prayer in the sense of petition, asking for things, is a small part of it; confession and penitence are its threshold, adoration its sanctuary, the presence and vision and enjoyment of God its bread and wine.","Chronological snobbery is the uncritical acceptance of the intellectual climate common to our own age and the assumption that whatever has gone out of date is on that account discredited. You must find why it went out of date. Was it ever refuted (and if so by whom, where, and how conclusively), or did it merely die away as fashions do? If the latter, this tells us nothing about its truth or falsehood.","Who will take medicine unless he knows he is in the grip of disease?","And above all, you must be asking which door is the true one; not which pleases you best by its paint and panelling\u2026the question should never be: \u2018Do I like that kind of service?\u2019 but \u2018Are these doctrines true: Is holiness there? Does my conscience move me towards this? Is my reluctance to move to this door due to my pride, or my mere taste, or my personal dislike for this particular door-keeper?","Now God designed the human machine to run on Himself. He Himself is the fuel our spirits were designed to burn, or the food our spirits were designed to feed on. There is no other.","If there ever was a time that nothing existed, then nothing would exist now","No natural feelings are high or low, holy or unholy, in themselves. They are all holy when God\'s hand is on the rein. They all go bad when they set up on their own and make themselves into false gods.","The Son of God became a man to enable men to become sons of God.\\" ~ Mere Christianity, By C. S. Lewis","If no set of moral ideas were truer or better than any other, there would be no sense in preferring civilised morality to savage morality.","The heart never takes the place of the head: but it can, and should, obey it.","Remember He is the artist and you are only the picture. You can\'t see it. So quietly submit to be painted---i.e., keep fulfilling all the obvious duties of your station (you really know quite well enough what they are!), asking forgiveness for each failure and then leaving it alone.You are in the right way. Walk---don\'t keep on looking at it.","Nature never taught me that there exists a God of glory and of infinite majesty. I had to learn that in other ways. But nature gave the word glory a meaning for me. I still do not know where else I could have found one.","If devils exist, their first aim is to give you an anesthetic -- to put you off your guard. Only if that fails, do you become aware of them.","Until you have given up yourself to Him, you will not have a real self.","God whispers to us in our pleasures, speaks to us in our conscience, but shouts in our pains.","It is that of an unsatisfied desire which is itself more desirable than any other satisfaction.","Virtue - even attempted virtue - brings light; indulgence brings fog.","Really great moral teachers never do introduce new moralities: it is quacks and cranks who do that.... The real job of every moral teacher is to keep on bringing us back, time after time, to the old simple principles which we are all so anxious not to see; like bringing a horse back and back to the fence it has refused to jump or bringing a child back and back to the bit in its lesson that it wants to shirk.","Believing things on authority only means believing them because you have been told them by someone you think trustworthy. Ninety-nine per cent of the things you believe are believed on authority... Every historical event in the world is believed on authority. None of us has seen the Norman Conquest or the defeat of the Armada.","The sane would do no good if they made themselves mad to help madmen.","Wouldn\'t it be dreadful if some day in our own world, at home, men start going wild inside, like the animals here, and still look like men, so that you\'d never know which were which.","You can begin as if nothing had ever gone wrong. White as snow.","Lust is a poor, weak, whimpering, whispering thing compared with that richness and energy of desire which will arise when lust has been killed.","Love anything and your heart will be wrung and possibly broken. If you want to make sure of keeping it intact you must give it to no one, not even an animal.","The very nature of Joy makes nonsense of our common distinction between having and wanting.","I do not believe one can settle how much we ought to give. I am afraid the only safe rule is to give more than we can spare.","Selfishness has never been admired.","You cannot love a fellow creature fully till you love God.","Love, having become a god, becomes a demon.","Now that I am a Christian I do have moods in which the whole thing looks improbable: but when I was an atheist I had moods in which Christianity looked terribly probable.","I do not know why there is this difference, but I am sure that God keeps no one waiting unless He sees that it is good for him to wait. When you do enter your room, you will find that the long wait has done you some kind of good which you would not have had otherwise. But you must regard it as waiting, not as camping. You must keep on praying for light: and of course, even in the hall, you must begin trying to obey the rules which are common to the whole house. And above all you must be asking which door is the true one; not which pleases you best by its paint and paneling.","If I find in myself a desire which no experience in this world can satisfy, the most probable explanation is that I was made for another world.","The real trouble is that \'kindness\' is a quality fatally easy to attribute to ourselves on quite inadequate grounds. Everyone feels benevolent if nothing happens to be annoying him at the moment. Thus a man easily comes to console himself for all his other vices by a conviction that \'his heart\'s in the right place\' and \'he wouldn\'t hurt a fly,\' though in fact he has never made the slightest sacrifice for a fellow creature. We think we are kind when we are only happy: it is not so easy, on the same grounds, to imagine oneself temperate, chaste, or humble.","What do people mean when they say, \'I am not afraid of God because I know He is good\'? Have they never even been to a dentist?","Before we can be cured we must want to be cured. Those who really wish for help will get it; but for many modern people even the wish is difficult.","Consciousness is either inexplicable illusion, or else revelation.","Give up yourself, and you will find your real self. Lose your life and you will save it.","In God there is no hunger that needs to be filled, only plenteousness that desires to give.","Unless I believe in God, I cannot believe in thought: so I can never use thought to disbelieve in God.","I came alive when I started loving you.","The task of the modern educator is not to cut down jungles, but to irrigate deserts.","Safe?\u201d said Mr. Beaver; \u201cdon\u2019t you hear what Mrs. Beaver tells you? Who said anything about safe? \u2018Course he isn\u2019t safe. But he\u2019s good. He\u2019s the King, I tell you.","Pride gets no pleasure out of having something, only out of having more of it than the next man.","We live, in fact, in a world starved for solitude, silence, and private: and therefore starved for meditation and true friendship.","God has not been trying an experiment on my faith or love in order to find out their quality. He knew it already. It was I who didn\'t. In this trial He makes us occupy the dock, the witness box, and the bench all at once. He always knew that my temple was a house of cards. His only way of making me realize the fact was to knock it down.","God is not merely good, but goodness; goodness is not merely divine, but God.","Bereavement is a universal and integral part of our experience of love.","There is something which unites magic and applied science (technology) while separating them from the \\"wisdom\\" of earlier ages. For the wise men of old, the cardinal problem of human life was how to conform the soul to objective reality, and the solution was wisdom, self-discipline , and virtue. For the modern, the cardinal problem is how to conform reality to the wishes of man, and the solution is a technique.","Grief. The pain now is part of the happiness then. That\'s the deal.","Do not imagine that if you meet a really humble man he will be what most people call \\"humble\\" nowadays: he will not be a sort of greasy, smarmy person, who is always telling you that, of course, he is a nobody. Probably all you will think about him is that he seemed a cheerful, intelligent chap who took a real interest in what you said to him.","Who can endure a doctrine which would allow only dentists to say whether our teeth were aching, only cobblers to say whether our shoes hurt us, and only governments to tell us whether we were being well governed?","What would really satisfy us would be a God who said of anything we happened to like doing, \'What does it matter so long as they are contented?\'","It is Christ Himself, not the Bible, who is the true Word of God. The Bible, read in the right spirit and with the guidance of good teachers, will bring us to Him.","We have a strange illusion that mere time cancels sin. But mere time does nothing either to the fact or to the guilt of a sin.","Experience: that most brutal of teachers. But you learn, my God do you learn.","To be ignorant and simple now-not to be able to meet the enemies on their own ground-would be to throw down our weapons and to betray our uneducated brethren who have, under God, no defense but us against the intellectual attacks of the heathen. Good philosophy must exist, if for no other reason, because bad philosophy needs to be answered.","Nobody who gets enough food and clothing in a world where most are hungry and cold has any business to talk about \'misery.\'","It is not enough to want to get rid of one\u2019s sins, we also need to believe in the One who saves us from our sins.","I was the lion who forced you to join with Aravis. I was the cat who comforted you among the houses of the dead. I was the lion who drove the jackals from you while you slept. I was the lion who gave the horses the new strength of fear for the last mill so that you should reach King Lune in time. And I was the lion you do not remember who pushed the boat in which you lay, a child near death, so that it came to shore where a man sat, wakeful at midnight, to receive you.","I seemed to hear God saying, \\"Put down your gun and we\'ll talk.","The incalculable winds of fantasy and music and poetry, the mere face of a girl, the song of a bird, or the sight of a horizon, are always blowing evil\u2019s whole structure away.","Meanwhile, little people like you and me, if our prayers are sometimes granted, beyond all hope and probability, had better not draw hasty conclusions to our own advantage. If we were stronger, we might be less tenderly treated. If we were braver, we might be sent, with far less help, to defend far more desperate posts in the great battle.","There is no other day. All days are present now. This moment contains all moments.","To be in love involves the most irresistible conviction that one will go on being in love until one dies, and that possession of the beloved will confer, not merely frequent ecstasies, but settled, fruitful, deep-rooted, lifelong happiness.","I never fully understood it till my friend Professor Tolkien asked me the very simple question, \'What class of men would you expect to be most preoccupied with, and hostile to, the idea of escape?\' and gave the obvious answer: jailers.","They have chosen cunning instead of belief. Their prison is only in their minds, yet they are in that prison; and so afraid of being taken in that they cannot be taken out.","The man in Christ rose again, not only the God.","Christianity does not want us to reduce by one atom the hatred we feel for cruelty and treachery. We ought to hate them. Not one word of what we have said about them needs to be unsaid. But it does want us to hate them in the same way in which we hate things in ourselves: being sorry that the man should have done such things, and hoping, if it is anyway possible, that somehow, sometime, somewhere he can be cured and made human again.","When you go to church you are really listening-in to the secret wireless from out friends: that is why the enemy is so anxious to prevent us from going. He does it by playing on our conceit and laziness and intellectual snobbery.","The enemy will not see you vanish into God\'s company without an effort to reclaim you.","It\'s not a question of God \'sending\' us to Hell. In each of us there is something growing up which will of itself be Hell unless it is nipped in the bud.","Do not be deceived, Wormwood. Our cause is never more in danger than when a human, no longer desiring, but still intending, to do our Enemy\'s will, looks round upon a universe from which every trace of Him seems to have vanished, and asks why he has been forsaken, and still obeys.","We want, in fact, not so much a father in heaven as a grandfather in heaven: a senile benevolence who, as they say, \\"liked to see young people enjoying themselves\\" and whose plan for the universe was simply that it might be truly said at the end of each day, \\"a good time was had by all.\\"","The Scotch catechism says that man\'s chief end is \'to glorify God and enjoy Him forever.\' But we shall then know that these are the same thing. Fully to enjoy is to glorify. In commanding us to glorify Him, God is inviting us to enjoy Him.","No doubt those who really founded modern science were usually those whose love of truth exceeded their love of power.","It is a happy moment when our desire crosses with the will of Heavenly Father.","The more often he feels without acting, the less he will be able ever to act, and, in the long run, the less he will be able to feel.","When you are behaving as if you loved someone, you will presently come to love them.","Men became scientific because they expected Law in Nature, and they expected Law in Nature because they believed in a Law Giver.","Can a mortal ask questions which God finds unanswerable? Quite easily, I should think. All nonsense questions are unanswerable.","Pride, on the other hand, is the mother of all sins, and the original sin of lucifer.... An instrument strung, but preferring to play itself because it thinks it knows the tune better than the Musician","When the opposite of your prayer occurs, your prayer hasn\'t been ignored; it\'s been considered & refused for your ultimate good.","If crime and disease are to be regarded as the same thing, it follows that any state of mind which our masters choose to call \'disease\' can be treated as a crime and compulsorily cured.","In the long run the answer to all those who object to the doctrine of hell, is itself a question: What are you asking God to do? To wipe out their past sins and, at all costs, to give them a fresh start, smoothing every difficulty and offering every miraculous help? But He has done so, on Calvary. To forgive them? They will not be forgiven. To leave them alone? Alas, I am afraid that is what He does.","I believe that there are too many accommodating preachers... Jesus Christ did not say \\"Go into the world and tell the world that it is quite right.\\" The Gospel is something completely different. In fact, it is directly opposed to the world.","The road to the promised land runs past Sinai. The moral law may exist to be transcended: but there is no transcending it for those who have not first admitted its claims up on them, and then tried with all their strength to meet that claim, and fairly and squarely faced the fact of their failure.","For in grief nothing \\"stays put.\\" One keeps on emerging from a phase, but it always recurs. Round and round. Everything repeats. Am I going in circles, or dare I hope I am on a spiral? But if a spiral, am I going up or down it? How often -- will it be for always? -- how often will the vast emptiness astonish me like a complete novelty and make me say, \\"I never realized my loss till this moment\\"? The same leg is cut off time after time.","Honest rejection of Christ, however mistaken, will be forgiven and healed ... but to evade the Son of Man, to look the other way, to pretend you haven\'t noticed, to become suddenly absorbed in something on the other side of the street, to leave the receiver off the telephone because it might be He who was ringing up, to leave unopened certain letters in a strange handwriting because they might be from Him -- this is a different matter. You may not be certain yet whether you ought to be a Christian; but you do know you ought to be a Man, not an ostrich, hiding its head in the sand.","We make men without chests and expect from them virtue and enterprise. We laugh at honor and are shocked to find traitors in our midst.","Is any pleasure on Earth as great as a circle of Christian friends?","He told people that their sins were forgiven, and never waited to consult all the other people whom their sins had undoubtedly injured. He unhesitatingly behaved as if He was the party chiefly concerned, the person chiefly offended in all offenses. This makes sense only if He really was God whose laws are broken and whose love is wounded in every sin.","While we are actually subjected to them, the \'moods\' and \'spirits\' of nature point no morals. Overwhelming gaiety, insupportable grandeur, sombre desolation are flung at you. Make what you can of them, if you must make at all. The only imperative that nature utters is, \'Look. Listen. Attend.","That fierce imprisonment in the self is but the obverse of the self-giving which is absolute reality.","You cannot make men good by law.","If you don\'t listen to theology, that won\'t mean you have no ideas about God, it will mean you have a lot of wrong ones.","Believe in God like you believe in the sunrise. Not because you can see it, but because you can see all it touches.","How could an idiotic universe have produced creatures whose mere dreams are so much stronger, better, subtler than itself?","Love is the great conqueror of lust.","It may be better to live under robber barons than under omnipotent moral busybodies.","It would be impossible to accept naturalism itself if we really and consistently believed naturalism. For naturalism is a system of thought. But for naturalism all thoughts are mere events with irrational causes. It is, to me at any rate, impossible to regard the thoughts which make up naturalism in that way and, at the same time, regard them as a real insight into external reality...If it is true, then we can know no truths. It cuts its own throat.","Prayer is request. The essence of request, as distinct from compulsion, is that it may or may not be granted. And if an infinitely wise Being listens to the requests of finite and foolish creatures, of course He will sometimes grant and sometimes refuse them.","Freedom always comes with a price.","A dragon has just flown over the tree-tops and lighted on the beach. Yes, I am afraid it is between us and the ship. And arrows are no use against dragons. And they\'re not at all afraid of fire.\\" \\"With your Majesty\'s leave-\\" began Reepicheep. \\"No, Reepicheep,\\" said the King very firmly, \\"you are not to attempt a single combat with it.","Awake. Love. Think. Speak. Be walking trees. Be talking beasts. Be divine waters.","You can give the Devil too much or too little attention.","Much of the modern resistance to chastity comes from men\'s belief that they \'own\' their bodies\u2014those vast and perilous estates, pulsating with the energy that made the worlds, in which they find themselves without their consent and from which they are ejected at the pleasure of Another!","But I will not tell you how long or short the way will be; only that it lies across a river. But do not fear that, for I am the great Bridge Builder.","Don\'t think of God in terms of forms, because forms are limited and God is unlimited.","Extraordinary things only happen to extraordinary people. Maybe it\'s a sign that you\'ve got an extraordinary destiny--something greater than you could\'ve imagined.","When the time comes to you at which you will be forced at last to utter the speech which has lain at the center of your soul for years, which you have, all that time, idiot-like, been saying over and over, you\'ll not talk about the joy of words. I saw well why the gods do not speak to us openly, nor let us answer. Till that word can be dug out of us, why should they hear the babble that we think we mean? How can they meet us face to face till we have faces?","That is why Christians are told not to judge. We see only the results which a man\'s choices make out of his raw material. But God does not judge him on the raw material at all, but on what he has done with it.","Without the aid of trained emotions the intellect is powerless against the animal organism.","It matters enormously if I alienate anyone from the truth.","Mere improvement is not redemption, though redemption always improves people","I can imagine no man who will look with more horror on the End than a conscientious revolutionary who has, in a sense sincerely, been justifying cruelties and injustices inflicted on millions of his contemporaries by the benefits which he hopes to confer on future generations: generations who, as one terrible moment now reveals to him, were never going to exist. Then he will see the massacres, the faked trials, the deportations, to be all ineffaceably real, an essential part, his part, in the drama that has just ended: while the future Utopia had never been anything but a fantasy.","I dread specialists in power because they are specialists speaking outside of their special subject.","Chastity is the most unpopular of the Christian virtues.","There are no ordinary people. You have never talked to a mere mortal.","We \'have all we want\' is a terrible saying when \'all\' does not include God. We find God an interruption. As St. Augustine says somewhere, \'God wants to give us something, but cannot, because our hands are full - there\'s nowhere for Him to put it.\'","The choice of every lost soul can be expressed in the words \\"Better to reign in hell than serve in heaven.\\" There is always something they insist on keeping, even at the price of misery.","We are half-hearted creatures, fooling about with drink and sex and ambition when infinite joy is offered us.","God is the only comfort, He is also the supreme terror: the thing we most need and the thing we most want to hide from.","Every story of conversion is the story of a blessed defeat.","The truth is, of course, that what one regards as interruptions are precisely one\'s life.","Friendship is...the sort of love one can imagine between angels.","In the truest sense, Christian pilgrims have the best of both worlds. We have joy whenever this world reminds us of the next, and we take solace whenever it does not.","Certain things, if not seen as lovely or detestable, are not being correctly seen at all.","Q. What is your view of the daily discipline of the Christian life - the need for taking time to be alone with God? Lewis: \\"We have our New Testament regimental orders upon the subject. I would take it for granted that everyone who becomes a Christian would undertake this practice. It is enjoined upon us by Our Lord; and since they are his commands, I believe in following them. It is always just possible that Jesus Christ meant what he said when He told us to seek the secret place and to close the door.","If there is equality it is in His love, not in us.","Next to the Blessed Sacrament itself, your neighbor is the holiest object presented to your senses.","My idea of God is not a divine idea. It has to be shattered time after time. He shatters it Himself.","Be sure that the ins and outs of your individuality are no mystery to Him; and one day they will no longer be a mystery to you.","There are no ordinary people. You have never talked to a mere mortal. Nations, cultures, arts, civilizations--these are mortal, and their life is to ours as the life of a gnat.","If nothing is self-evident, nothing can be proved. Similarly if nothing is obligatory for its own sake, nothing is obligatory at all.","God is love, and that love works through men-especially through the whole community of Christians.","The continual looking forward to the eternal world is not a form of escapism or wishful thinking, but one of the things a Christian is meant to do.","There have been times when I think we do not desire heaven but more often I find myself wondering whether, in our heart of hearts, we have ever desired anything else.","Jesus Christ did not say, \'Go into the world and tell the world that it is quite right.\'","This moment contains all moments.","No one returns from Christianity to the same state he was before Christianity but into a worse state: the difference between a pagan and an apostate is the difference between an unmarried woman and an adulteress. For faith perfects nature but faith lost corrupts nature. Therefore many men of our time have lost not only the supernatural light but also the natural light which pagans possessed.","Our desire is not only to SEE glory, but to participate in the glory we see.","God is the food our spirits were designed to feed on.","The most valuable thing the Psalms do for me is to express the same delight in God which made David dance.","Man is not the centre. God does not exist for the sake of man. Man does not exist for his own sake.","Almost certainly God is not in time. His life does not consist of moments one following another...Ten-thirty-- and every other moment from the beginning of the world--is always Present for Him. If you like to put it this way, He has all eternity in which to listen to the split second of prayer put up by a pilot as his plane crashes in flames.","The very man who has argued you down, will sometimes be found, years later, to have been influenced by what you said","Obedience is the road to freedom, humility the road to pleasure, unity the road to personality.","Badness cannot succeed even in being bad in the same way in which goodness is good. Goodness is, so to speak, itself: badness is only spoiled goodness. Evil is a parasite, not an original thing.","I think we must attack -- wherever we meet it -- the nonsensical idea that mutually exclusive propositions about God can both be true.","Evil can be undone, but it cannot \'develop\' into good. Time does not heal it. The spell must be unwound, bit by bit, \'with backward mutters of dissevering power\' - or else not.","All possible knowledge, then, depends on the validity of reasoning...Unless human reasoning is valid no science can be true.","I am a product of long corridors, empty sunlit rooms, upstairs indoor silences, attics explored in solitude, distant noises of gurgling cisterns and pipes, and the noise of wind under the tiles. Also, of endless books.","There are no ordinary people. You have never talked to a mere mortal.... Next to the Blessed Sacrament itself, your neighbor is the holiest object presented to your senses. If he is your Christian neighbor he is holy in almost the same way, for in him also Christ verse latitat - the glorifier and the glorified, Glory Himself, is truly hidden.","In the moral sphere, every act of justice or charity involves putting ourselves in the other person\'s place and thus transcending our own competitive particularity.","The proper aim of giving is to put the recipient in a state where he no longer needs our gift.","But in reading great literature I become a thousand men and yet remain myself. Like the night sky in the Greek poem, I see with a myriad eyes, but it is still I who see. Here, as in worship, in love, in moral action, and in knowing, I transcend myself; and am never more myself than when I do.","I am struck here by the curious mixture of justice and injustice in our lives. We are blamed for our real faults but usually not on the right occasions.","Omnipotence means power to do all that is intrinsically possible, not to do the intrinsically impossible. You may attribute miracles to Him, but not nonsense.","In worship, God imparts himself to us.","You can get a large audience together for a strip-tease act\u2014that is, to watch a girl undress on the stage. Now suppose you come to a country where you could fill a theatre by simply bringing a covered plate on to the stage and then slowly lifting the cover so as to let every one see, just before the lights went out, that it contained a mutton chop or a bit of bacon, would you not think that in that country something had gone wrong with the appetite for food?","It was not for societies or states, that Christ died, but for men.","The death of a beloved is an amputation.","Forgive us as we forgive- we are offered forgiveness on no other terms. To refuse it is to refuse Gods mercy for ourselves.","Love, in its own nature, demands the perfecting of the beloved.","In each of my friends there is something that only some other friend can fully bring out. By myself I am not large enough to call the whole man into activity; I want other lights than my own to show all his facets... Hence true Friendship is the least jealous of loves. Two friends delight to be joined by a third, and three by a fourth, if only the newcomer is qualified to become a real friend. They can then say, as the blessed souls say in Dante, \\"Here comes one who will augment our loves.\\" For in this love \\"to divide is not to take away.","It is safe to tell the pure in heart that they shall see God, for only the pure in heart want to.","We want to know not how we should pray if we were perfect but how we should pray being as we now are ... It is no use to ask God with factitious earnestness for A when our whole mind is in reality filled with the desire for B. We must lay before Him what is in us, not what ought to be in us.","Mortal lovers must not try to remain at the first step; for lasting passion is the dream of a harlot and from it we wake in despair.","Afflictions are... if we can so take them, our share in the Passion of Christ","Die before you die, there is no chance after.","The first thing to get clear about Christian morality between man and man is that in this department Christ did not come to teach any brand new morality. The Golden Rule of the New Testament (Do as you would be done by) is a summing up of what everyone, at bottom, had always known to be right.","[The decay of Logic results from an] untroubled assumption that the particular is real and the universal is not.","When He [God] talks of their losing their selves, He means only abandoning the clamour of self-will; once they have done that, He really gives them back all their personality, and boasts (I am afraid, sincerely) that when they are wholly His they will be more themselves than ever.","God is not an optional extra, He\'s an absolute must!","It will not bother me in the hour of death to reflect that I have been \\"had for a sucker\\" by any number of imposters but it would be a torment to know that one had refused even one person in need.","It doesn\'t really matter whether you grip the arms of the dentist\'s chair or let your hands lie in your lap. The drill drills on.","Do not waste time bothering whether you \\"love\\" your neighbor; act as if you did.","I have been feeling very much lately that cheerful insecurity is what our Lord asks of us.","When all the suns and nebulae have passed away, each one of you will still be alive.","A children\'s story that can only be enjoyed by children is not a good children\'s story in the slightest.\\" He also said: \\"No book is really worth reading at the age of ten which is not equally - and often far more - worth reading at the age of 50 and beyond.","Theology is like a map. Merely learning and thinking about the Christian doctrines, if you stop there, is less real and less exciting than the sort of thing my friend got in the desert. Doctrines are not God: they are only a kind of map. But that map is based on the experience of hundreds of people who really were in touch with God--experiences compared with which many thrills of pious feelings you and I are likely to get on our own are very elementary and very confused. And secondly, if you want to get any further you must use the map.","Man does not have a soul. He is a soul. He has a body.","It is hardly complimentary to God that we should choose him as an alternative to hell.","To live his life in his own way, to call his house his castle, to enjoy the fruits of his own labour, to educate his children as his conscience directs, to save for their prosperity after his death -- these are wishes deeply ingrained in civilised man. Their realization is almost as necessary to our virtues as to our happiness. From their total frustration disastrous results both moral and psychological might follow.","But suppose you struggle through to the good and find that it also is dreadful? How if food itself turns out to be the very thing you can\'t eat, and home the very place you can\'t live, and your very comforter the person who makes you uncomfortable? Then, indeed, there is no rescue possible: the last card has been played.","Christian love, either towards God or towards man, is an affair of the will.","Of all bad men religious bad men are the worst.","Above all, do not attempt to use science (I mean, the real sciences) as a defence against Christianity. They will positively encourage him to think about realities he can\u2019t touch and see.","The problem of reconciling human suffering with the existence of a God who loves, is only insoluble so long as we attach a trivial meaning to the word \\"love.\\"","The prayer preceding all prayers is \'May it be the real I who speaks. May it be the real Thou that I speak to.\'","And since we cannot deceive the whole human race all the time, it is most important thus to cut every generation off from all others; for where learning makes a free commerce between the ages there is always the danger that the characteristic errors of one may be corrected by the characteristic truths of another.","On the whole, God\u2019s love for us is a much safer subject to think about than our love for Him.","Of Course God does not consider you hopeless. If He did, He would not be moving you to seek Him (and He obviously is)... Continue seeking Him with seriousness. Unless He wanted you, you would not be wanting Him.","Those who torment us for our own good will torment us without end, for they do so with the approval of their own conscience.","Remember that all worlds draw to an end and that noble death is a treasure which no one is too poor to buy.","We do not want to merely \u201csee\u201d beauty. We want to be united with it, to receive it into ourselves, to become part of it.","We must beware of the Past, mustn\'t we? I mean that any fixing of the mind on old evils beyond what is absolutely necessary for repenting our own sins and forgiving those of others is certainly useless and usually bad for us. Notice in Dante that the lost souls are entirely concerned with their past! Not so the saved.","Affection is responsible for nine-tenths of whatever solid and durable happiness there is in our lives.","And how could we endure to live and let time pass if we were always crying for one day or one year to come back--if we did not know that every day in a life fills the whole life with expectation and memory and that these are that day?","Either Jesus is the Son of God ; or a madman or worse. But His \\n being just a great teacher? He\'s not left that open to us.","There are no ordinary people.. it is immortals whom we joke with, work with, marry, snub, and exploit.","It is after you have realized that there is a real Moral Law, and a Power behind the law, and that you have broken that law and put yourself wrong with that Power -- it is after all this, and not a moment sooner, that Christianity begins to talk.","By the very act of arguing, you awake the patient\'s reason; and once it is awake, who can foresee the result?","If ever they remembered their life in this world it was as one remembers a dream.","Our temptation is to look eagerly for the minimum that will be accepted. We are in fact very like honest but reluctant taxpayers.","Length of days with an evil heart is only length of misery.","Clearly one must read every good book at least once every ten years.","The knight is a man of blood and iron, a man familiar with the sight of smashed faces and the ragged stumps of lopped-off limbs; he is also a demure, almost a maidenlike, guest in hall, a gentle, modest, unobtrusive man. He is not a compromise or happy mean between ferocity and meekness; he is fierce to the nth and meek to the nth.","After an error you need not only to remove the causes but also to correct the error itself: after a sin you must not only, if possible, remove the temptation, you must also go back and repent the sin itself. In each case an \'undoing\' is required.","You cannot go on indefinitely being just an ordinary, decent egg. We must be hatched or go bad.","Man is to be understood only in his relationship to God.","But Pride always means enmity -- it is enmity. And not only enmity between man and man, but enmity to God.","These, then, are the two points I wanted to make. First, that human beings, all over the earth, have this curious idea that they ought to behave in a certain way, and cannot really get rid of it. Secondly, that they do not in fact behave in that way. They know the Law of Nature; they break it. These two facts are the foundation of all clear thinking about ourselves and the universe we live in.","A pipe gives a wise man time to think and a fool something to stick in his mouth.","Humans are amphibians - half spirit and half animal. As spirits they belong to the eternal world, but as animals they inhabit time.","One road leads home and a thousand roads lead into the wilderness.","Look for Christ and you will find Him, and with Him everything else thrown in","We must lay before him what is in us; not what ought to be in us.","Every disability conceals a vocation, if only we can find it, which will \'turn the necessity to glorious gain.","We do not want merely to see beauty... we want something else which can hardly be put into words- to be united with the beauty we see, to pass into it, to receive it into ourselves, to bathe in it, to become part of it. That is why we have peopled air and earth and water with gods and goddesses, and nymphs and elves.","Friendship is unnecessary, like philosophy, like art... It has no survival value; rather it is one of those things that give value to survival.","Her absence is like the sky, spread over everything.","There have been men before now who got so interested in proving the existence of God that they came to care nothing for God Himself.","Suspicion often creates what it suspects.","Once in our world, a Stable had something in it that was bigger than our whole world.","If you ask why we should obey God, in the last resort the answer is, \'I am.\' To know God is to know that our obedience is due to Him.","Very often the only way to get a quality in reality is to start behaving as if you had it already.","An \'impersonal God\'-well and good. A subjective God of beauty, truth and goodness, inside our own heads-better still. A formless life-force surging through us, a vast power which we can tap-best of all. But God himself, alive, pulling at the other end of the cord, perhaps approaching at an infinite speed, the hunter, King, husband-that is quite another matter.","Gratitude looks to the Past and love to the Present; fear, avarice, lust, and ambition look ahead.","Once you become aware that the main business that you are here for is to know God, most of life\'s problems fall into place of their own accord. J.I. Packer\\nAim at heaven and you will get earth thrown in. Aim at earth and you will get neither.","Thirst was made for water. Inquiry for truth.","We ought to give thanks for all fortune: if it is good, because it is good; if bad, because it works in us patience, humility, contempt of this world and the hope of our eternal country.","Many things, such as loving, going to sleep, or behaving unaffectedly - are done worst when we try hardest to do them.","The Church exists for nothing else but to draw men into Christ.","When I was ten, I read fairy tales in secret and would have been ashamed if I had been found doing so. Now that I am fifty, I read them openly. When I became a man I put away childish things, including the fear of childishness and the desire to be very grown up.","God descends to re-ascend. He comes down; down from the heights of absolute being into time and space, down into humanity ... down to the very roots and sea-bed of the nature He has created. But He goes down to come up again and bring the ruined world up with Him.","I care far more how humanity lives than how long. Progress, for me, means increasing goodness and happiness of individual lives. For the species, as for each man, mere longevity seems to me a contemptible ideal.","No one ever told me that grief felt so like fear. I am not afraid, but the sensation is like being afraid. The same fluttering in the stomach, the same restlessness, the yawning. I keep on swallowing. At other times it feels like being mildly drunk, or concussed. There is a sort of invisible blanket between the world and me. I find it hard to take in what anyone says. Or perhaps, hard to want to take it in. It is so uninteresting. Yet I want the others to be about me. I dread the moments when the house is empty. If only they would talk to one another and not to me.","Satan always sends error into the world in pairs that are opposites. His great hope is that you will get so upset about one of his errors, that you\'ll react into the opposite one, and he\'s got you.","It was when I was happiest that I longed most...The sweetest thing in all my life has been the longing...to find the place where all the beauty came from.","Five senses; an incurably abstract intellect; a haphazardly selective memory; a set of preconceptions and assumptions so numerous that I can never examine more than a minority of them - never become even conscious of them all.","And He [God] and you are two things of such a kind that if you really get into any kind of touch with Him you will, in fact, be humble--delightedly humble, feeling the infinite relief of having for once got rid of all the silly nonsense about your own dignity which has made you restless and unhappy all your life.","I have come home at last! This is my real country! I belong here. This is the land I have been looking for all my life, though I never knew it till now... Come further up, come further in!","The sense that in this universe we are treated as strangers, the longing to be acknowledged, to meet with some response, to bridge some chasm that yawns between us and reality, is part of our inconsolable secret. And surely, from this point of view, the promise of glory, in the sense described, becomes highly relevant to our deep desire. For glory meant good report with God, acceptance by God, response, acknowledgment, and welcome into the heart of things. The door on which we have been knocking all our lives will open at last.","This is my password,\\" said the King as he drew his sword. \\"The light is dawning, the lie broken. Now guard thee, miscreant, for I am Tirian of Narnia.","The world is so much larger than I thought. I thought we went along paths--but it seems there are no paths. The going itself is the path.","If religion does not make us better people, it will make us very much worse. And of all the bad men who have lived, the religious \\"bad man\\" is the worst of all.","We read to know we are not alone.","But courage, child: we are all between the paws of the true Aslan.","As long as you notice, and have to count the steps, you are not yet dancing but only learning to dance. A good shoe is a shoe you don\'t notice. Good reading becomes possible when you need not conciously think about eyes, or light, or print, or spelling. The perfect church service would be the one we were almost unaware of; our attention would have been on God.","We treat our dogs as if they were \\"almost human\\": that is why they really become \\"almost human\\" in the end.","We are all fallen creatures and all very hard to live with.","Reality, looked at steadily, is unbearable.","Death and resurrection are what the story is about and had we but eyes to see it, this has been hinted on every page, met us, in some disguise, at every turn, and even been muttered in conversations between such minor characters (if they are minor characters) as the vegetables.","The first action to be taken is to pull ourselves together. If we are going to be destroyed by an atomic bomb, let that bomb, when it comes, find us doing sensible and human things -- praying, working, teaching, reading, listening to music, bathing the children, playing tennis, chatting to our friends over a pint and a game of darts -- not huddled together like frightened sheep and thinking about bombs.","To be religious is to have one\'s attention fixed on God and on one\'s neighbour in relation to God.","To walk out of his will is to walk into nowhere.","We are...a Divine work of art, something that God is making...something with which He will not be satisfied until it has a certain character.","I was with book, as a woman is with child.","The pain I feel now is the happiness I had before. That\'s the deal.","The modern State exists not to protect our rights but to do us good or make us good - anyway, to do something to us or to make us something. Hence the new name \'leaders\' for those who were once \'rulers\'. We are less their subjects than their wards, pupils, or domestic animals. There is nothing left of which we can say to them, \'Mind your own business.\' Our whole lives are their business.","Her absence is like the sky, spread over everything. But no, that is not quite accurate. There is one place where her absence comes locally home to me, and it is a place I can\'t avoid. I mean my own body. It had such a different importance while it was the body of H.\'s lover. Now it\'s like an empty house.","It is when we notice the dirt that God is most present in us; it is the very sign of His presence.","To enter heaven is to become more human than you ever succeeded in being on earth; to enter hell is to be banished from humanity. What is cast (or casts itself) into hell is not a man: it is \'remains.\'","If we cut up beasts simply because they cannot prevent us and because we are backing our own side in the struggle for existence, it is only logical to cut up imbeciles, criminals, enemies, or capitalists for the same reasons.","The most precious gift that marriage gave me was the constant impact of something very close and intimate, yet all the time unmistakably other, resistant - in a word, real.","We must get over wanting to be needed-this is the hardest of all temptations to resist","Enemy occupied territory is what the world is.","The happiness which God designs for his higher creatures is the happiness of being freely, voluntarily united to him.","Because we love something else more than this world, we love even this world more than those who know no other.","A dogmatic belief in objective value is necessary to the very idea of a rule which is not tyranny or an obedience which is not slavery.","Nothing, not even the best and noblest, can go on as it now is. Nothing, not even what is lowest and most bestial, will not be raised again if it submits to death. It is sown a natural body, it is raised a spiritual body. Flesh and blood cannot come to the Mountains [heaven]. Not because they are too rank, but because they are too weak. What is a Lizard compared with a stallion? Lust is a poor, weak, whimpering whispering thing compared with that richness and energy of desire which will arise when lust has been killed.","In silence and in meditation on the eternal truths, I hear the voice of God which excites our hearts to greater love.","Not my idea of God, but God. Not my idea of H., but H. Yes, and also not my idea of my neighbour, but my neighbour. For don\'t we often make this mistake as regards people who are still alive -- who are with us in the same room? Talking and acting not to the man himself but to the picture -- almost the pr\xe9cis -- we\'ve made of him in our own minds? And he has to depart from it pretty widely before we even notice the fact.","The great thing with unhappy times is to take them bit by bit, hour by hour, like an illness. It is seldom the present, the exact present, that is unbearable.","Never use abstract nouns when concrete ones will do. If you mean \u201cMore people died\u201d don\u2019t say \u201cMortality rose.","There is, hidden or flaunted, a sword between the sexes till an entire marriage reconciles them.","Safety and happiness can only come from individuals, classes, and nations being honest and fair and kind to each other.","When the author walks on the stage the play is over. God is going to invade, all right...something so beautiful to some of us and so terrible to others that none of us will have any choice left? For this time it will be God without disguise...it will be too late then to choose your side. There is no use saying you choose to lie down when it has become impossible to stand up.","I have been trying to make the reader believe that we actually are, at present, creatures whose character must be, in some respects, a horror to God, as it is, when we really see it, a horror to ourselves. This I believe to be a fact: and I notice that the holier a man is, the more fully he is aware of that fact.","It is a serious thing to live in a society of possible Gods and Goddesses. To remember that the dullest, and most uninteresting person you can talk to may one day be a creature which, if you saw it now, you would be strongly tempted to worship.","Imagine yourself as a living house.","Always prefer the plain direct word to the long, vague one.","No man knows how bad he is till he has tried very hard to be good...Only those who try to resist temptation know how strong it is.","I willingly believe that the damned are, in one sense, successful, rebels to the end; that the doors of hell are locked on the inside.","How incessant and great are the ills with which a prolonged old age is replete.","Once the feet are put right, all the rest of him will follow.","We can conceive of a world in which God corrected the results of abuse of free will by His creatures: so that a wooden beam became soft as grass when used as a weapon... But such a world would be one in which wrong actions were impossible, and therefore, freedom of the will would be void.","[M]an has been accustomed, ever since he was a boy, to having a dozen incompatible philosophies dancing about together inside his head. He doesn\'t think of doctrines as primarily \\"true\\" or \\"false,\\" but as \\"academic\\" or \\"practical,\\" \\"outworn\\" or \\"contemporary,\\" \\"conventional\\" or \\"ruthless.\\" Jargon, not argument, is your best ally in keeping him from the Church. Don\'t waste time trying to make him think that materialism is true! Make him think it is strong or stark or courageous\u2014that it is the philosophy of the future. That\'s the sort of thing he cares about.","The greatest evil is not done in those sordid dens of evil that Dickens loved to paint ... but is conceived and ordered (moved, seconded, carried, and minuted) in clear, carpeted, warmed, well-lighted offices, by quiet men with white collars and cut fingernails and smooth-shaven cheeks who do not need to raise their voices.","Friendship is born at that moment when one man says to another: \\"What! You too? I thought that no one but myself . . .\\"","The idea which...shuts out the Second Coming from our minds, the idea of the world slowly ripening to perfection, is a myth, not a generalization from experience.","I think God wants us to love Him more, not to love others less.","Need-love says of a woman \\"I cannot live without her\\"; Gift-love longs to give her happiness, comfort, protection - if possible, wealth; Appreciative love gazes and holds its breath and is silent, rejoices that such a wonder should exist even if not for him, will not be wholly dejected by losing her, would rather have it so than never to have seen her at all.","Shut your mouth; open your eyes and ears.","We may note in passing that He (Jesus) was never regarded as a mere moral teacher. He did not produce that effect on any of the people who actually met Him. He produced mainly three effects - Hatred - Terror - Adoration. There was no trace of people expressing mild admiration.","Isn\'t it absolutely essential to keep a fierce Left and fierce Right, both on their toes and each terrified of the other? That\'s how we get things done.","It means that though the Witch knew the Deep Magic, there is a magic deeper still that she did not know. Her knowledge goes back only to the dawn of Time. But if she could have looked a little further back, into the stillness and darkness before Time began, she would have read there a different incantation. She would have known that when a willing victim who had committed no treachery was killed in a traitor\'s stead, the Table would crack and death itself would work backwards.","You can put this another way by saying that while in other sciences the instruments you use are things external to yourself (things like microscopes and telescopes), the instrument through which you see God is your whole self. And if a man\'s self is not kept clean and bright, his glimpse of God will be blurred - like the Moon seen through a dirty telescope. That is why horrible nations have horrible religions: they have been looking at God through a dirty lens.","Pain is God\'s megaphone to rouse a deaf world.","Hell begins with a grumbling mood, always complaining, always blaming others.","We are born helpless. As soon as we are fully conscious we discover loneliness.","How monotonously alike all the great tyrants and conquerors have been: how gloriously different are the saints.","The process of living seems to consist in coming to realize truths so ancient and simple that, if stated, they sound like barren platitudes.","While friendship has been by far the chief source of my happiness, acquaintance or general society has always meant little to me, and I cannot quite understand why a man should wish to know more people than he can make real friends of.","I have no duty to be anyone\'s Friend and no man in the world has a duty to be mine. No claims, no shadow of necessity. Friendship is unnecessary, like philosophy, like art, like the universe itself (for God did not need to create). It has no survival value; rather it is one of those things which give value to survival.","Our prayers for others flow more easily than those for ourselves.  This shows we are made to live by charity.","The event of falling in love... in one high bound it has overleaped the massive wall of our selfhood; it has made appetite itself altruistic, tossed personal happiness aside as a triviality and planted the interests of another in the centre of our being.","Now the story of Christ is simply a true myth: a myth working on us the same way as the others, but with this tremendous difference that it really happened: and one must be content to accept it in the same way, remembering that it is God\u2019s myth where the others are men\u2019s myths: i.e., the Pagan stories are God expressing Himself through the minds of poets, using such images as He found there, while Christianity is God expressing Himself through what we call \'real things\'.","Christianity is a fighting religion.","God has landed on this enemy-occupied world in human form...The perfect surrender and humiliation was undergone by Christ: perfect because He was God, surrender and humiliation because He was man.","The typical expression of opening Friendship would be something like, \'What? You too? I thought I was the only one!","Let\'s pray that the human race never escapes from Earth to spread its iniquity elsewhere.","A man can eat his dinner without understanding exactly how food nourishes him. A man can accept what Christ has done without knowing how it works: indeed, he certainly would not know how it works until he has accepted it.","He is not the soul of Nature, nor any part of Nature. He inhabits eternity: He dwells in a high and holy place: heaven is His throne, not his vehicle, earth is his footstool, not his vesture. One day he will dismantle both and make a new heaven and earth. He is not to be identified even with the \'divine spark\' in man. He is \'God and not man.","We were promised sufferings. They were part of the program. We were even told, \'Blessed are they that mourn,\' and I accept it. I\'ve got nothing that I hadn\'t bargained for. Of course it is different when the thing happens to oneself, not to others, and in reality, not imagination.","I believe, to be sure, that any man who reaches Heaven will find that what he abandoned (even in plucking out his right eye) has not been lost: that the kernel of what he was really seeking even in his most depraved wishes will be there, beyond expectation, waiting for him in \'the High Countries\'.","No philosophical theory which I have yet come across is a radical improvement on the words of Genesis, that \'In the beginning God made Heaven and Earth\'.","To make Christianity a private affair while banishing all privacy is to relegate it to the rainbow\'s end or the Greek Calends.","The central miracle asserted by Christians is the incarnation. They say that God became man.","We cannot fully understand the relations of time and choice until we are beyond both.","Your patient has become humble; have you drawn his attention to the fact? All virtues are less formidable to us once the man is aware that he has them, but this is specially true of humility.","Better to be miserable with her than happy without her. Let our hearts break provided they break together. If the voice within us does not say this it is not the voice of Eros.","Beauty is not democratic; she reveals herself more to the few than to the many.","According to Christian teachers, the essential vice, the utmost evil, is Pride.","It is a good rule after reading a new book, never to allow yourself another new one till you have read an old one in between.","Not that I am (I think) in much danger of ceasing to believe in God. The real danger is of coming to believe such dreadful things about Him. The conclusion I dread is not \'So there\'s no God after all,\' but \'So this is what God\'s really like. Deceive yourself no longer.","I have often repented of speech but hardly ever of silence.","Faith, in the sense in which I am here using the word, is the art of holding on to things your reason has once accepted, in spite of your changing moods.","No, I don\u2019t wish I knew Heaven was like the picture in my Great Divorce, because, if we knew that, we should know it was no better. The good things even of this world are far too good ever to be reached by imagination. Even the common orange, you know: no one could have imagined it before he tasted it. How much less Heaven.","It is hard to have patience with people who say \'There is no death\' or \'Death doesn\'t matter.\' There is death. And whatever is matters. And whatever happens has consequences, and it and they are irrevocable and irreversible. You might as well say that birth doesn\'t matter.","At the end of all things, the blessed will say, \'We never lived anywhere but in heaven.\'","If we really think that home is elsewhere and that this life is a wandering to find home, why should we not look forward to the arrival?","Theocracy is the worst of all governments. If we must have a tyrant, a robber baron is far better than an inquisitor. The baron\'s cruelty may sometimes sleep, his cupidity at some point be sated; and since he dimly knows he is doing wrong he may possibly repent. But the inquisitor who mistakes his own cruelty and lust of power and fear for the voice of Heaven will torment us infinitely because he torments us with the approval of his own conscience and his better impulses appear to him as temptations.","\\"Welcome, Prince,\\" said Aslan. \\"Do you feel yourself sufficient to take up the Kingship of Narnia?\\" \\n\\"I - I don\'t think I do, Sir,\\" said Caspian. \\"I\'m only a kid.\\" \\n\\"Good,\\" said Aslan. \\"If you had felt yourself sufficient, it would have been a proof that you were not.\\"","But why,... if you have a serious comment to make on the real life of men, must you do it by talking about a phantasmagoric never-never land of your own? Because, I take it, one of the main things the author wants to say is that the real life of men is of that mythical and heroic quality.","Don\'t use words too big for the subject. Don\'t say \'infinitely\' when you mean \'very\'; otherwise you\'ll have no word left when you want to talk about something really infinite.","Thus we have now for many centuries triumphed over nature to the extent of making certain secondary characteristics of the male (such as the beard) disagreeable to nearly all the females\u2014and there is more in that than you might suppose.","If and when a horror turns up you will then be given Grace to help you. I don\'t think one is usually given it in advance. \\"Give us our daily bread\\" (not an annuity for life) applies to spiritual gifts too; the little daily support for the daily trial. Life has to be taken day by day and hour by hour.","I wish I were younger. What inclines me now to think you may be right in regarding [evolution] as the central and radical lie in the whole web of falsehood that now governs our lives is not so much your arguments against it as the fanatical and twisted attitudes of its defenders.","That is what mortals misunderstand. They say of some temporal sufferring, \\"No future bliss can make up for it\\" not knowing that Heaven, once attained, will work backwards and turn even that agony into a glory.","The first demand any work of art makes upon us is to surrender. Look. Listen. Receive. Get yourself out of the way.","Something deep in the human heart breaks at the thought of a life of mediocrity.","Friendship exhibits a glorious \\"nearness by resemblance\\" to Heaven itself where the very multitude of the blessed (which no man can number) increases the fruition which each has of God. For every soul, seeing Him in her own way, doubtless communicates that unique vision to all the rest. That, says an old author, is why the Seraphim in Isaiah\'s vision are crying \\"Holy, Holy, Holy\\" to one another (Isaiah VI, 3). The more we thus share the Heavenly Bread between us, the more we shall all have.","Don\'t you understand anything?  Isn\'t it absolutely essential to keep a fierce Left and a fierce Right, both on their toes and each terrified of the other?  That\'s how we get things done.  Any opposition to the N.I.C.E. is represented as a Left racket in the Right papers and a Right racket in the Left papers.  If it\'s properly done, you get each side outbidding the other in support of us-to refute the enemy slanders.  Of course we\'re non-political.  The real power always is.","No one ever told me that grief felt so like fear.","No book is really worth reading at the age of ten which is not equally \u2013 and often far more \u2013 worth reading at the age of fifty and beyond.","As long as you are proud, you cannot know God.","Suppose... suppose we have only dreamed and made up these things like sun, sky, stars, and moon, and Aslan himself. In that case, it seems to me that the made-up things are a good deal better than the real ones. And if this black pits of a kingdom is the best you can make, then it\'s a poor world. And we four can make a dream world to lick your real one hollow.","Fallen man is not simply an imperfect creature who needs improvement: he is a rebel who must lay down his arms. Laying down your arms, surrendering, saying you are sorry, realizing that you have been on the wrong track and getting ready to start life over again from the ground floor-that is the only way out of a \\"hole.\\" This process of surrender-this movement full speed astern-is repentance.","We know we are sinners, it does not follow that we are saved.","We can rest contentedly in our sins and in our stupidities, and anyone who has watched gluttons shoveling down the most exquisite foods as if they did not know what they were eating will admit that we can ignore even pleasure. But pain insists upon being attended to. God whispers to us in our pleasures, speaks in our consciences, but shouts in our pains. It is his megaphone to rouse a deaf world.","When we want to be something other than the thing that God wants us to be, we must be wanting what, in fact, will not make us happy...whether we like it or not, God intends to give us what we need, not what we now think we want. Once more, we are embarrassed by the intolerable compliment, by too much love, not too little.","Grief ... gives life a permanently provisional feeling. It doesn\'t seem worth starting anything. I can\'t settle down. I yawn, I fidget, I smoke too much. Up till this I always had too little time. Now there is nothing but time. Almost pure time, empty successiveness.","Even when I feared and detested Christianity, I was struck by its essential unity, which, in spite of its divisions, it has never lost. I trembled on recognizing the same unmistakable aroma coming from the writings of Dante and Bunyan, Thomas Aquinas and William Law.","If only this toothache would go away, I could write another chapter on the problem of pain.","We must learn by experience to avoid either trains of thought or social situations which for us (not necessarily for everyone) lead to temptations. Like motoring-don\'t wait till the last moment before you put on the brakes but put them on, gently and quietly, while the danger is still a good way off.","Well, you know how it feels if you begin hoping for something that you want desperately badly; you almost fight against the hope because it is too good to be true; you\'ve been disappointed so often before.","The human spirit will not even begin to try to surrender self-will as long as all seems to be well with it. Now error and sin both have this property, that the deeper they are the less their victim suspects their existence; they are masked evil. Pain is unmasked, unmistakable evil; every man knows that something is wrong when he is being hurt.","Above all else , the devil can not stand to be mocked.","Wrong will be right, when Aslan comes in sight, At the sound of his roar, sorrows will be no more, When he bares his teeth, winter meets its death, And when he shakes his mane, we shall have spring again.","A children\'s story that can only be enjoyed by children is not a good children\'s story in the slightest.","It takes all sorts to make a world; or a church. This may be even truer of a church. If grace perfects nature it must expand all our natures into the full richness of the diversity which God intended when He made them, and Heaven will display far more variety than Hell.","What we have been told is how we men can be drawn into Christ-can become part of that wonderful present which the young Prince of the universe wants to offer to His Father-that present which is Himself and therefore us in Him. It is the only thing we were made for. And there are strange, exciting hints in the Bible that when we are drawn in, a great many other things in Nature will begin to come right. The bad dream will be over: it will be morning.","Dyson and Tolkien were the immediate human causes of my conversion. Is any pleasure on earth as great as a circle of Christian friends by a good fire?","No emotion is, in itself, a judgement; in that sense all emotions and sentiments are alogical. but they can be reasonable or unreasonable as they conform to Reason or fail to conform. The heart never takes the place of the head: but it can, and should, obey it.","Aravis also had many quarrels (and, I\'m afraid, even fights) with Cor, but they always made it up again: so that years later, when they were grown up, they were so used to quarrelling and making it up again that they got married so as to go on doing it more conveniently.","A sick society must think much about politics, as a sick man must think much about his digestion.","People talk as if grief were just a feeling -- as if it weren\'t the continually renewed shock of setting out again and again on familiar roads and being brought up short by the grim frontier post that now blocks them.","Some day you will be old enough to start reading fairy tales again.","Critics who treat adult as a term of approval, instead of as a merely descriptive term, cannot be adult themselves.","Affection would not be affection if it was loudly and frequently expressed; to produce it in public is like getting your household furniture out for a move. It did very well in its place, but it looks shabby or tawdry or grotesque in the sunshine.","It is by human avarice or human stupidity, not by the churlishness of nature, that we have poverty and overwork.","To move with the times is, of course, to go where all times go.","As to...old composers like Schubert or Beethoven, I imagine that, while modern music expresses both feeling, thought and imagination, they expressed pure feeling. And you know all day sitting at work, eating, walking, etc., you have hundreds of feelings that can\'t be put into words. And that is why I think that in a sense music is the highest of the arts, because it really begins where the others leave off.","He who has not forgiven an enemy has never yet tasted one of the most sublime enjoyments of life.","...this new idea of cure instead of punishment, so humane in seeming, had in fact deprived the criminal of all rights and by taking away the name Punishment made the thing infinite.","The thing is to rely on God. The time will come when you will regard all this misery as a small price to pay for having been brought to that dependence. Meanwhile, the trouble is that relying on God has to begin all over again every day as if nothing has yet been done.","For the wise men of old the cardinal problem had been how to conform the soul to reality. For magic and applied science alike the problem is how to subdue reality to the wishes of men.","The rule of the universe is that others can do for us what we cannot do for ourselves, and one can paddle every canoe except one\'s own.","Long before history began we men have got together apart from the women and done things. We had time.","There was a boy called Eustace Clarence Scrubb, and he almost deserved it.","She\'s the sort of woman who lives for others - you can tell the others by their hunted expression.","My own eyes are not enough for me; I will see through those of others.","The man is a humbug \u2014 a vulgar, shallow, self-satisfied mind, absolutely inaccessible to the complexities and delicacies of the real world. He has the journalist\'s air of being a specialist in everything, of taking in all points of view and being always on the side of the angels: he merely annoys a reader who has the least experience of knowing things, of what knowing is like. There is not two pence worth of real thought or real nobility in him. But he isn\'t dull.","I became my own only when I gave myself to Another.","It would seem that Our Lord finds our desires not too strong, but too weak.","To the glistening Eastern sea, I give you Queen Lucy, the Valiant. To the great Western Wood, King Edmund the Just. To the radiant Southern sun, Queen Susan, the Gentle; and to the clear Northern sky I give you King Peter, the Magnificent. Once a king or queen of Narnia, always a king or queen. May your wisdom grace us \'til the stars rain down from the heavens.","Those who cannot conceive of Friendship as a substantive love but only as a disguise or elaboration of Eros betray the fact that they have never had a Friend.","and a charge of lying against someone whom you have always found truthful is a very serious thing; a very serious thing indeed.","Children have one kind of silliness, as you know, and grown-ups have another kind.","You have not chosen one another, but I have chosen you for one another.","Life isn\'t all fricasseed frogs and eel pie.","Do not by any means destroy yourself, for if you live you may yet have good fortune, but all the dead are dead like.","They did nothing wrong their time here has ended","I have been wandering to find him and my happiness is so great that it even weakens me like a wound. And this is the marvel of marvels, that he called me Beloved, me who am but as a dog.","He wants them to learn to walk and must therefore take away His hand.","I have come,\\" said a deep voice behind them. They turned and saw the Lion himself, so bright and real and strong that everything else began at once to look pale and shadowy compared with him.","Theology offers you a working arrangement, which leaves the scientist free to continue his experiments and the Christian to continue his prayers.","Christianity does not involve the belief that all things were made for man. it does involve the belief that god loves man and for his sake became man and died.","We are finite and God will not call us everywhere or to support every worthy cause. And real needs are not far from us.","Literature adds to reality, it does not simply describe it.","That part of Rostrevor which overlooks Carlingford Lough is my idea of Narnia.","And the seriousness with which the other party takes my words always raises the doubt whether I have taken them seriously enough myself.","All your life an unattainable ecstasy has hovered just beyond the grasp of your consciousness.","Reason is the natural order of truth; but imagination is the organ of meaning.","Eating and reading are two pleasures that combine admirably.","Now the trouble about trying to make yourself stupider than you really are is that you very often succeed.","Literary experience heals the wound, without undermining the privilege, of individuality.","We\'re free Narnians, Hwin and I, and I suppose, if you\'re running away to Narnia you want to be one too. In that case Hwin isn\'t your horse any longer. One might just as well say you\'re her human.","Further up and further in!","You come of the Lord Adam and the Lady Eve,\\" said Aslan. \\"And that is both honour enough to erect the head of the poorest beggar, and shame enough to bow the shoulders of the greatest emperor on earth. Be content.","The demand of the loveless and the self-imprisoned that they should be allowed to blackmail the universe: that till they consent to be happy (on their own terms) no one else shall taste joy: that theirs should be the final power; that Hell should be able to veto Heaven.","In those days Mr. Sherlock Holmes was still living in Baker Street and the Bastables were looking for treasure in the Lewisham Road.","Lucy looked and saw that Aslan had just breathed on the feet of the stone giant. It\'s all right!\\" shouted Aslan joyously. \\"Once The feet are put right, all the rest of him will follow.","Oh, Adam\u2019s sons, how cleverly you defend yourselves against all that might do you good!","Music. A meaningless acceleration in the rhythm of celestial experience.","It is a very funny thing that the sleepier you are, the longer you take about getting to bed.","The love of knowledge is a kind of madness.","Like a good chess player, Satan is always trying to maneuver you into a position where you can save your castle only by losing your bishop.","I hope no one who reads this book has been quite as miserable as Susan and Lucy were that night; but if you have been - if you\'ve been up all night and cried till you have no more tears left in you - you will know that there comes in the end a sort of quietness. You feel as if nothing is ever going to happen again.","And I say also this. I do not think the forest would be so bright, nor the water so warm, nor love so sweet, if there were no danger in the lakes.","Badness is only spoiled goodness.","The cross comes before the crown and tomorrow is a Monday morning!","Novelty may fix our attention not even on the service but on the celebrant. You know what I mean. Try as one may to exclude it, the question \\"What on earth is he up to now?\\" will intrude. It lays one\'s devotion waste. There is really some excuse for the man who said, \\"I wish they\'d remember that the charge to Peter was Feed my sheep; not Try experiments on my rats, or even, Teach my performing dogs new tricks.","And so for a time it looked as if all the adventures were coming to and end; but that was not to be.","No justification of virtue will enable a man to be virtuous. Without the aid of trained emotions the intellect is powerless against the animal organism. I had sooner play cards against a man who was quite skeptical about ethics, but bred to believe that \u2018a gentleman does not cheat\u2019, than against an irreproachable moral philosopher who had been brought up among sharpers.","In great literature, I become a thousand different men but still remain myself.","The very first tear he made was so deep that I thought it had gone right into my heart.","Tea should be taken in solitude.","There comes a moment when people who have been dabbling in religion (\'man\'s search for God\'!) suddenly draw back. Supposing we really found Him? We never meant it to come to that! Worse still, supposing He had found us?","There must, whether the gods see it or not, be something great in the mortal soul. For suffering, it seems, is infinite, and our capacity without limit.","A voice had begun to sing. It was very far away and Digory found it hard to decide from what direction it was coming. Sometimes it seemed to come from all directions at once. Sometimes he almost thought it was coming out of the earth beneath them. Its lower notes were deep enough to be the voice of the earth herself. There were no words. It was hardly a tune. But it was beyond comparison, the most beautiful sound he had ever heard.","The modern habit of doing ceremonial things unceremoniously is no proof of humility; rather it proves the offender\'s inability to forget himself in the rite, and his readiness to spoil for every one else the proper pleasure of ritual.","What began the change was the very writing itself. Let no one lightly set about such a work. Memory, once waked, will play the tyrant.","That thing is Freedom: the gift whereby ye most resemble your Maker and are yourselves part of eternal reality.","It has actually become very necessary in our time to rebut the theory that every firm and serious friendship is really homosexual.","We were made to be neither cerebral men nor visceral men, but Men. Not beasts nor angels but Men - things at once rational and animal.","No one can teach riding so well as a horse.","If He who in Himself can lack nothing, chooses to need us, it is because we need to be needed.","The proper rewards are not simply tacked on to the activity for which they are given, but are the activity itself in consummation.","Perfect humility dispenses with modesty.","The modern idea of a Great Man is one who stands at the lonely extremity of some single line of development--","You have gone into the Temple...and found Him, as always, there.","When God becomes a Man and lives as a creature among His own creatures in Palestine, then indeed His life is one of supreme self-sacrifice and leads to Calvary.","The higher animals are in a sense drawn into Man when he loves them and makes them (as he does) much more nearly human than they would otherwise be.","...we sacrifice other species to our own not because our own has any objective metaphysical privilege over others, but simply because it is ours. It may be very natural to have this loyalty to our own species, but let us hear no more from the naturalists about the \\"sentimentality\\" of anti-vivisectionists. If loyalty to our own species - preference for man simply because we are men - is not sentiment, then what is?","We sit down before the picture in order to have something done to us, not that we may do things with it. The first demand any work of art makes upon us is surrender. Look. Listen. Receive. Get yourself out of the way (there is no good asking first whether the work before you deserves such a surrender, for until you have surrendered you cannot possibly find out.","Even I never dreamed of Magic like this!","She did not shut it properly because she knew that it is very silly to shut oneself into a wardrobe, even if it is not a magic one.","He liked books if they were books of information and had pictures of grain elevators or of fat foreign children doing exercises in model schools.","Ah, you\'ve come over the water. Powerful wet stuff, ain\'t it?","Aslan\'s instructions always work; there are no exceptions.","Man, even now, can do wonders to animals: my cat and dog live together in my house and seem to like it. It may have been one of man\'s functions to restore peace to the animal world, and if he had not joined the enemy he might have succeeded in doing so to an extent now hardly imaginable.","You asked for a loving God: you have one... The consuming fire Himself, the Love that made the worlds, persistent as the artist\'s love for his work and despotic as a man\'s love for a dog, provident and venerable as a father\'s love for a child, jealous, inexorable, exacting as love between the sexes. How this should be, I do not know: it passes reason to explain why any creatures, not to say creatures such as we, should have a value so prodigious in their Creator\'s eyes.","Feelings, and feelings, and feelings. Let me try thinking instead.","Courage is not simply one of the virtues, but the form of every virtue at the testing point, which means, at the point of highest reality. A chastity or honesty or mercy which yields to danger will be chaste or honest or merciful only on conditions. Pilate was merciful till it became risky.","Puddleglum\'s my name. But it doesn\'t matter if you forget it. I can always tell you again.","Growing maturity is marked by the increasing liberties we take with our travelling... we made the discovery (some people never make it) that real books can be taken on a journey and that hours of golden reading can so be added to its other delights.","All their life in this world and all their adventures had only been the cover and the title page: now at last they were beginning Chapter One of the Great Story which no one on earth has read: which goes on for ever: in which every chapter is better than the one before.","The only way to drive out bad culture is to create good culture. We need to recognize that artistic talent is a gift from the Lord - and that developing those talents is the only way to create good culture.","Man\'s conquest of Nature, if the dreams of some scientific planners are realized, means the rule of a few hundreds of men over billions upon billions of men. There neither is nor can be any simple increase of power on Man\'s side. Each new power won by man is a power over man as well.","There is nothing like suspense and anxiety for barricading a human\'s mind against the Enemy. He wants men to be concerned with what they do; our business is to keep them thinking about what will happen to them.","You and I who still enjoy fairy tales have less reason to wish actual childhood back. We have kept its pleasures and added some grown-up ones as well.","I have always at least, ever since I can remember had a kind of longing for death.","Whatever men expect, they soon come to think they have a right to; the sense of disappointment can, with very little skill on our part, be turned into a sense of injury. (senior devil speaking)","Our merriment must be of that kind (and it is, in fact, the merriest kind) which exists between people who have, from the outset, taken each other seriously - no flippancy, no superiority, no presumption. And our charity must be a real and costly love, with deep feeling for the sins in spite of which we love the sinner - no mere tolerance or indulgence which parodies love as flippancy parodies merriment.","To love you as I should, I must worship God as Creator. When I have learnt to love God better than my earthly dearest, I shall love my earthly dearest better than I do now. In so far as I learn to love my earthly dearest at the expense of God and instead of God, I shall be moving towards the state in which I shall not love my earthly dearest t all. When first things are put first, second things are not suppressed bu increased.","Your people eat dry and tasteless flesh but it is off plates as smooth as ivory and as round as the sun.","The humans live in time but our Enemy destines them to eternity. He therefore, I believe, wants them to attend chiefly to two things, to eternity itself, and to that point of time which they call the Present. For the Present is the point at which time touches eternity. Of the present moment, and of it only, humans have an experience analogous to the experience which our Enemy has of reality of whole; in it alone freedom and actuality are offered to them.","Each time you fall He\'ll pick you up. He knows your own efforts are never going to bring you anywhere near perfection","Some people talk as if meeting the gaze of absolute goodness would be fun. They need to think again.","I must keep alive in myself the desire for my true country, which I shall not find till after death; I must never let it get snowed under or turned aside; I must make it the main object of life to press on to that other country and to help others to do the same.","If all experienced God in the same way and returned Him an identical worship, the song of the Church triumphant would have no symphony, it would be played like an orchestra in which all instruments played the same note.","We feasted on love; every mode of it, solemn and merry, romantic and realistic, sometimes as dramatic as a thunderstorm, sometimes comfortable and unemphatic as putting on your soft slippers. She was my pupil and my teacher, my subject and my sovereign, my trusty comrade, friends, shipmate, fellow-soldier. My mistress, but at the same time all that any man friend has ever been to me.","The search for a \\"suitable\\" church makes the man a critic where God wants him to be a pupil. What he wants from the layman in church is an attitude which may, indeed, be critical in the sense of rejecting what is false or unhelpful but which is wholly uncritical in the sense that it does not appraise- does not waste time in thinking about what it rejects, but lays itself open in uncommenting, humble receptivity to any nourishment that is going.","One of our great allies at present is the Church itself. Do not misunderstand me. I do not mean the Church as we see her spread out through all time and space and rooted in eternity, terrible as an army with banners. That, I confess, is a spectacle which makes our boldest tempters uneasy. But fortunately it is quite invisible to these humans.","All your life an unattainable ecstasy has hovered just beyond the grasp of your consciousness. The day is coming when you will wake to find, beyond all hope, that you have attained it, or else, that it was within your reach and you have lost it forever.","Everyone who believes in God at all believes that he knows what you and I are going to do tomorrow.","The world does not need more Christian literature. What it needs is more Christians writing good literature.","Children are not deceived by fairy-tales; they are often and gravely deceived by school-stories. Adults are not deceived by science-fiction ; they can be deceived by the stories in the women\'s magazines.","Nothing is yet in its true form.","When things go wrong, you\'ll find they usually go on getting worse for some time; but when things once start going right they often go on getting better and better.","Notice how we are perpetually surprised at Time. (\'How time flies! Fancy John being grown-up and married! I can hardly believe it!\') In heavens name, why? Unless, indeed, there is something in us which is not temporal.","If Christianity is untrue, then no honest man will want to believe it, however helpful it might be; if it is true, every honest man will want to believe it, even if it gives him no help at all","You ask \u2018for what\u2019 God wants you. Isn\u2019t the primary answer that He wants you. We\u2019re not told that the lost sheep was sought out for anything except itself [Matthew 18:12-14; Luke 15:3-7]. Of course, He may have a special job for you: and the certain job is that of becoming more and more His.","The hardness of God is kinder than the softness of men, and His compulsion is our liberation.","The only things we can keep are the things we freely give to God. What we try to keep for ourselves is just what we are sure to lose.","... believing in a God whom we cannot but regard as evil, and then, in mere terrified flattery calling Him \'good\' and worshipping him is a still greater danger... The ultimate question is whether the doctrine of the goodness of God or that of the inerrancy of scripture is to prevail when they conflict. I think the doctrine of the goodness of God is the more certain of the two. Indeed, only that doctrine renders this worship of Him obligatory or even permissable.","Miracles are for beginners.","It is easy to acknowledge, but almost impossible to realize for long, that we are mirrors whose brightness, if we are bright, is wholly derived from the sun that shines upon us.","A man who was merely a man and said the sort of things Jesus said would not be a great moral teacher. He would either be a lunatic - on a level with the man who says he is a poached egg - or else he would be the Devil of Hell. You must make your choice. Either this man was, and is, the Son of God; or else a madman or something worse. You can shut him up for a fool; you can spit at him and kill him as a demon; or you can fall at his feet and call him Lord and God. But let us not come with any patronizing nonsense about his being a great human teacher. He has not left that open to us.","I do not think that all who choose wrong roads perish; but their rescue consists in being put back on the right road.","To love is to be vulnerable.","We were made not primarily that we may love God, but that God may love us.","You are certainly under the guidance of the Holy Ghost or you wouldn\'t have come where you now are.","Failures are finger posts on the road to achievement.","The future is something which everyone reaches at the rate of 60 minutes an hour, whatever he does, whoever he is.","Nothing that you have not given away will ever be really yours.","If you are a Christian you do not have to believe that all the other religions are simply wrong all through. If you are an atheist you do have to believe that the main point in all the religions of the whole world is simply one huge mistake.","The lost enjoy forever the horrible freedom they have demanded.","If conversion makes no improvements in a man\'s outward actions then I think his \'conversion\' was largely imaginary.","If education is beaten by training, civilization dies.","You can make anything by writing.","What do they teach them at these schools?","All that is not eternal is eternally out of date.","You must picture me alone in that room in Magdalen, night after night, feeling, whenever my mind lifted even for a second from my work, the steady, unrelenting approach of Him whom I so earnestly desired not to meet. That which I greatly feared had at last come upon me. In the Trinity Term of 1929 I gave in, and admitted that God was God, and knelt and prayed: perhaps, that night, the most dejected and reluctant convert in all England.","Something quite unexpected has happened. It came this morning early. For various reasons, not in themselves at all mysterious, my heart was lighter than it had been for many weeks. ... And suddenly, at the very moment when, so far, I mourned H. least, I remembered her best. Indeed it was something (almost) better than memory; an instantaneous, unanswerable impression. To say it was like a meeting would be going too far. Yet there was that in it which tempts one to use those words. It was as though the lifting of the sorrow removed a barrier.","Our passions are not too strong, they are too weak. We are far too easily pleased.","I thought I could describe a state; make a map of sorrow. Sorrow, however, turns out to be not a state, but a process. It needs not a map, but a history, and if I don\'t stop writing that history at some quite arbitrary point, there\'s no reason why I should ever stop.","One must never be either content with, or impatient with, oneself.","With the possible exception of the equator, everything begins somewhere.","Child,\' said the Lion, \'I am telling you your story, not hers. No one is told any story but their own.","The Psalmists in telling everyone to praise God are doing what all men do when they speak of what they care about.","I never exactly made a book. It\'s rather like taking dictation. I was given things to say.","Write about what really interests you, whether it is real things or imaginary things, and nothing else.","So many things--nay every real thing--is good if only it will be humble and ordinate.","God has paid us the intolerable compliment of loving us, in the deepest, most tragic, most inexorable sense.","Some journeys take us far from home. Some adventures lead us to our destiny.","I believe that there are too many practitioners in the church, who are not believers.","Every contact you make with everyone you meet will help them or hinder them on their journey to heaven.","The beauty of life, is that you don\'t have to be modernly beautiful to live it.","Laziness means more work in the long run.","For the Christian, there are, strictly speaking, no chances. A secret Master of the Ceremonies has been at work.","Christ wants us to have a child\'s heart but a grown-up\'s head.","Everything is as good or bad as our opinion makes it.","Prosperity knits a man to the world. He feels that he is finding his place in it, while really it is finding its place in him.","If things are real, they\'re there all the time.","Nothing in Man is either worse or better for being shared with the beasts.","The harder you tried not to think, the more you thought.","We are not living in a world where all roads are radii if a circle and where all, if followed long enough, will therefore draw gradually nearer and finally meet at the centre: rather in a world where every road, after a few miles, forks into two, and each of those into two again, and at each fork you must make a decision.","I will not be at the mercy of the telephone!","How difficult it is to avoid having a special standard for oneself.","God can show Himself as He really is only to real men. And that means not simply to men who are individually good, but to men who are united together in a body, loving one another, helping one another, showing Him to one another. For that is what God meant humanity to be like; like players in one band, or organs in one body.","A moderately bad man knows he is not very good: a thoroughly bad man thinks he is alright. This is common sense really. You understand sleep when you are awake, not well you are sleeping.","No people find each other more absurd than lovers","If we let ourselves, we shall always be waiting for some distraction or other to end before we can really get down to our work. The only people who achieve much are those who want knowledge so badly that they seek it while the conditions are still unfavorable. Favorable conditions never come.","[Repentance] means unlearning all the self-conceit and self -will that we have been training ourselves into... It means killing part of yourself, under-going a kind of death.","When they have really learned to love their neighbours as themselves, they will be allowed to love themselves as their neighbours.","Death opens a door out of a little, dark room (that\'s all the life we have known before it) into a great, real place where the true sun shines and we shall meet.","No great wisdom can be reached without sacrifice.","Forgiving and being forgiven are two names for the same thing. The important thing is that a discord has been resolved.","We seek an enlargement of our being. We want to be more than ourselves . . . We want to see with other eyes, to imagine with other imaginations, to feel with other hearts, as well as with our own . . . We demand windows.","If Christianity is only one more bit of good advice, then Christianity is of no importance.","A man who has lived in many places is not likely to be deceived by the local errors of his native village; the scholar has lived in many times and is therefore in some degree immune from the great cataract of nonsense that pours from the press and the microphone of his own age.","Holiness is irresistible. If even 10% of the world\'s population had it the whole world would be converted and happy before the year\'s end.","We must show our Christian colors, if we are to be true to Jesus Christ. We cannot remain silent or concede everything away.","The humans live in time but our Enemy (God) destines them for eternity.","The Future is, of all things, the thing least like eternity. It is the most temporal part of time--for the Past is frozen and no longer flows, and the Present is all lit up with eternal rays.","An author should never conceive himself as bringing into existence beauty or wisdom which did not exist before, but simply and solely as trying to embody in terms of his own art some reflection of eternal Beauty and Wisdom.","In the same way a Christian is not a man who never goes wrong, but a man is enabled to repent and pick himself up and begin over again after each stumble--because the Christ-life is inside him, repairing him all the time, enabling him to repeat (in some degree) the kind of voluntary death which Christ Himself carried out.\\" - Mere Christianity","Your real, new self (which is Christ\'s and also yours, and yours just because it is His) will not come as long as you are looking for it. It will come when you are looking for Him.","We are told that Christ was killed for us, that His death has washed out our sins, and that by dying He disabled death itself. That is the formula. That is Christianity. That is what has to be believed.","As Christians we are tempted to make unnecessary concessions to those outside the faith. We give in too much. Now, I don\'t mean that we should run the risk of making a nuisance of ourselves by witnessing at improper times, but there comes a time when we must show that we disagree.","You Too? I thought I was the only one.","If there\'s anyone who can appear before Aslan without their knees knocking, they\'re either braver than most, or else just silly.","I\'d sooner live among people who don\'t cheat at cards than among people who are earnest about not cheating at cards.","I would prefer to battle the \'I\'m special\' feeling not by the thought, \'I\'m no more special than anyone else,\' by by the feeling, \'Everyone is as special as me.\'","We do not enjoy a story fully at the first reading. Not till the curiosity, the sheer narrative lust, has been given its sop and laid asleep, are we at leisure to savour the real beauties.","One always feel better when one has made up one\'s mind.","We don\'t have a soul. We are a soul. We happen to have a body.","The command \\"Be ye prfect\\" is not idealistic gas. Nor is it a command to do the impossible. He said (in the Bible) that we were \\"gods\\" and he is going to make good his words. He will make us into a god or goddess, a dazzling, radiant, immortal creature...a bright stainless mirror which reflects back to God perfectly.","Once you were a child. Once you knew what inquiry was for. There was a time when you asked questions because you wanted answers, and were glad when you had found them. Become a child again, even now... You have gone wrong. Thirst was made for water; inquiry for truth.","What we called love down there was mostly the craving to be loved. In the main I loved you for my own sake: because I needed you...We shall have no need for one another now: we can begin to love truly.","Literary Experience heals the wound, without undermining the privilege of individuality.. .Here, as in worship, in love, in moral action, and in knowing, I transcend myself; and am never more myself than when I do.","If we let ourselves, we shall always be waiting for some distraction or other to end before we can really get down to our work.","we follow One who stood and wept at the grave of Lazarus-not surely, because He was grieved that Mary and Martha wept, and sorrowed for their lack of faith (though some thus interpret) but because death, the punishment of sin, is even more horrible in his eyes than in ours.","Something of God... flows into us from the blue of the sky, the taste of honey, the delicious embrace of water whether cold or hot, and even from sleep itself.","The Guide sang: \\nThe new age, the new art, the new ethic and thought, \\nAnd fools crying, \\nBecause it has begun It will continue as it has begun! \\nThe wheel runs fast, therefore the wheel will run \\nFaster for ever, \\nThe old age is done, \\nWe have new lights and see without the sun. \\n(Though they lay flat the mountains and dry up the sea, \\nWilt thou yet change, as though God were a god?)","I think I am beginning to understand why grief feels like suspense. It comes from the frustration of so many impulses that had become habitual. Thought after thought feeling after feeling action after action had H. for their object. Now their target is gone. I keep on through habit fitting an harrow to the string then I remember and have to lay the bow down. So many roads lead through to H. I set out on one of them. But now there\'s an impassable frontier-post across it. So many roads once now so many culs de sac.","Man approaches God most nearly when he is in one sense least like God. For what can be more unlike than fullness and need, sovereignty and humility, righteousness and penitence, limitless power and a cry for help?","Most of us are not really approaching the subject in order to find out what Christianity says; we are approaching it in the hope of finding support from Christianity for the views of our own party.","We cannot understand. The best is perhaps what we understand least.","It is important early in life to acquire the power of reading sense wherever you happen to be.","That is the key to history. Terrific energy is expended - civilizations are built up - excellent institutions devised; but each time something goes wrong. Some fatal flaw always brings the selfish and cruel people to the top, and then it all slides back into misery and ruin. In fact, the machine conks. It seems to start up all right and runs a few yards, and then it breaks down.","Your book bill ought to be your biggest extravagance.","Good and evil both increase at compound interest.","Once a man is united to God, how could he not live forever?","Good, as it ripens, becomes continually more different not only from evil but from other good.","And men said that the blood of the stars flowed in her veins","Only a bad person needs to repent: only a good person can repent perfectly.","The very idea of freedom presupposes some objective moral law which overarches rulers and ruled alike...Unless we return to the crude and nursery-like belief in objective values, we perish.","Nothing can seem extraordinary until you have discovered what is ordinary.","By repenting, one acknowledges them as sins-therefore not to be repeated.","It isn\'t Narnia, you know,\\" sobbed Lucy. \\"It\'s you. We shan\'t meet you there. And how can we live, never meeting you?\\" \\"But you shall meet me, dear one,\\" said Aslan. \\"Are -are you there too, Sir?\\" said Edmund. \\"I am,\\" said Aslan. \\"But there I have another name. You must learn to know me by that name. This was the very reason why you were brought to Narnia, that by knowing me here for a little, you may know me better there.","Things never happen the same way twice.","The more we get what we now call \'ourselves\' out of the way and let Him take us over, the more truly ourselves we become.","This act [creation], as it is for God, must always remain totally inconceivable to man. For we--even our poets and musicians and inventors--never, in the ultimate sense make. We only build. We always have materials to build from. All we can know about the act of creation must be derived from what we can gather about the relation of the creatures to their Creator","Don\'t say it was delightful; make us say delightful when we\'ve read the description. You see, all those words (horrifying, wonderful, hideous, exquisite) are only like saying to your readers Please will you do the job for me.","Do not cite the Deep Magic to me, Witch. I was there when it was written.","True friends... face in the same direction, toward common projects, interests, goals.","When first things are put first, second things are not suppressed but increased.","If you picture Time as a straight line along which we have to travel, then you must think of God as the whole page on which the line is drawn.","There is only one way fit for a man - Heroism, or Master-Morality, or Violence. All the other people in between are ploughing the sand.","What we want is not more little books about Christianity, but more little books by Christians on other subjects--with their Christianity latent.","It is better to forget about yourself altogether.","To admire Satan [in Paradise Lost] is to give one\'s vote not only for a world of misery, but also for a world of lies and propaganda, of wishful thinking, of incessant autobiography.","The moment good taste knows itself, some of its goodness is lost.","The Christians are right: it is Pride which has been the chief cause of misery in every nation and every family since the world began.","The heart of Christianity is a myth which is also a fact. The old myth of the Dying God, without ceasing to be myth, comes down from the heaven of legend and imagination to the earth of history. It happens - at a particular date, in a particular place, followed by definable historical consequences. We pass from a Balder or an Osiris, dying nobody knows when or where, to a historical Person crucified (it is all in order) under Pontius Pilate. By becoming fact it does not cease to be myth: that is the miracle.","Try to exclude the possibility of suffering which the order of nature and the existence of free-wills involve, and you find that you have excluded life itself","The Moral Law tells us the tune we have to play: our instincts are merely the keys.","There seems to be hardly any one among my acquaintance from whom I have not learned.","The good man\'s past begins to change so that his forgiven sins and remembered sorrows take on the quality of Heaven.","Inner silence is for our race a difficult achievement. There is a chattering part of the mind which continues, until it is corrected, to chatter on even in the holiest places.","This is one of the miracles of love: It gives a power of seeing through its own enchantments and yet not being disenchanted.","Lucy woke out of the deepest sleep you can imagine, with the feeling that the voice she liked best in the world had been calling her name.","A man is never so proud as when striking an attitude of humility.","Where, except in the present, can the eternal be met?","This world is a great sculptor\'s shop. We are the statues and there is a rumor going round the shop that some of us are some day going to come to life.","You can\'t know, you can only believe - or not.","Any amount of theology can now be smuggled into people\'s minds under the cover of fiction without their knowing it.","Adventures are never fun while you\'re having them.","Perhaps your own reiterated cries deafen you to the voice you hoped to hear","Our experience is coloured through and through by books and plays and the cinema, and it takes patience and skill to disentangle the things we have really learned from life for ourselves.","Falling in love is something that happens to us, being is love is something we do. No passion is self preservatory.","If you asked twenty good men to-day what they thought the highest of the virtues, nineteen of them would reply, Unselfishness. But if you asked almost any of the great Christians of old he would have replied, Love - You see what has happened? A negative term has been substituted for a positive, and this is of more than philological importance. The negative ideal of Unselfishness carries with it the suggestion not primarily of securing good things for others, but of going without them ourselves, as if our abstinence and not their happiness was the important point.","The true reader reads every work seriously in the sense that he reads it whole-heartedly, makes himself as receptive as he can. But for that very reason he cannot possibly read every work solemly or gravely. For he will read \'in the same spirit that the author writ.\'... He will never commit the error of trying to munch whipped cream as if it were venison.","Friendship, then, like the other natural loves, is unable to save itself. In reality, because it is spiritual and therefore faces a subtler enemy, it must, even more wholeheartedly than they, invoke the divine protection if it hopes to remain sweet. For consider how narrow its true path is. Is must not become what the people call a \\"mutual admiration society\\"; yet if it is not full of mutual admiration, of Appreciative love, it is not Friendship at all.","Once a king or queen of Narnia, always a king or queen of Narnia.","Talk to me about the truth of religion and I\'ll listen gladly. Talk to me about the duty of religion and I\'ll listen submissively. But don\'t come talking to me about the consolations of religion or I shall suspect that you don\'t understand.","When you have reached your own room, be kind to those Who have chosen different doors and to those who are still in the hall.","I am in love and out of it I will not go.","The very lack of evidence is thus treated as evidence; the absence of smoke proves that the fire is very carefully hidden...A belief in invisible cats cannot be logically disproved although it does tell us a good deal about those who hold it.","Where, except in uncreated light, can the darkness be drowned?","For in self-giving, if anywhere, we touch a rhythm not only of all creation but of all being.","Sainthood lies in the habit of referring the smallest actions to God.","There is a difficulty about disagreeing with God. He is the source from which all your reasoning power comes: you could not be right and he wrong any more than a stream can rise higher than its own source. When you are arguing against Him you are arguing against the very power that makes you able to argue at all: it is like cutting off the branch you are sitting on.","You can\u2019t get second things by putting them first. You get second things only by putting first things first.","I am a product [...of] endless books.","The term is over: the holidays have begun. The dream is ended: this is the morning.","If we accept Heaven we shall not be able to retain even the smallest and most intimate souvenirs of Hell.","Human beings judge one another by their external actions. God judges them by their moral choices.","A society in which conjugal infidelity is tolerated must always be in the long run a society adverse to women.","For in grief nothing \'stays put.\' One keeps on emerging from a phase, but it always recurs. Round and round. \\n Everything repeats. Am I going in circles, or dare I hope I am on a spiral?","Ideally, we should like to define a good book as one which \'permits, invites, or compels\' good reading","When golden moments come, when God enables one really to pray without words, who but a fool would reject the gift?","Our problem with desire is that we want too little.","If God is Love, He is, by definition, something more than mere kindness.","It\'s so much easier to pray for a bore than to go and see one.","God is no fonder of intellectual slackers than He is of any other slacker.","If a man thinks he is not conceited, he is very conceited indeed.","The value of myth is that it takes all the things you know and restores to them the rich significance which has been hidden by the veil of familiarity.","Each day we are becoming a creature of splendid glory or one of unthinkable horror.","All shall be done, but it may be harder than you think.","As Venus within Eros does not really aim at pleasure, so Eros does not aim at happiness. We may think he does, but when he is brought to the test it proves otherwise... For it is the very mark of Eros that when he is in us we had rather share unhappiness with the Beloved than be happy on any other terms.","A moderated religion is as good for us as no religion at all\u2014and more amusing.","Really great moral teachers never do introduce new moralities: it is quacks and cranks who do that.","When humans should have become as perfect in voluntary obedience as the inanimate creation is in its lifeless obedience, then they will put on its glory, or rather that greater glory of which Nature is only the first sketch.","Naturally, since I myself am a writer, I do not wish the ordinary reader to read no modern books. But if he must read only the new or only the old, I would advise him to read the old.","A concentrated mind and a sitting body make for better prayer than a kneeling body and a mind half asleep.","Everyone feels benevolent if nothing happens to be annoying him at the moment.","No man can be an exile if he remembers that all the world is one city.","You have a traitor there, Aslan,\\" said the Witch. Of course everyone present knew that she meant Edmund. But Edmund had got past thinking about himself after all he\'d been through and after the talk he\'d had that morning. He just went on looking at Aslan. It didn\'t seem to matter what the Witch said.","Look for the valleys, the green places, and fly through them. There will always be a way through.","I was at this time living, like so many Atheists or Antitheists, in a whirl of contradictions. I maintained that God did not exist. I was also very angry with God for not existing. I was equally angry with Him for creating a world.","From the moment a creature becomes aware of God as God and of itself as self, the terrible alternative of choosing God or self for the centre is opened to it.","It is good that the window should be transparent, because the street or garden beyond it is opaque. How if you saw through the garden too? It is no use trying to \'see through\' [everything]. If you see through everything, then everything is transparent. But a wholly transparent world is an invisible world. To \'see through\' all things is the same as not to see.","Peter did not feel very brave; indeed, he felt he was going to be sick. But that made no difference to what he had to do.","The unhistorical are usually, without knowing it, enslaved to a fairly recent past.","Humanity does not pass through phases as a train passes through stations: being alive, it has the privilege of always moving yet never leaving anything behind. Whatever we have been, in some sort we are still.","The universe rings true whenever you fairly test it.","When you give up a bit of work don\'t (unless it is hopelessly bad) throw it away. Put it in a drawer. It may come in useful later. Much of my best work, or what I think my best, is the re-writing of things begun and abandoned years earlier.","We who have been true readers all our life fully realize the enormous of our being which we owe to authors.","You can\'t really study people; you can only get to know them.","The road to the promised land runs past Sinai.","This is the land of Narnia,\' said the Faun, \'where we are now; all that lies between the lamp-post and the great castle of Cair Paravel on the eastern sea.","All the time the joke is that the word \\"mine\\" in its fully possessive sense cannot be uttered by a human being about anything. In the long run either [Satan] or God will say \\"mine\\" of each thing that exists, and specially of each man.","A man may have to die for our country: but no man must, in any exclusive sense, live for his country. He who surrenders himself without reservation to the temporal claims of a nation, or a party, or a class is rendering to Caesar that which, of all things, most emphatically belongs to God: himself.","Hitherto the plans of the educationalists have achieved very little of what they attempted, and indeed we may well thank the beneficent obstinacy of real mothers, real nurses, and (above all) real children for preserving the human race in such sanity as it still possesses.","The terrible thing, the almost impossible thing, is to hand over your whole self--all your wishes and precautions--to Christ. But it is far easier than what we are all trying to do instead. For what we are trying to do is to remain what we call \\"ourselves,\\" to keep personal happiness as our great aim in life, and yet at the same time be \\"good.","To live in a fully predictable world is not to be a man.","I am perfectly convinced that whatever the gospels are they are not legends. I have read a great deal of legend and I am quite clear they are not that sort of thing....Christ bent down and scribbled in the dust with His finger. Nothing comes of this. No one has based any doctrine on it. And the act of inventing little irrelevant details to make an imaginary scene more convincing is purely a modern art.","The poison was brewed in these West lands but it has spat itself everywhere by now. However far you went you would find the machines, the crowded cities, the empty thrones, the false writings, the barren beds:  men maddened with false promises and soured with true miseries, worshipping the iron works of their own hands, cut off from Earth their Mother and from the Father in Heaven. You might go East so far the East became West and you returned to Britain across the great Ocean, but even so you would not have come out anywhere into the light.  The shadow of one dark wing is over all Tellus.","The fact that you are giving money to charity does not mean that you need\\nnot try to find out whether that charity is a fraud or not.","For most of us the prayer in Gethsemane is the only model. Removing mountains can wait.","There ought to be things we should like to do and cannot do because our charitable expenditures excludes them.","Literature adds to reality, it does not simply describe it. It enriches the necessary competencies that daily life requires and provides; and in this respect, it irrigates the deserts that our lives have already become.","The human heart is not unchanging (nay, changes almost out of recognition in the twinkling of an eye).","The Christian idea of \'putting on Christ\' is the whole of Christianity.","If you had felt yourself sufficient, it would have been a proof that you were not.","Many a man, brought up in the glib profession of some shallow form of Christianity, who comes through reading Astronomy to realize for the first time how majestically indifferent most reality is to man, and who perhaps abandons his religion on that account, may at that moment be having his first genuinely religious experience.","It is funny how mortals always picture us as putting things into their minds: in reality our best work is done by keeping things out.","Love is not affectionate feeling, but a steady wish for the loved person\'s ultimate good as far as it can be obtained.","We are forbidden to neglect the assembling of ourselves together. Christianity is already institutional in the earliest of its documents. The Church is the Bride of Christ. We are members of one another.","I write for the unlearned about things in which I am unlearned myself.","But the most obvious fact about praise \u2014 whether of God or anything \u2014 strangely escaped me. I thought of it in terms of compliment, approval, or the giving of honor. I had never noticed that all enjoyment spontaneously overflows into praise unless (sometimes even if) shyness or the fear of boring others is deliberately brought in to check it.","if you do one good deed your reward usually is to be set to do another and harder and better one.","What draws people to be friends is that they see the same truth. They share it.","For you will certainly carry out God\'s purpose, however you act, but it makes a difference to you whether you serve like Judas or like John.","Reality the iconoclast once more. Heaven will solve our problems, but not, I think, by showing us subtle reconciliations between all our apparently contradictory notions. The notions will all be knocked from under our feet. We shall see that there never was any problem.","Christ did not die for man because they were intrinsically worth dying for, but because he is intrinsically love, and therefore loves infinitely.","The only thing one can usually change in one\'s situation is oneself. And yet one can\'t change that either-only ask Our Lord to do so.","In the science, Evolution is a theory about changes; in the myth it is a fact about improvements.","And all the time - such is the tragic comedy of our situation - we continue to clamor for those very qualities we are rendering impossible. We make men without chests and expect of them virtue and enterprise. We laugh at honor and are shocked to find traitors in our midst. We castrate and bid the geldings be fruitful.","Those who would most scornfully repudiate Christianity as a mere \\"opiate of the people\\" have a contempt for the rich, that is, for all mankind except the poor.","God\'s love is not wearied by our sins & is relentless in its determination that we be cured at whatever cost to us or Him","Let me make it quite clear that when Christians say the Christ-life is in them, they do not mean simply something mental or moral. When they speak of being \\"in Christ\\" or of Christ being \\"in them\\", this is not simply a way of saying that they are thinking about Christ or copying Him. They mean that Christ is actually operating through them; that the whole mass of Christians are the physical organism through which Christ acts--that we are His fingers and muscles, the cells of His body.","We are afraid that Heaven is a bribe, and that if we make it our goal we shall no longer be disinterested. It is not so. Heaven offers nothing that the mercenary soul can desire. It is safe to tell the pure in heart that they shall see God, for only the pure in heart want to. There are rewards that do not sully motives. A man\'s love for a woman is not mercenary because he wants to marry her, nor his love for poetry mercenary because he wants to read it, nor his love of exercise less disinterested because he wants to run and leap and walk. Love, by definition, seeks to enjoy its object.","I prefer being honest to being \'honest to God.\'","A woman means by Unselfishness chiefly taking trouble for others; a man means not giving trouble to others...thus, while the woman thinks of doing good offices and the man of respecting other people\'s rights, each sex, without any obvious unreason, can and does regard the other as radically selfish.","To what will you look for help if you will not look to that which is stronger than yourself?","In a civilization like ours, I feel that everyone has to come to terms with the claims of Jesus Christ upon his life, or else be guilty of inattention or of evading the question.","There might be things more terrible even than losing someone you love by death.","If war is ever lawful, then peace is sometimes sinful.","Atheism turns out to be too simple. If the whole universe has no meaning, we should never have found out that it has no meaning.","That will not be the time for choosing: it will be the time when we discover which side we really have chosen, whether we realized it before or not. Now, today, this moment, is out chance to chose the right side. God is holding back to give us that chance. It will not last forever. We must take it or leave it.","Aslan: You doubt your value. Don\'t run from who you are.","The essence of religion, in my view, is the thirst for an end higher than natural ends.","Good and evil increase at compound interest. That\'s why the little decisions we make every day are of infinite importance.","There is no doctrine which I would more willingly remove from Christianity than the doctrine of hell, if it lay in my power. But it has the support of Scripture and, especially, of our Lord\'s own words; it has always been held by the Christian Church, and it has the support of reason.","Child, to say the very thing you really mean, the whole of it, nothing more or less or other than what you really mean; that\'s the whole art and joy of words.","He has room for people with very little sense, but He wants everyone to use what sense they have.","I wrote this story for you, but when I began it I had not realized that girls grow quicker than books. As a result you are already too old for fairy tales, and by the time it is printed and bound you will be older still. But some day you will be old enough to start reading fairy tales again. You can then take it down from some upper shelf, dust it, and tell me what you think of it. I shall probably be too deaf to hear, and too old to understand a word you say, but I shall still be your affectionate Godfather, C. S. Lewis.","Now we cannot...discover our failure to keep God\'s law except by trying our very hardest (and then failing). Unless we really try, whatever we say there will always be at the back of our minds the idea that if we try harder next time we shall succeed in being completely good. Thus, in one sense, the road back to God is a road of moral effort, of trying harder and harder. But in another sense it is not trying that is ever going tobring us home. All this trying leads up to the vital moment at which you turn to God and say, \\"You must do this. I can\'t.","Why love if losing hurts so much? We love to know that we are not alone.","All joy... emphasizes our pilgrim status; always reminds, beckons, awakens desire. Our best havings are wantings.","Those of us who are blamed when old for reading childish books were blamed when children for reading books too old for us.","The best swordsman in the world may be disarmed by a trick that\'s new to him.","It is in their \'good\' characters that novelists make, unawares, the most shocking self- revelations.","As the king governs by his executive, so Reason in man must rule the mere appetites by means of the \'spirited element.\'","Don\'t say it was \\"delightful\\"; make us say \\"delightful\\" when we\'ve read the description.","Spying on people by magic is the same as spying on them in any other way.","Youth and age touch only the surface of our lives.","As image and apprehension are in organic unity, so, for a Christian, are human body and human soul.","Sexual appetite, like any other appetite, grows by indulgence","The people with very hard problems are understood by God. He knows what wretched machines they are trying to drive. Some day he will fling them away and give those people new ones; then they may astonish everyone, for they learned their driving in a hard school. Some of the last will be first and some of the first will be last.","It is natural for us to wish that God had designed for us a less glorious and less arduous destiny; but then we are wishing not for more love but for less.","The only thing Christianity can not be...is moderately important.","Really, a young Atheist cannot guard his faith too carefully. Dangers lie in wait for him on every side.","The notion that everyone would like Christianity to be true, and therefore all atheists are brave men who have accepted the defeat of all their deepest desires, is simply impudent nonsense.","Well,\' said Ransom, \'if it is a delusion, it\'s a pretty stubborn one.","The higher the stakes, the greater the temptation to lose your temper.","The New Testament does not envisage solitary religion; regular assembly for worship is everywhere in the epistles.","As a Christian I take it for granted that human history will some day end; and I am offering Omniscience no advice as to the best date for that consummation.","The first fact in the history of Christendom is a number of people who say they have seen the Resurrection.","I have been suspected of being what is called a Fundamentalist. That is because I never regard any narrative as unhistorical simply on the ground that it includes the miraculous.","In God\'s dimension, so to speak, you find a being who is three Persons while remaining one Being, just as a cube is six squares while remaining one cube.","Onward and Upward! To Narnia and the North!","In God you come up against something which is in every respect immeasurably superior to yourself. Unless you know God as that-and, therefore, know yourself as nothing in comparison-you do not know God at all.","Chastity is the most unpopular of the Christian virtues. There is no getting away from it; the old Christian rule is, \\"Either marriage, with completely faithfulness to your partner, or else total abstinence.\\"","Daughter, I have now lived a hundred and nine winters in this world and have never yet met any such thing as Luck. There is something about all this that I do not understand: but if ever we need to know it, you may be sure that we shall.","We need not despair even in our worst, for our failures are forgiven. The only fatal thing is to sit down content with anything less than perfection.","I am a product [...of] endless books. My father bought all the books he read and never got rid of any of them.... I had always the same certainty of finding a book that was new to me as a man who walks into a field has of finding a new blade of grass.","To the Ancients, Friendship seemed the happiest and most fully human of all loves... The modern world in comparison, ignores it.","Isn\'t it funny the way some combinations of words can give you--almost apart from their meaning--a thrill like music?","One of the reasons why it needs no special education to be a Christian is that Christianity is an education itself.","Christianity is not a patent medicine. Christianity claims to give an account of facts - to tell you what the real universe is like. Its account of the universe may be true, or it may not, and once the question is really before you, then your natural inquisitiveness must make you want to know the answer. If Christianity is untrue, then no honest man will want to believe it, however helpful it might be: if it is true, every honest man will want to believe it, even if it gives him no help at all.","I think it very wrong to pray for people while they are in distress and then not to continue praying, now with thanksgiving, when they are relieved.","The human mind has no more power of inventing a new value than of planting a new sun in the sky or a new primary color in the spectrum.","Eros will have naked bodies; Friendship naked personalities.","To please God\u2026 to be a real ingredient in the divine happiness\u2026 to be loved by God, not merely pitied, but delighted in as an artist delights in his work or a father in a son- it seems impossible, a weight or burden of glory which our thoughts can hardly sustain. But so it is.","In your life you meet people. Some you never think about again. Some, you wonder what happened to them. There are some that you wonder if they ever think about you. And then there are some that you wish you never have to think about again. But you do.","A promise must be about actions: no one can promise to go on feeling a certain way.","I think earth, if chosen instead of Heaven, will turn out to have been, all along, only a region in Hell; and earth, if put second to Heaven, to have been from the beginning a part of Heaven itself.","The true Christian\'s nostril is to be continually attentive to the inner cesspool.","There is someone I accept even though I do not approve of all he does...and that someone is me","The naturalists have been engaged in thinking about Nature. They have not attended to the fact that they were thinking. The moment one attends to this it is obvious that one\'s own thinking cannot be merely a natural event, and that therefore something other than nature exists. The Supernatural is not remote or abstruse; it is a matter of daily and hourly experience, as intimate as breathing.","The discomfiture we feel may be our most accurate human sensation; reminding us we are not quite \\"at home\\" here.","Into the void of silence, into the empty space of nothing, the joy of life is unfurled.","Sanity ... had it ever been more than a convention -- a comfortable set of blinkers, an agreed mode of wishful thinking, which excluded from our view the full strangeness and malevolence of the universe we are compelled to inhabit?","As St. Paul points out, Christ never meant that we were to remain children in intelligence: on the contrary, He told us to be not only \\"as harmless as doves,\\" but also \\"as wise as serpents.\\" He wants a child\'s heart, but a grown-up\'s head.","No good work is done anywhere without aid from the Father of Lights.","Language exists to communicate whatever it can communicate. Some things it communicates so badly that we never attempt to communicate them by words if any other medium is available.","He cannot \\"tempt\\" to virtue as we do to vice. He wants them to learn to walk and must therefore take away His hand; and if only the will to walk is really there He is pleased even with their stumbles.","The process of growing up is to be valued for what we gain, not for what we lose.","And she never could remember; and ever since that day what Lucy means by a good story is a story which reminds her of the forgotten story in the Magician\'s Book.","The man can neither man, nor retain, one moment of time; it all comes to him by pure gift; he might as well regard the sun and moon as his chattels.","We were talking of DRAGONS, Tolkien and I In a Berkshire bar. The big workman Who had sat silent and sucked his pipe All the evening, from his empty mug With gleaming eye glanced towards us: \\"I seen \'em myself!\\" he said fiercely.","For the Present is the point at which time touches eternity.","You can\u2019t go on \u201cseeing through\u201d things forever. The whole point of seeing through something is to see something through it. To \u201csee through\u201d all things is the same as not to see.","And that is enough to raise your thoughts to what may happen when the redeemed soul, beyond all hope and nearly beyond belief, learns at last that she has pleased Him whom she was created to please. There will be no room for vanity then. She will be free from the miserable illusion that it is her doing. With no taint of what we should now call self-approval she will most innocently rejoice in the thing that God has made her to be, and the moment which heals her old inferiority complex forever will also drown her pride\u2026 Perfect humility dispenses with modesty.","Here at last is the thing I was made for.","In reading Chesterton, as in reading MacDonald, I did not know what I was letting myself in for. A young man who wishes to remain a sound Atheist cannot be too careful of his reading. There are traps everywhere \u2014 \\"Bibles laid open, millions of surprises,\\" as Herbert says, \\"fine nets and stratagems.\\" God is, if I may say it, very unscrupulous.","I know the two great commandments, and I\'d better get on with them.","but who can feel ugly, when their heart feels joy","What you want is practice, practice, practice. It doesn\u2019t matter what we write (at least this is my view) at our age, so long as we write continually as well as we can. I feel that every time I write a page either of prose or of verse, with real effort, even if it\u2019s thrown into the fire the next minute, I am so much further on.","He (God) loved us not because we are lovable, but because He is love.","We who defend Christianity find ourselves constantly opposed not by the irreligion of our headers but by their real religion.","Away with tears and fears and troubles! United in wedlock with the eternal Godhead Itself, our nature ascends into the Heaven of Heavens. So it would be impious to call ourselves \'miserable.\' On the contrary, Man is a creature whom the Angels-were they capable of envy-would envy. Let us lift up our hearts!","The Christian has a great advantage over other men, not by being less fallen than they, nor less doomed to live in a fallen world, but by knowing that he is a fallen man in a fallen world.","God, who needs nothing, loves into existence wholly superfluous creatures in order that he may love and perfect them.","Creatures are not born with desires unless satisfaction for those desires exists. A baby feels hunger: well, there is such a thing as food. A duckling wants to swim: well, there is such a thing as water...If I find in myself a desire, which no experience in this world can satisfy, the most probable explanation is that I was made for another world.","You find out more about God from the Moral Law than from the univerise in general just as you find out more about a man by listening to his conversation than by looking at a house he has built.","The gap between those who worship different gods is not so wide as the gap between those who worship and those who don\'t.","When we see the face of God we shall know that we have always known it. He has been a party to, has made, sustained and moved moment by moment within, all our earthly experiences of innocent love.","All the delights of sense, or heart, or intellect, with which you could once have tempted him, even the delights of virtue itself, now seem to him in comparison but as the half nauseous attractions of a raddled harlot would seem to a man who hears that his true beloved whom he has loved all his life and whom he had believed to be dead is alive and even now at his door.","The next moment is as much beyond our grasp, and as much in God\'s care, as that a hundred years away. Care for the next minute is as foolish as care for a day in the next thousand years. In neither can we do anything, in both God is doing everything.","The only people who hate escapism are jailers.","The fundamental laws are in the long run merely statements that every event is itself and not some different event.","Dance and game are frivolous, unimportant down here; for \\"down here\\" is not their natural place. Here, they are a moment\'s rest from the life we were placed here to live. But in this world everything is upside down. That which, if it could be prolonged here, would be a truancy, is likest that which in a better country is the End of ends. Joy is the serious business of Heaven.","We are not the playwright, we are not the producer, we are not even the audience. We are on the stage.","Remember He is the artist and you are the picture. You can\u2019t see it, you can\'t see your true self. So quietly submit to be painted.","Pleasure that is its own pursuit is always bad pleasure.","All get what they want; they do not always like it.","If God is satisfied with the work, the work may be satisfied with itself.","We have to be continually reminded of what we believe.","Hope is one of the Theological virtues. This means that a continual looking forward to the eternal world is not (as some modern people think) a form of escapism or wishful thinking, but one of the things a Christian is meant to do. It does not mean that we are to leave the present world as it is. If you read history you will find that the Christians who did most for the present world were just those who thought most of the next.","Reality is harsh to the feet of shadows. But will you come?","We may give our human loves the unconditional allegiance which we owe only to God. They they become gods: then they become demons. Then they will destroy us, and also destroy themselves. For natural loves that are allowed to become gods do not remain loves. They are still called so, but can become in fact complicated forms of hatred.","The world was made partly that there may be prayer; partly that our prayers might be answered.","Nothing is more likely to destroy a species or a nation than a determination to survive at all costs","The promise, made when I am in love, to be true to the beloved as long as I live, commits me to being true even if I cease to be in love.","Very often what God first helps us towards is not the virtue itself but just this power of always trying again.","It is only our bad temper that we put down to being tired or worried or hungry; we put our good temper down to ourselves.","The surest way of spoiling a pleasure [is] to start examining your satisfaction.","The terrible thing, the almost impossible thing, is the hand over your whole self--all your wishes and precautions--to Christ.","For prayer is request. The essence of request, as distinct from compulsion, is that it may or may not be granted.","I#pray because the need flows out of me all the time-walking and sleeping. It does not change  #\u200e God  - it changes me.","Critics who treat adult as a term of approval, instead of as a merely descriptive term, cannot be adult themselves. To be concerned about being grown up, to admire the grown up because it is grown up, to blush at the suspicion of being childish; these things are the marks of childhood and adolescence.","Liking an author may be as involuntary and improbable as falling in love.","The only palliative is to keep the clean sea breeze of the centuries blowing through our minds, and this can be done only by reading old books.","But one of the worst results of being a slave and being forced to do things is that when there is no one to force you any more you find you have almost lost the power of forcing yourself.","It certainly is my opinion that a book worth reading only in childhood is not worth reading even then.","In those days a boy on the classical side officially did almost nothing but classics. I think this was wise; the greatest service we can to education today is to teach few subjects. No one has time to do more than a very few things well before he is twenty, and when we force a boy to be a mediocrity in a dozen subjects we destroy his standards, perhaps for life.","Surely what a man does when he is taken off his guard is the best evidence for what sort of man he is.","If tribulation is a necessary element in redemption, we must anticipate that it will never cease till God sees the world to be either redeemed or no further redeemable.","when pain is to be born, a little courage helps more than much knowledge, a little human sympathy more than much courage, and the least tincture of the love of God more than all.","Every natural love will rise again and live forever in this country: but none will rise again until it has been buried.","The castle of Cair Paravel on its little hill towered up above them; before them were the sands, with rocks and little pools of salt water, and seaweed, and the smell of the sea and long miles of bluish-green waves breaking for ever and ever on the beach. And oh, the cry of the seagulls! Have you ever heard it? Can you remember?","\\"I wish I had never been born,\\" she said. \\n\\"What are we born for?\\" \\n\\"For infinite happiness,\\" said the Spirit. \\n\\"You can step out into it at any moment...\\"","The present is the only time in which any duty may be done or grace received.","The full acting out of the self\'s surrender to God therefore demands pain: this action, to be perfect, must be done from the pure will to obey, in the absence, or in the teeth, of inclination","I never see why we should do anything unless it is either a duty or a pleasure! Life\'s short enough without filling up hours unnecessarily","Education is only the most fully conscious of the channels whereby each generation influences the next.","On the whole, God\u2019s love for us is a much safer subject to think about than our love for Him. Nobody can always have devout feelings: and even if we could, feelings are not what God principally cares about. Christian Love, either towards God or towards man, is an affair of the will.","People who bore one another should meet seldom; people who interest one another, often.","The long, dull, monotonous years of middle-aged prosperity or middle-aged adversity are excellent campaigning weather for the devil.","What we call Man\'s power over Nature turns out to be a power exercised by some men over other men with Nature as its instrument.","Quarrelling means trying to show that the other man is in the wrong. (And) There is no sense in trying to do that unless you and he had some sort of agreement as to what Righ and Wrong are.","Thirty was so strange for me. I\'ve really had to come to terms with the fact that I am now a walking and talking adult.","I may repeat \'Do as you would be done by\' till I am black in the face, but I cannot really carry it out till I love my neighbor as myself: and I cannot learn to love my neighbor as myself till I learn to love God;and I cannot learn to love God except by learning to obey him.","If you simply try to tell the truth you will, nine times out of ten, be original without ever having noticed it.","Since I am I, I must make an act of self-surrender, however small or however easy, in living to God rather than to my self.","I desired dragons with a profound desire.","The old field of space, time, matter, and the senses is to be weeded, dug, and sown for a new crop. We may be tired of that old field: God is not.","If God thinks this state of war in the universe is a price worth paying for free will--that is, for making a live world in which creatures can do real good or harm and something of real importance of real importance can happen, instead of a toy world which only moves when He pulls the strings--then we may take it it is worth paying.","We have a strange illusion that mere time cancels sin.","Surely you know that if a man can\'t be cured of churchgoing, the next best thing is to send him all over the neighbourhood looking for the church that \\"suits\\" him until he becomes a taster or connoisseur of churches.","You must have a capacity to receive, or even omnipotence can\'t give.","Knock and it shall be opened.\' But does knocking mean hammering and kicking the door like a maniac?","It is always the novice who exaggerates.","Emeth speaking of Aslan, \\"Beloved, said the Glorious One, unless thy desire had been for me thou wouldst not have sought so long and so truly. For all find what they truly seek...And since then, O Kings and Ladies, I have been wandering to find him and my happiness is so great that it even weakens me like a wound. And this is the marvel of marvels, that he called me Beloved, me who am but as a dog","The task of the modern educator is not to cut down jungles but to irrigate deserts. The right defence against false sentiments is to inculcate just sentiments. By starving the sensibility of our pupils we only make them easier prey to the propagandist when he comes. For famished nature will be avenged and a hard heart is no infallible protection against a soft head.","An almost perfect relationship with his father was the earthly root of all his wisdom. From his own father, he said, he first learned that Fatherhood must be at the core of the universe. [speaking of George MacDonald]","I sometimes wonder whether all pleasures are not substitutes for joy.","I wonder if people who asked for God to intervene in our world, really know what they are asking. Will they want to be there when God really does intervene?","The human mind is generally far more eager to praise or dispraise than it is to describe and define.","Authority exercised with humility, and obedience accepted with delight are the very lines along which our spirits live.","Most of us, I suppose, have a secret country but for most of us it is only an imaginary country. Edmund and Lucy were luckier than other people in that respect.","And he writhed inside at what seemed the cruelty and unfairness of the demand. He had not yet learned that if you do one good deed your reward usually is to do another and harder and better one.","100 per cent of us die, and the percentage cannot be increased.","Come, live with me and you\'ll know me.","I do not expect old heads on young shoulders.","It is very true. But even a traitor may mend. I have known one that did.","A thing may be morally neutral and yet the desire for that thing may be dangerous.","Dearest Daughter. I knew you would not be long in coming to me. Joy shall be yours.","People shouldn\'t call for demons unless they really mean what they say.","The laws of thought are also the laws of things: of things in the remotest space and the remotest time.","Man must endure his going hence.","How little people know who think that holiness is dull... When one meets the real thing, it\'s irresistible!","Anger is the fluid love bleeds when cut.","Heaven offers nothing that a mercenary soul can desire.","The Intelligentsia (scientists apart) are losing all touch with, and all influence over, nearly the whole human race. Our most esteemed poets and critics are read by our most esteemed critics and poets (who don\'t usually like them much) and nobody else takes any notice. An increasing number of highly literate people simply ignore what the \'Highbrows\' are doing. It says nothing to them. The Highbrows in return ignore and insult them.","Giving to the poor is an essential part of Christian morality.","The absent are easily refuted.","All killing is not murder any more than all sexual intercourse is adultery.","Ink is the great cure for all human ills.","Earthly pleasures were never meant to satisfy.","Why must holy places be dark places?","What I like about experience is that it is such an honest thing. You may take any number of wrong turnings; but keep your eyes open and you will not be allowed to go very far before the warning signs appear. You may have deceived yourself, but experience is not trying to deceive you. The universe rings true wherever you fairly test it.","What the soul cries out for is the resurrection of the senses. Even in this life, matter would be nothing to us if it were not the source of sensations.","Of course all children\'s literature is not fantastic, so all fantastic books need not be children\'s books. It is still possible, even in an age so ferociously anti-romantic as our own, to write fantastic stories for adults: though you will usually need to have made a name in some more fashionable kind of literature before anyone will publish them.","An unliterary man may be defined as one who reads books once only.","Wisdom: The first error is that of the southern people, and it consists in holding that these eastern and western places are real places. Give no quarter to that thought, whether it threatens you with fear, or tempts you with hopes. For this is Superstition and all who believe it will come in the end to the swamps, to the south and the jungles, to the far south. Part of the same error is to think that the Landlord is a real man.","...if all we mean by our love is a craving to be loved, we are in a very deplorable state.","Telling us to obey instinct is like telling us to obey \'people.\' People say different things: so do instincts. Our instincts are at war... Each instinct, if you listen to it, will claim to be gratified at the expense of the rest.","To love at all is to be vulnerable. Love anything and your heart will be wrung.","You can\'t just go on being a good egg. You must either hatch or go bad!","The right direction leads not only to peace but to knowledge.","We must get over wanting to be needed.","Prosperity knits a man to the world.","If the immutable heart can be grieved by the puppets of its own making, it is Divine Omnipotence, no other, that has subjected it, freely, and in a humility that passes understanding. If the world exists not chiefly that we may love God, but that God may love us, yet that very fact, on a deeper level, is so for our sakes. If He who in Himself can lack nothing chooses to need us, it is because we need to be needed.","I wish they would remember that the charge to Peter was \\"Feed my sheep\\", not \\"Try experiments on my rats\\", or even \\"Teach my performing dogs new tricks\\".","Joy is never in our power and pleasure often is","Well!\' said Puddleglum, rubbing his hands. \'This is just what I needed. If these chaps don\'t teach me to take a serious view of life, I don\'t know what will.","We have made men proud of most vices, but not of cowardice. Whenever we have almost succeeded in doing so, God permits a war or an earthquake or some other calamity, and at once courage becomes so obviously lovely and important even in human eyes that all our work is undone, and there is still at least one vice of which they feel genuine shame. The danger of inducing cowardice in our patients, therefore, is lest we produce real self-knowledge and self-loathing, with consequent repentance and humility.","What assurance have we that our masters will or can keep the promise which induced us to sell ourselves? Let us not be deceived by phrases about \'Man taking charge of his own destiny\'. All that can really happen is that some men will take charge of the destiny of the others. They will be simply men; none perfect; some greedy, cruel and dishonest. The more completely we are planned the more powerful they will be. Have we discovered some new reason why, this time, power should not corrupt as it has done before?","Those who are enjoying something, or suffering something, together, are companions. Those who enjoy or suffer one another, are not.","Child, that is why all the rest are now a horror to her. That is what happens to those who pluck and eat fruits at the wrong time and in the wrong way. Oh, the fruit is good, but they loath it ever after.","No man who values originality will ever be original. But try to tell the truth as you see it, try to do any bit of work as well as it can be done for the work\'s sake, and what men call originality will come unsought.","The Christian and the Materialist hold different beliefs about the universe.  They can\'t both be right. The one who is wrong will act in a way which simply doesn\'t fit the real universe. Consequently, with the best will in the world, he  will be helping his fellow creatures to their destruction.","Are not lifelong friendships born at the moment when at last you meet another human being who has some inkling (but faint and uncertain even in the best) of that something which you were born desiring, and which, beneath the flux of other desires and in all the momentary silences between the louder passions, night and day, year by year, from childhood to old age, you are looking for, watching for, listening for? You have never had it.","We do not truly see light, we only see slower things lit by it, so that for us light is on the edge-the last thing we know before things become too swift for us.","If you think you are not conceited, it means you are very conceited indeed.","But now I discovered the wonderful power of wine. I understood why men become drunkards. For the way it worked on me was not at all that it blotted out these sorrows, but that it made them seem glorious and noble, like sad music, and I somehow great and revered for feeling them.","..(T)here are two opposite reasons for being a democrat. You may think all men so good that they deserve a share in the government of the commonwealth, and so wise that the commonwealth needs their advice. That is, in my opinion, the false, romantic doctrine of democracy. On the other hand, you may believe fallen men to be so wicked that not one of them can be trusted with any irresponsible power over his fellows.","We have discovered that the scheme of \'outlawing war\' has made war more like an outlaw without making it less frequent and that to banish the knight does not alleviate the suffering of the peasant.","If you do not take the distinction between good and bad very seriously, then it is easy to say that anything you find in this world is a part of God. But, of course, if you think some things really bad, and God really good, then you cannot talk like that. You must believe that God is separate from the world and that some of the things we see in it are contrary to His will.","Those who tread \'adult\' as a term of approval cannot hope to be considered adult themselves. When I became a man I put away childish things, along with the desire to be very grown up.","My own view is that the Churches should frankly recognise that the majority of the British people are not Christians and, therefore, cannot be expected to live Christian lives. There ought to be two distinct kinds of marriage: one governed by the State with rules enforced on all citizens, the other governed by the Church with rules enforced by her on her own members.\\" --about the only statement i agree with in this book","Nothing which is at all times and in every way agreeable to us can have objective reality. It is of the very nature of the real that it should have sharp corners and rough edges, that it should be resistant, should be itself. Dream-furniture is the only kind on which you never stub your toes or bang your knee.","One is given strength to bear what happens to one, but not the 100 and 1 different things that might happen.","If you could see humanity spread out in time, as God sees it, it would look like one single growing thing-rather like a very complicated tree. Every individual would appear connected with every other.","It now seemed to me that all my other guesses had been only self-pleasing dreams spun out of my wishes, but now I was awake.","Perhaps civilization will never be safe until we care for something else more than we care for it. The hypothesis has certain facts to support it. As far as peace (which is one ingredient in our idea of civilization)is concerned, I think many would now agree that a foreign policy dominated by desire for peace is one of the many roads that lead to war.","Don\'t you mind,\\" said Puddleglum. \\"There are no accidents. Our guide is Aslan; and he was there when the giant king caused the letters to be cut, and he knew already all things that would come of them; including this.","If you are worried about the people outside, the most unreasonable thing you can do is remain outside yourself. Christians are Christ\'s body...every addition to that body enables Him to do more. If you want to help those outside you must add your own little cell to the body of Christ who along can help them. Cutting off a man\'s fingers would be a odd way of getting him to do more work.","Alas,\\" said Aslan, shaking his head. \\"It will. Things always work according to their nature. She has won her heart\'s desire; she has unwearying strength and endless days like a goddess. But length of days with an evil heart is only length of misery and already she begins to know it. All get what they want; they do not always like it.","Oh, I can see it happening, age after age, and growing worse the more you reveal your beauty: the son turning his back on the mother and the bride on her groom, stolen away by this everlasting calling, calling, calling of the gods. Taken where we can\'t follow. It would be far better for us if you were foul and ravening. We\'d rather you drank their blood than stole their hearts. We\'d rather they were ours and dead than yours and made immortal.","And in that far distant day when the gods become wholly beautiful, or we at last are shown how beautiful they always were, this will happen more and more. For mortals, as you said, will become more and more jealous. And mother and wife and child and friend will all be in league to keep a soul from being united with the Divine Nature.","Submit to death, death of your ambitions and favorite wishes every day and death of your whole body in the end: submit with every fiber of your being, and you will find eternal life. Keep back nothing. Nothing that you have not given away will be really yours. Nothing in you that has not died will ever be raised from the dead. . . look to Christ and you will find Him, and with Him everything else thrown in.","When once a man is launched on such an adventure as this, he must bid farewell to hopes and fears, otherwise death or deliverance will both come too late to save his honor and his reason. Ho, my beauties!","I never heard weeping like that before or after; not from a child, nor a man wounded in the palm, nor a tortured man, nor a girl dragged off to slavery from a taken city. If you heard the woman you most hate in the world weep so, you would go to comfort her. You would fight your way through fire and spears to reach her. And I knew who wept, and what had been done to her, and who had done it.","The heart of Christianity is a myth which is also a fact. The old myth of the Dying God, without ceasing to be a myth, comes down from the heaven of legend and imagination to the earth of history.","Excess of love, did ye say? There was no excess, there was defect. She loved her son too little, not too much. If she had loved him more there\'d be no difficulty.","I know all about the despair of overcoming chronic temptation. It is not serious, provided self-offended petulance, annoyance at breaking records, impatience, etc., don\'t get the upper hand. No amount of falls will really undo us if we keep picking ourselves up each time...The only fatal thing is to lose one\'s temper and give up.","The proper aim of giving is to put the recipient in a state where he no longer needs our gifts...Thus a heavy task is laid upon Gift-love.  It must work toward its own abdication.  We must aim at making ourselves superfluous.  The hour when we can say \'They need me no longer\' should be our reward.  But the instinct, simply in its own nature, has no power to fulfill this law.","Thus the criminal ceases to be a person, a subject of rights and duties, and becomes merely an object on which society can work. And this is, in principle, how Hitler treated the Jews. They were objects; killed not for ill desert but because, on his theories, they were a disease in society. If society can mend, remake, and unmake men at its pleasure, its pleasure may, of course, be humane or homicidal. The difference is important. But, either way, rulers have become owners.","A man with an obsession is a man who has very little sales resistance.","My own eyes are not enough for me...I will see through the eyes of others. Reality, even seen through the eyes of many is not enough...I will see what others have invented. Even the eyes of all humanity are not enough. I regret that the brutes cannot write books. Very gladly would I learn what face things present to a mouse or a bee. More gladly still would I perceive the olfactory world charged with all the information and emotion it carries for a dog.","In the ancient world individuals have sold themselves as slaves, in order to eat. So in society. Here is a witch-doctor who can save us from the sorcerers - a war-lord who can save us from the barbarians - a Church that can save us from Hell. Give them what they ask, give ourselves to them bound and blindfold, if only they will! Perhaps the terrible bargain will be made again. We cannot blame men for making it. We can hardly wish them not to. Yet we can hardly bear that they should.","As for wrinkles--Pshaw! Why shouldn\'t we have wrinkles? Honorable insignia of long service in this warfare.","The proper motto is not Be good, sweet maid, and let who can be clever, but Be good sweet maid, and don\'t forget that this involves being as clever as you can. God is no fonder of intellectual slackers than any other slackers.","All schools both here and in America should teach far fewer subjects far better.","The very power of [textbook writers] depends on the fact that they are dealing with a boy: a boy who thinks he is \u2018doing\u2019 his \u2018English prep\u2019 and has no notion that ethics, theology, and politics are all at stake. It is not a theory they put into his mind, but an assumption, which ten years hence, its origin forgotten and its presence unconscious, will condition him to take one side in a controversy which he has never recognized as a controversy at all.","You must see that if two things are alike, then it is a further question whether the first is copied from the second, or the second from the first, or both from a third.","There is a story about a schoolboy who was asked what he thought God was like. He replied that, as far as he could make out, God was \'the sort of person who is always snooping around to see if anyone is enjoying himself and then trying to stop it.\'","There is one bit of advice given us by the ancient Greeks, and by the Jews in the Old Testament, and by the great Christian teachers of the Middle Ages, which the modern economic system has completely disobeyed. All these people told us not to lend money at interest; and lending money at interest - what we call investment - is the basis of our whole system.","It still remains true that no justification of virtue will enable a man to be virtuous.","It is a poor thing to strike our colors to God when the ship is going down under us; a poor thing to come to Him as a last resort, to offer up \'our own\' when it is no longer worth keeping. If God were proud He would hardly have us on such terms: but He is not proud, He stoops to conquer, He will have us even though we have shown that we prefer everything else to Him.","The basic proposal of the new education is to be that dunces and idlers must not be made to feel inferior to intelligent and industrious pupils. That would be \'undemocratic.","God lends us a little of His reasoning powers and that is how we think: He puts a little of His love into us and that is how we love one another. When you teach a child writing, you hold its hand while it forms the letters: that is, it forms the letters because you are forming them. We love and reason because God loves and reasons and holds our hand while we do it.","Most of all, perhaps, we need an intimate knowledge of the past. Not that the past has anything magical about it, but we cannot study the future.","If I had really cared as I thought I did about the sorrows of the world I should not have been so overwhelmed when my own sorrow came- I thought I trusted the rope until it mattered to me whether it would bear me, now it matters and I find I didn\'t.","In a sense it (Christianity) creates, rather than solves, the problem of pain, for pain would be no problem unless side by side with our daily experience of this painful world, we had received what we think a good assurance that ultimate reality is righteousness and loving.","It\'s no use telling us that something was \'mysterious\' or \'loathsome\' or \'awe-inspiring\' or \'voluptuous.\' By direct description, by metaphor and simile, by secretly evoking powerful associations, by offering the right stimuli to our nerves (in the right degree and the right order), and by the very beat and vowel-melody and length and brevity of your sentences, you must bring it about that we, we readers, not you, exclaim, \'how mysterious!\' or \'loathsome\' or whatever it is. Let me taste for myself, and you\'ll have no need to tell me how I should react.","Hatred obscures all distinctions.","And yet all loneliness, angers, hatreds, envies, and itchings that it contains, if rolled into one single experience and put into the scale against the least moment of the joy that is felt by the least in Heaven, would have no weight that could be registered at all. Bad cannot succeed even in being bad as truly as good is good.","You do not fail in obedience through lack of love, but you have lost love because you never attempted obedience.","Where I come from, they don\'t think much of men who are bossed about by their wives.","I sometimes pray not for self-knowledge in general but for just so much self knowledge at the moment as I can bear and use at the moment; the little daily dose.","Writing is like a \'lust,\' or like \'scratching when you itch.\' Writing comes as a result of a very strong impulse, and when it does come, I for one must get it out.","If people knew how much ill-feeling unselfishness occasions, it would not be so often recommended from the pulpit.","The ancient man approached God (or even the gods)as the accused person approaches his judge. For the modern man the roles are reversed. He is the judge: God is in the dock. He is quite a kindly judge: if God should have a reasonable defense for being the god who permits war, poverty, and disease, he is ready to listen to it. The trial may even end in God\'s acquittal. But the important thing is that Man is on the bench and God is in the dock.","Goodness is, so to speak, itself; badness is only spoiled goodness. And there must be something good first before it can be spoiled.","No thanks,\\" said Digory, \\"I don\'t know that I care much about living on and on after everyone I know is dead. I\'d rather live an ordinary time and die and go to Heaven.","When you are behaving as if you loved someone, you will presently come to love him. If you injure someone you dislike, you will find yourself disliking him more. If you do him a good turn, you will find yourself disliking him less.","I cannot understand how a man can appear in print claiming to disbelieve everything that he presupposes when he puts on the surplice. I feel it is a form of prostitution.","Nothing is more characteristically juvenile than contempt for juvenility. . . youth\'s characteristic chronological snobbery.","Our souls demand Purgatory, don\'t they? Would it not break the heart if God said to us, It is true, my son, that your breath smells and your rags drip with mud and slime, but we are charitable here and no one will upbraid you with these things, nor draw away from you. Enter into joy? Should we not reply, With submission, sir, and if there is no objection, I\'d rather be cleansed first. It may hurt, you know-even so, sir.","I am a product of endless books. My father bought all the books he read and never got rid of any of them. There were books in the study, books in the drawing room, books in the cloakroom, books (two deep) in the great bookcase on the landing, books in a bedroom, books piled as high as my shoulder in the cistern attic...In the seemingly endless rainy afternoons I took volume after volume from the shelves. I had always the same certainty of finding a book that was new to me as a man who walks into a field has of finding a new blade of grass.","Both good and evil, when they are full grown, become retrospective...That is what mortals misunderstand. They say of some temporary suffering, \'No future bliss can make up for it,\' not knowing that Heaven, once attained, will work backwards and turn even that agony into a glory. And of some sinful pleasure they say \'Let me but have this and I\'ll take the consequences\': little dreaming how damnation will spread back and back into their past and contaminate the pleasure of the sin.","Progress means movement in a desired direction, and we do not all desire the same things for our species.","Some have paid me an undeserved compliment by supposing that my Letters were the ripe fruit of many years\' study in moral and ascetic theology. They forgot that there is an equally reliable, though less creditable, way of learning how temptation works.","Besides reasoning about matters of fact, men also make moral judgements.","He\'ll be coming and going\\" he had said. \\"One day you\'ll see him and another you won\'t. He doesn\'t like being tied down--and of course he has other countries to attend to. It\'s quite all right. He\'ll often drop in. Only you mustn\'t press him. He\'s wild, you know. Not like a tame lion.","One of the most dangerous errors is that civilization is automatically bound to increase and spread. The lesson of history is the opposite; civilization is a rarity, attained with difficulty and easily lost. The normal state of humanity is barbarism, just as the normal surface of the planet is salt water. Land looms large in our imagination and civilization in history books, only because sea and savagery are to us less interesting.","You will say these are very small sins... [But] it does not matter how small the sins are provided that their cumulative effect is to edge the man away from the Light and out into the Nothing. Murder is no better than cards if cards can do the trick. Indeed, the safest road to Hell is the gradual one--the gentle slope, soft underfoot, without sudden turnings, without milestones, without signposts","Every sin is the distortion of an energy breathed into us - an energy which, if not thus distorted, would have blossomed into one of those holy acts whereof \'God did it\' and \'I did it\' are both true descriptions.","The action of Pity leaps quicker than light from the highest place to the lowest to bring healing and joy, whatever the cost to itself. It changes darkness into light and evil into good. But it will not, at the cunning tears of Hell, impose on good the tyranny of evil. Every disease that submits to a cure shall be cured: but we will not call blue yellow to please those who insist on having jaundice, nor make a midden of the world\'s garden for the sake of some who cannot abide the smell of roses.","I could well believe that it is God\'s intention, since we have refused milder remedies, to compel [Christians] into unity, by persecution even. Satan is without doubt nothing else than a hammer in the hand of a benevolent and severe God.","We regard God as an airman regards his parachute; it\'s there for emergencies but he hopes he\'ll never have to use it.","The only moral that is of any value is that which arises inevitably from the whole cast of the author\'s mind.","Is there any possibility of getting the super Welfare State\'s honey and avoiding the sting?","The question about progress has become the question whether we can discover any way of submitting to the worldwide paternalism of a technocracy without losing all personal privacy and independence. Is there any possibility of getting the super Welfare State\'s honey and avoiding the sting?","There is wishful thinking in Hell as well as on Earth.","There is hope for a man who has never read Malory or Boswell or Tristam Shandy or Shakespeare\'s Sonnets: but what can you do with a man who says he \\"has read\\" them, meaning he has read them once, and thinks that this settles the matter?","If I, being what I am, can consider that I am in some sense a Christian, why should the different vices of those people in the next pew prove that their religion is mere hypocrisy and convention?","[The natural life] knows that if the spiritual life gets hold of it, all its self-centredness and self-will are going to be killed and it is ready to fight tooth and nail to avoid that.","Necessity may not be the opposite of freedom, and perhaps a man is most free when, instead of producing motives, he could only say, \\"I am what I do.","Whatever he says, let his inner resolution be not to bear whatever comes to him, but to bear it \'for a reasonable period\'--and let the reasonable period be shorter than the trial is likely to last. It need not be much shorter; in attacks on patience, chastity, and fortitude, the fun is to make the man yield just when (had he but known it) relief was almost in sight.","Christianity tells people to repent and promises them forgiveness. It therefore has nothing (as far as I know) to say to people who do not know they have done anything to repent of and who do not feel that they need forgiveness.","If you have a religion it must be cosmic.","I can answer that only by hearsay, returned the Guide, for pain is a secret which he has shared with your race and not with mine; and you would find it as hard to explain suffering to me as I would find it to reveal to you the secrets of the Mountain people. But those who know best say this, that any liberal man would choose the pain of this desire, even for ever, rather than the peace of feeling it no longer; and that though the best thing is to have, the next best is to want, and the worst of all is not to want.","The State exists simply to promote and to protect the ordinary happiness of human beings in this life. A husband and wife chatting over a fire, a couple of friends having a game of darts in a pub, a man reading a book in his own room or digging in his own garden-that is what the State is there for. And unless they are helping to increase and prolong and protect such moments, all the laws, parliaments, armies, courts, police, economics, etc., are simply a waste of time.","A recovery of the old sense of sin is essential to Christianity. Christ takes it for granted that men are bad. Until we really feel this assumption of His to be true, though we are part of the world He came to save, we are not part of the audience to whom His words are addressed.","God is, if I may say it, very unscrupulous","Power to translate is the test of having really understood one\'s own meaning.","It is so fatally easy to confuse an aesthetic appreciation of the spiritual life with the life itself-to dream that you have waked, washed, and dressed and then to find yourself still in bed.","A great many people (not you) do now seem to think that the mere state of being worried is in itself meritorious. I don\u2019t think it is. We must, if it so happens, give our lives for others: but even while we\u2019re doing it, I think we\u2019re meant to enjoy Our Lord and, in Him, our friends, our food, our sleep, our jokes, and the birds\u2019 song and the frosty sunrise.","A Catholic priest, a Jewish rabbi, and a Muslim mullah all walk into a bar, and the bartender says:\\n - What is this, a joke?\\n - \u0421hurch is the only organization that exists primarily for the benefit of non-members.","Pure, spiritual, intellectual love shot form their faces like barbedlightning. It was so unlike the love we experience that its expressioncould easily be mistaken for ferocity.","We have lost the invaluable faculty of being shocked a faculty which has hitherto almost distinguished the Man or Woman from the beast or child.","Non-Christians seem to think that the Incarnation implies some particular merit or excellence in humanity. But of course it implies just the reverse: a particular demerit and depravity. No creature that deserved Redemption would need to be redeemed. They that are whole need not the physician. Christ died for men precisely because men are not worth dying for; to make them worth it.","People who know a lot of the same things can hardly help talking about them.","The desire for bad art is the desire bred of habit: like the smoker\'s desire for tobacco, more marked by the extreme malaise of denial than by any very strong delight in fruition.","No good poem, however confessional it may be, is just a self-expression.  Who on earth would claim that the pearl expresses the oyster?","Unless the religious claims of the Bible are again acknowledged, its literary claims will, I think, be given only \'mouth honour\' and that decreasingly.","A man who has been in another world does not come back unchanged. One can\'t put the difference into words. When the man is a friend it may become painful: the old footing is not easy to recover.","Please will you do my job for me.","Of course language is not an infallible guide, but it contains, with all its defects, a good deal of stored insight and experience.","Have you not seen that in our days\\n Of any whose story, song or art\\n Delights us, our sincerest praise\\n Means, when all\'s said, \'You break my heart?","One of the marks of a certain type of bad man is that he cannot give up a thing himself without wanting everyone else to give it up.","This is my endlessly recurrent temptation: to go down to that Sea, and there neither dive nor swim nor float, but only dabble and splash, careful not to get out of my depth and holding on to the lifeline which connects me with my things temporal.","You are guilty of no evil, Ransom of Thulcandra, except a little fearfulness. For that, the journey you go on is your pain, and perhaps your cure: for you must be either mad or brave before it is ended.","They tell me, Lord, that when I seem\\nTo be in speech with you.\\nSince but one voice is heard, it","My will, shall become your will. My heart, shall become your heart.","In our world,\\" said Eustace, \\"a star is a huge ball of flaming gas.\\" Even in your world, my son, that is not what a star is, but only what it is made of.","Girls aren\'t very good at keeping maps in their brains\\", said Edmund, \\"That\'s because we\'ve got something in them\\", replied Lucy.","The people who keep asking if they can\'t lead a decent life without Christ, don\'t know what life is about; if they did they would know that \'a decent life\' is mere machinery compared with the thing we men are really made for.","But do you really mean, Sir,\\" said Peter, \\"that there could be other worlds-all over the place, just round the corner-like that?\\" \\"Nothing is more probable,\\" said the Profesor, taking off his spectacles and beginning to polish them, while he muttered to himself, \\"I wonder what they do teach them at these schools.","...the sun looks down on nothing half so good as a household laughing together over a meal, or two friends talking over a pint of beer, or a man alone reading a book that interests him...\\" - C.S. Lewis: Weight of Glory","Aslan is a lion- the Lion, the great Lion.\\" \\"Ooh\\" said Susan. \\"I\'d thought he was a man. Is he-quite safe? I shall feel rather nervous about meeting a lion\\"...\\"Safe?\\" said Mr Beaver ...\\"Who said anything about safe? \'Course he isn\'t safe. But he\'s good. He\'s the King, I tell you.","Even in this world of course it is the stupidest children who are most childish and the stupidest grown-ups who are most grown-up.","The sin both of men and of angels, was rendered possible by the fact that God gave us free will.","A myth is a lie that conveys a truth.","Walking and talking are two very great pleasures, but it is a mistake to combine them. Our own noise blots out the sounds and silences of the outdoor world; and talking leads almost inevitably to smoking, and then farewell to nature as far as one of our senses is concerned. The only friend to walk with is one who so exactly shares your taste for each mood of the countryside that a glance, a halt, or at most a nudge, is enough to assure us that the pleasure is shared.","The human qualities of the raw materials show through. Naivety, error, contradiction, even (as in the cursing Psalms) wickedness are not removed. The total result is not \\"the Word of God\\" in the sense that every passage in itself, gives impeccable science or history. It carries the Word of God.","Of course it should be pointed out that, though all salvation is through Jesus, we need not conclude that he cannot save those who have not explicitly accepted him in this life.","As for all I can tell, the only difference is that what many see we call a real thing, and what only one sees we call a dream.","Jesus was either a Liar, a Lunatic, or Lord","To love at all is to be vulnerable. Love anything, and your heart will most certainly be wrung and possibly broken ... The only place outside Heaven where you can be perfectly safe from all the dangers and perturbations of love is Hell.","Aren\'t all these notes the senseless writings of a man who won\'t accept the fact that there is nothing we can do with suffering except to suffer it?","Here the whole world (stars, water, air, And field, and forest, as they were Reflected in a single mind) Like cast off clothes was left behind In ashes, yet with hopes that she, Re-born from holy poverty, In lenten lands, hereafter may Resume them on her Easter Day.\\" (Epitaph for Joy Gresham)","I sometimes think that shame, mere awkward, senseless shame, does as much towards preventing good acts and straightforward happiness as any of our vices can do.","For Christianity is a fighting religion. It thinks God has made the world- that space and time, heat and cold, and all the colors and tastes, and all the animals and vegetables, are things that God \'made up out of His head\' as a man makes up a story. But it also thinks that a great many things have gone wrong with the world that God made and that God insists, and insists very loudly, on our putting them right again.","Scripture itself is not systematic; the New Testament shows the greatest variety. God has shown us that he can use any instrument. Balaam\'s ass, you remember, preached a very effective sermon in the midst of his \'hee-haws.\'","It\'s always winter but it\'s never Christmas.","Unless Christianity is wholly false, the perception of ourselves which we have in moments of shame must be the only true one.","If you examined a hundred people who had lost their faith in Christianity, I wonder how many of them would turn out to have reasoned out of it by honest argument? Do not most people simply drift away?","\'Useful,\' and \'necessity\' was always \'the tyrant\'s plea\'.","If Christianity was something we were making up, of course we could make it easier. But it is not. We cannot compete, in simplicity with people who are inventing religions. How could we? We are dealing with Fact. Of course anyone can be simple if he has no facts to bother about.","To excuse what can really produce good excuses is not Christian charity; it is only fairness. To be a Christian means to forgive the inexcusable in you.","In justifying cruelty to animals we put ourselves also on the animal level. We choose the jungle and must abide by our choice.","At other times it feels like being mildly drunk, or concussed. There is a sort of invisible blanket between the world and me. I find it hard to take in what anyone says.","You can\'t see anything properly while your eyes are blurred with tears.","What flows into you from myth is not truth but reality (truth is always about something, but reality is that about which truth is), and therefore, every myth becomes the father of innumerable truths on the abstract level.","On many questions and specially in view of the marriage bed, the Puritans were the indulgent party, . . . they were much more Chestertonian than their adversaries. The idea that a Puritan was a repressed and repressive person would have astonished Sir Thomas More and Luther about equally.","Shall I ever be able to read that story again; the one I couldn\'t remember? Will you tell it to me, Aslan? Oh do,do,do.\\" \\"Indeed,yes, I will tell it to you for years and years. But now, come. We must meet the master of this house.","At all ages, if [fantasy and myth] is used well by the author and meets the right reader, it has the same power: to generalize while remaining concrete, to present in palpable form not concepts or even experiences but whole classes of experience, and to throw off irrelevancies. Bat at its best it can do more; it can give us experiences we have never had and thus, instead of \'commenting on life,\' can add to it.","What he says, even on his knees, about his own sinfulness is all parrot talk. At bottom, he still believes he has run up a very favorable credit-balance in the Enemy\'s ledger by allowing himself to be converted, and thinks that he is showing great humility and condescension in going to church with these \'smug\', commonplace neighbors at all.","He thinks great folly, child,\' said Aslan. \\"This world is bursting with life for these few days because the song with which I called it into life still hangs in the air and rumbles in the ground. It will not be so for long. But I cannot tell that to this old sinner, and I cannot comfort him either; he has made himself unable to hear my voice. If I spoke to him, he would hear only growlings and roarings. Oh, Adam\'s son, how cleverly you defend yourself against all that might do you good!","if anyone present wishes to make me the subject of his wit, I am very much at his service--with my sword--whenever he has leisure.","So that the one road for which we now need God\'s leadership most of all is a road God, in His own nature, has never walked. But suppose God became a man... He could surrender His will, suffer and die, because He was a man.","But in general, take my advice, when you meet anything that is going to be Human and isn\u2019t yet, or used to be Human once and isn\u2019t now, or ought to be Human and isn\u2019t, you keep your eyes on it and feel for your hatchet.","It is, of course, quite true that God will not love you any less, or have less use for you, if you happen to have been born with a very second-rate brain.","When he was a young man he prayed constantly for chastity; but years later he realized that while his lips had been saying \'Oh Lord, make me chaste,\' his heart had been secretly adding, \'But please don\'t do it just yet.","We may not be able to get certainty, but we can get probability, and half a loaf is better than no bread.","Everyone says that forgiveness is a lovely idea until he has something to forgive yet tasted one of the most sublime enjoyments of life.","Once in those very early days my brother brought into the nursery the lid of a biscuit tin which he had covered with moss and garnished with twigs and flowers so as to make it a toy garden or a toy forest. That was the first beauty I ever knew. What the real garden had failed to do, the toy garden did. It made me aware of nature-not, indeed, as a storehouse of forms and colors but as something cool, dewy, fresh, exuberant....As long as I live my imagination of Paradise will retain something of my brother\'s toy garden.","I think we must fully face the fact that when Christianity does not make a man very much better, it makes him very much worse... Conversion may make of one who was, if no better, no worse than an animal, something like a devil.","Friendship arises out of mere Companionship when two or more of the companions discover that they have in common some insight or interest or even taste which the others do not share and which, till that moment, each believed to be his own unique treasure (or burden).","When you invite a middle-aged moralist to address you, I suppose I must conclude that you have a taste for middle-aged moralizing.","The worst attitude of all would be the professional attitude which regards children in the lump as a sort of raw material which we have to handle.","A universe whose only claim to be believed in rests on the validity of inference must not start telling us the inference is invalid.","We must sometimes get away from the Authorized Version, if for no other reason, simply because it is so beautiful and so solemn. Beauty exalts, but beauty also lulls. Early associations endear, but they also confuse. Through that beautiful solemnity, the transporting or horrifying realities of which the Book tells may come to us blunted and disarmed, and we may only sigh with tranquil veneration when we ought to be burning with shame, or struck dumb with terror, or carried out of ourselves by ravishing hopes and adorations.","The value of the Old Testament may be dependant on what seems its imperfection. It may repel one use in order that we may be forced to use it in another way-to find the Word in it...to re-live, while we read, the whole Jewish experience of God\'s gradual and graded self-revelation, to feel the very contentions between the Word and the human material through which it works.","If they embark on this course the difference between the old and the new education will be an important one. Where the old initiated, the new merely \'conditions\'. The old dealt with its pupils as grown birds deal with young birds when they teach them to fly; the new deals with them more as the poultry-keeper deals with young birds- making them thus or thus for purposes of which the birds know nothing. In a word, the old was a kind of propagation-men transmitting manhood to men; the new is merely propaganda.","Write about what really interests you, whether it is real things or imaginary things, and nothing else. (Notice this means that if you are interested only in writing you will never be a writer, because you will have nothing to write about...)","Thus, and not otherwise, the world was made. Either something or nothing must depend on individual choices.","If God thinks this state of war in the universe a price worth paying for free will...then we may take it it is worth paying.","Truth and falsehood are opposed; but truth is the norm not of truth only but of falsehood also.","Human intellect is incurably abstract.","The more lucidly we think, the more we are cut off: the more deeply we enter into reality, the less we can think.","There was nothing medieval people liked better, or did better, than sorting out and tidying up. Of all our modern inventions I suspect that they would most have admired the card index.","Man has got to take charge of Man.... Then real education, including pre-natal education. By real education I mean one that has no \'take-it-or-leave-it\' nonsense. A real education makes the patient what it wants infallibly: whatever he or his parents try to do about it. Of course, it\'ll have to be mainly psychological at first. But we\'ll get on to biochemical conditioning int he end and direct manipulation of the brain.","The assumption that things which have been conjured in the past will always be conjured in the guiding principle not of rational but of animal behavior.","Every object you see before you at this moment -the walls, ceiling, and furniture, the book, your own washed hands and cut fingernails, bears witness to the colonization of Nature of Reason.","If we continue to make moral judgements (and whatever we say shall in fact continue) then we must believe that the conscience of man is not a product of nature.","The longest way round is the shortest way home","God is basic Fact. He must not be thought of as a featureless generality. He is the most concrete thing there is.","There seems no plan because it is all plan.","It\'s like the sound of a chuckle in the darkness. The sense that some shattering and disarming simplicity is the real answer.","Monarchy can easily be \\"debunked,\\" but watch the faces, mark well the debunkers. These are the men whose taproot in Eden has been cut: whom no rumour of the polyphony, the dance, can reach - men to whom pebbles laid in a row are more beautiful than an arch. Where men are forbidden to honour a king they honour millionaires, athletes or film stars instead: For spiritual nature, like bodily nature, will be served; deny it food and it will gobble poison.","We hear a great deal about the rudeness of the rising generation. I am an oldster myself and might be expected to take the oldsters\' side, but in fact I have been far more impressed by the bad manners of parents to children than by those of children to parents.","It is usual to speak in a playfully apologetic tone about one\'s adult enjoyment of what are called \'children\'s books.\' I think the convention a silly one. No book is really worth reading at the age of ten which is not equally (and often far more) worth reading at the age of fifty-except, of course, books of information. The only imaginative works we ought to grow out of are those which it would have been better not to have read at all. A mature palate will probably not much care for cr\xe8me de menthe: but it ought still to enjoy bread and butter and honey.","If we ignore it the truth that God is love may slyly come to mean for us the converse, that love is God.","The point is that for our ancestors, the universe was a picture; for modern physics it is a story.","A glimpse is not a vision. But to a man on a mountain road by night, a glimpse of the next three feet of road may matter more than a vision of the horizon.","Enemy-occupied territory - that is what this world is.","Pain is G-d\'s megaphone to wake up the world.","Only real risk passes the reality of faith.","There is no use saying you chose to lie down when it has become impossible to stand up.","Most people spend most of their lives doing neither what they want to be doing nor what they ought to be doing.","When the voice of your friend or the page of your book sinks into democratic equality with the pattern of the wallpaper, the feel of your clothes, your memory of last night, and the noises from the road, you are falling asleep. The highly selective consciousness enjoyed by fully alert men, with all its builded sentiments and consecrated ideals, has as much to be called real as the drowsy chaos, and more.","Lucy went first, biting her lip and trying not to say all the things she thought of saying to Susan. But she forgot them when she fixed her eyes on Aslan.","Perhaps the experience had been so complete that repetition would be vulgarity - like asking to hear the same symphony twice in a day.","You don\u2019t think \u2013 not possibly \u2013 not as a mere hundredth chance \u2013 there might be things that are real though we can\u2019t see them? \u2026 If there are souls, could there not be soul-houses?","And so take away his work, which was his life [. . .] and all his glory and his great deeds? Make a child and a dotard of him? Keep him to myself at that cost? Make him so mine that he was no longer his?","This is our dilemma--either to taste and not to know or to know and not to taste--or, more strictly, to lack one kind of knowledge because we are in an experience or to lack another kind because we are outside it. [. . .] Of this tragic dilemma myth is the partial solution. In the enjoyment of a great myth we come nearest to experiencing as a concrete what can otherwise be understood only as an abstraction.","The real moon,if you could reach it and survive it, would in a deep and deadly sense be just like anywhere else...no man would find an abiding strangness on the moon unless he were the sort of man who could find it in his own back garden.","My own idea, for what it is worth, is that all sadness which is not either arising from the repentance of a concrete sin and hastening towards concrete amendment or restitution, or else arising from pity and hastening to active assistance, is simply bad; and I think we all sin by needlessly disobeying the apostolic injunction to \'rejoice\' as much as by anything else. Humility, after the first shock, is a cheerful virtue.","The student is half afraid to meet one of the great philosophers face to face. He feels himself inadequate and thinks he will not understand him. But if he only knew, the great man, just because of his greatness, is much more intelligible than his modern commentator. The simplest student will be able to understand, if not all, yet a very great deal of what Plato said; but hardly anyone can understand some modern books on Platonism.","Whenever all men are...hastening to be slaves or tyrants we make Liberalism the prime bogey.","It is no disparagement to the garden to say it will not fence and weed itself, nor prune its own fruit trees, nor roll and cut its own lawns...It will remain a garden only if someone does all these things to it...If you want to see the difference between [the garden\'s] contribution and the gardener\'s, put the commonest weed it grows side by side with his hoes rakes, shears, and a packet of weed killer; you have put beauty, energy, and fecundity beside dead, steril things. Just so, our \'decency and common sense\' show grey and deathlike beside the geniality of love.","The mark of Friendship is not that help will be given when the pinch comes (of course it will) but that, having been given, it makes no difference at all.","Once a King in Narnia, always a King in Narnia. But don\'t go trying to use the same route twice. Indeed, don\'t try to get there at all. It\'ll happen when you\'re not looking for it. And don\'t talk too much about it even among yourselves. And don\'t mention it to anyone else unless you find that they\'ve had adventures of the same sort themselves. What\'s that? How will you know? Oh, you\'ll know all right. Odd things, they say-even their looks-will let the secret out. Keep your eyes open. Bless me, what do they teach them at these schools.\\" -The Profesor","That\'s the worst of girls,\\" said Edmund to Peter and the Dwarf. \\"They never can carry a map in their heads.\\" \\"That\'s because our heads have something inside them,\\" said Lucy.","Stop it,\\" spluttered Eustace, \\"go away. Put that thing away. It\'s not safe. Stop it, I say. I\'ll tell Caspian. I\'ll have you muzzled and tied up.\\" \\"Why do you not draw your own sword, poltroon!\\" cheeped the Mouse. \\"Draw and fight or I\'ll beat you black and blue with the flat.\\" \\"I haven\'t got one,\\" said Eustace. \\"I\'m a pacifist. I don\'t believe in fighting.\\" \\"Do I understand,\\" said Reepicheep, withdrawing his sword for a moment and speaking very sternly, \\"that you do not intend to give me satisfaction?","The worst of sleeping out of doors is that you wake up so dreadfully early. And when you wake up you have to get up because the ground is so hard you are uncomfortable. And it makes matters worse if there is nothing but apples for breakfast and you have had nothing but apples for supper the night before.","Well, whatever they say, you don\'t feel like ghosts.","And that\'s why, when they want to get rid of anyone, they usually bring him down here (like they were doing with me) and say they\'ll leave him to the ghosts. But I always wondered if they didn\'t really drown \'em or cut their throats. I never quite believed in the ghosts. But those two cowards you\'ve just shot believed all right. They were more scared of taking me to my death than I was of going.","Oh, I\'m a dangerous criminal, I am,\' said the dwarf cheerfully.","You have no idea what an appetite it gives one, being executed.","This wasn\'t a garden,\' said Susan presently. \'It was a castle.","I\'m afraid it\'s not much use to you, Mr. Rumblebuffin.\' Not at all. Not at all.\' said the giant politely. \'Never met a nicer hankerchee.","At least he went on saying this till Aslan had loaded him up with three dwarfs, one dryad, two rabbits, and a hedgehog, that steadied him a bit.","I expect you have seen someone put a a lighted match to a bit of newspaper which is propped up in a grate against an unlit fire. And for a second nothing seems to have happened; and then you notice a tiny steak of flame creeping along the edged of the newspaper. It was like that now.","Ah, poor Pole. It\'s been to much for her, this last bit. Turned her head, I shouldn\'t wonder. She\'s beginning to see things.","The whole journey was odd and dream-like -- the roaring stream, the wet grey grass, the glimmering cliffs which they were approaching, and always the glorious, silently pacing beast ahead.","Her face was working and twitching with passion, but his looked up at the sky, still quiet, neither angry nor afraid, but a little sad.","When there came a sound that I\'d never heard the like of in all my born days. Eh, I won\'t forget that. The whole air was full of it, loud as thunder but far longer, cool and sweet as music over water but strong enough to shake the woods. And I said to myself, \'If that\'s not the Horn, call me a rabbit.","No interviews without appointments except between nine and ten p.m. on second Saturdays.","The Calormens have dark faces and long beards. They wear flowing robes and orange-colored turbans, and they are a wise, wealthy, courteous, cruel and ancient people. They bowed most politely to Caspian and paid him long compliments all about the fountains of prosperity irrigating the gardens of prudence and virtue --and things like that-- but of course what they wanted was the money they had paid.","For his mind was full of forlorn hopes, death-or-glory charges, and last stands.","A powerful dragon crying its eyes out under the moon in a deserted valley is a sight and a sound hardly to be imagined.","He didn\'t call his father and mother \'Father\' and \'Mother\' but Harold and Alberta. They were very up to date and advanced people. They were vegetarians, non-smokers and teetotalers, and wore a special kind of underclothes. In their house there was very little furniture and very few clothes on the beds and the windows were always open.","And there we all were, as invisible as you could wish to see.","And that\'s why, gentleman, if your little girl doesn\'t come up to scratch, it will be our painful duty to cut all your throats. Merely in a way of business, as you might say, and no offense, I hope.","Gone! ...And you and I quite crestfallen.","Here are beauties which pierce like swords or burn like cold iron. Here is a book [The Lord of the Rings] which will break your heart.\\"","Fancy sleeping on air. I wonder if anyone\'s done it before. I don\'t suppose they have. Oh, bother\u2014-Scrubb probably has!","When the police arrived and found no lion, no broken wall, and no convicts, and the Head behaving like a lunatic, there was an inquiry into the whole thing. And in the inquiry all sorts of things about Experiment House came out, and about ten people got expelled. After that, the Head\'s friends saw that the Head was no use as a Head, so they got her made an Inspector to interfere with other Heads. And when they found she wasn\'t much good even at that, they got her into Parliament where she lived happily ever after.","They call him Aslan in That Place,\\" said Eustace. \\"What a curious name!\\" \\"Not half so curious as himself,\\" said Eustace solemnly.","For in Calormen, story-telling (whether the stories are true or made up) is a thing you\'re taught, just as English boys and girls are taught essay-writing. The difference is that people want to hear the stories, whereas I never heard of anyone who wanted to read the essays.","My son, by all means desist from kicking the venerable and enlightened Vizier: for as a costly jewel retains its value even if hidden in a dung-hill, so old age and discretion are to be respected even in the vile persons of our subjects. Desist therefore, and tell us what you desire and propose.","Kindness consents very readily to the removal of its object \u2013 we have all met people whose kindness to animals is constantly leading them to kill animals lest they should suffer. Kindness, merely as such, cares not whether its object becomes good or bad, provided only that it escapes suffering.","If the world is meaningless, then so are we; if we mean something, we do not mean alone.","[S]omething inside us, the feeling of resentment, the feeling that wants to get one\'s own back, must be simply killed. I do not mean that anyone can decide this moment that he will never feel it anymore. That is not how things happen. I mean that every time it bobs its head up, day after day, year after year, all our lives long, we must hit it on the head. It is hard work, but the attempt is not impossible.","Those that hate goodness are sometimes nearer than those that know nothing at all about it and think they have it.","I see people, as they approach me, trying to make up their minds whether they\'ll \'say something about it\' or not. I hate if they do, and if they don\'t.","They say, \'The coward dies many times\'; so does the beloved. Didn\'t the eagle find a fresh liver to tear in Prometheus every time it dined?","See the bear in his own den before you judge of his conditions.","I daren\'t come and drink,\\" said Jill. Then you will die of thirst,\\" said the Lion. Oh dear!\\" said Jill, coming another step nearer.\\"I suppose I must go and look for another stream then.\\" There is no other stream,\\" said the Lion.","Christian principles are, admittedly, stricter than the others; but then we think you will get help towards obeying them which you will not get towards obeying the others.","The Christian idea of marriage is based on Christ\'s words that a man and wife are to be regarded as a single organism - for that is what the words \'one flesh\' would be in modern English. And the Christians believe that when He said this He was not expressing a sentiment but stating a fact - just as one is stating a fact when one says that a lock and its key are one mechanism, or that a violin and a bow are one musical instrument.","The promise, made when I am in love and because I am in love, to be true to the beloved as long as I live, commits me to being true even if I cease to be in love. A promise must be about things that I can do, about actions: no one can promise to go on feeling in a certain way. He might as well promise to never have a headache or always to feel hungry.","The change which the writing wrought in me (and of which I did not write) was only a beginning; only to prepare me for the gods\' surgery. They used my own pen to probe my wound.","Materialism is in fact no protection. Those who seek it in that hope (they are not a negligible class) will be disappointed. The thing you fear is impossible. Well and good. Can you therefore cease to fear it? Not here and now. And what then? If you must see ghosts, it is better not to disbelieve in them.","My friendship you shall have, leanred Man,\\" piped Reepicheep. \\"And any Dwarf--or Giant---in the army who does not give you good language shall have my sword to reckon with.","A pleasure is full grown only when it is remembered. You are speaking, Hm\xe1n, as if pleasure were one thing and the memory another. It is all one thing.","I think He made one law of that kind in order that there might be obedience. In all these other matters what you call obeying Him is but doing what seems good in your own eyes also. Is love content with that?","Your Majesty would have a perfect right to strike off his head,\\" said Peridan. \\"Such an assault as he made puts him on a level with assassins.\\" \\"It is very true,\\" said Edmund. \\"But even a traitor may mend. I have known one that did.\\" And he looked very thoughtful.","But no one except Lucy knew that as it circled the mast it had whispered to her, \\"Courage, dear heart,\\" and the voice, she felt sure, was Aslan\'s, and with the voice a delicious smell breathed in her face.","Fools!\\" said the man, stamping his foot with rage. \\"That is the sort of talk that brought me here, and I\'d better have been drowned or never born. Do you hear what I say? This is where dreams \u2014 dreams, do you understand \u2014 come to life, come real. Not daydreams: dreams.","this is a book about something","I am only trying to call attention to a fact; the fact that this year, of this month, or, more likely, this very day, we have failed to practice ourselves the kind of behaviour we expect from other people.","Either the day must come when joy prevails and all the makers of misery are no longer able to infect it, or else, for ever and ever, the makers of misery can destroy in others the happiness they reject for themselves.","Never forget that when we are dealing with any pleasure in its healthy and normal and satisfying form, we are, in a sense, on the Enemy\u2019s (God\u2019s) ground\u2026He [God] made the pleasure: all our research so far has not enabled us to produce one. All we can do is to encourage the humans to take the pleasures which our Enemy [God] has produced, at at times, or in ways, or in degrees, which He [God] has forbidden.","I\'m hunger. I\'m thirst. Where I bite, I hold till I die, and even after death they must cut out my mouthful from my enemy\'s body and bury it with me. I can fast a hundred years and not die. I can lie a hundred nights on the ice and not freeze. I can drink a river of blood and not burst. Show me your enemies.","A tyrannous and gluttonous demand for affection can be a horrible thing. But in ordinary life no one calls a child selfish because it turns for comfort to its mother; nor an adult who turns to his fellow \\"for company.\\" Those, whether children or adults, who do so least are not usually the most selfless.","I have discovered, passionate grief does not link us with the dead but cuts us off from them. This becomes clearer and clearer. It is just at those moments when I feel least sorrow - getting into my morning bath is usually one of them - that H. rushes upon my mind in her full reality, her otherness. Not, as in my worst moments, all foreshortened and patheticized and solemnized by my miseries, but as she is in her own right. This is good and tonic.","A man\'s physical hunger does not prove that man will get any bread; he may die of starvation on a raft in the Atlantic. But surely a man\'s hunger does prove that he comes of a race which repairs its body by eating and inhabits a world where eatable substances exist. In the same way, though I do not believe (I wish I did) that my desire for Paradise proves that I shall enjoy it, I think it a pretty good indication that such a thing exists and that some men will.","Far overhead from beyond the veil of blue sky which hid them the stars sang again; a pure, cold, difficult music. Then there came a swift flash like fire (but it burnt nobody) either from the sky or from the Lion itself, and every drop of blood tingled in the children\'s bodies, and the deepest, wildest voice they had ever heard was saying: \\"Narnia, Narnia, Narnia, awake. Love. Think. Speak. Be walking trees. Be talking beasts. Be divine waters.","Bridge-players tell me that there must be some money on the game \'or else people won\'t take it seriously\'. Apparently it\'s like that. Your bid - for God or no God, for a good God or the Cosmic Sadist, for eternal life or nonentity - will not be serious if nothing much is staked on it. And you will never discover how serious it was until the stakes are raised horribly high, until you find that you are playing not for counters or for sixpences but for every penny you have in the world.","Lucy said, \'We\'re so afraid of being sent away, Aslan. And you have sent us back into our own world so often.\' \'No fear of that,\' said Aslan. \'Have you not guessed?\' Their hearts leapt, and a wild hope rose within them. \'There was a real railway accident,\' said Aslan softly. \'Your father and mother and all of you are- as you used to call it in the Shadowlands- dead. The term is over: the holidays have begun. The dream is ended: this is the morning.","Periods\' are largely an invention of the historians. The poets themselves are not conscious of living in any period and refuse to conform to the scheme.","Are the gods not just?\' \'Oh no, child. What would become us us if they were?","Do not look sad. We shall meet soon again.\\" \\"Please, Aslan\\", said Lucy,\\"what do you call soon?\\" \\"I call all times soon\\" said Aslan; and instantly he was vanished away.","Till that word can be dug out of us, why should they hear the babble that we think we mean? How can they meet us face to face till we have faces?","Slowly, quietly, like snow-flakes\u2014like the small flakes that come when it is going to snow all night \u2014little flakes of me, my impressions, my selections, are settling down on the image of her. The real shape wil be quite hidden in the end.","The grave and the image are equally links with the irrecoverable and symbols for the unimaginable.","I could never have gone far in any science because on the path of every science the lion Mathematics lies in wait for you.","Poetry most often communicates emotions, not directly, but by creating imaginatively the grounds for those emotions. It therefore communicates something more than the emotion; only by means of that something more does it communicate the emotion at all.","You all know,\\" said the Guide, \\"that security is mortals\' greatest enemy.","the Divine Nature wounds and perhaps destroys us merely by being what it is.","It may well be that by trickery of priests men have sometimes taken a mortal\'s voice for a god\'s. But it will not work the other way. No one who hears a god\'s voice takes it for a man\'s.","And for all I can tell, the only difference is that what many see we call a real thing, and what only one sees we call a dream. But things that many see may have no taste or moment in them at all, and things that are shown only to one may be spears and water-spouts of truth from the very depth of truth.","I felt ashamed.\\" \\"But of what? Psyche, they hadn\'t stripped you naked or anything?\\" \\"No, no, Maia. Ashamed of looking like a mortal -- of being a mortal.\\" \\"But how could you help that?\\" \\"Don\'t you think the things people are most ashamed of are things they can\'t help?","If they won\'t write the kind of books we like to read we shall have to write them ourselves.","I haven\'t any language weak enough to depict the weakness of my spiritual life. If I weakened it enough it would cease to be language at all. As when you try to turn the gas-ring a little lower still, and it merely goes out.","And there\u2019s also \u2018To him that hath shall be given.\u2019 After all, you must have a capacity to receive, or even omnipotence can\u2019t give. Perhaps your own passion temporarily destroys the capacity.","This must be a simply enormous wardrobe!","But if you are a poor creature--poisoned by a wretched up-bringing in some house full of vulgar jealousies and senseless quarrels--saddled, by no choice of your own, with some loathsome sexual perversion--nagged day in and day out by an inferiority complex that makes you snap at your best friends--do not despair. He knows all about it. You are one of the poor whom He blessed. He knows what a wretched machine you are trying to drive. Keep on. Do what you can. One day He will fling it on the scrap-heap and give you a new one. And then you may astonish us all - not least yourself.","The proper good of a creature is to surrender itself to its Creator\u2014to enact intellectually, volitionally, and emotionally, that relationship which is given in the mere fact of its being a creature. When it does so, it is good and happy.","Gone! And you and I quite crestfallen. It\u2019s always like that, you can\u2019t keep him; it\u2019s not as if he were a tame lion.","An open mind, in questions that are not ultimate, is useful. But an open mind about the ultimate foundations either of Theoretical or of Practical Reason is idiocy. If a man\'s mind is open on these things, let his mouth at least be shut. He can say nothing to the purpose. Outside the Tao there is no ground for criticizing either the Tao or anything else.","But as for Lucy, she was always gay and golden-haired, and all princes in those parts desired her to be their Queen, and her own people called her Queen Lucy the Valiant.","Be sure it is not for nothing that the Landlord has knit our hearts so closely to time and place \u2013 to one friend rather than another and one shire more that all the land.","When you and I met, the meeting was over very shortly, it was nothing. Now it is growing something as we remember it, what will it be when I remember it as I lie down to die, what it makes in me all my days till then - that is the real meeting. The other is only the beginning of it. You say you have poets in your world. Do they not teach you this?","Things always work according to their nature.","Pilate was merciful till it became risky.","You die and die and then you are beyond death.","Good beats upon the damned incessantly as sound waves beat on the ears of the deaf, but they cannot receive it. Their fists are clenched, their teeth are clenched, their eyes fast shut. First they will not, in the end they cannot, open their hands for gifts, or their mouth for food, or their eyes to see.","For the power of Man to make himself what he pleases means... the power of some men to make other men what THEY please.","Beloved,\\" said the Glorious One, \\"unless thy desire had been for me thou wouldst not have sought so long and so truly. For all find what they truly seek.","Autumn is really the best of the seasons; and I\'m not sure that old age isn\'t the best part of life.","Total war is the most humane in the long run.","Unless thought is valid we have no reason to believe in the real universe.","We might think that God wanted simply obedience to a set of rules: whereas He really wants people of a particular sort.","Now Eros makes a man really want, not a woman, but one particular woman. In some mysterious but quite indisputable fashion the lover desires the Beloved herself, not the pleasure she can give.","One flesh. Or if you prefer, one ship. The starboard engine has gone. I, the port engine, must chug along somehow till we make harbour. Or rather, till the journey ends.","Not to be, but to seem, virtuous - it is a formula whose utility we all discovered in the nursery.","I am suffering incessant temptations to uncharitable thoughts at present; one of those black moods in which nearly all one\'s friends seem to be selfish or even false. And how terrible that there should be even a kind of pleasure in thinking evil.","It\'s all love or sex these days. Friendship is almost as quaint and outdated a notion as chastity. Soon friends will be like the elves and the pixies - fabulous mythical creatures from a distant past.","Is it easy to love God\' asks an old author. \'It is easy,\' he replies, \'to those who do it.\' I have included two Graces under the word Charity. But God can give a third. He can awake in man, towards Himself, a supernatural Appreciative love. This is of all gifts the most to be desired. Here, not in our natural loves, nor even in ethics, lies the true centre of all human and angelic life. With this all things are possible.","The Christians say that God has done miracles. The modern world, even when it believes in God, and even when it has see the defenselessness of nature, does not. It thinks God would not do that sort of thing.","For the past twenty years you and I have been fed all day long on good solid lies about sex","The Christian \\"doctrines\\" are translations into our concepts and ideas of that which God has already expressed in language more adequate, namely the actual incarnation, crucifixion, and resurrection","The hard sayings of our Lord are wholesome to those only who find them hard.","He wondered how he could ever have thought of the planets, even of the Earth, as islands of life and reality floating in a deadly void. Now with a certainty which never after deserted him, he saw the planets - as mere holes or gaps in the living heaven - excluded and rejected wastes of heavy matter and murky air, formed not by addition to, but by subtraction from, the surrounding brightness.","I wish we didn\'t live in a world where buying and selling things seems to have become almost more important than either producing or using them.","Other than heaven, the only place where one\'s heart is completely safe from the dangers of love is hell.","Love, while always forgiving of imperfections and mistakes, can never cease to will their removal.","In any fairly large and talkative community such as a university there is always the danger that those who think alike should gravitate together where they will henceforth encounter opposition only in the emasculated form of rumour that the outsiders say thus and thus. The absent are easily refuted, complacent dogmatism thrives, and differences of opinion are embittered by the group hostility. Each group hears not the best, but the worst, that the other group can say.","If these holy places, things, and days cease to remind us, if they obliterate our awareness that all ground is holy and every bush (could we but perceive it) a Burning Bush, then the hallows begin to do harm. Hence both the necessity, and the perennial danger, of \'religion.\'","If one is only to talk from first-hand experience, conversation would be a very poor business.","Art can teach without at all ceasing to be art.","Every age has its own outlook. It is specially good at seeing certain truths and specially liable to make certain mistakes. We all, therefore, need the books that will correct the characteristic mistake of our own period. And that means the old books.","The purpose of all opprobrious language is, not to describe, but to hurt - even when, like Hamlet, we make only the shadow-passes of a soliloquised combat. We call the enemy not what we think he is but what we think he would least like to be called.","When we force a boy to be a mediocrity in a dozen subjects we destroy his standards, perhaps for life.","In a word, we may reasonably hope for the virtual abolition of education when I\'m as good as you has fully had its way. All incentives to learn and all penalties for not learning will vanish.The few who might want to learn will be prevented; who are they to overtop their fellows? And anyway the teachers-or should I say, nurses?-will be far too busy reassuring the dunces and patting them on the back to waste any time on real teaching. We shall no longer have to plan and toil to spread imperturable conceit and incurable ignorance among men. The little vermin themselves will do it for us.","Men propound mathematical theorems in besieged cities, conduct metaphysical arguments in condemned cells, make jokes on the scaffold, discuss a new poem while advancing to the walls of Quebec, and comb their hair at Thermopylae. This is not panache; it is our nature.","I enjoyed my breakfast this morning, and I think that was a good thing and do not think it was condemned by God. But I do not think myself a good man for enjoying it.","Temperance referred not abstaining, but going the right length and no further...of course it may be the duty of a particular Christian, or any Christian, at a particular time, to abstain from strong drink, either because he is the sort of man who cannot drink at all without drinking too much, or because he wants to give the money to the poor, or because he is with people who are inclined to drunkenness and must not encourage them by drinking himself. But the whole point he is abstaining, for a good reason, from something he does not condemn and which he likes to see other people enjoying.","A Christian is not someone who never goes wrong, but one who is enabled to repent and pick himself up and begin again, because the Christ-life is inside him.","He came to this world and became a man in order to spread to other men the kind of Life He has - by what I call \'good infection\'. Every Christian is to become a little Christ. The whole purpose of becoming a Christian is simply nothing else.","We long for more and God\'s promise is that there is more awaiting us. More to delight us than we will ever exhaust.","If you haven\'t met Satan recently, you are probably going his way!","A man who first tried to guess \'what the public wants,\' and then preached that as Christianity because the public wants it, would be a pretty mixture of fool and knave","We all appear as dunces when feigning an interest in things we care nothing about.","Autumn is really the best of the seasons","Why should your heart not dance?","Pain plants the flag of truth within a rebel fortress.","Every day in a life fills the whole life with expectations and memory.","All I am in private life is a literary critic and historian, that\'s my job...And I\'m prepared to say on that basis if anyone thinks the Gospels are either legends or novels, then that person is simply showing his incompetence as a literary critic. I\'ve read a great many novels and I know a fair amount about the legends that grew up among early people, and I know perfectly well the Gospels are not that kind of stuff.","The real job of every moral teacher is to keep bringing us back to the simple principles, which we\'re so anxious not to see.","Human culture has always had to exist under the shadow of something infinitely more important than itself. If men had postponed the search for knowledge and beauty until they were secure, the search would never have begun.","We have not long to live in any event. Let us spend what is left in seeking the unpeopled world behind the sunrise.","I have read the Aeneid through more often than I have read any long poem.","And this is the marvel of marvels; that he called me Beloved.","If the parents in each generation always or often knew what really goes on at their sons\' schools, the history of education would be very different.","The more imagination the reader has ... the more he will do for himself. He will, at a mere hint from the author, flood wretched material with suggestion and never guess that he is himself chiefly making what he enjoys.","The very idea of freedom presupposes some objective moral law which overarches rulers and ruled alike. Subjectivism about moral values is eternally incompatible with democracy. We and our rulers are of one kind only so long as we are subject to one law. But if there is no Law of Nature, the ethos of any society is the creation of its rulers, educators and conditioners; and every creator stands above and outside his own creation.","[Something] does not rise to the dignity of error.","Christianity thinks of human individuals not as mere members of a group or items in a list, but as organs in a body-different from one another and each contributing what no other could.","God sometimes seems to speak to us most intimately when he catches us, as it were, off our guard.","You people have no imagination!","It is a dreadful truth that the state of having to depend solely on God is what we all dread most.... It is good of Him to force us; but dear me, how hard to feel that it is good at the time.","What one must not do is to rule out the supernatural as the one impossible explanation.","Friendship is born at that moment when a single particular person claims to a different: \'What! You far too? I assumed I was the only real one particular.","It is often little things that are hardest to stand.","An obligation to feel can freeze feelings.","I fancy that most people who think at all have done a great deal of their thinking in the first fourteen years.","Never exaggerate. Never say more than you really mean.","The imagined beings have their insides on the outside; they are visible souls. And man as a whole, Man pitted against the universe, have we seen him at all till we see that he is like a hero in a fairy tale?","To interest is the first duty of art; no other excellences will ever begin to compensate for failure in this.","But however happy you are feeling, you can\'t talk with your mouth full of snow.","Agnostics talk cheerfully of man\'s search for God but they might as well talk about the mouse\'s search for the cat.","When Catholicism goes bad it becomes the religion of amulets and holy places and priestcraft: Protestantism, in its corresponding decay, becomes a vague mist of ethical platitudes","First be sure that you know exactly what you want to say.  Then be sure you have said exactly that.","Let there be wicked kings and beheadings, battles and dungeons, giants and dragons, and let the villans be soundly killed at the end of the book. I think it is possible that by confining your child to the blameless stories of life in which nothing at all alarming ever happens, you would fail to banish the terrors, and would succeed in banishing all that can ennoble them or make them endurable.","The longer we stay in Hell, the more we become attached to it.","Joy bursts in our lives when we go about doing the good at hand and not trying to manipulate things and times to achieve joy.","Christian theology can fit in science, art, morality, and the sub-Christian religious. The scientific point of view cannot fit any of these things, not even science itself.","Narnia! It\'s all in the wardrobe just like I told you!","Nothing is wonderful except in the abnormal, and nothing is abnormal until we have grasped the norm.","He\'s not safe, but he\'s good (referring to Aslan, the Lion, in The Lion, the Witch and the Wardrobe)","Thirst was made for water; inquiry for truth. What you now call the free play of inquiry has neither more nor less to do with the ends for which intelligence was given you than masturbation has to do with marriage.","Be confident small immortals. You are not the only voice that all things utter, nor is there eternal silence in the places where you cannot come.","Why should your majesty think it? My own plans are made. While I may, I sail East in Dawn Treader. When she fails me, I row East in my coracle. When that sinks, shall I paddle East with my four paws. Then, when I can swim no longer, if I have not yet reached Aslan\'s Country, there shall I sink with my nose to the sunrise... and Peepiceek will be head of Talking Mice in Narnia","Once when I had remarked on the affection quite often found between cat and dog, my friend replied, \\"Yes. But I bet no dog would ever confess it to the other dogs.","I was driven to Whipsnade one sunny morning. When we set out I did not believe that Jesus Christ is the son of God, and when we reached the zoo I did. Yet I had not exactly spent the journey in thought. Nor in great emotion. \u201cEmotional\u201d is perhaps the last word we can apply to some of the most important events. It was more like when a man, after a long sleep, still lying motionless in bed, becomes aware that he is now awake.","who can duly adore that Love which will open the high gates to a prodigal who is brought in kicking, struggling, resentful, and darting his eyes in every direction for a chance of escape? The words compelle intrare, compel them to come in, have been so abused by wicked men that we shudder at them; but, properly understood, they plumb the depth of the Divine mercy. The hardness of God is kinder than the softness of man, and His compulsion is our liberation.","the sweet heavy smell grew very much less. For though the whole fire had not been put out, a good bit of it had, and what remained smelled very largely of burnt Marsh-wiggle, which is not at all an enchanting smell.","In Charn [Jadis] had taken no notice of Polly (till the very end) because Digory was the one she wanted to make use of. Now that she had Uncle Andrew, she took no notice of Digory. I expect most witches are like that. They are not interested in things or people unless they can use them; they are terribly practical.","You\'ve no idea how good an old joke sounds when you take it out again after a rest of five or six hundred years.","All is summed up in the prayer which a young female human is said to have uttered recently: \\"O God, make me a normal twentieth-century girl!\\" Thanks to our labors, this will mean increasingly: \\"Make me a minx, a moron, and a parasite.","In the midst of a world of light and love, of song and feast and dance, [Lucifer] could find nothing to think of more interesting than his own prestige.","No time for better words, no time to unsay anything. -Til We Have Faces","you had nothing to say about it and yet made the nothing up into words.","In the name of the Fathers, and of the Son and of the Holy Ghost, here goes-I mean Amen.","A pleasure is full grown only when it is remembered.","Remember, he is not, like you, a pure spirit. Never having been a human (Oh that abominable advantage of the Enemy\'s) you don\'t realize how enslaved they are to the pressure of the ordinary.","It would be nice and fairly nearly true, to say that \'from that time forth, Eustace was a different boy.\' To be strictly accurate, he began to be a different boy. He had relapses. There were still many days when he could be very tiresome. But most of those I shall not notice. The cure had begun.","The time when there is nothing at all in your soul except a cry for help may be just that time when God can\'t give it: you are like the drowning man who can\'t be helped because he clutches and grabs. Perhaps your own reiterated cries deafen you to the voice you hoped to hear.","Do I think well of myself, think myself a nice chap? WEll, I am afraid I sometimes do (and those are, no doubt, my worst moments).","When you are happy, so happy you have no sense of needing Him, so happy that you are tempted to feel His claims upon you as an interruption, if you remember yourself and turn to Him with gratitude and praise, you will be \u2014 or so it feels\u2014 welcomed with open arms. But go to Him when your need is desperate, when all other help is vain, and what do you find? A door slammed in your face, and a sound of bolting and double bolting on the inside. After that, silence.","I now see that I spent most of my life in doing neither what I ought nor what I liked.","In your world, I have another name. You should know me by it.","But length of days with an evil heart is only length of misery and already she begins to know it. All get what they want; they do not always like it.","If one has to choose between reading the new books and reading the old, one must choose the old: not because they are necessarily better but because they contain precisely those truths of which our own age is neglectful.","Being nice doesn\u2019t make you stupid. It makes you feel good because you know you are gracious enough to forgive and smart enough to realize how distasteful some people can be.","They were really getting quite fond of their strange pet and hoped that Aslan would allow them to keep it. The cleverer ones were quite sure by now that at least some of the noises which came out of his mouth had a meaning. They christened him Brandy because he made that noise so often.","God has no needs. Human love, as Plato teaches us, is the child of Poverty \u2013 of want or lack; it is caused by a real or supposed goal in its beloved which the lover needs and desires. But God\'s love, far from being caused by goodness in the object, causes all the goodness which the object has, loving it first into existence, and then into real, though derivative, lovability. God is Goodness. He can give good, but cannot need or get it. In that sense , His love is, as it were, bottomlessly selfless by very definition; it has everything to give, and nothing to receive.","The human mind is generally far more eager to praise and dispraise than to describe and define. It wants to make every distinction a distinction of value; hence those fatal critics who can never point out the differing quality of two poets without putting them in an order of preference as if they were candidates for a prize.","Nature does not teach. A true philosophy may sometimes validate an experience of nature; an experience of nature cannot validate a philosophy. Nature will not verify any theological or metaphysical proposition (or not in the manner we are now considering); she will help to show what it means.","The value of the myth is that it takes all the things we know and restores to them the rich significance which has been hidden by \u2018the veil of familiarity.\u2019 The child enjoys his cold meat, otherwise dull to him, by pretending it is buffalo, just killed with his own bow and arrow. And the child is wise. The real meat comes back to him more savory for having been dipped in a story\u2026by putting bread, gold, horse, apple, or the very roads into a myth, we do not retreat from reality: we rediscover it.","And what about you? You must be some kind of beardless dwarf?...You mean to say, that you\'re a daughter of Eve?...Y-yes, but, you are in fact... human?","This is where men, even the trustiest, fail us. Their heart is never so wholly given to any matter but that some trifle of a meal, or a drink, or a sleep, or a joke, or a girl, may come in between them and it, and then (even if you are a queen) you\'ll get no more good out of them until they\'ve had their way.","All right, beautiful. You\'ve got me tied down to this stone table, and there\'s a knife in your hand that says you get to rule Narnia for another hundred years. So maybe I die, and winter goes on. Maybe the hunger and the darkness and the fear never end. But as long as the children believe in me, I know that Aslan will live again. I, the Great Lion, Son of The Emperor Over The Sea, will live again and -- aaaaauugh!!","No one can say \'He jests at scars who never felt a wound\' for I have never for one moment been in a state of mind to which even the imagination of serious pain was less than intolerable. If any man is safe from the danger of under-estimating this adversary, I am that man.","It\'s so large\\" \\"It\'s the world dear, did you think it\'d be small?\\" \\"smaller","What does seem to me poisonous, what breeds a type of patriotism that is pernicious if it lasts but not likely to last long in an educated adult, is the perfectly serious indoctrination of the young in knowably false or biased history - the heroic legend drably disguised as text-book fact. With this creeps in the tacit assumption that other nations have not equally their heroes; perhaps even the belief - surely it is very bad biology - that we can literally \'inherit\' tradition.","Any patch of sunlight in a wood will show you something about the sun which you could never get from reading books on astronomy. These pure and spontaneous pleasures are \u2018patches of Godlight\u2019 in the woods of our experience.","You weren\'t a decent man and you didn\'t do your best. We none of us were and none of us did.","There is something in natural affection which will lead it on to eternal love more easily than natural appetite could be led on. But there\'s also something in it which makes it easier to stop at the natural level and mistake it for the heavenly. Brass is mistaken for gold more easily than clay is. And if it finally refuses conversion its corruption will be worse than the corruption of what ye call the lower passions. It is a stronger angel, and therefor, when it falls, a fiercer devil.","Pity was meant to be a spur that drives joy to help misery. But it can be used the wrong way round. It can be used for a kind of blackmailing. Those who choose misery can hold joy up to ransom, by pity.","Very few modern people think Friendship a love of comparable value or even a love at all.","I can promise you none of these things. No sphere of usefulness; you are not needed there at all. No scope of your talents; only forgiveness for having perverted them. No atmosphere of inquiry, for I will bring you to the land not of questions but of answers, and you shall see the face of God. (pg 40)","You can do more with a castle in a story than with the best cardboard castle that ever stood on a nursery table.","When the most important things in our life happen we quite often do not know, at the moment, what is going on. A man does not always say to himself, \\"hullo! i\'m growing up.\\" It is only when he looks back that he realises what has happened and recognises it as what people call \\"growing up.","He\'s wild, you know. Not like a tame lion.","All mortals tend to turn into the thing they are pretending to be. This is elementary","For Narnia and for Aslan!","In my experience, it is Affection that creates this taste, teaching us first to notice, then to endure, then to smile at, then to enjoy, and finally to appreciate the people who \'happen to be there.\' Made for us? Thank God, no. They are themselves, odder than you could have believed and worth far more than we guessed.","Even if there were pains in Heaven, all who understand would desire them.","I have at last come to the end of the Faerie Queene: and though I say \\"at last\\", I almost wish he had lived to write six books more as he had hoped to do \u2014 so much have I enjoyed it.","Enough had been thought, and said, and felt, and imagined. It was about time that something should be done.","Courtship is the time for sowing those seeds which will grow up ten years into domestic hatred.","Cobbles and kettledrums! ...I hope this madness isn\'t going to end in a moonlit climb and broken necks.","and the whole forest would give itself up to jollification for weeks on end.","I see you are an idiot, whatever else you may be.","His face had become very red and his mouth and fingers were sticky. He did not look either clever or handsome, whatever the Queen might say.","Edmund, who was becoming a nastier person every minute, thought that he had scored a great success, and went on at once to say, \'There she goes again. What\'s the matter with her?","This was bad grammar of course, but that is how beavers talk when they are excited; I mean, in Narnia--in our world they usually don\'t talk at all. - The Lion, The Witch, and the Wardrobe","It was a full moon and, shining on all the snow, it made everything almost as bright as day -- only the shadows were rather confusing.","Giant Wimbleweather burst into one of those not very intelligent laughs to which the nicer sort of Giants are so liable. He checked himself at once and looked as grace as a turnip by the time Reepicheep discovered where the noise came from.","Hail Lord, ...Loose my chains.","Am I to understand,\' said Reepicheep to Lucy after a long stare at Eustace, \'That this singularly discourteous person is under your Majesty\'s protection? Because, if not--","We thought the Duke would have been pleased if the King\'s Majesty would have married his daughter, but nothing came of that--\' Squints, and has freckles,\' said Caspian. Oh, poor girl,\' said Lucy.","Golly,\' said Edmund under his breath, \'He\'s a retired star.","Oh, Lor!\' said the boy, sitting down on the grassy bank at the edge of the shrubbery and very quickly getting up again because the grass was soaking wet. His name was unfortunately Eustace Scrubb but he wasn\'t a bad sort.","If you thirst you may drink.","And as Jill gazed at its motionless bulk, she realized that she might as well have asked the whole mountain to move aside for her convenience.","I\'m a beast, I am, and a Badger what\'s more. We don\'t change. We hold on.","They stormed and jeered at one another in long meaningless words of about twenty syllables each.","And there\'s one thing about this underground work, we shan\'t get any rain.","Yes, I know,\' interrupted Puddleglum. \'And few return to the sunlit lands. You needn\'t say it again. You are a chap of one idea, aren\'t you?","You see, Aslan didn\'t tell Pole what would happen. He only told her what to do. That fellow will be the death of us once he\'s up, I shouldn\'t wonder. But that doesn\'t let us off following the signs. - The Silver Chair","Here. All of you. And you, doorkeeper. No one is to be let out of the house today. And anyone I catch talking about this young lady will be first beaten to death and then burned alive and after that be kept on bread and water for six weeks. There.","But as long as you know you\'re nobody special, you\'ll be a very decent sort of Horse, on the whole, and taking one thing with another.","\u201cWho are you?\u201d One who has waited long for you to speak.","And I was the Lion you do not remember who pushed the boat in which you lay, a child near death, so that it came to shore where a man sat, wakeful at midnight, to receive you.","Please,\' she said, \'You\'re so beautiful. You may eat me if you like. I\'d rather be eaten by you than fed by anyone else.","Father! Can I box him? Please!","The bolt of Tash falls from above!\' \'Does it ever get caught on a hook halfway?","By gum,\' said Digory, \'Don\'t I just wish I was big enough to punch your head!","All names will soon be restored to their proper owners.","Well, sir, if things are real, they\u2019re there all the time.\\" \\"Are they?\\" said the Professor; and Peter did not quite know what to say.","Though it was bright sunshine everyone felt suddenly cold. The only two people present who seemed to be quite at their ease were Aslan and the Witch herself. It was the oddest thing to see those two faces - the golden face and the dead-white face so close together. Not that the Witch looked Aslan exactly in his eyes; Mrs Beaver particularly noticed this.","Last year, when he had been staying with the Pevensies, he had managed to hear them all talking of Narnia and he loved teasing them about it. He thought of course that they were making it all up; and as he was far too stupid to make anything up himself, he did not approve of that.","Pooh! Grown-ups are always thinking of uninteresting explanations.","Redeemed humanity is still young, it has hardly come to its full strength. But already there is joy enough in the little finger of a great saint such as yonder lady to waken all the dead things of the universe into life.","There is nothing indulgent about the Moral Law. It is as hard as nails. It tells you to do the straight thing and it does not seem to care how painful, or dangerous, or difficult it is to do.","Digory never spoke on the way back, and the others were shy of speaking to him. He was very sad and he wasn\'t even sure all the time that he had done the right thing; but whenever he remembered the shining tears in Aslan\'s eyes he became sure.","Sleeping on a dragon\'s hoard with greedy, dragonish thoughts in his heart, he had become a dragon himself.","Nothing is very strong: strong enough to steal away a man\'s best years not in sweet sins but in a dreary flickering of the mind over it knows not what and knows not why, in the gratification of curiosities so feeble that the man is only half aware of them, in drumming of fingers and kicking of heels, in whistling tunes that he does not like, or in the long, dim labyrinth of reveries that have not even lust or ambition to give them a relish, but which, once chance association has started them, the creature is took weak and fuddled to shake off.","The man who truly and disinterestedly enjoys any one thing in the world, for its own sake, and without caring two-pence what other people say about it, is by that very fact forewarmed against some of our subtlest modes of attack.","By this method thousands of humans have been brought to think that humility means pretty women trying to believe they are ugly and clever men trying to believe they are fools. And since what they are trying to believe may, in some cases, be manifest nonsense, they cannot succeed in believing it and we have the chance of keeping their minds endlessly revolving on themselves in an effort to achieve the the impossible.","The Enemy wants to bring the man to a state of mind in which he could design the best cathedral in the world, and know it to be the best, and rejoice in the fact, without being any more (or less) or otherwise glad at having done it than he would be if it had been done by another. The Enemy wants him, in the end, to be so free from any bias in his own favour that he can rejoice in his own talents as frankly and gratefully as in his neighbour\'s talents--or in a sunrise, an elephant, or a waterfall.","You must therefore zealously guard in his mind the curious assumption \'My time is my own\'. Let him have the feeling that he starts each day as the lawful possessor of twenty-four hours. Let him feel as a grievous tax that portion of this property which he has to make over to him employers, and as a generous donation that further portion which h allows to religious duties. But what he must never be permitted to doubt is that the total from which these deductions have been made was, in some mysterious sense, his own personal birthright.","The game is to have them all running about with fire extinguishers when there is a flood, and all crowding to that side of the boat which is already nearly gunwale under.","The longest way round is the shortest way home. (Quoting Alexander MacLaren, The Wearied Christ and Other Sermons)","I wonder do the gods know what it feels like to be a man.","Edmund, give a special goodbye to Trumpkin for me. He\'s been a brick.","Always winter but never Christmas.","But what manner of use would it be ploughing through that darkness?\' asked Drinian. Use?\' replied Reepicheep. \'Use, Captain?\' If you mean by filling our bellies or our purses, I confess it will be no use at all. So far as I know we did not set sail to look for things useful but to seek honour and adventures. And here is as great an adventure as I have ever heard of, and here, if we turn back, no little impeachment of all our honours.","Provided that any of those neighbours sing out of tune or have boots that squeak, or double chins, or odd clothes, the patient will quite easily believe that their religion must therefore be somehow ridiculous.","If each side had been frankly contending for its own real wish, they would all have kept within the bounds of reason and courtesy; but just because the contention is reversed and each side is fighting the other side\u2019s battle, all the bitterness which really flows from thwarted self-righteousness and obstinacy and from the accumulated grudges of the last ten years is concealed from them by the nominal or official \\"Unselfishness\\" of what they are doing or, at least, held to be excused by it.","For jokes as well as justice come in with speech.","She remembered, as every sensible person does, that you should never never shut yourself up in a wardrobe.","I was wondering \u2014 I mean \u2014 could there be some mistake? Because nobody called me and Scrubb, you know. It was we who asked to come here. You would not have called me unless I had been calling you.","It is because they have no Oyarsa,\' said one of the pupils. It is because everyone of them wants to be a little Oyarsa himself,\' said Augray.","At a well in a yard they met a man who was beating a boy. The stick burst into a flower in the mans hand. He tried to drop it, but it stuck to his hand. His arm became a branch, his body the trunk of a tree, his feet took root.","It is in some ways more troublesome to track and swat an evasive wasp than to shoot, at close range, a wild elephant. But the elephant is more troublesome if you miss.","Strictly speaking, there are no such things as good and bad impulses. Think...of a piano. It has not got two kinds of notes on it, the \'right\' notes and the \'wrong\' ones. Every single note is right at one time and wrong at another. The Moral Law is not any one instinct or set of instincts: it is something which makes a kind of tune (the tune we call goodness or right conduct) by directing the instincts.","Few men looked on her without becoming, in a certain fashion, her lovers. But it was the kind of love that made them not less true, but truer, to their own wives.","God made us: invented us as a man invents an engine. A car is made to run on petrol, and it would not run properly on anything else. Now God designed the human machine to run on Himself. He Himself is the fuel our spirits were designed to burn, or the food our spirits were designed to feed on. There is no other. That is why it is just no good asking God to make us happy in our own way without bothering about religion. God cannot give us a happiness and peace apart from Himself, because it is not there.","A Centaur has a man-stomach and a horse-stomach. And of course both want breakfast. So first of all he has porridge and pavenders and kidneys and bacon and omlette and cold ham and toast and marmalade and coffee and beer. And after that he tends to the horse part of himself by grazing for an hour or so and finishing up with a hot mash, some oats, and a bag of sugar. That\'s why it\'s such a serious thing to ask a Centaur to stay for the weeekend. A very serious thing indeed.","I don\'t want him to live forever, and I know that he\'s not going to live forever whether I want him to or not.","To every man, in his acquaintance with a new art, there comes a moment when that which before was meaningless first lifts, as it were, one corner of the curtain that hides its mystery, and reveals, in a burst of delight which later and fuller understanding can hardly ever equal, one glimpse of the indefinite possibilities within.","A Christian society is not going to arrive until most of us really want it: and we are not going to want it until we become fully Christian. I may repeat \\"Do as you would be done by\\" till I am black in the fact, but I cannot really carry it out till I love my neighbour as myself: and I cannot learn to love my neighbour as myself till I learn to love God.","Our struggle is--isn\'t it?--to achieve and retain faith on a lower level. To believe that there is a Listener at all. For as the situation grows more and more desperate, the grisly fears intrude. Are we only talking to ourselves in an empty universe? The silence is often so emphatic. And we have prayed so much already","I hope I do not offend God by making my Communions in the frame of mind I have been describing. The command, after all, was Take, eat: not Take, understand.","Remember, we Christians think man lives for ever. Therefore, what really matters is those little marks or twists on the central, inside part of the soul which are going to turn it, in the long run, into a heavenly or a hellish creature.","We delight to praise what we enjoy because the praise not merely expresses but completes the enjoyment; it is its appointed consummation. It is not out of compliment that lovers keep on telling one another how beautiful they are; the delight is incomplete till it is expressed.","You ask whether I have ever been in love: fool as I am, I am not such a fool as that. But if one is only to talk from first-hand experience, conversation would be a very poor business. But though I have no personal experience of the things they call love, I have what is better - the experience of Sappho, of Euripides, of Catallus, of Shakespeare, of Spenser, of Austen, of Bronte, of anyone else I have read.","Most of us know what we should expect to find in a dragon\'s lair, but, as I said before, Eustace had read only the wrong books. They had a lot to say about exports and imports and governments and drains, but they were weak on dragons.","They were pretty tired by now of course; but not what I\u2019d call bitterly tired \u2013 only slow and feeling very dreamy and tired as one does when one is coming to the end of a long day in the open.","And in truth (as I now see) I had the wish to put off my journey as long as I could. Not for any peril or labour it might cost; but because I could see nothing in the whole world for me to do once it was accomplished. AS long as this act lay before me, there was, as it were, some barrier between me and the dead desert which the rest of my life must be.","The distinction between pretending you are better than you are and beginning to be better in reality is finer than moral sleuth hounds conceive.","Humour is...the all-consoling and...the all-excusing, grace of life.","Do you mean to say,\\" asked Caspian, \\"that you three come from a round world (round like a ball) and you\'ve never told me! It\'s really too bad for you. Because we have fairy-tales in which there are round worlds and I have always loved them \u2026 Have you ever been to the parts where people walk about upside-down?\\" Edmund shook his head. \\"And it isn\'t like that,\\" he added. \\"There\'s nothing particularly exciting about a round world when you\'re there.","Am I lost or just less found?","The false religion of lust is baser than the false religion of mother-love or patriotism or art: but lust is less likely to be made into a religion.","Did I hate him, then? Indeed, I believe so. A love like that can grow to be nine-tenths hatred and still call itself love.","Daughter of Eve from the far land of Spare Oom where eternal summer reigns around the bright city of War Drobe, how would it be if you came and had tea with me?","A perfect man would never act from a sense of duty; he\u2019d always want the right thing more than the wrong one. Duty is only a substitute for love (of God and of other people) like a crutch which is a substitute for a leg. Most of us need the crutch at times; but of course it is idiotic to use the crutch when our own legs (our own loves, tastes, habits etc.) can do the journey on their own.","Human beings, all over the earth, have this curious idea that they ought to believe in a certain way, and can\'t really get rid of it.","Though no one would want to be sold as a slave, it is perhaps even more galling to be a sort of utility slave whom no one will buy.","What can you ever really know of other people\'s souls \u2014 of their temptations, their opportunities, their struggles? One soul in the whole of creation you do know: and it is the only one whose fate is placed in your hands. If there is a God, you are, in a sense, alone with Him.","For every one pupil who needs to be guarded against a weak excess of sensibility there are three who need to be awakened from the slumber of cold vulgarity. The task of the modern educator is not to cut down jungles but to irrigate deserts.","I thought I could describe a state; make a map of sorrow. Sorrow, hoever, turns out to be not a state but a process.","Wouldn\'t he know without being asked?\' said Polly. \'I\'ve no doubt he would,\' said the Horse (still with his mouth full). \'But I\'ve a sort of an idea he likes to be asked.","Emeth came walking forward into the open strip of grass between the bonfire and the Stable. His eyes were shining, his face was solemn, his hand was on his sword-hilt, and he carried his head high. Jill felt like crying when she looked at his face. And Jewel whispered in the King\'s ear, \\"By the Lion\'s Mane, I almost love this young warrior, Calormene though he be. He is worthy of a better god than Tash.","If my house has collapsed at one blow, that is because it was a house of cards. The faith which \'took these things into account\' was not faith but imagination.","When the author walks onto the stage, the play is over","A world of automata \u2013 of creatures that worked like machines \u2013 would hardly be worth creating.","You would not call a man humane for ceasing to set mousetraps if he did so because he believed there were no mice in the house.","But how can the characters in a play guess the plot? We are not the playwright, we are not the producer, we are not even the audience. We are on the stage. To play well the scenes in which we are \\"on\\" concerns us much more than to guess about the scenes that follow it.","Peter, High King of Narnia,\\" said Aslan. \\"Shut the Door.","I have swallowed up girls and boys, women and men, kings and emperors, cities and realms,\\" said the Lion. It didn\'t say this as if it were boasting, nor as if it were sorry, nor as if it were angry. It just said it.","Emerson said, Do you love me? means Do you see the same truth?-Or at least, \\"Do you care about the same truth?","Sometimes it is hard not to say, \'God forgive God.\' Sometimes it is hard to say so much. But if our faith is true, He didn\'t. He crucified Him.","The claim to equality, outside of the strictly political field, is made only by those who feel themselves to be in some way inferior.","Devils are depicted with bats\' wings and good angels with birds\' wings, not because anyone holds that moral deterioration would be likely to turn feathers into membrane, but because most men like birds better than bats.","They Open A Door And Enter A World","We were promised sufferings. They were part of the program. We were even told, Blessed are they that morn.","It is only when you are asked to believe in Reason coming from non-reason that you must cry Halt. Human minds. They do not come from nowhere.","Though I do not believe that my desire for Paradise proves that I shall enjoy it, I think it a pretty good indication that such a thing exists and that some men will.","You cannot study Pleasure in the moment of the nuptial embrace, nor repentance while repenting, nor analyze the nature of humour while roaring with laughter.","There are no variations except for those who know a norm, and no subtleties for those who have not grasped the obvious.","Joy is the serious business of heaven. Our merriment must be between people who take each other seriously.","The best fruits are plucked for each by some hand that is not his own.","One is sometimes glad not to be a great theologian; one might easily mistake it for being a good Christian.","But as for Aslan himself, the Beavers and the children didn\'t know what to do or say when they saw him. People who have not been in Narnia sometimes think that a thing cannot be good and terrible at the same time. If the children had ever thought so, they were cured of it now. For when they tried to look at Aslan\'s face they just caught a glimpse of the golden mane and the great, royal, solemn, overwhelming eyes; and then they found they couldn\'t look at him and went all trembly.","At the very least, they can be persuaded that the bodily position makes no difference to their prayers; for they constantly forget[...]that they are animals and that whatever their bodies do affects their souls.","Be good, sweet maid, and don\'t forget that this involves being as clever as you can.","I believe that if a million chances were likely to do good, they would be given.","I do not doubt that if the Paradisal man could now appear among us, we should regard him as an utter savage, a creature to be exploited or, at best, patronised. Only one or two, and those the holiest among us, would glance a second time at the naked, shaggy-bearded, slow spoken creature: but they, after a few minutes, would fall at his feet.","I believe Buddhism to be a simplification of Hinduism and Islam to be a simplification of Xianity.","The return from the walk, and the arrival of tea, should be exactly coincident, and not later than a quarter past four.","For He (God) seems to do nothing of himself which He can possibly delegate to His creatures.","A faith in culture is as bad as a faith in religion; both expressions imply a turning away from those very things which culture and religion are about. Culture as a collective name for certain very valuable activities is a permissible word; but culture hypostatized, set up on its own, made into a faith, a cause, a banner, a platform, is unendurable. For none of the activities in question cares a straw for that faith or cause. It is like a return to early Semitic religion where names themselves were regarded as powers.","If we are any good we must always be working towards the moment at which our Pupils are fit to become our Critics & Rivals","When an artist is in the strict sense working, he of course takes into account the existing tastes, interests and capacity of his audience. These no less than the language , the marble, the paint, are part of his aw material.; to be used, tamed, sublimated, not ignored or defied. Haughty indifference to them is not genius, it is laziness and incompetence.","Don\'t worry. If you really want to, you will Whether you\'ll like it when you do is another question.","Could one start a Stagnation Party-which at General Elections would boast that during its term of office no event of the least importance had taken place?","Those who have nothing can share nothing; those who are going nowhere can have no fellow-travellers.","The central Christian belief is that Christ\'s death has somehow put us right with God and given us a fresh start. Theories as to how it did this are another matter. A good many different theories have been held as to how it works; what all Christians are agreed on is that it does work.","We may be sure that the characteristic blindness of the twentieth century [...] lies where we have never suspected it [...] The only palliative is [...] by reading old books. [...] the books of the future would be just as good [...], but unfortunately we cannot get at them.","But probably every age gets, within certain limits, the science it deserves.","Which of the religions of the world gives to its followers the greatest happiness? While it lasts, the religion of worshiping oneself is best.","Imagine a set of people all living in the same building. Half of them think it is a hotel, the other half think it is a prison. Those who think it a hotel might regard it as quite intolerable, and those who thought it was a prison might decide that it was really surprisingly comfortable. So that what seems the ugly doctrine is one that comforts and strengthens you in the end. The people who try to hold an optimistic view of this world would become pessimists: the people who hold a pretty stern view of it become optimistic.","We reduce things to mere Nature in order that we may \\"conquer\\" them.","The Old Testament contains fabulous elements. The New Testament consists mostly of teaching, not of narrative at all: but where it is narrative, it is, in my opinion, historical. As to the fabulous element in the Old Testament, I very much doubt if you would be wise to chuck it out.","If you make the same guess often enough it ceases to be a guess and becomes a Scientific Fact. This is the inductive method.","The heart of Christianity is a myth which is also a fact.","This was the very reason why you were brought to Narnia, that by knowing me here for a little, you may know me better there.","The whole difficulty of understanding Hell is that the thing to be understood is so nearly nothing.","All Hell is smaller than one pebble of your earthly world; but it is smaller than one atom of this world, the Real World.","Heaven will display far more variety than Hell.","Everywhere, except in theology, there has been a vigorous growth of skepticism about skepticism itself.","When you go to church you are really listening in to the secret wireless from our friends.","A society where the simple many obey the few seers can live; a society where all were seers could live even more fully. But a society where the mass is still simple and the seers are no longer attended to can achieve only superficiality, baseness, ugliness, and in the end extinction. On or back we must go: to stay here is death.","The real Oxford is a close corporation of jolly, untidy, lazy, good-for-nothing humorous old men, who have been electing their own successors ever since the world began and who intend to go on with it. They\'ll squeeze under the Revolution or leap over it when the time comes, don\'t you worry.","We can never know that a piece of writing is bad unless we have begun by trying to read it as if it was very good and ended by discovering that we were paying the author an undeserved compliment.","Ye cannot know eternal reality by a definition. Time itself, and all the acts and events that fill time are the definition, and it must be lived.","Post-Christian man is not the same as Pre-Christian man. He is as far removed as virgin is from widow: there is nothing in common except want of a spouse: but there is a great difference between a spouse-to-be and a spouse lost.","Most of us need the crutch at times; but of course it is idiotic to use the crutch when our own legs (our own loves, tastes, habits etc.) can do the journey on their own.","Kids like us don\'t often have the chance of meeting a great warrior like you. Would you have a little fencing match with me? It would be frightfully decent.","She looked at a silver birch: it would have a soft, showery voice and would look like a slender girl, with hair blown all about her face and fond of dancing. She looked at the oak: he would be a wizened, but hearty, old man with a frizzled beard and warts on his fact and hands, with hair growing out of the warts. She looked at the beech under which she was standing. Ah! --she would be the best of all. She would be a gracious goddess, smooth and stately, the Lady of the Wood.","Oh Trees, Trees, Trees...wake. Don\'t you remember it? Don\'t you remember me? Dryads and hamadryads, come out, come [out] to me.","Feeling like the voice she liked best in all the world was calling her name.","She stepped out from among their shifting confusion of lovely lights and shadows. A circle of grass, smooth as a lawn, met her eyes, with dark trees dancing all around it. And then --Oh Joy! For he was there: the huge Lion, shining white in the moonlight, with his huge black shadow underneath him.","Certainly, Lu. Whatever you like,\' said Peter unexpectedly. This was encouraging, but as Peter instantly rolled round and went to sleep again it wasn\'t much use.","The mouse is a fair treat but this one would talk the hind legs off a donkey.","And the Prince stared at her like a man out of his wits.","No more I do, your Majesty. But what\'s that got to do with it? I might as well die on a wild goose chase as die here.","Humility, after the first shock, is cheerful virtue.","A noble hunger, long unsatisfied, met at last its proper food.","You know what this is, I suppose. Religious melancholia. Stop while there is time. If you dive, you dive into insanity.","As long as this deliberate refusal to understand things from above, even where such understanding is possible, continues, it is idle to talk of any final victory over materialism.","No Christian and, indeed, no historian could accept the epigram which defines religion as \'what a man does with his solitude.\'","Reasoning is never, like poetry, judged from the outside at all.","Disobedience to conscience is voluntary; bad poetry, on the other hand, is usually not made on purpose.","Every poem can be considered in two ways--as what the poet has to say, and as a thing which he makes.","Only the skilled can judge the skillfulness, but that is not the same as judging the value of the result.","Without sin, the universe is a Solemn Game: and there is no good game without rules.","Everything except God has some natural superior; everything except unformed matter has some natural inferior.","People blush at praise--not only praise of their bodies, but praise of anything that is theirs.","To fight in another man\'s armour is something more than to be influenced by his style of fighting.","If we did not bring to the examinations of our instincts a knowledge of their comparative dignity we could never learn it from them.","Man\'s conquest of Nature turns out, in the moment of its consummation, to be Nature\'s conquest of Man.","If the universe is so bad...how on earth did human beings ever come to attribute it to the activity of a wise and good Creator?","If we will not learn to eat the only food that the universe grows...then we must starve eternally.","The \'frankness\' of people sunk below shame is a very cheap frankness.","Those who would like the God of scripture to be more purely ethical, do not know what they ask.","If God were a Kantian, who would not have us till we came to Him from the purest and best motives, who could be saved?","Tribulations cannot cease until God either sees us remade or sees that our remaking is now hopeless.","An Ulster Scot may come to disbelieve in God, but not to wear his weekday clothes on the Sabbath.","War creates no absolutely new situation: it simply aggravates the permanent human situation so that we can no longer ignore it. Human life has always been lived on the edge of a precipice.","The Christians who did most for the present world were precisely those who thought most of the next.","Sometimes fairy stories may say best what\'s to be said.","Nonsense remains nonsense even when we talk it about God.","Reality, in fact, is always something you couldn\'t have guessed. That\'s one of the reasons I believe Christianity. It\'s a religion you couldn\'t have guessed.","Do you not know how bashful friendship is? Friends - comrades - do not look at each other. Friendship would be ashamed.","We do know that no person can be saved except through Christ. We do not know that only those who know Him can be saved by Him.","I believe that many who find that \\"nothing happens\\" when they sit down, or kneel down, to a book of devotion, would find that the heart sings unbidden while they are working their way through a tough bit of theology with a pipe in their teeth and a pencil in their hand.","Aslan\\" said Lucy \\"you\'re bigger\\". \\"That is because you are older, little one\\" answered he. \\"Not because you are?\\" \\"I am not. But every year you grow, you will find me bigger\\".","Will the others see you too?\\" asked Lucy. \\"Certainly not at first,\\" said Aslan. \\"Later on, it depends.\\" \\"But they won\u2019t believe me!\\" said Lucy. \\"It doesn\u2019t matter.","No man who says, \'I\'m as good as you,\' believes it. He would not say it if he did.","At home, besides being Peter or Jane, we also bear a general character; husband or wife, brother or sister, chief, colleague or subordinate. Not among Friends. It is an affair of disentangled, or stripped, minds. Eros will have naked bodies; Friendship naked personalities.","But what would have been the good?\\" Aslan said nothing. \\"You mean,\\" said Lucy rather faintly, \\"that it would have turned out all right \u2013 somehow? But how? Please, Aslan! Am I not to know?\\" \\"To know what would have happened, child?\\" said Aslan. \\"No. Nobody is ever told that.\\" \\"Oh dear,\\" said Lucy. \\"But anyone can find out what will happen,\\" said Aslan. \\"If you go back to the others now, and wake them up; and tell them you have seen me again; and that you must all get up at once and follow me \u2013 what will happen? There is only one way of finding out.","Every joy is beyond all others.","Oh God, God, why did you take such trouble to force this creature out of its shell if it is now doomed to crawl back -- to be sucked back -- into it?","Every good book should be entertaining. A good book will be more; it must not be less. Entertainment\u2026is like a qualifying examination. If a fiction can\u2019t provide that, we may be excused from inquiring into its higher qualities.","Will you come with me to the mountains? It will hurt at first, until your feet are hardened. Reality is harsh to the feet of shadows. But will you come?","All day I have been tossed and whirled in a preposterous happiness; was it an elf in the blood? Or a bird in the brain? Or even part of the cloudily crested, fifty-league-long, loud, uplifted wave of a journeying angels transit over and through my heart?","[the difference between the old and the new education being] in a word, the old was a kind of propagation-men transmitting manhood to men; the new is merely propaganda.","But I remember more dearly autumn afternoons in bottoms that lay intensely silent under old great trees","There is no good trying to be more spiritual than God. God never meant man to purely spiritual creature. That is why He uses material things like bread and wine to put the new life into us. We may think this rather crude and unspiritual. God does not: He invented eating. He likes matter. He invented it.","The Eternal Being, who knows everything and who created the whole universe, became not only a man but (before that) a baby, and before that a fetus in a woman\'s body.","The hills and valleys of Heaven will be to those you now experience not as a copy is to an original, nor as the substitute is to the genuine article, but as the flower to the root, or the diamond to the coal.","When we are such as He can love without impediment, we shall in fact be happy.","And now, what does it all matter? It matters more than anything else in the world. The whole dance, or drama, or pattern of this three-Personal life is to be played out in each one of us: or (putting it the other way round) each one of us has got to enter that pattern, take his place in that dance. There is no other way to the happiness for which we were made.","Wherever any precept of traditional morality is simply challenged to produce its credentials, as though the burden of proof lay on it, we have taken the wrong position.","Morality or duty never yet made a man happy in himself or dear to others.","There is nothing indulgent about the Moral Law. It is as hard as nails. If God is like the Moral Law, then He is not soft.","Morality, like numinous awe, is a jump; in it, man goes beyond anything that can be \'given\' in the facts of experience.","All men alike stand condemned, not by alien codes of ethics, but by their own, and all men therefore are conscious of guilt.","One can regard the moral law as an illusion, and so cut himself off from the common ground of humanity.","The standard that measures two things is something different from either. You are, in fact, comparing them both with some Real Morality, admitting that there is such a thing as a real Right, independent of what people think, and that some people\'s ideas get nearer to that real Right than others.","The value given to the testimony of any feeling must depend on our whole philosophy, not our whole philosophy on a feeling.","If, as I can\'t help suspecting, the dead also feel the pains of separation (and this may be one of their purgatorial sufferings), then for both lovers, and for all pairs of lovers without exception, bereavement is a universal and integral part of our experience of love.","Each new power won by man is a power over man as well. Each advance leaves him weaker as well as stronger.","Whenever you find a man who says he does not believe in a real Right and Wrong, you will find the same man going back on this a moment later. He may break his promise to you, but if you try breaking one to him he will be complaining \'It\'s not fair\' before you can say Jack Robinson.","The great thing is to be found at one\'s post as a child of God, living each day as though it were our last, but planning as though the world might last a hundred years.","The true enjoyments must be spontaneous and compulsive and look to no remoter end.","We have had enough, once and for all, of Hedonism--the gloomy philosophy which says that Pleasure is the only good.","Poetry too is a little incarnation, giving body to what had been before invisible and inaudible.","The difference [God\'s] timelessness makes is that this now (which slips away from you even as you say the word now) is for Him infinite.","Though we cannot experience our life as an endless present, we are eternal in God\'s eyes; that is, in our deepest reality.","Only He who really lived a human life (and I presume that only one did) can fully taste the horror of death.","Some people probably think of the Resurrection as a desperate last moment expedient to save the Hero from a situation which had got out of the Author\'s control.","To play well the scenes in which we are \'on\' concerns us much more than to guess about the scenes that follow it.","Every sin is the distortion of an energy breathed into us.","You must not do, you must not even try to do, the will of the Father unless you are prepared to \'know of the doctrine\'.","We poison the wine as He decants it into us; murder a melody He would play with us as the instrument...Hence all sin, whatever else it is, is sacrilege.","The natural life in each of us is something self-centred, something that wants to be petted and admired, to take advantage of other lives, to exploit the whole universe.","The dangers of apparent self-sufficiency explain why Our Lord regards the vices of the feckless and dissipated so much more leniently than the vices that lead to worldly success.","A blessed spirit is a mould ever more and more patient of the bright metal poured into it, a body ever more completely uncovered to the meridian blaze of the spiritual sun.","In coming to understand anything we are rejecting the facts as they are for us in favour of the facts as they are.","Why you fool, it\'s the educated reader who can be gulled.  All our difficulty comes with the others.  When did you meet a workman who believes the papers?  He takes it for granted that they\'re all propaganda and skips the leading articles....He\'s our problem.  We have to recondition him.  But the educated public, the people who read the high-brow weeklies, don\'t need reconditioning.  They\'re all right already.  They\'ll believe anything.","Surely arrested development consists not in refusing to lose old things but in failing to add new things.","Whenever a person dwells chiefly, or even frequently, on the faults of other people\'s religions, he is in a bad condition.","When the most important things in our life happen we\\n quite often do not know, at the moment, what is\\n going on.","Because, as we know, almost anything can be read into any book if you are determined enough. This will be especially impressed on anyone who has written fantastic fiction. He will find reviewers, both favourable and hostile, reading into his stories all manner of allegorical meanings which he never intended. (Some of the allegories thus imposed on my own books have been so ingenious and interesting that I often wish I had thought of them myself.)","When Catholicism goes bad it becomes the world-old, world-wide religio of amulets and holy places and priestcraft. Protestantism,in its corresponding decay, becomes a vague mist of ethical platitudes. Catholicism is accused of being too much like all the other religions; Protestantism of being insufficiently like a religion at all. Hence Plato, with his transcendent Forms, is the doctor of Protestants; Aristotle, with his immanent Forms, the doctor of Catholics.","Actually it seems to me that one can hardly say anything either bad enough or good enough about life.","The story itself should force its moral upon you. You find out what the moral is by writing the story.","A God. The God. One word can make all the difference in the world.","Term, holidays, term, holidays, till we leave school, and then work, work, work till we die.","The only safe rule is to give more than we can spare.  Our charities should pinch and hamper us.  If we live at the same level of affluence as other people who have our level of income, we are probably giving away too little.","Anyone who endeavors to be a Christian will soon find his intelligence being sharpened. You are embarking on something that is going to take the whole of you, brains and all.","Humans are very seldom either totally sincere or totally hypocritical. Their moods change, their motives are mixed, and they are often quite mistaken as to what their motives are.","A spoiled saint, a Pharisee, an inquisitor, or a magician, makes better sport to Hell than a mere common tyrant or debauchee.","But if we admit God, must we admit Miracle? Indeed, indeed, you have no security against it. That is the bargain. Theology says to you in effect, \'Admit God and with Him the risk of a few miracles, and I in return will ratify your faith in uniformity as regards the overwhelming majority of events.","Catch {a man} at the moment when he is really poor in spirit and smuggle into his mind the gratifying reflection, \\"By jove, I\'m being humble,\\" and almost immediately pride - pride at his own humility - will appear.","To see, in some measure, like God. His love and His knowledge are not distinct from one another, not from Him. We could almost say He sees because He loves, and therefore loves although He sees.","We have not, in fact, proved that science excludes miracles: we have only proved that the question of miracles, like innumerable other questions, excludes laboratory treatment.","I read in a periodical the other day that the fundamental thing is how we think of God. By God Himself, it is not! How God thinks of us is not only more important, but infinitely more important.","Grief is like a bomber circling round and dropping its bombs each time the circle brings it overhead; physical pain is like the steady barrage on a trench in World War One, hours if it with no let-up for a moment. Thought is never static pain often is... is it not yet enough?","[Milton\'s] argument is (a) St. Augustine was wrong in thinking God\'s only purpose in giving Adam a female, instead of a male, companion, was copulation. For (b) there is a \\"peculiar comfort\\" in the society of man and woman \\"beside, (i.e. in addition to, apart from) the genial bed\\"; and (c) we know from Scripture that something analogous to \\"play\\" or \\"slackening the cords\\" occurs even in God. That is why the Song of Songs describes a thousand raptures...far on the hither side of carnal enjoyment.","Friendship is the greatest of worldly goods. Certainly to me it is the chief happiness of life.","Many thousands of people have had the experience of finding the first friend, and it is none the less a wonder; as great a wonder (pace the novelists) as first love, or even greater.","To get even near humility, even for a moment, is like a drink of cold water to a man in a desert.","He produced mainly three results: Hatred, Terror, Adoration.","Perfect goodness can never debate about the end to be attained, and perfect wisdom cannot debate about the means most suited to achieve it.","Meaningless combinations of words do not suddenly acquire meaning simply because we prefix to them the two other words \' God can\'.","Fine feelings, new insights, greater interest in \u02bfreligion\u02be mean nothing unless they make our actual behavior better.","Because God created the Natural - invented it out of His love and artistry - it demands our reverence.","Every poet and musician and artist, but for grace\\">Grace, is drawn away from love of the thing he tells to love of the telling till, down in Deep Hell, they cannot be interested in God at all but only in what they say about Him.","In order that we finite beings may apprehend the Emporer He translates His glory into multiple forms - into stars, woods, waters, beasts, and the bodies of men.","Here, I think, lies our real dilemma. Probably we cannot, certainly we shall not, retrace our steps. We are tamed animals (some with kind, some with cruel, masters) and should probably starve if we got out of our cage. That is one horn of the dilemma. But in an increasingly planned society, how much of what I value can survive? That is the other horn.","Bad art is never really enjoyed in the same sense in which good art is enjoyed. It is only \\"liked\\": it never startles, prostrates, and takes captive.","The story does what no theorem can quite do. It may not be \\"like real life\\" in the superficial sense: but it sets before us an image of what reality may well be like at some more central region.","Even the best Christian that ever lived is not acting on his own steam--he is only nourishing or protecting a life he could never have acquired by his own efforts.","The Christian view is that men were created to be in a certain relationship to God (if we are in that relation to Him, the right relation to one another will follow inevitably).","Time is the very lens through which ye see - small and clear, as men see through the wrong end of a telescope - something that would otherwise be too big for ye to see at all. That thing is Freedom: the gift whereby ye most resemble your Maker and are yourselves parts of eternal reality.","If you find that the reader of popular romances--however uneducated a reader, however bad the romances--goes back to his old favourites again and again, then you have pretty good evidence that they are to him a sort of poetry.","Hell is a state of mind -- ye never said a truer word. And every state of mind, left to itself, every shutting up of the creature within the dungeon of its own mind -- is, in the end, Hell. But Heaven is not a state of mind. Heaven is reality itself. All that is fully real is Heavenly.","Prayer is either a sheer illusion or a personal contact between embryonic, incomplete persons (ourselves) and the utterly concrete Person.","A sensible human once said, \\"If people knew how much ill-feeling unselfishness occasions, it would not be so often recommended from the pulpit\\"; and again, \\"She\'s the sort of woman who lives for others you can always tell the others by their hunted expression.","I would say if a man is going to write on chemistry, he learns chemistry. The same is true of Christianity. But to speak of the craft itself, I would not know how to advise a man how to write. It is a matter of talent and interest. I believe he must be strongly moved if he is to become a writer. Writing is like a \'lust,\' or like \'scratching when you itch.\' Writing comes as a result of a very strong impulse, and when it does come, I for one must get it out.","A work of (whatever) art can be either \'received\' or \'used\'. ...\'Using\' is inferior to \'reception\' because art, if used rather than received, merely facilitates, brightens, relieves or palliates our life, and does not add to it ... When the art in question is literature a complication arises, for to \'receive\' significant words is always, in one sense, to \'use\' them, to go through and beyond them to an imagined something which is not itself verbal.","A particular ikon an aid to devotion may be itself a word of art, but that is logically accidental; its artistic merits will not make it a better ... ikon. They may make it a worse one.","\'Being in love\' first moved them to promise fidelity: this quieter love enables them to keep the promise.","The door on which we have been knocking all our lives will open at last.","Christianity has not message for those who do not realize they are sinners.","You\'re a mere chick. I remember you when you were a egg. Don\'t come trying to teach me, sir. Crabs and crumpets!","Puddleglum,\' they\'ve said, \'You\'re altogether too full of bobance and bounce and high spirits. You\'ve got to learn that life isn\'t all fricasseed frogs and ell pie. You want something to sober you down a bit. We\'re only saying it for your own good, Puddleglum.\' That\'s what they say. Now a job like this --a journey up north just as winter\'s beginning looking for a prince that probably isn\'t there, by way of ruined city nobody\'s ever seen-- will be just the thing. If that doesn\'t steady a chap, I don\'t know what will.","I have seen something like it happen in battle. A man was coming at me, I at him, to kill. Then came a sudden great gust of wind that wrapped out cloaks over our swords and almost over our eyes, so that we could do nothing to one another but must fight the wind itself. And that ridiculous contention, so foreign to the business we were on, set us both laughing, face to face - friends for a moment - and then at once enemies again and forever.","I don\'t want to hold you hand!","When I\'m older I\'ll understand\\" said Lucy, \\" I am older and I don\'t think I want to understand\\", replied Edmund","Got to start by finding it, have we? Can\'t start by looking for it, I suppose?","The most intense joy, lies not in the having, but in the desire, Delight that never fades, bliss that is eternal, Is only your, when what you most desire, is just out of reach...Anthony Hopkins, from the movie Shadowlands, where he plays C.S. Lewis","We must meet children as equals in that area of our nature where we are their equals...The child as reader is neither to be patronized nor idolized: we talk to him as man to man.","[The witch] would have known that when a willing victim who had committed no treachery was killed in a traitor\u2019s stead, the Table would crack and Death itself would start working backwards.","That world is ended, as if it had never been. Let the race of Adam and Eve take warning.","You know me better than you think, you know, and you shall know me better yet.","Though under earth, and throneless now I be Yet while I lived all earth was under me.","But all night, Aslan and the Moon gazed upon each other with joyful and unblinking eyes.","Jewel,\' he said, \'what lies before us? Horrible thoughts arise in my heart. If we had died before today we should have been happy.","Would it not be better to be dead than to have this horrible fear that Aslan has come and is not like the Aslan we have believed in and longed for? It is as if the sun rose one day and were a black sun.","More like the real thing,\' said the lord Digory softly. - The Last Battle","I object to that remark very strongly! - The Magician\'s Nephew","But he always licked to get visitors alone in the billiard room and tell them stories about a mysterious lady, a foreign royalty, with whom he had driven about London. \'A devilish temper she had,\' he would say. \'But she was a dem fine woman, sir, a dem fine woman.","Now sir, said the bulldog in his business-like way. \'Are you a animal, vegetable, or mineral?\' - The Magician\'s Nephew","Think of a country where people were admired for running away in battle, or where a man felt proud of double-crossing all the people who had been kindest to him. You might just as well try to imagine a country where two and two made five.","We must perpetually try to distinguish, however closely they get entwined by the subtle nature of the facts and by the secret importunity of our passions, those attitudes in a writer which we can honestly and confidently condemn as real evils, and those qualities in his writing which simply annoy and offend us as men of taste.","I have seen landscapes . . . which, under a particular light, make me feel that at any moment a giant might raise his head over the next ridge.","I felt in my bones that this universe does not explain itself.","Watchin\' and listenin\' is the thing at present; not talking.","The Christian claim is: Nothing explains the facts better than an all-powerful, all-knowing, omnipresent god creating the universe and sending Jesus to spread his message. This is about as remarkable a claim as could be stated, and yet it is tossed out lightly. Christians seem to imagine that \\"God did it\\" is as plausible as the natural explanation that stories grow with the retelling. The Christian has the burden of proof, and it\'s an enormous burden given this enormous claim.","If a man is going to write on chemistry, he learns chemistry. The same is true of Christianity.","The most deeply compelled action is also the freest action. By that I mean, no part of you is outside the action.","A great deal of what is being published by writers in the religious tradition is a scandal and is actually turning people away from the church. The liberal writers who are continually accommodating and whittling down the truth of the Gospel are responsible.","You can\'t lay down any pattern for God. There are many different ways of bringing people into his Kingdom, even some ways that I specially dislike! I have therefore learned to be cautious in my judgment.","I cannot speak for the way God deals with others; I only know how he deals with me personally.","I would not know how to advise a man how to write. It is a matter of talent and interest. I believe he must be strongly moved if he is to become a writer.","Before God closed in on me, I was offered what now appears a moment of wholly free choice. But I feel my decision was not so important. I was the object rather than the subject in this affair.","Of course, we are to pray for spiritual awakening, and in various ways we can do something toward it. But we must remember that neither Paul nor Apollos gives the increase.","Some people write heavily, some write lightly. I prefer the light approach because I believe there is a great deal of false reverence about. There is too much solemnity and intensity in dealing with sacred matters; too much speaking in holy tones.","There is a difference between a private devotional life and a corporate one. Solemnity is proper in church, but things that are proper in church are not necessarily proper outside, and vice versa.","I can say a prayer while washing my teeth, but that does not mean I should wash my teeth in church.","Friendship ... is born at the moment when one man says to another \\"What! You too? I thought that no one but myself . . .","You can never get a cup of tea large enough or a book long enough to suit me.","If we find ourselves with a desire that nothing in this world can satisfy, the most probable explanation is that we were made for another world.","Friendship is unnecessary, like philosophy, like art.... It has no survival value; rather it is one of those things which give value to survival.","Imagine yourself as a living house. God comes in to rebuild that house. At first, perhaps, you can understand what He is doing. He is getting the drains right and stopping the leaks in the roof and so on; you knew that those jobs needed doing and so you are not surprised. But presently He starts knocking the house about in a way that hurts abominably and does not seem to make any sense. What on earth is He up to? The explanation is that He is building quite a different house from the one you thought of - throwing out a new wing here, putting on an extra floor there, running up towers, making courtyards. You thought you were being made into a decent little cottage: but He is building a palace. He intends to come and live in it Himself.","A man can no more diminish God\'s glory by refusing to worship Him than a lunatic can put out the sun by scribbling the word \'darkness\' on the walls of his cell.","I am trying here to prevent anyone saying the really foolish thing that people often say about Him: I\u2019m ready to accept Jesus as a great moral teacher, but I don\u2019t accept his claim to be God. That is the one thing we must not say. A man who was merely a man and said the sort of things Jesus said would not be a great moral teacher. He would either be a lunatic \u2014 on the level with the man who says he is a poached egg \u2014 or else he would be the Devil of Hell. You must make your choice. Either this man was, and is, the Son of God, or else a madman or something worse. You can shut him up for a fool, you can spit at him and kill him as a demon or you can fall at his feet and call him Lord and God, but let us not come with any patronizing nonsense about his being a great human teacher. He has not left that open to us. He did not intend to.","Atheism turns out to be too simple. If the whole universe has no meaning, we should never have found out that it has no meaning...","God can\'t give us peace and happiness apart from Himself because there is no such thing.","Mental pain is less dramatic than physical pain, but it is more common and also more hard to bear. The frequent attempt to conceal mental pain increases the burden: it is easier to say \u201cMy tooth is aching than to say \u201cMy heart is broken.\u201d","Courage, dear heart.","Critics who treat \'adult\' as a term of approval, instead of as a merely descriptive term, cannot be adult themselves. To be concerned about being grown up, to admire the grown up because it is grown up, to blush at the suspicion of being childish; these things are the marks of childhood and adolescence. And in childhood and adolescence they are, in moderation, healthy symptoms. Young things ought to want to grow. But to carry on into middle life or even into early manhood this concern about being adult is a mark of really arrested development. When I was ten, I read fairy tales in secret and would have been ashamed if I had been found doing so. Now that I am fifty I read them openly. When I became a man I put away childish things, including the fear of childishness and the desire to be very grown up.","To have Faith in Christ means, of course, trying to do all that He says. There would be no sense in saying you trusted a person if you would not take his advice. Thus if you have really handed yourself over to Him, it must follow that you are trying to obey Him. But trying in a new way, a less worried way. Not doing these things in order to be saved, but because He has begun to save you already. Not hoping to get to Heaven as a reward for your actions, but inevitably wanting to act in a certain way because a first faint gleam of Heaven is already inside you.","In friendship...we think we have chosen our peers. In reality a few years\' difference in the dates of our births, a few more miles between certain houses, the choice of one university instead of another...the accident of a topic being raised or not raised at a first meeting--any of these chances might have kept us apart. But, for a Christian, there are, strictly speaking no chances. A secret master of ceremonies has been at work. Christ, who said to the disciples, \\"Ye have not chosen me, but I have chosen you,\\" can truly say to every group of Christian friends, \\"Ye have not chosen one another but I have chosen you for one another.\\" The friendship is not a reward for our discriminating and good taste in finding one another out. It is the instrument by which God reveals to each of us the beauties of others.","I have come home at last! This is my real country! I belong here. This is the land I have been looking for all my life, though I never knew it till now...Come further up, come further in!","If I find in myself desires which nothing in this world can satisfy, the only logical explanation is that I was made for another world.","The future is something which everyone reaches at the rate of sixty minutes an hour, whatever he does, whoever he is.","Give me all of you!!! I don\u2019t want so much of your time, so much of your talents and money, and so much of your work. I want YOU!!! ALL OF YOU!! I have not come to torment or frustrate the natural man or woman, but to KILL IT! No half measures will do. I don\u2019t want to only prune a branch here and a branch there; rather I want the whole tree out! Hand it over to me, the whole outfit, all of your desires, all of your wants and wishes and dreams. Turn them ALL over to me, give yourself to me and I will make of you a new self---in my image. Give me yourself and in exchange I will give you Myself. My will, shall become your will. My heart, shall become your heart.","As long as you are proud you cannot know God. A proud man is always looking down on thing and people: and, of course, as long as you are looking down you cannot see something that is above you.","Nothing you have not given away will ever really be yours.","Safe? said Mr. Beaver; \u201cdon\u2019t you hear what Mrs. Beaver tells you? Who said anything about safe? \u2018Course he isn\u2019t safe. But he\u2019s good. He\u2019s the King, I tell you.\u201d","Indeed the safest road to Hell is the gradual one--the gentle slope, soft underfoot, without sudden turnings, without milestones, without signposts,...Your affectionate uncle, Screwtape.","Christianity, if false, is of no importance, and if true, of infinite importance, the only thing it cannot be is moderately important.","I am a product [...of] endless books. My father bought all the books he read and never got rid of any of them. There were books in the study, books in the drawing room, books in the cloakroom, books (two deep) in the great bookcase on the landing, books in a bedroom, books piled as high as my shoulder in the cistern attic, books of all kinds reflecting every transient stage of my parents\' interest, books readable and unreadable, books suitable for a child and books most emphatically not. Nothing was forbidden me. In the seemingly endless rainy afternoons I took volume after volume from the shelves. I had always the same certainty of finding a book that was new to me as a man who walks into a field has of finding a new blade of grass.","When the two people who thus discover that they are on the same secret road are of different sexes, the friendship which arises between them will very easily pass \u2013 may pass in the first half hour \u2013 into erotic love. Indeed, unless they are physically repulsive to each other or unless one or both already loves elsewhere, it is almost certain to do so sooner or later. And conversely, erotic love may lead to Friendship between the lovers. But this, so far from obliterating the distinction between the two loves, puts it in a clearer light. If one who was first, in the deep and full sense, your Friend, is then gradually or suddenly revealed as also your lover you will certainly not want to share the Beloved\u2019s erotic love with any third. But you will have no jealousy at all about sharing the Friendship. Nothing so enriches an erotic love as the discovery that the Beloved can deeply, truly and spontaneously enter into Friendship with the Friends you already had; to feel that not only are we two united by erotic love but we three or four or five are all travelers on the same quest, have all a common vision.","Make your choice, adventurous Stranger,Strike the bell and bide the danger,Or wonder, till it drives you mad,What would have followed if you had.","One word, Ma\'am,\\" he said, coming back from the fire; limping, because of the pain. \\"One word. All you\'ve been saying is quite right, I shouldn\'t wonder. I\'m a chap who always liked to know the worst and then put the best face I can on it. So I won\'t deny any of what you said. But there\'s one more thing to be said, even so. Suppose we have only dreamed, or made up, all those things-trees and grass and sun and moon and stars and Aslan himself. Suppose we have. Then all I can say is that, in that case, the made-up things seem a good deal more important than the real ones. Suppose this black pit of a kingdom of yours is the only world. Well, it strikes me as a pretty poor one. And that\'s a funny thing, when you come to think of it. We\'re just babies making up a game, if you\'re right. But four babies playing a game can make a play-world which licks your real world hollow. That\'s why I\'m going to stand by the play world. I\'m on Aslan\'s side even if there isn\'t any Aslan to lead it. I\'m going to live as like a Narnian as I can even if there isn\'t any Narnia. So, thanking you kindly for our supper, if these two gentlemen and the young lady are ready, we\'re leaving your court at once and setting out in the dark to spend our lives looking for Overland. Not that our lives will be very long, I should think; but that\'s a small loss if the world\'s as dull a place as you say.","Courage is not simply one of the virtues but the form of every virtue at the testing point, which means at the point of highest reality.","Your real, new self (which is Christ\'s and also yours, and yours just because it is His) will not come as long as you are looking for it. It will come when you are looking for Him. Does that sound strange? The same principle holds, you know, for more everyday matters. Even in social life, you will never make a good impression on other people until you stop thinking about what sort of impression you are making. Even in literature and art, no man who bothers about originality will ever be original whereas if you simply try to tell the truth (without caring twopence how often it has been told before) you will, nine times out of ten, become original without ever having noticed it. The principle runs through all life from top to bottom, Give up yourself, and you will find your real self. Lose your life and you will save it. Submit to death, death of your ambitions and favourite wishes every day and death of your whole body in the end submit with every fibre of your being, and you will find eternal life. Keep back nothing. Nothing that you have not given away will be really yours. Nothing in you that has not died will ever be raised from the dead. Look for yourself, and you will find in the long run only hatred, loneliness, despair, rage, ruin, and decay. But look for Christ and you will find Him, and with Him everything else thrown in.","No one ever told me that grief felt so like fear. I am not afraid, but the sensation is like being afraid. The same fluttering in the stomach, the same restlessness, the yawning. I keep on swallowing.At other times it feels like being mildly drunk, or concussed. There is a sort of invisible blanket between the world and me. I find it hard to take in what anyone says. Or perhaps, hard to want to take it in. It is so uninteresting. Yet I want the others to be about me. I dread the moments when the house is empty. If only they would talk to one another and not to me.","You may have noticed that the books you really love are bound together by a secret thread. You know very well what is the common quality that makes you love them, though you cannot put it into words: but most of your friends do not see it at all, and often wonder why, liking this, you should also like that. Again, you have stood before some landscape, which seems to embody what you have been looking for all your life; and then turned to the friend at your side who appears to be seeing what you saw -- but at the first words a gulf yawns between you, and you realise that this landscape means something totally different to him, that he is pursuing an alien vision and cares nothing for the ineffable suggestion by which you are transported. Even in your hobbies, has there not always been some secret attraction which the others are curiously ignorant of -- something, not to be identified with, but always on the verge of breaking through, the smell of cut wood in the workshop or the clap-clap of water against the boat\'s side? Are not all lifelong friendships born at the moment when at last you meet another human being who has some inkling (but faint and uncertain even in the best) of that something which you were born desiring, and which, beneath the flux of other desires and in all the momentary silences between the louder passions, night and day, year by year, from childhood to old age, you are looking for, watching for, listening for? You have never had it. All the things that have ever deeply possessed your soul have been but hints of it -- tantalising glimpses, promises never quite fulfilled, echoes that died away just as they caught your ear. But if it should really become manifest -- if there ever came an echo that did not die away but swelled into the sound itself -- you would know it. Beyond all possibility of doubt you would say \\"Here at last is the thing I was made for\\". We cannot tell each other about it. It is the secret signature of each soul, the incommunicable and unappeasable want, the thing we desired before we met our wives or made our friends or chose our work, and which we shall still desire on our deathbeds, when the mind no longer knows wife or friend or work. While we are, this is. If we lose this, we lose all.","Once a King in Narnia, always a King in Narnia. But don\'t go trying to use the same route twice. Indeed, don\'t try to get there at all. It\'ll happen when you\'re not looking for it. And don\'t talk too much about it even among yourselves. And don\'t mention it to anyone else unless you find that they\'ve had adventures of the same sort themselves. What\'s that? How will you know? Oh, you\'ll know all right. Odd things, they say-even their looks-will let the secret out. Keep your eyes open. Bless me, what do they teach them at these schools.\\"-The Professor","Of all tyrannies, a tyranny sincerely exercised for the good of its victims may be the most oppressive. It would be better to live under robber barons than under omnipotent moral busybodies. The robber baron\'s cruelty may sometimes sleep, his cupidity may at some point be satiated; but those who torment us for our own good will torment us without end for they do so with the approval of their own conscience. They may be more likely to go to Heaven yet at the same time likelier to make a Hell of earth. This very kindness stings with intolerable insult. To be \\"cured\\" against one\'s will and cured of states which we may not regard as disease is to be put on a level of those who have not yet reached the age of reason or those who never will; to be classed with infants, imbeciles, and domestic animals.","We can ignore even pleasure. But pain insists upon being attended to. God whispers to us in our pleasures, speaks in our conscience, but shouts in our pains: it is his megaphone to rouse a deaf world.","Progress means getting nearer to the place you want to be. And if you have taken a wrong turn, then to go forward does not get you any nearer.If you are on the wrong road, progress means doing an about-turn and walking back to the right road; and in that case the man who turns back soonest is the most progressive man.","One day, you will be old enough to start reading fairytales again.","Everyone thinks forgiveness is a lovely idea until he has something to forgive.","And as He spoke, He no longer looked to them like a lion; but the things that began to happen after that were so great and beautiful that I cannot write them. And for us this the end of all the stories, and we can most truly say that they all lived happily ever after. But for them it was only the beginning of the real story. All their life in this world and all their adventures in Narnia had only been the cover and the title page: now at last they were beginning Chapter One of the Great Story which no one on earth has read: which goes on for ever: in which every chapter is better than the one before.","For in grief nothing \\"stays put.\\" One keeps on emerging from a phase, but it always recurs. Round and round. Everything repeats. Am I going in circles, or dare I hope I am on a spiral?But if a spiral, am I going up or down it?How often -- will it be for always? -- how often will the vast emptiness astonish me like a complete novelty and make me say, \\"I never realized my loss till this moment\\"? The same leg is cut off time after time.","Reality, in fact, is usually something you could not have guessed. That is one of the reasons I believe Christianity. It is a religion you could not have guessed. If it offered us just the kind of universe we had always expected, I should feel we were making it up. But, in fact, it is not the sort of thing anyone would have made up. It has just that queer twist about it that real things have. So let us leave behind all these boys\' philosophies--these over simple answers. The problem is not simple and the answer is not going to be simple either.","It is a serious thing to live in a society of possible gods and goddesses, to remember that the dullest most uninteresting person you can talk to may one day be a creature which,if you saw it now, you would be strongly tempted to worship, or else a horror and a corruption such as you now meet, if at all, only in a nightmare. All day long we are, in some degree helping each other to one or the other of these destinations. It is in the light of these overwhelming possibilities, it is with the awe and the circumspection proper to them, that we should conduct all of our dealings with one another, all friendships, all loves, all play, all politics. There are no ordinary people. You have never talked to a mere mortal. Nations, cultures, arts, civilizations - these are mortal, and their life is to ours as the life of a gnat. But it is immortals whom we joke with, work with, marry, snub, and exploit - immortal horrors or everlasting splendors.","To the glistening eastern sea, I give you Queen Lucy the Valiant. To the great western woods, King Edmund the Just. To the radiant southern sun, Queen Susan the Gentle. And to the clear northern skies, I give you King Peter the Magnificent. Once a king or queen of Narnia, always a king or queen of Narnia. May your wisdom grace us until the stars rain down from the heavens.","Wrong will be right, when Aslan comes in sight,At the sound of his roar, sorrows will be no more,When he bares his teeth, winter meets its death,And when he shakes his mane, we shall have spring again.","The mold in which a key is made would be a strange thing, if you had never seen a key: and the key itself a strange thing if you had never seen a lock. Your soul has a curious shape because it is a hollow made to fit a particular swelling in the infinite contours of the divine substance, or a key to unlock one of the doors in the house with many mansions.Your place in heaven will seem to be made for you and you alone, because you were made for it -- made for it stitch by stitch as a glove is made for a hand.","God will not be used as a convenience. Men or nations who think they can revive the Faith in order to make a good society might just as well think they can use the stairs of heaven as a shortcut to the nearest chemist\'s shop.","It may be hard for an egg to turn into a bird: it would be a jolly sight harder for a bird to learn to fly while remaining an egg. We are like eggs at present. And you cannot go on indefinitely being just an ordinary, decent egg. We must be hatched or go bad.","Aim at Heaven and you will get Earth \'thrown in\': aim at Earth and you will get neither.","I am [in your world].\u2019 said Aslan. \u2018But there I have another name. You must learn to know me by that name. This was the very reason why you were brought to Narnia, that by knowing me here for a little, you may know me better there.","In our world,\\" said Eustace, \\"a star is a huge ball of flaming gas.\\"Even in your world, my son, that is not what a star is, but only what it is made of.","The Christian says, \'Creatures are not born with desires unless satisfaction for those desires exists. A baby feels hunger: well, there is such a thing as food. A duckling wants to swim: well, there is such a thing as water. Men feel sexual desire: well, there is such a thing as sex. If I find in myself a desire which no experience in this world can satisfy, the most probable explanation is that I was made for another world. If none of my earthly pleasures satisfy it, that does not prove that the universe is a fraud. Probably earthly pleasures were never meant to satisfy it, but only to arouse it, to suggest the real thing. If that is so, I must take care, on the one hand, never to despise, or to be unthankful for, these earthly blessings, and on the other, never to mistake them for the something else of which they are only a kind of copy, or echo, or mirage. I must keep alive in myself the desire for my true country, which I shall not find till after death; I must never let it get snowed under or turned aside; I must make it the main object of life to press on to that country and to help others to do the same.","Knowledge can last, principles can last, habits can last; but feelings come and go... But, of course, ceasing to be \\"in love\\" need not mean ceasing to love. Love in this second sense \u2014 love as distinct from \\"being in love\\" \u2014 is not merely a feeling. It is a deep unity, maintained by the will and deliberately strengthened by habit; reinforced by (in Christian marriage) the grace which both partners ask, and receive, from God... \\"Being in love\\" first moved them to promise fidelity: this quieter love enables them to keep the promise. It is on this love that the engine of marriage is run: being in love was the explosion that started it.","I once read the sentence \'I lay awake all night with a toothache, thinking about the toothache an about lying awake.\' That\'s true to life. Part of every misery is, so to speak, the misery\'s shadow or reflection: the fact that you don\'t merely suffer but have to keep on thinking about the fact that you suffer. I not only live each endless day in grief, but live each day thinking about living each day in grief.","No man knows how bad he is till he has tried very hard to be good. A silly idea is current that good people do not know what temptation means. This is an obvious lie. Only those who try to resist temptation know how strong it is. After all, you find out the strength of the German army by fighting against it, not by giving in. You find out the strength of a wind by trying to walk against it, not by lying down. A man who gives in to temptation after five minutes simply does not know what it would have been like an hour later. That is why bad people, in one sense, know very little about badness \u2014 they have lived a sheltered life by always giving in. We never find out the strength of the evil impulse inside us until we try to fight it: and Christ, because He was the only man who never yielded to temptation, is also the only man who knows to the full what temptation means \u2014 the only complete realist.","I remember Christian teachers telling me long ago that I must hate a bad man\'s actions but not hate the bad man: or, as they would say, hate the sin but not the sinner. ...I used to think this a silly, straw-splitting distinction: how could you hate what a man did and not hate the man? But years later it occurred to me that there was one man to whom I had been doing this all my life -- namely myself. However much I might dislike my own cowardice or conceit or greed, I went on loving myself. There had never been the slightest difficulty about it. In fact the very reason why I hated the things was that I loved the man. Just because I loved myself, I was sorry to find that I was the sort of man who did those things.","But, first, remember, remember, remember the signs. Say them to yourself when you wake in the morning and when you lie down at night, and when you wake in the middle of the night. And whatever strange things may happen to you, let nothing turn your mind from following the signs. And secondly, I give you a warning. Here on the mountain I have spoken to you clearly: I will not often do so down in Narnia. Here on the mountain, the air is clear and your mind is clear; as you drop down into Narnia, the air will thicken. Take great care that it does not confuse your mind. And the signs which you have learned here will not look at all as you expect them to look, when you meet them there. That is why it is so important to know them by heart and pay no attention to appearances. Remember the signs and believe the signs. Nothing else matters.","You never know how much you really believe anything until its truth or falsehood becomes a matter of life and death to you. It is easy to say you believe a rope to be strong and sound as long as you are merely using it to cord a box. But suppose you had to hang by that rope over a precipice. Wouldn\'t you then first discover how much you really trusted it?","Aravis also had many quarrels (and, I\'m afraid even fights) with Cor, but they always made it up again: so that years later, when they were grown up they were so used to quarreling and making it up again that they got married so as to go on doing it more conveniently.","A woman\'s heart should be so close to God that a man should have to chase Him to find her.","In speaking of this desire for our own far off country, which we find in ourselves even now, I feel a certain shyness. I am almost committing an indecency. I am trying to rip open the inconsolable secret in each one of you\u2014the secret which hurts so much that you take your revenge on it by calling it names like Nostalgia and Romanticism and Adolescence; the secret also which pierces with such sweetness that when, in very intimate conversation, the mention of it becomes imminent, we grow awkward and affect to laugh at ourselves; the secret we cannot hide and cannot tell, though we desire to do both. We cannot tell it because it is a desire for something that has never actually appeared in our experience. We cannot hide it because our experience is constantly suggesting it, and we betray ourselves like lovers at the mention of a name. Our commonest expedient is to call it beauty and behave as if that had settled the matter. Wordsworth\u2019s expedient was to identify it with certain moments in his own past. But all this is a cheat. If Wordsworth had gone back to those moments in the past, he would not have found the thing itself, but only the reminder of it; what he remembered would turn out to be itself a remembering. The books or the music in which we thought the beauty was located will betray us if we trust to them; it was not in them, it only came through them, and what came through them was longing. These things\u2014the beauty, the memory of our own past\u2014are good images of what we really desire; but if they are mistaken for the thing itself they turn into dumb idols, breaking the hearts of their worshipers. For they are not the thing itself; they are only the scent of a flower we have not found, the echo of a tune we have not heard, news from a country we have never yet visited.","You are never too old to set another goal, or to dream a new dream.","Those who cannot conceive Friendship as a substantive love but only as a disguise or elaboration of Eros betray the fact that they have never had a Friend. The rest of us know that though we can have erotic love and friendship for the same person yet in some ways nothing is less like a Friendship than a love-affair. Lovers are always talking to one another about their love; Friends hardly ever about their Friendship. Lovers are normally face to face, absorbed in each other; Friends, side by side, absorbed in some common interest. Above all, Eros (while it lasts) is necessarily between two only. But two, far from being the necessary number for Friendship, is not even the best. And the reason for this is important.... In each of my friends there is something that only some other friend can fully bring out. By myself I am not large enough to call the whole man into activity; I want other lights than my own to show all his facets... Hence true Friendship is the least jealous of loves. Two friends delight to be joined by a third, and three by a fourth, if only the newcomer is qualified to become a real friend. They can then say, as the blessed souls say in Dante, \'Here comes one who will augment our loves.\' For in this love \'to divide is not to take away.","If you\'ve been up all night and cried till you have no more tears left in you - you will know that there comes in the end a sort of quietness. You feel as if nothing was ever going to happen again.","I live in the Managerial Age, in a world of \\"Admin.\\" The greatest evil is not now done in those sordid \\"dens of crime\\" that Dickens loved to paint. It is not done even in concentration camps and labour camps. In those we see its final result. But it is conceived and ordered (moved, seconded, carried, and minuted) in clean, carpeted, warmed and well-lighted offices, by quiet men with white collars and cut fingernails and smooth-shaven cheeks who do not need to raise their voices. Hence, naturally enough, my symbol for Hell is something like the bureaucracy of a police state or the office of a thoroughly nasty business concern.\\"[From the Preface]","There is no safe investment. To love at all is to be vulnerable. Love anything, and your heart will certainly be wrung and possibly be broken. If you want to make sure of keeping it intact, you must give your heart to no one, not even to an animal. Wrap it carefully round with hobbies and little luxuries; avoid all entanglements; lock it up safe in the casket or coffin of your selfishness. But in that casket \u2013 safe, dark, motionless, airless \u2013 it will change. It will not be broken; it will become unbreakable, impenetrable, irredeemable. The alternative to tragedy, or at least to the risk of tragedy, is damnation. The only place outside Heaven where you can be perfectly safe from all the dangers and perturbations of love is Hell.","Friendship arises out of mere Companionship when two or more of the companions discover that they have in common some insight or interest or even taste which the others do not share and which, till that moment, each believed to be his own unique treasure (or burden). The typical expression of opening Friendship would be something like, \\"What? You too? I thought I was the only one.\\" ... It is when two such persons discover one another, when, whether with immense difficulties and semi-articulate fumblings or with what would seem to us amazing and elliptical speed, they share their vision - it is then that Friendship is born. And instantly they stand together in an immense solitude.","Son,\'he said,\' ye cannot in your present state understand eternity...That is what mortals misunderstand. They say of some temporal suffering, \\"No future bliss can make up for it,\\" not knowing that Heaven, once attained, will work backwards and turn even that agony into a glory. And of some sinful pleasure they say \\"Let me have but this and I\'ll take the consequences\\": little dreaming how damnation will spread back and back into their past and contaminate the pleasure of the sin. Both processes begin even before death. The good man\'s past begins to change so that his forgiven sins and remembered sorrows take on the quality of Heaven: the bad man\'s past already conforms to his badness and is filled only with dreariness. And that is why...the Blessed will say \\"We have never lived anywhere except in Heaven, : and the Lost, \\"We were always in Hell.\\" And both will speak truly.","Here are beauties which pierce like swords or burn like cold iron. Here is a book which will break your heart.\\" [on Lord of the Rings]","But please, please - won\'t you - can\'t you give me something that will cure Mother?\' Up till then he had been looking at the Lion\'s great feet and the huge claws on them; now, in his despair, he looked up at its face. What he saw surprised him as much as anything in his whole life. For the tawny face was bent down near his own and (wonder of wonders) great shining tears stood in the Lion\'s eyes. They were such big, bright tears compared with Digory\'s own that for a moment he felt as if the Lion must really be sorrier about his Mother than he was himself. \'My son, my son,\' said Aslan. \'I know. Grief is great.","Being in love is a good thing, but it is not the best thing. There are many things below it, but there are also things above it. You cannot make it the basis of a whole life. It is a noble feeling, but it is still a feeling. Now no feeling can be relied on to last in its full intensity, or even to last at all. Knowledge can last, principles can last, habits can last but feelings come and go. And in fact, whatever people say, the state called \u2018being in love\u2019 usually does not last. If the old fairy-tale ending \u2018They lived happily ever after\u2019 is taken to mean \u2018They felt for the next fifty years exactly as they felt the day before they were married,\u2019 then it says what probably never was nor ever would be true, and would be highly undesirable if it were. Who could bear to live in that excitement for even five years? What would become of your work, your appetite, your sleep, your friendships? But, of course, ceasing to be \u2018in love\u2019 need not mean ceasing to love. Love in this second sense \u2014 love as distinct from \u2018being in love\u2019 \u2014 is not merely a feeling. It is a deep unity, maintained by the will and deliberately strengthened by habit; reinforced by (in Christian marriages) the grace which both partners ask, and receive, from God. They can have this love for each other even at those moments when they do not like each other; as you love yourself even when you do not like yourself. They can retain this love even when each would easily, if they allowed themselves, be \u2018in love\u2019 with someone else. \u2018Being in love\u2019 first moved them to promise fidelity: this quieter love enables them to keep the promise. it is on this love that the engine of marriage is run: being in love was the explosion that started it.","Now we cannot...discover our failure to keep God\'s law except by trying our very hardest (and then failing). Unless we really try, whatever we say there will always be at the back of our minds the idea that if we try harder next time we shall succeed in being completely good. Thus, in one sense, the road back to God is a road of moral effort, of trying harder and harder. But in another sense it is not trying that is ever going to bring us home. All this trying leads up to the vital moment at which you turn to God and say, \\"You must do this. I can\'t.","At the end of things, The Blessed will say, \u201cWe have never lived anywhere except in Heaven. And the lost will say, \u201cWe were always in Hell.\u201d And both will speak truly.\u201d","God created things which had free will. That means creatures which can go wrong or right. Some people think they can imagine a creature which was free but had no possibility of going wrong, but I can\'t. If a thing is free to be good it\'s also free to be bad. And free will is what has made evil possible. Why, then, did God give them free will? Because free will, though it makes evil possible, is also the only thing that makes possible any love or goodness or joy worth having. A world of automata -of creatures that worked like machines- would hardly be worth creating. The happiness which God designs for His higher creatures is the happiness of being freely, voluntarily united to Him and to each other in an ecstasy of love and delight compared with which the most rapturous love between a man and a woman on this earth is mere milk and water. And for that they\'ve got to be free.Of course God knew what would happen if they used their freedom the wrong way: apparently, He thought it worth the risk. (...) If God thinks this state of war in the universe a price worth paying for free will -that is, for making a real world in which creatures can do real good or harm and something of real importance can happen, instead of a toy world which only moves when He pulls the strings- then we may take it it is worth paying.","Welcome, Prince,\' said Aslan. \'Do you feel yourself sufficient to take up the Kingship of Narnia?\'I - I don\'t think I do, Sir,\' said Caspian. \'I am only a kid.\'Good,\' said Aslan. \'If you had felt yourself sufficient, it would have been proof that you were not.","We are what we believe we are!","A dragon has just flown over the tree-tops and lighted on the beach. Yes, I am afraid it is between us and the ship. And arrows are no use against dragons. And they\'re not at all afraid of fire.\\"\\"With your Majesty\'s leave-\\" began Reepicheep.\\"No, Reepicheep,\\" said the King very firmly, \\"you are not to attempt a single combat with it.","Aslan\\" said Lucy \\"you\'re bigger\\".\\"That is because you are older, little one\\" answered he.\\"Not because you are?\\"\\"I am not. But every year you grow, you will find me bigger.","For what you see and hear depends a good deal on where you are standing: it also depends on what sort of person you are.","Appreciative love gazes and holds its breath and is silent, rejoices that such a wonder should exist even if not for him, will not be wholly dejected by losing her, would rather have it so than never to have seen her at all.","Readers are advised to remember the devil is a liar.","In a sort of ghastly simplicity we remove the organ and demand the function. We make men without chests and expect of them virtue and enterprise. We laugh at honour and are shocked to find traitors in our midst. We castrate and bid the geldings be fruitful.","There have been men before \u2026 who got so interested in proving the existence of God that they came to care nothing for God himself\u2026 as if the good Lord had nothing to do but to exist. There have been some who were so preoccupied with spreading Christianity that they never gave a thought to Christ.","Getting over it so soon? But the words are ambiguous. To say the patient is getting over it after an operation for appendicitis is one thing; after he\u2019s had his leg off is quite another. After that operation either the wounded stump heals or the man dies. If it heals, the fierce, continuous pain will stop. Presently he\u2019ll get back his strength and be able to stump about on his wooden leg. He has \u2018got over it.\u2019 But he will probably have recurrent pains in the stump all his life, and perhaps pretty bad ones; and he will always be a one-legged man. There will be hardly any moment when he forgets it. Bathing, dressing, sitting down and getting up again, even lying in bed, will all be different. His whole way of life will be changed. All sorts of pleasures and activities that he once took for granted will have to be simply written off. Duties too. At present I am learning to get about on crutches. Perhaps I shall presently be given a wooden leg. But I shall never be a biped again.","But very quickly they all became grave again: for, as you know, there is a kind of happiness and wonder that makes you serious. It is too good to waste on jokes.","Repentance means unlearning all the self-conceit and self-will that we have been training ourselves into... It means killing part of yourself, undergoing a kind of death.","This world is a great sculptor\u2019s shop. We are the statues and there\u2019s a rumor going around the shop that some of us are someday going to come to life.","Some people feel guilty about their anxieties and regard them as a defect of faith. I don\'t agree at all. They are afflictions, not sins. Like all afflictions, they are, if we can so take them, our share in the Passion of Christ","Whatever their bodies do affects their souls. It is funny how mortals always picture us as putting things into their minds: in reality our best work is done by keeping things out...","This was bad grammar of course, but that is how beavers talk when they are excited; I mean, in Narnia--in our world they usually don\'t talk at all.- The Lion, The Witch, and the Wardrobe","Hell is a state of mind - ye never said a truer word. And every state of mind, left to itself, every shutting up of the creature within the dungeon of its own mind - is, in the end, Hell. But Heaven is not a state of mind. Heaven is reality itself. All that is fully real is Heavenly. For all that can be shaken will be shaken and only the unshakeable remains.","Are the gods not just?\\"\\"Oh no, child. What would become of us if they were?","Affliction is often that thing which prepares an ordinary person for some sort of an extraordinary destiny.","The books or the music in which we thought the beauty was located will betray us if we trust to them; it was not in them, it only came through them, and what came through them was longing. These things\u2014the beauty, the memory of our own past\u2014are good images of what we really desire; but if they are mistaken for the thing itself they turn into dumb idols, breaking the hearts of their worshipers. For they are not the thing itself; they are only the scent of a flower we have not found, the echo of a tune we have not heard, news from a country we have never yet visited.","It does not matter how small the sins are provided that their cumulative effect is to edge the man away from the Light and out into the Nothing. Murder is no better than cards if cards can do the trick. Indeed the safest road to Hell is the gradual one--the gentle slope, soft underfoot, without sudden turnings, without milestones, without signposts.","Affection is responsible for nine-tenths of whatever solid and durable happiness there is in our natural lives.","The event of falling in love is of such a nature that we are right to reject as intolerable the idea that it should be transitory. In one high bound it has overleaped the massive of our selfhood; it has made appetite itself altruistic, tossed personal happiness aside as a triviality and planted the interests of another in the centre of our being. Spontaneously and without effort we have fulfilled the law (towards one person) by loving our neighbour as ourselves. It is an image, a foretaste, of what we must become to all if Love Himself rules in us without a rival. It is even (well used) a preparation for that.","Humans are amphibians...half spirit and half animal...as spirits they belong to the eternal world, but as animals they inhabit time. This means that while their spirit can be directed to an eternal object, their bodies, passions, and imaginations are in continual change, for to be in time, means to change. Their nearest approach to constancy, therefore, is undulation--the repeated return to a level from which they repeatedly fall back, a series of troughs and peaks.","Let\'s pray that the human race never escapes Earth to spread its iniquity elsewhere.","God will invade. But I wonder whether people who ask God to interfere openly and directly in our world quite realise what it will be like when He does. When that happens, it is the end of the world. When the author walks on to the stage the play is over. God is going to invade, all right: but what is the good of saying you are on His side then, when you see the whole natural universe melting away like a dream and something else - something it never entered your head to conceive - comes crashing in; something so beautiful to some of us and so terrible to others that none of us will have any choice left? For this time it will God without disguise; something so overwhelming that it will strike either irresistible love or irresistible horror into every creature. It will be too late then to choose your side. There is no use saying you choose to lie down when it has become impossible to stand up. That will not be the time for choosing; it will be the time when we discover which side we really have chosen, whether we realised it before or not. Now, today, this moment, is our chance to choose the right side. God is holding back to give us that chance. It will not last for ever. We must take it or leave it.","The great difficulty is to get modern audiences to realize that you are preaching Christianity solely and simply because you happen to think it true; they always suppose you are preaching it because you like it or think it good for society or something of that sort. Now a clearly maintained distinction between what the Faith actually says and what you would like it to have said or what you understand or what you personally find helpful or think probable, forces your audience to realize that you are tied to your data just as the scientist is tied by the results of the experiments; that you are not just saying what you like. This immediately helps them realize that what is being discussed is a question about objective fact \u2014 not gas about ideals and points of view.","It is as hard to explain how this sunlit land was different from the old Narnia as it would be to tell you how the fruits of that country taste. Perhaps you will get some idea of it if you think like this. You may have been in a room in which there was a window that looked out on a lovely bay of the sea or a green valley that wound away among mountains. And in the wall of that room opposite to the window there may have been a looking-glass. And as you turned away from the window you suddenly caught sight of that sea or that valley, all over again, in the looking glass. And the sea in the mirror, or the valley in the mirror, were in one sense just the same as the real ones: yet at the same time they were somehow different - deeper, more wonderful, more like places in a story: in a story you have never heard but very much want to know. The difference between the old Narnia and the new Narnia was like that. The new one was a deeper country: every rock and flower and blade of grass looked as if it meant more.","In a perfect Friendship this Appreciative love is, I think, often so great and so firmly based that each member of the circle feels, in his secret heart, humbled before the rest. Sometimes he wonders what he is doing there among his betters. He is lucky beyond desert to be in such company. Especially when the whole group is together; each bringing out all that is best, wisest, or funniest in all the others. Those are the golden sessions; when four or five of us after a hard day\'s walk have come to our inn; when our slippers are on, our feet spread out toward the blaze and our drinks are at our elbows; when the whole world, and something beyond the world, opens itself to our minds as we talk; and no one has any claim on or any responsibility for another, but all are freemen and equals as if we had first met an hour ago, while at the same time an Affection mellowed by the years enfolds us. Life \u2014 natural life \u2014 has no better gift to give. Who could have deserved it?","You can\u2019t go on \u201cseeing through things forever. The whole point of seeing through something is to see something through it. To \u201csee through\u201d all things is the same as not to see.\u201d","I ended my first book with the words \'no answer.\' I know now, Lord, why you utter no answer. You are yourself the answer. Before your face questions die away. What other answer would suffice? Only words, words; to be led out to battle against other words.","Well, sir, if things are real, they\u2019re there all the time.\\"\\"Are they?\\" said the Professor; and Peter did not quite know what to say.","We are always falling in love or quarreling, looking for jobs or fearing to lose them, getting ill and recovering, following public affairs. If we let ourselves, we shall always be waiting for some distraction or other to end before we can really get down to our work. The only people who achieve much are those who want knowledge so badly that they seek it while the conditions are still unfavorable. Favorable conditions never come.","First came bright Spirits, not the Spirits of men, who danced and scattered flowers. Then, on the left and right, at each side of the forest avenue, came youthful shapes, boys upon one hand, and girls upon the other. If I could remember their singing and write down the notes, no man who read that score would ever grow sick or old. Between them went musicians: and after these a lady in whose honour all this was being done. \\tI cannot now remember whether she was naked or clothed. If she were naked, then it must have been the almost visible penumbra of her courtesy and joy which produces in my memory the illusion of a great and shining train that followed her across the happy grass. If she were clothed, then the illusion of nakedness is doubtless due to the clarity with which her inmost spirit shone through the clothes. For clothes in that country are not a disguise: the spiritual body lives along each thread and turns them into living organs. A robe or a crown is there as much one of the wearer\'s features as a lip or an eye.  \\tBut I have forgotten. And only partly do I remember the unbearable beauty of her face. \\t\u201cIs it?...is it? I whispered to my guide.\\t\u201cNot at all,\u201d said he. \u201cIt\'s someone ye\'ll never have heard of. Her name on earth was Sarah Smith and she lived at Golders Green.\u201d\\t\u201cShe seems to be...well, a person of particular importance?\u201d\\t\u201cAye. She is one of the great ones. Ye have heard that fame in this country and fame on Earth are two quite different things.\u201d\\t\u201cAnd who are these gigantic people...look! They\'re like emeralds...who are dancing and throwing flowers before here?\u201d\\t\u201cHaven\'t ye read your Milton? A thousand liveried angels lackey her.\u201d\\t\u201cAnd who are all these young men and women on each side?\u201d\\t\u201cThey are her sons and daughters.\u201d\\t\u201cShe must have had a very large family, Sir.\u201d\\t\u201cEvery young man or boy that met her became her son \u2013 even if it was only the boy that brought the meat to her back door. Every girl that met her was her daughter.\u201d\\t\u201cIsn\'t that a bit hard on their own parents?\u201d\\t\u201cNo. There are those that steal other people\'s children. But her motherhood was of a different kind. Those on whom it fell went back to their natural parents loving them more. Few men looked on her without becoming, in a certain fashion, her lovers. But it was the kind of love that made them not less true, but truer, to their own wives.\u201d\\t\u201cAnd how...but hullo! What are all these animals? A cat-two cats-dozens of cats. And all those dogs...why, I can\'t count them. And the birds. And the horses.\u201d\\t\u201cThey are her beasts.\u201d\\t\u201cDid she keep a sort of zoo? I mean, this is a bit too much.\u201d\\t\u201cEvery beast and bird that came near her had its place in her love. In her they became themselves. And now the abundance of life she has in Christ from the Father flows over into them.\u201d\\tI looked at my Teacher in amazement.\\t\u201cYes,\u201d he said. \u201cIt is like when you throw a stone into a pool, and the concentric waves spread out further and further. Who knows where it will end? Redeemed humanity is still young, it has hardly come to its full strength. But already there is joy enough int the little finger of a great saint such as yonder lady to waken all the dead things of the universe into life.\u201d","A woman means by Unselfishness chiefly taking trouble for others; a man means not giving trouble to others...thus, while the woman thinks of doing good offices and the man of respecting other people\u2019s rights, each sex, without any obvious unreason, can and does regard the other as radically selfish.","Need-love says of a woman, \\"I cannot live without her\\"; Gift-love longs to give her happiness, comfort, protection...appreciative love gazes and holds its breath and is silent, rejoices that such a wonder should exist even if not for him, will not be wholly dejected by losing her, would rather have it so than never to have seen her at all.","And yet all loneliness, angers, hatreds, envies, and itchings that (Hell) contains, if rolled into one single experience and put into the scale against the least moment of the joy that is felt by the least in Heaven, would have no weight that could be registered at all. Bad cannot succeed even in being bad as truly as good is good.","Every time you make a choice you are turning the central part of you, the part of you that chooses, into something a little different than it was before. And taking your life as a whole, with all your innumerable choices, all your life long you are slowly turning this central thing into a heavenly creature or a hellish creature: either into a creature that is in harmony with God, and with other creatures, and with itself, or else into one that is in a state of war and hatred with God, and with its fellow creatures, and with itself. To be the one kind of creature is heaven: that is, it is joy and peace and knowledge and power. To be the other means madness, horror, idiocy, rage, impotence, and eternal loneliness. Each of us at each moment is progressing to the one state of the other.","His Omnipotence means power to do all that is intrinsically possible, not to do the intrinsically impossible. You may attribute miracles to Him, but not nonsense. This is no limit to His power. If you choose to say, \u2018God can give a creature free will and at the same time withhold free will from it,\u2019 you have not succeeded in saying anything about God: meaningless combinations of words do not suddenly acquire meaning simply because we prefix to them the two other words, \'God can.\' It remains true that all things are possible with God: the intrinsic impossibilities are not things but nonentities. It is no more possible for God than for the weakest of His creatures to carry out both of two mutually exclusive alternatives; not because His power meets an obstacle, but because nonsense remains nonsense even when we talk it about God.","It comes the very moment you wake up each morning. All your wishes and hopes for the day rush at you like wild animals. And the first job each morning consists simply in shoving them all back; in listening to that other voice, taking that other point of view, letting that other larger, stronger, quieter life come flowing in. And so on, all day. Standing back from all your natural fussings and frettings; coming in out of the wind.","Her absence is like the sky, spread over everything.But no, that is not quite accurate. There is one place where her absence comes locally home to me, and it is a place I can\'t avoid. I mean my own body. It had such a different importance while it was the body of H.\'s lover. Now it\'s like an empty house.","God, who needs nothing, loves into existence wholly superfluous creatures in order that He may love and perfect them. He creates the universe, already foreseeing - or should we say \\"seeing\\"? there are no tenses in God - the buzzing cloud of flies about the cross, the flayed back pressed against the uneven stake, the nails driven through the mesial nerves, the repeated incipient suffocation as the body droops, the repeated torture of back and arms as it is time after time, for breath\'s sake, hitched up. If I may dare the biological image, God is a \\"host\\" who deliberately creates His own parasites; causes us to be that we may exploit and \\"take advantage of\\" Him. Herein is love. This is the diagram of Love Himself, the inventor of all loves.","The husband is the head of the wife just in so far as he is to her what Christ is to the Church - read on - and give his life for her (Eph. V, 25). This headship, then, is most fully embodied not in the husband we should all wish to be but in him whose marriage is most like a crucifixion; whose wife receives most and gives least, is most unworthy of him, is - in her own mere nature - least lovable. For the Church has not beauty but what the Bride-groom gives her; he does not find, but makes her, lovely. The chrism of this terrible coronation is to be seen not in the joys of any man\'s marriage but in its sorrows, in the sickness and sufferings of a good wife or the faults of a bad one, in his unwearying (never paraded) care or his inexhaustible forgiveness: forgiveness, not acquiescence. As Christ sees in the flawed, proud, fanatical or lukewarm Church on earth that Bride who will one day be without spot or wrinkle, and labours to produce the latter, so the husband whose headship is Christ-like (and he is allowed no other sort) never despairs. He is a King Cophetua who after twenty years still hopes that the beggar-girl will one day learn to speak the truth and wash behind her ears.","You are always dragging me down,\' said I to my Body. \'Dragging _you_ down!\' replied my Body. \'Well I like that! Who taught me to like tobacco and alcohol? You, of course, with your idiotic adolescent idea of being \\"grown up\\". My palate loathed both at first: but you would have your way. Who put an end to all those angry and revengeful thoughts last night? Me, of course, by insisting on going to sleep. Who does his best to keep you from talking too much and eating too much by giving you dry throats and headaches and indigestion? Eh?\' \'And what about sex?\' said I. \'Yes, what about it?\' retorted the Body. \'If you and your wretched imagination would leave me alone I\'d give you no trouble. That\'s Soul all over; you give me orders and then blame me for carrying them out.","The moment you have a self at all, there is a possibility of putting yourself first - wanting to be the centre - wanting to be God, in fact. That was the sin of Satan: and that was the sin he taught the human race. Some people think the fall of man had something to do with sex, but that is a mistake...what Satan put into the heads of our remote ancestors was the idea that they \'could be like Gods\' - could set up on their own as if they had created themselves - be their own masters - invent some sort of happiness for themselves outside God, apart from God. And out of that hopeless attempt has come...the long terrible story of man trying to find something other than God which will make him happy.","None of the children knew who Aslan was any more than you do; but the moment the Beaver had spoken these words everyone felt quite different. Perhaps it has sometimes happened to you in a dream that someone says something which you don\'t understand but in the dream it feels as if it had some enormous meaning--either a terrifying one which turns the whole dream into a nightmare or else a lovely meaning too lovely to put into words, which makes the dream so beautiful that you remember it all your life and are always wishing you could get into that dream again. It was like that now. At the name of Aslan each one of the children felt something jump in it\'s inside. Edmund felt a sensation of mysterious horror. Peter felt suddenly brave and adventurous. Susan felt as if some delicious smell or some delightful strain of music had just floated by her. And Lucy got the feeling you have when you wake up in the morning and realize that it is the beginning of the holidays or the beginning of Summer.","I felt ashamed.\\"\\"But of what? Psyche, they hadn\'t stripped you naked or anything?\\"\\"No, no, Maia. Ashamed of looking like a mortal -- of being a mortal.\\"\\"But how could you help that?\\"\\"Don\'t you think the things people are most ashamed of are things they can\'t help?","Try to exclude the possibility of suffering which the order of nature and the existence of free-wills involve, and you find that you have excluded life itself.","It was too perfect to last,\' so I am tempted to say of our marriage. But it can be meant in two ways. It may be grimly pessimistic - as if God no sooner saw two of His creatures happy than He stopped it (\'None of that here!\'). As if He were like the Hostess at the sherry-party who separates two guests the moment they show signs of having got into a real conversation. But it could also mean \'This had reached its proper perfection. This had become what it had in it to be. Therefore of course it would not be prolonged.\' As if God said, \'Good; you have mastered that exercise. I am very pleased with it. And now you are ready to go on to the next.","To enter heaven is to become more human than you ever succeeded in being on earth; to enter hell, is to be banished from humanity.","And so for a time it looked as if all the adventures were coming to an end; but that was not to be.","My own plans are made. While I can, I sail east in the Dawn Treader. When she fails me, I paddle east in my coracle. When she sinks, I shall swim east with my four paws. And when I can swim no longer, if I have not reached Aslan\u2019s country, or shot over the edge of the world into some vast cataract, I shall sink with my nose to the sunrise.","When two humans have lived together for many years it usually happens that each has tones of voice and expressions of face which are almost unendurably irritating to the other. Work on that. Bring fully into the consciousness of your patient that particular lift of his mother\'s eyebrows which he learned to dislike in the nursery, and let him think how much he dislikes it. Let him assume that she knows how annoying it is and does it to annoy - if you know your job he will not notice the immense improbability of the assumption. And, of course, never let him suspect that he has tones and looks which similarly annoy her. As he cannot see or hear himself, this easily managed.","We are, not metaphorically but in very truth, a Divine work of art, something that God is making, and therefore something with which He will not be satisfied until it has a certain character. Here again we come up against what I have called the \u201cintolerable compliment. Over a sketch made idly to amuse a child, an artist may not take much trouble: he may be content to let it go even though it is not exactly as he meant it to be. But over the great picture of his life\u2014the work which he loves, though in a different fashion, as intensely as a man loves a woman or a mother a child\u2014he will take endless trouble\u2014and would doubtless, thereby give endless trouble to the picture if it were sentient. One can imagine a sentient picture, after being rubbed and scraped and re-commenced for the tenth time, wishing that it were only a thumb-nail sketch whose making was over in a minute. In the same way, it is natural for us to wish that God had designed for us a less glorious and less arduous destiny; but then we are wishing not for more love but for less.\u201d","If a mother is mourning not for what she has lost but for what her dead child has lost, it is a comfort to believe that the child has not lost the end for which it was created. And it is a comfort to believe that she herself, in losing her chief or only natural happiness, has not lost a greater thing, that she may still hope to \\"glorify God and enjoy Him forever.\\" A comfort to the God-aimed, eternal spirit within her. But not to her motherhood. The specifically maternal happiness must be written off. Never, in any place or time, will she have her son on her knees, or bathe him, or tell him a story, or plan for his future, or see her grandchild.","I daren\'t come and drink,\\" said Jill. Then you will die of thirst,\\" said the Lion.Oh dear!\\" said Jill, coming another step nearer.\\"I suppose I must go and look for another stream then.\\"There is no other stream,\\" said the Lion.","Suppose one reads a story of filthy atrocities in the paper. Then suppose that something turns up suggesting that the story might not be quite true, or not quite so bad as it was made out. Is one\'s first feeling, \'Thank God, even they aren\'t quite so bad as that,\' or is it a feeling of disappointment, and even a determination to cling to the first story for the sheer pleasure of thinking your enemies are as bad as possible? If it is the second then it is, I am afraid, the first step in a process which, if followed to the end, will make us into devils. You see, one is beginning to wish that black was a little blacker. If we give that wish its head, later on we shall wish to see grey as black, and then to see white itself as black. Finally we shall insist on seeing everything -- God and our friends and ourselves included -- as bad, and not be able to stop doing it: we shall be fixed for ever in a universe of pure hatred.","Your Majesty would have a perfect right to strike off his head,\\" said Peridan. \\"Such an assault as he made puts him on a level with assassins.\\"\\"It is very true,\\" said Edmund. \\"But even a traitor may mend. I have known one that did.\\" And he looked very thoughtful.","Be not deceived, Wormwood, our cause is never more in jeopardy than when a human, no longer desiring but still intending to do our Enemy\'s will, looks round upon a universe in which every trace of Him seems to have vanished, and asks why he has been forsaken, and still obeys.","I wish I had never been born,\\" she said. \\"What are we born for?\\" \\"For infinite happiness,\\" said the Spirit. \\"You can step out into it at any moment...","I think all Christians would agree with me if I said that though Christianity seems at first to be all about morality, all about duties and rules and guilt and virtue, yet it leads you on, out of all that, into something beyond. One has a glimpse of a country where they do not talk of those things, except perhaps as a joke. Everyone there is filled full with what we should call goodness as a mirror is filled with light. But they do not call it goodness. They do not call it anything. They are not thinking of it. They are too busy looking at the source from which it comes. But this is near the stage where the road passes over the rim of our world. No one\'s eyes can see very far beyond that: lots of people\'s eyes can see further than mine.","Are you not thirsty?\\" said the Lion.\\"I am dying of thirst,\\" said Jill.\\"Then drink,\\" said the Lion.\\"May I \u2014 could I \u2014 would you mind going away while I do?\\" said Jill.The Lion answered this only by a look and a very low growl. And as Jill gazed at its motionless bulk, she realized that she might as well have asked the whole mountain to move aside for her convenience.The delicious rippling noise of the stream was driving her nearly frantic.\\"Will you promise not to \u2014 do anything to me, if I do come?\\" said Jill.\\"I make no promise,\\" said the Lion.Jill was so thirsty now that, without noticing it, she had come a step nearer.\\"Do you eat girls?\\" she said.\\"I have swallowed up girls and boys, women and men, kings and emperors, cities and realms,\\" said the Lion. It didn\'t say this as if it were boasting, nor as if it were sorry, nor as if it were angry. It just said it.\\"I daren\'t come and drink,\\" said Jill.\\"Then you will die of thirst,\\" said the Lion.\\"Oh dear!\\" said Jill, coming another step nearer. \\"I suppose I must go and look for another stream then.\\"\\"There is no other stream,\\" said the Lion.","To love you as I should, I must worship God as Creator. When I have learnt to love God better than my earthly dearest, I shall love my earthly dearest better than I do now. In so far as I learn to love my earthly dearest at the expense of God and instead of God, I shall be moving towards the state in which I shall not love my earthly dearest t all. When first things are put first, second things are not suppressed but increased.","We hear a great deal about the rudeness of the ris- ing generation. I am an oldster myself and might be expected to take the oldsters\' side, but in fact I have been far more impressed by the bad manners of par- ents to children than by those of children to parents. Who has not been the embarrassed guest at family meals where the father or mother treated their grown-up offspring with an incivility which, offered to any other young people, would simply have termi- nated the acquaintance? Dogmatic assertions on mat- ters which the children understand and their elders don\'t, ruthless interruptions, flat contradictions, ridicule of things the young take seriously some- times of their religion insulting references to their friends, all provide an easy answer to the question \\"Why are they always out? Why do they like every house better than their home?\\" Who does not prefer civility to barbarism?","I think we delight to praise what we enjoy because the praise not merely expresses but completes the enjoyment; it is its appointed consummation. It is not out of compliment that lovers keep on telling one another how beautiful they are; the delight is incomplete till it is expressed. It is frustrating to have discovered a new author and not to be able to tell anyone how good he is; to come suddenly, at the turn of the road, upon some mountain valley of unexpected grandeur and then to have to keep silent because the people with you care for it no more than for a tin can in the ditch; to hear a good joke and find no one to share it with. . . . The Scotch catechism says that man\u2019s chief end is \u2018to glorify God and enjoy Him forever.\u2019 But we shall then know that these are the same thing. Fully to enjoy is to glorify. In commanding us to glorify Him, God is inviting us to enjoy Him.","the greatest service we can do to education today is to teach fewer subjects. No one has time to do more than a very few things well before he is twenty, and when we force a boy to be a mediocrity in a dozen subjects, we destroy his standards, perhaps for life.","Yes, said Queen Lucy. \u201cIn our world too, a stable once had something inside it that was bigger than our whole world.\u201d","If we insist on keeping Hell (or even earth) we shall not see Heaven: if we accept Heaven we shall not be able to retain even the smallest and most intimate souvenirs of Hell.","Man has been accustomed, ever since he was a boy, to having a dozen incompatible philosophies dancing about together inside his head. He doesn\'t think of doctrines as primarily \\"true\\" or \\"false,\\" but as \\"academic\\" or \\"practical,\\" \\"outworn\\" or \\"contemporary,\\" \\"conventional\\" or \\"ruthless.\\" Jargon, not argument, is your best ally in keeping him from the Church. Don\'t waste time trying to make him think that materialism is true! Make him think it is strong or stark or courageous\u2014that it is the philosophy of the future. That\'s the sort of thing he cares about.","It is my opinion that a story worth reading only in childhood is not worth reading even then.","Now the whole offer which Christianity makes is this: that we can, if we let God have His way, come to share in the life of Christ. If we do, we shall then be sharing a life which was begotten, not made, which always existed and always will exist. Christ is the Son of God. If we share in this kind of life we also shall be sons of God. We shall love the Father as He does and the Holy Ghost will arise in us. He came to this world and became a man in order to spread to other men the kind of life He has \u2014 by what I call \\"good infection.\\" Every Christian is to become a little Christ. The whole purpose of becoming a Christian is simply nothing else.","Logic!\\" said the Professor half to himself. \\"Why don\'t they teach logic at these schools? There are only three possibilities. Either your sister is telling lies, or she is mad, or she istelling the truth. You know she doesn\'t tell lies and it is obvious that she is not mad. For the moment then and unless any further evidence turns up, we must assume that she is telling the truth.","If conversion to Christianity makes no improvement in a man\'s outward actions \u2013 if he continues to be just a snobbish or spiteful or envious or ambitious as he was before \u2013 then I think we must suspect that his \'conversion\' was largely imaginary; and after one\'s original conversion, every time one thinks one has made an advance, that is the test to apply. Fine feelings, new insights, greater interest in \'religion\' mean nothing unless they make our actual behavior better; just as in an illness \'feeling better\' is not much good if the thermometer shows that your temperature is still going up. In that sense the outer world is quite right to judge Christianity by its results. Christ told us to judge by results. A tree is known by its fruit; or, as we say, the proof of the pudding is in the eating. When we Christians behave badly, or fail to behave well, we are making Christianity unbelievable to the outside world. The war-time posters told us that Careless Talk costs Lives. It is equally true that Careless Lives cost Talk. Our careless lives set the outer world taking; and we give them grounds for talking in a way that throws doubt on the truth of Christianity itself.","You are told to love your neighbour as yourself. How do you love yourself? When I look into my own mind, I find that I do not love myself by thinking myself a dear old chap or having affectionate feelings. I do not think that I love myself because I am particularly good, but just because I am myself and quite apart from my character. I might detest something which I have done. Nevertheless, I do not cease to love myself. In other words, that definite distinction that Christians make between hating sin and loving the sinner is one that you have been making in your own case since you were born. You dislike what you have done, but you don\'t cease to love yourself. You may even think that you ought to be hanged. You may even think that you ought to go to the Police and own up and be hanged. Love is not affectionate feeling, but a steady wish for the loved person\'s ultimate good as far as it can be obtained.","But there must be a real giving up of the self. You must throw it away\\"blindly\\" so to speak. Christ will indeed give you a real personality: but you must not go to Him for the sake of that. As long as your own personalityis what you are bothering about you are not going to Him at all. The veryfirst step is to try to forget about the self altogether. Your real, newself (which is Christ\'s and also yours, and yours just because it is His) will not come as long as you are looking for it. It will come when you are looking for Him. Does that sound strange? The same principle holds, you know, for more everyday matters. Even in social life, you will never make a good impression on other people until you stop thinking about what sort of impression you are making. Even in literature and art, no man who bothers about originality will ever be original: whereas if you simply try to tell the truth (without caring twopence how often it has been told before) you will, nine times out of ten, become original without ever having noticed it.The principle runs through all life from top to bottom. Give up your self,and you will find your real self. Lose your life and you will save it.Submit to death, death of your ambitions and favourite wishes every day and death of your whole body in the end: submit with every fibre of your being, and you will find eternal life. Keep back nothing. Nothing that you have not given away will ever be really yours. Nothing in you that has not died will ever be raised from the dead. Look for yourself, and you will find in the long run only hatred, loneliness, despair, rage, ruin, and decay. But look for Christ and you will find Him, and with Him everything else thrown in.","In writing. Don\'t use adjectives which merely tell us how you want us to feel about the thing you are describing. I mean, instead of telling us a thing was \\"terrible,\\" describe it so that we\'ll be terrified. Don\'t say it was \\"delightful\\"; make us say \\"delightful\\" when we\'ve read the description. You see, all those words (horrifying, wonderful, hideous, exquisite) are only like saying to your readers, \\"Please will you do my job for me.\\"[Letter to Joan Lancaster, 26 June 1956]","It is very true. But even a traitor may mend. I have known one who did.","You must picture me alone in that room in Magdalen, night after night, feeling, whenever my mind lifted even for a second from my work, the steady, unrelenting approach of Him whom I so earnestly desired not to meet. That which I greatly feared had at last come upon me. In the Trinity Term of 1929 I gave in, and admitted that God was God, and knelt and prayed: perhaps, that night, the most dejected and reluctant convert in all England. I did not then see what is now the most shining and obvious thing; the Divine humility which will accept a convert even on such terms. The Prodigal Son at least walked home on his own feet. But who can duly adore that Love which will open the high gates to a prodigal who is brought in kicking, struggling, resentful, and darting his eyes in every direction for a chance of escape? The words \u201ccompelle intrare, compel them to come in, have been so abused be wicked men that we shudder at them; but, properly understood, they plumb the depth of the Divine mercy. The hardness of God is kinder than the softness of men, and His compulsion is our liberation.\u201d","No man knows how bad he is till he has tried very hard to be good.","Every poet and musician and artist, but for Grace, is drawn away from the love of the thing he tells, to the love of the telling till, down in Deep Hell, they cannot be interested in God at all but only in what they say about Him","Then I fell at his feet and thought, Surely this is the hour of death, for the Lion (who is worthy of all honour) will know that I have served Tash all my days and not him. Nevertheless, it is better to see the Lion and die than to be Tisroc of the world and live and not to have seen him. But the Glorious One bent down his golden head and touched my forehead with his tongue and said, Son, thou art welcome. But I said, Alas Lord, I am no son of thine but the servant of Tash. He answered, Child, all the service thou hast done to Tash, I account as service done to me. Then by reasons of my great desire for wisdom and understanding, I overcame my fear and questioned the Glorious One and said, Lord, is it then true, as the Ape said, that thou and Tash are one? The Lion growled so that the earth shook (but his wrath was not against me) and said, It is false. Not because he and I are one, but because we are opposites, I take to me the services which thou hast done to him. For I and he are of such different kinds that no service which is vile can be done to me, and none which is not vile can be done to him. Therefore if any man swear by Tash and keep his oath for the oath\u2019s sake, it is by me that he has truly sworn, though he know it not, and it is I who reward him. And if any man do a cruelty in my name, then, though he says the name Aslan, it is Tash whom he serves and by Tash his deed is accepted. Dost thou understand, Child? I said, Lord, though knowest how much I understand. But I said also (for the truth constrained me), Yet I have been seeking Tash all my days. Beloved, said the Glorious One, unless thy desire had been for me thou wouldst not have sought so long and so truly. For all find what they truly seek.","Will the others see you too?\\" asked Lucy.\\"Certainly not at first,\\" said Aslan. \\"Later on, it depends.\\"\\"But they won\u2019t believe me!\\" said Lucy.\\"It doesn\u2019t matter.","Now at last they were beginning Chapter One of the Great Story which no one on earth has read: which goes on for ever: in which every chapter is better than the one before.","Alone among unsympathetic companions, I hold certain views and standards timidly, half ashamed to avow them and half doubtful if they can after all be right. Put me back among my Friends and in half an hour - in ten minutes - these same views and standards become once more indisputable. The opinion of this little circle, while I am in it, outweighs that of a thousand outsiders: as Friendship strengthens, it will do this even when my Friends are far away. For we all wish to be judged by our peers, by the men \\"after our own heart.\\" Only they really know our mind and only they judge it by standards we fully acknowledge. Theirs is the praise we really covet and the blame we really dread.","But in Friendship, being free of all that, we think we have chosen our peers. In reality, a few years\' difference in the dates of our births, a few more miles between certain houses, the choice of one university instead of another, posting to different regiments, the accident of a topic being raised or not raised at a first meeting\u2014any of these chances might have kept us apart. But, for a Christian, there are, strictly speaking, no chances. A secret Master of the Ceremonies has been at work. Christ, who said to the disciples \\"Ye have not chosen me, but I have chosen you,\\" can truly say to every group of Christian friends \\"You have not chosen one another but I have chosen you for one another.\\" The Friendship is not a reward for our discrimination and good taste in finding one another out. It is the instrument by which God reveals to each the beauties of all the others. They are no greater than the beauties of a thousand other men; by Friendship God opens our eyes to them. They are, like all beauties, derived from Him, and then, in a good Friendship, increased by Him through the Friendship itself, so that it is His instrument for creating as well as for revealing.","He is not a tame lion,\\" said Tirian. \\"How should we know what he would do? We, who are murderers. Jewel, I will go back. I will give up my sword and put myself in the hands of these Calormenes and ask that they bring me before Aslan. Let him do justice on me.\\"\\"You will go to your death, then,\\" said Jewel.\\"Do you think I care if Aslan dooms me to death?\\" said the King. \\"That would be nothing, nothing at all. Would it not be better to be dead than to have this horrible fear that Aslan has come and is not like the Aslan we have believed in and longed for? It is as if the sun rose one day and were a black sun.\\"\\"I know,\\" said Jewel. \\"Or as if you drank water and it were dry water. You are in the right, Sire. This is the end of all things.

And I felt - I don\'t know what - I hated it. But I was hating everything then. And by the way, I\'d like to apologise.

You were only an ass, but I was a traitor.\\"\\"Well, don\'t tell me about it, then,\\" said Eustace. \\"But who is Aslan? Do you know him?\\"\\"Well - he knows me,\\" said Edmund. \\"He is the great Lion, the son of the Emperor-beyond-the-Sea, who saved me and saved Narnia. We\'ve all seen him. Lucy sees him most often. And it may be Aslan\'s country we are sailing to.","The complaint was the answer. To have heard myself making it was to be answered. Lightly men talk of saying what they mean. Often when he was teaching me to write in Greek the Fox would say, \'Child, to say the very thing you really mean, the whole of it, nothing more or less or other than what you really mean; that\'s the whole art and joy of words.\'A glib saying. When the time comes to you at which you will be forced at last to utter the speech which has lain at the center of your soul for years which you have, all that time, idiot-like, been saying over and over, you\'ll not talk about the joy of words. I saw well why the gods do not speak to us openly, nor let us answer. Till that word can be dug out of us, why should they hear the babble that we think we mean? How can they meet us face to face till we have faces?","And Nothing is very strong: strong enough to steal away a man\'s best years not in sweet sins but in a dreary flickering of the mind over it knows not what and knows not why, in the gratification of curiosities so feeble that the man is only half aware of them, in drumming of fingers and kicking of heels, in whistling tunes that he does not like, or in the long, dim labyrinth of reveries that have not even lust or ambition to give them a relish, but which, once chance association has started them, the creature is too weak and fuddled to shake off.","A great many of those who \\"debunk\\" traditional or (as they would say) \\"sentimental\\" values have in the background values of their own which they believe to be immune from the debunking process","For every one pupil who needs to be guarded against a weak excess of sensibility there are three who need to be awakened from the slumber of cold vulgarity. The task of the modern educator is not to cut down jungles but to irrigate deserts. The right defence against false sentiments is to inculcate just sentiments. By starving the sensibility of our pupils we only make them easier prey to the propagandist when he comes. For famished nature will be avenged and a hard heart is no infallible protection against a soft head.","I believe in political equality. But there are two opposite reasons for being a democrat. You may think all men so good that they deserve a share in the government of the commonwealth, and so wise that the commonwealth needs their advice. That is, in my opinion, the false, romantic doctrine of democracy. On the other hand, you may believe fallen men to be so wicked that not one of them can be trusted with any irresponsible power over his fellows.\\tThat I believe to be the true ground of democracy. I do not believe that God created an egalitarian world. I believe the authority of parent over child, husband over wife, learned over simple to have been as much a part of the original plan as the authority of man over beast. I believe that if we had not fallen...patriarchal monarchy would be the sole lawful government. But since we have learned sin, we have found, as Lord Acton says, that \'all power corrupts, and absolute power corrupts absolutely.\' The only remedy has been to take away the powers and substitute a legal fiction of equality. The authority of father and husband has been rightly abolished on the legal plane, not because this authority is in itself bad (on the contrary, it is, I hold, divine in origin), but because fathers and husbands are bad. Theocracy has been rightly abolished not because it is bad that learned priests should govern ignorant laymen, but because priests are wicked men like the rest of us. Even the authority of man over beast has had to be interfered with because it is constantly abused.","Hell begins with a grumbling mood, always complaining, always blaming others... but you are still distinct from it. You may even criticize it in yourself and wish you could stop it. But there may come a day when you can no longer. Then there will be no you left to criticize the mood or even to enjoy it, but just the grumble itself, going on forever like a machine. It is not a question of God \\"sending us\\" to hell. In each of us there is something growing, which will BE hell unless it is nipped in the bud.","My own idea, for what it is worth, is that all sadness which is not either arising from the repentance of a concrete sin and hastening towards concrete amendment or restitution, or else arising from pity and hastening to active assistance, is simply bad; and I think we all sin by needlessly disobeying the apostolic injunction to \'rejoice\' as much as by anything else.Humility, after the first shock, is a cheerful virtue.","And Peter became a tall and deep-chested man and a great warrior, and he was called King Peter the Magnificent. And Susan grew into a tall and gracious woman with black hair that fell almost to her feet and the kings of the countries beyond the sea began to send ambassadors asking for her hand in marriage. And she was called Queen Susan the Gentle. Edmund was a graver and quieter man than Peter, and great in council and judgment. he was called King Edmund the Just. But as for Lucy, she was always gay and golden-haired, and all princes in those parts desired her to be their Queen, and her own people called her Queen Lucy the Valiant.","Don\'t you like a rather foggy a in a wood in autumn?

The first is itself the memory of a memory. As I stood beside a flowering currant bush on a summer day there suddenly arose in me without warning, and as if from a depth not of years but of centuries, the memory of that earlier morning at the Old House when my brother had brought his toy garden into the nursery. It is difficult or find words strong enough for the sensation which came over me; Milton\'s \'enormous bliss\' of Eden (giving the full, ancient meaning to \'enormous\') comes somewhere near it. It was a sensation, of course, of desire; but desire for what?...Before I knew what I desired, the desire itself was gone, the whole glimpse... withdrawn, the world turned commonplace again, or only stirred by a longing for the longing that had just ceased... In a sense the central story of my life is about nothing else... The quality common to the three experiences... is that of an unsatisfied desire which is itself more desirable than any other satisfaction. I call it Joy, which is here a technical term and must be sharply distinguished both from Happiness and Pleasure. Joy (in my sense) has indeed one characteristic, and one only, in common with them; the fact that anyone who has experienced it will want it again... I doubt whether anyone who has tasted it would ever, if both were in his power, exchange it for all the pleasures in the world. But then Joy is never in our power and Pleasure often is.","Nothing will shake a man-or at any rate a man like me-out of his merely verbal thinking and his merely notional beliefs. He has to be knocked silly before he comes to his senses. Only torture will bring out the truth. Only under torture does he discover it himself.","Need-love cries to God from our poverty; Gift-love longs to serve, or even to suffer for, God; Appreciative love says: \u201cWe give thanks to thee for thy great glory. Need-love says of a woman \u201cI cannot live without her\u201d; Gift-love longs to give her happiness, comfort, protection \u2013 if possible, wealth; Appreciative love gazes and holds its breath and is silent, rejoices that such a wonder should exist even if not for him, will not be wholly dejected by losing her, would rather have it so than never to have seen her at all.\u201d p.17\u201d","The man who is contented to be only himself, and therefore less a self, is in prison. My own eyes are not enough for me, I will see through those of others. Reality, even seen through the eyes of many, is not enough. I will see what others have invented. Even the eyes of all humanity are not enough. I regret that the brutes connot write books. Very gladly would I learn what face things present to a mouse or a bee; more gladly still would I perceive the olfactory world charged with all the information and emotion it carries for a dog. Literary experience heals the wound, without undermining the privilege, of individuality... in reading great literature I become a thousand men and yet remain myself. Like the night sky in the Greek poem, I see with a myriad of eyes, but it is still I who see. Here, as in worship, in love, in moral action, and in knowing, I transcend myself; and am never more myself than when I do.","As the uneasiness and reluctance to face it cut him off more and more from all real happiness, and as habit renders the pleasures the vanity and excitement and flippancy at once less pleasant and harder to forgo...you will find that anything or nothing is sufficient to attract his wandering attention. You no longer need a good book, which he really likes, to keep him from his prayers or his work or his sleep; a column of advertisements in yesterday\'s paper will do. You can make him waste his time not only in conversation he enjoys with people whom he likes, but also in conversations with those he cares nothing about, on subjects that bore him. You can make him do nothing at all for long periods. You can keep him up late at night, not roistering, but staring at a dead fire in a cold room. All the healthy and outgoing activities which we want him to avoid can be inhibited and nothing given in return, so that at last he may say...\'I now see that I spent most my life doing in doing neither what I ought nor what I liked.","It is hard to have patience with people who say, \u2018There is no death\u2019 or \u2018Death doesn\u2019t matter.\u2019 There is death.

Why did one find it so hard to feel as one was told one ought to feel about God or the sufferings of Christ? I thought the chief reason was that one was told one ought to. An obligation to feel can freeze feelings. And reverence itself did harm. The whole subject was associated with lowered voices; almost as if it were something medical. But supposing that by casting all these things into an imaginary world, stripping them of their stained-glass and Sunday School associations, one could make them for the first time appear in their real potency? Could one not thus steal past those watchful dragons? I thought one could.","They call him Aslan in That Place,\\" said Eustace.\\"What a curious name!\\"\\"Not half so curious as himself,\\" said Eustace solemnly.","The bad psychological material is not a sin but a disease. It does not need to be repented of, but to be cured. And by the way, that is very important. Human beings judge one another by their external actions. God judges them by their moral choices. When a neurotic who has a pathological horror of cats forces himself to pick up a cat for some good reason, it is quite possible that in God\'s eyes he has shown more courage than a healthy man may have shown in winning the V.C. When a man who has been perverted from his youth and taught that cruelty is the right thing does dome tiny little kindness, or refrains from some cruelty he might have committed, and thereby, perhaps, risks being sneered at by his companions, he may, in God\'s eyes, be doing more than you and I would do if we gave up life itself for a friend.It is as well to put this the other way round. Some of us who seem quite nice people may, in fact, have made so little use of a good heredity and good upbringing that we are really worse than those whom we regard as fiends. Can we be quite certain how we should have behaved if we had been saddled with the psychological outfit, and then with the bad upbringing, and then with the power, say, of Himmler? That is why Christians are told not to judge. We see only the results which a man\'s choices make out of his raw material. But God does not judge him on the raw material at all, but on what he has done with it. Most of the man\'s psychological makeup is probably due to his body: when his body dies all that will fall off him, and the real central man, the thing that chose, that made the best or worst out of this material, will stand naked. All sorts of nice things which we thought our own, but which were really due to a good digestion, will fall off some of us: all sorts of nasty things which were due to complexes or bad health will fall off others. We shall then, for the first time, see every one as he really was. There will be surprises.","All that we call human history--money, poverty, ambition, war, prostitution, classes, empires, slavery--[is] the long terrible story of man trying to find something other than God which will make him happy.","Let me implore the reader to try to believe, if only for a moment, that God, who made these deserving people, may really be right when He thinks that their modest prosperity and the happiness of their children are not enough to make them blessed: that all this must fall from them in the end, and if they have not learned to know Him they will be wretched. And therefore He troubles them, warning them in advance of an insufficiency that one day they will have to discover. The life to themselves and their families stands between them and the recognition of their need; He makes that life less sweet to them.If God were proud He would hardly have us on such terms: but He is not proud, He stoops to conquer, He will have us even though we have shown that we prefer everything else to Him, and come to Him because there is \'nothing better\' now to be had.","This is the fix we are in. If the universe is not governed by an absolute goodness, then all our efforts are in the long run hopeless. But if it is, then we are making ourselves enemies to that goodness every day, and are not in the least likely to do any better tomorrow, and so our case is hopeless again. We cannot do without it, and we cannot do with it. God is the only comfort, He is also the supreme terror: the thing we most need and the thing we most want to hide from. He is our only possible ally, and we have made ourselves His enemies. Some people talk as if meeting the gaze of absolute goodness would be fun. They need to think again. They are still only playing with religion.","It may be possible for each to think too much of his own potential glory hereafter; it is hardly possible for him to think too often or too deeply about that of his neighbor. The load, or weight, or burden of my neighbor\'s glory should be laid daily on my back, a load so heavy that only humility can carry it, and the backs of the proud will be broken. ... \\"It is in light of these overwhelming possibilities, it is with the awe and the circumspection proper to them, that we should conduct all our dealings with one another, all friendships, all loves, all play, all politics. There are no ordinary people. You have never talked to a mere mortal. Nations, cultures, arts, civilizations -- these are mortal, and their life is to ours as the life of a gnat. But it is immortals whom we joke with, work with, marry, snub and exploit. ... Next to the Blessed Sacrament itself, your neighbor is the holiest object presented to your senses.","Even in social life, you will never make a good impression on other people until you stop thinking about what sort of impression you\'re making.","We must picture hell as a state where everyone is perpetually concerned about his own dignity and advancement, where everyone has a grievance, and where everyone lives with the deadly serious passions of envy, self-importance, and resentment.","Further up and further in","But I cannot tell that to this old sinner, and I cannot comfort him either; he has made himself unable to hear my voice. If I spoke to him, he would hear only growlings and roarings. Oh, Adam\'s son, how cleverly you defend yourself against all that might do you good!","You will say that these are very small sins; and doubtless, like all young tempters, you are anxious to be able to report spectacular wickedness. But do remember, the only thing that matters is the extent to which you separate the man from the Enemy. It does not matter how small the sins are provided that their cumulative effect is to edge the man away from the Light and out into the Nothing. Murder is no better than cards if cards can do the trick. Indeed the safest road to Hell is the gradual one-the gentle slope, soft underfoot, without sudden turnings, without milestones, without signposts.","The decay of Logic results from an untroubled assumption that the particular is real and the universal is not.","The human heart is not unchanging (nay, changes almost out of recognition in the twinkling of an eye)...","Though under earth, and throneless now I beYet while I lived all earth was under me.","Supposing there was no intelligence behind the universe, no creative mind. In that case, nobody designed my brain for the purpose of thinking. It is merely that when the atoms inside my skull happen, for physical or chemical reasons, to arrange themselves in a certain way, this gives me, as a by-product, the sensation I call thought. But, if so, how can I trust my own thinking to be true? It\'s like upsetting a milk jug and hoping that the way it splashes itself will give you a map of London. But if I can\'t trust my own thinking, of course I can\'t trust the arguments leading to Atheism, and therefore have no reason to be an Atheist, or anything else. Unless I believe in God, I cannot believe in thought: so I can never use thought to disbelieve in God.","The choice of every lost soul can be expressed in the words \\"Better to reign in Hell than serve in Heaven.","And grief still feels like fear. Perhaps, more strictly, like suspense. Or like waiting; just hanging about waiting for something to happen. It gives life a permanently provisional feeling. It doesn\'t seem worth starting anything. I can\'t settle down. I yawn, fidget, I smoke too much. Up till this I always had too little time. Now there is nothing but time. Almost pure time, empty successiveness.","In reading great literature I become a thousand men and yet remain myself. Like the night sky in the Greek poem, I see with a myriad eyes, but it is still I who see.","All Joy reminds. It is never a possession, always a desire for something longer ago or further away or still \'about to be\'.","Those of us who have been true readers all our life seldom fully realise the enormous extension of our being which we owe to authors. We realise it best when we talk with an unliterary friend. He may be full of goodness and good sense but he inhabits a tiny world. In it, we should be suffocated. The man who is contented to be only himself, and therefore less a self, is in prison. My own eyes are not enough for me, I will see through those of others. Reality, even seen through the eyes of many, is not enough. I will see what others have invented\u2026. In reading great literature I become a thousand men and yet remain myself. Like the night sky in the Greek poem, I see with a myriad eyes, but it is still I who see. Here, as in worship, in love, in moral action, and in knowing, I transcend myself; and am never more myself than when I do.","Do not look sad. We shall meet soon again.\\" \\"Please, Aslan\\", said Lucy,\\"what do you call soon?\\"\\"I call all times soon\\" said Aslan; and instantly he was vanished away.","If you think of this world as a place simply intended for our happiness, you find it quite intolerable: think of it as a place for training and correction and it\'s not so bad.","He does not despise real woods because he has read of enchanted woods; the reading makes all real woods a little enchanted.","I am a democrat [proponent of democracy] because I believe in the Fall of Man.I think most people are democrats for the opposite reason. A great deal of democratic enthusiasm descends from the ideas of people like Rousseau, who believed in democracy because they thought mankind so wise and good that every one deserved a share in the government.The danger of defending democracy on those grounds is that they\u2019re not true. . . . I find that they\u2019re not true without looking further than myself. I don\u2019t deserve a share in governing a hen-roost. Much less a nation. . . .The real reason for democracy is just the reverse. Mankind is so fallen that no man can be trusted with unchecked power over his fellows. Aristotle said that some people were only fit to be slaves. I do not contradict him. But I reject slavery because I see no men fit to be masters.","Once very near the end I said, \'If you can -- if it is allowed -- come to me when I too am on my death bed.\' \'Allowed!\' she said. \'Heaven would have a job to hold me; and as for Hell, I\'d break it into bits.","Who are you?\'One who has waited long for you to speak.","Nearly all vices are rooted in the future. Gratitude looks to the past and love to the present; fear, avarice, lust and ambition look ahead.","Slowly, quietly, like snow-flakes\u2014like the small flakes that come when it is going to snow all night\u2014little flakes of me, my impressions, my selections, are settling down on the image of her.

I may repeat \\"Do as you would be done by\\" till I am black in the fact, but I cannot really carry it out till I love my neighbour as myself: and I cannot learn to love my neighbour as myself till I learn to love God: and I cannot learn to love God except by learning to obey Him. And so, as I warned you, we are driven on to something more inward - driven on from social matters to religious matters.","I pray because I can\'t help myself. I pray because I\'m helpless. I pray because the need flows out of me all the time, waking and sleeping. It doesn\'t change God. It changes me.","Ceasing to be \'in love\' need not mean ceasing to love. Love in this second sense - love as distinct from \'being in love\' - is not merely a feeling. It is a deep unity, maintained by the will and deliberately strengthened by habit; reinforced by (in Christian marriages) the grace which both partners ask, and receive, from God. They can have this love for each other even at those moments when they do not like each other; as you love yourself even when you do not like yourself. They can retain this love even when each would easily, if they allowed themselves, be \'in love\' with someone else. \'Being in love\' first moved them to promise fidelity: this quieter love enables them to keep the promise.","Do you think I care if Aslan dooms me to death? said the King. \u201cThat would be nothing, nothing at all. Would it not be better to be dead than to have this horrible fear that Aslan has come and is not like the Aslan we have believed in and longed for? It is as if the sun rose one day and were a black sun.\u201d","I do not think there is a demonstrative proof (like Euclid) of Christianity, nor of the existence of matter, nor of the good will and honesty of my best and oldest friends. I think all three are (except perhaps the second) far more probable than the alternatives. The case for Christianity in general is well given by Chesterton\u2026As to why God doesn\'t make it demonstratively clear; are we sure that He is even interested in the kind of Theism which would be a compelled logical assent to a conclusive argument? Are we interested in it in personal matters? I demand from my friend trust in my good faith which is certain without demonstrative proof. It wouldn\'t be confidence at all if he waited for rigorous proof. Hang it all, the very fairy-tales embody the truth. Othello believed in Desdemona\'s innocence when it was proved: but that was too late. Lear believed in Cordelia\'s love when it was proved: but that was too late. \'His praise is lost who stays till all commend.\' The magnanimity, the generosity which will trust on a reasonable probability, is required of us. But supposing one believed and was wrong after all? Why, then you would have paid the universe a compliment it doesn\'t deserve. Your error would even so be more interesting and important than the reality. And yet how could that be? How could an idiotic universe have produced creatures whose mere dreams are so much stronger, better, subtler than itself?","Nor am I greatly moved by jocular inquiries such as, \'Where will you put all the mosquitoes?\' -- a question to be answered on its own level by pointing out that, if the worst came to worst, a heaven for mosquitoes and a hell for men could very conveniently be combined.","faith is the art of holding on to things in spite of your changing moods and circumstances.","Are not all lifelong friendships born at the moment when at last you meet another human being who has some inkling (but faint and uncertain even in the best) of that something which you were born desiring, and which, beneath the flux of other desires and in all the momentary silences between the louder passions, night and day, year by year, from childhood to old age, you are looking for, watching for, listening for? You have never had it. All the things that have ever deeply possessed your soul have been but hints of it -- tantalising glimpses, promises never quite fulfilled, echoes that died away just as they caught your ear. But if it should really become manifest -- if there ever came an echo that did not die away but swelled into the sound itself -- you would know it. Beyond all possibility of doubt you would say \\"Here at last is the thing I was made for.","Give up yourself, and you will find your real self. Lose your life and you will save it. Submit to death, death of your ambitions and favorite wishes every day and death of your whole body in the end submit with ever fiber of your being, and you will find eternal life. Keep back nothing. Nothing that you have not given away will be really yours. Nothing in you that has not died will ever be raised from the dead. Look for yourself, and you will find in the long run only hatred, loneliness, despair, rage, ruin, and decay. But look for Christ and you will find Him, and with Him everything else thrown in.","When you have reached your own room, be kind to those Who have chosendifferent doors and to those who are still in the hall.","for the greater the love the greater the grief, and the stronger the faith the more savagely will Satan storm its fortress.","Yes, said the Lord Digory, \u201cIts inside is bigger than its outside.\u201d\u201cYes,\u201d said Queen Lucy. \u201cIn our world too, a stable once had something inside it that was bigger than our whole world.\u201d","For all find what they truly seek.","Apparently, then, our lifelong nostalgia, our longing to be reunited with something in the universe from which we now feel cut off, to be on the inside of some door which we have always seen from the outside, is no mere neurotic fancy, but the truest index of our real situation. And to be at last summoned inside would be both glory and honour beyond all our merits and also the healing of that old ache.","God is the only comfort, He is also the supreme terror: the thing we most need and the thing we most want to hide from. He is our only possible ally, and we have made ourselves His enemies. Some people talk as if meeting the gaze of absolute goodness would be fun. They need to think again. They are still only playing with religion. Goodness is either the great safety or the great danger - according to the way you react to it. And we have reacted the wrong way.","The witch would have known that when a willing victim who had committed no treachery was killed in a traitor\u2019s stead, the Table would crack and Death itself would start working backwards.","The Friendship is not a reward for our discrimination and good taste in finding one another out. IT is the instrument by which God reveals to each the beauties of all the others. They are no greater than the beauties of a thousand other men; by Friendship God opens our eyes to them. They are, like all beauties, derived from Him, and then, in a good Friendship, increased by Him through the Friendship itself, so that it is His instrument for creating as well as for revealing. At this feast it is he who has spread the board and it is He who has chosen the guests. It is He, we may dare to hope, who sometimes does, and always should, preside. Let us not reckon without our Host.","The settled happiness and security which we all desire, God withholds from us by the very nature of the world: but joy, pleasure, and merriment, He has scattered broadcast. We are never safe, but we have plenty of fun, and some ecstasy. It is not hard to see why. The security we crave would teach us to rest our hearts in this world and oppose an obstacle to our return to God: a few moments of happy love, a landscape, a symphony, a merry meeting with out friends, a bathe or a football match, have no such tendency. Our Father refreshes us on the journey with some pleasant inns, but will not encourage us to mistake them for home.","My argument against God was that the universe seemed so cruel and unjust. But how had I got this idea of just and unjust? A man does not call a line crooked unless he has some idea of a straight line. What was I comparing this universe with when I called it unjust? If the whole show was bad and senseless from A to Z, so to speak, why did I, who was supposed to be part of the show, find myself in such a violent reaction against it?... Of course I could have given up my idea of justice by saying it was nothing but a private idea of my own. But if i did that, then my argument against God collapsed too--for the argument depended on saying the world was really unjust, not simply that it did not happen to please my fancies. Thus, in the very act of trying to prove that God did not exist - in other words, that the whole of reality was senseless - I found I was forced to assume that one part of reality - namely my idea of justice - was full of sense. If the whole universe has no meaning, we should never have found out that it has no meaning: just as, if there were no light in the universe and therefore no creatures with eyes, we should never have known it was dark. Dark would be without meaning.","Our cause is never more in danger than when a human, no longer desiring, but still intending, to do our Enemy\'s will, looks round upon a universe from which every trace of Him seems to have vanished, and asks why he has been forsaken, and still obeys.","the sun looks down on nothing half so good as a household laughing together over a meal, or two friends talking over a pint of beer, or a man alone reading a book that interests him...","And no one ever told me about the laziness of grief. Except at my job--where the machine seems to run on much as usual--I loathe the slightest effort. Not only writing but even reading a letter is too much.","We all want progress. But progress means getting nearer to the place where you want to be. And if you have taken a wrong turning then to go forward does not get you any nearer. If you are on the wrong road progress means doing an about-turn and walking back to the right road and in that case the man who turns back soonest is the most progressive man. There is nothing progressive about being pig-headed and refusing to admit a mistake. And I think if you look at the present state of the world it\'s pretty plain that humanity has been making some big mistake. We\'re on the wrong road. And if that is so we must go back. Going back is the quickest way on.","But when your sword breaks, you draw your dagger.","If people do not believe in permanent marriage, it is perhaps better that they should live together unmarried than that they should make vows they do not mean to keep. It is true that by living together without marriage they will be guilty (in Christian eyes) of fornication. But one fault is not mended by adding another; unchastity is not improved by adding perjury. The idea that \'being in love\' is the only reason for remaining married really leaves no room for marriage as a contract or promise at all. If love is the whole thing, then the promise can add nothing; and if it adds nothing, then it should not be made.","What we work out in our journals we don\u2019t take out on family and friends.","The Son of God became a man to enable men to become sons of God.","The Tao, which others may call Natural Law or Traditional Morality or the First Principles of Practical Reason or the First Platitudes, is not one among a series of possible systems of value. It is the sole source of all value judgments. If it is rejected, all value is rejected. If any value is retained, it is retained. The effort to refute it and raise a new system of value in its place is self-contradictory. There has never been, and never will be, a radically new judgment of value in the history of the world. What purport to be new systems or\u2026ideologies\u2026all consist of fragments from the Tao itself, arbitrarily wrenched from their context in the whole and then swollen to madness in their isolation, yet still owing to the Tao and to it alone such validity as they posses.","One of the drawbacks about adventures is that when you come to the most beautiful places you are often too anxious and hurried to appreciate them.","It is much easier to pray for a bore than to go visit him.","But if you are a poor creature--poisoned by a wretched up-bringing in some house full of vulgar jealousies and senseless quarrels--saddled, by no choice of your own, with some loathsome sexual perversion--nagged day in and day out by an inferiority complex that makes you snap at your best friends--do not despair. He knows all about it. You are one of the poor whom He blessed. He knows what a wretched machine you are trying to drive. Keep on. Do what you can. One day He will fling it on the scrap-heap and give you a new one. And then you may astonish us all - not least yourself: for you have learned your driving in a hard school.","Up till then he had been looking at the Lion\'s great front feet and the huge claws on them; now, in his despair, he looked up at its face. What he saw surprised him as much as anything in his whole life. For the tawny face was bent down near his own and (wonder of wonders) great shining tears stood in the Lion\'s eyes. They were such big, bright tears compared with Digory\'s own that for a moment he felt as if the Lion must really be sorrier about his Mother than he was himself. \\"My son, my son,\\" said Aslan. \\"I know. Grief is great. Only you and I in this land know that yet. Let us be good to one another.","People who have not been in Narnia sometimes think that a thing cannot be good and terrible at the same time.","Suppose we have only dreamed, or made up, all those things - trees and grass and sun and moon and stars and Aslan himself. Suppose we have. Then all I can say is that, in that case, the made-up things seem a good deal more important than the real ones. Suppose this black pit of a kingdom of yours is the only world. Well, it strikes me as a pretty poor one.","Never use abstract nouns when concrete ones will do. If you mean \u201cMore people died don\u2019t say \u201cMortality rose.\u201d","If anyone says that sex, in itself, is bad, Christianity contradicts him at once. But, of course, when people say, \'Sex is nothing to be ashamed of,\' they may mean \'the state into which the sexual instinct has now got is nothing to be ashamed of\'. If they mean that, I think they are wrong. I think it is everything to be ashamed of. There is nothing to be ashamed of in enjoying your food: there would be everything to be ashamed of if half the world made food the main interest of their lives and spent their time looking at pictures of food and dribbling and smacking their lips.","One must face the fact that all the talk about His love for men, and His service being perfect freedom, is not (as one would gladly believe) mere propaganda, but an appalling truth. He really does want to fill the universe with a lot of loathsome little replicas of Himself\u2014creatures, whose life, on its miniature scale, will be qualitatively like His own, not because He hasabsorbed them but because their wills freely conform to His. We want cattle who can finally become food; (2) He wants servants who can finally become sons. We want to suck in, He wants to give out. We are empty and would be filled; He is full and flows over. Our war aim is a world in which Our Father Below has drawn all other beings into himself: the Enemy wants a world full of beings united to Him but still distinct.","How many hours are there in a mile? Is yellow square or round? Probably half the questions we ask-half our great theological and metaphysical problems-are like that.","We may be sure that the characteristic blindness of the twentieth century - the blindness about which posterity will ask, \\"But how could they have thought that?\\" - lies where we have never suspected it... None of us can fully escape this blindness, but we shall certainly increase it, and weaken our guard against it, if we read only modern books. Where they are true they will give us truths which we half knew already. Where they are false they will aggravate the error with which we are already dangerously ill. The only palliative is to keep the clean sea breeze of the centuries blowing through our minds, and this can be done only by reading old books.","For us of course the shared activity and therefore the companionship on which Friendship supervenes will not often be a bodily one like hunting or fighting. It may be a common religion, common studies, a common profession, even a common recreation. All who share it will be our companions; but one or two or three who share something more will be our Friends. In this kind of love, as Emerson said, Do you love me? means Do you see the same truth? - Or at least, \\"Do you care about the same truth?\\" The man who agrees with us that some question, little regarded by others, is of great importance can be our Friend. He need not agree with us about the answer.","Hence the uneasiness which they arouse in those who, for whatever reason, wish to keep us wholly imprisoned in the immediate conflict. That perhaps is why people are so ready with the charge of \\"escape.\\" I never fully understood it till my friend Professor Tolkien asked me the very simple question, \\"What class of men would you expect to be most preoccupied with, and hostile to, the idea of escape?\\" and gave the obvious answer: jailers.","How monotonously alike all the great tyrants and conquerors have been; how gloriously different are the saints.","Who are you? asked Shasta.\u201cMyself,\u201d said the Voice, very deep and low so that the earth shook: and again \u201cMyself,\u201d loud and clear and gay: and then the third time \u201cMyself,\u201d whispered so softly you could hardly hear it, and yet it seemed to come from all around you as if the leaves rustled with it.\u201d","Don\'t shine so others can see you.

Then he draws a moral. This is what comes, he says, of giving one\u2019s heart to anything but God. All human beings pass away. Do not let your happiness depend on something you may lose. If love is to be a blessing, not a misery, it must be for the only Beloved who will never pass away.","Though our feelings come and go, God\u2019s love for us does not.","Why you fool, it\'s the educated reader who CAN be gulled. All our difficulty comes with the others. When did you meet a workman who believes the papers? He takes it for granted that they\'re all propaganda and skips the leading articles. He buys his paper for the football results and the little paragraphs about girls falling out of windows and corpses found in Mayfair flats. He is our problem. We have to recondition him. But the educated public, the people who read the high-brow weeklies, don\'t need reconditioning. They\'re all right already. They\'ll believe anything.","Bent creatures are full of fears","The bolt of Tash falls from above!\'\'Does it ever get caught on a hook halfway?","No sooner do we believe that God loves us than there is an impulse to believe that He does so, not because He is Love, but because we are intrinsically lovable. The Pagans obeyed this impulse unabashed; a good man was \\"dear to the gods\\" because he was good. We, being better taught, resort to subterfuge. Far be it from us to think that we have virtues for which God could love us. But then, how magnificently we have repented! As Bunyan says, describing his first and illusory conversion, \\"I thought there was no man in England that pleased God better than I.\\" Beaten out of this, we next offer our own humility to God\'s admiration. Surely He\'ll like that? Or if not that, our clear-sighted and humble recognition that we still lack humility. Thus, depth beneath depth and subtlety within subtelty, there remains some lingering idea of our own, our very own attractiveness. It is easy to acknowledge, but almost impossible to realize for long, that we are mirrors whose brightness, if we are bright, is wholly derived from the sun that shines upon us. Surely we must have a little--however little--native luminosity? Surely we can\'t be quite creatures? - The Four Loves","But what manner of use would it be ploughing through that darkness?\' asked Drinian.Use?\' replied Reepicheep. \'Use, Captain?\' If you mean by filling our bellies or our purses, I confess it will be no use at all. So far as I know we did not set sail to look for things useful but to seek honour and adventures. And here is as great an adventure as I have ever heard of, and here, if we turn back, no little impeachment of all our honours.","Talk to me about the truth of religion and I\'ll listen gladly. Talk to me about the duty of religion and I\'ll listen submissively. But don\'t come talking to me about the consolations of religion or I shall suspect that you don\'t understand. Unless, of course, you can literally believe all that stuff about family reunions \'on the further shore,\' pictured in entirely earthly terms. But that is all unscriptural, all out of bad hymns and lithographs. There\'s not a word of it in the Bible. And it rings false. We know it couldn\'t be like that. Reality never repeats. The exact same thing is never taken away and given back. How well the Spiritualists bait their hook! \'Things on this side are not so different after all.\' There are cigars in Heaven.

No book is really worth reading at the age of ten which is not equally (and often far more) worth reading at the age of fifty \u2013 except, of course, books of information. The only imaginative works we ought to grow out of are those which it would have been better not to have read at all.","Lightly men talk of saying what they mean. Often when he was teaching me to write in Greek the Fox would say, \u201cChild, to say the very thing you really mean, the whole of it, nothing more or less or other than what you really mean; that\u2019s the whole art and joy of words. A glib saying. When the time comes to you at which you will be forced at last to utter the speech which has lain at the centre of your soul for years, which you have, all that time, idiot-like, been saying over and over, you\u2019ll not talk about joy of words.\u201d","All this is flashy rhetoric about loving you.I never had a selfless thought since I was born.I am mercenary and self-seeking through and through:I want God, you, all friends, merely to serve my turn.Peace, re-assurance, pleasure, are the goals I seek,I cannot crawl one inch outside my proper skin:I talk of love --a scholar\'s parrot may talk Greek--But, self-imprisoned, always end where I begin.Only that now you have taught me (but how late) my lack.I see the chasm. And everything you are was makingMy heart into a bridge by which I might get backFrom exile, and grow man. And now the bridge is breaking.For this I bless you as the ruin falls. The painsYou give me are more precious than all other gains.","Did you ever know, dear, how much you took away with you when you left? You have stripped me even of my past, even of the things we never shared.","In a word, we may reasonably hope for the virtual abolition of education when I\'m as good as you has fully had its way. All incentives to learn and all penalties for not learning will vanish.The few who might want to learn will be prevented; who are they to overtop their fellows? And anyway the teachers--or should I say, nurses?--will be far too busy reassuring the dunces and patting them on the back to waste any time on real teaching. We shall no longer have to plan and toil to spread imperturable conceit and incurable ignorance among men. The little vermin themselves will do it for us.","Then two wonders happened at the same moment. One was that the voice was suddenly joined by other voices; more voices than you could possibly count. They were in harmony with it, but far higher up the scale: cold, tingling, silvery voices. The second wonder was that the blackness overhead, all at once, was blazing with stars. They didn\u2019t come out gently one by one, as they do on a summer evening. One moment there had been nothing but darkness; next moment a thousand, thousand points of light leaped out \u2013 single stars, constellations, and planets, brighter and bigger than any in our world. There were no clouds. The new stars and the new voices began at exactly the same time. If you had seen and heard it, as Digory did, you would have felt quite certain that it was the stars themselves which were singing, and that it was the First Voice, the deep one, which had made them appear and made them sing.","Why should your Majesty expect it? My own plans are made. While I can, I sail east in the Dawn Treader. When she fails me, I paddle east in my coracle. When she sinks, I shall swim east with my four paws. And when I can swim no longer, if I have not reached Aslan\u2019s country, or shot over the edge of the world in some vast cataract, I shall sink with my nose to the sunrise and Peepiceek will be head of the talking mice in Narnia.","You see, Aslan didn\'t tell Pole what would happen. He only told her what to do. That fellow will be the death of us once he\'s up, I shouldn\'t wonder. But that doesn\'t let us off following the signs.- The Silver Chair","Quarrelling means trying to show that the other man is in the wrong. (And) There is no sense in trying to do that unless you and he had some sort of agreement as to what Righ and Wrong are...","My idea of God is a not divine idea. It has to be shattered from time to time. He shatters it Himself. He is the great iconoclast. Could we not almost say that this shattering is one of the marks of His presence?..","Thirst was made for water; inquiry for truth","Joy is not a substitute for sex; sex is very often a substitute for Joy. I sometimes wonder whether all pleasures are not substitutes for Joy.","An odd by-product of my loss is that I\u2019m aware of being an embarrassment to everyone I meet. At work, at the club, in the street, I see people, as they approach me, trying to make up their minds whether they\u2019ll \u2018say something about it\u2019 or not. I hate it if they do, and if they don\u2019t. Some funk it altogether. R. has been avoiding me for a week. I like best the well brought-up young men, almost boys, who walk up to me as if I were a dentist, turn very red, get it over, and then edge away to the bar as quickly as they decently can. Perhaps the bereaved ought to be isolated in special settlements like lepers.","The home is the ultimate career. All other careers exist for one purpose, and that is to support the ultimate career.","I\u2019d rather be killed fighting for Narnia than grow old and stupid at home and perhaps go about in a bath-chair and then die in the end just the same.","For my own part, I tend to find the doctrinal books often more helpful in devotion than the devotional books, and I rather suspect that the same experience may await others. I believe that many who find that \u2018nothing happens\u2019 when they sit down, or kneel down, to a book of devotion, would find that the heart sings unbidden while they are working their way through a tough bit of theology with a pipe in their teeth and a pencil in their hand.","The dream is ended- this is the morning.","An unliterary man may be defined as one who reads books once only. . . . We do not enjoy a story fully at the first reading. Not till the curiosity, the sheer narrative lust, has been given its sop and laid asleep, are we at leisure to savour the real beauties. Till then, it is like wasting great wine on a ravenous natural thirst which merely wants cold wetness.","Don\'t bother too much about your feelings. When they are humble, loving, brave, give thanks for them; when they are conceited, selfish, cowardly, ask to have them altered. In neither case are they you, but only a thing that happens to you. What matters is your intentions and your behavior","He had no faintest conception till that very hour of how they would look, and even doubted their existence. But when he saw them he knew that he had always known them and realized what part each one of them had played at many an hour in his life when he had supposed himself alone, so that now he could say to them, one by one, not \u2018Who are you?\u2019 but \u2018So it was you all the time.\u2019 All that they were and said at this meeting woke memories. The dim consciousness of friends about him which had haunted his solitudes from infancy was now at last explained; that central music in every pure experience which had always just evaded memory was now at last recovered...He saw not only Them; he saw Him. This animal, this thing begotten in a bed, could look on Him. What is blinding, suffocating fire to you is now cool light to him, is clarity itself, and wears the form of a man.","A noble friend is the best gift. A noble enemy is the next best.","But, for a Christian, there are, strictly speaking, no chances. A secret Master of the Ceremonies has been at work. Christ, who said to the disciples \\"Ye have not chosen me, but I have chosen you,\\" can truly say to every group of Christian friends \\"You have not chosen one another but I have chosen you for one another.\\" The Friendship is not a reward for our discrimination and good taste in finding one another out. It is the instrument by which God reveals to each the beauties of all the others. They are no greater than the beauties of a thousand other men; by Friendship God opens our eyes to them. They are, like all beauties, derived from Him through the Friendship itself, so that it is His instrument for creating as well as for revealing. At this feast it is He who has spread the board and it is He who has chosen the guests. It is He, we may dare to hope, who sometimes does, and always should, preside. Let us not reckon without our Host.","Well done, last of the Kings of Narnia, who stood firm at the darkest hour.","Lead us not into temptation\' often means, among other things, \'Deny me those gratifying invitations, those highly interesting contacts, that participation in the brilliant movements of our age, which I so often, at such risk, desire.\'Reflections on the Psalms, ch 7","The First [Friend] is the alter ego, the man who first reveals to you that you are not alone in the world by turning out (beyond hope) to share all your most secret delights. There is nothing to be overcome in making him your friend; he and you join like raindrops on a window. But the Second Friend is the man who disagrees with you about everything. He is not so much the alter ego as the antiself. Of course he shares your interests; otherwise he would not become your friend at all. But he has approached them all at a different angle. He has read all the right books but has got the wrong thing out of every one. It is as if he spoke your language but mispronounced it. How can he be so nearly right and yet, invariably, just not right? He is as fascinating (and infuriating) as a woman. When you set out to correct his heresies, you will find that he forsooth to correct yours! And then you go at it, hammer and tongs, far into the night, night after night, or walking through fine country that neither gives a glance to, each learning the weight of the other\'s punches, and often more like mutually respectful enemies than friends. Actually (though it never seems so at the time) you modify one another\'s thought; out of this perpetual dogfight a community of mind and a deep affection emerge.","I am progressing along the path of life in my ordinary contentedly fallen and godless condition, absorbed in a merry meeting with my friends for the morrow or a bit of work that tickles my vanity today, a holiday or a new book, when suddenly a stab of abdominal pain that threatens serious disease, or a headline in the newspapers that threatens us all with destruction, sends this whole pack of cards tumbling down. At first I am overwhelmed, and all my little happinesses look like broken toys. Then, slowly and reluctantly, bit by bit, I try to bring myself into the frame of mind that I should be in at all times. I remind myself that all these toys were never intended to possess my heart, that my true good is in another world, and my only real treasure is Christ. And perhaps, by God\'s grace, I succeed, and for a day or two become a creature consciously dependent on God and drawing its strength from the right sources.","The greatest barrier I have met is the almost total absence from the minds of my audience of any sense of sin... The early Christian preachers could assume in their hearers, whether Jews, Metuentes, or Pagans, a sense of guilt. (That this was common among Pagans is shown by the fact that both Epicureanism and the mystery religions both claimed, though in different ways, to assuage it.) Thus the Christian message was in those days unmistakably the Evangelium, the Good News. It promised healing to those who knew they were sick. We have to convince our hearers of the unwelcome diagnosis before we can expect them to welcome the news of the remedy.The ancient man approached God (or even the gods) as the accused person approaches his judge. For the modern man, the roles are quite reversed. He is the judge: God is in the dock. He is quite a kindly judge; if God should have a reasonable defense for being the god who permits war, poverty, and disease, he is ready to listen to it. The trial may even end in God\u2019s acquittal. But the important thing is that man is on the bench and God is in the dock.","I think I am beginning to understand why grief feels like suspense. It comes from the frustration of so many impulses that had become habitual. Thought after thought feeling after feeling, action after action, had H. for their object. Now their target is gone. I keep on through habit fitting an harrow to the string, then I remember and have to lay the bow down. So many roads lead thought to H. I set out on one of them. But now there\'s an impassable frontierpost across it. So many roads once; now so many culs de sac.","I have said that she had no face; but that meant she had a thousand faces","There are no real personalities apart from God. Until you have given up your self to Him you will not have a real self. Sameness is to be found most among the most \'natural\' men, not among those who surrender to Christ. How monotonously alike all the great tyrants and conquerers have been; how gloriously different are the saints.But there must be a real giving up of the self. You must throw it away \'blindly\' so to speak. Christ will indeed give you a real personality; but you must not go to Him for the sake of that. As long as your own personality is what you are bothering about you are not going to Him at all. The very first step is to try to forget about the self altogether. Your real, new self (which is Christ\'s and also yours, and yours just because it is His) will not come as long as you are looking for it. It will come when you are looking for Him...Keep back nothing. Nothing that you have not given away will be really yours. Nothing in you that has not died will ever be raised from the dead. Look for yourself, and you will find in the long run only hatred, loneliness, despair, rage, ruin, and decay. But look for Christ, and you will find Him, and with Him everything else thrown in.","They would say, he answered, \u201cthat you do not fail in obedience through lack of love, but have lost love because you never attempted obedience.\u201d","I think I can understand that feeling about a housewife\u2019s work being like that of Sisyphus (who was the stone rolling gentleman). But it is surely in reality the most important work in the world. What do ships, railways, miners, cars, government etc exist for except that people may be fed, warmed, and safe in their own homes? As Dr. Johnson said, \u201cTo be happy at home is the end of all human endeavour. (1st to be happy to prepare for being happy in our own real home hereafter: 2nd in the meantime to be happy in our houses.) We wage war in order to have peace, we work in order to have leisure, we produce food in order to eat it. So your job is the one for which all others exist\u2026\u201d","But who is Aslan? Do you know him?\\"\\"Well-he knows me,\\" said Edmund. \\"He is the great Lion, the son of the Emperor-beyond-the-Sea, who saved me and saved Narnia.","We use a most unfortunate idiom when we say, of a lustful man prowling the streets, that he \\"wants a woman\\". Strictly speaking, a woman is just what he does not want. He wants a pleasure for which a woman happens to be the necessary piece of apparatus. How much he cares about the woman as such may be gauged by his attitude for her five minutes after fruition.","Where men are forbidden to honour a king they honour millionaires, athletes, or film-stars instead: even famous prostitutes or gangsters. For spiritual nature, like bodily nature, will be served; deny it food and it will gobble poison.","You can\u2019t see anything properly while your eyes are blurred with tears. You can\u2019t, in most things, get what you want if you want it too desperately: anyway, you can\u2019t get the best out of it.","If you want to get warm you must stand near the fire: if you want to be wet you must get into the water. If you want joy, power, peace, eternal life, you must get close to, or even into, the thing that has them.","If we consider the unblushing promises of reward \u2026 promised in the Gospels, it would seem that our Lord finds our desires not too strong, but too weak. We are half-hearted creatures, fooling about with drink and sex and ambition when infinite joy is offered us, like an ignorant child who wants to go on making mud pies in a slum because he cannot imagine what is meant by the offer of a holiday at sea. We are far too easily pleased.","By starving the sensibility of our pupils we only make them easier prey to the propagandist when he comes. For famished nature will be avenged and a hard heart is no infallible protection against a soft head.","we begin to notice besides our particular sinful act, our sinfulness; begin to be alarmed not only about what we do, but about what we are. This may sound rather difficult, so I will try to make it clear from my own case. When I come to my evening prayers and try to reckon up the sins of the day, nine times out of ten the most obvious one is some sin against charity; I have sulked or snapped or sneered or snubbed or stormed. And the excuse that immediately springs to my mind is that the provocation was so sudden and unexpected; I was caught off my guard, I had not time to collect myself. Now that may be an extenuating circumstance as regards those particular acts: they would obviously be worse if they had been deliberate and premeditated. On the other hand, surely what a man does when he is taken off his guard is the best evidence for what sort of a man he is? Surely what pops out before the man has time to put on a disguise is the truth? If there are rats in the cellar you are most likely to see them if you go in very suddenly. But the suddenness does not creat the rats: it only prevents them from hiding. In the same way the suddenness of the provocation does not make me an ill-tempered man; it only shows me what an ill-tempered man I am. The rats are always there in the cellar, but if you go in shouting and noisily they will have taken cover before you switch on the light.","You can never be really sure of how much you believe anything until its truth or falsehood becomes a matter of life or death to you.","The best is perhaps what we understand the least.","Even in your hobbies, has there not always been some secret attraction which the others are curiously ignorant of--something, not to be identified with, but always on the verge of breaking through, the smell of cut wood in the workshop or the clap-clap of water against the boat\'s side? Are not all lifelong friendships born at the moment when at last you meet another human being who has some inkling (but faint and uncertain even in the best) of that something which you were born desiring, and which, beneath the flux of other desires and in all the momentary silences between the louder passions, night and day, year by year, from childhood to old age, you are looking for, watching for, listening for? You have never had it. All the things that have ever deeply possesed your soul have been but hints of it--tantalizing glimspes, promises never quite fulfilled, echoes that died away just as they caught your ear. But if it should really become manifest--if there ever came an echo that did not die away but swelled into the sound itself--you would know it. Beyond all possibility of doubt you would say \'Here at last is the thing I was made for.\' We cannot tell each other about it. It is the secret signature of each soul, the incommunicable and unappeasable want, the things we desired before we met our wives or made our friends or chose our work, and which we shall still desire on our deathbeds, when the mind no longer knows wife or friend or work. While we are, this is. If we lose this, we lose all.","The first demand any work of art makes upon us is surrender. Look. Listen. Receive. Get yourself out of the way. (There is no good asking first whether the work before you deserves such a surrender, for until you have surrendered you cannot possibly find out.)","Let us go on and take the adventures that shall fall to us.","But those two circles, above all the point at which they touched, are the very thing I am mourning for, homesick for, famished for. You tell me \'she goes on.\' But my heart and body are crying out, come back, come back. Be a circle, touching my circle on the plane of Nature. But I know this is impossible. I know that the thing I want is exactly the thing I can never get.","But Ransom, as time wore on, became aware of another and more spiritual cause for his progressive lightening and exultation of heart. A nightmare, long engendered in the modern mind by the mythology that follows in the wake of science, was falling off him. He had read of \'Space\': at the back of his thinking for years had lurked the dismal fancy of the black, cold vacuity, the utter deadness, which was supposed to separate the worlds. He had not known how much it affected him till now-now that the very name \'Space\' seemed a blasphemous libel for this empyrean ocean of radiance in which they swam. He could not call it \'dead\'; he felt life pouring into him from it every moment. How indeed should it be otherwise, since out of this ocean all the worlds and all their life had come? He had thought it barren: he now saw that it was the womb of worlds, whose blazing and innumerable offspring looked down nightly even upon the earth with so many eyes-and here, with how many more! No: Space was the wrong name.","It is not for nothing that you are named Ransom, said the Voice...The whole distinction between things accidental and things designed, like the distinction between fact and myth, was purely terrestrial. The pattern is so large that within the little frame of earthly experience there appear pieces of it between which we can see no connection, and other pieces between which we can. Hence we rightly, for our sue, distinguish the accidental from the essential. But step outside that frame and the distinction drops down into the void, fluttering useless wings. He had been forced out of the frame, caught up into the larger pattern\u2026 \u201cMy name also is Ransom,\u201d said the Voice.\u201d","It is because they have no Oyarsa,\' said one of the pupils.It is because everyone of them wants to be a little Oyarsa himself,\' said Augray.","Q. What is your view of the daily discipline of the Christian life - the need for taking time to be alone with God?Lewis: \\"We have our New Testament regimental orders upon the subject. I would take it for granted that everyone who becomes a Christian would undertake this practice. It is enjoined upon us by Our Lord; and since they are his commands, I believe in following them. It is always just possible that Jesus Christ meant what he said when He told us to seek the secret place and to close the door.","After each failure, ask forgiveness, pick yourself up, and try again. Very often what God first helps us towards is not the virtue itself but just this power of always trying again.","Science works by experiments. It watches how things behave. Every scientific statement in the long run, however complicated it looks, really means something like, \'I pointed the telescope to such and such a part of the sky at 2:20 a.m. on January 15th and saw so-and-so,\' or, \'I put some of this stuff in a pot and heated it to such-and-such a temperature and it did so-and-so.\' Do not think I am saying anything against science: I am only saying what its job is.And the more scientific a man is, the more (I believe) he would agree with me that this is the job of science--and a very useful and necessary job it is too. But why anything comes to be there at all, and whether there is anything behind the things science observes--something of a different kind--this is not a scientific question. If there is \'Something Behind,\' then either it will have to remain altogether unknown to men or else make itself known in some different way. The statement that there is any such thing, and the statement that there is no such thing, are neither of them statements that science can make. And real scientists do not usually make them. It is usually the journalists and popular novelists who have picked up a few odds and ends of half-baked science from textbooks who go in for them. After all, it is really a matter of common sense. Supposing science ever became complete so that it knew every single thing in the whole universe. Is it not plain that the questions, \'Why is there a universe?\' \'Why does it go on as it does?\' \'Has it any meaning?\' would remain just as they were?","There is always the danger that those who think alike should gravitate together into \u2018coteries\u2019 where they will henceforth encounter opposition only in the emasculated form of rumor that the outsiders say thus and thus. The absent are easily refuted, complacent dogmatism thrives, and differences of opinion are embittered by group hostility. Each group hears not the best, but the worst, that the other groups can say.","In other words,\\" it continued, \\"you can\'t ride. That\'s a drawback. I\'ll have to teach you as we go along. If you can\'t ride, can you fall?\\"\\"I suppose anyone can fall,\\" said Shasta.\\"I mean can you fall and get up again without crying and mount again and fall again and yet not be afraid of falling?","Christ says, \\"Give me All. I don\'t want so much of your time and so much of your money and so much of your work: I want You. I have not come to torment your natural self, but to kill it. No half-measures are any good...Hand over the whole natural self, all the desires which you think innocent as well as the ones you think wicked--the whole outfit. I will give you a new self instead. In fact, I will give you Myself: my own will shall become yours.","If you look upon ham and eggs and lust, you have already committed breakfast in your heart.","When Aslan Bears his teeth winter meets its death. When he shakes his mane, we shall have spring again.","I see you are an idiot, whatever else you may be...","I was driven to Whipsnade one sunny morning. When we set out I did not believe that Jesus Christ is the son of God, and when we reached the zoo I did. Yet I had not exactly spent the journey in thought. Nor in great emotion. \u201cEmotional is perhaps the last word we can apply to some of the most important events. It was more like when a man, after a long sleep, still lying motionless in bed, becomes aware that he is now awake.\u201d","As long as what you are afraid of is something evil, you may still hope that the good may come to your rescue. But suppose you struggle through to the good and find that it is also dreadful? How if food itself turns out to be the very thing you can\u2019t eat and home the very place you can\u2019t live, and your very comforter the person who makes you uncomfortable. Then, indeed, there is no rescue possible: the last card has been played.","Telling us to obey instinct is like telling us to obey \'people.\' People say different things: so do instincts. Our instincts are at war. If it is held that the instinct for preserving the species should always be obeyed at the expense of other instincts, whence do we derive this rule of precedence? To listen to that instinct speaking in its own case and deciding in its own favour would be rather simple minded. Each instinct, if you listen to it, will claim to be gratified at the expense of all the rest. By the very act of listening to one rather than to others we have already prejudged the case. If we did not bring to the examination of our instincts a knowledge of their comparative dignity we could never learn it from them. And that knowledge cannot itself be instinctive: the judge cannot be one of the parties judged: or, if he is, the decision is worthless and there is no ground for placing preservation of the species above self-preservation or sexual appetite.","I sometimes wonder if all pleasures are not substitutes for joy.","Nothing, I suspect, is more astonishing in any man\'s life than the discovery that there do exist people very, very like himself.","Of course, I quiet agree that the Christian religion is, in the long run, a thing of unspeakable discomfort. But it does not begin in comfort; it begins in the dismay and it is no use at all trying to go on to that comfort without first going through that dismay. In religion, as in war and everything else, comfort is one thing you cannot get looking for it. If you look for the truth, you may find comfort in the end: if you look for comfort you will not get either comfort or truth-only soft soap and wishful thinking to begin with and the in the end, despair.","I am almost inclined to set it up as a canon that a children\'s story which is enjoyed only by children is a bad children\'s story.","Suppose that the earthly lives she and I shared for a few years are in reality only the basis for, or prelude to, or earthly appearance of, two unimaginable, supercosmic, eternal somethings.","Already the new men are dotted here and there all over the earth. Some, as I have admitted, are still hardly recognisable: but others can be recognised. Every now and then one meets them. Their very voices and faces are different from ours: stronger, quieter, happier, more radiant. They begin where most of us leave off. They are, I say, recognisable; but you must know what to look for. They will not be very like the idea of \u2018religious people\u2019 which you have formed from your general reading. They do not draw attention to themselves. You tend to think that you are being kind to them when they are really being kind to you. They love you more than other men do, but they need you less. (We must get over wanting to be NEEDED: in some goodish people, specially women, that is the hardest of all temptations to resist.) They will usually seem to have a lot of time: you will wonder where it comes from. When you have recognised one of them, you will recognise the next one much more easily. And I strongly suspect (but how should I know?) that they recognise one another immediately and infallibly, across every barrier of colour, sex, class, age, and even of creeds. In that way, to become holy is rather like joining a secret society. To put it at the very lowest, it must be great fun","If you run now, without a moment\'s rest, you will still be in time to warn King Lune.\\"Shasta\'s heart fainted at these words for he felt he had no strength left. And he writhed inside at what seemed the cruelty and unfairness of the demand. He had not yet learned that if you do one good deed your reward usually is to be set to do another and harder and better one. But all he said out loud was:\\"Where is the King?\\"The Hermit turned and pointed with his staff. \\"Look,\\" he said. \\"There is another gate, right opposite to the one you entered by. Open it and go straight ahead: always straight ahead, over level or steep, over smooth or rough, over dry or wet. I know by my art that you will find King Lune straight ahead. But run, run: always run.","suffering is not good in itself. What is good in any painful experience is, for the sufferer, his submission to the will of God, and, for the spectators, the compassion aroused and the acts of mercy to which it leads.","When you have reached your own room, be kind to those who have chosen different doors and to those who are still in the hall. If they are wrong they need your prayers all the more; and if they are your enemies, then you are under orders to pray for them. That is one of the rules common to the whole house.","My dear young lady,\' said the professor...\'there is one plan which no one has yet suggested and which is well worth trying.\'\'What\'s that?\' said Susan.\'We might all try minding our own business...","The devil always sends errors into the world in pairs--pairs of opposites. And he always encourages us to spend a lot of time thinking which is the worse. You see why, of course? He relies on your extra dislike of the one error to draw you gradually into the opposite one.","Friend, I am not suggesting at all. You see, I know now. Let us be frank. Our opinions were not honestly come by. We simply found ourselves in contact with a certain current of ideas and plunged into it because it seemed modern and successful. At College, you know, we just started automatically writing the kind of essays that got good marks and saying the kind of things that won applause. When, in our whole lives, did we honestly face, in solitude, the one question on which all turned: whether after all the Supernatural might not in fact occur? When did we put up one moment\'s real resistance to the loss of our faith?","Be comforted, small one, in your smallness. He lays no merit on you. Receive and be glad.","Friendship is the greatest of worldly goods. Certainly to me it is the chief happiness of life. If I had to give a piece of advice to a young man about a place to live, I think I should say, \'sacrifice almost everything to live where you can be near your friends.","If a thing is free to be good it is also free to be bad. And free will is what has made evil possible. Why, then, did God give them free will? Because free will, though it makes evil possible, is also the only thing that makes possible any love or goodness or joy worth having. A world of automata--of creatures that worked like machines--would hardly be worth creating. The happiness which God designs for His higher creatures is the happiness of being freely, voluntarily united to Him and to each other in an ecstasy of love and delight compared with which the most rapturous love between a man and a woman on this earth is mere milk and water. And for that they must be free.","Lucy buried her head in his mane to hide from his face. But there must have been some magic in his mane. She could feel lion-strength going into her. Quite suddenly she sat up. \\"I\'m sorry, Aslan,\\" she said. \\"I\'m ready now.\\"\\"Now you are a lioness,\\" said Aslan. \\"And now all Narnia will be renewed.","Friendship is unnecessary, like philosophy, like art, like the universe itself (for God did not need to create). It has no survival value; rather it is one of those things which give value to survival. p.71\u201cAffection is taken as the image when God is represented as our Father; Eros, when Christ is represented as the Bridegroom of the Church.\u201d p.78\u201cThe little pockets of early Christians survived because they cared exclusively for the love of \u201cthe brethren\u201d and stopped their ears to the opinion of the Pagan society all around them.\u201d p.70\u201cFriendship is even, if you like, angelic. But man needs to be triply protected by humility if he is to eat the bread of angels without risk.\u201d p.87\u201d","Do not imagine that if you meet a really humble man he will be what most people call \'humble\' nowadays: he will not be a sort of greasy, smarmy person, who is always telling you that, of course, he is nobody.Probably all you will think about him is that he seemed a cheerful, intelligent chap who took a real interest in what you said to him.If you do dislike him it will be because you feel a little envious of anyone who seems to enjoy life so easily. He will not be thinking about humility: he will not be thinking about himself at all.","The use of fashions in thought is to distract men from their real dangers. We direct the fashionable outcry of each generation against those vices of which it is in the least danger, and fix its approval on the virtue that is nearest the vice which we are trying to make endemic. The game is to have them all running around with fire extinguishers whenever there\u2019s a flood; and all crowding to that side of the boat which is already nearly gone under.","The most intense joy, lies not in the having, but in the desire,Delight that never fades, bliss that is eternal,Is only your, when what you most desire, is just out of reach...Anthony Hopkins, from the movie Shadowlands, where he plays C.S. Lewis","Murder! Fascists! Lions! It isn\'t fair.","You will never make a good impression on other people until you stop thinking about what sort of impression you are making. Even in literature and art, no man who bothers about originality will ever be original: whereas if you simply try to tell the truth (without caring twopence how often it has been told before) you will, nine times out of ten, become original without ever having noticed it... Give up yourself, and you will find your real self.","Aslan didn\'t tell Pole what would happen. He only told her what to do. That fellow will be the death of us once he\'s up, I shouldn\'t wonder. But that doesn\'t let us off following the signs.","As he rose to his feet he noticed that he was neither dripping nor panting for breath as anyone would expect after being under water. His clothes were perfectly dry. He was standing by the edge of a small pool\u2014not more than ten feet from side to side in a wood. The trees grew close together and were so leafy that he could get no glimpse of the sky. All the light was green light that came through the leaves: but there must have been a very strong sun overhead, for this green daylight was bright and warm. It was the quietest wood you could possibly imagine. There were no birds, no insects, no animals, and no wind. You could almost feel the trees growing. The pool he had just got out of was not the only pool. There were dozens of others\u2014a pool every few yards as far as his eyes could reach. You could almost feel the trees drinking the water up with their roots. This wood was very much alive.","But he always liked to get visitors alone in the billiard room and tell them stories about a mysterious lady, a foreign royalty, with whom he had driven about London. \'A devilish temper she had,\' he would say. \'But she was a dem fine woman, sir, a dem fine woman.","The universe is so very complicated,\\" said Dr Dimble.\\"So you have said rather often before, dear,\\" replied Mrs Dimble \\"Have I?\\" he said with a smile. \\"How often, I wonder? As often as you\'ve told the story of the pony and trap at Dawlish?\\"\\"Cecil! I haven\'t told it for years.\\"\\"My dear, I heard you telling it to Camilla the night before last.\\"\\"Oh, Camilla! That was quite different. She\'d never heard it before.\\"\\"I don\'t know if we can even be certain about that...the universe being so complicated and all.\\" For a few minutes there was silence between them.\\"But about Merlin?\\" asked Mrs Dimble presently.\\"Have you ever noticed,\\" said Dimble,\\" that the universe, and every little bit of the universe, is always hardening and narrowing and coming to a point?\\"His wife waited as those wait who know by long experience the mental processes of the person who is talking to them.\\"I mean this,\\" said Dimble, answering the question she had not asked. \\"If you dip into any college, or school, or parish, or family\u2014anything you like\u2014at a given point in its history, you always find that there was a time before that point when there was more elbow room and contrasts weren\'t quite so sharp; and that there\'s going to be a time after that point when there is even less room for indecision and choices are even more momentous. Good is always getting better and bad is always getting worse: the possibilities of even apparent neutrality are always diminishing.","The more we believe that God hurts only to heal, the less we can believe that there is any use in begging for tenderness. A cruel man might be bribed...But suppose that what you are up against is a surgeon whose intentions are wholly good. The kinder and more conscientious he is, the more inexorably he will go on cutting. If he yielded to your entreaties, if he stopped before the operation was complete, all the pain up to that point would have been useless. But is it credible that such extremities of torture should be necessary for us? Well, take your choice. The tortures occur. If they are unnecessary, then there is no God or a bad one. If there is a good God, then these tortures are necessary. For no even moderately good Being could possibly inflict or permit them if they weren\'t. Either way, we\'re for it.","We are all receiving Charity. There is something in each of us that cannot benaturally loved.","Where Maleldil is, there is the centre. He is in every place. Not some of Him in one place and some in another, but in each place the whole Maleldil, even in the smallness beyond though. There is no way out of the centre save into the Bent Will which casts itself into the Nowhere. Blessed be He! Each thing was made for Him. He is the centre. Because we are with Him, each of us is at the centre...In His city all things are made for each. When He died in the Wonded World He died not for men, but for each man. If each mad had been the only man made, He would have done no less. Each thing, from the single grain of Dust to the strongest eldil, is the end and the final cause of all creation and the mirror in which the beam of His brightness comes to rest and so returns to Him. Blessed be He!","Tirian, with his head against Jewel\'s flank, slept as soundly as if he were in his royal bed at Cair Paravel, till the sound of a gong beating awoke him and he sat up and saw that there was firelight on the far side of the stable and knew that the hour had come. \\"Kiss me, Jewel,\\" he said. \\"For certainly this is our last night on earth. And if ever I offended against you in any matter great or small, forgive me now.\\"\\"Dear King,\\" said the Unicorn, \\"I could almost wish you had, so that I might forgive it. Farewell. We have known great joys together. If Aslan gave me my choice I would choose no other life than the life I have had and no other death than the one we go to.","That\u2019s true to life.Part of every misery is, so to speak, the misery\u2019s shadow orreflection: the fact that you don\u2019t merely suffer but have to keep onthinking about the fact that you suffer.","My good Horse,\\" said the Hermit, who had approached them unnoticed because his bare feet made so little noise on that sweet, dewy grass. \\"My good Horse, you\'ve lost nothing but your self-conceit. No, no, cousin. Don\'t put back your ears and shake your mane at me. If you are really so humbled as you sounded a minute ago, you must learn to listen to sense. You\'re not quite the great Horse you had come to think, from living among poor dumb horses. Of course you were braver and cleverer than them. You could hardly help being that. It doesn\'t follow that you\'ll be anyone very special in Narnia. But as long as you know you\'re nobody very special, you\'ll be a very decent sort of Horse, on the whole, and taking one thing with another.","The sense that in this universe we are treated as strangers, the longing to be acknowledged, to meet with some response, to bridge some chasm that yawns between us and reality, is part of our inconsolable secret. And surely, from this point of view, the promise of glory, in the sense described, becomes highly relevant to our deep desire. For glory means good report with God, acceptance by God, response, acknowledgment, and welcome into the heart of things. The door on which we have been knocking all our lives will open at last.","I wish she would grow up. She wasted all her school time wanting to be the age she is now, and she\'ll waste all the rest of her life trying to stay that age. He whole idea is to race on to the silliest time of one\'s life as quick as she can and then stop there as long as she can.","Three hundred years ago people in England were putting witches to death. Was that what you call the \'Rule of Human Nature or Right Conduct?\u2019 But surely the reason we do not execute witches is that we do not believe there are such things. If we did\u2014if we really thought that there were people going about who had sold themselves to the devil and received supernatural powers from him in return and were using these powers to kill their neighbours or drive them mad or bring bad weather\u2014surely we would all agree that if anyone deserved the death penalty, then these filthy quislings did? There is no difference of moral principle here: the difference is simply about matter of fact. It may be a great advance in knowledge not to believe in witches: there is no moral advance in not executing them when you do not think they are there. You would not call a man humane for ceasing to set mousetraps if he did so because he believed there were no mice in the house.","Tu-whoo! Ahem! Lord Regent,\\" said the Owl, stooping down a little and holding its beak near the Dwarf\'s ear.  \\"Heh? What\'s that?\\" said the Dwarf. \\"Two strangers, my Lord,\\" said the Owl. \\"Rangers! What d\'ye mean?\\" said the Dwarf. \\"I see two uncommonly grubby man-cubs. What do they want?\\" \\"My name\'s Jill,\\" said Jill, pressing forward. She was very eager to explain the important business on which they had come. \\"The girl\'s called Jill,\\" said the Owl, as loud as it could. \\"What\'s that?\\" said the Dwarf. \\"The girls are all killed! I don\'t believe a word of it. What girls? Who killed \'em?\\" \\"Only one girl, my Lord,\\" said the Owl. \\"Her name is Jill.\\" \\"Speak up, speak up,\\" said the Dwarf. \\"Don\'t stand there buzzing and twittering in my ear. Who\'s been killed?\\" \\"Nobody\'s been killed,\\" hooted the Owl. \\"Who?\\" \\"NOBODY.\\" \\"All right, all right. You needn\'t shout. I\'m not so deaf as all that. What do you mean by coming here to tell me that nobody\'s been killed? Why should anyone have been killed?\\" \\"Better tell him I\'m Eustace,\\" said Scrubb. \\"The boy\'s Eustace, my Lord,\\" hooted the Owl as loud as it could. \\"Useless?\\" said the Dwarf irritably. \\"I dare say he is. Is that any reason for bringing him to court? Hey?\\" \\"Not useless,\\" said the Owl. \\"EUSTACE.\\" \\"Used to it, is he? I don\'t know what you\'re talking about, I\'m sure. I\'ll tell you what it is, Master Glimfeather; when I was a young Dwarf there used to be talking beasts and birds in this country who really could talk. There wasn\'t all this mumbling and muttering and whispering. It wouldn\'t have been tolerated for a moment, Sir. Urnus, my trumpet please-","Be sure that the ins and outs of your individuality are no mystery to Him; and one day they will no longer be a mystery to you...God will look to every soul like its first love because He is its first love. Your place in heaven will seem to be made for you and you alone, because you were made for it--made for it stitch by stitch as a glove is made for a hand.","Has not one of the poets said that a noble friend is the best gift and a noble enemy the next best?","Shut your mouth; open your eyes and ears. Take in what is there and give no thought to what might have been there or what is somewhere else. That can come later, if it must come at all. (And notice here how the true training for anything whatever that is good always prefigures and, if submitted to, will always help us in, the true training for the Christian life)","You die and you die and then you are beyond death.","Everything becomes more and more itself. Here is joy that cannot be shaken. Our light can swallow up your darkness; but your darkness cannot now infect our light.","Keep his mind on the inner life. He thinks his conversion is something inside him, and his attention is therefore chiefly turned at present to the state of his own mind--or rather to that very expurgated version of them which is all you should allow him to see. Encourage this. Keep his mind off the most elementary duties of directing it to the most advanced and spiritual ones. Aggravate the most useful human characteristics, the horror and neglect of the obvious. You must bring him to a condition in which he can practise self-examination for an hour without discovering any of those facts about himself which are perfectly clear to anyone who has ever lived in the same house with him or worked in the same office.2. It is, no doubt, impossible to prevent his praying for his mother, but we have means of rendering the prayers innocuous. Make sure that they are always very \'spiritual\', that is is always concerned with the state of her soul and never with her rhuematism. Two advantages will follow. In the first place, his attention will be kept on what he regards are her sins, by which, with a little guidance from you, he can be induced to mean any of her actions which are inconvenient or irritating to himself. Thus you can keep rubbing the wounds of the day a little sorer even while he is on his knees; the operation is not at all difficult and you will find it very entertaining. In the second place, since his ideas about her soul will be very crude and often erroneous, he will, in some degree, be praying for an imaginary person, and it will be your task to make that imaginary person daily less and less like the real mother--the sharp-tongued old lady at the breakfast table. In time you may get the cleavage so wide that no thought or feeling from his prayers for the imagined mother will ever flow over into his treatment of the real one. I have had patients of my own so well in hand that they could be turned at a moment\'s notice from impassioned prayer for a wife\'s or son\'s soul to beating or insulting the real wife or son without any qualm.3. When two humans have lived together for many years it usually happens that each has tones of voice and expressions of face whice are almost unedurably irritating to the other. Work on that. Bring fully into the consciousness of your patient that particular lift of his mother\'s eyebrows which he learned to dislike in the nursery, and let him think how much he dislikes it. Let him assume that she knows how annoying it is and does it to annoy--if you know your job he will not notice the immense improbablity of the assumption. And, of course, never let him suspect that he has tones and looks which similarly annoy her. As he cannot see or hear himself, this is easily managed.","the fairy tale stirs and troubles him (to his life-long enrichment) with the dim sense of something beyond his reach and, far from dulling or emptying the actual world, gives it a new dimension of depth. He does not despise real woods because he has read of enchanted woods: The reading makes all real woods a little enchanted.","We have nothing if not belief.","She made beauty all round her. When she trod on mud, the mud was beautiful; when she ran in the rain, the rain was silver. When she picked up a toad - she had the strangest and, I thought, unchanciest love for all manner of brutes - the toad became beautiful.","If you read history you will find that the Christians begin the most for the present world are just the ones that thought the most of the next. The Apostles themselves, who set on foot. in the conversion of the Roman Empire, the great men who built up the Middle Ages, the English Evangelicals who abolished the Slave Trade, all left their mark one Earth, precisely because their minds were occupied with Heaven. It is since Christians have largely ceased to think of the other world that they have become so in effective in this. And that Heaven and you\'ll get the earth \\"thrown in\\": aim at earth and you\'ll get neither.","I would rather be what God chose to make me than the most glorious creature that I could think of; for to have been born in God\'s thought, and then made by God is the dearest, grandest, and most precious thing in all thinking.\\"This is a prayer of contentment","Meanwhile,\' said Mr Tumnus, \'it is winter in Narnia, and has been for ever so long, and we shall both catch cold if we stand here talking in the snow.

Only you and I in this land know that yet. Let us be good to one another.","a hard heart is no infallible protection against a soft head.","All Hell is smaller than one pebble of your earthly world: but it is smaller than one atom of this world, the Real World. Look at yon butterfly. If it swallowed all Hell, Hell would not be big enough to do it any harm or to have any taste\'\'It seems big enough when you\'re in it, Sir.\'\'And yet all loneliness, angers, hatreds, envies, and itchings that it contains, if rolled into one single experience and put into the scale against the least moment of the joy that is felt by the least in Heaven, would have no weight that could be registered at all. Bad cannot succeed even in being bad as truly as good is good. If all Hell\'s miseries together entered the consciousness of yon wee yellow bird on the bough there, they would be swallowed up without trace, as if one drop of ink had been dropped into that Great Ocean to which your terrestrial Pacific is only a molecule\'\'I see,\' said I at last. \'She couldn\'t fit into Hell.","You do not see as quite as well as you think.","That is why I often find myself at such cross-purposes with the modern world: I have been a converted Pagan living among apostate Puritans.","We do not want merely to see beauty, though, God knows, even that is bounty enough. We want something else which can hardly be put into words \u2014 to be united with the beauty we see, to pass into it, to receive it into ourselves, to bathe in it, to become part of it.","For in grief nothing \'stays put.\' One keeps on emerging from a phase, but it always recurs. Round and round. Everything repeats. Am I going in circles, or dare I hope I am on a spiral?","How wicked it would be, if we could, to call the dead back! She said not to me but to the chaplain, \'I am at peace with God.\' She smiled, but not at me. Poi si torno all\' eterna fontana.","Life is too deep for words, so don\'t try to describe it, just live it.Actually this quote doesn\'t sound like C.S. Lewis at all.

It is all one thing... what you call remembering is the last part of the pleasure.","And you must always remember there\'s one good thing about being trapped down here: it\'ll save funeral expenses.","Aristotle says that the aim of education is to make the pupil like and dislike what he ought.","That is the key to history. Terrific energy is expended - civilizations are built up - excellent institutions devised; but each time something goes wrong. Some fatal flaw always brings the selfish and the cruel people to the top and it all slides back into misery and ruin.","He cannot ravish; He can only woo.","There are two equal and opposite errors into which our race can fall about the devils. One is to disbelieve in their existence. The other is to believe, and to feel an excessive and unhealthy interest in them.","When they told him this, Ransom at last understood why mythology was what it was -- gleams of celestial strength and beauty falling on a jungle of filth and imbecility.","You have listened to fears, Child,\' said Aslan. \'Come, let me breathe on you.

Are you brave again?","Gratitude exclaims... \'How good of God to give me this.\' Adoration says, \'What must be the quality of that Being whose far-off and momentary coruscations are like this!\' One\'s mind runs back up the sunbeam to the sun.","Creatures are not born with desires unless satisfaction for those desires exists. A baby feels hunger: well, there is such a thing as food. A duckling wants to swim: well, there is such a thing as water. Men feel sexual desire: well, there is such a thing as sex. If I find in myself a desire which no experience in this world can satisfy, the most probable explanation is that I was made for another world. If none of my earthly pleasures satisfy it, that does not prove that the universe is a fraud. Probably earthly pleasures were never meant to satisfy it, but only to arouse it, to suggest the real thing. If that is so, I must take care, on the one hand, never to despise, or be unthankful for, these earthly blessings, and on the other, never to mistake them for the something else of which they are only a kind of copy, or echo, or mirage. I must keep alive in myself the desire for my true country, which I shall not find until after death; I must never let it get snowed under or turned aside; I must make it the main object of life to press on to that other country and to help others do the same.","The Happy Trinity is her home: nothing can trouble her joy.She is the bird that evades every net: the wild deer that leaps every pitfall.Like the mother bird to its chickens or a shield to the armed knight: so is the Lord to her mind, in His unchanging lucidity.Bogies will not scare her in the dark: bullets will not frighten her in the day.Falsehoods tricked out as truths assail her in vain: she sees through the lie as if it were glass.The invisible germ will not harm her: nor yet the glittering sunstroke.A thousand fail to solve the problem, ten thousand choose the wrong turning: but she passes safely through.He details immortal gods to attend her: upon every road where she must travel.They take her hand at hard places: she will not stub her toes in the dark.She may walk among lions and rattlesnakes: among dinosaurs and nurseries of lionettes.He fills her brim full with immensity of life: he leads her to see the world\u2019s desire.","Don\'t you think a dream would feel shy if it were seen walking about in the waking world?","In the name of the Father, and of the Son and of the Holy Ghost, here goes-I mean Amen.","If I discover within myself a desire which no experience in this world can satisfy, the most probable explanation is that I was made for another world.","He had turned into a dragon while he was asleep. Sleeping on a dragon\'s hoard with greedy, dragonish thoughts in his heart, he had become a dragon himself.","I had forgotten that you are only a common boy. How should you understand reasons of the State? You must learn, child, that what would be wrong for you or for any of the common people is not wrong in a great Queen such as I. The weight of the world is on our shoulders. We must be freed from all rules. Ours is a high and lonely destiny.","Straight tribulation is easier to bear than tribulation which advertises itself as pleasure.","God whispers to us in our pleasures, speaks in our conscience, but shouts in our pains.","Come, what do we gain by evasions? We are under the harrow and can\u2019t escape. Reality, looked at steadily, is unbearable. And how or why did such a reality blossom (or fester) here and there into the terrible phenomenon called consciousness? Why did it produce things like us who can see it and, seeing it, recoil in loathing? Who (stranger still) want to see it and take pains to find it out, even when no need compels them and even though the sight of it makes an incurable ulcer in their hearts? People like H. herself, who would have truth at any price.","The truest and most horrible claim made for modern transport is that it \u201cannihilates space. It does. It annihilates one of the most glorious gifts we have been given. It is a vile inflation which lowers the value of distance, so that a modern boy travels a hundred miles with less sense of liberation and pilgrimage and adventure than his grandfather got from traveling ten. Of course if a man hates space and wants it to be annihilated, that is another matter. Why not creep into his coffin at once? There is little enough space there.\u201d","The laws of the universe are never broken. Your mistake is to think that the little regularities we have observed on one planet for a few hundred years are the real unbreakable laws; whereas they are only the remote results which the true laws bring about more often than not; as a kind of accident.","On the rebound one passes into tears and pathos. Maudlin tears. I almost prefer the moments of agony. These are at least clean and honest. But the bath of self-pity, the wallow, the loathsome sticky-sweet pleasure of indulging it--that disgusts me","I, or any mortal at any time, may be utterly mistaken as to the situation he is really in.","Hush!\u2019 said the Cabby. They all listened.In the darkness something was happening at last. A voice had begun to sing. It was very far away and Digory found it hard to decide from what direction it was coming. Sometimes it seemed to come from all directions at once. Sometimes he almost thought it was coming out of the earth beneath them. Its lower notes were deep enough to be the voice of the earth herself. There were no words. There was hardly even a tune. But it was, beyond comparison, the most beautiful noise he had ever heard. It was so beautiful he could hardly bear it\u2026\u2018Gawd!\u2019 said the Cabby. \u2018Ain\u2019t it lovely?\u2019Then two wonders happened at the same moment. One was that the voice was suddenly joined by other voices; more voices than you could possibly count. They were in harmony with it, but far higher up the scale: cold, tingling, silvery voices. The second wonder was that the blackness overhead, all at once, was blazing with stars. They didn\u2019t come out gently one by one, as they do on a summer evening. One moment there had been nothing but darkness; next moment a thousand, thousand points of light leaped out \u2013 single stars, constellations, and planets, brighter and bigger than any in our world. There were no clouds. The new stars and the new voices began at exactly the same time. If you had seen and heard it , as Digory did, you would have felt quite certain that it was the stars themselves who were singing, and that it was the First Voice, the deep one, which had made them appear and made them sing.\u2018Glory be!\u2019 said the Cabby. \u2018I\u2019d ha\u2019 been a better man all my life if I\u2019d known there were things like this.\u2019\u2026Far away, and down near the horizon, the sky began to turn grey. A light wind, very fresh, began to stir. The sky, in that one place, grew slowly and steadily paler. You could see shapes of hills standing up dark against it. All the time the Voice went on singing\u2026The eastern sky changed from white to pink and from pink to gold. The Voice rose and rose, till all the air was shaking with it. And just as it swelled to the mightiest and most glorious sound it had yet produced, the sun arose.Digory had never seen such a sun\u2026You could imagine that it laughed for joy as it came up. And as its beams shot across the land the travellers could see for the first time what sort of place they were in. It was a valley through which a broad, swift river wound its way, flowing eastward towards the sun. Southward there were mountains, northward there were lower hills. But it was a valley of mere earth, rock and water; there was not a tree, not a bush, not a blade of grass to be seen. The earth was of many colours: they were fresh, hot and vivid. They made you feel excited; until you saw the Singer himself, and then you forgot everything else.It was a Lion. Huge, shaggy, and bright it stood facing the risen sun. Its mouth was wide open in song and it was about three hundred yards away.","Experience is the most brutal of teachers but you learn, my God, do you learn","But God will look to every soul like its first love because He is its first love. Your place in heaven will seem to be made for you and you alone, because you were made for it--made for it stitch by stitch as a glove is made for a hand.It is from this point of view that we can understand hell in its aspect of privation. All your life an unattainable ecstasy has hovered just beyond the grasp of your consciousness. The day is coming when you will wake to find, beyond all hope, that you have attained it, or else, that it was within your reach and you have lost it forever.","I think He made one law of that kind in order that there might be obedience. In all these other matters what you call obeying Him is but doing what seems good in your eyes also. Is love content with that? You do them, indeed, because they are His will, but not only because they are his will. Where can you taste the joy of obeying unless he bids you do something for which His bidding is the only reason?","Extraordinary things only happen to extraordinary people.","I thought ... that I was carried in the will of Him I love, but now I see that I walk with it. I thought that the good things He sent drew me into them as the waves lift the islands; but now I see that it is I who plunge into them with my own legs and arms, as when we go swimming. I feel as if I were living in that roofless world of [Earth] where men walk undefended beneath naked heaven. It is a delight with terror in it! One\'s own self to be walking from one good to another, walking beside Him as Himself may walk, not even holding hands. How has He made me so separate from Himself? How did it enter His mind to conceive such a thing? The world is so much larger than I thought. I thought we went along paths--but it seems there are no paths. The going itself is the path.","To see, in some measure, like God. His love and His knowledge are not distinct from one another, nor from Him. We could almost say He sees because He loves, and therefore loves although He sees.","But the greatest cause of verbicide is the fact that most people are obviously far more anxious to express their approval and disapproval of things than to describe them. Hence the tendency of words to become less descriptive and more evaluative; then become evaluative, while still retaining some hint of the sort of goodness or badness implied; and to end up by being purely evaluative -- useless synonyms for good or for bad.","Why is God landing in this enemy-occupied world in disguise and starting a sort of secret society to undermine the devil? Why is He not landing in force, invading it? Is it that He is not strong enough? Well, Christians think He is going to land in force; we do not know when. But we can guess why He is delaying. He wants to give us the chance of joining His side freely. I do not suppose you and I would have though much of a Frenchman who waited till the Allies were marching into Germany and then announced he was on our side. God will invade. But I wonder whether people who ask God to interfere openly and directly in our world quite realise what it will be like when He does. When that happens, it is the end of the world. When the author walks on to the stage the play is over. God is going to invade, all right: but what is the good of saying you are on His side then, when you see the whole natural universe melting away like a dream and something else -something it never entered your head to conceive- comes crasing in; something so beautiful to some of us and so terrible to others that none of us will have any choice left? For this time it will be God without disguise; something so overwhelming that it will strike either irresistible love or irresistible horror into every creature. It will be too late then to choose your side. There is no use saying you choose to lie down when it has become impossible to stand up. That will not be the time for choosing: it will be the time when we discover which side we really have chosen, whether we realised it before or not. Now, today, this moment, is our chance to choose the right side. God is holding back to give us that chance. It will not last forever. We must take it or leave it.","Puddleglum is the name. It doesn\'t matter if you forget it, I can always tell you again.","I suppose there are two views about everything, said Mark. \u201cEh? Two views? There are a dozen views about everything until you know the answer. Then there\u2019s never more than one.\u201d","Remember that there are only three kinds of things anyone need ever do. (1) Things we ought to do (2) Things we\'ve got to do (3) Things we like doing. I say this because some people seem to spend so much of their time doing things for none of these three reasons, things like reading books they don\'t like because other people read them.","His education had been neither scientific nor classical\u2014merely \u201cModern. The severities both of abstraction and of high human tradition had passed him by: and he had neither peasant shrewdness nor aristocratic honour to help him. He was a man of straw, a glib examinee in subjects that require no exact knowledge (he had always done well on Essays and General Papers) and the first hint of a real threat to his bodily life knocked him sprawling.\u201d","If you want to get warm you must stand near the fire: if you want to be wet you must get into the water. If you want joy, power, peace, eternal life, you must get close to, or even into, the thing that has them. They are not a sort of prize which God could, if He chose, hand out to anyone. They are a great fountain of energy and beauty spurting up at the very centre of reality. If you are close to it, the spray will wet you: if you are not,, you will remian dry. Once a man is united to God, how could he not live forever? Once a man is separated from God, what can he do but wither and die.","the trouble about trying to make yourself stupider than you really are is that you very often succeed.","We never find out the strength of the evil impulse inside us until we try to fight it: and Christ, because he was the only man who never yielded to temptation, is also the only man who knows to the full what temptation means.","The whole struggle was over, and yet there seemed to have been no moment of victory. You might say, if you liked, that the power of choice had been simply set aside and an inflexible destiny substituted for it. On the other hand, you might say he had delivered from the rhetoric of his passions and had emerged in unassailable freedom. Ransom could not for the life of him, see any difference between these two statements. Predestination and freedom were apparently identical. He could no longer see any meaning in the many arguments he had heart on the subject.","The longest way round is the shortest way home.(Quoting Alexander MacLaren, The Wearied Christ and Other Sermons)","Hardships often prepare ordinary people for an extraordinary destiny","We laugh at honor, and are shocked to find traitors in our midst.","He always knew that my temple was a house of cards. His only way of making me realize the fact was to knock it down.","The task of the modern educator is not to cut down jungles but to irrigate deserts.","I believe that any Christian who is qualified to write a good popular book on anyscience may do much more by that than by any direct apologetic work\u2026. We canmake people often attend to the Christian point of view for half an hour or so; butthe moment they have gone away from our lecture or laid down our article, theyare plunged back into a world where the opposite position is taken for granted\u2026.What we want is not more little books about Christianity, but more little books byChristians on other subjects\u2014with their Christianity latent. You can see this mosteasily if you look at it the other way around. Our faith is not very likely to beshaken by any book on Hinduism. But if whenever we read an elementary bookon Geology, Botany, Politics, or Astronomy, we found that its implications wereHindu, that would shake us. It is not the books written in direct defense ofMaterialism that make the modern man a materialist; it is the materialisticassumptions in all the other books. In the same way, it is not books onChristianity that will really trouble him. But he would be troubled if, whenever hewanted a cheap popular introduction to some science, the best work on themarket was always by a Christian.","My Dear Lucy,I wrote this story for you, but when I began it I had not realized that girls grow quicker than books. As a result you are already too old for fairy tales, and by the time it is printed and bound you will be older still. But some day you will be old enough to start reading fairy tales again.","For this reason, the question whether miracles occur can never be answered simply by experience. Every event which might claim to be a miracle is, in the last resort, something presented to our senses, something seen, heard, touched, smelled or tasted. And our senses are not infallible. If anything extraordinary seems to have happened, we can always say that we have been the victims of an illusion. If we hold a philosophy which excludes the supernatural, this is what we always shall say. What we learn from experience depends on the kind of philosophy we bring to experience. It is therefore useless to appeal to experience before we have settled, as well as we can, the philosophical question.","But I was wrong to weep and beg and try to force you by your love. Love is not a thing to be so used.","In one way we think a great deal too much of the atomic bomb. \u2018How are we to live in an atomic age?\u2019 I am tempted to reply: Why, as you would have lived in the sixteenth century when the plague visited London almost every year, or as you would have lived in a Viking age when raiders from Scandinavia might land and cut your throat any night; or indeed, as you are already living in an age of cancer, an age of syphilis, an age of paralysis, an age of air raids, an age of railway accidents, an age of motor accidents.\u2019In other words, do not let us begin by exaggerating the novelty of our situation. Believe me, dear sir or madam, you and all whom you love were already sentenced to death before the atomic bomb was invented: and quite a high percentage of us were going to die in unpleasant ways.We had, indeed, one very great advantage over our ancestors\u2014anesthetics; but we have that still. It is perfectly ridiculous to go about whimpering and drawing long faces because the scientists have added one more chance of painful and premature death to a world which already bristled with such chances\u2026 and in which death itself was not a chance at all, but a certainty.This is the first point to be made: and the first action to be taken is to pull ourselves together. If we are all going to be destroyed by an atomic bomb, let that bomb when it comes find us doing sensible and human things\u2014praying, working, teaching, reading, listening to music, bathing the children, playing tennis, chatting to our friends over a pint and a game of darts\u2014not huddled together like frightened sheep and thinking about bombs. They may break our bodies (a microbe can do that) but they need not dominate our minds.","God whispers to us in our pleasures, speaks in our conscience, but shouts in our pain: it is His megaphone to rouse a deaf world.","You can\'t go back and change the beginning but you can start where you are and change the ending.","All the books were beginning to turn against me. Indeed, I must have been blind as a bat not to have seen it long before, the ludicrous contradiction between my theory of life and my actual experiences as a reader. George MacDonald had done more to me than any other writer; of course it was a pity that he had that bee in his bonnet about Christianity. He was good in spite of it. Chesterton has more sense than all the other moderns put together; bating, of course, his Christianity. Johnson was one of the few authors whom I felt I could trust utterly; curiously enough, he had the same kink. Spenser and Milton by a strange coincidence had it too. Even among ancient authors the same paradox was to be found. The most religious (Plato, Aeschylus, Virgil) were clearly those on whom I could really feed. On the other hand, those writers who did not suffer from religion and with whom in theory my sympathy ought to have been complete -- Shaw and Wells and Mill and Gibbon and Voltaire -- all seemed a little thin; what as boys we called \\"tinny\\". It wasn\'t that I didn\'t like them. They were all (especially Gibbon) entertaining; but hardly more. There seemed to be no depth in them. They were too simple. The roughness and density of life did not appear in their books.","At present we are on the outside\u2026 the wrong side of the door. We discern the freshness and purity of morning, but they do not make us fresh and pure. We cannot mingle with the pleasures we see. But all the pages of the New Testament are rustling with the rumor that it will not always be so. Someday, God willing, we shall get \u201cin\u2026 We will put on glory\u2026 that greater glory of which Nature is only the first sketch.We do not want to merely \u201csee\u201d beauty -- though, God knows, even that is bounty enough. We want something else which can hardly be put into words\u2013to be united with the beauty we see, to pass into it, to receive it into ourselves, to bathe in it, to become part of it.\u201d","God can make good use of all that happens, but the loss is real.","If you read history you will find that the Christians who did most for the present world were just those who thought most of the next.","But sweat is the kindest creature of the three\u2014far better than philosophy, as a cure for ill thoughts.","I was the lion who forced you to join with Aravis. I was the cat who comforted you among the houses of the dead. I was the lion who drove the jackals from you while you slept. I was the lion who gave the Horses the new strength of fear for the last mile so that you should reach King Lune in time. And I was the lion you do not remember who pushed the boat in which you lay, a child near death, so that it came to shore where a man sat, wakeful at midnight, to receive you.","To know what would have happened, child? said Aslan. No. Nobody is ever told that.","If we are to use the words \u2018childish\u2019 and \u2018infantile\u2019 as terms of disapproval, we must make sure that they refer only to those characteristics of childhood which we become better and happier by outgrowing. Who in his sense would not keep, if he could, that tireless curiosity, that intensity of imagination, that facility of suspending disbelief, that unspoiled appetite, that readiness to wonder, to pity, and to admire?","One of the dangers of having a lot of money is that you may be quite satisfied with the kinds of happiness money can give, and so fail to realize your need for God. If everything seems to come simply by signing checks, you may forget that you are at every moment totally dependent on God. Now, quite plainly natural gifts carry with them a similar danger. If you have sound nerves and intelligence and health and popularity and a good upbringing, you are likely to be quite satisfied with your character as it is. \u201cWhy drag God into it? you may ask. A certain level of good conduct comes fairly easily to you. You are not one of those wretched creatures who are always being tripped up by sex or dipsomania or nervousness or bad temper. Everyone says you are a nice chap, and between ourselves, you agree with them. You are quite likely to believe that all this niceness is your own doing, and you may easily not feel the need for any better kind of goodness. Often people who have all these natural kinds of goodness cannot be brought to recognize their need for Christ at all until one day, the natural goodness lets them down, and their self-satisfaction is shattered. In other words, it is hard for those who are rich in this sense to enter the kingdom.\u201d","I was still young and the whole world of beauty was opening before me, my own officious obstructions were often swept aside and, startled into self-forgetfulness, I again tasted Joy. ... One thing, however, I learned, which has since saved me from many popular confusions of mind. I came to know by experience that it is not a disguise of sexual desire. ... I repeatedly followed that path - to the end. And at the end one found pleasure; which immediately resulted in the discovery that pleasure (whether that pleasure or any other) was not what you had been looking for. No moral question was involved; I was at this time as nearly nonmoral on that subject as a human creature can be. The frustration did not consist in finding a \\"lower\\" pleasure instead of a \\"higher.\\" It was the irrelevance of the conclusion that marred it. ... You might as well offer a mutton chop to a man who is dying of thirst as offer sexual pleasure to the desire I am speaking of. ... Joy is not a substitute for sex; sex is very often a substitute for Joy. I sometimes wonder whether all pleasures are not substitutes for Joy.","More like the real thing,\' said the lord Digory softly.","When you painted on earth \u2013 at least in your earlier days \u2013 it was because you caught glimpses of heaven in the earthly landscape. The success of your painting was that it enabled others to see the glimpses too.","That is one of the functions of art: to present what the narrow and desperately practical perspectives of real life exclude.","Be sure it is not for nothing that the Landlord has knit our hearts so closely to time and place \u2013 to one friend rather than another and one shire more than all the land.","Here and here only in all time the myth must have become fact; the Word, flesh; God, Man. This is not \'a religion\', nor \'a philosophy.\' It is the summing up and actuality of them all.","Time itself is one more name for death.","Human history is the long terrible story of man trying to find something other than God which will make him happy.","If we cannot persuade our friends by reasons we must be content \\"and not bring a mercenary army to our aid\\" (He meant passions.)","But I know this is impossible. I know that the thing I want is exactly the thing I can never get. The old life, the jokes, the drinks, the arguments, the lovemaking, the tiny, heartbreaking commonplace.","The bright side of it is, said Puddleglum, \u201cthat if we break our necks getting down the cliff, then we\u2019re safe from being drowned in the river.\u201d","People are often worried. They are told they ought to love God. They cannot find any such feeling in themselves. What are they to do? The answer is the same as before. Act as if you did. Do not sit trying to manufacture feelings. Ask yourself, \u2018If I were sure that I loved God, what would I do?\u2019 When you have found the answer, go and do it.","No time for better words, no time to unsay anything.-Til We Have Faces","We have trained them to think of the Future as a promised land which favored heroes attain-not as something which everyone reaches at the rate of sixty minutes an hour, whatever he does, whoever he is.","This wasn\'t a garden,\' said Susan presently. \'It was a castle...","Something inside us, the feeling of resentment, the feeling that wants to get one\'s own back, must be simply killed. I do not mean that anyone can decide this moment that he will never feel it anymore. That is not how things happen. I mean that every time it bobs its head up, day after day, year after year, all our lives long, we must hit it on the head. It is hard work, but the attempt is not impossible.","It is very true, said Edmund. But even a traitor may mend. I have known one that did.","We don\'t use the words begetting or begotten much in modern English, but everyone still knows what they mean. To beget is to become the father of: to create is to make. And the difference is this. When you beget, you beget something o the same kind as yourself. A man begets human babies, a beaver begets little beavers and a bird begets eggs which turn into little birds. But when you make, you make something of a different kind from yourself. A bird makes a nest, a beaver builds a dam, a man makes a wireless set \u2013 or he may make something more like himself than a wireless set: say, a statue. If he is clever enough carver he may make a statue which is very like man indeed. But, of course, it is not a ream man; it only looks like one. It cannot breathe or think. It is not alive.Now that is the first thing to get clear. What God begets is God; just as what man begets is man. What God creates is not God; just as what man makes is not man. That is why men are not Son\'s of God in the sense that Christ is. They may be like God in certain ways, but they are not things of the same kind. They are more like statues or pictures of God.","There are two kinds of people: those who say to God, \'Thy will be done,\' and those to whom God says, \'All right, then, have it your way.","But suppose that what you are up against is a surgeon whose intentions are wholly good. The kinder and more conscientious he is, the more inexorably he will go on cutting. If he yielded to your entreaties, if he stopped before the operation was complete, all the pain up to that point would have been useless.","A man who has been in another world does not come back unchanged.","Thomas Aquinas said of suffering, as Aristotle had said of shame, that it was a thing not good in itself; but a thing which might have a certain goodness in particular circumstances. That is to say, if evil is present, pain at recognition of the evil, being a kind of knowledge, is relatively good.","Every faculty you have, your power of thinking or of moving your limbs from moment to moment, is given you by God. If you devoted every moment of your whole life exclusively to His service you could not give Him anything that was not in a sense his own already ... It is like a small child going to its father and saying, \'Daddy, give me sixpence to buy you a birthday present.\' It is all very nice and proper, but only an idiot would think that the father is sixpence to the good on the transaction.","I object to that remark very strongly!- The Magician\'s Nephew","Milton was right,\u2019 said my Teacher. \u2018The choice of every lost soul can be expressed in the words \u201cBetter to reign in Hell than serve in Heaven. There is always something they insist on keeping even at the price of misery. There is always something they prefer to joy\u2014that is, to reality.\u201d","Never, in peace or war, commit your virtue or your happiness to the future.","Do not let your happiness depend on something you may lose. If love is to be a blessing, not a misery, it must be for the only Beloved who will never pass away.","There is something which unites magic and applied science (technology) while separating them from the \\"wisdom\\" of earlier ages. For the wise men of old, the cardinal problem of human life was how to conform the soul to objective reality, and the solution was wisdom, self-discipline, and virtue. For the modern, the cardinal problem is how to conform reality to the wishes of man, and the solution is a technique.","You cannot go on \'seeing through\' things for ever. The whole point of seeing through something is to see something through it. It is good that the window should be transparent, because the street or garden beyond it is opaque. How if you saw through the garden too? It is no use trying to \'see through\' first principles. If you see through everything, then everything is transparent. But a wholly transparent world is an invisible world. To \'see through\' all things is the same as not to see.","Do you think I am trying to weave a spell? Perhaps I am; but remember your fairy tales. Spells are used for breaking enchantments as well as for inducing them. And you and I have need of the strongest spell that can be found to wake us from the evil enchantment of worldliness which has been laid upon us for nearly a hundred years. Almost our whole education has been directed to silencing this shy, persistent, inner voice; almost all our modem philosophies have been devised to convince us that the good of man is to be found on this earth.","Many things--such as loving, going to sleep, or behaving unaffectedly--are done worst when we try hardest to do them.","There is no need to be worried by facetious people who try to make the Christian hope of \u2018Heaven\u2019 ridiculous by saying they do not want \u2018to spend eternity playing harps\u2019. The answer to such people is that if they cannot understand books written for grown-ups, they should not talk about them. All the scriptural imagery (harps, crowns, gold, etc.) is, of course, a merely symbolical attempt to express the inexpressible. Musical instruments are mentioned because for many people (not all) music is the thing known in the present life which most strongly suggests ecstasy and infinity. Crowns are mentioned to suggest the fact that those who are united with God in eternity share His splendour and power and joy. Gold is mentioned to suggest the timelessness of Heaven (gold does not rust) and the preciousness of it. People who take these symbols literally might as well think that when Christ told us to be like doves, He meant that we were to lay eggs.","And certainly both Horses were doing, if not all they could, all they thought they could; which is not quite the same thing.","The man is a humbug \u2014 a vulgar, shallow, self-satisfied mind, absolutely inaccessible to the complexities and delicacies of the real world. He has the journalist\'s air of being a specialist in everything, of taking in all points of view and being always on the side of the angels: Walter Helwich merely annoys a reader who has the least experience of knowing things, of what knowing is like. There is not two pence worth of real thought or real nobility in him. But he isn\'t dull\u2026","Plato rightly taught that virtue is one. You cannot be kind unless you have all the other virtues. If, being cowardly, conceited, and slothful, you have never yet done a fellow creature great mischief, that is only because your neighbour\'s welfare has not yet happened to conflict with your safety, self-approval, or ease. Every vice leads to cruelty.","For me the real evil of masturbation would be that it takes an appetite which, in lawful use, leads the individual out of himself to complete (and correct) his own personality in that of another (and finally in children and even grandchildren) and turns it back: sends the man back into the prison of himself, there to keep a harem of imaginary brides. And this harem, once admitted, works against his ever getting out and really uniting with a real woman. For the harem is always accessible, always subservient, calls for no sacrifices or adjustments, and can be endowed with erotic and psychological attractions which no real woman can rival. Among those shadowy brides he is always adored, always the perfect lover: no demand is made on his unselfishness, no mortification ever imposed on his vanity. In the end, they become merely the medium through which he increasingly adores himself . . . . And it is not only the faculty of love which is thus sterilized, forced back on itself, but also the faculty of imagination.The true exercise of imagination, in my view, is (a) To help us to understand other people (b) To respond to, and, some of us, to produce, art. But it has also a bad use: to provide for us, in shadowy form, a substitute for virtues, successes, distinctions etc. which ought to be sought outside in the real world\u2014e.g. picturing all I\u2019d do if I were rich instead of earning and saving. Masturbation involves this abuse of imagination in erotic matters (which I think bad in itself) and thereby encourages a similar abuse of it in all spheres. After all, almost the main work of life is to come out of our selves, out of the little, dark prison we are all born in. Masturbation is to be avoided as all things are to be avoided which retard this process. The danger is that of coming to love the prison.","The process which, if not checked, will abolish Man goes on apace among Communists and Democrats no less than among Fascists. The methods may (at first) differ in brutality. But many a mild-eyed scientist in pince-nez, many a popular dramatist, many an amateur philosopher in our midst, means in the long run just the same as the Nazi rulers of Germany: \'Traditional values are to be debunked\' and mankind to be cut out into some fresh shape at the will (which must, by hypothesis, be an arbitrary will) of some few lucky people in one lucky generation which has learned how to do it.","The enemy has filled His world full of pleasures . . . Everything has to be twisted before it is any use to us. We fight under cruel disadvantages. Nothing is naturally on our side. (Not that that excuses you...)","Discussions usually separate us; actions sometimes unite us.","The Moral Law isn\'t any one instinct or any set of instincts: it is something which makes a kind of tune (the tune we call goodness or right conduct) by directing the instincts. (...) The most dangerous thing you can do is to take any one impulse of your own nature and set it up as the thing you ought to follow at all costs. There\'s not one of them which won\'t make us into devils if we set it up as an absolute guide. You might think love of humanity in general was safe, but it isn\'t. If you leave out justice you\'ll find yourself breaking agreements and faking evidence in trials \'for the sake of humanity,\' and become in the end a cruel and treacherous man.","A great human philosopher nearly let our secret out when he said that where virtue is concerned, \\"Experience is the mother of illusion.","When we see the face of God we shall know that we have always known it. He has been a party to, has made, sustained and moved moment by moment within, all our earthly experiences of innocent love. All that was true love in them was, even on earth, far more His than ours, and ours only because His.","He was very interested in everything that lay to the North because no one ever went that way and he was never allowed to go there himself. When he was sitting out of doors mending the nets, and all alone, he would often look eagerly to the North. One could see nothing but a grassy slope running up to a level ridge and beyond that the sky with perhaps a few birds in it.Sometimes if Arsheesh was there Shasta would say, \'O my Father, what is there beyond that hill?\' And then if the fisherman was in a bad temper he would box Shasta\'s ears and tell him to attend to his work. Or if he was in a peaceable mood he would say, \\"O my son, do not allow your mind to be distracted by idle questions. For one of the poets has said, \'Application to business is the root of prosperity, but those who ask questions that do not concern them are steering the ship of folly towards the rock of indigence\'.Shasta thought that beyond the hill there must be some delightful secret which his father wished to hide from him. In reality, however, the fisherman talked like this because he didn\'t know what lay to the North. Neither did he care. He had a very practical mind.","The basic principle of the new education is to be that dunces and idlers must not be made to feel inferior to intelligent and industrious pupils. That would be \u2018undemocratic\u2019. These differences between the pupils\u2014for they are obviously and nakedly individual differences\u2014must be disguised. This can be done on various levels. At universities, examinations must be framed so that nearly all the students get good marks. Entrance examinations must be framed so that all, or nearly all, citizens can go to universities, whether they have any power (or wish) to profit by higher education or not. At schools, the children who are too stupid or lazy to learn languages and mathematics and elementary science can be set to doing the things that children used to do in their spare time. Let them, for example, make mud-pies and call it modelling. But all the time there must be no faintest hint that they are inferior to the children who are at work. Whatever nonsense they are engaged in must have\u2014I believe the English already use the phrase\u2014\u2018parity of esteem\u2019. An even more drastic scheme is not impossible. Children who are fit to proceed to a higher class may be artificially kept back, because the others would get a trauma\u2014Beelzebub, what a useful word!\u2014by being left behind. The bright pupil thus remains democratically fettered to his own age-group throughout his school career, and a boy who would be capable of tackling Aeschylus or Dante sits listening to his coaeval\u2019s attempts to spell out A CAT SAT ON THE MAT.","In other words, The\xadol\xadogy is prac\xadti\xadcal: espe\xadcially now.

If you must weep, weep: a good honest howl! I suspect we - and especially, my sex - don\'t cry enough now-a-days.

If justice is a superstition, then so is my duty to my country or my race. If the pursuit of scientific knowledge is a real value, then so is conjugal fidelity.

Many people seem to think it does. They think that if you ask them to forgive someone who has cheated or bullied them you are trying to make out that there was really no cheating or bullying. But if that were so, there would be nothing to forgive. (This doesn\'t mean that you must necessarily believe his next promise. It does mean that you must make every effort to kill every taste of resentment in your own heart - every wish to humiliate or hurt him or to pay him out.)","The quest of the Inner Ring will break your hearts unless you break it. But if you break it, a surprising result will follow. If in your working hours you make the work your end, you will presently find yourself all unawares inside the only circle in your profession that really matters. You will be one of the sound craftsmen, and other sound craftsmen will know it. This group of craftsmen will by no means coincide with the Inner Ring or the Important People or the People in the Know. It will not shape that professional policy or work up that professional influence which fights for the profession as a whole against the public: nor will it lead to those periodic scandals and crises which the Inner Ring produces. But it will do those things which that profession exists to do and will in the long run be responsible for all the respect which that profession in fact enjoys and which the speeches and advertisements cannot maintain. And if in your spare time you consort simply with the people you like, you will again find that you have come unawares to a real inside: that you are indeed snug and safe at the center of something which, seen from without, would look exactly like an Inner Ring. But the difference is that its secrecy is accidental, and its exclusiveness a by-product, and no one was led thither by the lure of the esoteric: for it is only four or five people who like one another meeting to do things that they like. This is friendship. Aristotle placed it among the virtues. It causes perhaps half of all the happiness in the world, and no Inner Ring can ever have it.","Narnia, Narnia, Narnia, awake. Love. Think. Speak. Be walking trees. Be talking beasts. Be divine waters.","But the most obvious fact about praise -- whether of God or anything -- strangely escaped me. I thought of it in terms of compliment, approval, or the giving of honor. I had never noticed that all enjoyment spontaneously overflows into praise. ... The world rings with praise -- lovers praising their mistresses, readers their favorite poet, walkers praising the countryside, players praising their favorite game. ... I think we delight to praise what we enjoy because the praise not merely expresses but completes the enjoyment; it is its appointed consummation.","Then it was you who wounded Aravis?\\" \\"It was I.\\" \\"But what for?\\" \\"Child,\\" said the Voice, \\"I am telling you your story, not hers. I tell no one any story but his own.","Where can you taste the joy of obeying unless He bids you do something for which His bidding is the only reason?","They have pulled down deep heaven on their heads.","Please, Aslan,\\" said Lucy, \\"what do you call soon?\\"\\"I call all times soon\\", said Aslan.","If all the world were Christian, it might not matter if all the world were educated. But a cultural life will exist outside the Church whether it exists inside or not. Good philosophy must exist, if for no other reason, because bad philosophy needs to be answered.","A great deal of democratic enthusiasm descends from the ideas of people like Rousseau, who believed in democracy because they thought mankind so wise and good that everyone deserved a share in the government. The danger of defending democracy on those grounds is that they\u2019re not true. . . I find that they\u2019re not true without looking further than myself. I don\u2019t deserve a share in governing a hen-roost, much less a nation. The real reason for democracy is: Mankind is so fallen that no man can be trusted with unchecked power over his fellows. Aristotle said that some people were only fit to be slaves. I do not contradict him. But I reject slavery because I see no men fit to be masters.","When all that says \'it is good\' has been debunked, what says \'I want\' remains. (...) The Conditioners, therefore, must come to be motivated simply by their own pleasure. (...) My point is that those who stand outside all judgements of value cannot have any ground for preferring one of their own impulses to another except the emotional strength of that impulse. (...) I am very doubtful myself whether the benevolent impulses, stripped of that preference and encouragement which the Tao teaches us to give them and left to their merely natural strength and frequency as psychological events, will have much influence. I am very doubtful whether history shows us one example of a man who, having stepped outside traditional morality and attained power, has used that power benevolently.","The Fellowship of the Ring is like lightning from a clear sky. . . To say that in it heroic romance, gorgeous, eloquent, and unashamed, has suddenly returned at a period almost pathological in its anti-romanticism, is inadequate. . . Here are beauties which pierce like swords or burn like cold iron; here is a book that will break your heart. . . .It is sane and vigilant invention, revealing at point after point the integration of the author\u2019s mind. . . Anguish is, for me, almost the prevailing note. But not, as in the literature most typical of our age, the anguish of abnormal or contorted souls; rather that anguish of those who were happy before a certain darkness came up and will be happy if they live to see it gone. . . . But with the anguish comes also a strange exaltation. . . when we have finished, we return to our own life not relaxed but fortified\u2026.Even now I have left out almost everything \u2014 the silvan leafiness, the passions, the high virtues, the remote horizons. Even if I had space I could hardly convey them. And after all the most obvious appeal of the book is perhaps also its deepest: \u201cthere was sorrow then too, and gathering dark, but great valour, and great deeds that were not wholly vain. Not wholly vain \u2014 it is the cool middle point between illusion and disillusionment.\u201d","Be thou glad sleeper and thy sorrow offcast. I am the gate to all good adventure.","But that would be putting the clock back,\\" gasped the Governor. \\"Have you no idea of progress, of development?\\"\\"I have seen them both in an egg,\\" said Caspian. \\"We call it Going bad in Narnia.","It means, said Aslan, \u201cthat though the Witch knew the Deep Magic, there is a magic deeper still which she did not know. Her knowledge goes back only to the dawn of time. But if she could have looked a little further back, into the stillness and the darkness before Time dawned, she would have read there a different incantation. She would have known that when a willing victim who had committed no treachery was killed in a traitor\u2019s stead, the Table would crack and Death itself would start working backward. And now\u2014\u201d","I believe it all. If I seem not to, it is only that my joy is too great to let my belief settle itself.","The hall is a place to wait in, a place from which to try the various doors, not a place to live in. For that purpose the worst of the rooms (whichever that may be) is, I think, preferable. It is true that some people may find they have to wait in the hall for a considerable time, while others feel certain almost at once which door they must knock at. I do not know why there is this difference, but I am sure God keeps no one waiting unless He sees that it is good for him to wait. When you do get into your room you will find that the long wait has done you some kind of good which you would not have had otherwise. But you must regard it as waiting, not as camping. You must keep on praying for light; and, of course, even in the hall, you must begin trying to obey the rules which are common to the whole house. And above all you must be asking which door is the true one; not which pleases you best by its paint and panelling. In plain language, the question should never be: \'Do I like that kind of service?\' but \'Are these doctrines true: is holiness here? Does my conscience move me towards this? Is my reluctance to knock at this door due to my pride, or my mere taste, or my personal dislike of this particular door-keeper?\'When you have reached your own room, be kind to those who have chosen different doors and to those who are still in the hall. If they are wrong they need your prayers all the more; and if there are your enemies, then you are under orders to pray for them. That is one of the rules common to the whole house.","We thought the Duke would have been pleased if the King\'s Majesty would have married his daughter, but nothing came of that--\'Squints, and has freckles,\' said Caspian.Oh, poor girl,\' said Lucy.","The problem of reconciling human suffering with the existence of God who loves, is only insoluble so long as we attach a trivial meaning to the word \'love\' and look on things as if man were the centre of them.","Weston did not know the Malacandrian word for laugh: indeed, it was not a word he understood very well in any language.","If we promoted justice and charity among men, we should be playing directly into the Enemy\'s hands; but if we guide them to the opposite behaviour, this sooner or later produces (for He permits it to produce) a war or a revolution, and the undisguisable issue of cowardice or courage awakes thousands of men from moral stupor. This, indeed, is probably one of the Enemy\'s motives for creating a dangerous world\u2014a world in which moral issues really come to the point. He sees as well as you do that courage is not simply one of the virtues, but the form of every virtue at the testing point, which means, at the point of highest reality. A chastity or honesty, or mercy, which yields to danger will be chaste or honest or merciful only on conditions.","The greed to be loved is a fearful thing. Some of those who say that they live only for love come to live in incessant resentment.","That\u2019s all right, said Edmund. \u201cBetween ourselves, you haven\u2019t been as bad as I was on my first trip to Narnia. You were only an ass, but I was a traitor.\u201d","Lord, are these your real terms? Can I meet H. again only if I learn to love you some much that I don\'t care whether I meet her or not? Consider, Lord, how it looks to us. What would anyone think of me if I said to the boys, \'No toffee now. But when you\'ve grown up and don\'t really want toffee you shall have as much of it as you choose\'?If I knew that to be eternally divided from H. and eternally forgotten by her would add a greater joy and splendour to her being, of course I\'d say \'Fire ahead.\' Just as if, on earth, I could have cured her cancer by never seeing her again, I\'d have arranged never to see her again. I\'d have had to. Any decent person would. But that\'s quite different. That\'s not the situation I\'m in.When I lay these questions before God I get no answer. But a rather special sort of \'No answer.\' It is not the locked door. It is more like a silent, certainly not uncompassionate, gaze. As though He shook His head not in refusal but waiving the question. Like, \'Peace, child; you don\'t understand.\'Can a mortal ask questions which God finds unanswerable? Quite easily, I should think.","You can never get a cup of tea large enough or a book long enough to suit me.\\" -C.S. Lewis","The sight of the huge world put mad ideas into me, as if I could wander away, wander forever, see strange and beautiful things, one after the other to the world\'s end.","I discovered that the wisdom of the world, and a great deal of its folly also, is to be found in the pages of books. And","No tea cup is big enough nor book long enough for me to be satisfied.","If the solar system was brought about by an accidental collision, then the appearance of organic life on this planet was also an accident, and the whole evolution of Man was an accident too. If so, then all our present thoughts are mere accidents--theaccidental by-product of the movement of atoms. And this holds for the thoughts of the materialists and astronomers as well as for anyone else\'s. But if their thoughts--i.e. of materialism and astronomy--are merely accidental by-products, why should we believe them to be true? I see no reason for believing that one accident should be able to give me a correct account of all the other accidents. It\'s like expecting that the accidental shape taken by the splash when you upset a milkjug should give you a correct account of how the jug was made and why it was upset.","By remembering it too often I have blurred the memory itself.","Have you ever noticed, said Dimble, \u201cthat the universe, and every bit of the universe is always hardening and narrowing and coming to a point?\u201dHis wife waited as those wait who know by long experience the mental processes of the person who is talking to them.\u201cI mean this,\u201d said Dimble in answer to the question she had not asked. \u201cIf you dip into any college, or school, or parish, or family \u2013 anything you like \u2013 at a given point in its history, you always find that there was a time before that point when there was more elbow room and contrasts weren\u2019t quite so sharp; and that there\u2019s going to be a time after that point when there is even less room for indecision and choices are even more momentous. Good is always getting better and bad is always getting worse: the possibilities of even apparent neutrality are always diminishing. The whole thing is sorting itself out all the time, coming to a point, getting sharper and harder.\u201d","We call a cancer bad, they would say, because it kills a man; but you might just as well call a successful surgeon bad because he kills a cancer.","You are never too old to set a new goal or to dream a new dream.","Supposing you hear a cry for help from a man in danger. You will probably feel two desires - one a desire to give help (due to your herd instinct), the other a desire to keep out of danger (due to the instinct for self-preservation). But you will find inside you, in addition to these two impulses, a third thing which tells you that you ought to follow the impulse to help, and suppress the impulse to run away. Now this thing that judges between two instincts, that decides which should be encouraged, cannot itself be either of them. You might as well say that the sheet of music which tells you, at a given moment, to play one note on the piano and not another, is itself one of the notes on the keyboard. The Moral Law tells us the tune we have to play: our instincts are merely the keys.","Oh, Aslan,\' said Lucy. \'Will you tell us how to get into your country from our world?\'\'I shall be telling you all the time,\' said Aslan. \'But I will not tell you how long or short the way will be; only that it lies across a river. But do not fear that, for I am the great Bridge Builder.","Yes, said the Lord Digory. \u201cIts inside is bigger than its outside.\u201d","No man who cares about originality will ever be original. It\'s the man who\'s only thinking about doing a good job or telling the truth who becomes really original -- and doesn\'t notice it.","You see, friends, he said, that before the new, clean world I gave you is seven hours old, a force of evil has already entered it; waked and brought hither by this son of Adam.","Shasta was dreadfully frightened. But it suddenly came into his head, \\"If you funk this, you\'ll funk every battle all your life. Now or never.","And the signs which you have learned here will not look at all as you expect them to look, when you meet them there. That is why it is so important to know them by heart and pay no attention to appearances. Remember the signs and believe the signs. Nothing else matters.","A man can\u2019t be always defending the truth; there must be a time to feed on it.","Don\u2019t you think the things people are most ashamed of are the things they can\u2019t help?","Her absence is like the sky spread over everything.","We want you to write it down--to camouflage it. Only for the present, of course. Once the thing gets going we shan\'t have to bother about the great heart of the British public. We\'ll make the great heart what we want it to be. But in the meantime, it does make a difference how things are put. For instance, if it were even whispered that the N.I.C.E. wanted powers to experiment on criminals, you\'d have all the old women of both sexes up in arms and yapping about humanity. Call it re-education of the mal-adjusted, and you have them all slobbering with delight that the brutal era of retributive punishment has at last come to and end. Odd thing it is--the word \'experiment\' is unpopular, but not the word \'experimental.\' You must\'nt experiment on children; but offer the dear little kiddies free education in an experimental school attached to the N.I.C.E. and it\'s all correct!","The symbol of a drama, a symphony, or a dance is useful to correct a certain absurdity which may arise if we talk too much of God planning and creating the world for good and then being frustrated by the free will of the creatures. This may raise the ridiculous idea that the Fall to God by surprise and upset His plan, or else \u2013 more ridiculous still \u2013 that God planned the whole thing for conditions which, He well knew, were never going to be realized. In fact, of course, God saw the crucifixion in the act of creating the first nebulae. The world is a dance in which good, descending from God, is disturbed by evil arising from the creatures, and the resulting conflict is resolved by God\'s own assumption of the suffering nature which evil produces.","Course he isn\'t safe. But he\'s good. He\'s the King, I tell you.","They were walking beside the stream and the Lion went before them: and he became so beautiful, and the music so despairing, that Jill did not know which of them it was that filled her eyes with tears.Then Aslan stopped, and the children looked into the stream. And there, on the golden gravel of the bed of the stream, lay King Caspian, dead, with the water flowing over him like liquid glass. His long white beard swayed in it like water-weed. And all three stood and wept. Even the Lion wept: great lion-tears, each tear more precious than the Earth would be if it was a single solid diamond.","The only people who achieve much are those who want knowledge so badly that they seek it while the conditions are still unfavourable. Favourable conditions never come.","One gets glimpses, even in our country, of that which is ageless--heavy thought in the face of an infant, and frolic childhood in that of a very old man.","No interviews without appointments except between nine and ten PM on the second Saturdays.","Do I hope that if feeling disguises itself as thought I shall feel less?","It is no use to ask God with factitious earnestness for A when our whole mind is in reality filled with the desire for B. We must lay before Him what is in us, not what ought to be in us.","In our own case we accept excuses too easily; in other people\u2019s we do not accept them easily enough.","I hid all the things I was feeling-- and indeed I did not know what they were, except that all the peace of that autumnal journey was gone","Now, if we are made for heaven, the desire for our proper place will be already in us, but not yet attached to the true object, and will even appear as the rival of that object [\u2026] If a transtemporal, transfinite good is our real destiny, then any other good on which our desire fixes must be in some degree fallacious, must bear at best only a symbolical relation to what will truly satisfy.","Make no mistake,\' He says, \'if you let me, I will make you perfect. The moment you put yourself in My hands, that is what you are in for. Nothing less, or other, than that. You have free will, and if you choose, you can push Me away. But if you do not push Me away, understand that I am going to see this job through. Whatever suffering it may cost you in your earthly life, whatever inconceivable purification it may cost you after death, whatever it costs Me, I will never rest, nor let you rest, until you are literally perfect - until my Father can say without reservation that He is well pleased with you, as He said He was well pleased with me. This I can do and will do. But I will not do anything less.","The only place outside Heaven where you can be perfectly safe from all the dangers and perturbations of love is Hell.","The beasts would not think it hard if I told them to walk on their heads. It would become their delight to walk on their heads. I am His beast, and all His biddings are joys.","Be just and merciful and brave.","To this day the vision of the world which comes most naturally to me is one in which \u201cwe two or \u201cwe few\u201d (and in a sense \u201cwe happy few\u201d) stand together against something stronger and larger.\u201d","Even to see her walk across the room is a liberal education.","Pure, spiritual, intellectual love shot from their faces like barbed lightning. It was so unlike the love we experience that its expression could easily be mistaken for ferocity.","Don\'t be scared by the word authority. Believing things on authority only means believing them because you\'ve been told them by someone you think trustworthy. Ninety-nine per cent of the things you believe are believed on authority. I believe there is such a place as New York. I haven\'t seen it myself. I couldn\'t prove by abstract reasoning that there must be such a place. I believe it because reliable people have told me so. The ordinary man believes in the Solar System, atoms, evolution, and the circulation of the blood on authority -because the scientists say so. Every historical statement in the world is believed on authority. None of us has seen the Norman Conquest or the defeat of the Armada. None of us could prove them by pure logic as you prove a thing in mathematics. We believe them simply because people who did see them have left writings that tell us about them: in fact, on authority. A man who jibbed at authority in other things as some people do in religion would have to be content to know nothing all his life.","Friendship is born at that moment when one person says to another: \\"What! You too?","destines them to eternity. He therefore, I believe, wants them to attend chiefly to two things, to eternity itself, and to that point of time, which they call the Present. For the Present is the point at which time touches eternity. Of the present moment, and of it only, humans have an experience analogous to the experience which [God] has of reality as a whole; in it alone freedom and actuality are offered them. He would therefore have them continually concerned either with eternity or with the Present--either meditating on their eternal union with, or separation from, Himself, or else obeying the present voice of conscience, bearing the present cross, receiving the present grace, giving thanks for the present pleasure.","But amid all these rejoicings Aslan himself quietly slipped away. And when the Kings and Queens noticed that he wasn\u2019t there they said nothing about it. For Mr. Beaver had warned them, \u201cHe\u2019ll be coming and going, he had said. \u201cOne day you\u2019ll see him and another you won\u2019t. He doesn\u2019t like being tied down\u2014and of course he has other countries to attend to. It\u2019s quite all right. He\u2019ll often drop in. Only you mustn\u2019t press him. He\u2019s wild, you know. Not like a tame lion.\u201d","Maybe it will go away,\' said Lucy.\'It\'ll be worse if it does,\' said Edmund, \'because then we shan\'t know where it is. If there is a wasp in the room I like to be able to see it.","Do not waste time bothering whether you \'love\' your neighbour; act as if you did ... the Christian, trying to treat every one kindly, finds himself liking more and more people as he goes on-including people he could not even have imagined himself liking at the beginning.","The knight is a man of blood and iron, a man familiar with the sight of smashed faces and the ragged stumps of lopped-off limbs; he is also a demure, almost maidenlike, guest in a hall, a gentle, modest, unobtrusive man. He is not compromise or happy mean between ferocity and meekness; he is fierce to the nth and meek to the nth. The man who combines both characters \u2013 the knight \u2013 is not a work of nature but of art; of that art which has human beings, instead of canvas or marble, for its medium.","Periods\' are largely an invention of the historians. The poetsthemselves are not conscious of living in any period and refuse to conform to the scheme.","It is arrogance in us to call frankness, fairness, and chivalry \u2018masculine\u2019 when we see them in a woman; it is arrogance in them to describe a man\u2019s sensitiveness or tact or tenderness as \u2018feminine.","To love and admire anything outside yourself is to take one step away from utter spiritual ruin","It was from the Lion that the light came. No one ever saw anything more terrible or beautiful.","Part of every misery is, so to speak, the misery\u2019s shadow or reflection: the fact that you don\u2019t merely suffer but have to keep on thinking about the fact that you suffer. I not only live each endless day in grief, but live each day thinking about living each day in grief.","Perhaps my bad temper or my jealousy are gradually getting worse - so gradually that the increase in seventy years will not be very noticeable. But it might be absolute hell in a million years!","It is not settled happiness but momentary joy that glorifies the past.","I am not sure that the best way to make a boy love the English poets might not be forbid him to read them and then make sure that he had plenty of opportunities to disobey you.","Having said that the unliterary reader attends to the words too little to make anything like a full use of them, I must notice that there is another sort of reader who attends to them far too much and in the wrong way. I am thinking of what I call Stylemongers. On taking up a book, these people concentrate on what they call its \u2018style\u2019 or its \u2018English\u2019. They judge this neither by its sound nor by its power to communicate but by its conformity to certain arbitrary rules. Their reading is a perpetual witch hunt for Americanisms, Gallicisms, split infinitives, and sentences that end with a preposition. They do not inquire whether the Americanism or Gallicism in question increases or impoverishes the expressiveness of our language. It is nothing to them that the best English speakers and writers have been ending sentences with prepositions for over a thousand years. They are full of arbitrary dislikes for particular words. One is \u2018a word they\u2019ve always hated\u2019; another \u2018always makes them think of so-and-so\u2019. This is too common, and that too rare. Such people are of all men least qualified to have any opinion about a style at all; for the only two tests that are really relevant\u2014the degree in which it is (as Dryden would say) \u2018sounding and significant\u2019\u2014are the two they never apply. They judge the instrument by anything rather than its power to do the work it was made for; treat language as something that \u2018is\u2019 but does not \u2018mean\u2019; criticise the lens after looking at it instead of through it.","Mental pain is less dramatic than physical pain, but it is more common and also more hard to bear. The frequent attempt to conceal mental pain increases the burden: it is easier to say \'My tooth is aching\' than to say \'My heart is broken\'. Yet if the cause is accepted and faced, the conflict will strengthen and purify the character and in time the pain will usually pass. Sometimes, however, it persists and the effect is devastating; if the cause is not faced or not recognised, it produces the dreary state of the chronic neurotic. But some by heroism overcome even chronic mental pain. They often produce brilliant work and strengthen, harden, and sharpen their characters till they become like tempered steel.","Theocracy has been rightly abolished not because it is bad that learned priests should govern ignorant laymen, but because priests are wicked men like the rest of us.","Something quite unexpected has happened. It came this morning early. For various reasons, not in themselves at all mysterious, my heart was lighter than it had been for many weeks.","If God is wiser that we His judgement must differ from ours on many things, and not least on good and evil. What seems to us good may therefore not be good in His eyes, and what seems to us evil may not be evil.","Why have your followers all drawn their swords, may I ask?\\" said Aslan.\\"May it please Your High Majesty,\\" said the second Mouse, whose name was Peepiceek, \\"we are all waiting to cut off our own tails if our Chief must go without his. We will not bear the shame of wearing an honor which is denied to the High Mouse.\\"\\"Ah!\\" roared Aslan. \\"You have conquered me. You have great hearts. Not for the sake of your dignity, Reepicheep, but for the love that is between you and your people, and still more for the kindness your people showed me long ago when you ate away the cords that bound me on the Stone Table (and it was then, though you have long forgotten it, that you began to be Talking Mice), you shall have your tail again.","I now see that I spent most of my life in doing neither what I ought nor what I liked\\". The Christians describe the Enemy as one \\"without whom Nothing is strong\\". And Nothing is very strong: strong enough to steal away a man\'s best years not in sweet sins but in a dreary flickering of the mind over it knows not what and knows not why, in the gratification of curiosities so feeble that the man is only half aware of them ...","How little people know who think that holiness is dull. When one meets the real thing, it is irresistible","He [The Bent One] has left you this way because a bent hnau can do more evil than a broken one.","The human mind has no more power of inventing a new value than of imagining a new primary colour,or, indeed, of creating a new sun and a new sky for it to move in.","Courage, dearheart","Since it is so likely children will meet cruel enemies, let them at least have heard of brave knights and heroic courage.","And that is the very end of the adventure of the wardrobe. But if the Professor was right it was only the beginning of the adventures of Narnia.","Man is to be understood only in his relation to God.","We all have different languages; but we all really mean the same thing.","Never, in peace or war, commit your virtue or your happiness to the future. Happy work is best done by the man who takes his long-term plans somewhat lightly and works from moment to moment \u201cas to the Lord. It is only our daily bread that we are encouraged to ask for. The present is the only time in which any duty can be done or any grace received.\u201d","A devilish temper she had, but she was a dem fine woman, sir, a dem fine woman.","Most of us are not really approaching the subject [scriptures] in order to find out what Christianity says: we are approaching it [them] in the hope of finding support from Christianity for the views of our own party.","Nothing can seem extraordinary until you have discovered what is ordinary. Belief in miracles, far from depending on an ignorance of the laws of nature, is only possible in so far as those laws are known.","Once you were a child. Once you knew what inquiry was for. There was a time when you asked questions because you wanted answers, and were glad when you had found them. Become that child again: even now.","This is the courtesy of Deep Heaven: that when you mean well, He always takes you to have meant better than you knew. It will not be enough for always. He is very jealous. He will have you for no one but Himself in the end. But for tonight, it is enough.","But, first, remember, remember, remember the signs. Say them to yourself when you wake in the morning and when you lie down at night, and when you wake in the middle of the night. And whatever strange things may happen to you, let nothing turn your mind from following the signs.","There was no sudden, striking, and emotional transition. Like the warming of a room or the coming of daylight. When you first notice them they have already been going on for some time.","The ideas that the whole human race is, in a sense, one thing- one huge organism, like a tree-must not be confused with the idea that individual difference is not important or that real people, Tom and Nobby and Kate, are some how less important than collective things like classes, races and so forth. Indeed the two ideas are opposites. Things which are parts of a single organism may be very different form one another: things which are not, may be very alike. Six pennies are quite separate and very alike: my nose and my lungs are very different but they are only alive at all because they are parts of my body and share its common life. Christianity thinks of individuals not as mere members of a group or items in a list, but as organs in a body- different from one another and each contributing what no other could.","When all that says \u2018it is good\u2019 has been debunked, what says \u2018I want\u2019 remains.","Those who reject Christianity will not be moved by Christ\u2019s statement that poverty is blessed. But here a rather remarkable fact comes to my aid. Those who would most scornfully repudiate Christianity as a mere \u2018opiate of the people\u2019 have a contempt for the rich, that is, for all mankind except the poor. They regard the poor as the only people worth preserving from \u2018liquidation\u2019, and place in them the only hope for the human race. But this is not compatible with a belief that the effects of poverty on those who suffer it are wholly evil; it even implies that they are good. The Marxist thus finds himself in real agreement with the Christian in those two beliefs which Christianity paradoxically demands \u2013 that poverty is blessed and yet ought to be removed.","Have you no idea of progress, of development?\\"\\"I have seen them both in an egg,\\" said Caspian. \\"We call it \'Going Bad\' in Narnia","Caspian felt sure that he would hate the new Tutor, but when the new Tutor arrived about a week later he turned out to be the sort of person it is almost impossible not to like. He was the smallest, and also the fattest, man Caspian had ever seen. He had a long, silvery, pointed beard which came down to his waist, and his face, which was brown and covered with wrinkles, looked very wise, very ugly, and very kind. His voice was grave and his eyes were merry so that, until you got to now him really well, it was hard to know when he was joking and when he was serious. His name was Doctor Cornelius.","When we want to be something other than the thing God wants us to be, we must be want what, in fact, will not make us happy.","To enter heaven is to become more human than you ever succeeded in being on earth; to enter hell is to be banished from humanity. What is cast (or casts itself) into hell is not a man: it is \u201cremains. To be a complete man means to have the passions obedient to the will and the will offered to God: to have been a man \u2013 to be an ex-man or \u201cdamned ghost\u201d \u2013 would presumably mean to consist of a will utterly centered in its self and passions utterly uncontrolled by the will.\u201d","It is very rarely that a middle-aged man finds an author who gives him, what he knew so often in his teens and twenties, the sense of having opened a new door.","We call bad one who rejects the fruit he is given for the fruit he is expecting or the fruit he was given last time.","The only logical explanation is that I was made for another world.","What are we born for?\u2019 \u2018For infinite happiness,\u2019 said the Spirit. \u2018You can step out into it at any moment\u2026","The literary man re-reads, other men simply read.","Please Aslan, before we go, will you tell us when we can come back to Narnia again? Please. And oh, do, do, do, make it soon.\\"\\"Dearest,\\" said Aslan very gently, \\"you and your brother will never come back to Narnia.\\"\\"Oh, Aslan!!\\" said Edmund and Lucy both together in despairing voices.\\"You are too old, children,\\" said Aslan, \\"and you must begin to come close to your own world now.\\"\\"It isn\'t Narnia, you know,\\" sobbed Lucy. \\"It\'s you. We shan\'t meet you there. And how can we live, never meeting you?\\"\\"But you shall meet me, dear one,\\" said Aslan.\\"Are \u2014 are you there too, Sir?\\" said Edmund.\\"I am,\\" said Aslan. \\"But there I have another name. You must learn to know me by that name. This was the very reason why you were brought to Narnia, that by knowing me here for a little, you may know me better there.","The joy came from finding at last what hatred was made for.","The fine flower of unholiness can grow only in the close neighborhood of the Holy.","The great art of life is to moderate our passions. Objects of affection are like other belongings. We must love them enough to enrich our lives while we have them, not enough to impoverish our lives when they are gone.","Still, there\'s no denying that in some sense I \'feel better,\' and with that comes at once a short of shame, and a feeling that one is under a sort of obligation to cherish and foment and prolong one\'s unhappiness.","The Christian doctrine of suffering explains, I believe, a very curious fact about the world we live in. The settled happiness and security which we all desire, God withholds from us by the nature of the world: but joy, pleasure, and merriment He has scattered broadcast...The security we crave would teach us to rest our hearts in this world and oppose an obstacle to our return to God...Our Father refreshes us on the journey with some pleasant inns, but will not encourage us to mistake them for home.","And Dimble, who had been sitting with his face drawn, and rather white, between the white faces of the two women, and his eyes on the table, raised his head, and great syllables of words that sounded like castles came out of his mouth. Jane felt her hear leap and quiver at them. Everything else in the room seemed to have been intensely quiet; even the bird, and the bear, and the cat, were still, staring at the speaker. The voice did not sound like Dimble\'s own: it was as if the words spoke themselves through him from some strong place at a distance--or as if they were not words at all but present operations of God, the planets, and the Pendragon. For this was the language spoken before the Fall and beyond the Moon and the meanings were not given to the syllables by chance, or skill, or long tradition, but truly inherent in them as the shape of the great Sun is inherent in the little waterdrop. This was Language herself, as she first sprang at Maleldil\'s bidding out of the molten quicksilver of the first star called Mercury on Earth, but Viritrilbia in Deep Heaven.","You couldn\'t expect good times to last.","Unattainability. The most intense joy lies not in the having, but inthe desiring. The delight that never fades, the bliss that is eternal,is only yours when what you most desire is just out of your reach.","But even a traitor may mend. I have known one that did.","To be stories at all they must be a series of events: but it must be understood that this series - the plot, as we call it - is only really a net whereby to catch something else.","If the Divine call does not make us better, it will make us very much worse. Of all bad men religious bad men are the worst. Of all created beings the wickedest is one who originally stood in the immediate presence of God.","Do you not know how bashful friendship is? Friends - comrades - do not look at each other. Friendship would be ashamed...","They say Aslan is on the move- perhaps has already landed.\\"And now a very curious thing happened. None of the children knew who Aslan was any more than you do; but the moment the Beaver had spoken these words everyone felt quite different. Perhaps it has sometimes happened to you in a dream that someone says something which you don\'t understand but in the dream it feels as if it has some enormous meaning- either a terrifying one which turns the whole dream into a nightmare or else a lovely meaning too lovely to put into words, which makes the dream so beautiful that you remember it all your life and are always wishing you could get into that dream again. It was like that now. At the name of Aslan each one of the children felt something jump in its inside. Edmund felt a sensation of mysterious horror. Peter felt suddenly brave and adventurous. Susan felt as if some delicious smell or some delightful strain of music had just floated by her. And Lucy got the feeling you have when you wake up in the morning and realize that it is the beginning of the holidays or the beginning of summer.","Then Caspian caught up a battle-axe and rushed upon the Lord Drinian to kill him, and Drinian stood still as a stock for the death blow. But when the axe was raised, Caspian suddenly threw it away and cried out, \\"I have lost my queen and my son: shall I lose my friend also?\\" And he fell upon the Lord Drinian\'s neck and embraced him and both wept, as their friendship was not broken.","It is a profound mistake to imagine that Christianity ever intended to dissipate the bewilderment and even the terror, the sense of our own nothingness, which come upon us when we think about the nature of things. It comes to intensify them. Without such sensations there is no religion. Many a man, brought up in the glib profession of some shallow form of Christianity, who comes through reading Astronomy to realize for the first time how majestically indifferent most reality is to man, and who perhaps abandons his religion on that account, may at that moment be having his first genuinely religious experience. . . . Christianity does not involve the belief that all things were made for man.","It is well to have specifically holy places, and things, and days, for, without these focal points or reminders, the belief that all is holy and \\"big with God\\" will soon dwindle into a mere sentiment. But if these holy places, things, and days cease to remind us, if they obliterate our awareness that all ground is holy and every bush (could we but perceive it) a Burning Bush, then the hallows begin to do harm.","I saw well why the gods do not speak to us openly, nor let us answer. Till that word can be dug out of us, why should they hear the babble that we think we mean? How can they meet us face to face till we have faces?","And the Divine Nature can change the past. Nothing is yet in its true form.","If you find yourself with a desire that no experience in this world can satisfy, then the most probable explanation is that you were made for another world.","We teach them not to notice the different sense of the possessive pronoun .. . Even in the nursery a child can be taught to mean by \\"my Teddy-bear\\" not the old imagined recipient of affection to whom it stands in a special relation (for that is what the Enemy will teach them to mean if we are not careful) but \\"the bear I can pull to pieces if I like.","Feelings come and go, and when they come a good use can be made of them, but they cannot be our regular spiritual diet.","I doubt whether anyone who has tasted it would ever, if both were in his power, exchange it for all the pleasures in the world. But then Joy is never in our power and pleasure often is.","IF ONE COULD RUN WITHOUT GETTING tired, I don\u2019t think one would often want to do anything else.","Take care. It is so easy to break eggs without making omelettes.","We are king\'s daughters still,\\" I said.","I cannot love a lie,\\" said the Lady. \\"I cannot love the thing which is not. I am in Love, and out of it I will not go.","We all want progress, but if you\'re on the wrong road, progress means doing an about-turn and walking back to the right road; in that case the man who turns back soonest is the most progressive.","The number of things he thought of saying all at once nearly suffocated him.","the very last thing I want to do is to unsettle in the mind of any Christian, whatever his denomination, the concepts -- for him traditional -- by which he finds it profitable to represent to himself what is happening when he receives the bread and wine. I could wish that no definitions had ever been felt to be necessary; and, still more, that none had been allowed to make divisions between churches.","Anger is the fluid that love bleeds when it gets cut.","The fairy tale is accused of giving children a false impression of the world they live in. But I think no literature that children could read gives them less of a false impression. I think what profess to be realistic stories for children are far more likely to deceive them. I never expected the real world to be like the fairy tales. I think that I did expect school to be like the school stories. The fantasies did not deceive me: the school stories did. All stories in which children have adventures and successes which are possible, in the sense that they do not break the laws of nature, but almost infinitely improbable, are in more danger than the fairy tales of raising false expectations\u2026 This distinction holds for adult reading too. The dangerous fantasy is always superficially realistic. The real victim of wishful reverie does not batten on the Odyssey, The Tempest, or The Worm Ouroboros: he (or she) prefers stories about millionaires, irresistible beauties, posh hotels, palm beaches and bedroom scenes\u2014things that really might happen, that ought to happen, that would have happened if the reader had had a fair chance. For, as I say, there are two kinds of longing. The one is an askesis, a spiritual exercise, and the other is a disease.","Still, there\'s no denying that in some sense I \'feel better,\' and with that comes at once a sort of shame, and a feeling that one is under a sort of obligation to cherish and foment and prolong one\'s unhappiness....What is behind it? Partly, no doubt, vanity. We want to prove to ourselves that we are lovers on the grand scale, tragic heroes; not just ordinary privates in the huge army of the bereaved, slogging along and making the best of a bad job.","Amar \xe9, sempre, ser vulner\xe1vel.

Men like me, who possess hidden wisdom, are freed from common rules just as we are cut off from common pleasures. Ours, my boy, is a high and lonely destiny.","One man may be so placed that his anger sheds the blood of thousands, and another so placed that however angry he gets he will only be laughed at. But the little mark on the soul may be much the same in both. Each has done something to himself which, unless he repents, will make it harder for him to keep out of the rage next time he is tempted, and will make the rage worse when he does fall into it. Each of them, if he seriously turns to God, can have that twist in the central man straightened out again: each is, in the long run, doomed if he will not. The bigness or smallness of the thing, seen from the outside, is not what really matters.","We try, when we wake, to lay the new day at God\u2019s feet; before we have finished shaving, it becomes our day and God\u2019s share in it is felt as a tribute which we must pay out of \u2018our own\u2019 pocket, a deduction from the time which ought, we feel, to be \u2018our own\u2019. A man starts a new job with a sense of vocation and, perhaps, for the first week still keeps the discharge of the vocation as his end, taking the pleasures and pains from God\u2019s hand, as they came, as \u2018accidents\u2019. But in the second week he is beginning to \u2018know the ropes\u2019: by the third, he has quarried out of the total job his own plan for himself within that job, and when he can pursue this he feels that he is getting no more than his rights, and when he cannot, that he is being interfered.","I don\'t know that I care much about living on and on after everyone I know is dead. I\'d rather live an ordinary time and die and go to Heaven.","I\'m afraid it\'s not much use to you, Mr. Rumblebuffin.\'Not at all. Not at all.\' said the giant politely. \'Never met a nicer hankerchee.","Suppose we have only dreamed, or made up all those things - trees and grass and sun and moon and stars and Aslan himself. Suppose we have. Then all I can say is that, in that case, the made-up things seem a good deal more important than the real ones.","The truth is that wherever a man lies with a woman, there, whether they like it or not, a transcendental relation is set up between them which must be eternally enjoyed or eternally endured.","When we carry out our \\"religious duties\\" we are like people digging channels in a waterless land, in order that when at last water comes, it may find them ready.","Forget your pride (what have you to be proud of?) and forget your anger (who has done you wrong?) and accept the mercy of these good kings.","If tribulation is a necessary element in the redemption we must anticipate that it will never cease till God sees the world to be either redeemed or no further redeemable. A Christian cannot, therefore, believe any of those who promise that if only some reform in our economic, political, or hygienic system were made, a heaven on earth would follow. This might seem to have a discouraging effect on the social worker, but it is not found in practice to discourage him. On the contrary, a strong sense of our common miseries, simply as men, is at least as good a spur to the removal of all the miseries we can, as any of those wild hopes which tempt men to seek their realisation by breaking the moral law and prove such dust and ashes when they are realised. If applied to individual life, the doctrine that an imagined heaven on earth as necessary for vigorous attempts to remove present evil, would at once reveal its absurdity. Hungry men seek food and sick men healing none the less because they know that after the meal or the cure the ordinary ups and downs of life still await them.","Do not waste time bothering whether you \'love\' your neighbor; act as if you did.","I\'m ready to accept Jesus as a great moral teacher, but I don\'t accept His claim to be God.\' That is the one thing we must not say. A man who was merely a man and said the sort of things Jesus said would not be a great moral teacher ... You must make your choice. Either this man was, and is, the Son of God: or else a madman or something worse. You can shut Him up for a fool ... or you can fall at His feet and call Him Lord and God. But let us not come with any patronizing nonsense about His being a great human teacher. He has not left that open to us.","you must have a capacity to receive, or even omnipotence can\u2019t give.","Lead us, Evolution, lead usUp the future\'s endless stair;Chop us, change us, prod us, weed us.For stagnation is despair:Groping, guessing, yet progressing,Lead us nobody knows where.Wrong or justice, joy or sorrow,In the present what are theywhile there\'s always jam-tomorrow,While we tread the onward way?Never knowing where we\'re going,We can never go astray.To whatever variationOur posterity may turnHairy, squashy, or crustacean,Bulbous-eyed or square of stern,Tusked or toothless, mild or ruthless,Towards that unknown god we yearn.Ask not if it\'s god or devil,Brethren, lest your words implyStatic norms of good and evil(As in Plato) throned on high;Such scholastic, inelastic,Abstract yardsticks we deny.Far too long have sages vainlyGlossed great Nature\'s simple text;He who runs can read it plainly,\'Goodness = what comes next.\'By evolving, Life is solvingAll the questions we perplexed.Oh then!

Despair of objective truth had been increasingly insinuated into the scientists; indifference to it, and a concentration upon mere power, had been the result\u2026 The very experiences of the dissecting room and the pathological laboratory were breeding a conviction that the stifling of all deep-set repugnances was the first essential for progress.","To love, and to lose what we love, are equally things appointed for our nature. If we cannot bear the second well, that evil is ours.","1You said \u2018The world is going back to Paganism\u2019.Oh bright Vision!

No word in my vocabulary expressed deeper hatred than the word INTERFERENCE. But Christianity placed at the centre what then seemed to me a transcendental Interferer. If its picture were true then no sort of \'treaty with reality\' could ever be possible. There was no region even in the innermost depth of one\'s soul (nay, there least of all) which one could surround with a barbed wire fence and guard with a notice No Admittance. And that was what I wanted; some area, however small, of which I could say to all other beings, \'This is my business and mine only.","He\'ll be coming and going. One day you\'ll see him and another you won\'t.","If he now failed, this world also would hereafter be redeemed. If he were not the ransom, another would be. Yet nothing was ever repeated.

Girls never want to know anything but gossip and rot about people getting engaged.","Christianity agrees with Dualism that this universe is at war. But it does not think this is a war between independent powers.

They meant that sex was to be treated as no other impulse in our nature has ever been treated by civilized people. All the others, we admit, have to be bridled. Absolute obedience to your instinct for self-preservation is what we call cowardice; to your acquisitive impulse, avarice. Even sleep must be resisted if you\u2019re a sentry.

And all at once (they never knew exactly how it happened) the face seemed to be a sea of tossing gold in which they were floating, and such a sweetness and power rolled about them and over them and entered into them that they felt they had never really been happy or wise or good, or even alive and awake, before. And the memory of that moment stayed with them always, so that as long as they both lived, if ever they were sad or afraid or angry, the thought of all that golden goodness, and the feeling that it was still there, quite close, just round some corner or just behind some door, would come back and make them sure, deep down inside, that all was well.","Christianity is the story of how the rightful King has landed, you might say in disguise, and is calling us all to take part in His great campaign of sabotage.","In your world, I have another name.

Do I hope that if feeling disguises itself as thought I shall feel less? Aren\u2019t all these notes the senseless writhings of a man who won\u2019t accept the fact that there is nothing we can do with suffering except to suffer it? Who still thinks there is some device (if only he could \ufb01nd it) which will make pain not to be pain. It doesn\u2019t really matter whether you grip the arms of the dentist\u2019s chair or let your hands lie in your lap. The drill drills on. And grief still feels like fear. Perhaps, more strictly, like suspense. Or like waiting; just hanging about waiting for something to happen. It gives life a permanently provisional feeling.

WEll, I am afraid I sometimes do (and those are, no doubt, my worst moments)...","And in truth (as I now see) I had the wish to put off my journey as long as I could. Not for any peril or labour it might cost; but because I could see nothing in the whole world for me to do once it was accomplished.

You need not guess, for I will tell you; I am a great coward... If I knew any way of escape I would crawl through sewers to find it. But what is the good of telling you about my feelings? You know them already; they are the same as yours. I am not arguing that pain is not painful. Pain hurts. That is what the word means. I am only trying to show that the old Christian doctrine of being made \'perfect through suffering\' is not incredible.

I don\'t want him to live forever, and I know he won\'t live forever whether I want him to or not.","I remember once when I had been giving a talk to the R.A.F., an old, hard-bitten officer got up and said, \u2018I\u2019ve no use for all that stuff. But, mind you, I\u2019m a religious man too. I know there\u2019s a God. I\u2019ve felt Him: out alone in the desert at night: the tremendous mystery. And that\u2019s just why I don\u2019t believe all your neat little dogmas and formulas about Him. To anyone who\u2019s met the real thing they all seem so petty and pedantic and unreal!\u2019Now in a sense I quite agreed with that man. I think he had probably had a real experience of God in the desert. And when he turned from that experience to the Christian creeds, I think he really was turning from something real to something less real. In the same way, if a man has once looked at the Atlantic from the beach, and then goes and looks at a map of the Atlantic, he also will be turning from something real to something less real: turning from real waves to a bit of coloured paper. But here comes the point. The map is admittedly only coloured paper, but there are two things you have to remember about it. In the first place, it is based on what hundreds and thousands of people have found out by sailing the real Atlantic. In that way it has behind it masses of experience just as real as the one you could have from the beach; only, while yours would be a single glimpse, the map fits all those different experiences together. In the second place, if you want to go anywhere, the map is absolutely necessary. As long as you are content with walks on the beach, your own glimpses are far more fun than looking at a map. But the map is going to be more use than walks on the beach if you want to get to America.","But the trouble is that what we call \u201casking God\u2019s forgiveness very often really consists in asking God to accept our excuses.\u201d","If you are thirsty, come and drink.","It is not certain that some wicked one of your race will not find out a secret as evil as the Deplorable Word and use it to destroy all living things.

Let your world beware. That is the warning.","Son, said Aslan to the Cabby, \u201cI have known you long. Do you know me?\u201d","Creatures, I give you yourselves,\\" said the strong, happy voice of Aslan. \\"I give to you forever this land of Narnia. I give you the woods, the fruits, the rivers.

All virtues are less formidable to us once the man is aware that he has them, but this is specially true of humility. Catch him at the moment when he is really poor in spirit and smuggle into his mind the gratifying reflection, \'By jove! I\'m being humble!\', and almost immediately pride\u2014pride at his own humility\u2014will appear.

I was the cat who comforted you among the houses of the dead. I was the lion who drove the jackals from you while you slept.

And I was the lion you do not remember who pushed the boat in which you lay, a child near death, so that it came to shore where a man sat, wakeful at midnight, to receive you.","To decide what the best use of it is, you must ask what use the Enemy wants to make of it, and then do the opposite.","I do love that tune - but really, I must go home.

As long as you notice, and have to count, the steps, you are not yet dancing but only learning to dance.","Reality is harsh to the feet of shadows.","To the Ancients, Friendship seemed the happiest and most fully human of all loves; the crown of life and the school of virtue.

That might have been so if he had lived a few centuries earlier. At that time the humans still knew pretty well when a thing was proved and when it was not; and if it was proved they really believed it. They still connected thinking with doing and were prepared to alter their way of life as the result of a chain of reasoning. But what with the weekly press and other such weapons we have largely altered that. Your man has been accustomed, ever since he was a boy, to have a dozen incompatible philosophies dancing about together inside his head. He doesn\'t think of doctrines as primarily \'true\' or \'false\', but as \'academic\' or \'practical\', \'outworn\' or \'contemporary\', \'conventional\' or \'ruthless\'. Jargon, not argument, is your best ally in keeping him from the Church.","Exactly as he spoke, Polly\'s hand went out to touch one of the rings.

To love at all is to be vulnerable. Love anything, and your heart will certainly be wrung and possibly be broken. If you want to make sure of keeping it intact, you must give your heart to no one, not even to an animal. Wrap it carefully round with hobbies and little luxuries; avoid all entanglements; lock it up safe in the casket or coffin of your selfishness. But in that casket\u2014safe, dark, motionless, airless\u2014it will change. It will not be broken; it will become unbreakable, impenetrable, irredeemable. The alternative to tragedy, or at least to the risk of tragedy, is damnation.","Friendship (as the ancients saw) can be a school of virtue; but also (as they did not see) a school of vice. It is ambivalent. It makes good men better and bad men worse.","It\'s not a question of God `sending\' us to Hell. In each of us there is something growing up which will of itself be Hell unless it is nipped in the bud.","And of course it is different; as different as a real thing is from a shadow or as waking life is from a dream.","You can get a large audience together for a strip-tease act\u2014that is, to watch a girl undress on the stage.

Do not be deceived Wormwood. Our cause is never more in danger than when a human, no longer desiring, but still intending, to do our Enemy\'s will, looks round upon a universe from which every trace of Him seems to have vanished, and asks why he has been forsaken, and still obeys.","Each miracle writes for us in small letters something that God has already written, or will write, in letters almost too large to be noticed, across the whole canvas of Nature.","Perhaps in the soul, as in the soil, those growths that show the brightest colours and put forth the most overpowering smell have not always the deepest root.","I am not sure whether I can make you understand it. It was something more than a prudent desire to avoid creatures alien in kind, very powerful, and very intelligent. The truth was that all I heard about them served to connect two things which one\'s mind tends to keep separate, and that connecting gave one sort of a shock. We tend to think about non-human intelligences in two distinct categories which we label \\"scientific\\" and \\"supernatural\\" respectively. We think, in one mood, of Mr. Wells\' Martians (very unlike the real Malacandrians, by the bye), or his Selenites. In quite a different mood we let our minds loose on the possibility of angels, ghosts, fairies, and the like. But the very moment we are compelled to recognise a creature in either class as real, the distinction begins to get blurred: and when it is a creature like an eldil the distinction vanishes altogether. These things were not animals-to that extent one had to classify them with the second group; but they had some kind of material vehicle whose presence could (in principle) be scientifically verified. To that extent they belonged to the first group. The distinction between natural and supernatural, in fact, broke down; and when it had done so, one realised how great a comfort it had been-how it had eased the burden of intolerable strangeness which this universe imposes on us by dividing it into two halves and encouraging the mind never to think of both in the same context.","It is the magician\u2019s bargain: give up our soul, get power in return. But once our souls, that is, ourselves, have been given up, the power thus conferred will not belong to us.

I could show you a pretty cageful down here,","But supposing God became a man - suppose our human nature which can suffer and die was amalgamated with God\'s nature in one person - then that person could help us. He could surrender His will, and suffer and die, because He was man; and He could do it perfectly because He was God. You and I can go through this process only if God does it in us; but God can only do it if He becomes man. Our attempts at this dying will succeed only if we men share in God\'s dying, just as our thinking can succeed only because it is a drop out of the ocean of His intelligence: but we cannot share God\'s dying unless God dies; and He cannot die except by being a man. That is the sense in which He pays our debt, and suffers for us what He Himself need not suffer at all.","Out of the trees wild people stepped forth, gods Fauns and Satyrs and Dwarfs.

It had not made at all the same impression on him as on the Cabby and on the children. For what you see and hear depends a good deal on where you are standing. It also depends on what sort of person you are.","When you meet me here again, you will have come to stay. But not now.

In Perelandra it would have no meaning at all.","Evil can be undone, but it cannot \\"develop\\" into good.","Sometimes, Lord, one is tempted to say that if you wanted us to behave like the lilies of the field you might have given us an organization more like theirs.

We have done this by inculcating The Historical Point of View. The Historical Point of View, put briefly, means that when a learned man is presented with any statement in an ancient author, the one question he never asks is whether it is true. He asks who influenced the ancient writer, and how far the statement is consistent with what he said in other books, and what phase in the writer\'s development, or in the general history of thought, it illustrates, and how it affected later writers, and how often it has been misunderstood (specially by the learned man\'s own colleagues) and what the general course of criticism on it has been for the last ten years, and what is the \\"present state of the question\\". To regard the ancient writer as a possible source of knowledge - to anticipate that what he said could possibly modify your thoughts or your behaviour - this would be rejected as unutterably simple-minded. And since we cannot deceive the whole human race all the time, it is most important thus to cut every generation off from all others; for where learning makes a free commerce between the ages there is always the danger that the characteristic errors of one may be corrected by the characteristic truths of another.

Oh do, do, do.\'\'Indeed, yes, I will tell it to you for years and years.","I am sure that God keeps no one waiting unless He sees that it is good for him to wait.","Images of the Holy easily become holy images -- sacrosanct. My idea of God is not a divine idea. It has to be shattered time after time. He shatters it Himself. He is the great iconoclast. Could we not almost say that this shattering is one of the marks His presence? The Incarnation is the supreme example; it leads all previous idea of the Messiah in ruins.","There are dozens of ways to give people a bad time if you are in your own home and they are only visitors.","Jesus Christ was either a liar, a lunatic, or He was who He said He was","Suppose we have only dreamed, or made up, all of those things-trees and grass and sun and moon and stars and Aslan himself. Suppose we have. Then all I can say is that, in that case, the made-up things seem a good deal more important than the real ones... That\'s why I\'m going to stand by the play world. I\'m on Aslan\'s side even if there isn\'t any Aslan to lead it. I\'m going to live like a Narnian even if there isn\'t any Narnia.--Puddleglum, The Silver Chair, C. S. Lewis","If you look for truth, you may find comfort in the end: if you look for comfort you will not get either comfort or truth\u2014only soft soap and wishful thinking to begin with and, in the end, despair.","Courtship is the time for sowing those seeds which grow up ten years later into domestic hatred.","a man...can find comfort in words coming out of his own mouth.","It is not that we do not believe the Lord wants the best for us. It is that we wonder how painful the best will be.","The sensualist, I\'ll allow ye, begins by pursuing a real pleasure, though a small one. His sin is the less. but the time comes on when, though the pleasure becomes less and less and the craving fiercer and fiercer, and though he knows that joy can never come that way, yet he prefers to joy the mere fondling of unappeasable lust and would not have it taken from him. he\'d fight to the death to keep it. He\'d like well to be able to scratch: but even when he can scratch no more he\'d rather itch than not.","For any happiness, even in this world, quite a lot of restraint is going to be necessary...","Even of his sins the Enemy does not want him to think too much: once they are repented, the sooner the man turns his attention outward, the better the Enemy is pleased.","No se puede alcanzar la suprema sabiduria sin sacrificios.","Narnia, Narnia, Narnia, despierta. Ama. Piensa. Habla. Sed arboles que caminan. Sed bestias que hablan. Sed aguas divinas.","To know what would have happened, child?\\" said Aslan. \\"No. Nobody is ever told that.","So that the one road for which we now need God\'s leadership most of all is a road God, in His own nature, has never walked. But suppose God became a man... He could surrender His will, suffer and die, because He was a man...","Did Maleldil suggest that our own world might have been saved if the elephant had accidentally trodden on the serpent a moment before Eve was about to yield?","Isn\'t it funny how day by day nothing changes but when you look back everything is different.","Every moment the patches of green grew bigger and the patches of snow grew smaller. Every moment more and more of the trees shook off their robes of snow. Soon, wherever you looked, instead of white shapes you saw the dark green of firs or the black prickly branches of bare oaks and beeches and elms. Then the mist turned from white to gold and presently cleared away altogether. Shafts of delicious sunlight struck down on to the forest floor and overhead you could see a blue sky between the tree tops. Soon there were more wonderful things happening. Coming suddenly round a corner into a glade of silver birch trees Edmund saw the ground covered in all directions with little yellow flowers- celandines. The noise of water grew louder. Presently they actually crossed a stream. Beyond it they found snowdrops growing.","When one has read a book, I think there is nothing so nice as discussing it with some one else - even though it sometimes produces rather fierce arguments.","And all at once (they never knew exactly how it happened) the face seemed to be a sea of tossing gold in which they were floating, and such a sweetness and power rolled over them that they felt they had never really been happy or wise or good, or even alive and awake before. And the memory of that moment stayed with them always, so that as long as they both lived, if ever they were sad or afraid or angry, the thought of all that golden goodness, and the feeling that it was still there, quite close, just around the corner or just behind some door, would come back and make them sure, deep down inside, that all was well.","Oh, of course. I\u2019m wrong. Everything I say or do is wrong, according to you.\u2019 \u2018But of course!\u2019 said the Spirit, shining with love and mirth so that my eyes were dazzled. \u2018That\u2019s what we all find when we reach this country. We\u2019ve all been wrong! That\u2019s the great joke. There\u2019s no need to go on pretending one was right! After that we begin living.","To be a Christian means to forgive the inexcusable, because God has forgiven the inexcusable in you.","You have never talked to a mere mortal.","Puddleglum!\\" said Jill. \\"You\'re a regular old humbug. You sound as doleful as a funeral and I believe you\'re perfectly happy. And you talk as if you were afraid of everything, when you\'re really as brave as - as a lion.","The creatures are always accusing one another of wanting \u2018to eat the cake and have it\u2019; but thanks to our labours they are more often in the predicament of paying for the cake and not eating it.","The characteristic of Pains and Pleasures is that they are unmistakably real, and therefore, as far as they go, give the man who feels them a touchstone of reality.","We all want progress, but if you are on the wrong road, progress means doing an about-turn and walking back to the right road; in that case the man who turns back soonest is the most progressive.","Fellows of colleges do not always find money matters easy to understand: if they did, they would probably not have been the sort of men who become Fellows of colleges.","We had better share our bewilderments. By hiding them from each other we should not hide them from ourselves.","I felt sure that [Oyarsa] was what we call \\"good,\\" but I wasn\'t sure whether I liked \\"goodness\\" so much as I had supposed.","I wrote fairy tales because the Fairy Tale seemed the ideal Form for the stuff I had to say.Then of course the Man in me began to have his turn. I thought I saw how stories of this kind could steal past a certain inhibition which had paralyzed much of my own religion in childhood. Why did one find it so hard to feel as one was told one ought to feel about God or about the sufferings of Christ? I thought the chief reason was that one was told one ought to. As obligation to feel can freeze feelings. (from the essay Sometimes Fairy Stories May Say Best What\u2019s To Be Said)","noble death is a treasure which no one is too poor to buy.","My hope is that when I die, all of hell rejoices that I am out of the fight.","The two things that came out clearly were the sense of reality in the background and the mythical value: the essence of myth being that it should have no taint of allegory to the maker and yet should suggest incipient allegories to the reader.[C.S. Lewis writes to J.R.R. Tolkien on December 7, 1929]","That ride was perhaps the most wonderful thing that happened to them in Narnia. Have you ever had a gallop on a horse? Think of that; and then take away the heavy noise of the hoofs and the jingle of the bit and imagine instead the almost noiseless padding of the great paws. Then imagine instead of the black or grey or chestnut back of the horse the soft roughness of golden fur, and the mane flying back in the wind. And then imagine you are going about twice as fast as the fastest racehorse. But this is a mount that doesn\'t need to be guided and never grows tired. He rushes on and on, never missing his footing, never hesitating, threading his way with perfect skill between tree trunks, jumping over bush and briar and the smaller streams, wading the larger, swimming the largest of all. And you are riding not on a road nor in a park nor even on the downs, but right across Narnia, in spring, down solemn avenues of beech and across sunny glades of oak, through wild orchards of snow-white cherry trees, past roaring waterfalls and mossy rocks and echoing caverns, up windy slopes alight with gorse bushes, and across the shoulders of heathery mountains and along giddy ridges and down, down, down again into wild valleys and out into acres of blue flowers.","The tuning up of an orchestra can be itself delightful, but only to those who can in some measure, however little, anticipate the symphony.","You talk far too much...Procure for me at once a chariot or a flying carpet or a well-trained dragon, or whatever is usual for royal and noble persons in your land. Then bring me to places where I can get clothes and jewels and slaves fit for my rank. Tomorrow I will begin my conquest of the world.","He is indeed but breathing dust and a careless touch would unmake him. And in his best thoughts there are such things mingled as, if we thought them, our light would perish. But he is in the body of Maleldil and his sins are forgiven.","I had not noticed how the humblest, and at the same time most balanced and capacious, minds praised most, while the cranks, misfits, and malcontents praised least. The good critics found something to praise in many imperfect works; the bad ones continually narrowed the list of books we might be allowed to read. The healthy and unaffected man, even if luxuriously brought up and widely experienced in good cookery, could praise a very modest meal: the dyspeptic and the snob found fault with all. Except where intolerably adverse circumstances interfere, praise almost seems to be inner health made audible.","By mixing a little truth with it they had made their lie far stronger.","The duty of planning tomorrow\'s work is today\'s duty; though its material is borrowed from the future, the duty, like all duties, is in the Present.","If ants had a language they would, no doubt, call their anthill an artifact and describe the brick wall in its neighborhood as a natural object. Nature in fact would be for them all that was not \'ant-made\'.","It was likely, then that this\u2014-this stumbling walk on a wet night across a ploughed field-\u2014meant death. Death\u2014-the thing one had always heard of (like love), the thing the poets had written about. So this was how it was going to be. But that was not the main point.","If we really believe what we say we believe- if we really think that home is elsewhere and that this life is a \\"wandering to find home\\", why should we not look forward to the arrival. There are, aren\'t there, only three things we can do about death: to desire it, to fear it, or to ignore it. The third alternative, which is the one the modern world calls \\"healthy\\" is surely the most uneasy and precarious of all.","Shalt think otherwise when thou hast a man of thine own, I warrant you,\' said the knight, apparently thinking this very funny.","Thanks for my life, my cure, my breakfast - and my lesson.","Laugh and fear not, creatures. Now that you are no longer dumb and witless, you need not always be grave. For jokes as well as justice come in with speech.","I do not think either virginity or old age contemptible, and some of the shrewdest minds I have met inhabited the bodies of old maids.","Friendship is...the sort of love one canimagine between angels.....","I have always found that the Trough periods of the human undulation provide excellent opportunity for all sensual temptations, particularly those of sex. This may surprise you, because, of course, there is more physical energy, and therefore more potential appetite, at the Peak periods; but you must remember that the powers of resistance are then also at their highest. The health and spirits which you... use in producing lust can also... be very easily used for work or play or thought or innocuous merriment. The attack has a much better chance of success when the man\'s whole inner world is drab and cold and empty. And it is also to be noted that the Trough sexuality is subtly different in quality from that of the Peak - much less likely to lead to... \\"being in love,\\" much more easily drawn into perversions, much less... generous and imaginative and even spiritual... It is the same with other desires of the flesh. You are much more likely to make [a] man a sound drunkard by pressing drink on him as an anodyne when he is dull and weary... than... when he is happy...","At schools, the children who are too stupid or lazy to learn languages, mathematics and elementary science can be set to doing the things that children used to do in their spare time. Let them, for example, make mud pies and call it modelling. But all the time there must be no faintest hint that they are inferior to the children who are at work. Whatever nonsense they are engaged in must have\u2014I believe the English already use the phrase\u2014\\"parity of esteem.\\" An even more drastic scheme is not impossible. Children who are fit to proceed to a higher class may be artificially kept back, because the others would get a trauma\u2014Beelzebub, what a useful word!\u2014by being left behind. The bright pupil thus remains democratically fettered to his own age group throughout his school career, and a boy who would be capable of tackling Aeschylus or Dante sits listening to his coeval\'s attempts to spell out \'A Cat Sat On A Mat\'.","You see, I don\'t think age matters so much as people think. Parts of me are still 12 and I think other parts were already 50 when I was 12\u2026.","Some people say it is morbid to be always thinking of one\u2019s own faults. That would be all very well if most of us could stop thinking of our own without soon beginning to think about those of other people. For unfortunately we enjoy thinking about other people\u2019s faults: and in the proper sense of the word \u2018morbid\u2019, that is the most morbid pleasure in the world.","We are arguing like a man who should say, if there were an invisible cat in that empty chair, the chair would look empty; but the chair does look empty; therefore there is an invisible cat in it.","The most pleased of the lot was the other lion, who kept running about everywhere pretending to be very busy but really in order to say to everyone he met, \u201cDid you hear what he said? Us lions. That means him and me. Us lions. That\u2019s what I like about Aslan. No side, no standoffishness. Us lions. That meant him and me. At least he went on saying this till Aslan had loaded him up with three dwarfs, one dryad, two rabbits, and a hedgehog. That steadied him a bit.\u201d","Heaven will solve our problems, but not, I think, by showing us subtle reconciliations between all our apparently contradictory notions. The notions will all be knocked from under our feet. We shall see that there never really was any problem.","I thought I could describe a state; make a map of sorrow. Sorrow, however, turns out to be not a state but a process. It needs not a map but a history, and if I don\'t stop writing that history at some quite arbitrary point, there\'s no reason why I should ever stop. There is something new to be chronicled every day. Grief is like a long valley, a winding valley where any bend may reveal a totally new landscape.","People who know a lot of the same things can hardly help talking about them, and if you\'re there you can hardly help feeling that you\'re out of it.","You can\u2019t see anything properly while your eyes are blurred with tears. You can\u2019t, in most things, get what you want if you want it too desperately: anyway, you can\u2019t get the best out of it. \u2018Now! Let\u2019s have a real good talk\u2019 reduces everyone to silence. \u2018I must get a good sleep tonight\u2019 ushers in hours of wakefulness. Delicious drinks are wastedon a really ravenous thirst. Is it similarly the very intensity of the longing that draws the iron curtain, that makes us feel we are staring into a vacuum when we think about our dead? \u2018Them as asks\u2019 (at any rate \u2018as asks too importunately\u2019) don\u2019t get. Perhapscan\u2019t.","His ideal is a man who, having worked all day for the good of posterity (if that is his vocation), washes his mind of the whole subject, commits the issue to Heaven, and returns at once to the patience or gratitude demanded by the moment that is passing over him. But we want a man hag-ridden by the Future\u2014haunted by visions of an imminent heaven or hell upon earth\u2014ready to break the Enemy\u2019s commands in the present if by so doing we make him think he can attain the one or avert the other\u2014dependent for his faith on the success or failure of schemes whose end he will not live to see. We want a whole race perpetually in pursuit of the rainbow\u2019s end, never honest, nor kind, nor happy now, but always using as mere fuel wherewith to heap the altar of the future every real gift which is offered them in the Present.","No man will love you, though you gave your life for him, unless you have a pretty face. So (might it not be?), the gods will not love you (however you try to pleasure them, and whatever you suffer) unless you have that beauty of soul. In either race. for the love of men or the love of a god, the winners and losers are marked out from birth. We bring our ugliness, in both kinds, with us into the world, with it our destiny.","How can they meet us face to face till we have faces?","Nearly all our older poetry was written and read by men to whom the distinction between poetry and rhetoric, in its modern form, would have been meaningless. The \'beauties\' which they chiefly regarded in every composition were those which we either dislike or simply do not notice.This change of taste makes an invisible wall between us and them.","Die before you die. There is no chance after.","The real job of every moral teacher is to keep bringing us back, time after time, to the old simple principles which we are all so anxious not to see; like bringing a horse back and back to the fence it has refused to jump or bringing a child back to a lesson that it wants to shirk.","Doubtless, by definition, God was Reason itself. But would he also be \\"reasonable\\" [...]","I have found a desire within myself that no experience in this world can satisfy; the most probable explanation is that I was made for another world.","But the detail of the poem shows power akin to genius, and reveals to us that much neglected law of literary history -- that potential genius can never become actual unless it finds or makes the Form which it requires.","When things go wrong, you\u2019ll find they usually go on getting worse for some time; but when things once start going right they often go on getting better and better.","But I must think it is one or the other.\'[Reason]: \'By my father\'s soul, you must not - until you have some evidence. Can you not remain in doubt?\'[John]: \'I don\'t know that I have ever tried.\'[Reason]: \'You must learn to, if you are to come far with me. It is not hard to do it. In Eschropolis, indeed, it is impossible, for the people who live there have to give an opinion once a week or once a day, or else Mr. Mammon would soon cut off their food. But out here in the country you can walk all day and all the next day with an unanswered question in your head: you need never speak until you have made up your mind.","When I was at school one would have said, \'I swear by the Bible.\' But Bibles were not encouraged at Experiment House.","A naturalistic Christianity leaves out all that is specifically Christian.","The good man\u2019s past begins to change so that his forgiven sins and remembered sorrows take on the quality of Heaven: the bad man\u2019s past already conforms to his badness and is filled only with dreariness. And that is why, at the end of all things, when the sun rises here and the twilight turns to blackness down there, the Blessed will say \u201cWe have never lived anywhere except in Heaven, and the Lost, \u201cWe were always in Hell.\u201d And both will speak truly.\u201d","There are only two kinds of people in the end: those who say to God, \u201cThy will be done, and those to whom God says, in the end, \u201cThy will be done.\u201d","A man really ought to say, \u2018The Resurrection happened two thousand years ago\u2019 in the same spirit in which he says, \u2018I saw a crocus yesterday.\u2019 Because we know what is coming behind the crocus.","Now the proper good of a creature is to surrender itself to its Creator - to enact intellectually, volitionally and emotionally, that relationship which is given in the mere fact of its being a creature when it does so, it is good and happy.","Men do not long continue to think what they have forgotten how to say.","The fact that the scientist has succeeded where the magician failed has put such a wide contrast between them in popular thought that the real story of the birth of Science is misunderstood. You will even find people who write about the sixteenth century as if Magic were a medieval survival and Science the new thing that came in to sweep it away. Those who have studied the period know better. There was very little magic in the Middle Ages: the sixteenth and seventeenth centuries are the high noon of magic. The serious magical endeavour and the serious scientific endeavour are twins: one was sickly and died, the other strong and throve. But they were twins. They were born of the same impulse.","He who surrenders himself without reservation to the temporal claims of a nation, or a party, or a class is rendering to Caesar that which, of all things, most emphatically belongs to God: himself.","The old dealt with its pupils as grown birds deal with young birds when they teach them to fly; the new deals with them more as the poultry-keeper deals with young birds \u2014 making them thus or thus for purposes of which the birds know nothing. In a word, the old was a kind of propagation \u2014 men transmitting manhood to men; the new is merely propaganda.","There is either a warning or an encouragement here for every one of us. If you are a nice person\u2014if virtue comes easily to you\u2014beware! Much is expected from those to whom much is given. If you mistake for your own merits what are really God\u2019s gifts to you through nature, and if you are contented with simply being nice, you are still a rebel: and all those gifts will only make your fall more terrible, your corruption more complicated, your bad example more disastrous. The Devil was an archangel once; his natural gifts were as far above yours as yours are above those of a chimpanzee. But","We are bidden to \'put on Christ\', to become like God. That is, whether we like it or not, God intends to give us what we need, not what we now think we want. Once more, we are embarrassed by the intolerable compliment, by too much love, not too little.","I fancy that most of those who think at all have done a great deal of their thinking in the first fourteen years.","The Christian has a great advantage over other men, not by being less fallen than they nor less doomed to live in a fallen world, but by knowing that he IS a fallen man in a fallen world.","The pleasure of novelty is by its very nature more subject than any other to the laws of diminishing returns.","He (Christ) was never regarded as a mere moral teacher. He did not produce that effect on any of the people who actually met Him. He produced mainly three effects \u2013 Hatred \u2013 Terror \u2013 Adoration. There was no trace of people expressing mild approval.","A simpler form of the same objection consists in saying that death ought not to be final, that there ought to be a second chance. I believe that if a million chances were likely to do good, they would be given.","The price of freedom is loneliness. To be happy is to be tied.","No doubt Pain as God\'s megaphone is a terrible instrument; it may lead to final and unrepented rebellion. But it gives the only opportunity the bad man can have for amendment. It removes the veil; it plants the flag of truth within the fortress of a rebel soul.","Every story of conversion is a story of blessed defeat.","Peter, Adam\'s Son,\\" said Father Christmas.\\"Here, sir,\\" said Peter.\\"These are your presents,\\" was the answer, \\"and they are tools, not toys. The time to use them is perhaps near at hand. Bear them well.\\" With these words he handed to Peter a shield and a sword. The shield was the color of silver and across it there ramped a red lion, as bright as a ripe strawberry at the moment when you pick it. The hilt of the sword was of gold and it had a sheath and a sword belt and everything it needed, and it was just the right size and weight for Peter to use. Peter was silent and solemn as he received these gifts, for he felt they were a very serious kind of present.\\"Susan, Eve\'s Daughter,\\" said Father Christmas. \\"These are for you,\\" and he handed her a bow and a quiver full of arrows and a little ivory horn. \\"You must use the bow only in great need,\\" he said, \\"for I do not mean you to fight in the battle. It does not easily miss. And when you put this horn to your lips and blow it, then, wherever you are, I think help of some kind will come to you.\\"Last of all he said, \\"Lucy, Eve\'s Daughter,\\" and Lucy came forward. He gave her a little bottle of what looked like glass (but people said afterwards that it was made of diamond) and a small dagger. \\"In this bottle,\\" he said, \\"there is a cordial made of the juice of one of the fire-flowers that grow on the mountains of the sun. If you or any of your friends is hurt, a few drops of this will restore them. And the dagger is to defend yourself at great need. For you also are not to be in the battle.\\"\\"Why, sir?\\" said Lucy. \\"I think- I don\'t know- but I think I could be brave enough.\\"\\"That is not the point,\\" he said. \\"But battles are ugly when women fight.","Teach him to call it \'real life\' and don\'t let him ask what he means by \'real\'.","The most blessed result of prayer would be to rise thinking \\"But I never knew before. I never dreamed....\\" I suppose it was at such a moment that Thomas Aquinas said of all his own theology, \\"It reminds me of straw.","Oh Adam\u2019s sons, how cleverly you defend yourselves against all that might do you good!","Lucy looked along the beam and presently saw something in it. At first it looked like a cross, then it looked like an aeroplane, then it looked like a kite, and at last with a whirring of wings it was right overhead and was an albatross. It circled three times round the mast and then perched for an instant on the crest of the gilded dragon at the prow. It called out in a strong sweet voice what seemed to be words though no one understood them. After that it spread its wings, rose, and began to fly slowly ahead, bearing a little to starboard. Drinian steered after it not doubting that it offered good guidance. But no one but Lucy knew that as it circled the mast it had whispered to her, \u201cCourage, dear heart, and the voice, she felt sure, was Aslan\u2019s, and with the voice a delicious smell breathed in her face.\u201d","Things like Do Not Steal were, I think, hammered into boys\u2019 heads a good deal harder in those days than they are now. Still, we can never be certain.","Let the thrill go\u2014let it die away\u2014go on through that period of death into the quieter interest and happiness that follow\u2014and you will find you are living in a world of new thrills all the time.","Not that I am (I think) in much danger of ceasing to believe in God. The real danger is coming to believe such dreadful things about Him. The conclusion I dread is not, \'So there\'s no God after all,\' but \'So this is what God\'s really like. Deceive yourself no longer.","I had approached God, or my idea of God, without love, without awe, even without fear. He was, in my mental picture of this miracle, to appear neither as Saviour nor as Judge, but merely as a magician; and when He had done what was required on Him I supposed He would simply \u2013 well, go away. It never crossed my mind that the tremendous contact which I solicited should have any consequences beyond restoring the status quo.","Every Christian is to become a little Christ. The whole purpose of becoming a Christian is simply nothing else.","The best safeguard against bad literature is a full experience of good; just as a real and affectionate acquaintance with honest people gives a better protection against rogues than a habitual distrust of everyone.","What you have made me see,\' answered the Lady, \'is as plain as the sky, but I never saw it before. Yet is has happened every day. One goes into the forest to pick food and already the thought of one fruit rather than another has grown up in one\u2019s mind. Then, may it be, one finds a different fruit and not the fruit one thought of. One joy was expected and another is given. But this I had never noticed before\u2013that the very moment of the finding there is in the mind a kind of thrusting back, or setting aside. The picture of the fruit you have not found is still, for a moment, before you. And if you wished\u2013if it were possible to wish\u2013you could keep it there. You could send your soul after the good you had expected, instead of turning it to the good you had got. You could refuse the real good; you could make the real fruit taste insipid by thinking of the other.","He doesn\u2019t say that we are to forgive other people\u2019s sins provided they are not too frightful, or provided there are extenuating circumstances, or anything of that sort. We are to forgive them all, however spiteful, however mean, however often they are repeated. If we don\u2019t, we shall be forgiven none of our own.","The truth is, he was so glad at being free from his long enchantment that all dangers seemed a game in comparison. But the rest found it an eerie journey.","Why should the separation (if nothing else) which so agonizes the lover who is left behind be painless to the lover who departs?","But the truth is God has not told us His arrangement about the other people are. We do know that no man can be saved except through Christ; we do not know that only those who know Him can be saved through Him.","We have done this through the poets and novelists by persuading the humans that a curious, and usually shortlived, experience which they call \u2018being in love\u2019 is the only respectable ground for marriage; that marriage can, and ought to, render this excitement permanent; and that a marriage which does not do so is no longer binding. This idea is our parody of an idea that came from the Enemy.","I find it hard to take in what anyone says. Or perhaps, hard to want to take it in. It is so uninteresting. Yet I want the others to be about me. I dread the moments when the house is empty. If only they would talk to one another and not to me.","Some people feel guilty about their anxieties and regard them as a defect of faith. I don\u2019t agree at all. They are afflictions, not sins.","In order to pronounce a book bad it is not enough to discover that it elicits no good response from ourselves, for that might be our fault.","God sometimes seems to speak to us most intimately when He catches us, as it were, off our guard. Our preparations to receive Him sometimes have the opposite effect.","Feelings, and feelings, and feelings. Let me try thinking instead. From the rational point of view, what new factor has H\'s death introduced into the problem of the universe? What grounds has it given me for doubting all that I believe? I knew already that these things, and worse, happened daily. I would have said that I had taken them into account. I had been warned--I had warned myself--not to reckon on worldly happiness. We were even promised sufferings. They were part of the program. We were even told, \'Blessed are they that mourn,\' and I accepted it. I\'ve got nothing that I hadn\'t bargained for. Of course, it is different when the thing happens to oneself, not to others, and in reality, not in imagination. Yes, but should it, for a sane man, make quite such a difference as this? No. And it wouldn\'t for a man whose faith had been real faith and whose concern for other people\'s sorrow had been real concern. The case is too plain. If my house has collapsed at one blow, that is because it was a house of cards. The faith that \'took these things into account\' was not faith but imagination....I thought I trusted the rope until it mattered to me whether it would bear me. Now it matters, and I find it didn\'t.","Don\'t you understand anything? Isn\'t it absolutely essential to keep a fierce Left and a fierce Right both on their toes and each terrified of the other? That\'s how we get things done. Of course we\'re non-political. The real power always is.","If they won\u2019t write the kind of books we like to read, we shall have to write them ourselves.","Failures, repeated failures, are finger posts on the road to achievement. One fails forward towards success.","Time is the very lens through which ye see--small and clear, as men see through the wrong end of a telescope--something that would otherwise be too big for ye to see at all.","Light itself was your first love: you paint only as a means of telling about light... Ink and catgut and paint were necessary down there, but they are also dangerous stimulants. Every poet and musician and artist, but for Grace, is drawn away from love of the thing he tells, to love of the telling till, down in Deep Hell, they cannot be interested in God at all but only what they say about Him.","But length of days with an evil heart is only length of misery","an author should never conceive himself as bringing into existence beauty or wisdom which did not exist before, but simply and solely as trying to embody in terms of his own art some reflection of eternal Beauty and Wisdom.","Why, then, did God give them free will? Because free will, though it makes evil possible, is also the only thing that makes possible any love or goodness or joy worth having.","When man comes into the presence of God he will find, whether he wishes it or not, that all those things which seemed to make him so different from the men of other times, or even from his earlier self, have fallen off. He is back where he always was, where every man always is.","You could send your soul after the good you had expected, instead of turning it to the good you had got. You could refuse the real good; you could make the real fruit taste insipid by thinking of the other.","I have seen landscapes...which, under a particular light, made me feel that at any moment a giant might raise his head over the next ridge. Nature has that in her which compels us to invent giants: and only giants will do.","Those who run first do not always run last,","To me, re-reading my favorite books is like spending time with my best friends.I\u2019d never be satisfied to limit myself to just one experience each with my favorite people.","All the stars were falling: Aslan had called them home.","All right, I said murder and I\'ll say it again as often as I like, so keep your hair on...","The gods, not out of mercy, have made me strong.","you know how it feels if you begin hoping for something that you want desperately badly; you almost fight against the hope because it is too good to be true; you\u2019ve been disappointed so often before.","It burned me from within. It quickened; I was with book, as a woman is with child.","But fie on gravity!","The reader who finds these three episodes of no interest need read this book no further, for in a sense the central story of my life is about nothing else. For those who are still disposed to proceed I will only underline the quality common to the three experiences; it is that of an unsatisfied desire which is itself more desirable than any other satisfaction. I call it Joy, which is here a technical term and must be sharply distinguished both from Happiness and from Pleasure. Joy (in my sense) has indeed one characteristic, and one only, in common with them; the fact that anyone who has experienced it will want it again. Apart from that, and considered only in its quality, it might almost equally well be called a particular kind of unhappiness or grief. But then it is a kind we want. I doubt whether anyone who has tasted it would ever, if both were in his power, exchange it for all the pleasures in the world. But then Joy is never in our power and pleasure often is. I","Of course the cat will growl and spit at the operator and bite him if she can. But the real question is whether he is a vet or a vivisector.","For I need not remind such an audience as this that the neat sorting out of books into age-groups, so dear to publishers, has only a very sketchy relation with the habits of any real readers. Those of us who are blamed when old for reading childish books were blamed when children for reading books too old for us. No reader worth his salt trots along in obedience to a time-table.","People who have not been in Narnia sometimes think that a thing cannot be good and terrible at the same time. If","It is after you have realized that there is a real Moral Law, and a Power behind the law, and that you have broken that law and put yourself wrong with that Power\u2014it is after all this, and not a moment sooner, that Christianity begins to talk.","God is easy to please, but hard to satisfy.","Now it is time!\\" then louder, \\"Time!\\"; and then so loud it could have shaken the stars; \\"TIME.\\" The door flew open.","One last point. Remember that, as I said, the right direction leads not only to peace but to knowledge. When a man is getting better he understands more and more clearly the evil that is still left in him. When a man is getting worse, he understands his own badness less and less. A moderately bad man knows he is not very good: a thoroughly bad man thinks he is all right. This is common sense, really. You understand sleep when you are awake, not when you are sleeping. You can see mistakes in arithmetic when your mind is working properly: while you are making them you cannot see them. You can understand the nature of drunkenness when you are sober, not when you are drunk. Good people know about both good and evil: bad people do not know about either.","fallen man is not simply an imperfect creature who needs improvement: he is a rebel who must lay down his arms.","Gran parte de una desgracia cualquiera consiste, por as\xed decirlo, en la sombra de la desgracia, en la reflexi\xf3n sobre ella. Es decir en el hecho de que no se limite uno a sufrir, sino que se vea obligado a seguir considerando el hecho de que sufre.","no one can mark the exact moment at which friendship becomes love.","He had never dreamed that the country of which she would make him king (king in name but really a slave) was his own country.","He was only too well aware that such resolutions might look very different when the moment came, but he felt an unwonted assurance that somehow or other he would be able to go through with it. It was necessary, and the necessary was always possible.","Eustace stood with his heart beating terribly, hoping and hoping that he would be brave.","Thought is what we start from: the simple, intimate, immediate datum. Matter is the inferred thing, the mystery.","I don\'t see how any degree of faith can exclude the dismay, since Christ\'s faith did not save Him from dismay in Gethsemane. We are not necessarily doubting that God will do the best for us: we are wondering how painful the best will turn out to be.","The weakest of my people does not fear death. It is the Bent One, the lord of your world, who wastes your lives and befouls them with flying from what you know will overtake you in the end. If you were the subjects of Maleldil you would have peace. p. 140","Everyone has noticed how hard it is to turn to God when everything is going well for us. We \'have all we want\' is a terrible saying when \'all\' does not include God. We find God an interruption.","The Divine \\"goodness\\" differs from ours, but it is not sheerly different; it differs from ours not as white from black, but as a perfect circle from a child\'s first attempt to draw a wheel. But when the child has learned to draw, it will know that the circle it then makes is what it was trying to make from the very beginning.","Today I had to meet a man I haven\'t seen for ten years. And all that time I had thought I was remembering him well- how he looked and spoke and the sort of things he said. The first five minutes of the real man shattered the image completely. Not that he had changed. On the contrary. I kept on thinking, \\"Yes, of course, of course. I\'d forgotten that he thought that- or disliked this, or knew so-and-so- or jerked his head back that way.\\" I had known all these things once and I recognized them the moment I met them again. But they had all faded out of my mental picture of him, and when they were all replaced by his actual presence the total effect was quite astonishingly different from the image I had carried about with me for those ten years. How can I hope that this will not happen to my memory of H.? That it is not happening already? Slowly, quietly, like snow-flakes- like the small flakes that come when it is going to snow all night- little flakes of me, my impressions, my selections, are settling down on the image of her. The real shape will be quite hidden in the end. Ten minutes- ten seconds- of the real H. would correct all this. And yet, even if those ten seconds were allowed me, one second later the little flakes would begin to fall again. The rough, sharp, cleansing tang of her otherness is gone.","Now, it may surprise you to learn that in His efforts to get permanent possession of a soul, [God] relies on the troughs even more than on the peaks; some of His special favorites have gone through longer and deeper troughs than anyone else... It is during such trough periods, much more than during the peak periods, that it is growing into the sort of creature He wants it to be... He wants them to learn to walk and must therefore take away His hand; and if only the will to walk is really there He is pleased even with their stumbles.","If we will not learn to eat the only food that the universe grows-the only food that any possible universe ever can grow-then we must starve eternally.","No warrior scolds. Courteous words or else hard knocks are his only language.","There are no ordinary people. You have never spoken to a mere mortal. Natures, civilizations, cultures, arts, these are mortal. But it is with immortals that we work, joke, snub, marry, exploit.","If we really want to learn how to forgive, perhaps we had better start with something easier than the Gestapo.","Truth is always about something, but reality is that about which truth is\\".","Those of us who are blamed when old for reading childish books were blamed when children for reading books too old for us. No reader worth his salt trots along in obedience to a time-table.","Nature never taught me that there exists a God of glory and of infinite majesty. I had to learn that in other ways. But nature gave the word \\"glory\\" a meaning for me.","And if an infinitely wise Being listens to the requests of finite and foolish creatures, of course He will sometimes grant and sometimes refuse them.","The first condition, then, of what is called a selfish love among men is lacking with God. He has no natural necessities, no passion, to compete with His wish for the beloved\'s welfare; or if there is in Him something which we have to imagine after the analogy of a passion, a want it is there by His own will and for our sakes. And the second condition is lacking too. The real interests of a child may differ from that which his father\'s affection instinctively demands, because the child is a separate being from the father with a nature which has its own needs and does not exist solely for the father nor find its whole perfection in being loved by him and which the father does not fully understand. But creatures are not thus separate from their Creator, nor can He misunderstand them. The place for which He designs them in His scheme of things is the place they are made for. When they reach it their nature is fulfilled and their happiness attained: a broken bone in the universe has been set, the anguish is over. When we want to be something other than the thing God wants us to be, we must be wanting what, in fact, will not make us happy. Those Divine demands which sound to our natural ears most like those of a despot and least like those of a lover, in fact marshal us where we should want to go, if we knew what we wanted. He demands our worship, our obedience, our prostration.","When things go wrong, you\u2019ll find they usually go in getting worse for some time; but when things once start going right they often go on getting better and better.","Wrong will be right, when Aslan comes in sight, At the sound of his roar, sorrows will be no more, When he bares his teeth, winter meets its death, And when he shakes his mane, we shall have spring again. You","And so to my fool\'s bed. What was that? No, no, not a girl crying in the garden. No one, cold, hungry, and banished, was shivering there, longing and not daring to come in. It was the chains swinging at the well. It would be folly to get up and go out and call again: Psyche, Psyche, my only love. I am a great queen. I have killed a man. I am drunk like a man. All warriors drink deep after the battle. Bardia\'s lips on my hand were like the touch of lightning. All great princes have mistresses and lovers. There\'s the crying again. No, it\'s only the buckets at the well. \\"Shut the window, Poobi. To your bed, child. Do you love me, Poobi? Kiss me good night. Good night.\\" The king\'s dead. He\'ll never pull my hair again. A straight thrust and then a cut in the leg. That would have killed him. I am the Queen; I\'ll kill Orual too.","Luckily Shasta had lived all his life too far south in Calormen to have heard the tales that were whispered in Tashbaan about a dreadful Narnian demon that appeared in the form of a lion. And of course he knew none of the true stories about Aslan, the great Lion, the son of the Emperor-beyond-the-Sea, the HIgh King above all high kings in Narnia. But after one glance at the Lion\'s face he slipped out of the saddle and fell at its feet. He couldn\'t say anything but then he didn\'t want to say anything, and he knew he needn\'t say anything.The High King above all kings stooped towards him. Its mane, and some strange and solemn perfume that hung about the mane, was all round him. It touched his forehead with its tongue. He lifted his face and their eyes met. Then instantly the pale brightness of the mist and fiery brightness of the Lion rolled themselves together into a swirling glory and gathered themselves up and disappeared. He was alone with the horse on a grassy hillside under a blue sky. And there were birds singing.","An open mind, in questions that are not ultimate, is useful. But an open mind about the ultimate foundations either of Theoretical or of Practical Reason is idiocy. If a man\u2019s mind is open on these things, let his mouth at least be shut.","Well, this is extremely interesting,\u2019 said the Episcopal Ghost. \u2018It\u2019s a point of view. Certainly, it\u2019s a point of view. In the meantime\u2026\u2019 \u2018There is no meantime,\u2019 replied the other. \u2018All that is over. We are not playing now. I have been talking of the past (your past and mine) only in order that you may turn from it forever. One wrench and the tooth will be out. You can begin as if nothing had ever gone wrong.

Will you, even now, repent and believe?\u2019 \u2018I\u2019m not sure that I\u2019ve got the exact point you are trying to make,\u2019 said the Ghost. \u2018I am not trying to make any point,\u2019 said the Spirit. \u2018I am telling you to repent and believe.\u2019 \u2018But my dear boy, I believe already. We may not be perfectly agreed, but you have completely misjudged me if you do not realise that my religion is a very real and a very precious thing to me.\u2019 \u2018Very well,\u2019 said the other, as if changing his plan. \u2018Will you believe in me?\u2019 \u2018In what sense?\u2019 \u2018Will you come with me to the mountains? It will hurt at first, until your feet are hardened. Reality is harsh to the feet of shadows. But will you come?\u2019 \u2018Well, that is a plan. I am perfectly ready to consider it. Of course I should require some assurances\u2026I should want a guarantee that you are taking me to a place where I shall find a wider sphere of usefulness\u2014and scope for the talents that God has given me\u2014and an atmosphere of free inquiry\u2014in short, all that one means by civilisation and\u2014er\u2014the spiritual life.\u2019 \u2018No,\u2019 said the other. \u2018I can promise you none of these things. No sphere of usefulness: you are not needed there at all. No scope for your talents: only forgiveness for having perverted them. No atmosphere of inquiry, for I will bring you to the land not of questions but of answers, and you shall see the face of God.","There are progressions in which the last step is sui generis - incommensurable with the others - and in which to go the whole way is to undo all the labour of your previous journey. To reduce the Tao to a mere natural product is a step of that kind. Up to that point, the kind of explanation which explains things away may give us something, though at a heavy cost. But you cannot go on \u2018explaining away\u2019 for ever: you will find that you have explained explanation itself away. You cannot go on \u2018seeing through\u2019 things for ever. The whole point of seeing through something is to see something through it. It is good that the window should be transparent, because the street or garden beyond it is opaque. How if you saw through the garden too? It is no use trying to \u2018see through\u2019 first principles. If you see through everything, then everything is transparent. But a wholly transparent world is an invisible world. To \u2018see through\u2019 all things is the same as not to see.","How much better for us if all humans died in costly nursing homes amid doctors who lie, nurses who lie, friends who lie, as we have trained them, promising life to the dying, encouraging the belief that sickness excuses every indulgence, and even, if our workers know their job, withholding all suggestion of a priest lest it should betray to the sick man his true condition!","He had not yet learned that sometimes your reward for doing one task well is to be set with a harder and better one.","This world is bursting with life for these few days because the song with which I called it into life still hangs in the air and rumbles in the ground. It will not be so for long. But I cannot tell that to this old sinner, and I cannot comfort him either; he has made himself unable to hear my voice. If I spoke to him, he would hear only growlings and roarings. Oh Adam\u2019s sons, how cleverly you defend yourselves against all that might do you good! But I will give him the only gift he is still able to receive.","Sexual intercourse is rapidly becoming the one thing venerated in a world without veneration.","I have been talking of the past (your past and mine) only in order that you may turn from it forever. One wrench and the tooth will be out. You can begin as if nothing had ever gone wrong. White as snow.","But we inherit a whole system of desires which do not necessarily contribute God\'s will but which, after centuries of usurped autonomy steadfastly ignore it. If the thing we like doing is, in fact, the thing God wants us to do, yet that is not our reason for doing it; it remains a mere happy coincidence. We cannot therefore know that we are acting at all, or primarily, for God\'s sake, unless the material of the action is contrary to our inclination or (in other words) painful and what we cannot know that we are choosing, we cannot choose. The full acting out of the self\'s surrender to God therefore demands pain: this action, to be perfect, must be done from the pure will to obey in the absence, or in the teeth, of inclination. How impossible it is to enact the surrender of the self by doing what we like...","Most people, if they had really learned to look into their own hearts, would know that they do want, and want acutely, something that cannot be had in this world.","But I want her, I must have her, I shall die if I do not get her - false, proud, black-hearted daughter of a dog that she is!

That thing is Freedom: the gift whereby ye most resemble your Maker and are yourselves parts of eternal reality. But ye can see it only through the lens of Time, in a little clear picture, through the inverted telescope. It is a picture of moments following one another and yourself in each moment making some choice that might have been otherwise.","Turn God\u2019s wrath into mere enlightened disapproval, and you also turn His love into mere humanitarianism.","I belong here.

Knowledge can last, principles can last, habits can last; but feelings come and go.","To the Materialist things like nations, classes, civilizations must be more important than individuals, because the individuals live only seventy odd years each and the group may last for centuries. But to the Christian, individuals are more important, for they live eternally; and races, civilizations and the like, are in comparison the creatures of a day.","We want cattle who can finally become food; He wants servants who can finally become sons. We want to suck in, He wants to give out. We are empty and would be filled; He is full and flows over. Our war aim is a world in which Our Father Below has drawn all other beings into himself: the Enemy wants a world full of beings united to Him but still distinct.","The grand point is not to wear the garb, nor use the brogue of religion, but to process the life of God within, and feel and think as Jesus would have done because of that inner life. Small is the value of extended religion, unless it is the outcome of a life within.","a creature who has kept a planet in its orbit for several billions of years will be able to manage a packing case!","That was what it felt like - as if one had always been in that place and never been bored although nothing had ever happened.","It is not fore nothing that you are named Ransom.","Yet I have often noticed since how much less stir nearly everyone\'s death makes than you might expect.

Just as it is easy to think the State has a lot of different objects\u2014military, political, economic, and what not. But in a way things are much simpler than that. The State exists simply to promote and to protect the ordinary happiness of human beings in this life. A husband and wife chatting over a fire, a couple of friends having a game of darts in a pub, a man reading a book in his own room or digging in his own garden\u2014that is what the State is there for. And unless they are helping to increase and prolong and protect such moments, all the laws, parliaments, armies, courts, police, economics, etc., are simply a waste of time. In the same way the Church exists for nothing else but to draw men into Christ, to make them little Christs. If they are not doing that, all the cathedrals, clergy, missions, sermons, even the Bible itself, are simply a waste of time.","There is nothing progressive about being pigheaded and refusing to admit a mistake. And I think if you look at the present state of the world, it is pretty plain that humanity has been making some big mistake. We are on the wrong road. And if that is so, we must go back. Going back is the quickest way on.","What do we really know of other people\'s souls. Of their struggles, dreams, or tempations.

To say the patient is getting over it after an operation for appendicitis is one thing; after he\'s had his leg off it is quite another. After that operation either the wounded stump heals or the man dies. If it heals, the fierce, continuous pain will stop. Presently he\'ll get back his strength and be able to stump about on his wooden leg. He has \'got over it.\' But he will probably have recurrent pains in the stump all his life, and perhaps pretty bad ones; and he will always be a one-legged man. There will be hardly any moment when he forgets it. Bathing, dressing, sitting down and getting up again, even lying in bed, will all be different. His whole way of life will be changed. All sorts of pleasures and activities that he once took for granted will have to be simply written off. Duties too. At present I am learning to get about on crutches. Perhaps I shall presently be given a wooden leg. But I shall never be a biped again.","All things (e.g. a camel\'s journey through A needle\'s eye) are possible, it\'s true.But picture how the camel feels, squeezed outIn one long bloody thread, from tail to snout.","Why, if you are interested in the country only for the sake of painting it, you\'ll never learn to see the country.","It was necessary, and the necessary was always possible.","Only five minutes later he noticed a dozen crocuses growing round the foot of an old tree- gold and purple and white. Then came a sound even more delicious than the sound of water. Close beside the path they were following, a bird suddenly chirped from the branch of a tree. It was answered by the chuckle of another bird a little further off. And then, as if that had been a signal, there was chattering and chirruping in every direction, and then a moment of full song, and within five minutes the whole wood was ringing with birds\' music, and wherever Edmund\'s eyes turned he saw birds alighting on branches, or sailing overhead or chasing one another or having their little quarrels or tidying up their feathers with their beaks.\\"Faster! Faster!\\" said the Witch.There was no trace of the fog now. The sky became bluer and bluer, and now there were white clouds hurrying across it from time to time. In the wide glades there were primroses. A light breeze sprang up which scattered drops of moisture from the swaying branches and carried cool, delicious scents against the faces of the travelers. The trees began to come fully alive. The larches and birches were covered with green, the laburnums with gold. Soon the beech trees had put forth their delicate, transparent leaves. As the travelers walked under them the light also became green. A bee buzzed crossed their path.","In my experience it is Affection that creates this taste, teaching us first to notice, then to endure, then to smile at, then to enjoy, and finally to appreciate, the people who \u201chappen to be there.","On the one hand, if God is wiser than we His judgement must differ from ours on many things, and not least on good and evil.

The more often he feels without acting, the less he will ever be able to act, and, in the long run, the less he will be able to feel.","For the critics who think Chesterton frivolous or \'paradoxical\' I have to work hard to feel even pity; sympathy is out of the question.","Thus Tyrants could practice, in a sense, \u201cdemocracy. But now \u201cdemocracy\u201d can do the same work without any tyranny other than her own.\u201d","If you make the adults of today Christian, the children of tomorrow will receive a Christian education. What a society has, that, be sure, and nothing else, it will hand on to its young.","You will remember how, as a schoolboy, I had destroyed my religious life by a vicious subjectivism which made \'realizations\' the aim of prayer; turning away from God to seek states of mind, and trying to produce those states of mind by \'maistry\'.","Strengthen the feebler, lighten the darker, love all.","My aim was to build up more and more that strength, hard and joyless, which had come to me when I heard the god\'s sentence; by learning, fighting, and labouring, to drive all the woman out of me.","This is the reason why you were brought to Narnia, that by knowing me here for a little you might come to know me better there\\".-Aslan, Voyage of the Dawn Treader","And Aslan was bigger and more beautiful and more brightly golden and more terrible than he had thought.

The same leg is cut off time after time. The first plunge of the knife into the flesh is felt again and again.","Do not waste time bothering whether you \u2018love\u2019 your neighbor; act as if you did. When you are behaving as if you loved someone, you will presently come to love him. If you injure someone you dislike, you will find yourself disliking him more. If you do him a good turn, you will find yourself disliking him less. There is, indeed one exception. If you do him a good turn, not to please God and obey the law of charity, but to show him what a fine, forgiving chap you are, and to put him in your debt, and then sit down to wait for his \u2018gratitude\u2019, you will probably be disappointed. (People are not fools: they have a very quick eye for showing off, or patronage.) But whenever we do good to another self, just because it is a self, made (like us) by God and desiring its own happiness as we desire ours, we shall have learned to love it a little more, or at least to dislike it less....Some writers use the word charity to describe not only Christian love between human beings, but also God\u2019s love for man and man\u2019s love for God. About the second of these two, people are often worried. They are told they ought to love God. They cannot find any such feeling in them selves. What are they to do? The answer is the same as before. Act as if you did. Do not sit trying to manufacture feelings. Ask yourself, \u201cIf I were sure that I loved God what would I do? When you have found the answer, go and do it.","Si se sigue adelante, la desaparici\xf3n de la primera emoci\xf3n ser\xe1 compensada por un inter\xe9s m\xe1s sosegado y duradero.

Not to acquire a taste for the realistic is childish in the bad sense; to have lost the taste for marvels and adventures is no more a matter for congratulation than losing our teeth, our hair, our palate, and finally, our hopes.

It is your business to see that the patient never thinks of the present fear as his appointed cross, but only of the things he is afraid of. Let him regard them as his crosses: let him forget that, since they are incompatible, they cannot all happen to him, and let him try to practise fortitude and patience to them all in advance.

And is it not pretty to notice how Democracy (in the incantatory sense) is now doing for us the work that was once done by the most ancient Dictatorships, and by the same methods? You remember how one of the Greek Dictators (they called them \u2018tyrants\u2019 then) sent an envoy to another Dictator to ask his advice about the principles of government. The second Dictator led the envoy into a field of corn, and there he snicked off with his cane the top of every stalk that rose an inch or so above the general level. The moral was plain. Allow no pre-eminence among your subjects. Let no man live who is wiser, or better, or more famous, or even handsomer than the mass. Cut them all down to a level; all slaves, all ciphers, all nobodies. All equals. Thus Tyrants could practise, in a sense, \u2018democracy\u2019. But now \u2018democracy\u2019 can do the same work without any other tyranny than her own. No one need now go through the field with a cane. The little stalks will now of themselves bite the tops off the big ones. The big ones are beginning to bite off their own in their desire to Be Like Stalks.","A girl should be so lost in God that a man has to seek Him to find her.","I think every one who has some vague belief in God, until he becomes a Christian, has the idea of an exam, or of a bargain in his mind. The first result of real Christianity is to blow that idea into bits. When they find it blown into bits, some people think this means that Christianity is a failure and give up. They seem to imagine that God is very simple-minded! In fact, of course, He knows all about this. One of the very things Christianity was designed to do was to blow this idea to bits. God has been waiting for the moment at which you discover that there is no question of earning a pass mark in this exam, or putting Him in your debt.Then comes another discovery. Every faculty you have, your power of thinking or of moving your limbs from moment to moment, is given you by God. If you devoted every moment of your whole life exclusively to His service you could not give Him anything that was not in a sense His own already. So that when we talk of a man doing anything for God or giving anything to God, I will tell you what it is really like.It is like a small child going to its father and saying, \\"Daddy, give me sixpence to buy you a birthday present.\\" Of course, the father does, and he is pleased with the child\'s present. It is all very nice and proper, but only an idiot would think that the father is sixpence to the good on the transaction. When a man has made these two discoveries God can really get to work. It is after this that real life begins. The man is awake now.","God is the only comfort, He is also the supreme terror: the thing we most need and the thing we most want to hide from.

But our merriment must be of that kind (and it is, in fact, the merriest kind) which exists between people who have, from the outset, taken each other seriously - no flippancy, no superiority, no presumption. And our charity must be real and costly love, with deep feelings for the sins in spite of which we love the sinner - no mere tolerance, or indulgence which parodies love as flippancy parodies merriment.

Not everyone has this disease; those who have will know what I mean. I once tried to describe it in a novel.

It is probably this passion, more even than the desire for power, which makes magicians.","It is better to be Socrates dissatisfied than a pig satisfied.","Some modern theologians have, quite rightly, protested against an excessively moralistic interpretation of Christianity. The Holiness of God is something more and other than moral perfection: His claim upon us is something more and other than the claims of moral duty. I do not deny it: But this conception, like that of corporate guilt, is very easily used as an evasion of the real issue. God may be more than moral goodness: He is not less. The road to the promised land runs past Sinai. The moral law may exist to be transcended, but there is no transcending it for those who have not first admitted its claims upon them, and then tried with all their strength to meet that claim, and fairly and squarely face the fact of their failure.","Wouldn\u2019t he know without being asked? said Polly. \u201cI\u2019ve no doubt he would,\u201d said the Horse (still with his mouth full). \u201cBut I\u2019ve a sort of idea he likes to be asked.\u201d","Envy, bleating \'I\'m as good as you\', is the hotbed of Fascism.","ONCE THERE WERE FOUR CHILDREN WHOSE NAMES were Peter, Susan, Edmund and Lucy.

There is in our present pilgrim condition plenty of room (more room than most of us like) for abstinence and renunciation and mortifying our natural desires. But behind all asceticism the thought should be, \u2018Who will trust us with the true wealth if we cannot be trusted even with the wealth that perishes?\u2019 Who will trust me with a spiritual body if I cannot control even an earthly body? These small and perishable bodies we now have were given to us as ponies are given to schoolboys. We must learn to manage: not that we may some day be free of horses altogether but that some day we may ride bare-back, confident and rejoicing, those greater mounts, those winged, shining and world- shaking horses which perhaps even now expect us with impatience, pawing and snorting in the King\u2019s stables.

The reasons are obvious. In the first place the parochial organization should always be attacked, because, being a unity of place and not of likings, it brings people of different classes and psychology together in the kind of unity the [Lord] desires... In the second place, the search for a \\"suitable\\" church makes the man a critic where the [Lord] wants him to be a pupil.","I perceived now that there is a love deeper than theirs who seek only the happiness of their beloved. Would a father see his daughter happy as a whore? Would a woman see her lover happy as a coward?","To anticipate the Enemy\u2019s strategy, we must consider His aims. The Enemy wants to bring the man to a state of mind in which he could design the best cathedral in the world, and know it to be the best, and rejoice in the fact, without being any more (or less) or otherwise glad at having done it than he would be if it had been done by another. The Enemy wants him, in the end, to be so free from any bias in his own favour that he can rejoice in his own talents as frankly and gratefully as in his neighbour\u2019s talents\u2014or in a sunrise, an elephant, or a waterfall. He wants each man, in the long run, to be able to recognise all creatures (even himself) as glorious and excellent things. He wants to kill their animal self-love as soon as possible; but it is His long-term policy, I fear, to restore to them a new kind of self-love\u2014a charity and gratitude for all selves, including their own; when they have really learned to love their neighbours as themselves, they will be allowed to love themselves as their neighbours.","He had not yet learned that if you do one good deed your reward usually is to be set to do another and harder and better one.","If He, who in Himself can lack nothing, chooses to need us, it is because we need to be needed.","It is very foolish to shut oneself into any wardrobe.","And when they looked at her they thought that they had never before known what beauty meant.","There is a paradox about tribulation in Christianity. Blessed are the poor, but by judgement (i.e., social justice) and alms we are to remove poverty wherever possible. Blessed are we when persecuted, but we may avoid persecution by flying city to city, and may pray to be spared it as. Our Lord prayed in Gethsemane. But if suffering is good, ought it not to be pursued rather than avoided? I answer that suffering is not good in itself. What is good in any painful experience is for the sufferer, his submission to the will of God, and for the spectators, the compassion aroused and the acts of mercy to which it leads. In the fallen and partially redeemed universe, we may distinguish (1) the simple good descending from God, (2) the simple evil produced by rebellious creatures, and (3) the exploitation of that evil by God for His redemptive purpose, which produces (4) the complex good out of simple evil does not excuse - though by mercy it may save -- those who do simple evil. And this distinction is central. Offences must come, but woe to those whom they come; sins do cause grace to abound, but we must not make that excuse for continuing to sin. The crucifixion itself is the best, as well as the worst, of all historical events, but the role of Judas remains simply evil...For you will certainly carry out God\'s purpose, however you act, but it makes a difference to you whether you serve like Judas or like John.","Because we love something else more than this world we love even this world better than those who know no other.","He\'s a hedonist at heart.

He has filled His world full of pleasures.","If anything is to exist at all, then the Original Thing must be, not a principle nor a generality, much less an \u2018ideal\u2019 or a \u2018value\u2019, but an utterly concrete fact.","Ransom was by now thoroughly frightened\u2014not with the prosaic fright that a man suffers in a war, but with a heady, bounding kind of fear that was hardly distinguishable from his general excitement: he was poised on a sort of emotional watershed from which, he felt, he might at any moment pass either into delirious terror or into an ecstasy of joy.","\u0644\u0627 \u0623\u062a\u062e\u064a\u0644 \u0623\u0646 \u0647\u0646\u0627\u0643 \u0645\u0646 \u064a\u0633\u062a\u0645\u062a\u0639 \u062c\u062f\u0627\u064b \u0628\u0643\u062a\u0627\u0628 .. \u0648\u064a\u0642\u0631\u0623\u0647 \u0645\u0631\u0629 \u0648\u0627\u062d\u062f\u0629 !!\u0640","Hate obscures all distinctions.","It was quite unlike any other party they had seen that day. The crier who went before it shouting, \u201cWay, way! was the only Calormene in it. And there was no litter; everyone was on foot. There were about half a dozen men and Shasta had never seen anyone like them before. For one thing, they were all as fair-skinned as himself, and most of them had fair hair. And they were not dressed like men of Calormen. Most of them had legs bare to the knee. Their tunics were of fine, bright, hardy colours \u2013 woodland green, or gay yellow, or fresh blue. Instead of turbans they wore steel or silver caps, some of them set with jewels, and one with little wings on each side of it. A few were bare-headed. The swords at their sides were long and straight, not curved like Calormene scimitars. And instead of being grave and mysterious like most Calormenes, they walked with a swing and let their arms and shoulders go free, and chatted and laughed. One was whistling. You could see that they were ready to be friends with anyone who was friendly, and didn\u2019t give a fig for anyone who wasn\u2019t. Shasta thought he had never seen anything so lovely in his life.\u201d","An important spiritual law is here involved. I have explained that you can weaken his prayers by diverting his attention from the Enemy Himself to his own states of mind about the Enemy. On the other hand fear becomes easier to master when the patient\u2019s mind is diverted from the thing feared to the fear itself, considered as a present and undesirable state of his own mind; and when he regards the fear as his appointed cross he will inevitably think of it as a state of mind. One can therefore formulate the general rule; in all activities of mind which favour our cause, encourage the patient to be unself-conscious and to concentrate on the object, but in all activities favourable to the Enemy bend his mind back on itself.","Suppose we have only dreamed, or made up, all those things - trees and grass and sun and moon and stars and Aslan himself. Suppose we have. Then all I can say is that, in that case, the made-up things seem a great deal more important than the real ones... That\'s why I\'m going to stand by the the play-world. I\'m on Aslan\'s side even if there isn\'t any Aslan to lead it. I\'m going to live as a like a Narnian as I can even if there isn\'t any Narnia.","Now that he was navigating, his celestial mood was shattered. Wild, animal thirst for life, mixed with homesick longing for the free airs and the sights and smells of earth-for grass and meat and beer and tea and the human voice-awoke in him.","I should like to distinguish two things which are very often confused. The Christian conception of marriage is one: the other is the quite different question--how far Christians, if they are voters or Members of Parliament, ought to try to force their views of marriage on the rest of the community by embodying them in the divorce laws. A great many people seem to think that if you are a Christian yourself, you should try to make divorce difficult for every one. I do not think that. At least I know I should be very angry if the Mohammedans tried to prevent the rest of us from drinking wine. My own view is that the Churches should frankly recognize that the majority of the British people are not Christians and, therefore, cannot be expected to live Christian lives. There ought to be two distinct kinds of marriage: one governed by the State with rules enforced on all citizens, the other governed by the Church with rules enforced by her on her own members. This distinction ought to be quite sharp, so that a man knows which couples are married in a Christian sense and which are not.","And suddenly there came a breeze from the east, tossing the top of the wave into foamy shapes and ruffling the smooth water all round them. It lasted only a second or so but what it brought them in that second none of those three children will ever forget. It brought both a smell and a sound, a musical sound. Edmund and Eustace would never talk about it afterwareds. Lucy could only say, \\"It would break your heart.\\" \\"Why,\\" said I, \\"was it so sad?\\" \\"Sad!! No,\\" said Lucy.","Man with his new powers became rich like Midas but all that he touched had gone dead and cold.","It is simply no good trying to keep any thrill: that is the very worst thing you can do. Let the thrill go\u2014let it die away\u2014go on through that period of death into the quieter interest and happiness that follow\u2014and you will find you are living in a world of new thrills all the time. But if you decide to make thrills your regular diet and try to prolong them artificially, they will all get weaker and weaker, and fewer and fewer, and you will be a bored, disillusioned old man for the rest of your life.","It is often impossible to find out either party\u2019s real wishes; with luck, they end by doing something that neither wants, while each feels a glow of self-righteousness and harbours a secret claim to preferential treatment for the unselfishness shown and a secret grudge against the other for the ease with which the sacrifice has been accepted.","Don\'t judge a man by where he is, because you don\'t know how far he has come","The sight of his great valour and of the extremity of his passion might incline her heart to him.","if you do not listen to Theology, that will not mean that you have no ideas about God. It will mean that you have a lot of wrong ones\u2014bad, muddled, out-of-date ideas. For a great many of the ideas about God which are trotted out as novelties today are simply the ones which real Theologians tried centuries ago and rejected.","I am inclined to think a Christian would be wise to avoid, where he decently can, any meeting with people who are bullies, lascivious, cruel, dishonest, spiteful and so forth.","Everyone will have noticed how the Old Testament seems at times to ignore our conception of the individual.","To us a human is primarily food; our aim is the absorption of its will into ours, the increase of our own area of selfhood at its expense. But the obedience which the Enemy demands of men is quite a different thing. One must face the fact that all the talk about His love for men, and His service being perfect freedom, is not (as one would gladly believe) mere propaganda, but an appalling truth. He really does want to fill the universe with a lot of loathsome little replicas of Himself\u2014creatures whose life, on its miniature scale, will be qualitatively like His own, not because He has absorbed them but because their wills freely conform to His. We want cattle who can finally become food; He wants servants who can finally become sons. We want to suck in, He wants to give out. We are empty and would be filled; He is full and flows over. Our war aim is a world in which Our Father Below has drawn all other beings into himself: the Enemy wants a world full of beings united to Him but still distinct. And","He does not think God will love us because we are good, but that God will make us good because He loves us;","Got to start by finding it, have we?\\" answered Puddleglum. \\" Not allowed to start by looking for it, I suppose?","The sure mark of an unliterary man is that he considers \\"I\'ve read it already\\" to be a conclusive argument against reading a work...Those read great works,on the other hand will read the same work ten, twenty or thirty times during the course of there life.","If you want to get out of a house without being seen, the middle of the afternoon is in some ways a better time to try it than the middle of the night. Doors and windows are more likely to be open; and if you are caught, you can always pretend you weren\'t meaning to go far and had no particular plans. (It is very hard to make either giants or grown-ups believe this if you\'re found climbing out of a bedroom window at one o\'clock in the morning.)","But if suffering is good, ought it not to be pursued rather than avoided? I answer that suffering is not good in itself. What is good in any painful experience is, for the sufferer, his submission to the will of God, and, for the spectators, the compassion aroused and the acts of mercy to which it leads.","I think the best results are obtained by people who work quietly away at limited objectives, such as the abolition of the slave trade, or prison reform, or factory acts, or tuberculosis, not by those who think they can achieve universal justice, or health, or peace.","I look up at the night sky. Is anything more certain than that in all those vast times and spaces, if I were allowed to search them, I should nowhere find her face, her voice, her touch? She died. She is dead.

It does not move towards unity but away from it and the creatures grow further apart as they increase in perfection. Good, as it ripens, becomes continually more different not only from evil but from other good.","The next moment is as much beyond our grasp, and as much in God\u2019s care, as that a hundred years away.

If she can stand on her two feet and look him in the face it\u2019ll be the most she can do and more than I expect of her. No, no. He\u2019ll put all to rights, as it says in an old rhyme in these parts:Wrong will be right, when Aslan comes in sight,At the sound of his roar, sorrows will be no more,When he bares his teeth, winter meets its deathAnd when he shakes his mane, we shall have spring again.You\u2019ll understand when you see him.\u201d\u201cBut shall we see him?\u201d asked Susan.\u201cWhy, Daughter of Eve, that\u2019s what I brought you here for. I\u2019m to lead you where you shall meet him,\u201d said Mr. Beaver.\u201cIs--is he a man?\u201d asked Lucy.\u201cAslan a man!\u201d said Mr. Beaver sternly. \u201cCertainly not. I tell you he is the King of the wood and the son of the great Emperor-Beyond-the-Sea. Don\u2019t you know who is the King of Beasts?

As a result you are already too old for fairy tales, and by the time it is printed and bound you will be older still. But some day you will be old enough to start reading fairy tales again. You can then take it down from some upper shelf, dust it, and tell me what you think of it. I shall probably be too deaf to hear, and too old to understand a word you say, but I shall still be your affectionate Godfather, C.S.

Aslan the Great gave me this tail and no one, repeat, no one, touches the tail. Period, exclamation mark!","The two creatures were sexless. But he of Malacandra was masculine (not male); she of Perelandra was feminine (not female). Malacandra seemed to him to have the look of one standing armed, at the ramparts of his own remote archaic world, in ceaseless vigilance, his eyes ever roaming the earth-ward horizon whence his danger came long ago. \\"A sailor\'s look,\\" Ransom once said to me; \\"you know... eyes that are impregnated with distance.\\" But the eyes of Perelandra opened, as it were, inward, as if they were the curtained gateway to a world of waves and murmurings and wandering airs, of life that rocked in winds and splashed on mossy stones and descended as the dew and arose sunward in thin-spun delicacy of mist. On Mars the very forests are of stone; in Venus the lands swim. For now he thought of them no more as Malacandra and Perelandra. He called them by their Tellurian names. With deep wonder he thought to himself, \\"My eyes have seen Mars and Venus. I have seen Ares and Aphrodite.","Yet this is what Jesus did. He told people that their sins were forgiven, and never waited to consult all the other people whom their sins had undoubtedly injured. He unhesitatingly behaved as if He was the party chiefly concerned, the person chiefly offended in all offences. This makes sense only if He really was the God whose laws are broken and whose love is wounded in every sin.","The sins of the flesh are bad, but they are the least bad of all sins. All the worst pleasures are purely spiritual: the pleasure of putting other people in the wrong, of bossing and patronising and spoiling sport, and back-biting, the pleasures of power, of hatred.","The man who agrees with us that some question, little regarded by others, is of great importance can be our Friend. He need not agree with us about the answer.","After all, you must have a capacity to receive, or even omnipotence can\'t give.","Shasta\'s heart fainted at these words for he felt he had no strength left. And he writhed inside at what seemed the cruelty and unfairness of the demand. He had not yet learned that if you do one good deed your reward usually is to be set to do another and harder and better one.","We shall all admit that a man who knows no Greek himself cannot teach Greek to his form: but it is equally certain that a man whose mind was formed in a period of cynicism and disillusion, cannot teach hope or fortitude.","For however important chastity (or courage, or truthfulness, or any other virtue) may be, this process trains us in habits of the soul which are more important still. It cures our illusions about ourselves and teaches us to depend on God. We learn, on the one hand, that we cannot trust ourselves even in our best moments, and, on the other, that we need not despair even in our worst, for our failures are forgiven. The only fatal thing is to sit down content with anything less than perfection.","I get the idea,\' said Mark though with an inward reservation that his present instinctive desire to batter the Professor\'s face into jelly would take a good deal of destroying.","But there may be a period, while the wings are just beginning to grow, when it cannot do so: and at that stage lumps on the shoulders- no one could tell by looking at them that they are going to be wings...","It is part of the nature of a strong erotic passion\u2014as distinct from a transient fit of appetite\u2014that makes more towering promises than any other emotion. No doubt all our desires makes promises, but not so impressively. To be in love involves the almost irresistible conviction that one will go on being in love until one dies, and that possession of the beloved will confer, not merely frequent ecstasies, but settled, fruitful, deep-rooted, lifelong happiness. Hence all seems to be at stake. If we miss this chance we shall have lived in vain. At the very thought of such a doom we sink into fathomless depths of self-pity.Unfortunately these promises are found often to be quite untrue. Every experienced adult knows this to be so as regards all erotic passions (except the one he himself is feeling at the moment). We discount the world-without-end pretensions of our friends\u2019 amours easily enough. We know that such things sometimes last\u2014and sometimes don\u2019t. And when they do last, this is not because they promised at the outset to do so. When two people achieve lasting happiness, this is not solely because they are great lovers but because they are also\u2014I must put it crudely\u2014good people; controlled, loyal, fair-minded, mutually adaptable people.If we establish a \u201cright to (sexual) happiness which supersedes all the ordinary rules of behavior, we do so not because of what our passion shows itself to be in experience but because of what it professes to be while we are in the grip of it.\u201d","There are those that steal other people\'s children. But her motherhood was of a different kind. Those on whom it fell went back to their natural parents loving them more. Few men looked on her without becoming, in a certain fashion, her lovers. But it was the kind of love that made them not less true, but truer to their own wives.","In the end the number of things he thought of saying all at once nearly suffocated him and he became silent.","He would have been horribly compelled to feel this Earth not as the bottom of a universe but as a ball spinning, and rolling onwards, both at delirious speed, and not through emptiness but through some densely inhabited and intricately structured medium.","This shame has nothing to do with He or She. It\'s the being mortal - how shall I say it? ... insufficient.","But we must not be Pharisaical even to the Pharisees.","Every human love, at its height, has a tendency to claim for itself a divine authority. Its voice tends to sound as if it were the will of God Himself. It tells us not to count the cost, it demands of us a total commitment, it attempts to over-ride all other claims and insinuates that any action which is sincerely done \u201cfor love\u2019s sake is thereby lawful and even meritorious.\u201d","In civilised life domestic hatred usually expresses itself by saying things which would appear quite harmless on paper (the words are not offensive) but in such a voice, or at such a moment, that they are not far short of a blow in the face.","Nothing in you that has not died will ever be raised from the dead.","I said not long before that work and weakness are comforters. But sweat is the kindest creature of the three--far better than philosophy, as a cure for ill thoughts.","\xabDios susurra y habla a la conciencia a trav\xe9s del placer, pero le grita mediante el dolor: el dolor es su meg\xe1fono para despertar a un mundo adormecido\xbb C.S.

This is a very terrible experience. As long as what you are afraid of is something evil, you may still hope that the good may come to your rescue. But suppose you struggle through to the good and find that is also dreadful? How if food itself turns out to be the very thing you can\u2019t eat, and home the very place you can\u2019t live, and your very comforter the person who makes you uncomfortable? Then, indeed, there is no rescue possible: the last card has been played.\u201d","We are ready to turn and twist the facts until they bear no resemblance to the original thing.","Of all arguments against love, none makes so strong an appeal to my nature as \\"Careful! This might lead you to suffering.\\"To my nature, my temperament, yes. Not to my conscience. When I respond to that appeal I seem to myself to be a thousand miles away from Christ. If I am sure of anything I am sure that His teaching was never meant to confirm my congenital preference for safe investments and limited liabilities. I doubt whether there is anything in me that pleases Him less. And who could conceivably begin to love God on such a prudential ground-- because the security (so to speak) is better? Who could even include it among the grounds for loving?","We in this house are all that is left of Logres.","Of all tyrannies a tyranny sincerely exercised for the good of its victims may be the most oppressive. It may be better to live under robber barons than under omnipotent moral busybodies.","Most of us, I suppose, have a secret country but for most of us it is only an imaginary country.","But then of course I know perfectly well that He can\'t be used as a road. If you\'re approaching Him not as the goal but as a road, not as the end but as a means, you\'re not really approaching Him at all. That\'s what was really wrong with all those popular pictures of happy reunions \'on the further shore\'; not the simple-minded and very earthly images, but the fact that they make an End of what we can get only as a by-product of the true End. Lord, are these your real terms? Can I meet H. again only if I learn to love you so much that I don\'t care whether I meet her or not?","The whole point of seeing through something is to see something through it.","There have been times when I think we do not desire heaven, but more often I find myself wondering whether, in our heart of hearts, we have desired anything else.","The problem with trying to make yourself stupider than you really are is that you so very often succeed.","But suppose you struggle through to the good and find that it is also dreadful?","I call this a Divine Humility because it is a poor thing to strike our colors to God when the ship is going down under us; a poor thing to come to him as a last resort, to offer up \'our own\' when it is no longer worth keeping. If God were proud He would hardly have us on such terms: but He is not proud, He stoops to conquer, He will have us even though we have shown that we prefer everything else to him, and come to him because there is \'nothing better\' now to be had. The same humility is shown by all those Divine appeals to our fears which trouble high-minded readers of Scripture. It is hardly complimentary to God that we should choose Him as an alternative to Hell: yet even this He accepts. The creatures illusion to self-sufficiency must, for the creature\'s sake, be shattered; and by trouble or fear of trouble on earth, by crude fear of eternal flames, God shatters it \'unmindful of his glory\'s diminution\'. Those who would like the God of Scripture to be more purely ethical, do not know what they ask.","what was myth in one world might always be fact in some other.","A moderately bad man knows he is not very good; a thoroughly bad man thinks he is all right.","beneath the fragile and very human veneer of the organized churches of the world, there lies a truth so real and so pristine that all of man\u2019s concocted philosophical posings tumble into ruin beside it.","He had passed from Hegel into Hume, thence through Pragmatism, and thence through Logical Positivism, and out at last into the complete void.","It is not fatigue simply as such that produces the anger, but unexpected demands on a man already tired.","His name was Reepicheep and he was a gay and martial mouse.

I know. Grief is great. Only you and I in this land know that yet.","These two Kings and two Queens governed Narnia well, and long and happy was their reign. At first much of their time was spent in seeking out the remnants of the White Witch\'s army and destroying them, and indeed for a long time there would be news of evil things lurking in the wilder parts of the forest- a haunting here and a killing there, a glimpse of a werewolf one month and a rumor of a hag the next. But in the end all that foul brood was stamped out. And they made good laws and kept the peace and saved good trees from being unnecessarily cut down, and liberated young dwarfs and young satyrs from being sent to school, and generally stopped busybodies and interferers and encouraged ordinary people who wanted to live and let live. And they drove back the fierce giants (quite a different sort from Giant Rumblebuffin) in the North of Narnia when these ventured across the frontier. And they entered into friendship and alliance with countries beyond the sea and paid them visits of state and received visits of state from them. And they themselves grew and changed as the years passed over them. And Peter became a tall and deep-chested man and a great warrior, and he was called King Peter the Magnificent. And Susan grew into a tall and gracious woman with black hair that fell almost to her feet and the kings of the countries beyond the sea began to send ambassadors asking for her hand in marriage. And she was called Queen Susan the Gentle. Edmund was a graver and quieter man than Peter, and great in council and judgement. He was called King Edmund the Just. But as for Lucy, she was always gay and golden-haired, and all the princes in those parts desired her to be their Queen, and her own people called her Queen Lucy the Valiant.","We\'re in a world where everything, even a lamp-post, comes to life and grows. Now I wonder what kind of a seed a lamp-post grows from....","No, you\'re forgetting,\' said the Spirit. \'That was not how you began. Light itself was your first love: you loved paint only as a means of telling about light","There are only two kinds of people in the end: those who say to God, \u201cThy will be done, and those to whom God says, in the end, \u201cThy will be done.\u201d All that are in Hell, choose it. Without that self-choice there could be no Hell. No soul that seriously and constantly desires joy will ever miss it. Those who seek find. To those who knock it is opened.\u201d","If Affection is made the absolute sovereign of a human life the seeds will germinate. Love, having become a god, becomes a demon.","The vice I am talking of is Pride or Self-Conceit: and the virtue opposite to it, in Christian morals, is called Humility. You may remember, when I was talking about sexual morality, I warned you that the centre of Christian morals did not lie there. Well, now, we have come to the centre. According to Christian teachers, the essential vice, the utmost evil, is Pride. Unchastity, anger, greed, drunkenness, and all that, are mere fleabites in comparison: it was through Pride that the devil became the devil: Pride leads to every other vice: it is the complete anti-God state of mind. Does this seem to you exaggerated? If so, think it over. I pointed out a moment ago that the more pride one had, the more one disliked pride in others. In fact, if you want to find out how proud you are the easiest way is to ask yourself, \u2018How much do I dislike it when other people snub me, or refuse to take any notice of me, or shove their oar in, or patronise me, or show off?\u2019 The point is that each person\u2019s pride is in competition with every one else\u2019s pride. It is because I wanted to be the big noise at the party that I am so annoyed at someone else being the big noise. Two of a trade never agree. Now what you want to get clear is that Pride is essentially competitive\u2014is competitive by its very nature\u2014while the other vices are competitive only, so to speak, by accident. Pride gets no pleasure out of having something, only out of having more of it than the next man. We say that people are proud of being rich, or clever, or good-looking, but they are not. They are proud of being richer, or cleverer, or better-looking than others. If everyone else became equally rich, or clever, or good-looking there would be nothing to be proud about. It is the comparison that makes you proud: the pleasure of being above the rest. Once the element of competition has gone, pride has gone.","When we see the face of God we shall know that we have always known it. He has been a party to, has made, sustained and moved moment by moment within, all our earthly experiences of innocent love. All that was true love in them was, even on earth, far more His than ours, and ours only because His. In Heaven there will be no anguish and no duty of turning away from our earthly Beloveds. First, because we shall have turned already; from the portraits to the Original, from the rivulets to the Fountain, from the creatures He made lovable to Love Himself. But secondly, because we shall find them all in Him. By loving Him more than them we shall love them more than we now do.","In her also I found what I liked best\u2014an unfailing, kindly welcome without a hint of sentimentality, unruffled good sense, the unobtrusive talent for making all things at all times as cheerful and comfortable as circumstances allowed.","Infinite hopes\u2014and fears\u2014may both be yours.

But\u201d","Though I have forgotten the reason, there is spread over everything a vague sense of wrongness, of something amiss. Like in those dreams where nothing terrible occurs\u2014nothing that would sound even remarkable if you told it at breakfast-time\u2014but the atmosphere, the taste, the whole thing is deadly. So with this.","God looks at you as if you were a little Christ: Christ stands beside you to turn you into one.","And you cannot go on indefinitely being just an ordinary, decent egg. We must be hatched or go bad.","And after all, our mythology may be much nearer to literal truth than we suppose.","There is but one good; that is God.

I was afraid of his claws, I can tell you, but I was pretty nearly desperate now. So I just lay flat down on my back to let him do it.\\"The very first tear he made was so deep and I thought it had gone right into my heart. And when he began pulling the skin off, it hurt worse than anything I\'ve ever felt. The only thing that made me able to bear it was just the pleasure of feeling the stuff peel off. You know \u2013 if you\'ve ever picked the scab of a sore place. It hurts like billy-oh but it is such fun to see it coming away.","We want the Church to be small not only that fewer men may know the Enemy but also that those who do may acquire the uneasy intensity and the defensive self-righteousness of a secret society or a clique.","And there was I as smooth and soft as a peeled switch and smaller than I had been.

Perhaps can\u2019t.","Many reviews are useless because, while purporting to condemn the book, they only reveal the reviewer\'s dislike of the kind to which it belongs. Let bad tragedies be censured by those who love tragedy, and bad detective stories by those who love the detective story. Then we shall learn their real faults. Otherwise we shall find epics blamed for not being novels, farces for not being high comedies, novels by James for lacking the swift action of Smollett. Who wants to hear a particular claret abused by a fanatical teetotaller, or a particular woman by a confirmed misogynist?","It must be remembered that no art lives by nature, only by acts of voluntary attention on the part of human individuals. When these are not made it ceases to exist.","But I wonder whether people who ask God to interfere openly and directly in our world quite realise what it will be like when He does. When that happens, it is the end of the world. When the author walks on to the stage the play is over. God is going to invade, all right: but what is the good of saying you are on His side then, when you see the whole natural universe melting away like a dream and something else\u2014something it never entered your head to conceive\u2014comes crashing in; something so beautiful to some of us and so terrible to others that none of us will have any choice left? For this time it will be God without disguise; something so overwhelming that it will strike either irresistible love or irresistible horror into every creature. It will be too late then to choose your side. There is no use saying you choose to lie down when it has become impossible to stand up. That will not be the time for choosing: it will be the time when we discover which side we really have chosen, whether we realised it before or not. Now, today, this moment, is our chance to choose the right side. God is holding back to give us that chance. It will not last for ever. We must take it or leave it.","Attempts to connect men\'s circumstances too closely with their literary productions are usually, I believe, unsuccessful.","One of the most dangerous of literary ventures is the little, shy, unimportant heroine whom none of the other characters value. The danger is that your readers may agree with the other characters.","By praying really hard, you can make it so that your worst enemy feels dumb.","In reality the puritans and the humanists were quite often the same people.","I do not believe God created an egalitarian world. I believe the authority of parent over child, husband over wife, learned over simple, to have been as much a part of the original plan as the authority of man over beast.","God is the only comfort, He is also the supreme terror:","Of the things that followed I cannot at all say whether they were what men call real or what men call dream. And for all I can tell, the only difference is that what many see we call a real thing, and what only one sees we call a dream. But things that many see may have no taste or moment in them at all, and things that are shown only to one may be spears and water-spouts of truth from the very depth of truth.","I thought I could describe a state; make a map of sorrow. Sorrow, however, turns out to be not a state but a process. It needs not a map but a history, and if I don\u2019t stop writing that history at some quite arbitrary point, there\u2019s no reason why I should ever stop.","Los largos, aburridos y mon\xf3tonos a\xf1os de prosperidad en la edad madura o deadversidad en la misma edad son un excelente tiempo de combate.

Such longing is in itself the very reverse of wishful thinking: it is more like thoughtful wishing.","Yes,\\" said Peter, \\"I suppose what makes it feel so queer is that in the stories it\'s always someone in our world who does the calling. One doesn\'t really think about where the Jinn\'s coming from.\\" \\"And now we know what it feels like for the Jinn,\\" said Edmund with a chuckle. \\"Golly! It\'s a bit uncomfortable to know that we can be whistled for like that.

It is always shocking to meet life where we thought we were alone. \u2018Look out!\u2019 we cry, \u2018it\u2019s alive\u2019.

An \u2018impersonal God\u2019\u2014well and good. A subjective God of beauty, truth and goodness, inside our own heads\u2014better still.

But God Himself, alive, pulling at the other end of the cord, perhaps approaching at an infinite speed, the hunter, king, husband\u2014that is quite another matter. There comes a moment when the children who have been playing at burglars hush suddenly: was that a real footstep in the hall? There comes a moment when people who have been dabbling in religion (\u2018Man\u2019s search for God!\u2019) suddenly draw back. Supposing we really found Him? We never meant it to come to that! Worse still, supposing He had found us?","You invaded Narnia. You have no more right leading than Miraz does. Peter Pevensie: You, him, your father! Narnia\'s better off without the lot of you!","Emotional intensity is in itself no proof of spiritual depth. If we pray in terror we shall pray earnestly; it only proves that terror is an earnest emotion.

It is all thrills and no work:","No net less wide than a man\'s whole heart, nor less fine of mesh than love, will hold the sacred Fish.","My anger protected me only for a short time; anger wearies itself out and truth comes in.","Submit to death, death of your ambitions and favourite wishes every day and death of your whole body in the end: submit with every fibre of your being, and you will find eternal life.","We appear to be saying something very important aboutsomething: and actually we are only saying something about our own feelings.","There was certainly plenty to watch and listen to. The tree which Digory had noticed was now a full-grown beech whose branches swayed gently above his head. They stood on cool, green grass, sprinkled with daisies and buttercups. A little way off, along the river bank, willows were growing. On the other side tangles of flowering currant, lilac, wild rose, and rhododendron closed them in.","Our research department has not yet discovered (though success is hourly expected) how to produce any virtue.","I couldn\u2019t believe that nine-hundred and ninety-nine religions were completely false and the remaining one true.

Well, I\u2019m not. I\u2019m a Man. If I look like an Ape, that\u2019s because I\u2019m so very old: hundreds and hundreds of years old. And it\u2019s because I\u2019m so old that I\u2019m so wise. And it\u2019s because I\u2019m so wise that I\u2019m the only one Aslan is ever going to speak to. He can\u2019t be bothered talking to a lot of stupid animals. He\u2019ll tell me what you\u2019ve got to do, and I\u2019ll tell the rest of you. And take my advice, and see you do it in double quick time, for he doesn\u2019t mean to stand any nonsense.\u201dThere was dead silence except for the noise of a very young badger crying and its mother trying to make it keep quiet.\u201cAnd now here\u2019s another thing,\u201d the Ape went on, fitting a fresh nut into its cheek, \u201cI hear some of the horses are saying, Let\u2019s hurry up and get this job of carting timber over as quickly as we can, and then we\u2019ll be free again. Well, you can get that idea out of your heads at once. And not only the Horses either. Everybody who can work is going to be made to work in future. Aslan has it all settled with the King of Calormen\u2014The Tisroc, as our dark faced friends the Calormenes call him. All you Horses and Bulls and Donkeys are to be sent down into Calormen to work for your living\u2014pulling and carrying the way horses and such-like do in other countries.

Aslan would never sell us into slavery to the King of Calormen.\u201d\u201cNone of that! Hold your noise!\u201d said the Ape with a snarl. \u201cWho said anything about slavery? You won\u2019t be slaves. You\u2019ll be paid\u2014very good wages too. That is to say, your pay will be paid into Aslan\u2019s treasury and he will use it all for everybody\u2019s good.\u201d Then he glanced, and almost winked, at the chief Calormene. The Calormene bowed and replied, in the pompous Calormene way:\u201cMost sapient Mouthpiece of Aslan, The Tisroc (may-he-live-forever) is wholly of one mind with your lordship in this judicious plan.\u201d\u201cThere! You see!\u201d said the Ape. \u201cIt\u2019s all arranged. And all for your own good. We\u2019ll be able, with the money you earn, to make Narnia a country worth living in.

True freedom means doing what I tell you.\u201d\u201cH-n-n-h,\u201d grunted the Bear and scratched its head; it found this sort of thing hard to understand.\u201d","Come and help to carry the tray down and we\'ll have breakfast.

Have you felt that too? I always thought I was the only one. The book aims at telling the story of my conversion and is not a general autobiography, still less \u201cConfessions\u201d like those of St. Augustine or Rousseau. This means in practice that it gets less like a general autobiography as it goes on.\u201d","The relief was so great that Eustace almost laughed out loud. He began to feel as if he had fought and killed the dragon instead of merely seeing it die.","Human life has always been lived on the edge of precipice. Human culture has always had to exist under the shadow of something infinitely more important than itself. If men had postponed the search for knowledge and beauty until they were secure, the search would have never begun. We are mistaken when we compare war with \\"normal life.\\" Life has never been normal.","Be winged. Be the father of all flying horses,\\" roared Aslan in a voice that shook the ground. \\"Your name is Fledge.\\"The horse shied, just as it might have shied in the old, miserable days when it pulled a hansom. Then it roared. It strained its neck back as if there were a fly biting its shoulders and it wanted to scratch them. And then, just as the beasts had burst out of the earth, there burst out from the shoulders of Fledge wings that spread and grew, larger than eagles\', larger than swans\', larger than angels\' wings in church windows. The feathers shone chestnut color and copper color. He gave a great sweep with them and leapt into the air. Twenty feet above Aslan and Digory he snorted, neighed, and curvetted. Then, after circling once round them, he dropped to the earth, all four hoofs together, looking awkward and surprised, but extremely pleased.\\"Is it good, Fledge?\\" said Aslan.\\"It is very good, Aslan,\\" said Fledge.","I was sick with desire; that sickness better than health.","All times may be soon to Aslan; but in my home all hungry times are one o\'clock.","All reality is iconoclastic. The earthly beloved, even in this life, incessantly triumphs over your mere idea of her. And you want her to; you want her with all her resistances, all her faults, all her unexpectedness. That is, in her foursquare and independent reality. And this, not any image or memory, is what we are to love still, after she is dead.","It is not simply that God has arbitrarily made us such that He is our only good. Rather God is the only good of all creatures: and by necessity, each must find its good in that kind and degree of fruition of God which is proper to its nature. The kind and degree may vary with the creature\'s nature: but that there ever could be any other good, is an atheistic dream. George Macdonald, in a passage I cannot now find, represents God as saying to men, \'You must be strong with my strength and blessed with my blessedness, for I have no other to give you.\' That is the conclusion of the whole matter. God gives what He has, not what He has not: He gives the happiness that there is, not the happiness that is not. To be God - to be like God and to share His goodness in creaturely response - to be miserable - these are the only three alternatives. If we will not learn to eat the only food that the universe grows - that only food that any possible universe ever can grow - then we must starve eternally.","The low early sunshine was streaming through the wood and the grass was grey with dew and the cobwebs were like silver. Just beside them was a little, very dark-wooded tree, about the size of an apple tree. The leaves were whitish and rather papery, like the herb called honesty, and it was loaded with little brown fruits that looked rather like dates.","Well. You have a secret from me,\\" he said in the end. \\"No, don\'t turn away from me. Did you think I would try to press or conjure it out of you? Never that. Friends must be free.

When a man is getting worse he understands his own badness less and less. A moderately bad man knows he is not very good: a thoroughly bad man thinks he is all right.","I think we delight to praise what we enjoy becausethe joy is not complete until it is expressed. It isnot out of compliment that lovers keep on tellingone another how beautiful they are. The delight isincomplete until it is expressed.","The most important events in every age never reach the history books.","It may even be one of the greatest arts; for it produces works which give us (at the first meeting) as much delight and (on prolonged acquaintance) as much wisdom and strength as the works of the greatest poets. It is in some ways more akin to music than to poetry or at least to most poetry. It goes beyond the expression of things we have already felt. It arouses in us sensations we have never had before, never anticipated having, as though we had broken out of our normal mode of consciousness and \'possessed joys not promised to our birth.\' It gets under our skin, hits us at a level deeper than our thoughts or even our passions, troubles oldest certainties till all questions are re-opened, and in general shocks us more fully awake than we are for most of our lives.It was in this mythopoeic art that MacDonald excelled.","Faster and faster they raced, but no one got hot or tired or out of breath.","Now it may surprise you to learn that in His efforts to get permanent possession of a soul, He relies on the troughs even more than on the peaks; some of His special favourites have gone through longer and deeper throughs than anyone else.","And just as the Witch Jadis had looked different when you saw her in our world instead of in her own, so the fruit of that mountain garden looked different too. There were of course all sorts of colored things in the bedroom; the colored counterpane on the bed, the wallpaper, the sunlight from the window, and Mother\'s pretty, pale blue dressing jacket. But the moment Digory took the Apple out of his pocket, all those things seemed to have scarcely any color at all. Everyone of them, even the sunlight, looked faded and dingy. The brightness of the Apple threw strange lights on the ceiling. Nothing else was worth looking at: you couldn\'t look at anything else. And the smell of the Apple of Youth was as if there was a window in the room that opened on Heaven.","And grief still feels like fear. Perhaps, more importantly, like suspense. Or like waiting; just hanging about waiting for something to happen.","I don\'t believe your theory that \\"readers never notice that sort of thing.\\" I\'m sure I should.","The task of the modern educator is not to cut down jungles but to irrigate deserts. The right defense against false sentiments is to inculcate just sentiments. By starving the sensibility of our pupils we only make them easier prey to the propagandist when he comes. For famished nature will be avenged and a hard heart is no infallible protection against a soft head.","I need Christ, not something that resembles Him. I want H., not something that is like her. A really good photograph might become in the end a snare, a horror, and an obstacle.","Thus up from the garden to the Gardener, from the sword to the Smith. To the life-giving Life and the Beauty that makes beautiful.","Satan and his devils want a whole race perpetually in pursuit of the rainbow\'s end, never honest, nor kind, nor happy now, but always using as mere fuel wherewith to heap the altar of the Future every real gift which is offered them in the Present.","La tarea del educador moderno no es podar las selvas, sino regar los desiertos.","we must remember that the soul is but a hollow which God fills.","The Enemy\'s human partisans have all been plainly told by Him that suffering is an essential part of what He calls Redemption; so that a faith which is destroyed by a war or a pestilence cannot really have been worth the trouble of destroying.","We may be content to remain what we call \'ordinary people\': but He is determined to carry out a quite different plan. To shrink back from that plan is not humility; it is laziness and cowardice. To submit to it is not conceit or megalomania; it is obedience.","when pain is to be borne, a little courage helps more than much knowledge, a little human sympathy more than much courage, and the least tincture of the love of God more than all.","Then he buttoned up his coat, took a deep breath, and picked up the ring. And he thought then, as he always thought afterward too, that he could not decently have done anything else.","Do what you will, there is going to be some benevolence, as well as some malice, in your patient\'s soul. The great thing is to direct the malice to his immediate neighbours whom he meets every day and to thrust his benevolence out to the remote circumference, to people he does not know. The malice thus becomes wholly real and the benevolence largely imaginary.","the fatal false step which, once taken, would thrust her down into the terrible slavery of appetite and hate and economics and government which our race knows so well.","ignorant child who wants to go on making mud pies in a slum because he cannot imagine what is meant by the offer of a holiday at the sea. We are far too easily pleased.","Meantime, however we want to know not how we should pray if we were perfect, but how we should pray being as we now are... It is of no use to ask God with a fastidious earnestness for A when our whole mind is in reality filled with the desire for B. We must lay before him what is in us, not what ought to be in us.","After all, real things are not simple.","Swords can be kept off with shields but the Eye of Wisdom pierces through every defense.","That hierarchical inequality, the need for self surrender, the willing sacrifice of self to others, hold sway in the realm beyond Nature. It is indeed only love that makes the difference: all those very same principles which are evil in the world of selfishness and necessity are good in the world of love and understanding.","If we thought we were building up a heaven on earth, if we looked for something that would turn the present world from a place of pilgrimage into a permanent city satisfying the soul of man, we are disillusioned, and not a moment too soon. But if we thought that for some souls, and at some times, the life of learning, humbly offered to God, was, in its own small way, one of the appointed approaches to the Divine reality and the Divine beauty which we hope to enjoy hereafter, we can think so still.","When a word ceases to be a term of description and becomes merely a term of praise, it no longer tells you about the object: it only tells you about the speakers attitude to that object.","One of the purposes for which God instituted prayer may have been to bear witness that the course of events is not governed like a state but created like a work of art to which every being makes a conscious contribution, and in which every being is both a means and an end.","Safe? Who said anything about safe? \u2018Course he isn\u2019t safe. But he\u2019s good.","If all the world were Christian, it might not matter if all the world were uneducated. But, as it is, a cultural life will exist outside the Church whether it exists inside or not. To be ignorant and simple now -- not to be able to meet the enemies on their own ground -- would be to throw down our weapons, and to betray our uneducated brethren who have, under God, no defense but us against the intellectual attacks of the heathen. Good philosophy must exist, if for no other reason, because bad philosophy needs to be answered. The cool intellect must work not only against cool intellect on the other side, but against the muddy heathen mysticisms which deny intellect altogether. Most of all, perhaps we need intimate knowledge of the past. Not that the past has any magic about it, but because we cannot study the future, and yet need something to set against the present, to remind us that periods and that much which seems certain to the uneducated is merely temporary fashion. A man who has lived in many place is not likely to be deceived by the local errors of his native village: the scholar has lived in many times and is therefore in some degree immune form the great cataract of nonsense that pours from the press and the microphone of his own age.","But the educated public, the people who read the highbrow weeklies, don\u2019t need reconditioning. They\u2019re all right already. They\u2019ll believe anything.","And the lesson of it all is, your Highness, said the oldest Dwarf, \u201cthat those Northern Witches always mean the same thing, but in every age they have a different plan for getting it.\u201d","She was nearly fainting: indeed, she wished she could really faint, but faints don\'t come for the asking.","We are not living in a world where all roads are radii of a circle and where all, if followed long enough, will therefore draw gradually nearer and finally meet at the centre: rather in a world where every road, after a few miles,forks into two, and each of those into two again, and at each fork you must make a decision. Even on the biological level life is not like a river but like a tree. It does not move towards unity but away from it and the creatures grow further apart as they increase in perfection. Good, as it ripens, becomes continually more different not only from evil but from other good.","Jaweh is clearly not a Nature-God. He does not die and come to life each year as a true Corn-king should. He may give wine and fertility, but must not be worshipped with Bacchanalian or aphrodisiac rites.","There is no good trying to be more spiritual than God. God never meant man to be a purely spiritual creature. That is why He uses material things like bread and wine to put the new life into us. We may think this rather crude and unspiritual. God does not: He invented eating. He likes matter. He invented it.","Eros, honoured without reservation and obeyed unconditionally, becomes a demon.","Prayer is either a sheer illusion or a personal contact between embryonic, incomplete persons (ourselves) and the utterly concrete Person. Prayer in the sense of petition, asking for things, is a small part of it; confession and penitence are its threshold, adoration its sanctuary, the presence and vision and enjoyment of God its bread and wine. In it God shows Himself to us. That He answers prayers is a corollary\u2014not necessarily the most important one\u2014from that revelation. What He does is learned from what He is.","We do not truly see light, we only see slower things lit by it.","I would make it a rule to eradicate from my patient any strong personal taste which is not actually a sin, even if it is something quite trivial such as a fondness for county cricket or collecting stamps or drinking cocoa. Such things, I grant you, have nothing of virtue in them; but there is a sort of innocence and humility and self-forgetfulness about them which I distrust. The man who truly and disinterestedly enjoys any one thing in the world, for its own sake, and without caring twopence what other people say about it, is by that very fact fore-armed against some of our subtlest modes of attack. You should always try to make the patient abandon the people or food or books he really likes in favour of the \u201cbest people, the \u201cright\u201d food, the \u201cimportant\u201d books.\u201d","And not wretched sausages half full of bread and soya bean either, but real meaty, spicy ones, fat and piping hot and burst and just the tiniest bit burnt.

The sure mark of an unliterary man is that he considers \u2018I\u2019ve read it already\u2019 to be a conclusive argument against reading a work. We have all known women who remembered a novel so dimly that they had to stand for half an hour in the library skimming through it before they were certain they had once read it. But the moment they became certain, they rejected it immediately. It was for them dead, like a burnt-out match, an old railway ticket, or yesterday\u2019s paper; they had already used it. Those who read great works, on the other hand, will read the same work ten, twenty or thirty times during the course of their life.","Well done.\'Digory\'s hunger and temptation didn\'t cause him to stray, and it was worth it just for that \\"well done\\" from Aslan.","I have come home at last! This is my real country! I belong here. This is the land I have been looking for all my life, though I never knew it till now. The reason why we loved the old Narnia is that it sometimes looked a little like this.","I pay respect to wisdom not to strength.","It may be better to live under robber barons than omnipotent moral busybodies.","I do wish Slumtrimpet could do something about undermining that young woman\'s sense of the ridiculous.","The war creates no absolutely new situation: it simply aggravates the permanent human situation so that we can no longer ignore it. Human life has always been lived on the edge of a precipice. Human culture has always had to exist under the shadow of something infinitely more important than itself. If men had postponed the search for knowledge and beauty until they were secure, the search would never have begun.","A man is not usually called upon to have an opinion of his own talents at all, since he can very well go on improving them to the best of his ability without deciding on his own precise niche in the temple of Fame... [Man] did not create themselves... their talents were given them, and they might as well be proud of the colour of their hair.","When He died in the Wounded World He died not for men, but for each man. If each man had been the only man made, He would have done no less.","Love... is a deep unity maintained by the will and deliberately strengthened by habit; reinforced by (in Christian marriages) the grace which both parents ask, and receive, from God.","The more he fears, the more he\'ll hate.","A man who was merely a man and said the sort of things Jesus said would not be a great moral teacher. He would either be a lunatic\u2014on a level with the man who says he is a poached egg\u2014or else he would be the Devil of Hell. You must make your choice. Either this man was, and is, the Son of God: or else a madman or something worse. You can shut Him up for a fool, you can spit at Him and kill Him as a demon; or you can fall at His feet and call Him Lord and God. But let us not come with any patronising nonsense about His being a great human teacher. He has not left that open to us. He did not intend to.","Pain provides an opportunity for heroism; the opportunity is seized with surprising frequency.","We have a strange illusion that mere time cancels sin. I have heard others, and I have heard myself, recounting cruelties and falsehoods committed in boyhood as if they were no concern of the present speaker\u2019s, and even with laughter. But mere time does nothing either to the fact or to the guilt of a sin. The guilt is washed out not by time but by repentance and the blood of Christ: if we have repented these early sins we should remember the price of our forgiveness and be humble. As","You will not find the warrior, the poet, the philosopher, or the Christian by staring in his eyes as if he were your mistress: better fight beside him, read with him, argue with him, pray with him.","All our merely natural activities will be accepted, if they are offered to God, even the humblest, and all of them, even the noblest, will be sinful if they are not.","It is, no doubt, impossible to prevent his praying for his mother, but we have means of rendering the prayers innocuous. Make sure they are always very \'spiritual\', that he is always concerned with the state of her soul and never with her rheumatism.","The fantastic suggestion that he, Curry, might be a bore passed through his mind so swiftly that a second later he had forgotten it forever.","Everything becomes more and more itself. Here is joy that cannot be shaken. Our light can swallow up your darkness: but your darkness cannot now infect our light. No, no, no. Come to us. We will not go to you. Can you really have thought that love and joy would always be at the mercy of frowns and sighs? Did you not know they were stronger than their opposites?","The Enemy takes this risk because He has a curious fantasy of making all these disgusting little human vermin into what He calls His \u2018free\u2019 lovers and servants\u2014\u2019sons\u2019 is the word He uses, with His inveterate love of degrading the whole spiritual world by unnatural liaisons with the two-legged animals. Desiring their freedom, He therefore refuses to carry them, by their mere affections and habits, to any of the goals which He sets before them: He leaves them to \u2018do it on their own\u2019. And there lies our opportunity. But also, remember there lies our danger. If once they get through this initial dryness successfully, they become much less dependent on emotion and therefore much harder to tempt.","Great Scott! said Peter. \u201cSo it was the horn--your own horn, Su--that dragged us all off that seat on the platform yesterday morning! I can hardly believe it; yet it all fits in.\u201d\u201cI don\u2019t know why you shouldn\u2019t believe it,\u201d said Lucy, \u201cif you believe in magic at all. Aren\u2019t there lots of stories about magic forcing people out of one place--out of one world--into another? I mean, when a magician in The Arabian Nights calls up a Jinn, it has to come. We had to come, just like that.\u201d\u201cYes,\u201d said Peter, \u201cI suppose what makes it feel so queer is that in the stories it\u2019s always someone in our world who does the calling. One doesn\u2019t really think about where the Jinn\u2019s coming from.\u201d\u201cAnd now we know what it feels like for the Jinn,\u201d said Edmund with a chuckle. \u201cGolly! It\u2019s a bit uncomfortable to know that we can be whistled for like that. It\u2019s worse than what Father says about living at the mercy of the telephone.\u201d","If you\u2019ve been up all night and cried until you have no more tears left in you \u2013 you will know that there comes in the end a sort of quietness. You feel as if nothing was ever going to happen again.","Each generation exercises power over its successors: and each, in so far as it modifies the environment bequeathed to it and rebels against tradition, resists and limits the power of its predecessors. This modifies the picture which is sometimes painted of a progressive emancipation from tradition and a progressive control of natural processes resulting in a continual increase of human power. In reality, of course, if any one age really attains, by eugenics and scientific education, the power to make its descendants what it pleases, all men who live after it are the patients of that power. They are weaker, not stronger: for though we may have put wonderful machines in their hands we have pre-ordained how they are to use them.","Those who call for Nonsense will find that it comes.","Medicine labours to restore \'natural\' structure or \'normal\' function. But greed, egoism, self-deception,and self-pity are not abnormal in the same sense as astigmatism or a floating kidney. For who, in Heaven\'s name, would describe as natural or normal any man from whom these failings were wholly absent? \'Natural,\' if you like, in a quite different sense; archnatural, unfallen. We have only seen one such Man. And he was not at all like the psychologist\'s picture of the integrated, balanced, adjusted, happily married, employed, popular citizen. You can\'t really be \'well adjusted\' to your world if it says \'you havea devil\' and ends by nailing you up naked to a stake of wood.","The scalpel is better for operations, but it is no good for anything else. Poetry confines itself more and more to what only poetry can do; but this turns out to be something which not many people want done. Nor, of course, could they receive it if they did. Modern poetry is too difficult for them. It is idle to complain; poetry so pure as this must be difficult. But neither must the poets complain if they are unread. When the art of reading poetry requires talents hardly less exalted than the art of writing it, readers cannot be much more numerous than poets. If you write a piece for the fiddle that only one performer in a hundred can play you must not expect to hear it very often performed. The musical analogy is no longer a remote one.","In a sense, [Christianity] creates, rather than solves, the problem of pain, for pain would be no problem unless, side by side with our daily experience of this painful world, we had received what we think a good assurance that ultimate reality is righteous and loving.","These conversations between the Spirits and the Ghosts--were they only the mimicry of choices that had really been made long ago? Or might yet not as well say, anticipations of a choice to be made at the end of all things? But ye\'d do better to say neither. Ye saw the choices a bit more clearly than ye could see them on earth: the lens was clearer. But it was still seen through the lens. Do not ask of a vision in a dream more than a vision in a dream can give.","And no one ever told me about the laziness of grief. Except at my job\u2014where the machine seems to run on much as usual\u2014I loathe the slightest effort.","O my mistress, do not by any means destroy yourself, for if you live you may yet have good fortune but all the dead are dead alike!","You first taught me the great principle \\"Begin where you are.\\" I had thought one had to start by summoning up what we believe about the goodness and greatness of God, by thinking about creation and redemption and \\"all the blessings of this life.\\" You turned to the brook and once more splashed your burning face and hands in the little waterfall and said, \\"Why not begin with this?\\" And it worked. Apparently you have never guessed how much. That cushiony moss, that coldness and sound and dancing light were no doubt the very minor blessings compared with \\"the means of grace and the hope of glory.\\" But then they were manifest. So far as they were concerned, sight had replaced faith. They were not the hope of glory, they were an exposition of the glory itself.\\" Yet you were not - or so it seemed - telling me that \\"Nature,\\" or \\"the beauties of Nature,\\" manifest the glory. No such abstraction as \\"Nature\\" comes into it. I was learning the far more secret doctrine that pleasures are shafts of the glory as it strikes our sensibility. As it impinges on our will or understanding, we give it different names - goodness or truth or the like. But its flash upon our senses and mood is pleasure.","often pointed out that bright mornings brought on wet afternoons, and that you can\'t expect good times to last.","In the name of the Father and of the Son and of the Holy Ghost, here goes\u2014I mean Amen,\' said Ransom, and hurled the stone as hard as he could into the Un-man\'s face.","Ever since I served as an infantryman in the First World War I had a great dislike of people who themselves in ease and safety, issue exhortations to men in the front line.","My father, whom I implicitly believed, represented adult life as one of incessant drudgery under the continual threat of financial ruin.","We have lost the invaluable faculty of being shocked\u2014a faculty which has hitherto almost distinguished the Man or Woman from the beast or the child.","To prefer my own happiness to my neighbour\u2019s was like thinking that the nearest telegraph post was really the largest.","Because she is in God\'s hands.\' But if so, she was in God\'s hands all the time, and I have seen what they did to her here. Do they suddenly become gentler to us the moment we are out of the body and if so, why? If God\'s goodness is inconsistent with hurting us, then either God is not good or there is no God: for the only life we know He hurts us beyond our worst fears and beyond all we can imagine. If it is consistent with hurting us, then He may hurt us after death is unendurably as before it.","In our world, said Eustace, \u201ca star is a huge ball of flaming gas.\u201d \u201cEven in your world, my son, that is not what a star is but only what it is made of.\u201d","there was an inquiry into the whole thing. And in the inquiry all sorts of things about Experiment House came out, and about ten people got expelled. After that, the Head\u2019s friends saw that the Head was no use as a Head, so they got her made an Inspector to interfere with other Heads. And when they found she wasn\u2019t much good even at that, they got her into Parliament where she lived happily ever after.","we are mirrors whose brightness, if we are bright, is wholly derived from the sun that shines upon us.","There I drank life because death was in the pool.

I think earth, if chosen instead of Heaven, will turn out to have been, all along, only a region in Hell: and earth, if put second to Heaven, to have been from the beginning a part of Heaven itself.","We should never ask of anything \u201cIs it real?, for everything is real.

Because what she wants is smaller and less costly than what has been set before her, she never recognises as gluttony her determination to get what she wants, however troublesome it may be to others.","Tu no eres un cuerpo. Tu tienes un cuerpo. Tu eres un alma.","I have heard some people complain that if Jesus was God as well as man, then His suffering and death lose all value in their eyes, \'because it must have been so easy for him.\' Others may (very rightly) rebuke the ingratitude and ungraciousness of this objection; what staggers me is the misunderstanding it betrays. In one sense, of course, those who make it are right. They have even understated their own case. The perfect submission, the perfect suffering, the perfect death were not only easier to Jesus because he was God, but were possible only because He was God. But surely that is a very odd reason for not accepting them? The teacher is able to form the letters for the child because the teacher is grown-up and knows how to write. That, of course, makes it easier for the teacher; and only because \'it\'s easy for grown ups\' and waited to learn writing from another child who could not write itself (and so had no \'unfair\' advantage), it would not get on very quickly. If I am drowning in a rapid river, a man who still has one foot on the bank may give me a hand which saves my life. Ought I to shout back (between my gasps) \'No, it\'s not fair! You have an advantage! You\'re keeping one foot on the bank? That advantage--call it \'unfair\' if you like--is the only reason why he can be of any use to me. To what will you look for help if you will not look to that which is stronger than yourself?","His hands had been reddened, as all men\'s hands have been, in the slaying before the foundation of the world; now, if he chose, he would dip them again in the same blood. \'Mercy,\' he groaned...","and hear depends a good deal on where you are standing: it also depends on what sort of person you are.","The tortures occur, if they are unnecessary, then there is no God, or a bad one. If there is a good God, then these tortures are necessary for no even moderately good Being could possibly inflict or permit them if they weren\'t.","If you take nature as a teacher she will teach you exactly the lessons you had already decided to learn; this is only another way of saying that nature does not teach.","Isn\'t it funny how day by day nothing changes but when you look back, everything is different?","If you\'re approaching Him not as the goal but as a road, not as the end but as a means, you\'re not really approaching Him at all.","Such, then, was my position: to care for almost nothing but the gods and heroes, the garden of the Hesperides, Launcelot and the Grail, and to believe in nothing but atoms and evolution and military service.","He has impressed upon our natures or states\u2014must be an imitation of God incarnate: our model is the Jesus, not only of Calvary, but of the workshop, the roads, the crowds, the clamorous demands and surly oppositions, the lack of all peace and privacy, the interruptions. For this, so strangely unlike anything we can attribute to the Divine life in itself, is apparently not only like, but is, the Divine life operating under human conditions.","And don\'t mention it to anyone else unless you find that they\'ve had adventures of the same sort themselves. What\'s that? How will you know? Oh, you\'ll know all right. Odd things they say -- even their looks -- will let the secret out.","Justice shall be mixed with mercy. You shall not always be an Ass.","The will of Christ no longer limits theirs; it is theirs. All their time, in belonging to Him, belongs also to them, for they are His.","A great many of those who \u2018debunk\u2019 traditional or (as they would say) \u2018sentimental\u2019 values have in the background values of their own which they believe to be immune from the debunking process.

Our opinions were not honestly come by. We simply found ourselves in contact with a certain current of ideas and plunged into it because it seemed modern and successful. At College, you know, we just started automatically writing the kind of essays that got good marks and saying the kind of things that won applause. When, in our whole lives, did we honestly face, in solitude, the one question on which all turned: whether after all the Supernatural might not in fact occur? When did we put up one moment\u2019s real resistance to the loss of our faith?","Isn\u2019t it funny how day by day nothing changes, but when we look back everything is different.","What may be myth in one world may always be fact in some other.","As someone has said \\"gods\\" is not really the plural of God; God has no plural.","How ones range of interests grows!

Like sickness, it threatens pain and death. Like poverty, it threatens ill lodging, cold, heat, thirst, and hunger. Like slavery, it threatens toil, humiliation, injustice, and arbitrary rule. Like exile, it separates you from all you love. Like the gallies, it imprisons you at close quarters with uncongenial companions. It threatens every temporal evil\u2014every evil except dishonour and final perdition, and those who bear it like it no better than you would like it.","At bottom, he still believes he has run up a very favourable credit-balance in the Enemy\u2019s ledger by allowing himself to be converted,","Praise is the mode of love which always has some element of joy in it.

He wrote no book. We have only reported sayings, most of them uttered in answer to questions, shaped in some degree by their context. And when we have collected them all we cannot reduce them to a system. He preaches but He does not lecture. He uses paradox, proverb, exaggeration, parable, irony; even (I mean no irreverence) the \'wisecrack\'. He utters maxims which, like popular proverbs, if rigorously taken, may seem to contradict one another. His teaching therefore cannot be grasped by the intellect alone, cannot be \'got up\' as if it were a \'subject\'. If we try to do that with it, we shall find Him the most elusive of teachers. He hardly ever gave a straight answer to a straight question. He will not be, in the way we want, \'pinned down\'. The attempt is (again, I mean no irreverence) like trying to bottle a sunbeam.","for everything now felt as if it had been fated or had happened before.","If that (to travel hopefully is better to arrive) were true, and known to be true, how could anyone travel hopefully?

Everyone must sometimes have wondered why in nearly all tongues certain inanimate objects are masculine and others feminine. What is masculine about a mountain or feminine about certain trees? Ransom has cured me of believing that this is a purely morphological phenomenon, depending on the form of the word. Still less is gender an imaginative extension of sex. Our ancestors did not make mountains masculine because they projected male characteristics into them. The real process is the reverse. Gender is a reality, and a more fundamental reality than sex. Sex is, in fact, merely the adaptation to organic life of a fundamental polarity which divides all created beings. Female sex is simply one of the things that have feminine gender; there are many others, and Masculine and Feminine meet us on planes of reality where male and female would be simply meaningless. Masculine is not attenuated male, nor feminine attenuated female. On the contrary the male and female of organic creatures are rather faint and blurred reflections of masculine and feminine. Their reproductive functions, their differences in strength and size, partly exhibit, but partly also confuse and misrepresent, the real polarity. All this Ransom saw, as it were, with his own eyes. The two white creatures were sexless. But he of Malacandra was masculine (not male); she of Perelandra was feminine (not female).","Whatever we do, don\'t let\'s have any running.

There are only two errors which would be fatal to one placed in the peculiar situation which certain parts of your previous conduct have unfortunately created for you.

On the other, the slightest approach to unauthorized action\u2014anything which suggested that you were assuming a liberty of decision which, in all the circumstances, is not really yours\u2014might have consequences from which even I could not protect you. But as long as you keep quite clear of these two extremes, there is no reason (speaking unofficially) why you should not be perfectly safe.\u201d","And as he spoke, like the flush creeping along the underside of a cloud at sunrise, the colour came back to her white face and get eyes grew bright and she sat up and said, \'Why, I do declare I feel that better.

To say the patient is getting over it after an operation for appendicitis is one thing; after he\'s had his leg off it is quite another. After that operation either the wounded stump heals or the man dies. If it heals, the fierce, continuous pain will stop. Presently he\'ll get back his strength and be able to stump about on his wooden leg. He has \'got over it.\' But he will probably have recurrent pains in the stump all his life, and perhaps pretty bad ones; and he will always be a one-legged man. There will be hardly any moment when he forgets it. Bathing, dressing, sitting down and getting up again, even lying in bed, will all be different. His whole way of life will be changed. All sorts of pleasures and activities that he once took for granted will have to be simply written off. Duties too. At present I am learning to get about on crutches. Perhaps I shall presently be given a wooden leg. But I shall never be a biped again.","I enjoy writing fiction more than writing anything else.

If, on the other hand, he is aware that horrors may be in store for him and is praying for the virtues, wherewith to meet them, and meanwhile concerning himself with the Present because there, and there alone, all duty, all grace, all knowledge, and all pleasure dwell, his state is very undesirable and should be attacked at once.","My Dear Lucy, I wrote this story for you, but when I began it I had not realized that girls grow quicker than books.

But God wills our good and our good is to love Him (with that responsive love proper to creatives) and to love Hi we must know Him: and if we know Him, we shall in fact fall on our faces. If we do not, that only shows that what we are trying to love is nearest approximation to God which our thought and fantasy can attain. Yet the call is not only to prostration and awe; it is to a reflection of the Divine live, a creaturely participation in the Divine attributes which is far beyond our present desires. We are bidden to put on Christ, to become like God. That is, whether we like it or not, God intends to give us what we need not what we now think we want.

[is] produce[d by the devil and his angels]. This they do bu working through the small circle of artists, dressmakers, actresses, and advertisers who determine the fashionable type. The aim is to guide each sex away from those members of the other with whom spiritually helpful, happy, and fertile marriages are most likely. Thus [they] have now for many centuries triumphed over nature to the extent of making certain secondary characteristics of the male (such as the beard) disagreeable to nearly all the females-and there is more in that than you might suppose. As regards the male taste [they] have varied a good deal. At one time [they] have directed it to the statuesque and aristocratic type of beauty, mixing men\'s vanity with their desires and encouraging the race to breed chiefly from the most arrogant and prodigal women. At another, [they] have selected an exaggeratedly feminine type, faint and languishing, so that folly and cowardice, and all the general falseness and littleness of mind which go with them, shall be at a premium. At present [they] are on the opposite tack. The age of jazz has succeeded the age of the waltz, and [they] now teach men to like women whose bodies are scarcely distinguishable from those of boys. Since this is a kind of beauty even more transitory than most, [they] thus aggravate the female\'s chronic horror of growing old (with many [successful] results) and render her less willing and less able to bear children. And that is not all. [They] have engineered a great increase in the license which society allows to the representation of the apparent nude (not the real nude) in art, and its exhibition on the stage or the bathing beach. It is all a fake, or course; the figures in the popular art are falsely drawn; the real women in bathing suits or tights are actually pinched in and propped up to make them to appear firmer and more slender and more boyish than nature allows a full-grown woman to be. Yet at the same time, the modern world is taught to believe that it is being \\"frank\\" and \\"healthy\\" and getting back to nature. As a result [they] are more and more directing the desires of men to something which does not exist-making the role of the eye in sexuality more and more important and at the same time making its demands more and more impossible.","Hours later there came a change. It began to grow light in the bus. The greyness outside thewindows turned from mud-colour to mother of pearl, then to faintest blue, then to a bright blueness that stung the eyes.

But length of days with an evil heart is only length of misery and already she begins to know it. All get what they want; they do not always like it.","Yet perhaps even this view falls short of the truth. It is not simply that God has arbitrarily made us such that He is our only good. Rather, God is the only good of all creatures: and by necessity each must find its good in that kind and degree of the fruition of God which is proper to its nature. The kind and degree may vary with the creature\'s nature: but that there ever could be any other good is an atheistic dream. ... George Macdonald... represents God as saying to men, \'You must be strong with my strength and blessed with my blessedness for I have no other to give you.\' That is the whole conclusion of the matter. God gives what He has, not what He has not: He gives the happiness that there is, not the happiness that is not. To be God - to be like God and to share His goodness in creaturely response - to be miserable - these are the only three alternatives. If we will not learn to eat the only food that the universe grows - the only food that any possible universe can ever grow - then we must starve eternally.","Plato before him had said the same. The little human animal will not at first have the right responses. It must be trained to feel pleasure, liking, disgust, and hatred at those things which really are pleasant, likeable, disgusting and hateful.14 In the Republic, the well-nurtured youth is one \u2018who would see most clearly whatever was amiss in ill-made works of man or ill-grown works of nature, and with a just distaste would blame and hate the ugly even from his earliest years and would give delighted praise to beauty, receiving it into his soul and being nourished by it, so that he becomes a man of gentle heart. All this before he is of an age to reason; so that when Reason at length comes to him, then, bred as he has been, he will hold out his hands in welcome and recognize her because of the affinity he bears to her.","The great thing, if one can, is to stop regarding all the unpleasant things as interruptions of one\'s \'own\' or one\'s \'real\' life. The truth is of course that what one calls interruptions are precisely one\'s real life - the life God is sending one day by day; what one calls one\'s real life is a phantom of one\'s imagination.","I have great hopes that we shall learn in due time how to emotionalise and mythologise their science to such an extent that what is, in effect, a belief in us (though not under that name) will creep in while the human mind remains closed to belief in the Enemy. The","Consider for a few moments the enormous aesthetic claim of its chief contemporary rival\u2014what we may loosely call the Scientific Outlook, 1 the picture of Mr. [H. G.] Wells and the rest. Supposing this to be a myth, is it not one of the finest myths which human imagination has yet produced? The play is preceded by the most austere of all preludes: the infinite void, and matter restlessly moving to bring forth it knows not what. Then, by the millionth millionth chance\u2014what tragic irony\u2014the conditions at one point of space and time bubble up into that tiny fermentation which is the beginning of life. Everything seems to be against the infant hero of our drama\u2014just as everything seems against the youngest son or ill-used stepdaughter at the opening of a fairy tale. But life somehow wins through. With infinite suffering, against all but insuperable obstacles, it spreads, it breeds, it complicates itself, from the amoeba up to the plant, up to the reptile, up to the mammal. We glance briefly at the age of monsters. Dragons prowl the earth, devour one another, and die. Then comes the theme of the younger son and the ugly duckling once more. As the weak, tiny spark of life began amidst the huge hostilities of the inanimate, so now again, amidst the beasts that are far larger and stronger than he, there comes forth a little naked, shivering, cowering creature, shuffling, not yet erect, promising nothing, the product of another millionth millionth chance. Yet somehow he thrives. He becomes the Cave Man with his club and his flints, muttering and growling over his enemies\u2019 bones, dragging his screaming mate by her hair (I never could quite make out why), tearing his children to pieces in fierce jealousy till one of them is old enough to tear him, cowering before the horrible gods whom he created in his own image. But these are only growing pains. Wait till the next act. There he is becoming true Man. He learns to master Nature. Science comes and dissipates the superstitions of his infancy. More and more he becomes the controller of his own fate. Passing hastily over the present (for it is a mere nothing by the time scale we are using), you follow him on into the future. See him in the last act, though not the last scene, of this great mystery. A race of demigods now rules the planet\u2014and perhaps more than the planet\u2014for eugenics have made certain that only demigods will be born, and psychoanalysis that none of them shall lose or smirch his divinity, and communism that all which divinity requires shall be ready to their hands. Man has ascended his throne. Henceforward he has nothing to do but to practise virtue, to grow in wisdom, to be happy. And now, mark the final stroke of genius. If the myth stopped at that point, it might be a little bathetic.","So these Kings and Queens entered the thicket, and before they had gone a score of paces, they all remembered that the thing they had seen was called a lamppost, and before they had gone twenty more, they noticed that they were making their way not through branches but through coats. And next moment they all came tumbling out of a wardrobe door into the empty room, and they were no longer Kings and Queens in their hunting array but just Peter, Susan, Edmund, and Lucy in their old clothes. It was the same day and the same hour of the day on which they had all gone into the wardrobe to hide. Mrs. Macready and the visitors were still talking I the passage; but luckily they never came into the empty room and so the children weren\u2019t caught.And that would have been the very end of the story if it hadn\u2019t been that they felt they really must explain to the Professor why four of the coats out of his wardrobe were missing. And the Professor, who was a very remarkable man, didn\u2019t tell them not to be silly or not to tell lies, but believed the whole story. \u201cNo, he said, \u201cI don\u2019t think it will be any good trying to go back through the wardrobe door to get the coats. You won\u2019t get into Narnia again by that route. Nor would the coats be much use by now if you did! Eh? What\u2019s that? Yes, of course you\u2019ll get back to Narnia again someday. Once a King in Narnia, always a King in Narnia. But don\u2019t go trying to use the same route twice. Indeed, don\u2019t try to get there at all. It\u2019ll happen when you\u2019re not looking for it. And don\u2019t talk too much about it even among yourselves. And don\u2019t mention it to anyone else unless you find that they\u2019ve had adventures of the same sort themselves. What\u2019s that? How will you know? Oh, you\u2019ll know all right. Odd things they say--even their looks--will let the secret out. Keep your eyes open. Bless me, what do they teach them at these schools?\u201dAnd that is the very end of the adventures of the wardrobe. But if the Professor was right, it was only the beginning of the adventures of Narnia.\u201d","No one ever told me that grief felt so like fear.

We cannot create them for ourselves, and we must not demand them as a right. But the great thing to remember is that, though our feelings come and go, His love for us does not.","The Holiness of God is something more and other than moral perfection: His claim upon us is something more and other than the claim of moral duty.","Whatever he says, let his inner resolution be not to bear whatever comes to him, but to bear it \u2018for a reasonable period\u2019\u2014and let the reasonable period be shorter than the trial is likely to last.","But for a Christian, there are, strictly speaking, no chances.

He rode upon a strong dappled horse with flowing mane and tail, and his stirrups and bridle were inlaid with silver. The spike of a helmet projected from the middle of his silken turban and he wore a shirt of chain mail. By his side hung a curving scimitar; a round shield studded with bosses of brass hung at his back, and his right hand grasped a lance. His face was dark, but this did not surprise Shasta because all the people of Calormen are like that; what did surprise him was the man\u2019s beard which was dyed crimson, and curled and gleaming with scented oil. But Arsheesh knew by the gold on the stranger\u2019s bare arm that he was a Tarkaan or great lord, and he bowed kneeling before him till his beard touched the earth, and made signs to Shasta to kneel also. The stranger demanded hospitality for the night which of course the fisherman dared not refuse. All the best they had was set before the Tarkaan for supper (and he didn\u2019t think much of it) and Shasta, as always happened when the fisherman had company, was given a hunk of bread and turned out of the cottage. On these occasions he usually slept with the donkey in its little thatched stable. But it was much too early to go to sleep yet, and Shasta, who had never learned that it is wrong to listen behind doors, sat down with his ear to a crack in the wooden wall of the cottage to hear what the grown-ups were talking about.","How should man live save as glassTo let the white light without flame, the Father, passUnstained ...","To read\u2014without military knowledge or good maps\u2014accounts of fighting which were distorted before they reached the Divisional general and further distorted before they left him and then \'written up\' out of all recognition by journalists, to strive to master what will be contradicted the next day, to fear and hope intensely on shaky evidence, is surely an ill use of the mind. Even in peacetime I think those are very wrong who say that schoolboys should be encouraged to read newspapers. Nearly all that a boy reads there in his teens will be known before he is twenty to have been false in emphasis and interpretation, if not in fact as well, and most of it will have lost all importance. Most of what he remembers he will therefore have to unlearn; and he will probably have acquired an incurable taste for vulgarity and sensationalism and the fatal habit of fluttering from paragraph to paragraph to learn how an actress has been divorced in California, a train derailed in France, and quadruplets born in new Zealand.","I believe this not in the sense that it is part of my creed, but in the sense that it is one of my opinions.

The examination was held in the Hall of Oriel, and we all wrote in greatcoats and mufflers and wearing at least our left-hand gloves. The Provost, old Phelps, gave out the papers. I remember very little about them, but I suppose I was outshone in pure classics by many of my rivals and succeeded on my general knowledge and dialectics.

This dim uneasiness needs careful handling. If it gets too strong it may wake him up...if you suppress it entirely...we lose an element in the situation which can be turned to good account. If such a feeling is allowed to live, but not allowed to become irresistible and flower into real repentance, it has one invaluable tendency. It increases the patient\u2019s reluctance to think about the Enemy. All humans at nearly all times have some such reluctance; but when thinking of Him involves facing and intensifying a whole vague cloud of half-conscious guilt, this reluctance is increased tenfold...In this state your patient will not omit, but he will increasingly dislike, his religious duties...He will want his prayers to be unreal, for he will dread nothing so much as effective contact with the Enemy.","C.S. Lewis in his book The Screwtape Letters in a series of messages from a devil named Screwtape to his nephew, a junior demon Wormwood training in the world, has Screwtape offering the following advice in order to draw a Christian away from God: \\"Talk to him about moderation in all things. If you can once get him to the point of thinking that religion is all very well up to a point. you can feel quite happy about his soul. A moderated religion is as good for us as no religion at all-and more amusing.","Tonight all the hells of young grief have opened again; the mad words, the bitter resentment, the fluttering in the stomach, the nightmare unreality, the wallowed-in tears.

There is no need to speak with Edmond about his past.","You know how this wine is blended? Different types of Pharisee have been harvested, trodden, and fermented together to produce its subtle flavour. Types that were most antagonistic to one another on earth. Some were all rules and relics and rosaries; others were all drab clothes, long faces, and petty traditional abstinences from wine or cards or the theatre. Both had in common their self-righteousness and the almost infinite distance between their actual outlook and anything the Enemy really is or commands. The wickedness of other religions was the really live doctrine in the religion of each; slander was its gospel and denigration its litany. How they hated each other up there where the sun shone!","I expect most witches are like that.

He would rather the man thought himself a great architect or a great poet and then forgot about it, than that he should spend much time and pains trying to think himself a bad one. Your efforts to instil either vain glory or false modesty into the patient will therefore be met from the Enemy\u2019s side with the obvious reminder that a man is not usually called upon to have an opinion of his own talents at all, since he can very well go on improving them to the best of his ability without deciding on his own precise niche in the temple of Fame...The Enemy will also try to render real in the patient\u2019s mind...the doctrine that they did not create themselves, that their talents were given them, and that they might as well be proud of the colour of their hair...Even of his sins the Enemy does not want him to think too much: once they are repented, the sooner the man turns his attention outward, the better the Enemy is pleased","of course, even in the hall, you must begin trying to obey the rules which are common to the whole house.","\u0627\u0644\u0623\u0643\u0644 \u0648\u0627\u0644\u0642\u0631\u0627\u0621\u0629 \u0645\u062a\u0639\u062a\u0627\u0646 \u0631\u0627\u0626\u0639\u062a\u0627\u0646 .. \u0648\u0633\u0648\u064a\u0627\u064b \u064a\u0635\u0628\u062d\u0627 \u0623\u0643\u062b\u0631 \u0625\u0645\u062a\u0627\u0639\u0627\u064b","Now that I am a Christian I do have moods in which the whole thing looks very improbable: but when I was an atheist I had moods in which Christianity looked terribly probable.","A man may have to die for his country, but no man must, in an exclusive sense, live for his country.

Then, in great wooden cups and bowls and mazers, wreathed with ivy, came the wines; dark, thick ones like syrups of mulberry juice, and clear red ones like red jellies liquefied, and yellow wines and green wines and yellow-green and greenish-yellow.But for the tree people different fare was provided. When Lucy saw Clodsley Shovel and his moles scuffling up the turf in various places (when Bacchus had pointed out to them) and realized that the trees were going to eat earth it gave her rather a shudder. But when she saw the earths that were actually brought to them she felt quite different. They began with a rich brown loam that looked almost exactly like chocolate; so like chocolate, in fact, that Edmund tried a piece of it, but he did not find it all nice. When the rich loam had taken the edge off their hunger, the trees turned to an earth of the kind you see in Somerset, which is almost pink. They said it was lighter and sweeter. At the cheese stage they had a chalky soil, and then went on to delicate confections of the finest gravels powdered with choice silver sand. They drank very little wine, and it made the Hollies very talkative: for the most part they quenched their thirst with deep draughts of mingled dew and rain, flavored with forest flowers and the airy taste of the thinnest clouds.","It is no good asking for a simple religion.

It demands that good should be original and evil a mere perversion; that good should be the tree and evil the ivy; that good should be able to see all round evil (as when sane men understand lunacy) while evil cannot retaliate in kind; that good should be able to exist on its own while evil requires the good on which it is parasitic in order to continue its parasitic existence.","Come in by the gold gates or not at all,Take of my fruit for others or forbear,For those who steal or those who climb my wallShall find their heart\u2019s desire and find despair.","Isn\u2019t it absolutely essential to keep a fierce Left and a fierce Right, both on their toes and each terrified of the other?","But inside of the tree itself, in the very sap of it, the tree never forgot that other tree in Narnia to which it belonged.

Thus, while being permanently treacherous to at least two sets of people, he will feel, instead of shame, a continual undercurrent of self-satisfaction.

He therefore, I believe, wants them to attend chiefly to two things, to eternity itself, and to that point at which they call the Present. For the Present is the point at which time touches eternity. Of the present moment, and of it only, humans have an experience analogous to the experience which our Enemy has of reality as a whole; in it alone freedom and actuality are offered them.

Very true: most right and proper, I\u2019m sure, and I\u2019m very glad you have been taught to do it. But of course you must understand that rules of that sort, however excellent they may be for little boys\u2014and servants\u2014and women\u2014and even people in general, can\u2019t possibly be expected to apply to profound students and great thinkers and sages. No, Digory. Men like me, who possess hidden wisdom, are freed from common rules just as we are cut off from common pleasures. Ours, my boy, is a high and lonely destiny.\u201d","and when it was over they wished it was going to begin again.","A society in which conjugal infidelity is tolerated must always be in the long run a society adverse to women. Women, whatever a few male songs and satires may say to the contrary, are more naturally monogamous than men; it is a biological necessity. Where promiscuity prevails, they will therefore always be more often the victims than the culprits. Also, domestic happiness is more necessary to them than to us. And the quality by which they most easily hold a man, their beauty, decreases every year after they have come to maturity, but this does not happen to those qualities of personality \u2014women don\u2019t really care two cents about our looks\u2014by which we hold women. Thus in the ruthless war of promiscuity women are at a double disadvantage. They play for higher stakes and are also more likely to lose. I have no sympathy with moralists who frown at the increasing crudity of female provocativeness. These signs of desperate competition fill me with pity.","But what am I to do? I must have some drug, and reading isn\'t a strong enough drug now. By writing it all down (all? - no: one thought in a hundred) I believe I get a little outside it. That\'s how I\'d defend it to H. But ten to one she\'d see a hole in the defence.","We...advance toward a state of society in which not only each man but every impulse in each man claims carte blanche.","On the other hand, only he who loses his life will save it. We are baptized into the death of Christ, and it is the remedy for the Fall. Death is, in fact, what some modern people call \'ambivalent.\' It is Satan\'s great weapon and also God\'s great weapon: it is holy and unholy, our supreme disgrace and our only hope; the thing Christ came to conquer and the means by which he conquered.","You might say that when two Christians are following Christ together there is not twice as much Christianity as when they are apart, but sixteen times as much.","people quite often do what seemed impossible before they did it. It is wonderful what you can do when you have to.","I who know many present things by my art,\\" replied the Hermit with a smile, \\"have yet little knowledge of things future. Therefore I do not know whether any man or woman or beast in the whole world will be alive when the sun sets tonight. But be of good hope.

Is Maleldil a beast that we can stop His path, or a leaf that we can twist His shape? Whatever you do, He will make good of it. But not the good He had prepared for you if you had obeyed Him. That is lost for ever. The first King and first Mother of our world did the forbidden thing, and He brought good of it in the end. But what they did was not good, and what they lost we have not seen.

Other ages, of which the present is one, are unbalanced and prone to faction, and it is our business to inflame them.","But he could never bear mice.","Fix in his mind the idea that humility consists in trying to believe those talents to be less valuable than he believes them to be. No doubt they are in fact less valuable than he believes, but that is not the point. The great thing is to make him value an opinion for some quality other than truth, thus introducing an element of dishonesty and make-believe into the heart of what otherwise threatens to become a virtue.","If I had really cared, as I thought I did, about the sorrows of the world, I should not have been so overwhelmed when my own sorrow came.","It is when we are doing things together that friendship springs up \u2013 painting, sailing ships, praying, philosophizing, and fighting shoulder to shoulder.

All Hell is smaller than one pebble of your earthly world: but it is smaller than one atom of this world, the Real World. Look at yon butterfly. If it swallowed all Hell, Hell would not be big enough to do it any harm or to have any taste.","Your natural life is derived from your parents; that does not mean it will stay there if you do nothing about it. You can lose it by neglect, or you can drive it away by committing suicide. You have to feed it and look after it: but always remember you are not making it, you are only keeping up a life you got from someone else. In the same way a Christian can lose the Christ-life which has been put into him, and he has to make efforts to keep it.","He therefore, I believe, wants them to attend chiefly to two things, to eternity itself, and to that point of time which they call the Present. For the Present is the point at which time touches eternity. Of the present moment, and of it only, humans have an experience analogous to the experience which our Enemy has of reality as a whole; in it alone freedom and actuality are offered them. He would therefore have them continually concerned either with eternity (which means being concerned with Him) or with the Present\u2014either meditating on their eternal union with, or separation from, Himself, or else obeying the present voice of conscience, bearing the present cross, receiving the present grace, giving thanks for the present pleasure.","It was like the first spasm of a well-remembered pain warning a man who had thought he was cured that his family have deceived him and he is dying after all.","\u0218i nu mergi c\u0103lare pe un drum sau printr-un parc ori peste dune, ci prin Narnia, prim\u0103vara, pe alei de fag sau prin lumini\u0219uri \xeensorite \xeenconjurate de stejari, prin livezi s\u0103lbatice de cire\u0219i albi ca z\u0103pada, pe l\xe2ng\u0103 cascade tumultuoase \u0219i st\xe2nci acoperite de mu\u0219chi \u0219i pe\u0219teri ad\xe2nci, sus pe dealuri \xeen b\u0103taia v\xe2ntului \u0219i peste coaste de munte acoperite de iarb\u0103 neagr\u0103 \u0219i de-a lungul crestelor ame\u021bitoare \u0219i din nou prin v\u0103i s\u0103lbatice \u0219i peste covoare de flori albastre.","But as for Aslan himself, the Beavers and the children didn\u2019t know what to do or say when they saw him. People who have not been in Narnia sometimes think that a thing cannot be good and terrible at the same time. If the children had ever thought so, they were cured of it now. For when they tried to look at Aslan\u2019s face they just caught a glimpse of the golden mane and the great, royal, solemn, overwhelming eyes; and then they found they couldn\u2019t look at him and went all trembly.\u201cGo on, whispered Mr. Beaver.\u201cNo,\u201d whispered Peter, \u201cyou first.\u201d\u201cNo, Sons of Adam before animals,\u201d whispered Mr. Beaver back again.\u201cSusan,\u201d whispered Peter, \u201cwhat about you?

Then at last Peter realized that it was up to him. He drew his sword and raised it to the salute and hastily saying to the others, \u201cCome on. Pull yourselves together,\u201d he advanced to the Lion and said, \u201cWe have come--Aslan.\u201d\u201cWelcome, Peter, Son of Adam,\u201d said Aslan. \u201cWelcome, Susan and Lucy, Daughters of Eve.\u201d","Once they knew that some changes were for the better, and others for the worse, and others again indifferent. We have largely removed this knowledge. For the descriptive adjective \u2018unchanged\u2019 we have substituted the emotional adjective \u2018stagnant\u2019.

But if you had asked almost any of the great Christians of old, he would have replied, Love. You see what has happened? A negative term has been substituted for a positive, and this is of more than philological importance. The negative idea of Unselfishness carries with it the suggestion not primarily of securing good things for others, but of going without them ourselves, as if our abstinence and not their happiness was the important point. I do not think this is the Christian virtue of Love. The New Testament has lots to say about self-denial, but not about self-denial as an end in itself. We are told to deny ourselves and to take up our crosses in order that we may follow Christ;","The load, or weight, or burden of my neighbour\u2019s glory should be laid on my back, a load so heavy that only humility can carry it, and the backs of the proud will be broken.","Remember, always, that He really like the little vermin (mankind), and sets an absurd value on the distinctness of every one of them. When He talks of their losing their selves, He means only abandoning the clamour of self-will; once they have done that, He really gives them back all their personality, and boasts that when they are wholly His they will be more themselves than ever.","Bad laws make hard cases.","For every one pupil who needs to be guarded from a weak excess of sensibility there are three who need to be awakened from the slumber of cold vulgarity.","When you find yourself wanting to turn your children, or pupils, or even your neighbours, into people exactly like yourself, remember that God probably never meant them to be that.

Sometimes the surprise is the opposite one; you are presented with exactly the same sort of country you thought you had left behind miles ago. That is when you wonder whether the valley isn\u2019t a circular trench. But it isn\u2019t.

The we\'ll all be comfortable.","Even in human life we have seen the passion to dominate, almost to digest, one\'s fellow, to make his whole intellectual and emotional life merely an extension of one\'s own\u2014to hate one\'s hatreds and resent one\'s grievances and indulge one\'s egotism through him as well as through oneself. His own little store of passion must of course be suppressed to make room for ours. If he resists this suppression he is being very selfish.","He could not feel that they were an island of life journeying through an abyss of death. He felt almost the opposite--that life was waiting outside the little iron egg-shell in which they rode, ready at any moment to break in, and that, if it killed them, it would kill them by excess of its vitality. He hoped passionately that if they were to perish they would perish by the \\"unbodying\\" of the space-ship and not by suffocation within it. To be let out, to be free, to dissolve into the ocean of eternal noon, seemed to him at certain moments a consummation even more desirable than their return to Earth. And if he had felt some such lift of the heart when first he passed through heaven on their outward journey, he felt it now tenfold, for now he was convinced that the abyss was full of life in the most literal sense, full of living creatures.","We are a seed patiently waiting in the earth: waiting to come up a flower in the Gardener\'s good time, up into the real world, the real waking.

Each of us by nature sees the whole world from one point of view with a perspective and a selectiveness peculiar to himself. And even when we build disinterested fantasies, they are saturated with, and limited by, our own psychology. To acquiesce in this particularity on the sensuous level\u2014in other words, not to discount perspective\u2014would be lunacy. We should then believe that the railway line really grew narrower as it receded into the distance. But we want to escape the illusions of perspective on higher levels too. We want to see with other eyes, to imagine with other imaginations, to feel with other hearts, as well as with our own. \xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0[138] We are not content to be Leibnitzian monads. We demand windows. Literature as Logos is a series of windows, even of doors. One of the things we feel after reading a great work is \u2018I have got out\u2019. Or from another point of view, \u2018I have got in\u2019; pierced the shell of some other monad and discovered what it is like inside. Good reading, therefore, though it is not essentially an affectional or moral or intellectual activity, has something in common with all three. In love we escape from our self into one other. In the moral sphere, every act of justice or charity involves putting ourselves in the other person\u2019s place and thus transcending our own competitive particularity. In coming to understand anything we are rejecting the facts as they are for us in favour of the facts as they are. The primary impulse of each is to maintain and aggrandise himself. The secondary impulse is to go out of the self, to correct its provincialism and heal its loneliness. In love, in virtue, in the pursuit of knowledge, and in the reception of the arts, we are doing this. Obviously this process can be described either as an enlargement or as a temporary annihilation of the self. But that is an old paradox; \u2018he that loseth his life shall save it\u2019. We therefore delight to enter into other","Even the Lion wept: great Lion-tears, each tear more precious than the Earth would be if it was a single solid diamond.","But inside itself, in the very sap of it, the tree (so to speak) never forgot that other tree in Narnia to which it belonged. Sometimes it would move mysteriously when there was no wind blowing: I think that when this happened there were high winds in Narnia and the English tree quivered.... However that might be, it was proved later that there was still magic in its wood. For when Digory was quite middle-aged...there was a great storm all over the south of England which blew the tree down. He couldn\'t bear to have it simply chopped up for firewood, so he had part of the timber made into a wardrobe, which he put in his big house in the country. And though he himself did not discover the magic properties of that wardrobe, someone else did....","It seems that there is a general rule in the moral universe which may be formulated, \'The higher, the more in danger\'. The \'average sensual man\' who is sometimes unfaithful to his wife, sometimes tipsy, always a little selfish, now and then (within the law) a trifle sharp in his deals, is certainly, by ordinary standards, a \'lower\' type than the man whose soul is filled with some great Cause, to which he will subordinate his appetites, his fortune, and even his safety. But it is out of the second man that something really fiendish can be made; an Inquisitor, a Member of the Committee of Public Safety. It is great men, potential saints, not little men, who become merciless fanatics. Those who are readiest to die for a cause may easily become those who are readiest to kill for it. ...For the supernatural, entering a human soul, opens to it new possibilities of both good and evil. From that point the road branches: one way to sanctity, love, humility, the other to spiritual pride, self-righteousness, persecuting zeal. And no way back to the mere humdrum virtues and vices of the un-awakened soul. If the Divine call does not make us better, it will make us very much worse. Of all bad men religious bad men are the worst. Of all created beings, the wickedest is one who originally stood in the immediate presence of God. There seems no way out of this. It gives a new application to Our Lord\'s words about \'counting the cost\'.","This must be a simply enormous wardrobe!\' thought Lucy, going still further in....","When Adam ate the irrevocable apple, ThouSaw\'st beyond death the resurrection of the dead","some of the miracles do locally what God has already done universally: others do locally what He has not yet done, but will do.","We debated whether the future was like a line you can\u2019t see or like a line that is not yet drawn.","It is idle to point out to the perverted man the horror of his perversion: while the fierce fit is on, that horror is the very spice of his craving.

The trees grew close together and were so leafy that he could get no glimpse of the sky. All the light was green light that came through the leaves: but there must have been a very strong sun overhead, for this green daylight was bright and warm. It was the quietest wood you could possibly imagine. There were no birds, no insects, no animals, and no wind. You could almost feel the trees growing. The pool he had just got out of was not the only pool. There were dozens of others- a pool every few yards as far as his eyes could reach.

You asked for a loving God: you have one. The great spirit you so lightly invoked, the \'lord of terrible aspect\', is present: not a senile benevolence that drowsily wishes you to be happy in your own way, not the cold philanthropy of a conscientious magistrate, nor the care of a host who feels responsible for the comfort of his guests, but the consuming fire Himself, the Love that made the worlds......How this should be, I do not know: it passes reason to explain why any creatures, not to say creatures such as we should have a value so prodigious in their Creator\'s eyes. It is certainly a burden of glory, not only beyond our deserts but also, except in rare moments of grace, beyond our desiring; we are inclined, like the maidens in the old play, to deprecate the love of Zeus.","In general the parallel between the popular uses of music and of pictures is close enough. Both consist of \u2018using\u2019 rather than \u2018receiving\u2019. Both rush hastily forward to do things with the work of art instead of waiting for it to do something to them.","You can\u2019t see anything properly while your eyes are blurred with tears.

Perhaps, more strictly, like suspense. Or like waiting; just hanging about waiting for something to happen. It gives life a permanently provisional feeling.","The Devil and his angels have... persuad[ed]... humans that a curious, and usually short-lived, experience which they call \\"being in love\\" is the only respectable ground for marriage; that marriage can, and ought to, render this excitement permanent; and that a marriage which does not do so is no longer binding. This idea [comes from their] parody of an idea that came from [God]... Things are to be many, yet somehow also one. The good of one self is to be the good of another. This... He calls Love, and this... can be detected under all He does and even all He is... He introduces into matter... the organism, in which the parts are [set at odds with] their natural destiny of competition and made to cooperate... In... humans [God] has... associated affection between the parties with sexual desire. He has also made the offspring dependent on the parents and given the parents an impulse to support it-thus producing the Family, which is like the organism, [but] the members are more distinct, yet also united in a more conscious and responsible way... [Heavenly Father] described a married couple as \\"one flesh.\\" He did not say \\"a happily married couple\\" or \\"a couple who married because they were in love\\"...","I say,\\" said Edmund as they walked away, \\"I suppose it \'is\' all right.

No one has time to do more than a very few things well before he is twenty, and when we force a boy to be a mediocrity in a dozen subjects we destroy his standards, perhaps for life.","You\'re a tree in whose shadow we can\'t thrive. We want to be our own.","But this is one of the rewards of reading the Old Testament regularly. You keep on discovering more and more what a tissue of quotations from it the New Testament is; how constantly our Lord repeated, reinforced, continued, refined, and sublimated, the Judaic ethics, how very seldom He introduced a novelty...The Light which has lightened every man from the beginning may shine more clearly but cannot change. The Origin cannot suddenly start being, in the popular sense of the word, \\"original\\".","and of course, the more enchanted you get, the more you feel that you are not enchanted at all","They were astonished at what he had to tell them of human history\u2014of war, slavery and prostitution. \u201cIt is because they have no Oyarsa, said one of the pupils. \u201cIt is because every one of them wants to be a little Oyarsa himself,\u201d said Augray.\u201d","Every poet and musician and artist, but for Grace, is drawn away from love of the thing he tells, to love of the telling till, down in Deep Hell, they cannot be interested in God at all but only in what they say about Him.

Long Live Queen Lucy!\u201cOnce a King or Queen in Narnia, always a King or Queen. Bear it well, Sons of Adam! Bear it well, Daughters of Eve!\u201d said Aslan.And through the eastern door, which was wide open, came the voices of the mermen and the mermaids swimming close to the castle steps and singing in honor of their new Kings and Queens. So the children sat in their thrones and scepters were put into their hands and they gave rewards and honors to all their friends, to Tumnus the Faun, and to the Beavers, and Giant Rumblebuffin, to the leopards, and the good centaurs and the good dwarfs, and to the lion. And that night there was a great feast in Cair Paravel, and revelry and dancing, and gold flashed and wine flowed, and answering to the music inside, but stranger, sweeter, and more piercing, came the music of the sea-people. But amid all these rejoicings Aslan himself quietly slipped away. And when the Kings and Queens noticed that he wasn\u2019t there, they said nothing about it. For Mr. Beaver had warned them. \u201cHe\u2019ll be coming and going,\u201d he had said. \u201cOne day you\u2019ll see him and another you won\u2019t.

He\u2019s wild, you know. Not like a tame lion.\u201d","All the trees of the world appeared to be rushing towards Aslan. But as they drew nearer they looked less like trees, and when the whole crowd, bowing and curtsying and waving thin long arms to Aslan, were all around Lucy, she saw that it was a crowd of human shapes. Pale birch-girls were tossing their heads, willow-women pushed back their hair from their brooding faces to gaze on Aslan, the queenly beeches stood still and adored him, shaggy oak-men, lean and melancholy elms, shock-headed hollies (dark themselves, but their wives all bright with berries) and gay rowans, all bowed and rose again, shouting, \\"Aslan, Aslan!\\" in their various husky or creaking or wave-like voices.","We do not want merely to see beauty, though, God knows, even that is bounty enough. We want something else which can hardly be put into words \u2014 to be united with the beauty we see, to pass into it, to receive it into ourselves, to bathe in it, to become part of it","the new King of Narnia helped both the children up: that is, he gave Digory a rough heave and set Polly as gently and daintily on the horse\u2019s back as if she were made of china and might break.","Revenge loses sight of the end in the means, but it\'s end is not wholly bad - it wants the evil of the bad man to be to him what it is to everyone else. This is proved by the fact that the avenger wants the guilty party not merely to suffer, but to suffer at his hands, and to know it, and to know why. Hence the impulse to taunt the guilty man with his crime at the moment of taking vengeance: hence, too, such natural expressions as \'I wonder how he\'d like it if the same thing were done to him\' or \'I\'ll teach him\'. For the same reason when we are going to abuse a man in words we say we are going to \'let him know what we think of him\'.","Milton was right,\u2019 said my Teacher. \u2018The choice of every lost soul can be expressed in the words \u201cBetter to reign in Hell than serve in Heaven.","Predestination and freedom were apparently identical. He could no longer see any meaning in the many arguments he had heard on this subject.","Men like me, who possess hidden wisdom, are freed from common rules just as we are cut off from common pleasures. Ours, my boy, is a high and lonely destiny.","I once ventured to say to an old clergyman who was voicing this sort of patriotism, \\"But, sir, aren\'t we told that every people thinks its own men the bravest and its own women the fairest in the world?\\" He replied with total gravity\u2014he could not have been graver if he had been saying the Creed at the altar\u2014\\"Yes, but in England it\'s true.","My contention is that good men (not bad men) consistently acting upon that position would act as cruelly and unjustly as the greatest tyrants. They might in some respects act even worse. Of all tyrannies a tyranny sincerely exercised for the good of its victims may be the most oppressive. It may be better to live under robber barons than under omnipotent moral busybodies. The robber baron\'s cruelty may sometimes sleep, his cupidity may at some point be satiated; but those who torment us for our own good will torment us without end for they do so with the approval of their own conscience. They may be more likely to go to Heaven yet at the same time likelier to make a Hell of earth.","I might be asked, \u2018Do you equally reject the approach which begins with the question \u201cWhat do modern children need? \u2014 in other words, with the moral or didactic approach?\u2019 I think the answer is Yes. Not because I don\u2019t like stories to have a moral: certainly not because I think children dislike a moral. Rather because I feel sure that the question \u2018What do modern children need?\u2019 will not lead you to a good moral. If we ask that question we are assuming too superior an attitude. It would be better to ask \u2018What moral do I need?\u2019 for I think we can be sure that what does not concern us deeply will not deeply interest our readers, whatever their age. But it is better not to ask the question at all. Let the pictures tell you their own moral. For the moral inherent in them will rise from whatever spiritual roots you have succeeded in striking during the whole course of your life. But if they don\u2019t show you any moral, don\u2019t put one in.\u201d","We are all trying to let our mind and heart go their own way\u2014centred on money or pleasure or ambition\u2014and hoping, in spite of this, to behave honestly and chastely and humbly. And that is exactly what Christ warned us you could not do. As He said, a thistle cannot produce figs. If I am a field that contains nothing but grass-seed, I cannot produce wheat. Cutting the grass may keep it short: but I shall still produce grass and no wheat. If I want to produce wheat, the change must go deeper than the surface. I must be ploughed up and re-sown.","Once you have realised that the Frenchmen like caf\xe9 complet just as we like bacon and eggs\u2014why, good luck to them and let them have it. The last thing we want is to make everywhere else just like our own home. It would not be home unless it were different.","If so, it is inaccurate to say that the majority \u2018enjoy bad pictures\u2019. They enjoy the ideas suggested to them by bad pictures. They do not really see the pictures as they are. If they did, they could not live with them. There is a sense in which bad work never is nor can be enjoyed by anyone. The people do not like the bad picture because the faces in them are like those of puppets and there is no real mobility in the lines that are meant to be moving and no energy or grace in the whole design. These faults are simply invisible to them; as the actual face of the Teddy-bear is invisible to an imaginative and warm-hearted child when it is absorbed in its play. It no longer notices that the eyes are only beads.","The process which, if not checked, will abolish Man goes on apace among Communists and Democrats no less than among Fascists. The methods may (at first) differ in brutality. But many a mild-eyed scientist in pince-nez, many a popular dramatist, many an amateur philosopher in our midst, means in the long run just the same as the Nazi rulers of Germany. Traditional values are to be \u2018debunked\u2019 and mankind to be cut out into some fresh shape at the will (which must, by hypothesis, be an arbitrary will) of some few lucky people in one lucky generation which has learned how to do it. The belief that we can invent \u2018ideologies\u2019 at pleasure, and the consequent treatment of mankind as mere ulh, specimens, preparations, begins to affect our very language. Once we killed bad men: now we liquidate unsocial elements. Virtue has become integration and diligence dynamism, and boys likely to be worthy of a commission are \u2018potential officer material\u2019. Most wonderful of all, the virtues of thrift and temperance, and even of ordinary intelligence, are sales-resistance.","The real reason for democracy is just the reverse. Mankind is so fallen that no man can be trusted with unchecked power over his fellows. Aristotle said that some people were only fit to be slaves. I do not contradict him. But I reject slavery because I see no men fit to be masters.","the loving and the devouring are all one","Dicen que los cobardes mueren muchas veces: eso les pasa a los seres amados.","Doesn\'t the mere fact of putting something into words itself involve exaggeration? Prose words, I mean.

Perhaps, more strictly, like suspense. Or like waiting; just hanging about waiting for something to happen. It gives life a permanently provisional feeling. It doesn\u2019t seem worth starting anything. I can\u2019t settle down. I yawn, I fidget, I smoke too much. Up till this I always had too little time. Now there is nothing but time. Almost pure time, empty successiveness.","And there you can see again how little difference there is between dying and being married.","He Himself is the fuel our spirits were designed to burn, or the food our spirits were designed to feed on.

All alike, so far as I could judge from my own exploration of the lower world, were wholly unreliable, and all equally incurious about the country in which they had arrived. They repelled every attempt to teach them, and when they found that nobody listened to them they went back, one by one, to the bus.This curious wish to describe Hell turned out, however, to be only the mildest form of a desire very common among the Ghosts\u2014the desire to extend Hell, to bring it bodily, if they could, into Heaven.","The first and fatal charm of national repentance is, therefore, the encouragement it gives us to turn from the bitter task of repenting our own sins to the congenial one of bewailing\u2014but, first, of denouncing\u2014the conduct of others.","Allow me to introduce myself.

After each failure, ask forgiveness, pick yourself up, and try again. Very often what God first helps us towards is not the virtue itself but just this power of always trying again. For however important chastity (or courage, or truthfulness, or any other virtue) may be, this process trains us in habits of the soul which are more important still. It cures our illusions about ourselves and teaches us to depend on God.","The heart never takes the place of the head: but it can, and should, obey it","God doesn\u2019t want something from us.

You must find out why it went out of date. Was it ever refuted (and if so by whom, where, and how conclusively) or did it merely die away as fashions do? If the latter, this tells us nothing about its truth or falsehood. From seeing this, one passes to the realization that our own age is also a \\"period,\\" and certainly has, like all periods, its own characteristic illusions.

We want something else which can hardly be put into words-to be united with the beauty we see, to pass into it, to receive it into ourselves, to bathe in it, to become part of it.That is why we have peopled air and earth and water with gods and goddesses and nymphs and elves-that, though we cannot, yet these projections can, enjoy in themselves that beauty grace, and power of which Nature is the image. That is why the poets tell us such lovely falsehoods. They talk as if the west wind could really sweep into a human soul; but it can\u2019t.

The content of our obedience - the thing we are commanded to do -- will always be something intrinsically good, something we ought to do even if (by an impossible supposition_ God had not commanded it.

He continued (what Arthur had begun) my education as a seeing, listening, smelling, receptive creature. Arthur had had his preference for the Homely.

Lucy grabbed at him from the other side and was dragged forward. And by this time either they had grown much smaller or the picture had grown bigger. Eustace jumped to try to pull it off the wall and found himself standing on the frame; in front of him was not glass but real sea, and wind and waves rushing up to the frame as they might to a rock. He lost his head and clutched at the other two who had jumped up beside him. There was a second of struggling and shouting, and just as they thought they had got their balance a great blue roller surged up round them, swept them off their feet, and drew them down into the sea. Eustace\u2019s despairing cry suddenly ended as the water got into his mouth.Lucy thanked her stars that she had worked hard at her swimming last summer term. It is true that she would have got on much better if she had used a slower stroke, and also that the water felt a great deal colder than it had looked while it was only a picture. Still, she kept her head and kicked her shoes off, as everyone ought to do who falls into deep water in their clothes. She even kept her mouth shut and her eyes open. They were still quite near the ship; she saw its green side towering high above them, and people looking at her from the deck.

Miss Prizzle found she was standing on grass in a forest glade. She clutched at her desk to steady herself, and found that the desk was a rose-bush. Wild people such as she had never even imagined were crowding round her. Then she saw the Lion, screamed and fled, and with her fled her class, who were mostly dumpy, prim little girls with fat legs. Gwendolen hesitated. \\"You\'ll stay with us, sweetheart?\\" said Aslan.\\"Oh, may I? Thank you, thank you,\\" said Gwendolen.

Then, as one might have expected, Eustace clutched at her in a panic and down they both went. When they came up again she saw a white figure diving off the ship\u2019s side. Edmund was close beside her now, treading water, and had caught the arms of the howling Eustace. Then someone else, whose face was vaguely familiar, slipped an arm under her from the other side. There was a lot of shouting going on from the ship, heads crowding together above the bulwarks, ropes being thrown. Edmund and the stranger were fastening ropes round her. After that followed what seemed a very long delay during which her face got blue and her teeth began chattering. In reality the delay was not very long; they were waiting till the moment when she could be got on board the ship without being dashed against its side. Even with all their best endeavors she had a bruised knee when she finally stood, dripping and shivering, on the deck. After her Edmund was heaved up, and then the miserable Eustace. Last of all came the stranger--a golden-headed boy some years older than herself.\u201cCa--Ca--Caspian! gasped Lucy as soon as she had breath enough. For Caspian it was; Caspian, the boy king of Narnia whom they had helped to set on the throne during their last visit. Immediately Edmund recognized him too.

And unless they are helping to increase and prolong and protect such moments, all the laws, parliaments, armies, courts, police, economics, etc., are simply a waste of time.","Day after day there rose a smell which Lucy found very hard to describe: sweet- yes, but not at all sleepy or overpowering, a fresh wild lonely smell that seemed to get into your brain-","Sat\xe1n cay\xf3 por la fuerza de gravedad, dijo Chesterton.3 Se debe representar el Infierno como un estado en el que todo el mundo est\xe1 perpetuamente pendiente de su propia dignidad y de su propio enaltecimiento, en el que todos se sienten agraviados, y en el que todos viven las pasiones mortalmente serias que son la envidia, la presunci\xf3n y el resentimiento.\u201d","As long as he does not convert it into action, it does not matter how much he thinks about this new repentance.","The settled happiness and security which we all desire, God withholds from us by the very nature of the world: but joy pleasure and merriment, He has scattered broadcast. We are never safe, but we have plenty of fun and some ecstasy ... Our Father refreshes us on the journey with some pleasant inns, but he will not encourage us to mistake them for home.","Five senses; an incurably abstract intellect; a haphazardly selective memory; a set of preconceptions and assumptions so numerous that I can never examine more than a minority of them\u2014never become even conscious of them all. How much of total reality can such an apparatus let through?","Nothing ever does half the good\u2014perhaps nothing ever does half the evil\u2014which is expected of it.","Keep them watching their own minds and trying to produce feelings there by the action of their own wills. When they meant to ask Him for charity, let them, instead, start trying to manufacture charitable feelings for themselves and not notice that this is what they are doing. When they meant to pray for courage, let them really be trying to feel brave. When they say they are praying for forgiveness, let them be trying to feel forgiven. Teach them to estimate the value of each prayer by their success in producing the desired feeling; and never let them suspect how much success or failure of that kind depends on whether they are well or ill, fresh or tired, at the moment.","If flesh and blood cannot inherit the Kingdom, that is not because they are too solid, too gross, too distinct, too \u201cillustrious with being. They are too flimsy, too transitory, too phantasmal.\u201d","The Enemy wants him, in the end, to be so free from any bias in his own favour that he can rejoice in his own talents as frankly and gratefully as in his neighbour\'s talents--or in a sunrise, an elephant, or a waterfall.","Y as\xed es como empez\xf3 la teolog\xeda. La gente ya sab\xeda de la existencia de Dios de una manera vaga. Entonces lleg\xf3 un hombre que afirm\xf3 ser Dios y que no era, sin embargo, la clase de hombre que se pod\xeda tachar de lun\xe1tico. Ese hombre hizo que le creyesen. Volvieron a encontrarlo despu\xe9s de que lo hubieran matado. Y luego, despu\xe9s de que hab\xedan sido formados en una peque\xf1a sociedad o comunidad, encontraron de alguna manera a Dios tambi\xe9n dentro de ellos: dirigi\xe9ndolos, haci\xe9ndolos capaces de hacer cosas que no hab\xedan podido hacer hasta entonces. Y cuando lo dilucidaron todo, encontraron que hab\xedan llegado a la definici\xf3n cristiana del Dios tripersonal. Esta definici\xf3n no es algo que hayamos inventado. La teolog\xeda es, en un sentido, conocimiento experimental. Son las religiones sencillas las que deben inventarse.","This is, I think, one little part of what Christ meant by saying that a thing will not really live unless it first dies. It is simply no good trying to keep any thrill: that is the very worst thing you can do. Let the thrill go - let it die away - go on through that period of death into the quieter interest and happiness that follow - and you will find you are living in a world of new thrills all the time. But if you decide to make thrills your regular diet and try to prolong them artificially, they will all get weaker and weaker, and fewer and fewer, and you will be a bored, disillusioned old man for the rest of your life. It is because so few people understand this that you find many middle-aged men and women maundering about their lost youth, at the very age when new horizons ought to be appearing and new doors opening all round them. It is much better fun to learn to swim than to go on endlessly (and hopelessly) trying to get back the feeling you had when you first went paddling as a small boy.","I do not think the forest would be so bright, nor the water so warm, nor love so sweet, if there were no danger in the lakes.","Cada vez que pensemos que nuestra vida religiosa nos est\xe1 haciendo sentir que somos buenos \u2014y sobre todo que somos mejores que los dem\xe1s\u2014 creo que podemos estar seguros de que es el diablo, y no Dios, quien est\xe1 obrando en nosotros. La aut\xe9ntica prueba de que estamos en presencia de Dios es que, o nos olvidamos por completo de nosotros mismos, o nos vemos como objetos peque\xf1os y despreciables. Y es mejor olvidarnos por completo de nosotros mismos.","We make men without chests and expect of them virtue and enterprise.","Cuando se trata de conocer a Dios, la iniciativa est\xe1 de Su lado. Si El no se revela, nada que pod\xe1is hacer vosotros os permitir\xe1 encontrarle.

He","The story of The Rape of the Lock, sylphs and all, could have been told, though not so effectively, in prose. The Odyssey and the Comedy have something to say that could have been said well, though not equally well, without verse. Most of the qualities Aristotle demands of a tragedy could occur in a prose play. Poetry and prose, however different in language, overlapped, almost coincided, in content. But modern poetry, if it \u2018says\u2019 anything at all, if it aspires to \u2018mean\u2019 as well as to \u2018be\u2019, says what prose could not say in any fashion. To read the old poetry involved learning a slightly different language; to read the new involves the unmaking of your mind, the abandonment of all the logical and narrative connections which you use in reading prose or in conversation. You must achieve a trance-like condition in which images, associations, and sounds operate without these. Thus the common ground between poetry and any other use of words is reduced almost to zero. In that way poetry is now more quintessentially poetical than ever before; \u2018purer\u2019 in the negative sense. It not only does (like all good poetry) what prose can\u2019t do: it deliberately refrains from doing anything that prose can do.Unfortunately, but inevitably, this process is accompanied by a steady diminution in the number of its readers. Some have blamed the poets for this, and some the people. I am not sure that there need be any question of blame. The more any instrument is refined and perfected for some particular function, the fewer those who have the skill, or the occasion, to handle it must of course become. Many use ordinary knives and few use surgeons\u2019 scalpels. The scalpel is better for operations, but it is no good for anything else. Poetry confines itself more and more to what only poetry can do; but this turns out to be something which not many people want done. Nor, of course, could they receive it if they did. Modern poetry is too difficult for them. It is idle to complain; poetry so pure as this must be difficult. But neither must the poets complain if they are unread. When the art of reading poetry requires talents hardly less exalted than the art of writing it, readers cannot be much more numerous than poets.The explication of poetry is already well entrenched as a scholastic and academic exercise. The intention to keep it there, to make proficiency in it the indispensable qualification for white-collared jobs, and thus to secure for poets and their explicators a large and permanent (because a conscript) audience, is avowed. It may possibly succeed. Without coming home any more than it now does to the \u2018business and bosoms\u2019 of most men, poetry may, in this fashion, reign for a millennium; providing material for the explication which teachers will praise as an incomparable discipline and pupils will accept as a necessary moyen de parvenir. But this is speculation.","It is our function to encourage the behaviour, the manners, the whole attitude of mind, which democracies naturally like and enjoy, because these are the very things which, if unchecked, will destroy democracy. You would almost wonder that even humans don\u2019t see it themselves.","Dios puede mostrarse a S\xed mismo tal como es realmente s\xf3lo a hombres reales. Y eso significa no s\xf3lo a hombres que son individualmente buenos, sino a hombres que est\xe1n unidos juntos en un cuerpo, am\xe1ndose unos a otros, ayud\xe1ndose unos a otros, ense\xf1\xe1ndose a Dios unos a otros. Puesto que eso es la que Dios quer\xeda que fuese la Humanidad: como m\xfasicos de una \xfanica orquesta, u \xf3rganos de un \xfanico cuerpo. En consecuencia, el \xfanico instrumento adecuado para aprender acerca de Dios es toda la comunidad cristiana, esper\xe1ndole juntos. La hermandad cristiana es, por as\xed decirlo, el equipo t\xe9cnico para esta ciencia: el equipo de laboratorio.","No doubt he must very soon realize that his own faith is in direct opposition to the assumptions on which all the conversation of his new friends is based. I don\'t think that matters much provided that you can persuade him to postpone any open acknowledge of the fact, and this, with the aid of shame, pride, modesty and vanity, will be easy to do. As long as the postponement lasts he will be in a false position. He will be silent when he ought to speak and laugh when he ought to be silent.","You cannot make men good by law: and without good men you cannot have a good society. That","Whenever they are attending to the Enemy Himself we are defeated, but there are ways of preventing them from doing so. The simplest is to turn their gaze away from Him towards themselves.5 Keep them watching their own minds6 and trying to produce feelings there by the action of their own wills.","It was the hardest work I\u2019d ever done, and, while it lasted, one could think of nothing else. I said not long before that work and weakness are comforters. But sweat is the kindest creature of the three\u2014far better than philosophy, as a cure for ill thoughts.","You must therefore conceal from the patient the true end of humility. Let him think of it not as self-forgetfulness but as a certain kind of opinion (namely, a little opinion) of his own talents and character.","fix his attention inward that he no longer looks beyond himself to see our Enemy or his own neighbours.","It remains to consider how we can retrieve this disaster. The great thing is to prevent his doing anything. As long as he does not convert it into action, it does not matter how much he thinks about this new repentance. Let the little brute wallow in it. Let him, if he has any bent that way, write a book about it; that is often an excellent way of sterilising the seeds which the Enemy plants in a human soul. Let him do anything but act.","When we try to keep within us an area that is our own, we try to keep an area of death.","We\u2019re following a guide we know nothing about. How do we know which side that bird is on? Why shouldn\u2019t it be leading us into a trap?\u201cThat\u2019s a nasty idea. Still--a robin, you know. They\u2019re good birds in all the stories I\u2019ve ever read. I\u2019m sure a robin wouldn\u2019t be on the wrong side.\u201d\u201cIf it comes to that, which is the right side? How do we know that the fauns are in the right and the Queen (yes, I know we\u2019ve been told she\u2019s a witch) is in the wrong? We don\u2019t really know anything about either.\u201d\u201cThe Faun saved Lucy.\u201d\u201cHe said he did, But how do we know? And there\u2019s another thing too.

There\u2019s no bargaining with Him.","And all the time the joke is that the word \u2018Mine\u2019 in its fully possessive sense cannot be uttered by a human being about anything. In the long run either Our Father or the Enemy will say \u2018Mine\u2019 of each thing that exists, and specially of each man. They will find out in the end, never fear, to whom their time, their souls, and their bodies really belong\u2014certainly not to them, whatever happens.","Aren\u2019t all these notes the senseless writhings of a man who won\u2019t accept the fact that there is nothing we can do with suffering except to suffer it? Who still thinks there is some device (if only he could find it) which will make pain not to be pain. It doesn\u2019t really matter whether you grip the arms of the dentist\u2019s chair or let your hands lie in your lap.

You could feel these tugging at your guts and fluttering in your diaphragm. But in Friendship\u2014in that luminous, tranquil, rational world of relationships freely chosen\u2014you got away from all that. This alone, of all the loves, seemed to raise you to the level of gods or angels. But then came Romanticism and \\"tearful comedy\\" and the \\"return to nature\\" and the exaltation of Sentiment; and in their train all that great wallow of emotion which, though often criticised, has lasted ever since. Finally, the exaltation of instinct, the dark gods in the blood; whose hierophants may be incapable of male friendship. Under this new dispensation all that had once commended this love now began to work against it. It had not tearful smiles and keepsakes and baby-talk enough to please the sentimentalists. There was not blood and guts enough about it to attract the primitivists. It looked thin and etiolated; a sort of vegetarian substitute for the more organic loves.","No creo que tengas mucha dificultad en mantener a tu paciente en la ignorancia.

By leading that life to the glory of God I do not, of course, mean any attempt to make our intellectual inquiries work out to edifying conclusions\u2026I mean the pursuit of knowledge and beauty, in a sense, for their own sake, but in a sense which does not exclude their being for God\u2019s sake. An appetite for these things exists in the human mind, and God makes no appetite in vain. We can therefore pursue knowledge as such, and beauty as such, in the sure confidence that by so doing we are either advancing to the vision of God ourselves or indirectly helping others to do so. Humility, no less than the appetite, encourages us to concentrate simply on the knowledge or the beauty, not too much concerning ourselves with their ultimate relevance to the vision of God. That relevance may not be intended for us but for our betters\u2014for men who come after and find the spiritual significance of what we dug out in blind and humble obedience to our vocation.","Man is man: for by his intellect he is mere spirit and by his appetite mere animal.","We do not look at trees either as Dryads or as beautiful objects while we cut them into beams: the first man who did so may have felt the price keenly, and the bleeding trees in Virgil and Spenser may be far-off echoes of that primeval sense of impiety. The stars lost their divinity as astronomy developed, and the Dying God has no place in chemical agriculture. [...] From this point of view the conquest of Nature appears in a new light. We reduce things to mere Nature in order that we may \'conquer\' them. We are always conquering Nature, because \'Nature\' is the name for what we have, to some extent, conquered.","Till that word can be dug out of us, why should they hear the babble that we think we mean? How can they meet us face to face till we have faces? \u2018Best","There are always plenty of rivals to our work. We are always falling in love or quarreling, looking for jobs or fearing to lose them, getting ill and recovering, following public affairs. If we let ourselves, we shall always be waiting for some distraction or other to end before we can really get down to our work. The only people who achieve much are those who want knowledge so badly that they seek it while the conditions are still unfavorable.\xa0Favorable conditions never come.\xa0There are, of course, moments when the pressure of the excitement is so great that only superhuman self-control could resist it. They come both in war and peace. We must do the best we can.The second enemy is frustration\u2014the feeling that we shall not have time to finish. If I say to you that no one has time to finish, that the longest human life leaves a man, in any branch of learning, a beginner, I shall seem to you to be saying something quite academic and theoretical. You would be surprised if you knew how soon one begins to feel the shortness of the tether, of how many things, even in middle life, we have to say \\"No time for that,\\" \\"Too late now,\\" and \\"Not for me.\\" But Nature herself forbids you to share that experience. A more Christian attitude, which can be attained at any age, is that of leaving futurity in God\'s hands. We may as well, for God will certainly retain it whether we leave it to Him or not. Never, in peace or war, commit your virtue or your happiness to the future. Happy work is best done by the man who takes his long-term plans somewhat lightly and works from moment to moment \\"as to the Lord.\\" It is only our daily bread that we are encouraged to ask for. The present is the only time in which any duty can be done or any grace received.","Friendship exhibits a glorious \\"nearness by resemblance\\" to Heaven itself where the very multitude of the blessed (which no man can number) increases the fruition which each has of God. For every soul, seeing Him in her own way, doubtless communicates that unique vision to all the rest. That, says an old author, is why the Seraphim in Isaiah\'s vision are crying \\"Holy, Holy, Holy\\" tO OTIC another (Isaiah VI, 3). The more we thus share the Heavenly Bread between US the more we shall all have.","At his present stage, you see, he has an idea of \u2018Christians\u2019 in his mind which he supposes to be spiritual but which, in fact, is largely pictorial.","The fountain that sprang with mingled blood and life in the Dark World, flows here with life only. We have passed the first cataracts, and from here onward the stream flows deep and turns in the direction of the sea. This is the Morning Star which He promised to those who conquer; this is the center of worlds. Till now, all has waited. But now the trumpet has sounded and the army is on the move. Blessed be He!","But the moment of his consent almost escaped his notice; certainly, there was no struggle, no sense of turning a corner.","There was a nice brown egg, lightly boiled, for each of them, and then sardines on toast, and then buttered toast, and then toast with honey, and then a sugar-topped cake. And when Lucy was tired of eating, the Faun began to talk. He had wonderful tales to tell of life in the forest. He told about the midnight dances and how the Nymphs who lived in the wells and the Dryads who lived in the trees came out to dance with the Fauns; about long hunting parties after the milk-white stag who could give you wishes if you caught him; about feasting and treasure-seeking with the wild Red Dwarfs in deep mines and caverns far beneath the forest floor; and then about summer when the woods were green and old Silenus on his fat donkey would come to visit them, and sometimes Bacchus himself, and then the streams would run with wine instead of water and the whole forest would give itself up to jollification for weeks on end.","Nothing matters at all except the tendency of a given state of mind, in given circumstances, to move a particular patient at a particular moment nearer to the Enemy or nearer to us.","God\u2019s love for man and man\u2019s love for God. About the second of these two, people are often worried. They are told they ought to love God. They cannot find any such feeling in themselves. What are they to do? The answer is the same as before. Act as if you did. Do not sit trying to manufacture feelings. Ask yourself, \u2018If I were sure that I loved God, what would I do?\u2019 When you have found the answer, go and do it.","Virtue\u2014even attempted virtue\u2014brings light; indulgence brings fog.","In every department of life it marks the transition from dreaming aspiration to laborious doing.","My argument against God was that the universe seemed so cruel and unjust. But how had I got this idea of just and unjust? A man does not call a line crooked unless he has some idea of a straight line. What was I comparing this universe with when I called it unjust? If the whole show was bad and senseless from A to Z, so to speak, why did I, who was supposed to be part of the show, find myself in such violent reaction against it? A man feels wet when he falls into water, because man is not a water animal: a fish would not feel wet. Of course I could have given up my idea of justice by saying it was nothing but a private idea of my own. But if I did that, then my argument against God collapsed too\u2014for the argument depended on saying that the world was really unjust, not simply that it did not happen to please my fancies. Thus in the very act of trying to prove that God did not exist\u2014in other words, that the whole of reality was senseless\u2014I found I was forced to assume that one part of reality\u2014namely my idea of justice\u2014was full of sense. Consequently atheism turns out to be too simple. If the whole universe has no meaning, we should never have found out that it has no meaning: just as, if there were no light in the universe and therefore no creatures with eyes, we should never know it was dark. Dark would be a word without meaning.","When your sword breaks, you draw your dagger.","Our cause is never more in danger than when a human, no longer desiring, but still intending, to do our Enemy\u2019s will, looks round upon a universe from which every trace of Him seems to have vanished, and asks why he has been forsaken, and still obeys. But","On the other hand, if God\'s moral judgement differs from ours so that our \'black\' may be His \'white\', we can mean nothing by calling Him good; for to say \'God is good\', while asserting that His goodness is wholly other than ours, is really only to say \'God is we know not what\'. And an utterly unknown quality in God cannot give us moral grounds for loving or obeying Him. If He is not (in our sense) \'good\' we shall obey, if at all, only through fear - and should be equally ready to obey omnipotent Fiend. The doctrine of Total Depravity - when the consequence is drawn that, since we are totally depraved, our idea of good is worth simply nothing - may thus turn Christianity into a form of devil-worship.- The Problem of Pain, pp. 28 - 29","They will not apply themselves steadily to worldly advancement, prudent connections, and the policy of safety first. So inveterate is their appetite for Heaven that our best method, at this stage, of attaching them to earth is to make them believe that earth can be turned into Heaven at some future date by politics or eugenics or \u2018science\u2019 or psychology, or what not.","I have great hopes that we shall learn in due time how to emotionalise and mythologise their science to such an extent that what is, in effect, a belief in us (though not under that name) will creep in while the human mind remains closed to belief in the Enemy.","things everlastingly emerge, stilly and tranquilly, into space and time.","Debes haberte preguntado muchas veces por qu\xe9 el Enemigo no hace m\xe1s uso de Sus poderes para hacerse sensiblemente presente a las almas humanas.

Having once got this misconception well fixed in his head, you may then proceed in various ways.","Even a walk will get us somewhere sometime.","Very often, however, this silly procedure is adopted by people who are not silly, but who, consciously or unconsciously, want to destroy Christianity. Such people put up a version of Christianity suitable for a child of six and make that the object of their attack.","Of course there is no conceivable way of getting by reason from the proposition \u2018I am losing interest in this\u2019 to the proposition \u2018This is false\u2019. But, as I said before, it is jargon, not reason, you must rely on.","Weakness, and work, are two comforts the gods have not taken from us. I\u2019d not write it (it might move them to take these also away) except that they must know it already. I was too weak now to feel much grief or anger. These days, before my strength came back, were almost happy.","He sees as well as you do that courage is not simply one of the virtues, but the form of every virtue at the testing point, which means, at the point of highest reality. A chastity or honesty, or mercy, which yields to danger will be chaste or honest or merciful only on conditions. Pilate was merciful till it became risky.","It is one of the evils of rapid diffusion of news that the sorrows of all the world come to us every morning. I think each village was meant to feel pity for it\u2019s own sick and poor whom it can help and I doubt if it is the duty of any private person to fix his mind on ills which he cannot help. (This may even become an escape from the works of charity we really can do to those we know). A great many people do now seem think that the mere state of being worried is in itself meritorious. I don\u2019t think it is. We must, if it so happens, give our lives for others: but even while we\u2019re doing it, I think we\u2019re meant to enjoy Our Lord and, in Him, our friends, our food, our sleep, your jokes, and the birds song and the frosty sunrise.","The idea that human beings should exercise their vocal organs for any purpose except that of communicating or discovering truth was to him preposterous.","It is a mistake to think that Christians ought all to be teetotallers; Of course it may be the duty of a particular Christian, or of any Christian, at a particular time, to abstain from strong drink, either because he is the sort of man who cannot drink at all without drinking too much, or because he wants to give the money to the poor, or because he is with people who are inclined to drunkenness and must not encourage them by drinking himself. But the whole point is that he is abstaining, for a good reason, from something which he does not condemn and which he likes to see other people enjoying. One of the marks of a certain type of bad man is that he cannot give up a thing himself without wanting everyone else to give it up. That is not the Christian way. An individual Christian may see fit to give up all sorts of things for special reasons\u2014marriage, or meat, or beer, or the cinema; but the moment he starts saying the things are bad in themselves, or looking down his nose at other people who do use them, he has taken the wrong turning.One great piece of mischief has been done by the modern restriction of the word Temperance to the question of drink. It helps people to forget that you can be just as intemperate about lots of other things. A man who makes his golf or his motor-bicycle the centre of his life, or a woman who devotes all her thoughts to clothes or bridge or her dog, is being just as \\"intemperate\\" as someone who gets drunk every evening. Of course, it does not show on the outside so easily: bridge-mania or golf-mania do not make you fall down in the middle of the road. But God is not deceived by externals.","You will not find the warrior, the poet, the philosopher, or the Christian by staring into his eyes as if he were your mistress: better fight beside him, read with him, argue with him, pray with him.","I may repeat \u2018Do as you would be done by\u2019 till I am black in the face, but I cannot really carry it out till I love my neighbour as myself: and I cannot learn to love my neighbour as myself till I learn to love God: and I cannot learn to love God except by learning to obey Him. And so, as I warned you, we are driven on to something more inward\u2014driven on from social matters to religious matters. For the longest way round is the shortest way home.","The natural life in each of us is something self-centred, something that wants to be petted and admired, to take advantage of other lives, to exploit the whole universe. And especially it wants to be left to itself: to keep well away from anything better or stronger or higher than it, anything that might make it feel small. It is afraid of the light and air of the spiritual world, just as people who have been brought up to be dirty are afraid of a bath. And in a sense it is quite right. It knows that if the spiritual life gets hold of it, all its self-centredness and self-will are going to be killed and it is ready to fight tooth and nail to avoid that. Did","the Christian thinks any good he does comes from the Christ-life inside him. He does not think God will love us because we are good, but that God will make us good because He loves us; just as the roof of a greenhouse does not attract the sun because it is bright, but becomes bright because the sun shines on it.","Wouldn\u2019t it be dreadful if some day in our own world, at home, men started going wild inside, like the animals here, and still looked like men, so that you\u2019d never know which were which?","When she had first crossed the dry and dusty world which his mind inhabited she had been like a spring shower; in opening himself to it he had not been mistaken. He had gone wrong only in assuming that marriage, by itself, gave him either power or title to appropriate that freshness. As he now saw, one might as well have thought one could buy a sunset by buying the field from which one had seen it.","Grown-up, indeed, said the Lady Polly. \u201cI wish she would grow up. She wasted all her school time wanting to be the age she is now, and she\u2019ll waste all the rest of her life trying to stay that age. Her\u201d","the French Revolution would have taught them that the behaviour aristocrats naturally like is not the behaviour that preserves aristocracy","los cristianos piensan que cualquier bien que hagan proviene de la vida de Cristo en su interior. No creen que Dios nos amar\xe1 porque seamos buenos, sino que Dios nos har\xe1 buenos porque nos ama, del mismo modo que el tejado de un invernadero no atrae el sol porque es brillante, sino que se vuelve brillante porque el sol brilla sobre \xe9l.","Bring fully into the consciousness of your patient that particular lift of his mother\u2019s eyebrows which he learned to dislike in the nursery, and let him think how much he dislikes it.","Every Christian would agree that a man\u2019s spiritual health is exactly proportional to his love for God. But man\u2019s love for God, from the very nature of the case, must always be very largely, and must often be entirely, a Need-love. This is obvious when we implore forgiveness for our sins or support in our tribulations. But in the long run it is perhaps even more apparent in our growing\u2014for it ought to be growing\u2014awareness that our whole being by its very nature is one vast need; incomplete, preparatory, empty yet cluttered, crying out for Him who can untie things that are now knotted together and tie up things that are still dangling loose.","Damsel,\\" said the Prince, bowing to her. \\"You are of a high courage, and therefore, I doubt not, you come of a noble blood in your own world."]')}}]);
