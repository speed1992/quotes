I was one who seeks, and I still am, but I no longer seek in the stars or in books; I\'m beginning to hear the teachings of my blood pulsing within me. My story isn\'t pleasant, it\'s not sweet and harmonious like the invented stories; it tastes of folly and bewilderment, of madness and dream, like the life of all people who no longer want to lie to themselves.","Some of us think holding on makes us strong; but sometimes it is letting go.","Whoever wants music instead of noise, joy instead of pleasure, soul instead of gold, creative work instead of business, passion instead of foolery, finds no home in this trivial world of ours.","I have always believed, and I still believe, that whatever good or bad fortune may come our way we can always give it meaning and transform it into something of value.","The true profession of a man is to find his way to himself.","To achieve the possible, we must attempt the impossible again and again.","There is no reality except the one contained within us. That is why so many people live such an unreal life. They take the images outside them for reality and never allow the world within to assert itself.","Every experience has its element of magic.","When you like someone, you like them in spite of their faults. When you love someone, you love them with their faults.","Learn what is to be taken seriously and laugh at the rest.","To hold our tongues when everyone is gossiping, to smile without hostility at people and institutions, to compensate for the shortage of love in the world with more love in small, private matters; to be more faithful in our work, to show greater patience, to forgo the cheap revenge obtainable from mockery and criticism: all these are things we can do.","We kill at every step, not only in wars, riots and executions. We kill when we close our eyes to poverty, suffering and shame.In the same way all disrespect for life, all hard-heartedness,all indifference, all contempt is nothing else than killing.","Love your suffering. Do not resist it, do not flee from it. It is only your aversion to it that hurts, nothing else.","Because the world is so full of death and horror, I try again and again to console my heart and pick the flowers that grow in the midst of hell.","The deity is within you, not in ideas and books. Truth is lived, not taught.","Happiness is love, nothing else. A man who is capable of love is happy.","Wisdom is nothing but a preparation of the soul, a capacity, a secret art of thinking, feeling and breathing thoughts of unity at every moment of life.","A tree says: \\n My strength is trust. \\n I know nothing about my fathers, I know nothing about the thousand children that every year spring out of me. \\n I live out the secret of my seed to the very end, and I care for nothing else. \\n I trust that God is in me. \\n I trust that my labor is holy. Out of this trust I live.","Any attempt to replace a personal conscience by a collective conscience does violence to the individual and is the first step toward totalitarianism.","Life is waiting everywhere, the future is flowering everywhere, but we only see a small part of it and step on much of it with our feet","The truth has a million faces, but there is only one truth.","You are only afraid if you are not in harmony with yourself. People are afraid because they have never owned up to themselves.","The truth is lived, not taught.","If you hate a person, you hate something in him that is part of yourself. What isn\'t part of ourselves doesn\'t disturb us.","A tree has something to say to us: Be still! Be still! Look at me!... Home is within you, or home is nowhere at all.","Knowledge can be communicated, but not wisdom. One can find it, live it, be fortified by it, do wonders through it, but one cannot communicate and teach it.","I live in my dreams \u2014 that\'s what you sense. Other people live in dreams, but not in their own. That\'s the difference.","God does not send us despair in order to kill us; he sends it in order to awaken us to new life.","People with courage and character always seem sinister to the rest.","Beauty does not bring happiness to the one who possesses it, but to the one who loves and admires it.","The man of power is ruined by power, the man of money by money, the submissive man by subservience, the pleasure seeker by pleasure.","A home isn\'t just a roof over our heads. A home is a place where we feel loved and where we love others. It\'s a place we belong. Love is what makes a home, not the contents inside the house or the number on the door. It\'s the people waiting for us across the threshold, the people who will take us in their arms after a ad day and kiss us good night and good morning everyday for the rest of our lives.","Every phenomenon on earth is symbolic, and each symbol is an open gate through which the soul, if it is ready, can enter into the inner part of the world, where you and I and day and night are all one.","Have you also learned that secret from the river; that there is no such thing as time?\\" That the river is everywhere at the same time, at the source and at the mouth, at the waterfall, at the ferry, at the current, in the ocean and in the mountains, everywhere and that the present only exists for it, not the shadow of the past nor the shadow of the future.","Happiness is a how; not a what. A talent, not an object.","All the books of the world full of thoughts and poems are nothing in comparison to a minute of sobbing, when feeling surges in waves, the soul feels itself profoundly and finds itself. Tears are the melting ice of snow. All angels are close to the crying person.","Loneliness is the way by which destiny endeavors to lead man to himself.","I began to understand that suffering and disappointments and melancholy are there not to vex us or cheapen us or deprive us of our dignity but to mature and transfigure us.",". . . gentleness is stronger than severity, water is stronger than rock, love is stronger than force.","You know quite well, deep within you, that there is only a single magic, a single power, a single salvation...and that is called loving. Well, then, love your suffering. Do not resist it, do not flee from it. It is your aversion that hurts, nothing else.","You have to try the impossible to achieve the possible","Only within yourself exists that other reality for which you long.","What I am in search of is not so much the gratification of a curiosity or a passion for worldly life, but something far less conditional. I do not wish to go out into the world with an insurance policy in my pocket guaranteeing my return in the event of a disappointment, like some cautious traveller who would be content with a brief glimpse of the world. On the contrary, I desire that there should be hazards, difficulties and dangers to face; I am hungry for reality, for tasks and deeds, and also for privation and suffering.","You say yes to the sunlight and pure fantasies, so you have to say yes to the filth and the nausea. Everything is within you, gold and mud, happiness and pain, the laughter of childhood and the apprehension of death. Say yes to everything, shirk nothing.","I do not consider myself less ignorant than most people. I have been and still am a seeker, but I have ceased to question stars and books. I have begun to listen to the teachings my blood whispers to me. My story is not a pleasant one; it is neither sweet nor harmonious, as invented stories are; it has the taste of nonsense and chaos, of madness and dreams -- like the lives of all men who stop deceiving themselves.","You must find your dream, then the way becomes easy.","You can ride, you can travel with a friend of your own;\\nThe final step you must take alone.\\nNo wisdom is better than this when known:\\nThat every hard thing is done alone.","madness, in a higher sense, is the beginning of all wisdom","A man who is ill-adjusted to the world is always on the verge of finding himself. One who is adjusted to the world never finds himself, but gets to be a cabinet minister.","When the suffering becomes acute enough, one goes forward.","Love must neither beg nor demand.  Love must be strong enough to find certainty within itself.  It then cease to be moved and becomes the mover.","All life was a breath exhaled by God. All dying was a breath inhaled by God.","The sacred sense of beyond, of timelessness, of a world which had an eternal value and the substance of which was divine had been given back to me today by this friend of mine who taught me dancing.","Chaos demands to be recognized and experienced before letting itself be converted into a new order.","This day will never come again and anyone who fails to eat and drink and taste and smell it will never have it offered to him again in all eternity. The sun will never shine as it does today...But you must play your part and sing a song, one of your best.","If time is not real, then the dividing line between this world and eternity, between suffering and bliss, between good and evil, is also an illusion.","Youth ends when egotism does; maturity begins when one lives for others.","The world was so beautiful when regarded like this, without searching, so simply, in such a childlike way. Moons and stas were beautiful, beautiful were bank and stream, forest and rocks, goat and gold-bug, flower and butterfly. So lovely, so delightful to go through the world this way, so like a child, awake, open to what is near, without distrust.","There is no reality except the one contained within us.","Slowly blossomed, slowly ripened in Siddhartha the realisation, the knowledge, what wisdom actually was, what the goal of his long search was. It was nothing but a readiness of the soul, an ability, a secret art, to think every moment, while living his life, the thought of oneness, to be able to feel and inhale the oneness.","Most people...are like a falling leaf that drifts and turns in the air, flutters, and falls to the ground. But a few others are like stars which travel one defined path: no wind reaches them, they have within themselves their guide and path.","We must become so alone, so utterly alone, that we withdraw into our innermost self. It is a way of bitter suffering. But then our solitude is overcome, we are no longer alone, for we find that our innermost self is the spirit, that it is God, the indivisible. And suddenly we find ourselves in the midst of the world, yet undisturbed by its multiplicity, for our innermost soul we know ourselves to be one with all being.","Art is the contemplation of the world in a state of grace.","You are only afriad if you are not in harmony with yourself. People are afraid because they have never owned up to themselves. A whole society composed of men afraid of the unknown within them!","If I know what love is, it is because of you.","One never reaches home, but wherever friendly paths intersect the whole world looks like home for a time.","We fear death, we shudder at life\'s instability, we grieve to see the flowers wilt again and again, and the leaves fall, and in our hearts we know that we, too, are transitory and will soon disappear. When artists create pictures and thinkers search for laws and formulate thoughts, it is in order to salvage something from the great dance of death, to make something last longer than we do.","I have been and still am a seeker, but I have ceased to question stars and books; I have begun to listen to the teaching my blood whispers to me.","No permanence is ours, we are a wave that flows to fit whatever form it finds.","For me, trees have always been the most penetrating preachers.","My goal is this: always to put myself in the place in which I am best able to serve, wherever my gifts and qualities find the best soil to grow, the widest field of action. There is no other goal.","Theory is knowledge that doesn\'t work. Practice is when everything works and you don\'t know why.","Solitude is independence.","Faith and doubt go hand in hand, they are complementaries. One who never doubts will never truly believe.","A house without books is a poor house, even if beautiful rugs are covering its floors and precious wallpapers and pictures cover its walls","Those who cannot think or take responsibility for themselves need, and clamor for, a leader.","When someone is seeking, it happens quite easily that he only sees the thing that he is seeking; that he is unable to find anything, unable to absorb anything, because he is only thinking of the thing he is seeking, because he has a goal, because he is obsessed with his goal. Seeking means: to have a goal; but finding means: to be free, to be receptive, to have no goal. You, O worthy one, are perhaps indeed a seeker, for in striving towards your goal, you do not see many things that are under your nose.","We have to stumble through so much dirt and humbug before we reach home. And we have no one to guide us. Our only guide is our homesickness.","Age is a state of mind. Youth and age exist only among the ordinary people. All the more talented and exceptional of us; are sometimes old, just as we are sometimes happy, and sometimes sad.","Never is a man wholly a saint or a sinner.","Each man had only one genuine vocation - to find the way to himself....His task was to discover his own destiny - not an arbitrary one - and to live it out wholly and resolutely within himself. Everything else was only a would-be existence, an attempt at evasion, a flight back to the ideals of the masses, conformity and fear of one\'s own inwardness.","I have had to experience so much stupidity, so many vices, so much error, so much nausea, disillusionment and sorrow, just in order to become a child again and begin anew. I had to experience despair, I had to sink to the greatest mental depths, to thoughts of suicide, in order to experience grace.","Seeking means: to have a goal; but finding means: to be free, to be receptive, to have no goal.","I have begun to listen to the teachings my blood whispers to me.","My real self wanders elsewhere, far away, wanders on and on invisibly and has nothing to do with my life.","Seriousness is an accident of time. It consists of putting too high a value on time. In eternity there is no time. Eternity is a moment, just long enough for a joke","All higher humor begins with ceasing to take oneself seriously.","Man\'s life seems to me like a long, weary night that would be intolerable if there were not occasionally flashes of light, the sudden brightness of which is so comforting and wonderful, that the moments of their appearance cancel out and justify the years of darkness.","What could I say to you that would be of value, except that perhaps you seek too much, that as a result of your seeking you cannot find.","For me, trees have always been the most penetrating preachers. I revere them when they live in tribes and families, in forests and groves. And even more I revere them when they stand alone. They are like lonely persons. Not like hermits who have stolen away out of some weakness, but like great, solitary men, like Beethoven and Nietzsche.","And all the voices, all the goals, all the yearnings, all the sorrows, all the pleasures, all the good and evil, all of them together was the world. All of them together was the stream of events, the music of life.","The bourgeois prefers comfort to pleasure, convenience to liberty, and a pleasant temperature to the deathly inner consuming fire.","All I really wanted was to try and live the life that was spontaneously welling up within me. Why was that so very difficult?","She stood before him and surrendered herself to him and sky, forest, and brook all came toward him in new and resplendent colors, belonged to him, and spoke to him in his own language. And instead of merely winning a woman he embraced the entire world and every star in heaven glowed within him and sparkled with joy in his soul. He had loved and had found himself. But most people love to lose themselves.","Your soul is the whole world.","Within us there is someone who knows everything, wills everything, does everything better than we ourselves.","When dealing with the insane, the best method is to pretend to be sane.","The river has taught me to listen; you will learn from it, too. The river knows everything; one can learn everything from it. You have already learned from the river that it is good to strive downwards, to sink, to seek the depths.","Trees are sanctuaries. Whoever knows how to speak to them, whoever knows how to listen to them, can learn the truth. They do not preach learning and precepts, they preach, undeterred by particulars, the ancient law of life.","But of all the water\'s secrets, he saw today only a single one-one that struck his soul. He saw that this water flowed and flowed, it was constantly flowing, and yet it was always there; it was always eternally the same and yet new at every moment! Oh, to be able to grasp this, to understand this!","It is not for me to judge another man\'s life. I must judge, I must choose, I must spurn, purely for myself. For myself, alone.","The best weapons against the infamies of life are courage, wilfulness and patience. Courage strenthens, wilfulness is fun and patience provides tranquility.","A magic dwells in each beginning, protecting us, telling us how to live.","What we can and should change is ourselves: our impatience, our egoism (including intellectual egoism), our sense of injury, our lack of love and forbearance. I regard every other attempt to change the world, even if it springs from the best intentions, as futile.","And some day there will be nothing left of everything that has twisted my life and grieved it and filled me so often with such anguish. Some day, with the last exhaustion, peace will come and the motherly earth will gather me back home. It won\'t be the end of things, only a way of being born again, a bathing and a slumbering where the old and the withered sink down, where the young and new begin to breathe. Then, with other thoughts, I will walk along streets like these, and listen to streams, and overhear what the sky says in the evening, over and over and over.","Each man\'s life represents a road toward himself.","Every man is more than just himself; he also represents the unique, the very special and always significant and remarkable point at which the world\'s phenomena intersect, only once in this way, and never again.","The world is not imperfect or slowly evolving along a long path to perfection. No, it is perfect at every moment; every sin already carries grace within it, all small children are potential old men, all sucklings have death within them, all dying people \u2014 eternal life.","I believe that I am not responsible for the meaningfulness or meaninglessness of life, but that I am responsible for what I do with the life I\'ve got.","Not in his speech, not in his thoughts, I see his greatness, only in his actions, in his life.","The only reality is the one we have inside us. What makes most people\u2019s lives so artificial and unworthy is that they falsely regard outside images as reality and they never allow their own inner world to speak.","What you call passion is not spiritual force, but friction between the soul and the outside world.","What he had not learned, however, was this: to find contentment in himself and his own life","As a body everyone is single, as a soul never.","Opinions mean nothing; they may be beautiful or ugly, clever or foolish, anyone can embrace or reject them.","our friendship has no other purpose, no other reason, than to show you how utterly unlike me you are.","When trying to remember my share in the glow of the eternal present, in the smile of God, I return to my childhood, too, for that is where the most significant discoveries turn up.","We kill when we close our eyes to poverty, affliction, or infamy. We kill when, because it is easier, we countenance, or pretend to approve of atrophied social, political, educational, and religious institutions, instead of resolutely combating them.","I realize today that nothing in the world is more distasteful to a man than to take the path that leads to himself.","Only the ideas that we really live have any value.","He had loved and he had found himself. Most people love to lose themselves.","Each man\'s life represents a road toward himself, an attempt at such a road, the intimation of a path... But each of us - experiments of the depths - strives toward his own destiny. We can understand one another; but each of us is able to interpret himself to himself alone.","It taught him how to listen -- how to listen with a quiet heart and a waiting soul, open soul, without passion, without desire, without judgment, without opinion.","A longing to wander tears my heart when I hear trees rustling in the wind at evening...","Oh, love isn\'t there to make us happy. I believe it exists to show us how much we can endure.","For what I always hated and detested and cursed above all things was this contentment, this healthiness and comfort, this carefully preserved optimism of the middle classes, this fat and prosperous brood of mediocrity.","What should I possibly have to tell you, oh venerable one? Perhaps that you\'re searching far too much? That in all that searching, you don\'t find the time for finding?","Meaning and reality were not hidden somewhere behind things, they were in them, in all of them.","There was once a man, Harry, called the steppenwolf. He went on two legs, wore clothes and was a human being, but nevertheless he was in reality a wolf of the steppes. He had learned a good deal of all that people of a good intelligence can, and was a fairly clever fellow. What he had not learned, however, was this: to find contentment in himself and his own life.","You are willing to die, you coward, but not to live.","There is truth, my boy. But the doctrine you desire, absolute, perfect dogma that alone provides wisdom, does not exist. Nor should you long for a perfect doctrine, my friend. Rather, you should long for the perfection of yourself. The deity is within you, not in ideas and books. Truth is lived, not taught.","Those who are too lazy and comfortable to think for themselves and be their own judges obey the laws. Others sense their own laws within them.","Passion is always a mystery and unaccountable, and unfortunately there is no doubt that life does not spare its purest children; often it is just the most deserving people who cannot help loving those that destroy them.","The greatest threat to our world and its peace comes from those who want war, who prepare for it, and who, by holding out vague promises of future peace or by instilling fear of foreign aggression, try to make us accomplices to their plans.","We are not going in circles, we are going upwards. The path is a spiral; we have already climbed many steps.","Making music together is the best way for two people to become friends.","Everything becomes a little different as soon as it is spoken out loud.","Without words, without writing and without books there would be no history, there could be no concept of humanity.","I wanted only to live in accord with the promptings which came from my true self. Why was that so very difficult?","Every age, every culture, every custom and tradition has its own character, its own weakness and its own strength, its beauties and cruelties; it accepts certain sufferings as matters of course, puts up patiently with certain evils. Human life is reduced to real suffering, to hell, only when two ages, two cultures and religions overlap","Om is the bow, the arrow is soul.","At the first kiss I felt something melt inside me that hurt in an exquisite way. All my longings, all my dreams and sweet anguish, all the secrets that slept deep within me came awake, everything was transformed and enchanted, and everything made sense.","Let me say no more. Words do no justice to the hidden meaning. Everything immediately becomes slightly different when it is expressed in words, a little bit distorted, a little foolish...It is perfectly fine with me that what for one man is precious wisdom for another sounds like foolery.","How beautiful the world was when one looked at it, without searching... just looked, simply and innocently.","Gaze into the fire, into the clouds, and as soon as the inner voices begin to speak... surrender to them. Don\'t ask first whether it\'s permitted, or would please your teachers or father or some god. You will ruin yourself if you do that.","It is not our purpose to become each other; it is to recognize each other, to learn to see the other and honor him for what he is: each the other\'s opposite and complement.","To die is to go into the Collective Unconscious, to lose oneself in order to be transformed into form, pure form.","At one time I had given much thought to why men were so very rarely capable of living for an ideal. Now I saw that many, no, all men were capable of dying for one.","The bird fights its way out of the egg. The egg is the world. Who would be born must first destroy a world. The bird flies to God. The God\'s name is Abraxas.","I suddenly saw how sad and artificial my life had been during this period, for the loves, friends, habits and pleasures of these years were discarded like badly fitting clothes. I parted from them without pain and all that remained was to wonder that I could have endured them so long.","His life oscillates, as everyone\'s does, not merely between two poles, such as the body and the spirit, the saint and the sinner, but between thousands and thousands.","Every politician in the world is all for revolution, reason, and disarmament-but only in enemy countries, not in his own.","He was taught by the river. Incessantly, he learned from it. Most of all, he learned from it to listen, to pay close attention with a quiet heart, with a waiting, opened soul, without passion, without a wish, without judgement, without an opinion.","Thus Gotama [Buddha] walked toward the town to gather alms, and the two samanas recognized him solely by the perfection of his repose, by the calmness of his figure, in which there was no trace of seeking, desiring, imitating, or striving, only light and peace","Writing is good, thinking is better. Cleverness is good, patience is better.","What is meditation?... It is fleeing from the self, it is a short escape of the agony of being a self, it is a short numbing of the senses against the pain and the pointlessness of life. The same escape, the same short numbing is what the driver of an ox-cart finds in the inn, drinking a few bowls of rice wine or fermented coconut-milk.","In every truth, the opposite is equally true. For example, a truth can only be expressed and enveloped in words if it is onesided.","Words can not express the joy of new life.","When we hate a person, what we hate in his image is something inside ourselves. Whatever isn\'t inside us can\'t excite us.","An enlightened man had but one duty - to seek the way to himself, to reach inner certainty, to grope his way forward, no matter where it led.","I hope death will be a great happiness, a happiness as great as that of love, fulfilled love","I cannot tell my story without reaching a long way back.","It may be important to great thinkers to examine the world, to explain and despise it. But I think it is only important to love the world, not to despise it, not for us to hate each other, but to be able to regard the world and ourselves and all beings with love, admiration and respect.","Were not the gods forms created like me and you, mortal, transient?","The call of death is a call of love. Death can be sweet if we answer it in the affirmative, if we accept it as one of the great eternal forms of life and transformation.","The highest art... sets down its creations and trusts in their magic, without fear of not being understood.","The world, Govinda my friend, is not imperfect, not to be seen as on a slow path toward perfection: No, it is perfect in every moment, all transgression already bears grace within itself, all little children already have the aged in themselves, all the sucklings death, all the dying eternal life.","Lovers should not separate from each other after making love without admiring each other, without being conquered as well as conquering, so that no feeling of satiation or desolation arises nor the horrid feeling of misusing or having been misused.","Often it is the most deserving people who cannot help loving those who destroy them.","The river is everywhere.","Nothing was, nothing will be, everything has reality and presence","Happiness is love, nothing else.","All birth means separation from the All, the confinement within limitation, the separation from God, the pangs of being born ever anew. The return into the All, the dissolution of painful individuation, the reunion with God means the expansion of the soul until it is able once more to embrace the All.","Every path leads homeward, every step is birth, every step is death, every grave is mother.","That\'s the way it is when you love. It makes you suffer, and I have suffered much in the years since. But it matters little that you suffer, so long as you feel alive with a sense of the close bond that connects all living things, so long as love does not die!","Whether it is good or evil, whether life in itself is pain or pleasure, whether it is uncertain-that it may perhaps be this is not important-but the unity of the world, the coherence of all events, the embracing of the big and the small from the same stream, from the same law of cause, of becoming and dying.","Sentimentality is a basking in feelings that in reality you don\'t take seriously enough to make the slightest sacrifice to or ever translate into action.","He saw mankind going through life in a childlike manner... which he loved but also despised.... He saw them toiling, saw them suffering, and becoming gray for the sake of things which seemed to him to be entirely unworthy of this price, for money, for little pleasures, for being slightly honoured.","Despair is the result of each earnest attempt to go through life with virtue, justice and understanding, and to fulfill their requirements. Children live on one side of despair, the awakened on the other side.","One must find the source within one\'s own Self, one must possess it. Everything else was seeking -- a detour, an error.","Each man had only one genuine vocation to find the way to himself.","But it\'s a poor fellow who can\'t take his pleasure without asking other people\'s permission.","There are always a few such people who demand the utmost of life and yet cannot come to terms with its stupidity and crudeness.","Each man\'s life represents a road toward himself, an attempt at such a road, the intimation of a path. No man has ever been entirely and completely himself.","Look: We hate nothing that exists, not even death, suffering and dying, does not horrify our souls, as long as we learn more deeply to love.","Wisdom cannot be imparted. Wisdom that a wise man attempts to impart always sounds like foolishness to someone else.","The opposite of every truth is just as true.","Our mind is capable of passing beyond the dividing line we have drawn for it. Beyond the pairs of opposites of which the world consists, other, new insights begin.","The voices of all creatures are in the voices of the river.","So she thoroughly taught him that one cannot take pleasure without giving pleasure, and that every gesture, every caress, every touch, every glance, every last bit of the body has its secret, which brings happiness to the person who knows how to wake it. She taught him that after a celebration of love the lovers should not part without admiring each other, without being conquered or having conquered, so that neither is bleak or glutted or has the bad feeling of being used or misused.","Everyone can perform magic, everyone can reach his goals, if he is able to think, if he is able to wait, if he is able to fast.","Everything that is thought and expressed in words is one-sided, only half the truth; it all lacks totality, completeness, unity. When the Illustrious Buddha taught about the world, he had to divide it into Samsara and Nirvana, illusion and truth, into suffering and salvation. One cannot do otherwise, there is no other method for those who teach. But the world itself, being in and around us, is never one-sided. Never is a man or a deed wholly Samsara or wholly Nirvana; never is a man wholly a saint or a sinner. This only seems so because we suffer the illusion that time is something real.","The art of love-giving and taking become one.","A wild longing for strong emotions and sensations seethes in me, a rage against this toneless, flat, normal and sterile life. I have a mad impulse to smash something, a warehouse perhaps, or a cathedral, or myself, to committ outrages.","If a man has nothing to eat, fasting is the most intelligent thing he can do.","During deep meditation it is possible to dispel time, to see simultaneously all the past, present, and future, and then everything is good, everything is perfect, everything is Brahman.","Love of God is not always the same as love of good.","Was it not his Self, his small, fearful and proud Self, with which he had wrestled for so many years, but which had always conquered him again, which appeared each time again and again, which robbed him of happiness and filled him with fear?","When we are stricken and cannot bear our lives any longer, then a tree has something to say to us: Be still! Be still! Look at me! Life is not easy, life is not difficult. Those are childish thoughts. . . . Home is neither here nor there. Home is within you, or home is nowhere at all.","It was morning; through the high window I saw the pure, bright blue of the sky as it hovered cheerfully over the long roofs of the neighboring houses. It too seemed full of joy, as if it had special plans, and had put on its finest clothes for the occasion.","Good that you ask. You should always ask, always have doubts.","For mountain and stream, tree and leaf, root and blossom, every form in nature is echoed in us and originates in the soul whose being is eternity and is hidden from us but none the less gives itself to us for the most part in the power of love and creation.","I, also, would like to look and smile, sit and walk like that, so free, so worthy, so restrained, so candid, so childlike and mysterious. A man only looks and walks like that when he has conquered his Self. I also will conquer my Self.","Things are going downhill with you!\' he said to himself, and laughed about it, and as he was saying it, he happened to glance at the river, and he also saw the river going downhill, always moving on downhill, and singing and being happy through it all.","Man is not by any means of fixed and enduring form (this, in spite of suspicions to the contrary on the part of their wise men, was the ideal of the ancients). He is nothing else than the narrow and perilous bridge between nature and spirit. His innermost destiny drives him on to the spirit and to God. His innermost longing draws him back to nature, the mother. Between the two forces his life hangs tremulous and irresolute.","Man designs for himself a garden with a hundred kinds of trees, a thousand kinds of flowers, a hundred kinds of fruit and vegetables. Suppose, then, that the gardener of this garden knew no other distinction between edible and inedible, nine-tenths of this garden would be useless to him. He would pull up the most enchanting flowers and hew down the noblest trees and even regard them with a loathing and envious eye. This is what the Steppenwolf does with the thousand flowers of his soul. What does not stand classified as either man or wolf he does not see at all.","I call that man awake who, with conscious knowledge and understanding, can perceive the deep unreasoning powers in his soul, his whole innermost strength, desire and weakness, and knows how to reckon with himself.","He lost his Self a thousand times and for days on end he dwelt in non-being. But although the paths took him away from Self, in the end they always led back to it. Although Siddhartha fled from the Self a thousand times, dwelt in nothing, dwelt in animal and stone, the return was inevitable; the hour was inevitable when he would again find himself in sunshine or in moonlight, in shadow or in rain, and was again Self and Siddhartha, again felt the torment of the onerous life cycle.","A mere nothing suffices \u2014 and the lightning strikes.","Rain Soft rain, summer rain Whispers from bushes, whispers from trees. Oh, how lovely and full of blessing To dream and be satisfied. I was so long in the outer brightness, I am not used to this upheaval: Being at home in my own soul, Never to be led elsewhere. I want nothing, I long for nothing, I hum gently the sounds of childhood, And I reach home astounded In the warm beauty of dreams. Heart, how torn you are, How blessed to plow down blindly, To think nothing, to know nothing, Only to breathe, only to feel.","Like one who has eaten and drunk too much and vomits painfully and then feels better, so did the restless man wish he could rid himself with one terrific heave of these pleasures, of these habits of this entirely senseless life.","There is a miracle in every new beginning","Beautiful was this world, looking at it thus, without searching, thus simply, thus childlike.","a person is never entirely holy or entirely sinful.","He had thought more than other men, and in matters of the intellect he had that calm objectivity, that certainty of thought and knowledge, such as only really intellectual men have, who have no axe to grind, who never wish to shine, or to talk others down, or to appear always in the right.","...and gradually his face assumed the expressions which are so often found among rich people - the expressions of discontent, of sickliness, of displeasure, of idleness, of lovelessness. Slowly the soul sickness of the rich crept over him.","You must find your dream...but no dream lasts forever, each dream is followed by another, and one should not cling to any particular dream.","One can beg, buy, be presented with and find love in the streets, but it can never be stolen.","When someone seeks,\\" said Siddhartha, \\"then it easily happens that his eyes see only the thing that he seeks, and he is able to find nothing, to take in nothing because he always thinks only about the thing he is seeking, because he has one goal, because he is obsessed with his goal. Seeking means: having a goal. But finding means: being free, being open, having no goal.","Whither will my path yet lead me? This path is stupid, it goes in spirals, perhaps in circles, but whichever way it goes, I will follow it.","It is good to taste for yourself everything you need to know. That worldly pleasures and wealth are not good things, I learned even as a child. I knew it for a long time, but only now have I experienced it.","Whether you and I and a few others will renew the world some day remains to be seen. But within ourselves we must renew it each day.","I do want more. I am not content with being happy. I was not made for it. It is not my destiny. My destiny is the opposite.","For me, trees have always been the most penetrating preachers. I revere them when they live in tribes and families, in forests and groves.","Once you are able to make your request in such a way that you will be quite certain of its fulfillment, then the fulfillment will come.","Eternity is a mere moment, just long enough for a joke.","Faith is stronger than so-called reality.","I have always been a great dreamer; in dreams I am more active than in my real life, and these shadows sapped me of health and energy.","He has robbed me, yet he has given me something of greater value . . . he has given to me myself.","So you can\'t dance? Not at all? Not even one step? How can you say that you\'ve taken any trouble to live when you won\'t even dance?","She stood a moment before my eyes, clearly and painfully, loved and deeply woven into my destiny; then fell away again in a deep oblivion, at a half regretted distance.","I shall no longer be instructed by the Yoga Veda or the Aharva Veda, or the ascetics, or any other doctrine whatsoever. I shall learn from myself, be a pupil of myself; I shall get to know myself, the mystery of Siddhartha.\\" He looked around as if he were seeing the world for the first time.","One cannot apologize for something fundamental, and a child feels and knows this as well and as deeply as any sage.","Words do not express thoughts very well. They always become a little different immediately after they are expressed, a little distorted, a little foolish.","My resolve to die was not the whim of an hour. It was the ripe, sound fruit that had slowly grown to full size, lightly rocked by the winds of fate whose next breath would bring it to the ground.","How foolish to wear oneself out in vain longing for warmth! Solitude is independence.","The reason why I do not know anything about myself, the reason why Siddhartha has remained alien and unknown to myself is due to one thing, to one single thing--I was afraid of myself, I was fleeing from myself. I was seeking Atman, I was seeking Brahman, I was determined to dismember myself and tear away its layers of husk in order to find in its unknown innermost recess the kernel at the heart of those layers, the Atman, life, the divine principle, the ultimate. But in so doing, I was losing myself.","The tree does not die, it waits.","I am in truth the Steppenwolf that I often call myself; that beast astray that finds neither home nor joy nor nourishment in a world that is strange and incomprehensible to him.","We create gods and struggle with them, and they bless us.","Knowledge can communicated but not wisdom.","They both listened silently to the water, which to them was not just water, but the voice of life, the voice of Being, the voice of perpetual Becoming.","Perhaps people like us cannot love. Ordinary people can - that is their secret.","He saw that the water continually flowed and flowed and yet it was always there; it was always the same and yet every moment it was new.","Siddhartha stopped fighting his fate this very hour, and he stopped suffering.","I felt knowledge and the unity of the world circulate in me like my own blood.","Painting is marvelous; it makes you happier and more patient. Afterwards you do not have black fingers as with writing, but blue and red ones.","Every important cultural gesture comes down to a morality, a model for human behavior concentrated into a gesture.","Who travels far will often see things Far removed from what was believed as Truth.","If what matters in a person\'s existence is to accept the inevitable consciously, to taste the good and bad to the full and to make for oneself a more individual, unaccidental and inward\\n destiny alongside one\'s external fate, then my life has been neither empty nor worthless.","All interpretation, all psychology, all attempts to make things comprehensible, require the medium of theories, mythologies, and lies.","The diabolical thing about melancholy is not that it makes you ill but that it makes you conceited and shortsighted; yes almost arrogant. You lapse into bad taste, thinking of yourself as Heine\'s Atlas, whose shoulders support all the world\'s puzzles and agonies, as if thousands, lost in the same maze, did not endure the same agonies.","All suicides have the responsibility of fighting against the temptation of suicide. Every one of them knows very well in some corner of his soul that suicide, though a way out, is rather a mean and shabby one, and that it is nobler and finer to be conquered by life than to fall by one\'s own hand.","No, a true seeker, one who truly wished to find, could accept no doctrine. But the man who has found what he sought, such a man could approve of every doctrine, each and every one, every path, every goal; nothing separated him any longer from all those thousands of others who lived in the eternal, who breathed the Divine.","Each of us is merely one human being, merely an experiment, a way station. But each of us should be on the way toward perfection, should be striving to reach the center, not the periphery.","Human life is reduced to real suffering, to hell, only when two ages, two cultures and religions overlap.","Every man is more than just himself; he also represents the unique, the very special and always significant and remarkable point at which the world\'s phenomena intersect, only once in this way, and never again. That is why every man\'s story is important, eternal, sacred; that is why every man, as long as he lives and fulfills the will of nature, is wondrous, and worthy of consideration. In each individual the spirit has become flesh, in each man the creation suffers, within each one a redeemer is nailed to the cross.","Every sin already carries grace within in, all small children are potential old men, all sucklings have death within them, all dying people - eternal life.  The Buddha exists in the robber and dice player; the robber exists in the Brahmin.","I will no longer mutilate and destroy myself in order to find a secret behind the ruins.","You have no doubt guessed long since that the conquest of time and the escape from reality, or however else it may be that you choose to describe your longing, means simply the wish to be relieved of your so-called personality. That is the prison where you lie.","I have always thirsted for knowledge, I have always been full of questions.","Should we be mindful of dreams?\\" Joseph asked. \\"Can we interpret them?\\" The Master looked into his eyes and said tersely: \\"We should be mindful of everything, for we can interpret everything.","Love must not entreat,\' she added, \'or demand. Love must have the strength to become certain within itself. Then it ceases merely to be attracted and begins to attract.","Siddhartha has one single goal-to become empty, to become empty of thirst, desire, dreams, pleasure and sorrow-to let the Self die. No longer to be Self, to experience the peace of an emptied heart, to experience pure thought-that was his goal.","I want to learn from myself, want to be my student, want to get to know myself, the secret of Siddhartha.","...Every ego so far from being a unity is in the highest degree a manifold world, a constellated heaven, a chaos of forms, of states and stages, of inheritances and potentialities. It appears to be a necessity as imperative as eating and breathing for everyone to be forced to regard this chaos as a unity and to speak of his ego as though is was a one-fold and clearly detached and fixed phenomenon. Even the best of us shares this delusion.","I learned through my body and soul that it was necessary for me to sin, that I needed lust, that I had to strive for property and experience nausea and the depths of despair in order to learn not to resist them, in order to learn to love the world.","A father can pass on his nose and eyes and even his intelligence to his child, but not his soul. In every human being the soul is new","When we have learned how to listen to trees, then the brevity and the quickness and the childlike hastiness of our thoughts achieve an incomparable joy. Whoever has learned how to listen to trees no longer wants to be a tree. He wants to be nothing except what he is. That is home. That is happiness.","That is why we were drawn to one another and why we are brother and sister. I am going to teach you to dance and play and smile, and still not be happy. And you are going to teach me to think and to know and yet not be happy. Do you know that we are both children of the Devil?","The many-voiced song of the river echoed softly.  Siddhartha looked into the river and saw many pictures in the flowing water.  The river\'s voice was sorrowful.  It sang with yearning and sadness, flowing towards its goal ... Siddhartha was now listening intently...to this song of a thousand voices ... then the great song of a thousand voices consisted of one word: Om - Perfection ...  From that hour Siddhartha ceased to fight against his destiny.","Man is an onion made up of a hundred integuments, a texture made up of many threads. The ancient Asiatics knew this well enough, and in the Buddhist Yoga an exact technique was devised for unmasking the illusion of the personality. The human merry-go-round sees many changes: the illusion that cost India the efforts of thousands of years to unmask is the same illusion that the West has labored just as hard to maintain and strengthen.","When two cultures collide is the only time when true suffering exists.","One of the aphorisms occurred to me now and I wrote it under the picture: \\"Fate and temperament are two words for one and the same concept.\\" That was clear to me now.","...and the vessel was not full, his intellect was not satisfied, his soul was not at peace, his heart was not still.","I will not pretend to justify this espionage I carried on, and I will say openly that all these signs of a life full of intellectual curiosity, but thoroughly slovenly and disorderly at the same time, inspired me at first with aversion and mistrust. I am not only a middle-class man, living a regular life, fond of work and punctuality; I am also an abstainer and a nonsmoker, and these bottles in Haller\'s room pleased me even less than the rest of his artistic disorder.","With a secret smile, not unlike that of a healthy child,he walked along, peacefully, quietly. He wore his gown and walked along exactly like the other monks, but his face and his step, his peaceful downward glance, his peaceful downward-hanging hand, and every finger of his hand spoke of peace, spoke of completeness, sought nothing, imitated nothing, reflected a continuous quiet, an unfading light, an invulnerable peace.","Fortunately, like most children, I had learned what is most valuable, most indispensable for life before school years began, taught by apple trees, by rain and sun, river and woods.","Love is like death. It is fulfillment and an evening after which nothing more may follow.","Most men will not swim before they are able to.\' Is not that witty? Naturally, they won\'t swim! They are born for the solid earth, not for the water. And naturally they won\'t think. They are made for life, not for thought. Yes, and he who thinks, what\'s more, he who makes thought his business, he may go far in it, but he has bartered the solid earth for the water all the same, and one day he will drown.","Dreams and restless thoughts came flowing to him from the river, from the twinkling stars at night, from the sun\'s melting rays. Dreams and a restlessness of the soul came to him.","The marvel of the Bhagavad-Gita is its truly beautiful revelation of life\'s wisdom which enables philosophy to blossom into religion.","The bourgeois treasures nothing more highly than the self.... And so at the cost of intensity he achieves his own preservation andsecurity. His harvest is a quiet mind which he prefers to being possessed by God, as he prefers comfort to pleasure, convenience to liberty, and a pleasant temperature to that deathly inner consuming fire.","To such men the desperate and horrible thought has come that perhaps the whole of human life is but a bad joke, a violent and ill-fated abortion of the primal mother, a savage and dismal catastophe of nature.","I am a star in the firmament that observe the world, despises the world and consumed in its heat. I am the sea by night in a storm the sea shouting that accumulates new sins and to the ancient makes recompense. I am exiled from your world of pride polite, by pride defrauded, I am the king without crown. I am the passion without words without stones of the hearth, without weapons in the war, is my same force that make me sick","I was given the freedom to discover my own inclination and talents, to fashion my inmost pleasures and sorrows myself and to regard the future not as an alien higher power but as the hope\\n and product of my own strength.","His way had therefore come full circle, or rather had taken the form of an ellipse or a spiral, following as ever no straight unbroken line, for the rectilinear belongs only to Geometry and not to Nature and Life.","To be able to throw one\'s self away for the sake of a moment, to be able to sacrifice years for a woman\'s smile - that is happiness.","There is, so I believe, in the essence of everything, something that we cannot call learning. There is, my friend, only a knowledge - that is everywhere.","To nobody can you communicate in words and teachings, what happened to you in your hour of enlightenment.","Every natural form is latent within us, originates in the soul whose essence is eternity, whose essence we cannot know but which most often intimates itself to us as the power to love and create.","The river taught us how to listen with a silent heart, with a waiting open soul.","Every man\'s story is important, eternal and sacred. That is why every man, as long as he lives and fulfills the will of nature, is wondrous and worthy of every consideration.","Abraxas was the god who was both god and devil.","Toward seven o\'clock every morning, I leave my study and step Out on the bright terrace; the sun already burns resplendent Between the shadows of the fig tree, makes the low wall of coarse Granite warm to the touch. Here my tools lie ready and waiting, Each one an intimate, an ally: the round basket for weeds: The zappetta, the small hoe with a short haft . . . There\'s a rake here as well, at at times a mattock and spade, Or two watering cans filled with water warmed by the sun. With my basket and small hoe in hand, facing the sun, I Go out for my morning walk.","You will become tired, Siddhartha.\\" \\"I will become tired.\\" \\"You will fall asleep, Siddhartha.\\" \\"I will not fall asleep.\\" \\"You will die, Siddhartha.\\" \\"I will die.","I believe that the struggle against death, the unconditional and self-willed determination to live, is the mode of power behind the lives and activities of all outstanding men.","Solitude is independence. It had been my wish and with the years I had attained it. It was cold. Oh, cold enough! But it was also still, wonderfully still and vast like the cold stillness of space in which the stars revolve.","Wisdom is not communicable. The wisdom which a wise man tries to communicate always sounds foolish.","He saw all these forms and faces in a thousand relationships become newly born. Each one was mortal, a passionate, painful example of all that is transitory. Yet none of them died, they only changed, were always reborn, continually had a new face: only time stood between one face and another.","The world was beautiful when looked at in this way-without any seeking, so simple, so childlike.","What for me is bliss and life and ecstasy and exaltation, the world in general seeks at most in imagination; in life it finds it absurd.","Every healthy person must have a goal in life and that life must have content.","In the beginning was the myth.","Is not every life, every work fine?","You\'ve never lived what you are thinking, and that isn\'t good. Only the ideas we actually live are of any value.","I have known it for a long time but I have only just experienced it. Now I know it not only with my intellect, but with my eyes, with my heart, with my stomach.","There is, so I believe, in the essence of everything, something that we cannot call learning. There is, my friend, only a knowledge-that is everywhere, that is Atman, that is in me and you and in every creature, and I am beginning to believe that this knowledge has no worse enemy than the man of knowledge, than learning.","I am much inclined to live from my rucksack, and let my trousers fray as they like.","Only within yourself exists the other reality for which you long. I can give you nothing that has not already its being within yourself. I can throw open to you no picture gallery but your own soul.","You treat world history as a mathematician does mathematics, in which nothing but laws and formulas exist, no reality, no good and evil, no time, no yesterday, no tomorrow, nothing but an eternal, shallow, mathematical present.","That is where my dearest and brightest dreams have ranged \u2014 to hear for the duration of a heartbeat the universe and the totality of life in its mysterious, innate harmony.","All this had always been and he had never seen it; he was never present. Now he was present and belonged to it. Through his eyes he saw light and shadows; through his mind he was aware of moon and stars.","People know, or dimly feel, that if thinking is not kept pure and keen, and if respect for the world of mind is no longer operative, ships and automobiles will soon cease to run right, the engineer\'s slide rule and the computations of banks and stock exchanges will forfeit validity and authority, and chaos will ensue.","A game master or teacher who was primarily concerned with being close enough to the \\"innermost meaning\\" would be a very bad teacher. To be candid, I myself, for example, have never in my life said a word to my pupils about the \\"meaning\\" of music; if there is one it does not need my explanations. On the other hand I have always made a great point of having my pupils count their eighths and sixteenths nicely. Whatever you become, teacher, scholar, or musician, have respect for the \\"meaning\\" but do not imagine that it can be taught.","People with courage and character always seem sinister to the rest. It was a scandal that a breed of fearless and sinister people ran around freely, so they attached a nickname and a myth to these people to get even with them, to make up for the many times they had felt afraid.","Nothing is harder, yet nothing is more necessary, than to speak of certain things whose existence is neither demonstrable nor probable. The very fact that serious and conscientious men treat them as existing things brings them a step closer to existence and to the possibility of being born.","Life is always frightful. We cannot help it and we are responsible all the same. One\'s born and at once one is guilty.","If a bell failed to ring, if a stove smoked, if a wheel on a machine stuck, you knew at once where to look and did so with alacrity; you found the defect and knew how to cure it. But the thing within you, the secret mainspring that alone gave meaning to life, the thing within us that alone is living, alone is capable of feeling pleasure and pain, of craving happiness and experiencing it- that was unknown. You knew nothing about that, nothing at all, and if the mainspring failed there was no cure. Wasn\'t it insane?","So you find yourself surrounded by death and horror in the world, and you escape it into lust. But lust has no duration; it leaves you again in the desert.","The river is everywhere at the same time . . . everywhere and the present only exists for it, not the shadow of the past, nor the shadow of the future.","How absurd these words are, such as beast and beast of prey. One should not speak of animals in that way. They may be terrible sometimes, but they\'re much more right than men...They\'re never in any embarrassment. They always know what to do and how to behave themselves. They don\'t flatter and they don\'t intrude. They don\'t pretend. They are as they are, like stones or flowers or stars in the sky.","Knowledge can be conveyed, but not wisdom. It can be found, it can be lived, it is possible to be carried by it, miracles can be performed with it, but it cannot be expressed in words and taught.","It is a pity that you students aren\'t fully aware of the luxury and abundance in which you live.","What constitutes a real, live human being is more of a mystery than ever these days, and men each one of whom is a valuable, unique experiment on the part of nature are shot down wholesale.","When I have neither pleasure nor pain and have been breathing for a while the lukewarm insipid air of these so-called good and tolerable days, I feel so bad in my childish soul that I smash my rusty lyre of thanksgiving in the face of the slumbering god of contentment and would rather feel the most devilish pain burn in me than this warmth of a well-heated room. - Harry Haller","One of the disadwantages of school and learning, he thought dreamily, was that the mind seemed to have the tendency too see and represent all things as though they were flat and had only two dimensions. This, somehow, seemed to render all matters of intellect shallow and worthless.","For a while I shall still be leaving, looking back at you as you slip away into the magic islands of the mind. But for a while now all are alive, believing that in a single poignant hour we did say all that we could ever say in a great flowing out of radiant power. It was like seeing and then going blind.","It is remarkable, all that men can swallow. For a good ten minutes I read a newspaper. I allowed the spirit of an irresponsible man who chews and munches another\'s words in his mouth, and gives them out again undigested, to enter into me through my eyes.","To study history means submitting to chaos and nevertheless retaining faith in order and meaning.","That life is difficult, I have often bitterly realized.","I have transported many, thousands; and to all of them, my river has been nothing but an obstacle on their travels. They travelled to seek money and business, and for weddings, and on pilgrimages, and the river was obstructing their path, and the ferryman\'s job was to get them quickly across that obstacle. But for some among thousands, a few, four or five, the river has stopped being an obstacle, they have heard its voice, they have listened to it, and the river has become sacred to them, as it has become sacred to me.","Those who direct the maximum force of their desires toward the center, toward true being, toward perfection, seem quieter than the passionate souls because the flame of their fervor cannot always be seen.","You knew all along that your sanctioned world was only half the world, and you tried to suppress the other half the same way the priests and teachers do. You won\'t succeed. No one succeeds in this once he has begun to think.","...Haller\'s sickness of the soul, as I now know, is not the eccentricity of a single individual, but the sickness of the times themselves, the neurosis of that generation to which Haller belongs, a sickness, it seems, that by no means attacks the weak and worthless only but, rather, precisely those who are strongest in spirit and richest in gifts.","As every flower fades and as all youth departs, so life at every stage, so every virtue, so our grasp of truth blooms in its day and may not last forever. Since life may summon us at every age, be ready, heart, for parting, new endeavour, be ready bravely and without remorse to find new light that old ties cannot give. In all beginnings dwells a magic force for guarding us and helping us to live.","You show the world as a complete, unbroken chain, an eternal chain, linked together by cause and effect.","The realization that my problem was one that concerned all men, a problem of living and thinking, suddenly swept over me and I was overwhelmed by fear and respect as I suddenly saw and felt how deeply my own personal life and opinions were immersed in the eternal stream of great ideas. Though it offered some confirmation and gratification, the realization was not really a joyful one. It was hard and had a harsh taste because it implied responsibility and no longer being allowed to be a child; it meant standing on one\u2019s own feet.","He looked around, as if he was seeing the world for the first time. Beautiful was the world, colorful was the world, strange and mysterious was the world! Here was blue, here was yellow, here was green, the sky and the river flowed, the forest and the mountains were rigid, all of it was beautiful, all of it was mysterious and magical, and in its midst was he, Siddhartha, the awakening one, on the path to himself.","A thousand times I was ready to regret and take back my rash statement - yet it had been the truth.","A soul that is ruined in the bud will frequently return to the springtime of its beginning and its promise-filled childhood, as though it could discover new hopes there and retie the broken threads of life. The shoots grow rapidly and eagerly, but it is only a sham life that will never be a genuine tree.","The mind is international and supra-national ... it ought to serve not war and annihilation, but peace and reconciliation.","To recognize causes is to think, and through thought alone feelings become knowledge and are not lost, but become real and begin to mature.","If I were poet now, I would not resist the temptation to trace my life back through the delicate shadows of my childhood to the precious and sheltered sources of my earliest memories. But these possessions are far too dear and sacred for the person I now am to spoil for myself. All there is to say of my childhood is that it was good and happy. I was given the freedom to discover my own inclinations and talents, to fashion my inmost pleasures and sorrows myself and to regard the future not as an alien higher power but as the hope and product of my own strength.","But peace, too, is a living thing and like all life it must wax and wane, accommodate, withstand trials, and undergo changes.","Gratitude is not a virtue I believe in, and to me it seems hypocritical to expect it from a child.","The cup was emptied and would never be filled again.","What is the holding of breath? It is a flight from the Self, it is a temporary escape from the torment of Self. It is a temporary palliative against the pain and folly of life.","And what is called history at school, and all we learn by heart there about heroes and geniuses and great deeds and fine emotions, is all nothing but a swindle invented by the schoolmasters for educational reasons to keep children occupied for a given number of years. It has always been so and always will be.","In Germany I have been acknowledged again since the fall of Hitler, but my works, partly suppressed by the Nazis and partly destroyed by the war; have not yet been republished there.","Knowledge can be communicated, but not wisdom.","Friendship is identification and difference","Art is contemplation of the world in a state of grace and imaginatively reflecting that subjective understanding.","This happiness consisted of nothing else but the harmony of the few things around me with my own existence, a feeling of contentment and well-being that needed no changes and no intensification.","I am fond of music I think because it is so amoral. Everything else is moral and I am after something that isn\'t. I have always found moralizing intolerable.","Remember this: one can be a strict logician or grammarian and at the same time full of imagination and music.","At that time two opposing concepts of the Game called forth commentary and discussion. The foremost players distinguished two principal types of Game, the formal and the psychological.","lucid and quiet his voice hovered above the listeners, like a light, like a starry sky.","How could I fail to be a lone wolf, and an uncouth hermit, as I did not share one of its aims nor understand one of its pleasures?","It was still quiet in the house, and not a sound was heard from outside, either. Were it not for this silence, my reverie would probably have been disrupted by reminders of daily duties, of getting up and going to school.","There were now and then, though rarely, the hours that brought the welcome shock, pulled down the walls and brought me back again from my wanderings to the living heart of the world. Sadly and yet deeply moved, I set myself to recall the last of these experiences. It was at a concert of lovely old music. After two of three notes of the piano the door was opened of a sudden to the other world. I sped through heaven and saw God at work. I suffered holy pains. I dropped all my defenses and was afraid of nothing in the world. I accepted all things and to all things I gave up my heart.","Each man carries the vestiges of his birth; the slime and eggshells of his primeval past with him to the end of his days. Some never become human, remaining frog, lizard, ant. Some are human above the waist, fish below.","If my life were not a dangerous, painful experiment, if I did not constantly skirt the abyss and feel the void under my feet, my life would have no meaning and I would not have been able to write anything.","That seems to be the way of things. Everyone takes, everyone gives. Life is like that.","No, I\'m not religious, I\'m sorry to say. But I was once and shall be again. There is no time now to be religious.\\" \\"No time. Does it need time to be religious?\\" \\"Oh, yes. To be religious you must have time and, even more, independence of time. You can\'t be religious in earnest and at the same time live in actual things and still take them seriously, time and money and the Od\xe9on Bar and all that.","Therefore, I see whatever exists as good, death is to me like life, sin like holiness, wisdom like foolishness, everything has to be as it is, everything only requires my consent, only my willingness, my loving agreement, to be good for me, to do nothing but work for my benefit, to be unable to ever harm me.","So wie die Verruecktheit in einem hoeheren Sinn, der Anfang aller Weisheit ist, so ist die Schizophrenie der Anfang aller Kunst, aller Phantasie. (As insanity in a higher sense, is the beginning of all wisdom, so is schizophrenia the beginning of all art, all fantasy.)","It was lovely, and tempting, to exert power over men and to shine before others, but power also had its perditions and perils.","The world, as it is now, wants to die, wants to perish \u2014 and it will.","If a night-moth were to concentrate its will on flying to a star or some equally unattainable object, it wouldn\'t succeed. Only, it wouldn\'t even try in the first place. A moth confines its search to what has sense and value for it, what it needs, what is indispensable to its life... if I imagined that I wanted under all circumstances to get to the North Pole, then to achieve it I would have to desire it strongly enough that my whole being was ruled by it. But if I were to decide to will that the pastor should stop wearing his glasses, it would be useless. That would be making a game of it.","In the beginning was the myth. God, in his search for self-expression, invested the souls of Hindus, Greeks, and Germans with poetic shapes and continues to invest each child\'s soul with poetry every day.","Once it happened, as I lay awake at night, that I suddenly spoke in verses, in verses so beautiful and strange that I did not venture to think of writing them down, and then in the morning they vanished; and yet they lay hidden within me like the hard kernel within an old brittle husk.","Here and there in the ancient literature we encounter legends of wise and mysterious games that were conceived and played by scholars, monks, or the courtiers of cultured princes. These might take the form of chess games in which the pieces and squares had secret meanings in addition to their usual functions.","Was that really love? I saw all these passionate people reel about and drift haphazardly as if driven by a storm, the man filled with desire today, satiated on the morrow, loving fiercely and discarding brutally, sure of no affection and happy in no love.","Young people have many pleasures and many sorrows, because they only have themselves to think of, so every wish and every notion assume importance; every pleasure is tasted to the full, but also every sorrow, and many who find that their wishes cannot be fulfilled, immediately put an end to their lives.","Love can be begged, bought, or received as a gift, one can find it in the street, but one cannot steal it.","It was the first rent in the holy image of my father, it was the first fissure in the columns that had upheld my childhood, which every individual must destroy before he can become himself.","For the air of lonely men surrounded him now, a still atmosphere in which the world around him slipped away, leaving him incapable of relationship, an atmosphere against which neither will nor longing availed. This was one of the significant earmarks of his life.","I can think. I can wait. I can fast.","But your questions, which are unanswerable without exception, all spring from the same erroneous thinking.","And whether this happiness lasted a hundred seconds or ten minutes, it was so far removed from time that it resembled every other genuine happiness as completely as one fluttering blue lycaenid butterfly resembles another.","Everything is necessary, everything needs only my agreement, my assent, my loving understanding; then all is well with me and nothing can harm me.","The way to innocence, to the uncreated and to God leads on, not back, not back to the wolf or to the child, but ever further into sin, ever deeper into human life.","You should never be afraid of people... such fear can destroy us completely. You\'ve simply got to get rid of it, if you want to turn into someone decent. You understand that, don\'t you?","In fear I hurried this way and that. I had the taste of blood and chocolate in my mouth, the one as hateful as the other.","For me, however, that beloved, glowing little word happiness has become associated with everything I have felt since childhood upon hearing the sound of the word itself.","I was out of my bed in one second, trembling with excitement, and I dashed to the door and into the adjoining room, where I could watch the streets below from the windows.","I realize that some people will not believe that a child of little more than ten years is capable of having such feelings. My story is not intended for them. I am telling it to those who have a better knowledge of man. The adult who has learned to translate a part of his feelings into thoughts notices the absence of these thoughts in a child, and therefore comes to believe that the child lacks these experiences, too. Yet rarely in my life have I felt and suffered as deeply as at that time.","In my brain were stored a thousand pictures.","Without a mother, one cannot love. Without a mother, one cannot die.","The human attitude of which classical music is the expression is always the same; it is always based on the same kind of insight into life and strives for the same kind of victory over blind change. Classical music as gesture signifies knowledge of the tragedy of the human condition, affirmation of human destiny, courage, cheerful serenity.","What a wonderful sleep it had been! Never had sleep so refreshed him, so renewed him, so rejuvenated him! Perhaps he had really died, perhaps he had been drowned and was reborn in another form. No, he recognized himself, he recognized his hands and feet, the place where he lay and the Self in his breast, Siddhartha, self-willed, individualistic. But this Siddhartha was somewhat changed, renewed. He had slept wonderfully. He was remarkably awake, happy and curious.","I have no desire to walk on water,\\" said Siddhartha. \\"Let the old shamans satisfy themselves with such skills\\".","What isn\'t part of ourselves doesn\'t disturb us.","I had grown a thin mustache, I was a full-grown man, and yet I was completely helpless and without a goal in life.","\\"For even the most childish intoxication with progress will soon be forced to recognize that writing and books have a function that is eternal. It will become evident that formulations in words and the handling on of these formulations through writing are not only important aids but actually the only means by which humanity can have a history and continuing consciousness of itself.\\"","I shall begin my story with an experience I had when I was ten and attended our small town\'s Latin school.","Oh, if I had had a friend at this moment, a friend in an attic room, dreaming by candlelight and with a violin lying ready at his hand! How I should have slipped up to him in his quiet hour, noiselessly climbing the winding stair to take him by surprise, and then with talk and music we should have held heavenly festival throughout the night!","\\"You do not really love me \u2014 you love nobody. Is that not true?\\" \\"Maybe,\\" said Siddhartha wearily. \\"I am like you. You cannot love either, otherwise how could you practice love as an art? Perhaps people like us cannot love. Ordinary people can \u2014 that is their secret.\\"","Yes, what we are doing is probably mad, and probably it is good and necessary all the same. It is not a good thing when man overstrains his reason and tries to reduce to rational order matters that are susceptible of rational treatment. Then there arise ideals such as those of the Americans or of the Bolsheviks. Both are extraordinarily rational, and both lead to a frightful oppression and impoverishment of life, because they simplify it so crudely. The likeness of man, once a high ideal, is in process of becoming a machine-made article. It is for madmen like us, perhaps, to ennoble it again.","A girl had bidden me eat and drink and sleep, and had shown me friendship and had laughed at me and had called me a silly little boy. And this wonderful friend had talked to me of the saints and shown me that even when I had outdone myself in absurdity I was not alone.","All the women of this fevered night, all that I had danced with, all whom I had kindled or who have kindled me, all whom I had courted, all who had clung to me with longing, all whom I had followed with enraptured eyes were melted together and had become one, the one whom I held in my arms.","It was all a lie, it all stank, stank of lies, it all gave the illusion of meaning and happiness and beauty, and all of it was just putrefaction that no one would admit to. Bitter was the taste of the world. Life was a torment.","Alas, Siddhartha, I see you suffering, but you\'re suffering a pain at which one would like to laugh, at which you\'ll soon laugh for yourself.","In any case, the most lively young people become the best old people, not those who pretend to be as wise as grandfathers while they are still at school.","Yes, I am going into the woods; I am going into the unity of all things.","You wouldn\'t consider all the bipeds you pass on the street human beings simply because they walk upright and carry their young in their bellies nine months! It is obvious how many of them are fish or sheep, worms or angels, how many are ants, how many are bees!","Seeking means: to have a goal; but finding means: to be free, to be receptive, to have no goal. You, O worthy one, are perhaps indeed a seeker, for in striving towards your goal, you do not see many things that are under your nose.","I called the world of phenomena an illusion, I called my eyes and my tongue an accident, valueless phenomena. No, that is all over; I have awakened, I have really awakened and I have just been born today.","The day had gone by just as days go by. I had killed it in accordance with my primitive and retiring way of life.","Everything that was not suffered to the end and finally concluded, recurred, and the same sorrows were undergone.","Did all this make sense?","Deeply, he felt the love for the run-away in his heart, like a wound, and he felt at the same time that this wound had not been given to him in order to turn the knife in it, that it had to become a blossom and had to shine. That this wound did not blossom yet, did not shine yet, at this hour, made him sad. Instead of the desired goal, which had drawn him here following the runaway son, there was now emptiness.","The judge who sits over the murderer and looks into his face, and at one moment recognizes all the emotions and potentialities and possibilities of the murderer in his own soul and hears the murderer\'s voice as his own, is at the next moment one and indivisible as the judge, and scuttles back into the shell of his cultivated self and does his duty and condemns the murderer to death.","Everyone can reach his goal, if he can think, wait and fast.","You should not take old people who are already dead seriously. It does them injustice. We immortals do not like things to be taken seriously. We like joking. Seriousness, young man, is an accident of time. It consists, I don\'t mind telling you in confidence, in putting too high a value on time. I, too, once put too high a value on time. For that reason I wished to be a hundred years old. In eternity, however, there is no time, you see. Eternity is a mere moment, just long enough for a joke.","You learned people and artists have, no doubt, all sorts of superior things in your heads; but you\'re human beings like the rest of us, and we, too, have our dreams and fancies.","He had thrown himself away, he had lost interest in everything, and life, falling in with his feelings, had demanded nothing of him. He had lived as an outsider, an idler and onlooker, well liked in his young manhood, alone in his illness and advancing years. Seized with weariness, he sat down on the wall, and the river murmured darkly in his thoughts.","When all the Self was conquered and dead, when all passions and desires were silent, then the last must awaken, the innermost of Being that is no longer Self - the great secret!","Truly, nothing in the world has so occupied my thoughts as this I, this riddle, the fact I am alive, that I am separated and isolated from all others, that I am Siddhartha! And about nothing in the world do I know less about than me, about Siddhartha!","If man has nothing to eat, fasting is the most intelligent thing he can do. If, for instance, Siddhartha had not learned to fast, he would have had to seek some kind of work today, either with you, or elsewhere, for hunger would have driven him. But as it is, Siddhartha can wait calmly. He is not impatient, he is not in need, he can ward off hunger for a long time and laugh at it. Therefore, fasting is useful, sir.","When a writer receives praise or blame, when he arouses sympathy or is ridiculed, when he is loved or rejected, it is not on the strength of his thoughts and dreams as a whole, but only of that infinitesimal part which has been able to make its way through the narrow channel of language and the equally narrow channel of the reader\'s understanding.","The bourgeois today burns as heretics and hangs as criminals those to whom he erects monuments tomorrow.","He saw merchants trading, princes hunting, mourners wailing for their dead, whores offering themselves, physicians trying to help the sick, priests determining the most suitable day for seeding, lovers loving, mothers nursing their children\u2014and all of this was not worthy of one look from his eye, it all lied, it all stank, it all stank of lies, it all pretended to be meaningful and joyful and beautiful, and it all was just concealed putrefaction. The world tasted bitter. Life was torture","...  let us recall the well-known statement of a university professor in the Republic of the Massagetes: \'Not the faculty but His Excellency the General can properly determine the sum of two and two.\'","But one thing this doctrine, so clean, so venerable, does not contain: it does nto contain the secret of what the Sublime One himself experienced, he alone among the hundreds of thousands. This is why I am continuing my wanderings not to seek another, better doctrine, because I know there is none, but to leave behind all the teachings and all teachers, and either attain my goal alone or die.","And here is a doctrine at which you will laugh. It seems to me, Govinda, that love is the most important thing in the world.","They slept profoundly, desperately, greedily, as though for the last time, as though they had been condemned to stay awake forever and had to drink in all the sleep in the world during these last hours.","Romantic souvenirs had a way of attaching themselves to one when one wanted to move on, but they were not to be taken seriously.","Love is stronger than violence.","Until 1914 I loved to travel; I often went to Italy and once spent a few months in India. Since then I have almost entirely abandoned travelling, and I have not been outside of Switzerland for over ten years.","In each individual the spirit is made flesh, in each one the whole of creation suffers, in each one a Savior is crucified.","Everyone gives what he has.  The soldier gives strength, the merchant goods, the teacher instruction, the farmer rice, the fisherman fish.","When a tree is cut down and reveals its naked death-wound to the sun, one can read its whole history in the luminous, inscribed disk of its trunk: in the rings of its years, its scars, all the struggle, all the suffering, all the sickness, all the happiness and prosperity stand truly written, the narrow years and the luxurious years, the attacks withstood, the storms endured.","All men of goodwill have this in common - that our works put us to shame.","All it has experienced, tasted, suffered: The course of years, generations of animals, Oppression, recovery, friendship of sun and - Wind Will pour forth each day in the song Of its rustling foliage, in the friendly Gesture of its gently swaying crown, In the delicate sweet scent of resinous Sap moistening the sleep-glued buds, And the eternal game of lights and Shadows it plays with itself, content.","The old man slowly raised himself from the piano stool, fixed those cheerful blue eyes piercingly and at the same time with unimaginable friendliness upon him, and said: \\"Making music together is the best way for two people to become friends. There is none easier. That is a fine thing. I hope you and I shall remain friends. Perhaps you too will learn how to make fugues, Joseph.","I sped through heaven and saw god at work. I suffered holy pains. I dropped all my defenses and was afraid of nothing in the world. I accepted all things and to all things I gave up my heart.","Our god\'s name is Abraxas and he is God and Satan and he contains both the luminous and the dark world.","Among mathematicians, even in those days, the reputation of being a good Glass Bead Game player meant a great deal; it was equivalent to being a very good mathematician.","Nevertheless, whether in occurrences lasting days, hours or mere minutes at a time, I have experienced happiness often, and have had brief encounters with it in my later years, even in old age.","You\'re quite right there,\\" he said. \\"I have practiced abstinence myself for years, and had my time of fasting, too, but now I find myself once more beneath the sign of Aquarius, a dark and humid constellation.","Among the letters my readers write me, there is a certain category which is continuously growing, and which I see as a symptom of the increasing intellectualization of the relationship between readers and literature.","One day I would be a better hand at the game. One day I would learn how to laugh. Pablo was waiting for me, and Mozart too.","For the first time in my life I tasted death, and death tasted bitter, for death is birth, is fear and dread of some terrible renewal.","...As every one of us knows, there are some festivals and games in which everything goes right, and every element lifts up, animates, and exalts every other, just as there are theatrical and musical performances which without any clearly discernible cause seem to ascend miraculously to glorious climaxes and intensely felt experiences, whereas others, just as well prepared, remain no more than decent tries.","For me, trees have always been the most penetrating preachers. I revere them when they live in tribes and families, in forests and groves. And even more I revere them when they stand alone. They are like lonely persons. Not like hermits who have stolen away out of some weakness, but like great, solitary men, like Beethoven and Nietzsche. In their highest boughs the world rustles, their roots rest in infinity; but they do not lose themselves there, they struggle with all the force of their lives for one thing only: to fulfil themselves according to their own laws, to build up their own form, to represent themselves. Nothing is holier, nothing is more exemplary than a beautiful, strong tree. When a tree is cut down and reveals its naked death-wound to the sun, one can read its whole history in the luminous, inscribed disk of its trunk: in the rings of its years, its scars, all the struggle, all the suffering, all the sickness, all the happiness and prosperity stand truly written, the narrow years and the luxurious years, the attacks withstood, the storms endured. And every young farmboy knows that the hardest and noblest wood has the narrowest rings, that high on the mountains and in continuing danger the most indestructible, the strongest, the ideal trees grow. Trees are sanctuaries. Whoever knows how to speak to them, whoever knows how to listen to them, can learn the truth. They do not preach learning and precepts, they preach, undeterred by particulars, the ancient law of life. A tree says: A kernel is hidden in me, a spark, a thought, I am life from eternal life. The attempt and the risk that the eternal mother took with me is unique, unique the form and veins of my skin, unique the smallest play of leaves in my branches and the smallest scar on my bark. I was made to form and reveal the eternal in my smallest special detail. A tree says: My strength is trust. I know nothing about my fathers, I know nothing about the thousand children that every year spring out of me. I live out the secret of my seed to the very end, and I care for nothing else. I trust that God is in me. I trust that my labor is holy. Out of this trust I live. When we are stricken and cannot bear our lives any longer, then a tree has something to say to us: Be still! Be still! Look at me! Life is not easy, life is not difficult. Those are childish thoughts. Let God speak within you, and your thoughts will grow silent. You are anxious because your path leads away from mother and home. But every step and every day lead you back again to the mother. Home is neither here nor there. Home is within you, or home is nowhere at all. A longing to wander tears my heart when I hear trees rustling in the wind at evening. If one listens to them silently for a long time, this longing reveals its kernel, its meaning. It is not so much a matter of escaping from one\'s suffering, though it may seem to be so. It is a longing for home, for a memory of the mother, for new metaphors for life. It leads home. Every path leads homeward, every step is birth, every step is death, every grave is mother. So the tree rustles in the evening, when we stand uneasy before our own childish thoughts: Trees have long thoughts, long-breathing and restful, just as they have longer lives than ours. They are wiser than we are, as long as we do not listen to them. But when we have learned how to listen to trees, then the brevity and the quickness and the childlike hastiness of our thoughts achieve an incomparable joy. Whoever has learned how to listen to trees no longer wants to be a tree. He wants to be nothing except what he is. That is home. That is happiness.","Wisdom cannot be imparted. Wisdom that a wise man attempts to impart always sounds like foolishness to someone else ... Knowledge can be communicated, but not wisdom. One can find it, live it, do wonders through it, but one cannot communicate and teach it.","We are sun and moon, dear friend; we are sea and land. It is not our purpose to become each other; it is to recognize each other, to learn to see the other and honor him for what he is: each the other\'s opposite and complement.","Some of us think holding on makes us strong but sometimes it is letting go","There is no reality except the one contained within us. That is why so many people live such an unreal life. They take the images outside of them for reality and never allow the world within to assert itself.","There is no escape. You can\'t be a vagabond and an artist and still be a solid citizen, a wholesome, upstanding man. You want to get drunk, so you have to accept the hangover. You say yes to the sunlight and pure fantasies, so you have to say yes to the filth and the nausea. Everything is within you, gold and mud, happiness and pain, the laughter of childhood and the apprehension of death. Say yes to everything, shirk nothing. Don\'t try to lie to yourself. You are not a solid citizen. You are not a Greek. You are not harmonious, or the master of yourself. You are a bird in the storm. Let it storm! Let it drive you! How much have you lied! A thousand times, even in your poems and books, you have played the harmonious man, the wise man, the happy, the enlightened man. In the same way, men attacking in war have played heroes, while their bowels twitched. My God, what a poor ape, what a fencer in the mirror man is- particularly the artist- particularly myself!","Words do not express thoughts very well. they always become a little different immediately they are expressed, a little distorted, a little foolish. And yet it also pleases me and seems right that what is of value and wisdom to one man seems nonsense to another.","The bird fights its way out of the egg. The egg is the world. Who would be born must first destroy a world. The bird flies to God. That God\'s name is Abraxas.","One never reaches home,\' she said. \'But where paths that have an affinity for each other intersect, the whole world looks like home, for a time.","In eternity there is no time, only an instant long enough for a joke.","When I have neither pleasure nor pain and have been breathing for a while the lukewarm insipid air of these so called good and tolerable days, I feel so bad in my childish soul that I smash my moldering lyre of thanksgiving in the face of the slumbering god of contentment and would rather feel the very devil burn in me than this warmth of a well-heated room. A wild longing for strong emotions and sensations seethes in me, a rage against this toneless, flat, normal and sterile life. I have a mad impulse to smash something, a warehouse, perhaps, or a cathedral, or myself, to commit outrages, to pull off the wigs of a few revered idols...","When someone is seeking, said Siddartha, \u201cIt happens quite easily that he only sees the thing that he is seeking; that he is unable to find anything, unable to absorb anything, because he is only thinking of the thing he is seeking, because he has a goal, because he is obsessed with his goal. Seeking means: to have a goal; but finding means: to be free, to be receptive, to have no goal. You, O worthy one, are perhaps indeed a seeker, for in striving towards your goal, you do not see many things that are under your nose.\u201d","Good that you ask -- you should always ask, always have doubts.","Most men will not swim before they are able to. Is that not witty? Naturally, they won\'t swim! They are born for the solid earth, not for the water. And naturally they wont think. They are made for life, not for thought. Yes, and he who thinks, what\u2019s more, he who makes thought his business, he may go far in it, but he has bartered the solid earth for the water all the same, and one day he will drown.\u201d","You are only afraid if you are not in harmony with yourself. People are afraid because they have never owned up to themselves. A whole society composed of men afraid of the unknown within them!","A wild longing for strong emotions and sensations seethes in me, a rage against this toneless, flat, normal and sterile life. I have a mad impulse to smash something, a warehouse perhaps, or a cathedral, or myself, to committ outrages...","Natures of your kind, with strong, delicate senses, the soul-oriented, the dreamers, poets, lovers are always superior to us creatures of the mind. You take your being from your mothers. You live fully; you were endowed with the strength of love, the ability to feel. Whereas we creatures of reason, we don\'t live fully; we live in an arid land, even though we often seem to guide and rule you. Yours is the plentitude of life, the sap of the fruit, the garden of passion, the beautiful landscape of art. Your home is the earth; ours is the world of ideas. You are in danger of drowning in the world of the senses; ours is the danger of suffocating in an airless void. You are an artist; I am a thinker. You sleep at your mother\'s breast; I wake in the desert. For me the sun shines; for you the moon and the stars.","I have always been a great dreamer. In dreams I have always been more active than in my real life, and these shadows sapped me of my health and energy.","I learned through my body and soul that it was necessary to sin, that I needed lust, that I had to strive for property and experience nausea and the depths of despair in order to learn not to resist them, in order to learn to love the world, and no longer compare it with some kind of desired imaginary vision of perfection, but to leave it as it is, to love it and be glad to belong to it.","The things we see are the same things that are within us. There is no reality except the one contained within us. That is why so many people live such an unreal life. They take the images outside them for reality and never allow the world within to assert itself.","It is not our purpose to become each other; it is to recognize each other, to learn to see the other and honor him for what he is.","What you call passion is not a spiritual force, but friction between the soul and the outside world. Where passion dominates, that does not signify the presence of greater desire and ambition, but rather the misdirection of these qualities toward and isolated and false goal, with a consequent tension and sultriness in the atmosphere. Those who direct the maximum force of their desires toward the center, toward true being, toward perfection, seem quieter than the passionate souls because the flame of their fervor cannot always be seen. In argument, for example, they will not shout or wave their arms. But, I assure you, they are nevertheless, burning with subdued fires.","You are only afraid if you are not in harmony with yourself.","No permanence is ours; we are a waveThat flows to fit whatever form it finds","How foolish it is to wear oneself out in vain longing for warmth! Solitude is independence.","We who bore the mark might well be considered by the rest of the world as strange, even as insane and dangerous. We had awoken, or were awakening, and we were striving for an ever perfect state of wakefulness, whereas the ambition and quest for happiness of the others consisted of linking their opinions, ideals, and duties, their life and happiness, ever more closely with those of the herd. They, too, strove; they, too showed signs of strength and greatness. But as we saw it, whereas we marked men represented Nature\'s determination to create something new, individual, and forward-looking, the others lived in the determination to stay the same. For them mankind--which they loved as much as we did--was a fully formed entity that had to be preserved and protected. For us mankind was a distant future toward which we were all journeying, whose aspect no one knew, whose laws weren\'t written down anywhere.","Oh, if only it were possible to find understanding, Joseph exclaimed. \u201cIf only there were a dogma to believe in. Everything is contradictory, everything tangential; there are no certainties anywhere. Everything can be interpreted one way and then again interpreted in the opposite sense. The whole of world history can be explained as development and progress and can also be seen as nothing but decadence and meaninglessness. Isn\u2019t there any truth? Is there no real and valid doctrine?\u201dThe master had never heard him speak so fervently. He walked on in silence for a little, then said: \u201cThere is truth, my boy. But the doctrine you desire, absolute, perfect dogma that alone provides wisdom, does not exist. Nor should you long for a perfect doctrine, my friend. Rather, you should long for the perfection of yourself. The deity is within you, not in ideas and books. Truth is lived, not taught. Be prepared for conflicts, Joseph Knecht - I can see that they already have begun.\u201d","Within you, there is a stillness and a sanctuary to which you can retreat at anytime and be yourself.","I want to tell you something today, something that I have known for a long while, and you know it too; but perhaps you have never said it to yourself. I am going to tell you now what it is that I know about you and me and our fate. You, Harry, have been an artist and a thinker, a man full of joy and faith, always on the track of what is great and eternal, never content with the trivial and petty. But the more life has awakened you and brought you back to yourself, the greater has you need been and the deeper the sufferings and dread and despair that have overtaken you, till you were up to your neck in them. And all that you once knew and loved and revered as beautiful and sacred, all the belief you once had in mankind and our high destiny, has been of no avail and has lost its worth and gone to pieces. Your faith found no more air to breathe. And suffocation is a hard death. Is that true, Harry? Is that your fate?","O how incomprehensible everything was, and actually sad, although it was also beautiful. One knew nothing. One lived and ran about the earth and rode through forests, and certain things looked so challenging and promising and nostalgic: a star in the evening, a blue harebell, a reed-green pond, the eye of a person or a cow. And sometimes it seemed that something never seen yet long desired was about to happen, that a veil would drop from it all, but then it passed, nothing happened, the riddle remained unsolved, the secret spell unbroken, and in the end one grew old and looked cunning . . . or wise . . . and still one knew nothing perhaps, was still waiting and listening.","Everyone can perform magic, everyone can reach his goals, ifhe is able to think, if he is able to wait, if he is able to fast.","When you throw a rock into the water, it will speed on the fastest course to the bottom of the water. This is how it is when Siddhartha has a goal, a resolution. Siddhartha does nothing, he waits, he thinks, he fasts, but he passes through the things of the world like a rock through water, without doing anything, without stirring; he is drawn, he lets himself fall. His goal attracts him, because he doesn\'t let anything enter his soul which might oppose the goal. This is what Siddhartha has learned among the Samanas. This is what fools call magic and which they think is effected by demons. Nothing is effected by demons, there are no demons. Everyone can perform magic, everyone can reach his goals, if he is able to think, if he is able to wait, if he is able to fast.","Every age, every culture, every custom and tradition has its own character, its own weakness and its own strength, it beauties and ugliness; accepts certain sufferings as matters of course, puts up patiently with certain evils. Human life is reduced to real suffering, to hell, only when two ages, two cultures and religions overlap... Now there are times when a whole generation is caught in this way between two ages, two modes of life, with the consequence that it loses all power to understand itself and has no standard, no security, no simple acquiescence. Naturally, every one does not feel this equally strongly.","Each of us has to find out for himself what is permitted and what is forbidden.. forbidden for him. It\'s possible for one never to transgress a single law and still be a bastard. And vice versa.","I cannot understand what pleasures and joys they are that drive people to the overcrowded railways and hotels, into the packed caf\xe9s with the suffocating and oppressive music, to the Bars and variety entertainments, to World Exhibitions, to the Corsos. I cannot understand nor share these joys, though they are within my reach, for which thousands of others strive. On the other hand, what happens to me in my rare hours of joy, what for me is bliss and life and ecstasy and exaltation, the world in general seeks at most in imagination; in life it finds it absurd. And in fact, if the world is right, if this music of the caf\xe9s, these mass enjoyments and these Americanised men who are pleased with so little are right, then I am wrong, I am crazy. I am in truth the Steppenwolf that I often call myself; that beast astray who finds neither home nor joy nor nourishment in a world that is strange and incomprehensible to him.","There is, in fact, no way back either to the wolf or to the child. From the very start there is no innocence and no singleness. Every created thing, even the simplest, is already guilty, already multiple. It has been thrown into the muddy stream of being and may never more swim back again to its source. The way to innocence, to the uncreated and to God leads on, not back to the wolf or to the child, but ever further into sin, ever deeper into human life. Nor will suicide really solve your problem [...] You will, instead, embark on the longer and wearier and harder road of life. You will have to multiply many times your two-fold being and complicate your complexities still further. Instead of narrowing your world and simplifying your soul, you will have to absorb more and more of the world and at last take all of it up in your painfully expanded soul, if you are ever to find peace. This is the road that Buddha and every great man has gone, whether consciously or not, insofar as fortune has favored his quest.","A wild longing for strong emotions and sensations seethes in me, a rage against this toneless, flat, normal and sterile life.","Our leaders strain every nerve and with success, to get the next war going, while the rest of us, meanwhile, dance the fox trot, earn money and eat chocolates...And perhaps...it has always been the same and always will be, and what is called history at school, and all we learn by heart there about heroes and geniuses and great deeds and fine emotions, is all nothing but a swindle invented by the schoolmasters for educational reasons to keep children occupied for a given number of years. It has always been so and always will be. Time and the world, money and power belong to the small people and shallow people. To the rest, to the real men belongs nothing...eternity...it isn\'t fame. Fame exists in that sense only for the schoolmasters. No, it isn\'t fame. It is what I call eternity...The music of Mozart belongs there and the poetry of your great poets. The saints, too, belong there, who have worked wonders and suffered martyrdom and given a great example to men. But the image of every true act, the strength of every true feeling, belongs to eternity just as much, even though no one knows of it or sees it or records it or hands it down to posterity. In eternity there is no posterity...It is the kingdom on the other side of time and appearances. It is there we belong. There is our home. It is that which our heart strives for...And we have no one to guide us. Our only guide is our homesickness.","The mistaken and unhappy notion that a man is an enduring unity is known to you. It is also known to you that a man consists of a multitude of souls, of numerous selves. The separation of the unity of the personality into these numerous pieces passes for madness. Science has invented the name schizomania for it. Science is in this so far right as no multiplicity maybe dealt with unless there be a series, a certain order and grouping. It is wrong insofar as it holds that one only and binding lifelong order is possible for the multiplicity of subordinate selves. This error of science has many unpleasant consequences, and the single advantage of simplifying the work of the state-appointed pastors and masters and saving them the labors of original thought. In consequence of this error many persons pass for normal, and indeed for highly valuable members of society, who are incurably mad; and many, on the other hand, are looked upon as mad who are geniuses...This is the art of life. You may yourself as an artist develop the game of your life and lend it animation. You may complicate and enrich it as you please. It lies in your hands. Just as madness, in a higher sense, is the beginning of all wisdom, so is schizomania the beginning of all art and all fantasy.","...for you know that soft is stronger than hard, water stronger than rock, love stronger than force.\\" Vesadeva to Siddartha","The bourgeois prefers comfort to pleasure, convenience to liberty, and a pleasant temperature to the deathly inner consuming fire","StagesAs every flower fades and as all youthDeparts, so life at every stage,So every virtue, so our grasp of truth,Blooms in its day and may not last forever.Since life may summon us at every ageBe ready, heart, for parting, new endeavor,Be ready bravely and without remorseTo find new light that old ties cannot give.In all beginnings dwells a magic forceFor guarding us and helping us to live.Serenely let us move to distant placesAnd let no sentiments of home detain us.The Cosmic Spirit seeks not to restrain usBut lifts us stage by stage to wider spaces.If we accept a home of our own making,Familiar habit makes for indolence.We must prepare for parting and leave-takingOr else remain the slaves of permanence.Even the hour of our death may sendUs speeding on to fresh and newer spaces,And life may summon us to newer races.So be it, heart: bid farewell without end.","Now true humor begins when a man ceases to take himself seriously.","Within Siddhartha there slowly grew and ripened the knowledge of what wisdom really was and the goal of his long seeking. It was nothing but a preparation of the soul, a capacity, a secret art of thinking, feeling and breathing thoughts of unity at every moment of life.","For me, trees have always been the most penetrating preachers. I revere them when they live in tribes and families, in forests and groves. And even more I revere them when they stand alone. They are like lonely persons. Not like hermits who have stolen away out of some weakness, but like great, solitary men, like Beethoven and Nietzsche. In their highest boughs the world rustles, their roots rest in infinity; but they do not lose themselves there, they struggle with all the force of their lives for one thing only: to fulfil themselves according to their own laws, to build up their own form, to represent themselves. Nothing is holier, nothing is more exemplary than a beautiful, strong tree. When a tree is cut down and reveals its naked death-wound to the sun, one can read its whole history in the luminous, inscribed disk of its trunk: in the rings of its years, its scars, all the struggle, all the suffering, all the sickness, all the happiness and prosperity stand truly written, the narrow years and the luxurious years, the attacks withstood, the storms endured. And every young farmboy knows that the hardest and noblest wood has the narrowest rings, that high on the mountains and in continuing danger the most indestructible, the strongest, the ideal trees grow.","... the river is everywhere at once, at the source and at the mouth, at the waterfall, at the ferry, at the rapids, in the sea, in the mountains, everywhere at once, and that there is only the present time for it, not the shadow of the past, not the shadow of the future.","I would traverse not once more, but often the hell of my inner being. One day I would be a better hand at the game. One day I would learn how to laugh. Pablo was waiting for me, and Mozart too.","Teachers dread nothing so much as unusual characteristics in precocious boys during the initial stages of their adolescence. A certain streak of genius makes an ominous impression on them, for there exists a deep gulf between genius and the teaching profession. Anyone with a touch of genius seems to his teachers a freak from the very first. As far as teachers are concerned, they define young geniuses as those who are bad, disrespectful, smoke at fourteen, fall in love at fifteen, can be found at sixteen hanging out in bars, read forbidden books, write scandalous essays, occasionally stare down a teacher in class, are marked in the attendance book as rebels, and are budding candidates for room-arrest. A schoolmaster will prefer to have a couple of dumbheads in his class than a single genius, and if you regard it objectively, he is of course right. His task is not to produce extravagant intellects but good Latinists, arithmeticians and sober decent folk. The question of who suffers more acutely at the other\'s hands - the teacher at the boy\'s, or vice versa - who is more of a tyrant, more of a tormentor, and who profanes parts of the other\'s soul, student or teacher, is something you cannot examine without remembering your own youth in anger and shame. yet that s not what concerns us here. We have the consolation that among true geniuses the wounds almost always heal. As their personalities develop, they create their art in spite of school. Once dead, and enveloped by the comfortable nimbus of remoteness, they are paraded by the schoolmasters before other generations of students as showpieces and noble examples. Thus teh struggle between rule and spirit repeats itself year after year from school to school. The authorities go to infinite pains to nip the few profound or more valuable intellects in the bud. And time and again the ones who are detested by their teachers are frequently punished, the runaways and those expelled, are the ones who afterwards add to society\'s treasure. But some - and who knows how many? - waste away quiet obstinacy and finally go under.","I have no idea whether parents can be of help, and I do not blame mine. It was my own affair to come to terms with myself and to find my own way, and like most well-brought-up children, I managed it badly.Everyone goes through this crisis. For the average person this is the point when the demands of his own life come into the sharpest conflict with his environment, when the way forward has to be sought with the bitterest means at his command. Many people experience the dying and rebirth - which is our fate - only this once during their entire life. Their childhood becomes hollow and gradually collapses, everything they love abandons them and they suddenly feel surrounded by the loneliness and mortal cold of the universe. Very many are caught forever in this impasse, and for the rest of their lives cling painfully to an irrevocable past, the dream of the lost paradise - which is the worst and most ruthless of dreams.","I believe . . . that the petal of a flower or a tiny worm on the path says far more, contains far more than all the books in the library. One cannot say very much with mere letters and words. Sometimes I\'ll be writing a Greek letter, a theta or an omega, and tilt my pen just the slightest bit; suddenly the letter has a tail and becomes a fish; in a second it evokes all the streams and rivers of the world, all that is cool and humid, Homer\'s sea and the waters on which Saint Peter wandered; or becomes a bird, flaps its tail, shakes out its feathers, puffs itself up, laughs, flies away. You probably don\'t appreciate letters like that, very much, do you, Narcissus? But I say: with them God wrote the world.","The world is not imperfect or slowly evolving along a path to perfection. No, it is perfect at every moment, every sin already carries grace in it.","If you need something desperately and find it, this is not an accident; your own craving and compulsion leads you to it.","At the first kiss I felt something melt inside me that hurt in an exquisite way. All my longings, all my dreams and sweet anguish, All the secrets that slept deep within me came awake, Everything was transformed and enchanted, everything made sense.","The things we see,\\" Pistorius said softly, \\"are the same things that are within us. There is no reality except the one contained within us. That is why so many people live such an unreal life. They take the images outside them for reality and never allow the world within to assert itself. You can be happy that way. But once you know the other interpretation you no longer have the choice of following the crowd. Sinclair, the majority\'s path is an easy one, ours is difficult.","If only there were a dogma to believe in. Everything is contradictory, everything is tangential; there are no certainties anywhere. Everything can be interpreted one way and then again interpreted in the opposite sense. The whole of world history can be explained as development and progress and can also be seen as nothing but decadence and meaninglessness. Isn\'t there any truth? Is there no real and valid doctrine?\\" Joseph Knect said to his Music Master \\"there is truth, my boy. But the doctrine you desire, absolute perfect dogma that alone provides wisdom, does not exist. Nor should you long for a perfect doctrine, my friend rather, you should long for perfection in yourself. The deity is within you, not in ideas and books. Truth is lived not taught","You love nobody. Is that not true?\\"\\"Maybe,\\" said Siddhartha wearily. \\"I am like you. You cannot love either, otherwise how could you practice love as an art? Perhaps people like us cannot love. Ordinary people can - that is their secret.","(We) consist of everything the world consists of, each of us, and just as our body contains the genealogical table of evolution as far back as the fish and even much further, so we bear everything in our soul that once was alive in the soul of men. Every god and devil that ever existed, be it among the Greeks, Chinese, or Zulus, are within us, exist as latent possibilities, as wishes, as alternatives. If the human race were to vanish from the face of the earth save for one halfway talented child that had received no education, this child would rediscover the entire course of evolution, it would be capable of producing everything once more, gods and demons, paradises, commandments, the Old and New Testament.","Among the many worlds which man did not receive as a gift of nature, but which he created with his own mind, the world of books is the greatest. Every child, scrawling his first letters on his slate and attempting to read for the first time, in so doing, enters an artificial and complicated world; to know the laws and rules of this world completely and to practice them perfectly, no single human life is long enough. Without words, without writing, and without books there would be no history, there could be no concept of humanity. And if anyone wants to try to enclose in a small space in a single house or single room, the history of the human spirit and to make it his own, he can only do this in the form of a collection of books.","Hewas taught by the river. Incessantly, he learned from it. Most of all,he learned from it to listen, to pay close attention with a quiet heart,with a waiting, opened soul, without passion, without a wish, withoutjudgement, without an opinion.","I am a star in the firmamentthat observe the world, despises the worldand consumed in its heat.I am the sea by night in a stormthe sea shouting that accumulates new sinsand to the ancient makes recompense.I am exiled from your worldof pride polite, by pride defrauded,I am the king without crown.I am the passion without wordswithout stones of the hearth, without weapons in the war,is my same force that make me sick","It is good,\\" he thought \\"to taste for yourself everything you need to know. That worldly pleasures and wealth are not good things, I learned even as a child. I knew it for a long time, but only now have I experienced it. And now I know it, I know it not only because I remember hearing it, but with my eyes, with my heart, with my stomach. And it is good for me to know it!","The world, my friend Govinda, is not imperfect or confined at a point somewhere along a gradual pathway toward perfection. No, it is perfect at every moment.","Tegularius was a willful, moody person who refused to fit into his society. Every so often he would display the liveliness of his intellect. When highly stimulated he could be entrancing; his mordant wit sparkled and he overwhelmed everyone with the audacity and richness of his sometimes somber inspirations. But basically he was incurable, for he did not want to be cured; he cared nothing for co-ordination and a place in the scheme of things. He loved nothing but his freedom, his perpetual student status, and preferred spending his whole life as the unpredictable and obstinate loner, the gifted fool and nihilist, to following the path of subordination to the hierarchy and thus attaining peace. He cared nothing for peace, had no regard for the hierarchy, hardly minded reproof and isolation. Certainly he was a most inconvenient and indigestible component in a community whose idea was harmony and orderliness. But because of this very troublesomeness and indigestibility he was, in the midst of such a limpid and prearranged little world, a constant source of vital unrest, a reproach, an admonition and warning, a spur to new, bold, forbidden, intrepid ideas, an unruly, stubborn sheep in the herd.","As a body everyone is single, as a soul never","It is possible for one never to transgress a single law and still be a bastard.","You have a picture of life within you, a faith, a challenge, and you were ready for deeds and sufferings and sacrifices, and then you became aware by degrees that the world asked no deeds and no sacrifices of you whatever, and that life is no poem of heroism with heroic parts to play and so on, but a comfortable room where people are quite content with eating and drinking, coffee and knitting, cards and wireless. And whoever wants more and has got it in him--the heroic and the beautiful, and the reverence for the great poets or for the saints--is a fool and a Don Quixote. Good. And it has been just the same for me, my friend. I was a gifted girl. I was meant to live up to a high standard, to expect much of myself and do great things. I could have played a great part. I could have been the wife of a king, the beloved of a revolutionary, the sister of a genius, the mother of a martyr. And life has allowed me just this, to be a courtesan of fairly good taste, and even that has been hard enough. That is how things have gone with me. For a while I was inconsolable and for a long time I put the blame on myself. Life, thought I, must in the end be in the right, and if life scorned my beautiful dreams, so I argued, it was my dreams that were stupid and wrong headed. But that did not help me at all. And as I had good eyes and ears and was a little inquisitive too, I took a good look at this so-called life and at my neighbors and acquaintances, fifty or so of them and their destinies, and then I saw you. And I knew that my dreams had been right a thousand times over, just as yours had been. It was life and reality that were wrong. It was as little right that a woman like me should have no other choice than to grow old in poverty and in a senseless way at a typewriter in the pay of a money-maker, or to marry such a man for his money\'s sake, or to become some kind of drudge, as for a man like you to be forced in his loneliness and despair to have recourse to a razor. Perhaps the trouble with me was more material and moral and with you more spiritual--but it was the same road. Do you think I can\'t understand your horror of the fox trot, your dislike of bars and dancing floors, your loathing of jazz and the rest of it? I understand it only too well, and your dislike of politics as well, your despondence over the chatter and irresponsible antics of the parties and the press, your despair over the war, the one that has been and the one that is to be, over all that people nowadays think, read and build, over the music they play, the celebrations they hold, the education they carry on. You are right, Steppenwolf, right a thousand times over, and yet you must go to the wall. You are much too exacting and hungry for this simple, easygoing and easily contented world of today. You have a dimension too many. Whoever wants to live and enjoy his life today must not be like you and me. Whoever wants music instead of noise, joy instead of pleasure, soul instead of gold, creative work instead of business, passion instead of foolery, finds no home in this trivial world of ours--","-Yo te gusto- continu\xf3 ella-, por el motivo que ya te he dicho; he roto tu soledad, te he recogido precisamente ante la puerta del infierno y te he despertado de nuevo.

I knew that all the hundred thousand pieces of life\'s game were in my pocket. A glimpse of its meaning had stirred my reason and I was determined to begin the game afresh. I would sample its tortures once more and shudder again at its senselessness. I would traverse not once more, but often, the hell of my inner being.","At the end of that class Demian said to me thoughtfully: \\"There\u2019s something I don\u2019t like about this story, Sinclair. Why don\u2019t you read it once more and give it the acid test? There\u2019s something about it that doesn\u2019t taste right. I mean the business with the two thieves. The three crosses standing next to each other on the hill are almost impressive, to be sure. But now comes this sentimental little treatise about the good thief. At first he was a thorough scoundrel, had committed all those awful things and God knows what else, and now he dissolves in tears and celebrates such a tearful feast of self-improvement and remorse! What\u2019s the sense of repenting if you\u2019re two steps from the grave? I ask you. Once again, it\u2019s nothing but a priest\u2019s fairy tale, saccharine and dishonest, touched up with sentimentality and given a high edifying background. If you had to pick a friend from between the two thieves or decide which one you\u2019d rather trust, you most certainly wouldn\u2019t choose the sniveling convert. No, the other fellow, he\u2019s a man of character. He doesn\u2019t give a hoot for \u2018conversion\u2019, which to a man in his position can\u2019t be anything but a pretty speech. He follows his destiny to it\u2019s appointed end and does not turn coward and forswear the devil, who has aided and abetted him until then. He has character, and people with character tend to receive the short end of the stick in biblical stories. Perhaps he\u2019s even a descendant of Cain. Don\u2019t you agree?\\"I was dismayed. Until now I had felt completely at home in the story of the Crucifixion. Now I saw for the first time with how little individuality, with how little power of imagination I had listened to it and read it. Still, Demian\u2019s new concept seemed vaguely sinister and threatened to topple beliefs on whose continued existence I felt I simply had to insist. No, one could not make light of everything, especially not of the most Sacred matters.As usual he noticed my resistance even before I had said anything.\\"I know,\\" he said in a resigned tone of voice, \\"it\u2019s the same old story: don\u2019t take these stories seriously! But I have to tell you something: this is one of the very places that reveals the poverty of this religion most distinctly. The point is that this God of both Old and New Testaments is certainly an extraordinary figure but not what he purports to represent. He is all that is good, noble, fatherly, beautiful, elevated, sentimental\u2014true! But the world consists of something else besides. And what is left over is ascribed to the devil, this entire slice of world, this entire half is hushed up. In exactly the same way they praise God as the father of all life but simply refuse to say a word about our sexual life on which it\u2019s all based, describing it whenever possible as sinful, the work of the devil. I have no objection to worshiping this God Jehovah, far from it. But I mean we ought to consider everything sacred, the entire world, not merely this artificially separated half! Thus alongside the divine service we should also have a service for the devil. I feel that would be right. Otherwise you must create for yourself a God that contains the devil too and in front of which you needn\u2019t close your eyes when the most natural things in the world take place.","There are numerous ways in which God can make us lonely and lead us back to ourselves. This is the way He dealt with me at the time. It was like a bad dream.","No permanence is ours; we are a waveThat flows to fit whatever form it finds:Through night or day, cathedral or the caveWe pass forever, craving form that binds.","Should we be mindful of dreams?\\" Joseph asked. \\"Can we interpret them?\\"The Master looked into his eyes and said tersely: \\"We should be mindful of everything, for we can interpret everything.","Wenn ich trotzdem wei\xdf, was Liebe ist, so ist es deinetwegen.

It might start in utter sensuality and lead to total abstraction; then again it might originate in pure concept and end in bleeding flesh. Any work of art that was truly sublime, not just a good juggler\'s trick; that was filled with the eternal secret, like the master\'s madonna; every obviously genuine work of art had this dangerous, smiling double face, was male-female, a merging of instinct and pure spirituality.","There\'s no reality except the one contained within us.

We fear death, we shudder at life\'s instability, we grieve to see the flowers wilt again and again, and the leaves fall, and in our hearts we know that we, too, as transitory and will soon disappear. When artists create pictures and thinkers search for laws and formulate thoughts, it is in order to salvage something from the great dance of death, to make something that lasts longer than we do.","When a tree is polled, it will sprout new shoots nearer its roots. A soul that is ruined in the bud will frequently return to the springtime of its beginnings and its promise-filled childhood, as though it could discover new hopes there and retie the broken threads of life.

Now the bourgeois treasures nothing more highly than the self (rudimentary as his may be). And so at the cost of intensity he achieves his own preservation and security. His harvest is a quiet mind which he prefers to being possessed by God, as he does comfort to pleasure, convenience to liberty, and a pleasant temperature to that deathly inner consuming fire. The bourgeois is consequently by nature a creature of weak impulses, anxious, fearful of giving himself away and easy to rule. Therefore, he has substituted majority for power, law for force, and the polling booth for responsibility.","We kill at every step, not only in wars, riots and executions.We kill when we close our eyes to poverty, suffering and shame.In the same way all disrespect for life, all hard-heartedness,all indifference, all contempt is nothing else than killing.","Einsamkeit ist Unabh\xe4ngigkeit, ich hatte sie mir gew\xfcnscht und mir erworben in langen Jahren.

But those who do so inevitably discover that these struggles bring them into conflict with the normal life of average people and the traditional values and bourgeois conventions that they uphold. A personality is the product of a clash between two opposing forces: the urge to create a life of one\'s own and the insistence by the world around us that we conform. Nobody can develop a personality unless he undergoes revolutionary experiences. The extent of those experiences differs, of course, from person to person, as does the capacity to lead a life that is truly personal and unique.","Yes Siddhartha,\' he said. \'Is this what you mean: that the river is in all places at once, at its source and where it flows into the sea, at the waterfall, at the ferry, at the rapids, in the ocean, in the mountains, everywhere at once, so for the river there is only the present moment and not the shadow of the future?\'\'It is,\' Siddhartha said.\'And once I learned this I considered my life, and it too was a river, and the boy Siddhartha was separated from the man Siddhartha and the graybeard Siddhartha only by shadows, not by real things. ... Nothing was, nothing will be; everything is, everything has being and presence.","I experienced by observing my own body and my own soul that I sorely needed sin, sorely needed concupiscence, needed greed, vanity, and the most shameful despair to learn to stop resisting, to learn to love the world and stop comparing it to some world I only wished for and imagined, some sort of perfection I myself had dreamed up, but instead to let it be as it was and to love it and be happy to belong to it.","He saw mankind going through life in a childlike manner... which he loved but also despised.... He saw them toiling, saw them suffering, and becoming gray for the sake of things which seemed to him to be entirely unworthy of this price, for money, for little pleasures, for being slightly honoured....","This little theater of mine has as many doors into as many boxes as you please, ten or a hundred thousand, and behind each door exactly what you seek awaits you. It is a pretty cabinet of pictures, my dear friend; but it would be quite useless to go through it as you are. You would be checked and blinded by it at every turn by what you are pleased to call your personality. You have no doubt guessed long since that the conquest of time and the escape from reality, or however else it may be that you choose to describe your longing, means simply the wish to be relieved of your so-called personality. That is the prison where you lie.","No road will bring us together.\\"\\"Don\'t speak like that.\\"\\"I\'m serious. We are not meant to come together, not any more than sun and moon were meant to come together, or sea and land. We are sun and moon, dear friend; we are sea and land. It is not our purpose to become each other; it is to recognize each other, to learn to see the other and honor him for what he is: each the other\'s opposite and complement.","Der Vogel k\xe4mpft sich aus dem Ei. Das Ei ist die Welt. Wer geboren werden will, muss eine Welt zerst\xf6ren.","Every age, every culture, every custom and tradition has its own character, its own weakness and its own strength, its beauties and ugliness; accepts certain sufferings as matters of course, puts up patiently with certain evils. Human life is reduced to real suffering, real hell, only when two ages, two cultures and religions overlap. A man of the Classical Age who had to live in medieval times would suffocate miserably just as a savage does in the midst of our civilization. Now there are times when a whole generation is caught in this way between two ages, two modes of life, with the consequence that it loses all power to understand itself and has no standard, no security, no simple acquiescence. Naturally, everyone does not feel this equally strongly. A nature such as Nietzsche\u2019s had to suffer our present ills more than a generation in advance. What he had to go through alone and misunderstood, thousands suffer today.","Obedient to no man, dependent only on weather and season, without a goal before them or a roof above them, owning nothing, open to every whim of fate, the homeless wanderers lead their childlike, brave, shabby existence. They are the sons of Adam, who was driven out of Paradise; the brothers of the animals, of innocence. Out of heaven\'s hand they accept what is given them from moment to moment: sun, rain, fog, snow, warmth, cold, comfort, and hardship; time does not exist for them and neither does history, or ambition, or that bizarre idol called progress and evolution, in which houseowners believe so desperately. A wayfarer may be delicate or crude, artful or awkward, brave or cowardly\u2014he is always a child at heart, living in the first day of creation, before the beginning of the history of the world, his life always guided by a few simple instincts and needs. He may be intelligent or stupid; he may be deeply aware of the fleeting fragility of all living things, of how pettily and fearfully each living creature carries its bit of warm blood through the glaciers of cosmic space, or he may merely follow the commands of his poor stomach with childlike greed\u2014he is always the opponent, the deadly enemy of the established proprietor, who hates him, despises him, or fears him, because he does not wish to be reminded that all existence is transitory, that life is constantly wilting, that merciless icy death fills the cosmos all around.","The opposite of every truth is just as true! That\'s like this: any truth can only be expressed and put into words when it is one-sided. Everything is one-sided which can be thought with thoughts and said with words, it\'s all one-sided, all just one half, all lacks completeness, roundness, oneness. When the exalted Gotama spoke in his teachings of the world, he had to divide it into Sansara and Nirvana, into deception and truth, into suffering and salvation. It cannot be done differently, there is no other way for him who wants to teach. But the world itself, what exists around us and inside of us, is never one-sided. A person or an act is never entirely Sansara or entirely Nirvana, a person is never entirely holy or entirely sinful. It does really seem like this, because we are subject to deception, as if time was something real. Time is not real, Govinda, I have experienced this often and often again. And if time is not real, then the gap which seems to be between the world and the eternity, between suffering and blissfulness, between evil and good, is also a deception.","I like listening to music, but only the kind you play, absolute music, the kind that makes you feel that someone is rattling at the doors if heaven and hell. I like music very much, I think, because it\'s so unconcerned with morality.","You know quite well, deep within you, that there is only a single magic, a single power, a single salvation, & that is called loving.","Even the wolf has two, and more than two, souls in his wolf\'s breast, and he who desires to be a wolf falls into the same forgetfulness as the man who sings: \\"If I could be a child once more!\\" He who sentimentally sings of blessed childhood is thinking of the return to nature and innocence and the origin of things, and has quite forgotten that these blessed children are beset with conflict and complexities and capable of all suffering.There is, in fact, no way back either to the wolf or to the child. From the very start there is no innocence and no singleness. Every created thing, even the simplest, is already guilty, alreadymultiple. It has been thrown into the muddy stream of being and may never more swim back again to its source. The way to innocence, to the uncreated and to God leads on, not back, not back to the wolf or to the child, but ever further into sin, ever deeper into human life. Nor will suicide really solve your problem, unhappy Steppenwolf. You will, instead, embark on the longer and wearier and harder road of life. You will have to multiply many times your two-fold being and complicate your complexities still further. Instead of narrowing your world and simplifying your soul, you will have to absorb more and more of the world and at last take all of it up in your painfully expanded soul, if you are ever to find peace.","Sinclair, your love is attracted to me. Once it begins to attract me, i will come. I will not make a gift of myself, I must be won.","Once he said to her: \'You are like me; you are different from other people. You are Kamala and no one else, and within you there is a stillness and sanctuary to which you can retreat any time and be yourself, just as I can. Few people have that capacity and yet everyone could have it.","If a beautiful thing were to remain beautiful for all eternity, I\'d be glad, but all the same Id look at it with a colder eye.

Really, we ought all to be such looking-glasses to each other and answer and correspond to each other.","Men of dreams, the lovers and the poets, are better in most things than the men of my sort; the men of intellect. You take your being from your mothers. You live to the full: it is given you to love with your whole strength, to know and taste the whole of life. We thinkers, though often we seem to rule you, cannot live with half your joy and full reality. Ours is a thin and arid life, but the fullness of being is yours; yours the sap of the fruit, the garden of lovers, the joyous pleasaunces of beauty. Your home is the earth, ours the idea of it. Your danger is to be drowned in the world of sense, ours to gasp for breath in airless space. You are a poet, I a thinker. You sleep on your mother\'s breast, I watch in the wilderness.

The tree does not die. It waits.","Govinda said: \\"But what you call thing, is it something real, something intrinsic? Is it not only the illusion of Maya, only image and appearance? Your stone, your tree, are they real?\\" \\"This also does not trouble me much,\\" said Siddhartha. \\"If they are illusion, then I also am illusion, and so they are always of the same nature as myself. It is that which makes them so lovable and venerable. That is why I can Love them. And here is a doctrine at which you will laugh. It seems to me, Govinda, that love is the most imortant thing in the world. It may be important tp great thinkers to examine the world, to explain an despise it. But I think it is only important to love the world, not to despise it, not for uus to hate each other, but to be able to regard the world and ourselves and all beings with love, admiration and respect.","People like you and me are quite lonely really but we still have each other, we have the secret satisfaction of being different, of rebelling, of desiring the unusual.","How I used to love the dark, sad evenings of late autumn and winter, how eagerly I imbibed their moods of loneliness and melancholy when wrapped in my cloak I strode for half the night through rain and storm, through the leafless winter landscape, lonely enough then too, but full of deep joy, and full of poetry which later I wrote down by candlelight sitting on the edge of my bed!","And these men, for whom life has no repose, live at times in their rare moments of happiness with such strength and indescribable beauty, the spray of their moment\u2019s happiness is flung so high and dazzling over the wide sea of suffering, that the light of it, spreading its radiance, touches others too with its enchantment. Thus, like a precious, fleeting foam over the sea of suffering arise all those works of art, in which a single individual lifts himself for an hour so high above his personal destiny that his happiness shines like a star and appears to all who see it as something eternal and as a happiness of their own.","Within Siddhartha there slowly grew and ripened the knowledge of what wisdom really was and the goal of his long seeking. It was nothing but a preparation of the soul, a capacity, a secret art of thinking, feeling and breathing thoughts of unity at every moment of life. This thought matured in him slowly, and it was reflected in Vasudeva\'s old childlike face: harmony, knowledge of the eternal perfection of the world, and unity.","One of the disadwantages of school and learning, he thought dreamily, was that the mind seemed to have the tendency too see and represent all things as though they were flat and had only two dimensions.

The river has taught me to listen; you will learn from it too. The river knows everything; one can learn everything from it. You have already learned from the river that it is good to strive downwards, to sink, to seek the depths.\'...Was it not a comedy, a strange and stupid thing, this repetition, this course of events in a fateful circle?...The river laughed. Yes, that was how it was. Everything that was not suffered to the end and finally concluded, recurred, and the same sorrows were undergone.","What are reason and sobriety without the knowledge of intoxication?","I have had to experience so much stupidity, so many vices, so much error, so much nausea, disillusionment and sorrow, just in order to become a child again and begin anew.","All being, it seemed, was built on opposites, on division. Man or woman, vagabond or citizen, lover or thinker \u2014 no breath could both be in and out, none could be man and wife, free and yet orderly, knowing the urge of life and the joy of intellect. Always the one paid for the other, though each was equally precious and essential.","No, I\'m not religious, I\'m sorry to say. But I was once and shall be again. There is no time now to be religious.\\"\\"No time. Does it need time to be religious?\\"\\"Oh, yes. To be religious you must have time and, even more, independence of time. You can\'t be religious in earnest and at the same time live in actual things and still take them seriously, time and money and the Od\xe9on Bar and all that.","Wisdom is not communicable. The wisdom which a wise man tries to communicate always sounds foolish... Knowledge can be communicated, but not wisdom. One can find it, live it, do wonders through it, but one cannot communicate and teach it.","Like an attack this melancholy comes from time to time. I don\'t know at what intervals, and slowly covers my sky with clouds. It begins with an unrest in the heart, with a premonition of anxiety, probably with my dreams at night. People, houses, colors, sounds that otherwise please me become dubious and seem false. Music gives me a headache. All my mail becomes upsetting and contains hidden arrows. At such times, having to converse with people is torture and immediately leads to scenes... Anger, suffering, and complaints are directed at everything, at people, at animals, at the weather, at God, at the paper in the book one is reading, at the material of the very clothing one has on. But anger, impatience, complaints and hatred have no effect on things and are deflected from everything, back to myself.","After so many years of foolishness, you have once again had an idea, have done something, have heard the bird in your chest singing and have followed it.","The world was beautiful when looked at in this way\u2014without any seeking, so simple, so childlike.","Novelists when they write novels tend to take an almost godlike attitude toward their subject, pretending to a total comprehension of the story, a man\'s life, which they can therefore recount as God Himself might, nothing standing between them and the naked truth, the entire story meaningful in every detail. I am as little able to do this as the novelist is, even though my story is more important to me than any novelist\'s is to him - for this is my story; it is the story of a man, not of an invented, or possible, or idealized, or otherwise absent figure, but of a unique being of flesh and blood, Yet, what a real living human being is made of seems to be less understood today than at any time before, and men - each one of whom represents a unique and valuable experiment on the part of nature - are therefore shot wholesale nowadays. If we were not something more than unique human beings, if each one of us could really be done away with once and for all by a single bullet, storytelling would lose all purpose. But every man is more than just himself; he also represents the unique, the very special and always significant and remarkable point at which the world\'s phenomena intersect, only once in this way and never again. That is why every man\'s story is important, eternal, sacred; that is why every man, as long as he lives and fulfills the will of nature, is wondrous, and worthy of every consideration. In each individual the spirit has become flesh, in each man the creation suffers, within each one a redeemer is nailed to the cross.","There\'s something to walking with autumnal thoughts through the evening fog.

It is a longing for home, for a memory of the mother, for new metaphors for life. It leads home.","I thought of nothing but her. I expected everything from her.

It is not possible for any person to see how far another one has already progressed on his path; in the robber and dice-gambler, the Buddha is waiting; in the Brahman, the robber is waiting. In deep meditation, there is the possibility to put time out of existence, to see all life which was, is, and will be as if it was simultaneous, and there everything is good, everything is perfect, everything is Brahman. Therefore, I see whatever exists as good, death is to me like life, sin like holiness, wisdom like foolishness, everything has to be as it is, everything only requires my consent, only my willingness, my loving agreement, to be good for me, to do nothing but work for my benefit, to be unable to ever harm me. I have experienced on my body and on my soul that I needed sin very much, I needed lust, the desire for possessions, vanity, and needed the most shameful despair, in order to learn how to give up all resistance, in order to learn how to love the world, in order to stop comparing it to some world I wished, I imagined, some kind of perfection I had made up, but to leave it as it is and to love it and to enjoy being a part of it.","\u0644\u0645 \u064a\u0645\u0646\u062d\u0648\u0627 \u0623\u0646\u0641\u0633\u0647\u0645 \u0648\u0642\u062a\u0627 \u0648 \u0644\u0627 \u062c\u0647\u062f\u0627 \u0644\u064a\u0642\u0648\u0648\u0627 \u0623\u0646\u0641\u0633\u0647\u0645 \u0623\u0645\u0627\u0645 \u0627\u0644\u062e\u0648\u0641 \u0648 \u0644\u064a\u0642\u0647\u0631\u0648\u0627 \u0641\u064a \u0623\u0646\u0641\u0633\u0647\u0645 \u0627\u0644\u062e\u0648\u0641 \u0645\u0646 \u0627\u0644\u0645\u0648\u062a, \u0628\u0644 \u0633\u0627\u0631\u0648\u0627 \u0628\u062d\u064a\u0627\u062a\u0647\u0645 \u0645\u0631\u062a\u0639\u062f\u064a\u0646 \u0644\u0627 \u064a\u0624\u0645\u0646\u0648\u0646 \u0628\u063a\u062f","For there is not a single human being, not even the primitive Negro, not even the idiot, who is so conveniently simple that his being can be explained as the sum of two or three principal elements; and to explain so complex a man as Harry by the artless division into wolf and man is a hopelessly childish attempt.

It makes its unappetizing tone-slime of the most magic orchestral music. Everywhere it obtrudes its mechanism, its activity, its dreary exigencies and vanity between the ideal and the real, between orchestra and ear. All life is so, my child, and we must let it be so: and, if we are not asses, laugh at it. It little becomes people like you to be critics of radio or of life either. Better learn to listen first! Learn what is to be taken seriously and laugh at the rest.","It was fortunate that love did not need words; or else it would be full of misunderstanding and foolishness.","Times of terror and the deepest misery may arrive, but if there is to be any happiness in this misery it can only be a spiritual happiness, related to the past in the rescue of the culture of early ages and to the future in a serene and indefatigable championship of the spirit in a time which would otherwise completely swallow up the material.","Some day you will think of what I am going to say to you now: our friendship has no other purpose, no other reason, than to show you how utterly unlike me you are.","It is extremely beautiful to belong to a woman, to give yourself.

But to love a woman, you see, to abandon yourself to her, to absorb her completely and feel absorbed by her, that is not what you call \u2018being in love,\u2019 which you mock a little. For me it is the road to life, the way toward the meaning of life.","All children, as long as they still live in the mystery, are continuously occupied in their souls with the only thing that is important, which is themselves and their enigmatic relationship with the world around them. Seekers and wise people return to these preoccupations as they mature. Most people, however, forget and leave forever this inner world of the truly significant very early in their lives. Like lost souls they wander about for their entire lives in the multicolored maze of worries, wishes, and goals, none of which dwells in their innermost being and none of which leads them to their innermost core and home.","What is the world doing?

Sometimes everything is so completely uncertain! There are days when I am convinced that no man on earth can recognize certain moods of air and cloud, certain tones of color, certain fragrances and movements of moisture as finely, as exactly, and as truly as I can, with my old, nervous sense of poet and wanderer. And then again, as today, it can be doubtful to me whether I have seen, heard, and smelled anything after all, whether everything that I took to be true is not merely an image cast outward, the image of my inner life.","All I wanted to do was live the life that was inside me, trying to get out.

No, by no means. When a child\'s talent which he has sought to kindle suddenly bursts forth, when the boy puts aside his wooden sword, slingshot, bow-and-arrow and other childish games, when he begins to forge ahead, when the seriousness of the work begins to transform the rough-neck into a delicate, serious and an almost ascetic creature, when his face takes on an intelligent, deeper and more purposeful expression - then a teacher\'s heart laughs with happiness and pride. It is his duty and responsibility to control the raw energies and desires of his charges and replace them with calmer, more moderate ideals. What would many happy citizens and trustworthy officials have become but unruly, stormy innovators and dreamers of useless dreams, if not for the effort of their schools? In young beings there is something wild, ungovernable, uncultured which first has to be tamed. It is like a dangerous flame that has to be controlled or it will destroy. Natural man is unpredictable, opaque, dangerous, like a torrent cascading out of uncharted mountains. At the start, his soul is a jungle without paths or order. And, like a jungle, it must first be cleared and its growth thwarted. Thus it is the school\'s task to subdue and control man with force and make him a useful member of society, to kindle those qualities in him whose development will bring him to triumphant completion.","Siddhartha gave his garments to a poor Brahman in the street. He worenothing more than the loincloth and the earth-coloured, unsown cloak.He ate only once a day, and never something cooked. He fasted forfifteen days. He fasted for twenty-eight days. The flesh waned fromhis thighs and cheeks. Feverish dreams flickered from his enlargedeyes, long nails grew slowly on his parched fingers and a dry, shaggybeard grew on his chin. His glance turned to icy when he encounteredwomen; his mouth twitched with contempt, when he walked through a cityof nicely dressed people. He saw merchants trading, princes hunting,mourners wailing for their dead, whores offering themselves, physicianstrying to help the sick, priests determining the most suitable day forseeding, lovers loving, mothers nursing their children--and all of thiswas not worthy of one look from his eye, it all lied, it all stank,it all stank of lies, it all pretended to be meaningful and joyful andbeautiful, and it all was just concealed putrefaction. The world tastedbitter. Life was torture.A goal stood before Siddhartha, a single goal: to become empty, empty ofthirst, empty of wishing, empty of dreams, empty of joy and sorrow.Dead to himself, not to be a self any more, to find tranquility with anemptied heard, to be open to miracles in unselfish thoughts, that washis goal. Once all of my self was overcome and had died, once everydesire and every urge was silent in the heart, then the ultimate partof me had to awake, the innermost of my being, which is no longer myself, the great secret.","The drunkard does indeed find escape, he does indeed find short respite and rest, but he returns from the illusion and finds everything as it was before. He has not grown wiser, he has not gained knowledge, he has not climbed any higher.","En estos momentos tuve una certeza fulminante: cada uno ten\xeda una \u201cmisi\xf3n, pero \xe9sta no pod\xeda ser elegida, definida, administrada a voluntad.

No exist\xeda ning\xfan deber, ninguno, para el hombre consciente, excepto el de buscarse a s\xed mismo, afirmarse en su interior, tantear un camino hacia adelante sin preocuparse de la meta a que pudiera conducir.

Yo hab\xeda jugado a menudo con im\xe1genes del futuro y so\xf1ado con papeles que pudieran estar destinados de poeta quiz\xe1s, de profeta, de pintor o de cualquier otra cosa.

Seeking means having a goal. Finding means being free, being open, having no goal. You, Venerable One, are perhaps indeed a seeker, for, striving to reach your goal, you overlook many things that lie close before your eyes.","Of all the conceptions of pure bliss that people and poets have dreamed of, listening to the harmony of the spheres always seemed to me the highest and most intense. That is where my dearest and brightest dreams have ranged - to hear for the duration of a heartbeat the universe and the totality of life in its mysterious innate harmony. Alas, how is it that life can be so confusing and out of tune and false, how can there be lies, evil, envy and hate among people, when the shortest song and most simple piece of music preach that heaven is revealed in the purity, harmony and interplay of clearly sounded notes. And how can I upbraid people and grow angry when I myself, with all the good will in the world have been unable to make song and sweet music out of my life?","Your life will not be flat and dull eventhough you know that your war will never be victorious. It is far flatter, Harry, to fight for something goodand ideal and to know all the time that you are bound to attain it. Are ideals attainable? Do we live toabolish death? No--we live to fear it and then again to love it, and just for death\'s sake it is that our sparkof life glows for an hour now and then so brightly.","Never again!\\" commanded his will. \\"Again!

But if you were to die ten times for him, you would not alter his destiny in the slightest.","Novalis and Dostoyevsky, awaited me just as do the mother, or the wife, the children, maids, dogs and cats in the case of more sensible people.","How I hated myself, thwarted, poisoned and tortured myself, made myself old and ugly.

A wolf of the Steppes that had lost its way and strayed into the towns and the life of the herd, a more striking image could not be found for his shy loneliness, his savagery, his restlessness, his homesickness, his homelessness.","How deaf and stupid have I been!\\" he thought, walking swiftly along.\\"When someone reads a text, wants to discover its meaning, he will notscorn the symbols and letters and call them deceptions, coincidence, andworthless hull, but he will read them, he will study and love them, letterby letter.

No, this is over, I have awakened, I have in-deed awakened and have not been born before this very day.","Ich wollte ja nichts als das zu leben versuchen, was von selber aus mir heraus wollte.

Hermine had me lead, adapting herself as softly and lightly as the leaf of a flower, and with her, too, I now experienced all these delights that now advanced and now took wing. She, too, now exhaled the perfume of woman and love, and her dancing, too, sang with intimate tenderness the lovely and enchanting song of sex.","El p\xe1jaro rompe el cascar\xf3n.

The Glass Bead Game is thus a mode of playing with the total contents and values of our culture; it plays with them as, say, in the great age of the arts a painter might have played with the colours on his palette.","I would lie for hours by the window gazing down upon the black lake and up at the mountains silhouetted against the wan sky, with stars suspended above. Then a fearfully sweet, overpowering emotion would take hold of me\u2014as though all the nighttime beauty looked at me accusingly, stars and mountain and lake longing for someone who understood the beauty and agony of their mute existence, who could express it for them, as though I were the one meant to do this and as though my true calling were to give expression to inarticulate nature in poems.","There is much that I could say about the happy and tender incidents in my childhood days, the sense of security which I enjoyed with my parents, my childish affections and carefree, irresponsible existence in a gentle and affectionate ambience. But my interest is reserved for the steps that I took in my life towards self-realization. All the pleasant points of repose, islands of happiness, paradises whose magic was not unknown to me can remain, as far as I am concerned, in the enchanted distance; for it is not a world that I have any particular desire to re-enter.","Credo che si possa tracciare una frontiera molto precisa tra la giovinezza e la vecchiaia: la giovinezza termina con l\u2019egoismo, la vecchiaia inizia con il vivere per gli altri. Io la vedo cos\xec: nella vita dei giovani c\u2019\xe8 molta gioia e molta sofferenza, perch\xe9 vivono solo per s\xe9. Allora ogni desiderio e ogni idea diventano importanti; si assapora ogni gioia, ma anche ogni dolore e molti, quando si accorgono che i loro desideri sono irrealizzabili, subito gettano via l\u2019intera vita. Questo \xe8 l\u2019atteggiamento dei giovani. Per la maggior parte delle persone per\xf2, arriva un momento in cui tutto questo cambia, in cui cominciano a vivere pi\xf9 per gli altri che per se stessi.

I need it, and I refuse to give it up... That\u2019s my fatal flaw.","The morality of artists is replaced by aesthetics.","He lived in this dream world more than in the real one. The real world: classroom, courtyard, library, dormitory, and chapel were only the surface, a quivering film over the dream-filled super-real world of images.","A wild longing for strong emotions and sensations seethes in me, a rage against this toneless, flat, normal and sterile life. I have a mad impulse to smash something, a warehouse perhaps, or a cathedral, or myself, to committ outrages\u2026","No matter how inflexibly the world was clamoring for war and heroism, honor and other outmoded ideals, no matter how remote and unlikely every voice that apparently spoke up for humanity sounded, all of that was merely superficial, just as the question of the external and political aims of the war remained superficial. Deep down, something was evolving. Something like a new humanity. Because I could see people, and a number of them died alongside me, who had gained the new emotional insight that hatred and rage, killing and destroying, were not linked to the specific objects if that rage. No, the objects, just like the aims, were completely accidental. Those primal feelings, even the wildest of them, weren\'t directed against the enemy; their bloody results were merely an outward materialization of people\'s inner life, the split within their souls, which desired to rage and kill, destroy and die, so that they could be reborn.","And was it not perhaps more childlike and human to lead a Goldmund-life, more courageous, more noble perhaps in the end to abandon oneself to the cruel stream of reality, to chaos, to commit sins and accept their bitter consequences rather than live a clean life with washed hands outside the world, laying out a lonely harmonious thought-garden, strolling sinlessly among one\'s sheltered flower beds. Perhaps it was harder, braver and nobler to wander through forests and along the highways with torn shoes, to suffer sun and rain, hunger and need, to play with the joys of the senses and pay for them with suffering. At any rate, Goldmund had shown him that a man destined for high things can dip into the lowest depths of the bloody, drunken chaos of life, and soil himself with much dust and blood, without becoming small and common, without killing the divine spark within himself, that he can err through the thickest darkness without extinguishing the divine light and the creative force inside the shrine of his soul.","By degrees, however, he fashioned for himself out of this tendency a philosophy that was actually serviceable to life. He gained strength through familiarity with the thought that the emergency exit stood always open, and became curious, too, to taste his suffering to the dregs. If it went too badly with him he could feel sometimes with a grim malicious pleasure: \\"I am curious to see all the same just how much a man can endure. If the limit of what is bearable is reached, I have only to open the door to escape.","Writing is good, thinking is better. Being smart is good, being patient is better.","I should not have had that fear of death when I wished for it all the same. The unhappiness that I need and long for is different. It is of the kind that will let me suffer with eagerness and lust after death. That is the unhappiness, or happiness, that I am waiting for.","What is meditation? What is leaving one\'s body? What is fasting? What is holding one\'s breath? It is fleeing from the self, it is a short escape of the agony of being a self, it is a short numbing of the senses against the pain and the pointlessness of life. The same escape, the same short numbing is what the driver of an ox-cart finds in the inn, drinking a few bowls of rice-wine or fermented coconut-milk. Then he won\'t feel his self any more, then he won\'t feel the pains of life any more, then he finds a short numbing of the senses. When he falls asleep over his bowl of rice-wine, he\'ll find the same what Siddhartha and Govinda find when they escape their bodies through long exercises, staying in the non-self.","And occasionally I became very sad over that happiness, because I was well aware it couldn\u2019t last. I wasn\u2019t meant to exist in the lap of plenty and ease; I needed torment and persecution. I felt that some day I would awaken from those beautiful images of love and once be alone, in the cold world of the others, where there was only solitude or struggle for me, not peace or participation.","I can see that your thoughts are deeper than you yourself are able to express. But since this is so, you know, don\'t you, that you\'ve never lived what you are thinking and that isn\'t good. Only the ideas that we actually live are of any value. You knew all along that your sanctioned world was only half the world and you tried to suppress the second half the same way the priests and teachers do. You won\'t succeed. No one succeeds in this once he has begun to think.\\" This went straight to my heart. \\"But there are forbidden and ugly things in the world!\\" I almost shouted. \\"You can\'t deny that. And they are forbidden, and we must renounce them. Of course I know that murder and all kinds of vices exist in the world but should I become a criminal just because they exist?\\" \\"We won\'t be able to find all the answers today,\\" Max soothed me. \\"Certainly you shouldn\'t go kill somebody or rape a girl, no! But you haven\'t reached the point where you can understand the actual meaning of \'permitted\' and \'forbidden.\' You\'ve only sensed part of the truth. You will feel the other part, too, you can depend on it. For instance, for about a year you have had to struggle with a drive that is stronger than any other and which is considered \'forbidden.\' The Greeks and many other peoples, on the other hand, elevated this drive, made it divine and celebrated it in great feasts. What is forbidden, in other words, is not something eternal; it can change. Anyone can sleep with a woman as soon as he\'s been to a pastor with her and has married her, yet other races do it differently, even nowadays. That is why each of us has to find out for himself what is permitted and what is forbidden -forbidden for him. It\'s possible for one never to transgress a single law and still be a bastard. And vice versa. Actually it\'s only a question of convenience. Those who are too lazy and comfortable to think for themselves and be their own judges obey the laws. Others sense their own laws within them; things are forbidden to them that every honorable man will do any day in the year and other things are allowed to them that are generally despised. Each person must stand on his own feet.","to listen with a still heart, with a waiting, open soul, without passion, without desire, without judgement, without opinions.","Ephemeral, highly ephemeral is the world of formations; ephemeral, highly ephemeral are our clothes and hairstyles, and our hair and our bodies themselves.","\u0623\u0646\u0627 \u0623\u0639\u064a\u0634 \u0641\u064a \u0623\u062d\u0644\u0627\u0645\u064a. \u0625\u0646 \u0627\u0644\u0622\u062e\u0631\u064a\u0646 \u064a\u0639\u064a\u0634\u0648\u0646 \u0641\u064a \u0627\u0644\u0623\u062d\u0644\u0627\u0645 \u0648 \u0644\u0643\u0646 \u0644\u064a\u0633 \u0641\u064a \u0623\u062d\u0644\u0627\u0645\u0647\u0645. \u0648 \u0647\u0630 \u0647\u0648 \u0627\u0644\u0641\u0627\u0631\u0642","The horrors of the Middle Ages were really nonexistent. A man of the Middle Ages would detest the whole mode of our present-day life as something far more than horrible, far more than barbarous. Every age, every culture, every custom and tradition has its own character, its own weakness and its own strength, its beauties and ugliness; accepts certain sufferings as matters of course, puts up patiently with certain evils. Human life is reduced to real suffering, to hell, only when two ages, two cultures and religions overlap. A man of the Classical Age who had to live in medieval times would suffocate miserably just as a savage does in the midst of our civilization. Now there are times when a whole generation is caught in this way between two ages, two modes of life, with the consequence that it loses all power to understand itself and has no standard, no security, no simple acquiescence. Naturally, every one does not feel this equally strongly. A nature such as Nietzsche\'s had to suffer our present ills more than a generation in advance. What he had to go through alone and misunderstood, thousands suffer today.","Ah, das wei\xdf ich heute: nichts auf der Welt ist dem Menschen mehr zuwider, als den Weg zu gehen, der ihn zu sich selber f\xfchrt!","There are many ways in which the god can make us lonely and lead us to ourselves.","That is just what life is when it is beautiful and happy - a game!

A madman can produce ideas that resemble Plato\u2019s, and a pious little schoolboy in a Herrnhut institute can creatively reconstruct profound mythological associations in his mind, ideas to be found in the Gnostics or Zoroaster. But he doesn\u2019t know he\u2019s doing it! He\u2019s a tree or a stone, at best an animal, just as long as he doesn\u2019t know that.

Whoever knows how to speak to them, who ever knows how to listen to them, can learn the truth. They do not preach learning and precepts, they preach, undeterred by particulars, the ancient law of life. A tree says: A kernel is hidden in me, a spark, a thought, I am life from eternal life. The attempt and the risk that the eternal mother took with me is unique, unique the form and veins of my skin, unique the smallest play of leaves in my branches and the smallest scar on my bark. I was made to form and reveal the eternal in my own smallest special detail. A tree says: My strength is trust. I know nothing about my father, I know nothing about the thousand children that every year spring out of me. I live out the secret of my seed to the very end, and care for nothing else. I trust that God is in me. I trust that my labor is holy.

They are wiser than we are, as long as we do not listen to them. But when we have learned how to listen to trees, then the brevity and the quickness and the childlike hastiness of our thoughts achieve an incomparable joy. Whoever has learned how to listen to trees no longer wants to be a tree. He wants to be nothing except what he is. That is home. That is happiness.","Like a wallflower he stayed in the background waiting for someone to fetch him, someone more courageous and stronger than himself to tear him away and force him into happiness.","No, a true seeker could not accept any teachings, not if he sincerely wished to find something. But he who had found, could give his approval to every path, to every goal; nothing separated him from all the other thousands who lived in eternity, who breathed the Divine.","Quite a number of people are able to feel the beauty of the world profoundly and vastly, and to carry high, noble images in their souls, but they are unable to exteriorize these images, to create them for the enjoyment of others, to communicate them.","seriousness, young man, is an accident of time","But the world itself, what exists around us and inside of us, is never one-sided.

And if time is not real, then the gap which seems to be between the world and the eternity, between suffering and blissfulness, between evil and good, is also a deception.","Oh, was not all suffering time, were not all forms of tormenting oneself and being afraid time, was not everything hard, everything hostile in the world gone and overcome as soon as one had overcome time, as soon as time would have been put out of existence by one\'s thoughts?","\u0639\u0627\u0644\u0645 \u0627\u0644\u0645\u0638\u0627\u0647\u0631 \u0639\u0627\u0644\u0645 \u0639\u0627\u0628\u0631 \u060c \u0648\u0625\u0646 \u0637\u0631\u0627\u0632 \u062b\u064a\u0627\u0628\u0646\u0627 \u0648\u0634\u0639\u0631\u0646\u0627 \u0639\u0627\u0628\u0631 \u0625\u0644\u0649 \u0627\u0642\u0635\u0649 \u062d\u062f . \u0628\u0644 \u0625\u0646 \u0634\u0639\u0631\u0646\u0627 \u0648\u0627\u062c\u0633\u0627\u0645\u0646\u0627 \u0627\u0646\u0641\u0633\u0647\u0627 \u0639\u0627\u0628\u0631\u0629 .","He no longer saw the face of his friend Siddhartha, instead he saw other faces, many, a long sequence, a flowing river of faces, of hundreds, of thousands, which all came and disappeared, and yet all seemed to be there simultaneously, which all constantly changed and renewed themselves, and which were still all Siddhartha.

And, Govinda saw it like this, this smile of the mask, this smile of oneness above the flowing forms, this smile of simultaneousness above the thousand births and deaths, this smile of Siddhartha was precisely the same, was precisely of the same kind as the quiet, delicate, impenetrable, perhaps benevolent, perhaps mocking, wise, thousand-fold smile of Gotama, the Buddha, as he had seen it himself with great respect a hundred times. Like this, Govinda knew, the perfected ones are smiling.","No soy un hombre que sabe.

I believe I love that kind of music because it is amoral. Everything else is so moral that I\'m looking for something that isn\'t. Morality has always seemed to me insufferable.","He sat thus, lost in meditation, thinking Om, his soul as the arrow directed at Brahman.","There was once a man, Harry, called the Steppenwolf. He went on two legs, wore clothes, and was a human being, but nevertheless he was in reality a wolf of the Steppes. He had learned a good deal of all that people of a good intelligence can, and was a fairly clever fellow. What he had not learned, however, was this: to find contentment in himself and his own life. The cause of this apparently was that at the bottom of his heart he knew all the time (or thought he knew) that he was in reality not a man, but a wolf of the Steppes. Clever men might argue the point whether he truly was a wolf, whether, that is, he had been changed, before birth perhaps, from a wolf into a human being, or had been given the soul of a wolf, though born as a human being; or whether, on the other hand, this belief that he was a wolf was no more than a fancy or a disease of his.","He saw: this water ran and ran, incessantly it ran, and was nevertheless always there, was always at all times the same and yet new in every moment!","All existence seemed to be based on duality, on contrast. Either one was a man or one was a woman, either a wanderer or sedentary burgher, either a thinking person or a feeling person-no one could breathe in at the same time as he breathed out, be a man as well as a woman, experience freedom as well as order, combine instinct and mind. One always had to pay for one with the loss of the other, and one thing was always just as important and desirable as the other.","Now what we call \\"bourgeois,\\" when regarded as an element always to be found in humanlife, is nothing else than the search for a balance. It is the striving after a mean between thecountless extremes and opposites that arise in human conduct. If we take any one of thesecoupled opposites, such as piety and profligacy, the analogy is immediately comprehensible. It isopen to a man to give himself up wholly to spiritual views, to seeking after God, to the ideal of saintliness. On the other hand, he can equally give himself up entirely to the life of instinct, tothe lusts of the flesh, and so direct all his efforts to the attainment of momentary pleasures. Theone path leads to the saint, to the martyrdom of the spirit and surrender to God. The other pathleads to the profligate, to the martyrdom of the flesh, the surrender to corruption. Now it isbetween the two, in the middle of the road, that the bourgeois seeks to walk. He will neversurrender himself either to lust or to asceticism. He will never be a martyr or agree to his owndestruction. On the contrary, his ideal is not to give up but to maintain his own identity. Hestrives neither for the saintly nor its opposite. The absolute is his abhorrence. He may be ready toserve God, but not by giving up the fleshpots. He is ready to be virtuous, but likes to be easy andcomfortable in this world as well. In short, his aim is to make a home for himself between twoextremes in a temperate zone without violent storms and tempests; and in this he succeedsthough it be at the cost of that intensity of life and feeling which an extreme life affords. A mancannot live intensely except at the cost of the self. Now the bourgeois treasures nothing morehighly than the self (rudimentary as his may be). And so at the cost of intensity he achieves hisown preservation and security. His harvest is a quiet mind which he prefers to being possessedby God, as he does comfort to pleasure, convenience to liberty, and a pleasant temperature to thatdeathly inner consuming fire. The bourgeois is consequently by nature a creature of weakimpulses, anxious, fearful of giving himself away and easy to rule. Therefore, he has substitutedmajority for power, law for force, and the polling booth for responsibility.","Straight lines evidently belonged only to geometry, not to nature and life.","A goal stood before Siddhartha, a single goal: to become empty, empty of thirst, empty of wishing, empty of dreams, empty of joy and sorrow. Dead to himself, not to be a self any more, to find tranquility with an emptied heard, to be open to miracles in unselfish thoughts, that was his goal. Once all of my self was overcome and had died, once every desire and every urge was silent in the heart, then the ultimate part of me had to awake, the innermost of my being, which is no longer my self, the great secret.","Mancher wird niemals Mensch, bleibt Frosch, bleibt Eidechse, bleibt Ameise.

But in this case the attempt to destroy the personality and to break the will did not succeed. He was much too strong and hardy, too proud and spirited. Instead of destroying his personality they succeeded only in teaching him to hate himself. It was against himself that, innocent and noble as he was, he directed during his entire life the whole wealth of his fancy, the whole of his thought; and in so far as he let loose upon himself every barbed criticism, every anger and hate he could command, he was, in spite of all, a real Christian and a real martyr. As for others and the world around him he never ceased in his heroic and earnest endeavour to love them, to be just to them, to do them no harm, for the love of his neighbour was as strongly forced upon him as the hatred of himself, and so his whole life was an example that love of one\u2019s neighbour is not possible without love of oneself, that self-hate is really the same thing as sheer egoism, and in the long run breeds the same cruel isolation and despair.","Siddhartha listened. He was now nothing but a listener, completely concentrated on listening, completely empty, he felt, that he had now finished learning to listen. Often before, he had heard all this, these many voices in the river, today it sounded new. Already, he could no longer tell the many voices apart, not the happy ones from the weeping ones, not the ones of children from those of men, they all belonged together, the lamentation of yearning and the laughter of the knowledgeable one, the scream of rage and the moaning of the dying ones, everything was one, everything was intertwined and connected, entangled a thousand times. And everything together, all voices, all goals, all yearning, all suffering, all pleasure, all that was good and evil, all of this together was the world. All of it together was the flow of events, was the music of life. And when Siddhartha was listening attentively to this river, this song of a thousand voices, when he neither listened to the suffering nor the laughter, when he did not tie his soul to any particular voice and submerged his self into it, but when he heard them all, perceived the whole, the oneness, then the great song of the thousand voices consisted of a single word, which was Om: the perfection.","Young people have many pleasures and many sorrows, because they have only themselves to think of.","\u0648\u0645\u0627 \u0644\u0628\u062b\u062a \u0623\u0646 \u0644\u0627\u062d\u0638\u062a \u0628\u0645\u0636\u064a \u0627\u0644\u0632\u0645\u0646 \u0623\u0646 \u0627\u0644\u063a\u0645\u0648\u0636 \u0641\u064a \u0627\u0644\u0646\u0641\u0633 \u0648\u062a\u062f\u0631\u064a\u0628 \u0627\u0644\u0631\u0648\u062d \u0648\u0631\u0639\u0627\u064a\u062a\u0647\u0627\u060c \u0647\u0648 \u0645\u0627 \u064a\u0639\u0632\u0644\u0646\u064a \u0639\u0646 \u0627\u0644\u0622\u062e\u0631\u064a\u0646 \u0648\u064a\u062c\u0639\u0644\u0646\u064a \u062b\u0642\u064a\u0644\u0627 \u0639\u0644\u064a\u0647\u0645 \u063a\u0631\u064a\u0628\u0627 \u0641\u064a\u0647\u0645\u060c \u0648\u064a\u0633\u0644\u0628\u0646\u064a \u0627\u0644\u0642\u062f\u0631\u0629 \u0639\u0644\u0649 \u0641\u0647\u0645\u0647\u0645 \u0641\u0647\u0645\u0627 \u062d\u0642\u064a\u0642\u064a\u0627","And so Gotama wandered into the town to obtain alms, and the two Samanas recognized him only by his complete peacefulness of demeanor, by the stillness of his form, in which there was no seeking, no will, no counterfeit, no effort - only light and peace.","no matter how close two human beings may be, there is always a gulf between them which only love can bridge, and that only from hour to hour.","He had also learned that the sick and unfortunate are far more receptive to traditional magic spells and exorcisms than to sensible advice; that people more readily accept affliction and outward penances than the task of changing themselves, or even examining themselves; that they believe more easily in magic than reason, in formulas than experience . . .

They betrayed each other and expected being betrayed themselves.","No person has ever been completely himself, but each one strives to become so, some gropingly, others more lucidly, according to his abilities. Each one carries with him to the end traces of his birth, the slime and eggshells of a primordial world. Many a one never becomes a human being, but remains a frog, lizard, or ant.","See what monkeys we are! Look, such is man!\\" and at once all renown, all intelligence, all the attainments of the spirit, all progress towards the sublime, the great and the enduring in man fell away and became a monkey\'s trick!","That is why each of us has to find out for himself what is permitted and what is forbidden--forbidden for him. It\'s possible for one never to transgress a single law and still be a bastard. And vise versa. Actually it\'s only a question of convenience. Those who are too lazy and comfortable to think for themselves and be their own judges obey the laws. Others sense their own laws within them; things are forbidden to them that every honorable man will do any day in the year and other things are allowed to them that are generally despised. Each person must stand on his own feet.","Narcissus looked at him gravely: \\"I take you seriously when you are Goldmund. But you\'re not always Goldmund. I wish nothing more than to see you become Goldmund through and through. You are not a scholar, you are not a monk - scholars and monks can have a coarser grain. You think you\'re not learned or logical or pious enough for me. On the contrary, you are not enough yourself.","They had been talking about astrology, a forbidden science that was not pursued in the cloister. Narcissus had said that astrology was an attempt to arrange and order the many different types of human beings according to their natures and destinies. At this point Goldmund had objected: \\"You\'re forever talking of differences - I\'ve finally recognised a pet theory of yours. When you speak of the great difference that is supposed to exist between you and me, for instance, it seems to me that this difference is nothing but your strange determination to establish differences.\\"Narcissus: \\"Yes. You\'ve hit the nail on the head. That\'s it: to you, differences are quite unimportant; to me, they are what matters most. I am a scholar by nature; science is my vocation. And science is, to quote your words, nothing but the \'determination to establish differences.\' Its essence couldn\'t be defined more accurately. For us, the men of science, nothing is as important as the establishment of differences; science is the art of differentiation. Discovering in every man that which distinguishes him from others is to know him.","When Siddhartha left the grove, where the Buddha, the perfected one, stayed behind, where Govinda stayed behind, then he felt that in this grove his past life also stayed behind and parted from him. He pondered about this sensation, which filled him completely, as he was slowly walking along. He pondered deeply, like diving into a deep water he let himself sink down to the ground of the sensation, down to the place where the causes lie, because to identify the causes, so it seemed to him, is the very essence of thinking, and by this alone sensations turn into realizations and are not lost, but become entities and start to emit like rays of light what is inside of them.","We can understand one another, but each of us can only interpret himself.","I am superior to you only in one point: I\'m awake, whereas you are only half awake, or completely asleep sometimes. I call a man awake who knows in his conscious reason his innermost unreasonable force, drives, and weaknesses and knows how to deal with them.","\u0627\u0644\u0641\u062a\u0631\u0629 \u0627\u0644\u0623\u062e\u064a\u0631\u0629 \u0645\u0646 \u0643\u0644 \u0645\u0631\u062d\u0644\u0629 \u0645\u0646 \u0645\u0631\u0627\u062d\u0644 \u0627\u0644\u062d\u064a\u0627\u0629 \u062a\u062d\u0645\u0644 \u0644\u0648\u0646\u0627 \u062e\u0641\u064a\u0641\u0627 \u0645\u0646 \u0627\u0644\u0630\u0628\u0648\u0644 \u0648 \u0627\u0644\u0631\u063a\u0628\u0629 \u0641\u064a \u0627\u0644\u0645\u0648\u062a \u0630\u0627\u062a\u0647\u0627 \u064a\u0642\u0648\u062f\u0647\u0627 \u0625\u0644\u064a \u0645\u0643\u0627\u0646 \u062c\u062f\u064a\u062f,\u0625\u0644\u064a \u0627\u0644\u064a\u0642\u0638\u0629,\u0625\u0644\u064a \u0628\u062f\u0627\u064a\u0629 \u062c\u062f\u064a\u062f\u0629","Abschied war es, Herbst war es, Schicksal war es, wonach die Sommerrose so reif und voll geduftet hatte.","He thought, that all men, trickled away, changing constantly, until they finally dissolved, while the artist-created images remained unchangeably the same. He thought that the fear of death was perhaps the root of all art, perhaps also of all things of the mind. We fear death, we shudder at life\u2019s instability, we grieve to see the flowers wilt again and again, and the leaves fall, and in our hearts we know that we, too, are transitory and will search for laws and formulate thoughts, it is in order to salvage something from the great dance of death, to make something that lasts longer than we do. Perhaps the woman after whom the master shaped his beautiful Madonna is already wilted or dead, and soon he, too, will be dead; others will live in his house and eat at his table- but his work will still be standing hundreds of years from now, and longer. It will go on shimmering in the quiet cloister church, unchangingly beautiful, forever smiling with the same sad, flowering mouth.","With a smile, the man at the oar moved from side to side: \\"It is beautiful, sir, it is as you say.

The sun tanned his light shoulders by the banks of the river when bathing, performing the sacred ablutions, the sacred offerings. In the mango grove, shade poured into his black eyes, when playing as a boy, when his mother sang, when the sacred offerings were made, when his father, the scholar, taught him, when the wise men talked.

He already knew how to speak the Om silently, the word of words, to speak it silently into himself while inhaling, to speak it silently out of himself while exhaling, with all the concentration of his soul, the forehead surrounded by the glow of the clear-thinking spirit.

That he had felt this despair, this deep disgust, and that he had not succumbed to it, that the bird, the joyful source and voice in him was still alive after all, this was why he felt joy, this was why he laughed, this was why his face was smiling brightly under his hair which had turned gray.","G\xe2ndirea noastr\u0103 este o permanent\u0103 abstractizare, o \xeentoarcere a privirii de la sim\u0163uri, o \xeencercare de construire a unei lumi pur spirituale.

All the new understanding and sense of redemption this fateful time had yielded had surged, in the course of this past day, to such a wave of thought and clarity that he had felt he would remain forever on the crest even while he was beginning to drop down. Now he was in the trough again, still fighting, still secretly hoping, but gravely injured. For one brief, glowing day he had succeeded in practicing the simple art known to every blade of grass. For one scant day he had loved himself, felt himself to be unified and whole, not split into hostile parts; he had loved himself and the world and God in himself, and everywhere he went he had met nothing but love, approval, and joy. If a robber had attacked him yesterday, or a policeman had arrested him, that too would have been approval, harmony, the smile of fate. And now, in the midst of happiness, he had reversed course and was cutting himself down again. He sat in judgment on himself while his deepest self knew that all judgment was wrong and foolish. The world, which for the span of one day had been crystal clear and wholly filled with divinity, once more presented a harsh and painful face; every object had its own meaning and every meaning contradicted every other.\\"\\"He already knew that the choking feeling of dread would pass only if he stopped condemning and admonishing himself, if he stopped poking around in the old wounds. He knew that all pain, all stupidity, all evil became its opposite if he could recognize God in it, if he pursued it to its deepest roots, which extended far beyond weal and woe and good and evil. He knew that. But there was nothing to do about it; the evil spirit was in him, God was a word again, lovely but remote. He hated and despised himself, and this hatred came over him, when the time was ripe, as involuntary and inexorably as love and trustfulness at other times. And this was how it always must be. Again and again and again he would experience the grace and blessing, and again and again the accursed contrary.","Mozart is waiting for me.

Every transition from major to minor in a sonata, every transformation of a myth or a religious cult, every classical or artistic formulation was, I realized in that flashing moment, if seen with a truly meditative mind, nothing but a direct route into the interior of the cosmic mystery, where in the alternation between inhaling and exhaling, between heaven and earth, between Yin and Yang, holiness is forever being created.","The father touched Siddhartha\'s shoulder. \'You will go into the forest,\' he said, \'and become a Samana.

But often, I\'ll think of this day, oh exalted one, and of this hour, when my eyes beheld a holy man.","La nostra meta non \xe8 di trasformarci l\'un l\'altro, ma di conoscerci l\'un l\'altro e d\'imparare a vedere e a rispettare nell\'altro ci\xf2 che egli \xe8: il nostro opposto e il nostro completamento.","that perhaps you seek too much, that as a result of your seeking you cannot find.","\u0627\u0644\u0644\u0647 \u0648\u062d\u062f\u0647 \u064a\u0639\u0644\u0645 \u0643\u064a\u0641 \u064a\u0635\u0627\u062f\u0641 \u0623\u0646 \u064a\u0642\u0648\u0644 \u0625\u0646\u0633\u0627\u0646 \u0645\u0627 \u0634\u064a\u0626\u0627\u064b \u0645\u0627 \u0645\u062b\u0644 \u0647\u0630\u0627.\u0644\u0645 \u0623\u0643\u0646 \u0642\u062f \u0642\u0635\u062f\u062a \u0623\u0646 \u064a\u0643\u0648\u0646 \u0627\u0644\u0623\u0645\u0631 \u0628\u0647\u0630\u0647 \u0627\u0644\u0643\u0631\u0627\u0647\u064a\u0647, \u0644\u0643\u0646\u0646\u064a \u0644\u0645 \u064a\u0643\u0646 \u0644\u062f\u064a \u0623\u062f\u0646\u064a \u062a\u0635\u0648\u0631 \u0639\u0646 \u0627\u0644\u062e\u0631\u0627\u0628 \u0627\u0644\u0630\u064a \u0633\u0623\u062d\u062f\u062b\u0647, \u062a\u0644\u0641\u0637\u062a \u0628\u0634\u0626 \u0644\u0645 \u0623\u0643\u0646 \u0623\u0639\u064a \u0645\u0636\u0645\u0648\u0646\u0647 \u0644\u062d\u0638\u0629 \u0627\u0644\u062a\u0644\u0641\u0638 \u0628\u0647. \u0644\u0642\u062f \u0627\u0633\u062a\u0633\u0644\u0645\u062a \u0644\u062f\u0627\u0641\u0639 \u0636\u0639\u064a\u0641 \u0648 \u0641\u064a\u0647 \u0634\u064a\u0626 \u0645\u0646 \u0627\u0644\u0630\u0643\u0627\u0621 \u0648 \u0644\u0643\u0646\u0647 \u062d\u0627\u0642\u062f. \u0648 \u0635\u0627\u0631 \u0647\u0630\u0627 \u0627\u0644\u062f\u0627\u0641\u0639 \u0642\u062f\u0631\u064a. \u0644\u0642\u062f \u0627\u0642\u062a\u0631\u0641\u062a \u0628\u062a\u0641\u0627\u0647\u0647 \u0648 \u0627\u0633\u062a\u0647\u062a\u0627\u0631 \u0641\u0639\u0644\u0627\u064b \u0648\u062d\u0634\u064a\u0627\u064b, \u0627\u0639\u062a\u0628\u0631\u0647 \u0647\u0648... \u062d\u064f\u0643\u0645\u0627\u064b","Suddenly he thought he saw a trait of soul-less habit in her dear coarse face, something mechanical and unmysterious in her friendly smile, something unworthy of him. His gesture froze in mid-air; the smile froze on his face. Was he still in love with her, did he really still desire her? No, he had been there too often. All too often he had seen this selfsame smile and smiled back without a prompting from his heart. What had still been all right yesterday was suddenly no longer possible today.","Only the ideas that we actually live are of any value. You knew all along that your sanctioned world was only half the world and you tried to suppress the second half the same way the priests and teachers do. You won\'t succeed. No one succeeds in this once he has begun to think.","To deal with history [life] means to abandon one\'s self to chaos but to retain a belief in the ordination and the meaning. It is a very serious task.","Once, he said to her: \\"You are like me, you are different from most people. You are Kamala, nothing else, and inside of you, there is a peace and refuge, to which you can go at every hour of the day and be at home at yourself, as I can also do. Few people have this, and yet all could have it.","It was at a concert of lovely old music. After two or three notes of the piano the door was opened of a sudden to the other world. I sped through heaven and saw God at work. I suffered holy pains. I dropped all my defences and was afraid of nothing in the world. I accepted all things and to all things I gave up my heart. It did not last very long, a quarter of an hour perhaps; but it returned to me in a dream at night, and since, through all the barren days, I caught a glimpse of it now and then. Sometimes for a minute or two I saw it clearly, threading my life like a divine and golden track. But nearly always it was blurred in dirt and dust. Then again it gleamed out in golden sparks as though never to be lost again and yet was soon quite lost once more.","The unhappiness that I need and long for is of the kind that will let me suffer with eagerness and die with lust... That is the unhappiness or happiness I am waiting for...","I wanted \u2026 people to listen to the pulse of nature, to partake of the wholeness of life and not forget, under the pressure of their petty destinies, that we are not gods and have not created ourselves but are the children of the earth, part of the cosmos.","How foolish to wear oneself out in vain longing for warmth! Solitude is independence. It has been my wish and with the years I had attained it. It was cold. Oh, cold enough! But it was also still, wonderfully still and vast like the cold stillness of space in which the stars revolve.","Narziss was dark and thin of face, and Goldmund open and radiant as a flower. Narziss was a thinker and anatomiser, Goldmund a dreamer and a child. Yet things common to both could bridge these differences. Both were knightly and delicate; both set apart by visible signs from their fellows, since both had received the particular admonishment of fate.","Wisdom is not communicable. The wisdom which a wise man tries to communicate always sound foolish.","Knulp said: \u201cEvery human being has his own soul, he can\u2019t mix it with any other. Two people can meet, they can talk with one another, they can be close together. But their souls are like flowers, each rooted to its place. One can\u2019t go to another, because it would have to break away from its roots, and that it can\u2019t do. Flowers send out their scent and their seeds, because they would like to go to each other; but a flower can\u2019t do anything to make a seed go to its right place; the wind does that, and the wind comes and goes where it pleases.","This here,\\" he said playing with it, \\"is a stone, and will, after a certain time, perhaps turn into soil, and will turn from soil into a plant or animal or human being. In the past, I would have said: This stone is just a stone, it is worthless, it belongs to the world of the Maja; but because it might be able to become also a human being and a spirit in the cycle of transformations, therefore I also grant it importance. Thus, I would perhaps have thought in the past. But today I think: this stone is a stone, it is also animal, it is also god, it is also Buddha, I do not venerate and love it because it could turn into this or that, but rather because it is already and always everything\u2014 and it is this very fact, that it is a stone, that it appears to me now and today as a stone, this is why I love it and see worth and purpose in each of its veins and cavities, in the yellow, in the gray, in the hardness, in the sound it makes when I knock at it, in the dryness or wetness of its surface. There are stones which feel like oil or soap, and others like leaves, others like sand, and every one is special and prays the Om in its own way, each one is Brahman, but simultaneously and just as much it is a stone, is oily or juicy, and this is this very fact which I like and regard as wonderful and worthy of worship.","\u0644\u0645 \u0623\u0643\u0646 \u0623\u062d\u0633\u0628 \u0646\u0641\u0633\u064a \u0623\u062f\u064a\u0628\u0627\u064b \u0634\u0627\u0639\u0631\u0627\u064b. \u0641\u0645\u0627 \u0643\u0646\u062a \u0623\u0643\u062a\u0628\u0647 \u0645\u0646 \u062d\u064a\u0646 \u0625\u0644\u0649 \u0622\u062e\u0631 \u0643\u0627\u0646 \u0645\u0646 \u0642\u0628\u064a\u0644 \u0627\u0644\u0635\u062d\u0627\u0641\u0629 \u0627\u0644\u0645\u0633\u0644\u064a\u0629\u060c \u0644\u0627 \u0645\u0646 \u0627\u0644\u0623\u062f\u0628. \u0644\u0643\u0646\u064a \u0643\u0646\u062a \u0641\u064a\u0645\u0627 \u0628\u064a\u0646\u064a \u0648\u0628\u064a\u0646 \u0646\u0641\u0633\u064a \u0623\u062d\u0628\u0633 \u0623\u0645\u0644\u0627\u064b \u0641\u064a \u0623\u0646 \u062a\u062a\u0627\u062d \u0644\u064a \u0641\u064a \u064a\u0648\u0645 \u0645\u0646 \u0627\u0644\u0623\u064a\u0627\u0645 \u0641\u0631\u0635\u0629 \u062e\u0644\u0642 \u0634\u064a\u0621 \u0645\u0646 \u0627\u0644\u0623\u062f\u0628\u060c \u0646\u0634\u064a\u062f \u0639\u0638\u064a\u0645 \u062c\u0631\u0626 \u0644\u0644\u062d\u0646\u064a\u0646 \u0648\u0627\u0644\u062d\u064a\u0627\u0629","\u0644\u0645 \u0623\u0643\u0646 \u0623\u0631\u064a\u062f \u0625\u0644\u0627\u0651 \u0623\u0646 \u0623\u0639\u064a\u0634 \u0648\u0641\u0642 \u0627\u0644\u062f\u0651\u0648\u0627\u0641\u0639 \u0627\u0644\u062d\u0642\u064a\u0642\u064a\u0651\u0629 \u0627\u0644\u0651\u062a\u064a \u062a\u0646\u0628\u0639 \u0645\u0646 \u062f\u0627\u062e\u0644\u064a\u060c \u0641\u0644\u0645\u0627 \u0643\u0627\u0646 \u0627\u0644\u0623\u0645\u0631 \u0628\u0639\u0630\u0647 \u0627\u0644\u0635\u0651\u0639\u0648\u0628\u0629\u061f","It was a strange business and it made a sad and curious impression on me; everything that had belonged to me in these earlier years of my life left me, was alien and lost to me.

I parted from them without pain and all that remained was to wonder that I could have endured them so long.","The artistically inclined delight in the Game because it provides opportunities for improvisation and fantasy. The strict scholars and scientists despise it \u2013 and so do some musicians also \u2013 because, they say, it lacks that degree of strictness which their specialties can achieve. Well and good, you will encounter these antinomies, and in time you will discover that they are subjective, not objective \u2013 that, for example, a fancy-free artist avoids pure mathematics or logic not because he understands them and could say something about them if he wished, but because he instinctively inclines toward other things. Such instinctive and violent inclinations and disinclinations are signs by which you can recognize the pettier souls. In great souls and superior minds, these passions are not found. Each of us is merely one human being, merely an experiment, a way station. But each of us should be on the way toward perfection, should be striving to reach the center, not the periphery. Remember this: one can be a strict logician or grammarian, and at the same time full of imagination and music. One can be a musician or Glass Bead Game player and at the same time wholly devoted to rule and order. The kind of person we want to develop, the kind of person we aim to become, would at any time be able to exchange his discipline or art for any other. He would infuse the Glass Bead Game with crystalline logic, and grammar with creative imagination. That is how we ought to be. We should be so constituted that we can at any time be placed in a different position without offering resistance or losing our heads.","You were willing. Look, Kamala, when you throw a rock into the water, it will speed on the fastest course to the bottom of the water. This is how it is when Siddhartha has a goal, a resolution. Siddhartha does nothing, he waits, he thinks, he fasts, but he passes through the things of the world like a rock through water, without doing anything, without stirring; he is drawn, he lets himself fall. His goal attracts him, because he doesn\u2019t let anything enter his soul which might oppose the goal. This is what Siddhartha has learned among the Samanas. This is what fools call magic and of which they think it would be effected by means of the demons. Nothing is caused by demons, there are no demons. Everyone can perform magic, everyone can reach his goals, if he is able to think, if he is able to wait, if he is able to fast.","\u0643\u0644\u0645\u0627 \u0632\u0627\u062f \u0645\u0627 \u0646\u062a\u0637\u0644\u0628\u0647 \u0645\u0646 \u0623\u0646\u0641\u0633\u0646\u0627 \u0623\u0648 \u0643\u0644\u0645\u0627 \u0632\u0627\u062f \u0645\u0627 \u064a\u062a\u0637\u0644\u0628\u0647 \u0648\u0627\u062c\u0628\u0646\u0627 \u0645\u0646\u0627 \u0632\u0627\u062f\u062a \u0636\u0631\u0648\u0631\u0629 \u0627\u0644\u062a\u062c\u0627\u0626\u0646\u0627 \u0625\u0644\u064a \u0627\u0644\u062a\u0623\u0645\u0644 \u0645\u0635\u062f\u0631 \u0642\u0648\u0629 \u0648 \u0625\u0644\u064a \u0627\u0644\u062a\u0648\u0627\u0641\u0642 \u0628\u064a\u0646 \u0627\u0644\u0641\u0643\u0631 \u0648 \u0627\u0644\u0631\u0648\u062d,\u0643\u0644\u0645\u0627 \u0632\u0627\u062f \u062a\u0645\u0644\u0643 \u0645\u0647\u0645\u0629 \u0645\u0646 \u0627\u0644\u0645\u0647\u0645\u0627\u062a \u0644\u0646\u0627, \u0641\u0623\u062b\u0627\u0631\u062a\u0646\u0627 \u0648 \u0633\u0645\u062a \u0628\u0646\u0627 \u062a\u0627\u0631\u0629, \u0648 \u062a\u0627\u0631\u0629 \u0623\u062a\u0639\u0628\u062a\u0646\u0627 \u0648\u0623\u0631\u0647\u0642\u062a\u0646\u0627 , \u0623\u0635\u0628\u062d \u0625\u0647\u0645\u0627\u0644\u0646\u0627 \u0644\u0645\u0635\u062f\u0631 \u0627\u0644\u0642\u0648\u0629 \u0647\u0630\u0627 \u0623\u064a\u0633\u0631 \u0639\u0644\u064a\u0646\u0627 \u0648 \u0623\u0633\u0647\u0644 \u062d\u062f\u0648\u062b\u0627 \u0644\u0646\u0627, \u0628\u0627\u0644\u0638\u0628\u0637 \u0643\u0645\u0627 \u064a\u062d\u062f\u062b \u0644\u0646\u0627 \u0639\u0646\u062f\u0645\u0627 \u0646\u0646\u0647\u0645\u0643 \u0641\u064a \u0639\u0645\u0644 \u0641\u0643\u0631\u064a \u0627\u0646\u0647\u0645\u0627\u0643\u0627 \u0634\u062f\u064a\u062f\u0627 \u0648 \u064a\u0633\u0647\u0644 \u0639\u0644\u064a\u0646\u0627 \u0625\u0647\u0645\u0627\u0644 \u0627\u0644\u062c\u0633\u0645 \u0648 \u0627\u0644\u062a\u063a\u0627\u0636\u064a \u0639\u0646 \u0627\u0644\u0639\u0646\u0627\u064a\u0629 \u0628\u0647. \u0648 \u0639\u0638\u0645\u0627\u0621 \u0627\u0644\u0631\u062c\u0627\u0644 \u0643\u0627\u0646\u0648\u0627 \u0625\u0645\u0627 \u0639\u0644\u064a \u0645\u0639\u0631\u0641\u0629 \u0628\u0627\u0644\u062a\u0623\u0645\u0644 \u0648 \u0645\u0645\u0627\u0631\u0633\u062a\u0647, \u0623\u0648 \u0643\u0627\u0646\u0648\u0627 \u0641\u064a \u0627\u0644\u0637\u0631\u064a\u0642 \u0627\u0644\u0645\u0648\u0635\u0644 \u0625\u0644\u064a \u0627\u0644\u062a\u0623\u0645\u0644 \u062f\u0648\u0646 \u0639\u0644\u0645 \u0645\u0646\u0647\u0645, \u0641\u0645\u0646 \u0644\u0645 \u062a\u062a\u062d \u0644\u0647 \u0648\u0627\u062d\u062f\u0629 \u0645\u0646 \u0647\u0630\u0647, \u062d\u062a\u064a \u0648 \u0644\u0648 \u0643\u0627\u0646 \u0639\u0638\u064a\u0645 \u0627\u0644\u0645\u0648\u0647\u0628\u0629 \u0634\u062f\u064a\u062f \u0627\u0644\u0628\u0623\u0633, \u0641\u0642\u062f \u0627\u0646\u062a\u0647\u064a \u0628\u0647 \u0627\u0644\u0623\u0645\u0631 \u0625\u0644\u064a \u0627\u0644\u0641\u0634\u0644 \u0648 \u0627\u0644\u0627\u0646\u062d\u062f\u0627\u0631, \u0644\u0623\u0646 \u0645\u0647\u0645\u062a\u0647 \u0627\u0644\u062a\u064a \u0633\u0639\u064a \u0625\u0644\u064a \u062a\u0623\u062f\u064a\u062a\u0647\u0627 \u0642\u062f \u062a\u0645\u0644\u0643\u062a\u0647 \u062d\u062a\u064a \u0623\u0641\u0642\u062f\u062a\u0647 \u0627\u0644\u0642\u062f\u0631\u0629 \u0639\u0644\u064a \u0627\u0644\u062a\u062d\u0644\u0644 \u0645\u0646 \u062d\u064a\u0646 \u0644\u062d\u064a\u0646 \u0645\u0646 \u0627\u0644\u0623\u062d\u062f\u0627\u062b \u0627\u0644\u0645\u062d\u064a\u0637\u0629 \u0648 \u0627\u0644\u0627\u0628\u062a\u0639\u0627\u062f \u0639\u0646\u0647\u0627.\u0647\u0630\u0647 \u0647\u064a \u0627\u0644\u062d\u0642\u064a\u0642\u0629 \u0627\u0644\u0645\u0631\u0629, \u0648 \u0644\u0627 \u064a\u0639\u0644\u0645 \u0645\u0631\u0627\u0631\u062a\u0647\u0627 \u0625\u0644\u0627 \u0645\u0646 \u0636\u0644 \u0627\u0644\u0637\u0631\u064a\u0642 \u0645\u0631\u0629","I was a gamble of Nature, a throw of the dice into an uncertain realm, leading perhaps to something new, perhaps to nothing; and to let this throw from the primordial depths take effect, to feel its will inside myself and adopt it completely as my own will: that alone was my vocation.

Wind and wetness, autumn, bitter smell of foliage, scattered leaves of the elm tree.","Examine a person closely enough and you know more about him that he does himself.","When someone is seeking,\\" said Siddhartha, \\"it happens quite easily that he only sees the thing that he is seeking; that he is unable to find anything, unable to absorb anything, because he is only thinking of the thing he is seeking., because he has a goal, because he is obsessed with his goal. Seeking means: to have a goal; but finding means: to be free, to be receptive, to have no goal.

At night he saw the starts in the heavens and the sickle-shaped moon floating like a boat in the blue. He saw trees, stars, animals, clouds, rainbows, rocks, weeds, flowers, brook and river, the sparkle of dew on bushes in the morning, distant high mountains blue and pale; birds sang, bees hummed, the wind blew gently across the rice fields. All this, colored and in a thousand different forms, had always been there.","You don\'t force him, beat him, and give him orders because you know that \'soft\' is stronger than \'hard,\' that water is stronger than the rocks, that love is stronger than compulsion.","Trebao bi se ponositi bolom - svaki bol nas podseca na nas visoki polozaj\'.

It always ended, however, in resignation, in surrender to destiny.","Who read by night above the Rhine the cloudscript of the drifting mists? It was the Steppenwolf.

You, O worthy one, are perhaps indeed a seeker, for in striving towards your goal, you do not see many things that are under your nose.","Workshops, churches, and palaces were full of these fatal works of art; he had even helped with a few himself.

Among these, indeed, there are many who in a sense are suicides only by accident and in whose being suicide has no necessary place. Among the common run of men there are many of little personality and stamped with no deep impress of fate, who find their end in suicide without belonging on that account to the type of the suicide by inclination; while, on the other hand, of those who are to be counted as suicides by the very nature of their beings are many, perhaps a majority, who never in fact lay hands upon themselves. [\u2026] But just as there are those who at the least indisposition develop a fever, so do those whom we call suicides, and who are always very emotional and sensitive, develop at the least shock the notion of suicide. [\u2026] All suicides are familiar with the struggle against the temptation of suicide. Every one of them knows very well in some corner of his soul that suicide, though a way out, is rather a mean and shabby one, and that it is nobler and finer to be felled by life than by one\u2019s own hand.","I dropped all my defenses and was afraid of nothing in the world.

Walking the rosy paths of the fig tree garden, sitting in the bluish shade of the grove of contemplation, washing his limbs daily in the bath of repentance, sacrificing in the dim shade of the mango forest, his gestures of perfect decency, everyone\'s love and joy, he still lacked all joy in his heart. Dreams and restless thoughts came into his mind, flowing from the water of the river, sparkling from the stars of the night, melting from the beams of the sun, dreams came to him and a restlessness of the soul, fuming from the sacrifices, breathing forth from the verses of the Rig-Veda, being infused into him, drop by drop, from the teachings of the old Brahmans.","\u200eWe all share the same origin, our mothers; all of us come in at the same door. - from the preface to \'Demian","Every man is more than just himself; he also represents the unique, the very special and always significant and remarkable point at which the world\'s phenomena intersect, only once in this way and never again.","... to learn how to love the world, in order to stop comparing it to some world I wished, I imagined, some kind of perfection I had made up, but to leave it as it is and to love it and to enjoy being a part of it.\u2014These, oh Govinda, are some of the thoughts which have come into my mind.","I understand you well.

You should not take old people who are already dead seriously. It does them injustice. We immortals do not like things to be taken seriously. We like joking. Seriousness, young man, is an accident of time. It consists, I don\'t mind telling you in confidence, in putting too high a value on time. I, too, once put too high a value on time.

Then he stopped and emitted an ingenious whistle -- our signal from grade school days, and the boy was my friend who had shot himself when he was a student. Immediately I too became, like him, a boy of twelve, and the burning city and the distant thunder and the blustering storm of howling voices from all corners of the world sounded wondrously exquisite to our newly awakened ears. Now everything was good, and the dark nightmare in which I had lived for so many despairing years was gone forever.","I don\'t know whether I love Gina. I doubt it very much.

There is nothing to opinions, they may be beautiful or ugly, smart or foolish, everyone can support them or discard them. But the teachings, you\'ve heard from me, are no opinion, and their goal is not to explain the world to those who seek knowledge. They have a different goal; their goal is salvation from suffering.

Now it seemed to be the young man who showed honour and obedience to the old man, to authority and dignity; now again it was apparently the old man who was required to follow, serve, worship the figure of youth, of beginning, of mirth. And as he watched this at once senseless and significant dream circle, the dreamer felt alternately identical with the old man and the boy, now revering and now revered, now leading, now obeying; and in the course of these pendulum shifts there came a moment in which he was both, was simultaneously Master and small pupil; or rather he stood above both, was the instigator, conceiver, operator, and onlooker of the cycle, this futile spinning race between age and youth.","In his heart he heard the voice talking, which was newly awaking, and it told him: Love this water! Stay near it! Learn from it! Oh yes, he wanted to learn from it, he wanted to listen to it. He who would understand this water and its secrets, so it seemed to him, would also understand many other things, many secrets, all secrets.","During the dark hours I felt my sick heart expand and beat more furiously, and I no longer made any distinction between pleasure and pain, but one was similar to the other; both hurt and both were precious. Whether my inner life went well or badly, my discovered strength stood peacefully outside looking on and knew that light and dark were closely related and that sorrow and peace were rhythm, part and spirit of the same great music.","Nat\xfcrlich gibt es sehr viele Menschen, denen das Leben leichter f\xe4llt und die scheinbar oder wirklich \u201cgl\xfccklicher sind; es sind die nicht stark Individualisierten, die keine Probleme kennen.

He had learned to curb his own wishes. Once he remarked to one of his tutors: \\"It is a pity that you students aren\'t fully aware of the luxury and abundance in which you live. But I was exactly the same when I was still a student. We study and work, don\'t waste much time, and think we may rightly call ourselves industrious\u2013but we are scarcely conscious of all we could do, all that we might make of our freedom. Then we suddenly receive a call from the hierarchy, we are needed, are given a teaching assignment, a mission, a post, and from then on move up to a higher one, and unexpectedly find ourselves caught in a network of duties that tightens the more we try to move inside it. All the tasks are in themselves small, but each one has to be carried out at its proper hour, and the day has far more tasks than hours. That is well; one would not want it to be different. But if we ever think, between classrooms, Archives, secretariat, consulting room, meetings, and official journeys\u2013if we ever think of the freedom we possessed and have lost, the freedom for self-chosen tasks, for unlimited, far-flung studies, we may well feel the greatest yearning for those days, and imagine that if we ever had such freedom again we would fully enjoy its pleasures and potentialities.","A wolf of the Steppes that had lost its way and strayed into the towns and the life of the herd, a more striking image could not be found for his shy loneliness, his savagery, his restlessness, his homesickness, his homelessness.","Look, my dear Govinda, this is one of my thoughts, which I have found: wisdom cannot be passed on.

A melody occurs to you; you sing it silently, inwardly only; you steep your being in it; it takes possession of all your strength and emotions, and during the time it lives in you, it effaces all that is fortuitous, evil, coarse, and sad in you; it brings the world into harmony with you, it makes burdens light and gives wings to depressed spirits. The melody of a folk song can do that. And first of all harmony! For each harmonious chord of pure-toned notes - those of church bells, for example - fills the spirit with grace and delight, a feeling that is intensified by every additional note; and at times this can enchant the heart and make it tremble with bliss as no other sensual pleasure can.","How deaf and stupid I have been, he thought, walking on quickly.

He wanted the bright boy as a friend. He sensed in him his opposite, his complement; he would have liked to adopt, lead, enlighten, strengthen, and bring him to bloom. But he held himself back, for many reasons, almost all of them conscious. Most of all, he felt tied and hemmed in by his distaste for teachers or monks who, all too frequently, fell in love with a pupil or a novice. Often enough, he had felt with repulsion the desiring eyes of older men upon him, had met their enticements and cajoleries with wordless rebuttal. He understood them better now that he knew the temptation to love the charming boy, to make him laugh, to run a caressing hand through his blond hair.

As a ball-player plays with his balls, he played with his business-deals, with the people around him, watched them, found amusement in them; with his heart, with the source of his being, he was not with them.

It is a world that savours of warm corners, rabbits, servant girls, household remedies and dried fruit.

Perhaps that you\'re searching far too much? That in all that searching, you don\'t find the time for finding?\\" \\"How come?\\" asked Govinda. \\"When someone is searching,\\" said Siddhartha, \\"then it might easily happen that the only thing his eyes still see is that what he searches for, that he is unable to find anything, to let anything enter his mind, because he always thinks of nothing but the object of his search, because he has a goal, because he is obsessed by the goal.

Anyone with a touch of genius seems to his teachers a freak from the very first. As far as teachers are concerned, they define young geniuses as those who are bad, disrespectful, smoke at fourteen, fall in love at fifteen, can be found at sixteen hanging out in bars, read forbidden books, write scandalous essays, occasionally stare down a teacher in class, are marked in the attendance book as rebels, and are budding candidates for room-arrest. A school master will prefer to have a couple of dumbheads in class than a \u2026 genius. \u2026 His task is not to produce extravagant intellectuals but good Latinists, arimeticians and sober decent folk. \u2026 We have the consolation that among true geniuses the wounds always heal. \u2026 they create their art in spite of school. Once dead and enveloped by the comfortable nimbus of remoteness, they are paraded by the schoolmasters before other generations of students as showpieces and noble examples. \u2026 Time and again the ones who are detested by their teachers \u2026 are afterwards the ones who add to society\'s treasure.","The water changed to vapour and rose, became rain and came down again, became spring, brook and river, changed a new, flowed anew.","He pondered deeply, like diving into a deep water he let himself sink down to the ground of the sensation, down to the place where the causes lie, because to identify the causes, so it seemed to him, is the very essence of thinking, and by this alone sensations turn into realizations and are not lost, but become entities and start to emit like rays of light what is inside of them.","As for others and the world around him he never ceased in his heroic and earnest endeavour to love them, to be just to them, to do them no harm, for the love of his neighbor was as deeply in him as the hatred of himself, and so his whole life was an example that love of one\'s neighbor is not possible without love of oneself, and that self-hate is really the same thing as sheer egoism, and in the long run breeds the same cruel isolation and despair.","This landscape of clouds and sky.

The depths and the mysteries of the universe lie not where the clouds and blackness are; the depths are to be found in the spaces of clarity and serenity.

But the worst of it is that it is just this contentment that I cannot endure. After a short time it fills me with irrepressible hatred and nausea. In desperation I have to escape and throw myself on the road to pleasure, or, if that cannot be, on the road to pain. When I have neither pleasure nor pain and have been breathing for a while the lukewarm insipid air of these so-called good and tolerable days, I feel so bad in my childish soul that I smash my mouldering lyre of thanksgiving in the face of the slumbering god of contentment and would rather feel the very devil burn in me than this warmth of a well-heated room. A wild longing for strong emotions and sensations seethes in me, a rage against this toneless, flat, normal and sterile life. I have a mad impulse to smash something, a warehouse, perhaps, or a cathedral, or myself, to commit outrages, to pull off the wigs of a few revered idols, to provide a few rebellious schoolboys with the longed-for ticket to Hamburg, or to stand one or two representatives of the established order on their heads. For what I always hated and detested and cursed above all things was this contentment, this healthiness and comfort, this carefully preserved optimism of the middle classes, this fat and prosperous brood of mediocrity.","In dieser Traumwelt lebte er mehr als in der wirklichen Welt: Schulsaal, Klosterhof,\u2026 war nur Oberfl\xe4che, nur eine d\xfcnne Haut \xfcber der traumgef\xfcllten, \xfcnerwirklichen Bilderwelt.

Isn\'t it just as if I had turned about slowly and was on a long detour from being a man to being a child, from a thinker to a childlike person? And yet, this path has been very good, and the bird in my chest has not died. But what a path this has been! I had to pass through so much stupidity, so many vices, so many errors, so much disgust, so many disappointments and woes just to begin again. But it was fitting this way; my heart says \\"Yes\\" to it and my eyes smile at it. I\'ve had to experience despair. I\'ve had to descend to the most foolish of all thoughts--the thought of suicide--in order to be able to experience divine grace, to hear \\"Om\\" again, to be able to sleep and awaken properly again [...] Where else might my path lead me? This path is foolish; it moves in loops, and perhaps it is going around in a circle. Let it go where it likes; I want to follow it.","What would many happy citizens and trustworthy officials have become but unruly, stormy innovators and dreamers of useless dreams, if not for the effort of their schools?","For every true statement there is an opposite one that is also true; that language and the confines of time lead people to adhere to one fixed belief that does not account for the fullness of the truth. Because nature works in a self-sustaining cycle, every entity carries in it the potential for its opposite and so the world must always be considered complete.","Two thirds of my countrymen read this kind of newspaper, read things written in this tone every morning and every night, are every day worked up and admonished and incited, and robbed of their peace of mind and better feelings by them, and the end and aim of it all is to have the war over again, the next war that draws nearer and nearer, and it will be a good deal more horrible than the last. All that is perfectly clear and simple. Anyone could comprehend it and reach the same conclusion after a moment\'s reflection. But nobody wants to. Nobody wants to avoid the next war, nobody wants to spare himself and his children the next holocaust if this be the cost. To reflect for one moment, to examine himself for a while and ask what share he has in the world\'s confusions and wickedness - clearly, nobody wants to do that. And so there\'s no stopping it, and the next war is being pushed on with enthusiasm by thousands upon thousands day by day.","The source ran somewhere, far away from him, ran and ran invisibly, had nothing to do with his life any more.

You, oh venerable one, are perhaps indeed a searcher, because,striving for your goal, there are many things you don\'t see, which aredirectly in front of your eyes.","\u0623\u062d\u0633 \u0623\u0646\u0647 \u0644\u064a\u0633 \u063a\u0631\u064a\u0628\u0627 \u0645\u0636\u0637\u0647\u062f\u0627 \u0647\u0627\u0631\u0628\u0627,\u0648 \u0623\u0646\u0647 \u0645\u0646\u0628\u0633\u0637 \u0627\u0644\u0635\u062f\u0631,\u0644\u0627 \u064a\u0641\u0643\u0631 \u0641\u064a \u0634\u0626 ,\u0648 \u0644\u0627 \u064a\u0634\u062a\u0627\u0642 \u0625\u0644\u064a \u0634\u0626,\u0648 \u0623\u0646\u0647 \u0645\u0646\u062f\u0645\u062c \u0641\u064a \u0627\u0644\u062d\u0627\u0636\u0631 \u0627\u0644\u0647\u0627\u062f\u0626 \u0627\u0644\u0635\u0627\u0641\u064a \u0627\u0644\u0642\u0631\u064a\u0628 ,\u0648 \u0623\u0646\u0647 \u0634\u0627\u0643\u0631,\u0645\u0646\u062f\u0647\u0634 \u0642\u0644\u064a\u0644\u0627 \u0645\u0646 \u0646\u0641\u0633\u0647 \u0648 \u0645\u0646 \u0647\u0630\u0647 \u0627\u0644\u062d\u0627\u0644\u0629 \u0627\u0644\u062a\u064a \u064a\u0639\u0627\u0646\u064a\u0647\u0627 \u0646\u0627\u0639\u0645\u0627 \u0645\u063a\u062a\u0628\u0637\u0627\u0648 \u0645\u0646\u062f\u0647\u0634\u0627 \u0645\u0646 \u0647\u0630\u0627 \u0627\u0644\u0627\u0646\u0634\u0631\u0627\u062d \u0627\u0644\u0645\u062c\u0631\u062f \u0645\u0646 \u0627\u0644\u0631\u063a\u0628\u0627\u062a,\u0648 \u0645\u0646 \u0647\u0630\u0627 \u0627\u0644\u0635\u0641\u0627\u0621 \u0627\u0644\u0645\u062c\u0631\u062f \u0645\u0646 \u0627\u0644\u062a\u0648\u062a\u0631,\u0648 \u0645\u0646 \u0647\u0630\u0647 \u0627\u0644\u0637\u0631\u064a\u0642\u0629 \u0627\u0644\u064a\u0642\u0638\u0629 \u0627\u0644\u0645\u062c\u062f\u064a\u0629 \u0645\u0646 \u0627\u0644\u062a\u0645\u062a\u0639 \u0648 \u0627\u0644\u062a\u0623\u0645\u0644","The human attitude of which classical music is the expression is always the same; it is always based on the same kind of insight into life and strives for the same kind of victory over blind chance. Classical music as gesture signifies knowledge of the tragedy of the human condition, affirmation of human destiny, courage, cheerful serenity. The grace of a minuet by Handel or Couperin, the sensuality sublimated into delicate gesture to be found in many Italian composers or in Mozart, the tranquil, composed readiness for death in Bach \u2013 always there may be heard in these works a defiance, a death-defying intrepidity, a gallantry, and a note of superhuman laughter, of immortal gay serenity. Let that same note also sound in our Glass Bead Games, and in our whole lives, acts, and sufferings.","But it is part of our intellectual arrogance that we confront world history, especially in modern times, in much the same spirit that the hermits and ascetics of early Christianity confronted the theatrum mundi, the great theater of the world. History seems to us an arena of instincts and fashions, of appetite, avarice, and craving for power, of blood lust, violence, destruction, and wars, of ambitious ministers, venal generals, bombarded cities, and we too easily forget that this is only one of its many aspects. Above all we forget that we ourselves are a part of history, that we are the product of growth and are condemned to perish if we lose the capacity for further growth and change. We are ourselves history and share the responsibility for world history and our position in it. But we gravely lack awareness of this responsibility.","Just as I dress and go out to visit the professor and exchange a few more or less insincerecompliments with him, without really wanting to at all, so it is with the majority of men day byday and hour by hour in their daily lives and affairs. Without really wanting to at all, they paycalls and carry on conversations, sit out their hours at desks and on office chairs; and it is allcompulsory, mechanical and against the grain, and it could all be done or left undone just as well by machines; and indeed it is this never-ceasing machinery that prevents their being, like me, the critics of their own lives and recognizing the stupidity and shallowness, the hopeless tragedy and waste of the lives they lead, and the awful ambiguity grinning over it all. And they are right, right a thousand times to live as they do, playing their games and pursuing their business, instead of resisting the dreary machine and staring into the void as I do, who have left the track. Let no one think that I blame other men, though now and then in these pages I scorn and even deride them, or that I accuse them of the responsibility of my personal misery. But now that I have come so far, and standing as I do on the extreme verge of life where the ground falls away before me into bottomless darkness, I should do wrong and I should lie if I pretended to myself or to others that that machine still revolved for me and that I was still obedient to the eternal child\'s play of that charming world.","How exhausting all this was.

My reformation seemed to point in the direction ofDemian, but even this was a distant fate. I did not know myself, for I was too deeply involved. It had begunwith Beatrice, but for some time I had been living in such an unreal world with my paintings and my thoughtsof Demian that I\'d forgotten all about her, too. I could not have uttered a single word about my dreams andexpectations, my inner change, to anyone, not even if I had wanted to. But how could I have wanted to?","You poets are accustomed to finding words for everything beautiful and you don\u2019t even grant that people have hearts if they are less talkative about their feelings than you.","Govinda was standing in front of him, dressed in the yellow robe of an ascetic. Sad was how Govinda looked like, sadly he asked: Why have you forsaken me? At this, he embraced Govinda, wrapped his arms around him, and as he was pulling him close to his chest and kissed him, it was not Govinda any more, but a woman, and a full breast popped out of the woman\'s dress, at which Siddhartha lay and drank, sweetly and strongly tasted the milk from this breast.","O alegre e claro espelho de minha alma era muitas vezes emba\xe7ado por uma esp\xe9cie de melancolia mas, por ora, n\xe3o havia sido seriamente danificado.

Aos poucos fui me habituando a ela, como a uma amiga e confidente, n\xe3o a recebendo como um tormento, mas como um cansa\xe7o inquieto, que n\xe3o deixava de ter seu encanto.

Ali sre\u0107a je uvek bila tamo gde je neko umeo da voli i \u017eivi za svoja ose\u0107anja; ako ih je negovao, ako ih nije gazio i nije ih potiskivao, ona su mu donosila zadovoljstvo.Lepota ne pru\u017ea radost onome ko je poseduje, ve\u0107 onome ko ume da je voli i da joj se divi.","His small fragile ship had barely escaped a disaster; now it enters a region of new storms and uncharted depths through which even the best led ... cannot find a guide. He must find his own way and be his own saviour.","Most intellectuals and most artists belong to the same type. Only the strongest of them force their way through the atmosphere of the bourgeois earth and attain to the cosmic. The others all resign themselves or make compromises. Despising the bourgeoisie, and yet belonging to it, they add to its strength and glory; for in the last resort they have to share their beliefs in order to live. The lives of these infinitely numerous persons make no claim to the tragic; but they live under an evil star in a quite considerable affliction; and in this hell their talents ripen and bear fruit. The few who break free seek their reward in the unconditioned and go down in splendor. They wear the thorn crown and their number is small. The others, however, who remain in the fold and from whose talents the bourgeoisie reaps much gain, have a third kingdom left open to them, an imaginary and yet a sovereign world, humor. The lone wolves who know no peace, these victims of unceasing pain to whom the urge for tragedy has been denied and who can never break through the starry space,who feel themselves summoned thither and yet cannot survive in its atmosphere\u2014for them is reserved, provided suffering has made their spirits tough and elastic enough, a way of reconcilement and an escape into humor. Humor has always something bourgeois in it, although the true bourgeois is incapable of understanding it. In its imaginary realm the intricate and manyfaceted ideal of all Steppenwolves finds its realisation. Here it is possible not only to extol the saint and the profligate in one breath and to make the poles meet, but to include the bourgeois, too, in the same affirmation. Now it is possible to be possessed by God and to affirm the sinner, and vice versa, but it is not possible for either saint or sinner (or for any other of the unconditioned) to affirm as well that lukewarm mean, the bourgeois. Humor alone, that magnificent discovery of those who are cut short in their calling to highest endeavor, those who falling short of tragedy are yet as rich in gifts as in affliction, humor alone (perhaps the most inborn and brilliant achievement of the spirit) attains to the impossible and brings every aspect of human existence within the rays of its prism. To live in the world as though it were not the world, to respect the law and yet to stand above it, to have possessions as though \\"one possessed nothing,\\" to renounce as though it were no renunciation, all these favorite and often formulated propositions of an exalted worldly wisdom, it is in the power of humor alone to make efficacious.","Every phenomenon on earth is a parable and every parable is an open gate (...)","To stiffen into stone, to persevere!We long forever for the right to stay.But all that stays with us is fear,And we shall never rest upon our way.","\u0628\u064a\u062f \u0623\u0646 \u0645\u0627 \u0623\u0633\u0639\u0649 \u0625\u0644\u064a\u0647 \u0644\u064a\u0633 \u062a\u063a\u064a\u064a\u0631\u064e \u0630\u0627\u062a\u064a \u060c \u0641\u0648\u062d\u062f\u0647\u0627 \u0627\u0644\u0645\u0639\u062c\u0632\u0629 \u062a\u0645\u0644\u0643 \u0630\u0644\u0643 .. \u0648\u0643\u0644 \u0645\u0646 \u064a\u0646\u0634\u062f \u0645\u0639\u062c\u0632\u0629 \u060c \u0643\u0644 \u0645\u0646 \u064a\u062a\u0639\u0644\u0651\u0642 \u0628\u0647\u0627 \u0648\u064a\u062d\u0627\u0648\u0644 \u0628\u0644\u0648\u063a\u0647\u0627 \u0641\u0633\u064a\u0634\u0647\u062f \u062a\u0644\u0627\u0634\u064a\u0647\u0627 \u0623\u0645\u0627\u0645 \u0646\u0627\u0638\u0631\u064a\u0647 .. !\u0625\u0646 \u0645\u0627 \u0623\u0633\u0639\u0649 \u0625\u0644\u064a\u0647 \u0647\u0648 \u0623\u0646 \u0623\u0642\u0628\u064e\u0636\u064e \u0641\u064a \u0627\u0644\u062a\u0623\u0631\u062c\u062d \u0627\u0644\u062f\u0627\u0626\u0645 \u0628\u064a\u0646 \u0639\u0646\u0641 \u0627\u0644\u0645\u062a\u0636\u0627\u062f\u0627\u062a .. \u0648\u0623\u0646 \u0623\u0643\u0648\u0646 \u0639\u0644\u0649 \u0623\u0647\u0628\u0629 \u0627\u0644\u0627\u0633\u062a\u0639\u062f\u0627\u062f \u062d\u064a\u0646 \u062a\u0628\u0627\u063a\u062a\u0646\u064a \u0627\u0644\u0645\u0639\u062c\u0632\u0629 ..!\u0625\u0646 \u0645\u0637\u0645\u062d\u064a \u0647\u0648 \u0623\u0646 \u0623\u0628\u0642\u0649 \u0628\u063a\u064a\u0631 \u0645\u0627 \u0631\u0636\u0627 \u060c \u0648\u0623\u0646 \u0623\u0645\u0644\u0643 \u0627\u0644\u0642\u062f\u0631\u0629 \u0639\u0644\u0649 \u062a\u062d\u0645\u0644 \u0643\u0644 \u0647\u0630\u0627 \u0627\u0644\u0642\u0644\u0642 ..","Damit das M\xf6gliche entsteht, mu\xdf immer wieder das Unm\xf6gliche versucht werden.","Veo que piensas m\xe1s de lo que puedes expresar.

For it is the same indivisible divinity that is active through us and in Nature, and if the outside world were to be destroyed, a single one of us would be capable of rebuilding it: mountain and stream, tree and leaf, root and flower, yes, every natural form is latent within us, originates in the soul whose essence is eternity, whose essence we cannot know but which often intimates itself to us as the power to love and create.","\u0627\u0644\u0623\u0634\u064a\u0627\u0621 \u0627\u0644\u062a\u064a \u0646\u0631\u0627\u0647\u0627 \u0647\u064a \u0627\u0644\u0623\u0634\u064a\u0627\u0621 \u0630\u0627\u062a\u0647\u0627 \u0627\u0644\u062a\u064a \u0646\u062d\u0645\u0644\u0647\u0627 \u0641\u064a \u0623\u0639\u0645\u0627\u0642\u0646\u0627. \u0648\u0644\u0627 \u062d\u0642\u064a\u0642\u0629 \u0625\u0644\u0627 \u062a\u0644\u0643 \u0627\u0644\u062a\u064a \u0646\u062d\u0645\u0644\u0647\u0627 \u0641\u064a\u0646\u0627.","The law?\\" I asked curiously. \\"What law\'s that, Leo?\\"\\"The law of service.

For a long time, Siddhartha had been partaking in the discussions of the wise men, practising debate with Govinda, practising with Govinda the art of reflection, the service of meditation. He already knew how to speak the Om silently, the word of words, to speak it silently into himself while inhaling, to speak it silently out of himself while exhaling, with all the concentration of his soul, the forehead surrounded by the glow of the clear-thinking spirit.

In the clefts of rocks I observed the small, delicate, bright coloured flowers and the many wonderful mosses, and on clear days I used to like to walk uphill for an hour until I could see the clearly outlined distant peaks of high mountains, their blue silhouettes, and white, sparkling snow fields across the other side of the hill.","Even more remote from his way of thinking, even more impossible than any other thought, would have been words such as this: \u201cIs it only I alone who have created this experience, or is it objective reality?

At this point he recapitulated with astonishing exactness everything he had learned from me by his questioning. He went back to the first signs of fatigue, repugnance, and intellectual constipation, and showed me that this could have happened only to someone who had submerged himself disproportionately in his studies and that it was high time for me to recover my self-control, and to regain my energy with outside help. Since I had taken the liberty of discontinuing my regular meditation exercises, he pointed out, I should at least have realized what was wrong as soon as the first evil consequences appeared, and should have resumed meditation. He was perfectly right. I had omitted meditating for quite a while on the grounds that I had no time, was too distracted or out of spirits, or too busy and excited with my studies. Moreover, as time went on I had completely lost all awareness of my continuous sin of omission. Even now, when I was desperate and had almost run aground, it had taken an outsider to remind me of it. As a matter of fact, I was to have the greatest difficulty snapping out of this state of neglect. I had to return to the training routines and beginners\u2019 exercises in meditation in order gradually to relearn the art of composing myself and sinking into contemplation. With a small sigh the Magister ceased pacing the room. \u201cThat is what happened to me, and to this day I am still a little ashamed to talk about it. But the fact is, Joseph, that the more we demand of ourselves, or the more our task at any given time demands of us, the more dependant we are on meditation as a wellspring of energy, as the ever-renewing concord of mind and soul. And \u2013 I could if I wished give you quite a few more examples of this \u2013 the more intensively a task requires our energies, arousing and exalting us at one time, tiring and depressing us at another, the more easily we may come to neglect this wellspring, just as when we are carried away by some intellectual work we easily forget to attend to the body. The really great men in the history of the world have all either known how to meditate or have unconsciously found their way to the place to which meditation leads us. Even the most vigorous and gifted among the others all failed and were defeated in the end because their task or their ambitious dream seized hold of them, made them into persons so possessed that they lost the capacity for liberating themselves from present things, and attaining perspective. Well, you know all this; it\u2019s taught during the first exercises, of course. But it is inexorably true. How inexorably true it is, one realizes only after having gone astray.\u201d","Lascia che te lo dica oggi quanto ti voglio bene, quanto tu sei stato sempre per me, come hai arricchito la mia vita.

To obey like this, not to an external command, only to the voice, to be ready like this, this was good, this was necessary, nothing else was necessary.","Oh, if only it were possible to find understanding, Joseph exclaimed. \u201cIf only there were a dogma to believe in. Everything is contradictory, everything tangential; there are no certainties anywhere. Everything can be interpreted one way and then again interpreted in the opposite sense. The whole of world history can be explained as development and progress and can also be seen as nothing but decadence and meaninglessness. Isn\u2019t there any truth? Is there no real and valid doctrine?\u201d The Master had never heard him speak so fervently. He walked on in silence for a little, then said: \u201cThere is truth, my boy. But the doctrine you desire, absolute, perfect dogma that alone provides wisdom, does not exist. Nor should you long for a perfect doctrine, my friend. Rather, you should long for the perfection of yourself. The deity is within you, not in ideas and books. Truth is lived, not taught.

It was the self, I wanted to free myself from, which I sought to overcome. But I was not able to overcome it, could only deceive it, could only flee from it, only hide from it. Truly, no thing in this world has kept my thoughts thus busy, as this my very own self, this mystery of me being alive, of me being one and being separated and isolated from all others, of me being Siddhartha! And there is no thing in this world I know less about than about me, about Siddhartha!","my path had led me at that time into a new life, which had now grown old and is dead","to identify the causes, so it seemed to him, is the very essence of thinking, and by this alone sensations turn into realizations and are not lost, but become entities and start to emit like rays of light what is inside of them.","Knowledge can be expressed, but not wisdom.

I shall always take pleasure in study, how could it be otherwise? But I do not believe that my life will be limited to study. A man\'s wishes may not always determine his destiny, his mission; perhaps there are other predetermining factors.","If I were to reduce all my feelings and their painful conflicts to a single name, I can think of no other word but: dread. It was dread, dread and uncertainty, that I felt in all those hours of shattered childhood felicity: dread of punishment, dread of my own conscience, dread of stirrings in my soul which I considered forbidden and criminal.","Yes, so it was, everything came back, which had not been suffered and solved up to its end, the same pain was suffered over and over again.","Quoth Siddhartha: \\"What should I possibly have to tell you, oh venerable one? Perhaps that you\'re searching far too much? That in all that searching, you don\'t find the time for finding?","Have you also learned that secret from the river; that there is no such thing as time? That the river is everywhere at the same time, at the source and at the mouth, at the waterfall, at the ferry, at the current, in the ocean and in the mountains, everywhere and that the present only exists for it, not the shadow of the past nor the shadow of the future.","Devo acrescentar aqui uma observa\xe7\xe3o psicol\xf3gica: embora saiba muito pouco sobrea vida do Lobo da Estepe, tenho bons motivos para acreditar que foi educado por pais e professores bondosos, por\xe9m severos e muito devotos, desses que fundamentam toda a educa\xe7\xe3o no \' \'quebrantamento da vontade\'\'. Tal destrui\xe7\xe3o da personalidade e quebra do desejo n\xe3o foram conseguidas com aquele aluno, de cuja prova saiu mais insens\xedvel e duro, orgulhoso e espiritual. Em vez de destruir sua personalidade, conseguiu aprender somente a odiar a si mesmo. Contra si pr\xf3prio, contra esse objeto nobre e inocente, dirigiu a vida inteira toda a genialidade de sua fantasia, toda a for\xe7ade seu poderoso pensamento. Foi precisamente atrav\xe9s do Cristo e dos m\xe1rtires que aprendeu a lan\xe7ar contra si pr\xf3prio, antes de mais nada, cada severidade, cada censura, cada maldade, cada \xf3dio de que era capaz. No que respeitava aos outros, ao mundo em redor, sempre estava fazendo os esfor\xe7os mais her\xf3icos e s\xe9rios para am\xe1los,para ser justo com eles, para n\xe3o faz\xea-los sofrer, pois o \\"Amar\xe1s teu pr\xf3ximo!\\" estava t\xe3o entranhado em sua alma como o odiar-se a si mesmo\\"; assim, toda a sua vida era um exemplo do imposs\xedvel que \xe9 amar o pr\xf3ximo sem amor a si mesmo, de que o desprezo a si mesmo \xe9 em tudo semelhante ao acirrado ego\xedsmo e produz afinal o mesmo desespero e horr\xedvel isolamento.","Zugleich dachte ich: so wie ich jetzt mich anziehe und ausgehe, den Professor besuche und mehr oder weniger erlogene Artigkeiten mit ihm austausche, alles ohne es eigentlich zu wollen, so tun und leben und handeln die meisten Menschen Tag f\xfcr Tag, Stunde um Stunde zwanghaft und ohne es eigentlich zu wollen, machen Besuche, f\xfchren Unterhaltungen, sitzen Amts- und Bureaustunden ab, alles zwanghaft, mechanisch, ungewollt, alles k\xf6nnte ebensogut von Maschinen gemacht werden oder unterbleiben; und diese ewig fortlaufende Mechanik ist es, die sie hindert, gleich mir, Kritik am eigenen Leben zu \xfcbenm seine Dummheit und Seichtheit, seine hoffnungslose Trauer und \xd6de zu erkennen und zu f\xfchlen.","An enlightened man had but one duty--to seek the way to himself, to reach inner certainty, to grope his wayforward, no matter where it led. The realization shook me profoundly, it was the fruit of this experience. I had often speculated with images of the future, dreamed of roles that I might be assigned, perhaps as poet orprophet or painter, or something similar. \\tAll that was futile. I did not exist to write poems, to preach or topaint, neither I nor anyone else. All of that was incidental. Each man had only one genuine vocation--to findthe way to himself. He might end up as poet or madman, as prophet or criminal--that was not his affair,ultimately it was of no concern. His task was to discover his own destiny--not an arbitrary one--and live it outwholly and resolutely within himself.

Already he could no longer distinguish the many voices, could not distinguish the gay from the weeping, the childish from the virile; they all belonged together, the yearning laments and the wise man\u2019s laughter, the cry of anger and the moans of the dying; they were all one, all of them interlinked and interwoven, bound together in a thousand ways. And all of this together\u2014all the voices, all the goals, all the longing, all the suffering, all the pleasure, everything good and everything bad\u2014all of it together was the world. All of it together was the river of occurrences, the music of life. And when Siddhartha listened attentively to this river, to this thousand-voiced song, when he listened neither for the sorrow nor for the laughter, when he did not attach his soul to any one voice and enter into it with his ego but rather heard all of them, heard the whole, the oneness\u2014then the great song of the thousand voices consisted only of a single word: Om, perfection.","If a transaction in progress appeared threatened with failure, if a shipment of goods seemed to have gone astray, or if a debtor appeared unable to repay his debt, Kamaswami was never able to persuade Siddhartha that it was useful to speak words of worry or of anger, to have a wrinkled brow, or to sleep poorly.","But living alone forever and ever, among the quietly sleeping tree trunks, with animals that ran away, with whom one could not speak\u2014that would be unbearably sad.","And all this, I said, just as today was the case with the beginnings of wireless, would be of no more service to man than as an escape from himself and his true aims, and a means of surrounding himself with an ever closer mesh of distractions and useless activities.","\u0644\u0633\u062a \u0627\u0646\u062a \u0627\u0644\u0645\u0624\u0647\u0644 \u0644\u0644\u062a\u0641\u0643\u064a\u0631\u0641\u064a\u0645\u0627 \u0625\u0630\u0627 \u0643\u0627\u0646 \u0627\u0644\u0644\u0647 \u064a\u0646\u0635\u062a \u0625\u0644\u0649 \u0635\u0644\u0648\u0627\u062a\u0643\u060c \u0623\u0648 \u0625\u0646 \u0643\u0627\u0646 \u0645\u0648\u062c\u0648\u062f\u0627 \u062d\u0642\u0627 \u0643\u0645\u0627 \u062a\u062a\u062e\u064a\u0644\u0647 \u0623\u0646\u062a. \u0648\u0644\u064a\u0633 \u0645\u0646 \u0634\u0623\u0646\u0643 \u0623\u0646 \u062a\u063a\u062a\u0627\u0638 \u0623\u0648 \u062a\u0646\u062a\u0627\u0628\u0643 \u0627\u0644\u062d\u064a\u0631\u0629 \u062d\u0648\u0644 \u0645\u0627 \u0625\u0630\u0627 \u0643\u0627\u0646\u062a \u0643\u0644 \u0635\u0631\u0627\u0639\u0627\u062a\u0646\u0627 \u0627\u0644\u0625\u0646\u0633\u0627\u0646\u064a\u0629 \u0645\u0627 \u0647\u064a \u0625\u0644\u0649 \u0644\u0639\u0628 \u0623\u0637\u0641\u0627\u0644. \u064a\u062c\u0628 \u0623\u0646 \u062a\u062d\u0631\u0645 \u0639\u0644\u0649 \u0646\u0641\u0633\u0643 \u062a\u062d\u0631\u064a\u0645\u0627 \u062a\u0627\u0645\u0627 \u062a\u0642\u0644\u064a\u0628 \u0643\u0644 \u062a\u0644\u0643 \u0627\u0644\u0625\u0641\u0643\u0627\u0631 \u0627\u0644\u0635\u0628\u064a\u0627\u0646\u064a\u0629 \u0627\u0644\u062d\u0645\u0642\u0627\u0621 \u0623\u062b\u0646\u0627\u0621 \u062a\u062f\u0631\u0628\u0643. \u0627\u062a\u0644 \u0627\u0644\u0635\u0644\u0627\u0629 \u0627\u0644\u0631\u0628\u0627\u0646\u064a\u0629 \u0648\u062a\u0631\u062a\u064a\u0644\u0643 \u0648\u0643\u0631\u0633 \u0646\u0641\u0633\u0643 \u0644\u0644\u0643\u0644\u0645\u0627\u062a \u0627\u0645\u062a\u0644\u0649\u0621 \u0628\u0647\u0627 \u062f\u0639\u0647\u0627 \u062a\u0646\u0641\u0630 \u0641\u064a\u0643 \u0648\u0643\u0623\u0646\u0643 \u062a\u063a\u0646\u064a \u0623\u0648 \u062a\u0639\u0632\u0641 \u0627\u0644\u0642\u064a\u062b\u0627\u0631\u0629 \u0641\u062d\u064a\u0646 \u062a\u063a\u0646\u064a \u0623\u0648 \u062a\u0639\u0632\u0641 \u0644\u0627 \u062a\u062f\u0639 \u0639\u0642\u0644\u0643 \u064a\u0634\u0631\u062f \u0644\u064a\u062a\u0635\u064a\u062f \u0623\u0641\u0643\u0627\u0631\u0627 \u0648\u062a\u0623\u0645\u0644\u0627\u062a \u062d\u0627\u0630\u0642\u0629. \u0625\u0646\u0645\u0627 \u0623\u0646\u062a \u062a\u0643\u0627\u0641\u062d \u0644\u0625\u062e\u0631\u0627\u062c \u0643\u0644 \u0646\u063a\u0645\u0629 \u062a\u0646\u0642\u0631\u0647\u0627 \u0628\u0623\u0642\u0635\u0649 \u0645\u0627 \u0628\u0637\u0627\u0642\u062a\u0643 \u0641\u064a \u0648\u0636\u0648\u062d \u0648\u0643\u0645\u0627\u0644. \u0648\u0639\u0646\u062c\u0645\u0627 \u0646\u063a\u0646\u064a \u0644\u0627 \u0646\u0639\u064a\u0642 \u0623\u0646\u0641\u0627\u0633\u0646\u0627 \u0628\u062a\u0633\u0627\u0624\u0644\u0646\u0627 \u0639\u0646 \u062c\u062f\u0648\u0649 \u0627\u0644\u063a\u0646\u0627\u0621\u060c \u0625\u0646\u0646\u0627 \u0646\u063a\u0646\u064a\u060c \u0644\u0627 \u0623\u0643\u062b\u0631! \u0648\u0647\u0643\u0630\u0627 \u064a\u062c\u0628 \u0623\u0646 \u0646\u0635\u0644\u064a","Nos sentimos tentados a creerlos caprichos nuestros, creaciones propias, vemos vacilar y disolverse la frontera entre nosotros y la naturaleza, y adquirimos conciencia de un estado de \xe1nimo en el que no sabemos si las im\xe1genes en nuestra retina provienen de impresiones exteriores o interiores.

No man has ever been entirely and completely himself. Yet each one strives to become that--one in an awkward, the other in a more intelligent way, each as best he can. Each man carries the vestiges of his birth--the slime and eggshells of his primeval past--with him to the end of his days. Some never become human, remaining frog, lizard, ant. Some are human above the waist, fish below. Each represents a gamble on the part of nature in creation of the human. We all share the same origin, our mothers; all of us come in at the same door. But each of us--experiments of the depths--strives toward his own destiny.

But in the middle of this obtained freedom Harry suddenly realized that he was alone, that the world left him alone in a very sinister way, that people did non interest him, that he himself did non interest himself that he continued to live more and more in an air without any relations where he slowly suffocated in loneliness.","Beautiful was the world, colourful was the world, strange and mysterious was the world! Here was blue, here was yellow, here was green, the sky and the river flowed, the forest and the mountains were rigid, all of it was beautiful, all of it was mysterious and magical, and in its midst was he, Siddhartha, the awakening one, on the path to himself. All of this, all this yellow and blue, river and forest, entered Siddhartha for the first time through the eyes, was no longer a spell of Mara, was no longer the veil of Maya, was no longer a pointless and coincidental diversity of mere appearances, despicable to the deeply thinking Brahman, who scorns diversity, who seeks unity. Blue was blue, river was river, and if also in the blue and the river, in Siddhartha, the singular and divine lived hidden, so it was still that very divinity\'s way and purpose, to be here yellow, here blue, there sky, there forest, and here Siddhartha. The purpose and the essential properties were not somewhere behind the things, they were in them, in everything.","Be aware of too much wisdom!","E poi di nuovo, come oggi, pu\xf2 divenirmi problematico il fatto che abbia veramente visto, udito, odorato qualcosa o se invece tutto ci\xf2 che credo di percepire altro non sia se non l\'immagine della mia vita interiore proiettata fuori di me.","Para poder todav\xeda osar el salto en el espacio, ten\xeda un lobo estepario as\xed que enfrentarse alguna vez consigo mismo, mirar hondamente en el caos de la propia alma y llegar a la plena conciencia de s\xed.","Smiling, Siddhartha felt happiness at the friendship and friendliness of the ferryman. He is like Govinda, he thought, smiling. All the people I meet upon my way are like Govinda. All of them are grateful, though they themselves have cause to expect gratitude.

But all of this was just and proper.","This world, as it now is, wants to die, it wants to perish, and it will.","These records, however much or however little of real life may lie at the back of them, are notan attempt to disguise or to palliate this widespread sickness of our times. They are an attempt topresent the sickness itself in its actual manifestation. They mean, literally, a journey through hell,a sometimes fearful, sometimes courageous journey through the chaos of a world whose soulsdwell in darkness, a journey undertaken with the determination to go through hell from one endto the other, to give battle to chaos, and to suffer torture to the full.","...he knew more than you and I, without teachers, without books, just because he believed in the river.","Slowly blossomed, slowly ripened in Siddhartha the realization, the knowledge, what wisdom actually was, what the goal of his long search was. It was nothing but a readiness of the soul, an ability, a secret art, to think every moment, while living his life, the thought of oneness, to be able to feel and inhale the oneness.","It is good, he thought, to taste for oneself all that it is necessary to know. Already as a child I learned that worldly desires and wealth were not good things. I have known this for a long time but have only now experienced it. And now I do know it, know it not only with my memory but with my eyes, with my heart, and with my stomach. How glad I am to know it!","Though he was near perfection and was bearing his final wound, it still seemed to him as if those childlike people were his brothers, their vanities, desires for possession, and ridiculous aspects were no longer ridiculous to him, became understandable, became lovable, even became worthy of veneration to him.","The most lively young people become the best old people, not those who pretend to be as wise as grandfathers while they are still in school.","Love between young people and love after many years of marriage is not the same thing.","Words are not good for the secret meaning; everything always becomes a little bit different the moment one speaks it aloud, a bit falsified, a bit foolish\u2014yes, and this too is also very good and pleases me greatly: that one person\u2019s treasure and wisdom always sounds like foolishness to others.","the headmaster [\u2026] pledged that, provided he behaved himself, he would be duly sheltered and cared for by the state for the rest of his days. It did not occur to any of the boys, nor their fathers, that all this would perhaps not really be free.","You were willing. See here, Kamala: When you throw a stone into water, it falls quickly by the fastest route to the bottom of the pond. This is the way it is when Siddhartha has an aim, an intention. Siddhartha does nothing\u2014he waits, he thinks, he fasts\u2014but he passes through the things of the world like the stone through the water, without bestirring himself. He is drawn forward and he lets himself fall. His goal draws him to it, for he lets nothing enter his mind that interferes with the goal. This is what Siddhartha learned from the shramanas. This is what fools call magic, thinking that it is brought about by demons. Nothing is brought about by demons; demons do not exist. Anyone can do magic, anyone can reach his goals if he can think, wait, and fast.","The world was beautiful, the world was particolored, strange and quizzical.... Meaning and essence were not somewhere behind things, they were inside things, in everything.","Perhaps you yourself have notions about the Glass Bead Game, expecting more of it than it will give you, or perhaps the reverse. There is no doubt that the Game has its dangers. For that very reason we love it; only the weak are sent out on paths without perils. But never forget what I have told you so often: our mission is to recognize contraries for what they are: first of all as contraries, but then as opposite poles of a unity. Such is the nature of the Glass Bead Game.","That I know nothing about myself, that Siddhartha has remained thus alien and unknown to me, stems from one cause, a single cause: I was afraid of myself, I was fleeing from myself! I searched Atman, I searched Brahmin, I was willing to dissect myself and peel off all of its layers, to find the core of all peels in its unknown interior, the Atman, life, the divine part, the ultimate part. But I have lost myself in the process.","Wer lieben kann, ist glusklick.","En d\xe9pit de toutes les profondes diff\xe9rences de leurs natures, tous deux avaient beaucoup appris l\'un de l\'autre; entre eux, \xe0 c\xf4t\xe9 de la langue de la raison, il s\'\xe9tait peu \xe0 peu form\xe9 un parler de l\'\xe2me, un langage de signes, de m\xeame que, entre deux agglom\xe9rations, il y a bien une route sur laquelle circulent les voitures et les cavaliers, mais \xe0 c\xf4t\xe9 se tracent beaucoup de petites sentes, de chemins de traverse, de sentiers d\xe9tourn\xe9s; chemins pour les enfants, sentiers pour les amoureux, sentes \xe0 peine visibles pour les chiens et les chats.

Govinda knew: he would not become a common Brahman, not a lazy official in charge of offerings; not a greedy merchant with magic spells; not a vain, vacuous speaker; not a mean, deceitful priest; and also not a decent, stupid sheep in the herd of the many.","Don\'t talk so horribly,\' she scolded. \'It is quite natural. I like you too. You, too, have something nice about you that endears you and marks you out. I wouldn\'t have you different. One oughtn\'t to talk of these things and want them accounted for. Listen, when you kiss my neck or my ear, I feel that I please you, that you like me. You have a way of kissing as though you were shy, and that tells me: \\"You please him. He is grateful to you for being pretty.\\" That gives me great, great pleasure. And then again with another man it\'s just to opposite that pleases me, that he kisses me as though he thought little of me and conferred a favor.","Et faire de la science, ce n\'est rien d\'autre que de s\'acharner \xe0 d\xe9couvrir des diff\xe9rences.

It may be presumed that he has never carefully watched a real wolf. Had he done so he would have seen, perhaps, that even animals are not undivided in spirit. With them, too, the well-knit beauty of the body hides a being of manifold states and strivings. The wolf, too, has his abysses. The wolf, too, suffers. No, back to nature is a false track that leads nowhere but to suffering and despair. Harry can never turn back again and become wholly wolf, and could he do so he would find that even the wolf is not of primeval simplicity, but already a creature of manifold complexity. Even the wolf has two, and more than two, souls in his wolf\'s breast, and he who desires to be a wolf falls into the same forgetfulness as the man who sings: \\"If I could be a child once more!\\" He who sentimentally sings of blessed childhood is thinking of the return to nature and innocence and the origin of things, and has quite forgotten that these blessed children are beset with conflict and complexities and capable of all suffering.","I have already given some account of the Steppenwolf\u2019s outward appearance.

A man cannot live intensely except at the cost of the self.","If we try to identify the interim stage of human development that has been attained in fulfillment of the spiritual demands that have been set by religious leaders of humanity since Zoroaster and Lao Tzu, then we must say that humans nowadays are still far closer to gorillas than they are to being men.","L\'intelligence aime ce qui est fixe, ce qui a forme; elle veut pouvoir se fier \xe0 ses signes, elle aime ce qui est, non ce qui est en devenir; le r\xe9el, non le possible.

And all this, I said, just as today was the case with the beginnings of wireless, would be of no more service to man than as an escape from himself and his true aims, and a means of surrounding himself with an ever closer mesh of distractions and useless activities.","I looked at my life, and it was also a river, and the boy Siddhartha was only separated from the man Siddhartha and from the old man Siddhartha by a shadow, not by something real. Also, Siddhartha\'s previous births were no past, and his death and his return to Brahma was no future. Nothing was, nothing will be; everything is, everything has existence and is present.","He was numbered among the suicides. And here it must be said that to call suicides only those who actually destroy themselves is false. Among these, indeed, there are many who in a sense are suicides only by accident and in whose being suicide has no necessary place. Among the common run of men there are many of little personality and stamped with no deep impress of fate, who find their end in suicide without belonging on that account to the type of the suicide by inclination; while on the other hand, of those who are to be counted as suicides by the very nature of their beings are many, perhaps a majority, who never in fact lay hands on themselves. The \\"suicide,\\" and Harry was one, need not necessarily live in a peculiarly close relationship to death. One may do this without being a suicide. What is peculiar to the suicide is that his ego, rightly or wrongly, is felt to be an extremely dangerous, dubious, and doomed germ of nature; that he is always in his own eyes exposed to an extraordinary risk, as though he stood with the slightest foothold on the peak of a crag whence a slight push from without or an instant\'s weakness from within suffices to precipitate him into the void. The line of fate in the case of these men is marked by the belief they have that suicide is their most probable manner of death. It might be presumed that such temperaments, which usually manifest themselves in early youth and persist through life, show a singular defect of vital force. On the contrary, among the \\"suicides\\" are to be found unusually tenacious and eager and also hardy natures.","My advice to the person suffering from lack of time and from apathy is this: Seek out each day as many as possible of the small joys, and thriftily save up the larger, more demanding pleasures for holidays and appropriate hours. It is the small joys first of all that are granted us for recreation, for daily relief and disburdenment, not the great ones.","Pero,aunque parezca paradojico,lo que en si mismo is imposible,debe de ser intentado siempre de nuevo.","Muy distinto es cuando nuestra veneraci\xf3n y nuestro cari\xf1o son ajenos a todo h\xe1bito y corresponden a una pura inclinaci\xf3n personal, cuando de todo coraz\xf3n hemos sido el amigo o el disc\xedpulo. En estos casos, es un instante amargo y terrible aquel en el que vislumbramos de repente que la corriente dominante en nosotros quiere apartarnos de la persona querida. Cada uno de los pensamientos que rechazan al amigo o al maestro se vuelve entonces, con aguij\xf3n envenenado, contra nuestro propio coraz\xf3n, y cada uno de los golpes que asestamos nos hiere, de retorno, en el rostro.","It was clear to me that my hosts too were feeling anything but comfortable, that their cheerfulness was forced, whether because they were inhibited by me, or else were out of sorts for some domestic reason. They only asked me questions it was impossible to give an honest answer to and, as a result, I had soon lied myself into such a corner that every word I uttered almost made me sick. Eventually in an effort to distract them, I started to tell them about the funeral I had witnessed that day, but I struck a wrong note. My attempts at humour did nothing to improve the general mood, and we were increasingly at odds with one another. Inside me, Steppenwolf was laughing and baring his teeth and, by the time dessert was served, we had all three fallen quite silent.","Fue la primera fractura en los pilares que sosten\xedan la majestuosidad con la que yo ve\xeda a mi padre; fue la primera vez que perd\xeda la confianza en mi padre, y que en verdad todo hombre debe perder alg\xfan d\xeda para lograr ser \xe9l mismo.

Thus, like a precious, fleeting foam over the sea of suffering arise all those works of art, in which a single individual lifts himself for an hour so high above his personal destiny that his happiness shines like a star and appears to all who see it as something eternal and as a happiness of their own.","The realization of what wisdom actually was slowly blossomed and ripened in Siddhartha\u2014and he discovered what the goal of his long search was.

Full of arrogance, he had been, always the smartest, always working the most, always one step ahead of all others, always the knowing and spiritual one, always the priest or wise one. Into being a priest, into this arrogance, into this spirituality, his self had retreated, there it sat firmly and grew, while he thought he would kill it by fasting and penance. Now he saw it and saw that the secret voice had been right, that no teacher would ever have been able to bring about his salvation. Therefore, he had to go out into the world, lose himself to lust and power, to woman and money, had to become a merchant, a dice-gambler, a drinker, and a greedy person, until the priest and Samana in him was dead. Therefore, he had to continue bearing these ugly years, bearing the disgust, the teachings, the pointlessness of a dreary and wasted life up to the end, up to bitter despair, until Siddhartha the lustful, Siddhartha the greedy could also die. He had died, a new Siddhartha had woken up from the sleep. He would also grow old, he would also eventually have to die, mortal was Siddhartha, mortal was every physical form.

In order that something like cohesion, something like causality, that some kind of meaning might ensue and that it can in some way be narrated, the historian must invent units, a hero, a nation, an idea, and he must allow to happen to this invented unit what has in reality happened to the nameless.","I will learn from myself, be my own pupil; I will learn from myself the secret of Siddhartha.","\u03a4\u03af\u03c0\u03bf\u03c4\u03b1 \u03c3\u03c4\u03bf\u03bd \u03ba\u03cc\u03c3\u03bc\u03bf \u03b4\u03b5\u03bd \u03b5\u03af\u03bd\u03b1\u03b9 \u03c0\u03b9\u03bf \u03b4\u03c5\u03c3\u03ac\u03c1\u03b5\u03c3\u03c4\u03bf \u03b1\u03c0\u03cc \u03c4\u03bf \u03bd\' \u03b1\u03ba\u03bf\u03bb\u03bf\u03c5\u03b8\u03ae\u03c3\u03b5\u03b9 \u03ba\u03b1\u03bd\u03b5\u03af\u03c2 \u03c4\u03bf \u03bc\u03bf\u03bd\u03bf\u03c0\u03ac\u03c4\u03b9 \u03c0\u03bf\u03c5 \u03bf\u03b4\u03b7\u03b3\u03b5\u03af \u03c3\u03c4\u03b7\u03bd \u03b1\u03c5\u03c4\u03bf\u03b3\u03bd\u03c9\u03c3\u03af\u03b1.","Just try it once \u2014 a tree, or at least a considerable section of sky, is to be seen anywhere.

You will find every day that the gable of every house has its own particular look, its own special lighting.

The sun tanned his light shoulders by the banks of the river when bathing, performing the sacred ablutions, the sacred offerings. In the mango grove, shade poured into his black eyes, when playing as a boy, when his mother sang, when the sacred offerings were made, when his father, the scholar, taught him, when the wise men talked. For a long time, Siddhartha had been partaking in the discussions of the wise men, practising debate with Govinda, practising with Govinda the art of reflection, the service of meditation. He already knew how to speak the Om silently, the word of words, to speak it silently into himself while inhaling,","Pronto me di cuenta de que estas ense\xf1anzas pod\xedan ser un consuelo s\xf3lo para los que las aceptaran literalmente y que creyeran ser la verdad.

I had no fear of people; my schoolmates had found that out, too, and showed me a secret respect that often made me smile. Whenever I wished, I could see through most of them very well and occasionally amaze them that way. But I seldom or never felt like it. I was always occupied with myself, always with myself. And I desired ardently to experience a bit of life finally, to give something of myself to the world, to create a relationship with it and do battle with it. Sometimes, when I roamed through the streets in the evening and, in my restlessness, was unable to return to my room until midnight, I would imagine that I just must meet my beloved now; she would pass by at the next corner, call to me from the nearest window. Sometimes, too, all this seemed unbearably painful to me, and I was mentally prepared to take my life at some point. At that time I found a peculiar refuge\u2014by \u201caccident, as people say.

When he ferried travelers of the ordinary kind, childlike people, businessmen, warriors, women, these people did not seem alien to him as they used to: he understood them, he understood and shared their life, which was not guided by thoughts and insight, but solely by urges and wishes, he felt like them. Though he was near perfection and was bearing his final wound, it still seemed to him as if those childlike people were his brothers, their vanities, desires for possession, and ridiculous aspects were no longer ridiculous to him, became understandable, became lovable, even became worthy of veneration to him. The blind love of a mother for her child, the stupid, blind pride of a conceited father for his only son, the blind, wild desire of a young, vain woman for jewelry and admiring glances from men, all of these urges, all of this childish stuff, all of these simple, foolish, but immensely strong, strongly living, strongly prevailing urges and desires were now no childish notions for Siddhartha any more, he saw people living for their sake, saw them achieving infinitely much for their sake, traveling, conducting wars, suffering infinitely much, bearing infinitely much, and he could love them for it, he saw life, that what is alive, the indestructible, the Brahman in each of their passions, each of their acts. Worthy of love and admiration were these people in their blind loyalty, their blind strength and tenacity. They lacked nothing, there was nothing the knowledgeable one, the thinker, had to put him above them except for one little thing, a single, tiny, small thing: the consciousness, the conscious thought of the oneness of all life.","Of course!

We like joking. Seriousness, young man, is an accident of time. It consists, I don\u2019t mind telling you in confidence, in putting too high a value on time.

Then there arise ideals such as thoseof the Americans or of the Bolsheviks. Both are extraordinarily rational, and both lead to afrightful oppression and impoverishment of life, because they simplify it so crudely.

It is the striving after a mean between thecountless extremes and opposites that arise in human conduct. If we take any one of thesecoupled opposites, such as piety and profligacy, the analogy is immediately comprehensible. It isopen to a man to give himself up wholly to spiritual views, to seeking after God, to the ideal of saintliness. On the other hand, he can equally give himself up entirely to the life of instinct, tothe lusts of the flesh, and so direct all his efforts to the attainment of momentary pleasures. Theone path leads to the saint, to the martyrdom of the spirit and surrender to God. The other pathleads to the profligate, to the martyrdom of the flesh, the surrender to corruption. Now it isbetween the two, in the middle of the road, that the bourgeois seeks to walk. He will neversurrender himself either to lust or to asceticism. He will never be a martyr or agree to his owndestruction. On the contrary, his ideal is not to give up but to maintain his own identity. Hestrives neither for the saintly nor its opposite. The absolute is his abhorrence. He may be ready to serve God, but not by giving up the fleshpots. He is ready to be virtuous, but likes to be easy and comfortable in this world as well. In short, his aim is to make a home for himself between two extremes in a temperate zone without violent storms and tempests; and in this he succeeds though it be at the cost of that intensity of life and feeling which an extreme life affords. A man cannot live intensely except at the cost of the self. Now the bourgeois treasures nothing more highly than the self (rudimentary as his may be). And so at the cost of intensity he achieves his own preservation and security. His harvest is a quiet mind which he prefers to being possessed by God, as he does comfort to pleasure, convenience to liberty, and a pleasant temperature to that deathly inner consuming fire. The bourgeois is consequently by nature a creature of weak impulses, anxious, fearful of giving himself away and easy to rule. Therefore, he has substituted majority for power, law for force, and the polling booth for responsibility.","La seriet\xe0, caro mio, \xe8 una nota del tempo: nasce, te lo voglio confidare, dal sopravvalutare il tempo.

But you mix the desire, fear and regret, and that is a contradiction.","Perhaps that you\'re searching far too much? That in all that searching, you don\'t find the time for finding?","This Steppenwolf of ours has always been aware of at least the Faustian two-fold nature within him. He has discovered that the one-fold of the body is not inhabited by a one-fold of the soul, and that at best he is only at the beginning of a long pilgrimage towards this ideal harmony. He would like either to overcome the wolf and become wholly man or to renounce mankind and at last to live wholly a wolf\'s life. It may be presumed that he has never carefully watched a real wolf. Had he done so he would have seen, perhaps, that even animals are not undivided in spirit. With them, too, the well-knit beauty of the body hides a being of manifold states and strivings. The wolf, too, has his abysses. The wolf, too, suffers. No, back to nature is a false track that leads nowhere but to suffering and despair. Harry can never turn back again and become wholly wolf, and could he do so he would find that even the wolf is not of primeval simplicity, but already a creature of manifold complexity. Even the wolf has two, and more than two, souls in his wolf\'s breast, and he who desires to be a wolf falls into the same forgetfulness as the man who sings: \\"If I could be a child once more!\\" He who sentimentally sings of blessed childhood is thinking of the return to nature and innocence and the origin of things, and has quite forgotten that these blessed children are beset with conflict and complexities and capable of all suffering. There is, in fact, no way back either to the wolf or to the child. From the very start there is no innocence and no singleness. Every created thing, even the simplest, is already guilty, already multiple. It has been thrown into the muddy stream of being and may never more swim back again to its source. The way to innocence, to the uncreated and to God leads on, not back, not back to the wolf or to the child, but ever further into sin, ever deeper into human life. Nor will suicide really solve your problem, unhappy Steppenwolf. You will, instead, embark on the longer and wearier and harder road of life. You will have to multiply many times your two-fold being and complicate your complexities still further. Instead of narrowing your world and simplifying your soul, you will have to absorb more and more of the world and at last take all of it up in your painfully expanded soul, if you are ever to find peace. This is the road that Buddha and every great man has gone, whether consciously or not, insofar as fortune favored his quest. All births mean separation from the All, the confinement within limitation, the separation from God, the pangs of being born ever anew. The return into the All, the dissolution of painful individuation, the reunion with God means the expansion of the soul until it is able once more to embrace the All.","Without a mother you cannot die.","Un veggente e un cieco: cos\xec camminavano a fianco; e se il cieco ignorava la sua cecit\xe0, il sollievo era solo suo.","Let me return from history and draw my conclusion. What all this means to us at the present time is this: Our system has already passed its flowering. Some time ago it reached that summit of blessedness which the mysterious game of world history sometimes allows to things beautiful and desirable in themselves. We are on the downward slope. Our course may possible stretch out for a very long time, but in any case nothing finer, ore beautiful, and more desirable than what we have already had can henceforth be expected. The road leads downhill. Historically we are, I believe, ripe for dismantling. And there is no doubt that such will be our fate, not today or tomorrow, but the day after tomorrow. I do not draw this conclusion from any excessively moralistic estimate of our accomplishments and our abilities: I draw it far more from the movements which I see already on the way in the outside world. Critical times are approaching; the omens can be sensed everywhere; the world is once again about to shift its center of gravity. Displacements of power are in the offing. They will not take place without war and violence. From the Far East comes a threat not only to peace, but to life and liberty. Even if our country remains politically neutral, even if our whole nation unanimously abides by tradition (which is not the case) and attempts to remain faithful to Castalian ideals, that will be in vain. Some of our representatives in Parliament are already saying that Castalia is a rather expensive luxury for our country. The country may very soon be forced into a serious rearmament - armaments for defensive purposes only, of course - and great economies will be necessary. In spite of the government\'s benevolent disposition towards us, much of the economizing will strike us directly. We are proud that our Order and the cultural continuity it provides have cost the country as little as they have. In comparison with other ages, especially the early period of the Feuilletonistic Age with its lavishly endowed universities, its innumerable consultants and opulent institutes, this toll is really not large. It is infinitesimal compared with the sums consumed for war and armaments during the Century of Wars. But before too long this kind of armament may once again be the supreme necessity; the generals will again dominate Parliament; and if the people are confronted with the choice of sacrificing Castalia or exposing themselves to the danger of war and destruction, we know how they will choose. Undoubtedly a bellicose ideology will burgeon. The rash of propaganda will affect youth in particular. Then scholars and scholarship, Latin and mathematics, education and culture, will be considered worth their salt only to the extent that they can serve the ends of war.","Bilmeyecek ne var!

Each age will take certain kinds of suffering for granted, will patiently accept certain wrongs. Human life becomes a real hell of suffering only when two ages, two cultures and religions overlap. Required to live in the Middle Ages, someone from the Graeco-Roman period would have died a wretched death by suffocation, just as a savage inevitably would in the midst our civilization. Now, there are times when a whole generation gets caught to such an extent between two eras, two styles of life, that nothing comes naturally to it since it has lost all sense of morality, security and innocence. A man of Nietzsche\u2019s mettle had to endure our present misery more than a generation in advance.

Nevertheless, Siddhartha remained in this village for several days; he arranged a feast for the peasants, distributed copper coins among their children, helped celebrate a marriage, and returned from his trip in the best of spirits.Kamaswami reproached him for not having returned home at once, saying he had wasted money and time.Siddhartha answered, \\"Do not scold me, dear friend! Never has anything been achieved by scolding. If there are losses, let me bear them. I am very pleased with this journey I made the acquaintance of many different people, a Brahmin befriended me, children rode on my knees, peasants showed me their fields, and no one took me for a tradesman.\\"\\"How very lovely!\\" Kamaswami cried out indignantly. \\"But in fact a tradesman is just what you are! Or did you undertake this journey solely for your own pleasure?\\"\\"Certainly.\\" Siddhartha laughed. \\"Certainly I undertook the journey for my pleasure. Why else? I got to know new people and regions, enjoyed kindness and trust, found friendship. You see, dear friend, had I been Kamaswami, I\'d have hurried home in bad spirits the moment I saw my purchase foiled, and indeed money and time would have been lost. But by staying on as I did, I had some agreeable days, learned things, and enjoyed pleasures, harming neither myself nor others with haste and bad spirits. And if ever I should return to this place, perhaps to buy some future harvest or for whatever other purpose, I shall be greeted happily and in friendship by friendly people and I shall praise myself for not having displayed haste and displeasure on my first visit. So be content, friend, and do not harm yourself by scolding! When the day arrives when you see that this Siddhartha is bringing you harm, just say the word and Siddhartha will be on his way. But until that day, let us be satisfied with each other.","There was nothing to be made of us intellectuals.

This hermit soon sensed a kindred soul in Goldmund, in spite of their apparent contrasts. Narcissus was dark and spare; Goldmund, a radiant youth.

But something they had in common bridged these contrasts: both were refined; both were different from the others because of obvious gifts and signs; both bore the special mark of fate.","If I could talk and teach, I might be a sage, but I am only a ferryman, and my task is to ferry people across this river.

Beautiful were the moon and the stars, beautiful was the stream and the banks, the forest and the rocks, the goat and the golden beetle, the flower and the butterfly. It was beautiful and lovely to walk through the world, childlike and awake, open to what is near without distrust.","Truly, no thing in this world has so occupied my thoughts as has my own self, the riddle of the fact I am alive, that I am distinct, and separate from all others, that I am Siddhartha!

They seem to have formed an uncommonly popular section of the daily newspapers, were produced by the millions, and were a major source of mental pabulum for the reader in want of culture. They reported on, or rather \\"chatted\\" about, a thousand-and-one items of knowledge. The cleverer writers poked fun at their own work. Many such pieces are so incomprehensible that they can only be viewed as self-persiflage on the part of the authors.In some periods interviews with well-known personalities on current problems were particularly popular. Noted chemists or piano virtuosos would be queried about politics, for example, or popular actors, dancers, gymnasts, aviators, or even poets would be drawn out on the benefits and drawbacks of being a bachelor, or on the presumptive causes of financial crises, and so on.All that mattered in these pieces was to link a well-known name with a subject of current topical interest.It is very hard indeed for us to put ourselves in the place of those people so that we can truly understand them. But the great majority, who seem to have been strikingly fond of reading, must have accepted all these grotesque things with credulous earnestness.If a famous painting changed owners, if a precious manuscript was sold at auction, if an old palace burned down, the readers of many thousands of feature articles at once learned the facts. What is more, on that same day or by the next day at the latest they received an additional dose of anecdotal, historical, psychological, erotic, and other stuff on the catchword of the moment.A torrent of zealous scribbling poured out over every ephemeral incident, and in quality, assortment, and phraseology all this material bore the mark of mass goods rapidly and irresponsibly turned out.Incidentally, there appear to have been certain games which were regular concomitants of the feature article. The readers themselves took the active role in these games, which put to use some of their glut of information fodder.Thousands upon thousands spent their leisure hours sitting over squares and crosses made of letters of the alphabet, filling in the gaps according to certain rules.But let us be wary of seeing only the absurd or insane aspect of this, and let us abstain from ridiculing it. For these people with their childish puzzle games and their cultural feature articles were by no means innocuous children or playful Phaeacians.Rather, they dwelt anxiously among political, economic, and moral ferments and earthquakes, waged a number of frightful wars and civil wars, and their little cultural games were not just charming, meaningless childishness.These games sprang from their deep need to close their eyes and flee from unsolved problems and anxious forebodings of doom into an imaginary world as innocuous as possible.They assiduously learned to drive automobiles, to play difficult card games and lose themselves in crossword puzzles--for they faced death, fear, pain, and hunger almost without defenses, could no longer accept the consolations of the churches, and could obtain no useful advice from Reason.These people who read so many articles and listened to so many lectures did not take the time and trouble to strengthen themselves against fear, to combat the dread of death within themselves; they moved spasmodically on through life and had no belief in a tomorrow.","Here it is Saturday.

And now I know this, not just in my mind, but in my eyes, my heart, and my stomach.","Even as a child I had had at intervals a fondness for observing strange forms in nature, not so much examining them as surrendering myself to their magic, their oblique message. Long tree-roots, coloured veins in rock, patches of oil floating on water, flaws in glass\u2014all such things had a certain fascination for me, above all, water and fire, smoke, clouds, dust and expecially the swirling specks of colour which swam before my closed eyes.","Non fa nessuna differenza, salvo un piccolo particolare, che per me ad ogni modo \xe8 di massima importanza.

It is a temporary palliative against the pain and folly of life. The driver of oxen makes this same flight, takes this temporary drug when he drinks a few bowls of rice wine or coconut milk in the inn. He then no longer feels his Self, no longer feels the pain of life; he then experiences temporary escape. Falling asleep over his bowl of rice wine, he finds what Siddhartha and Govinda find when they escape from their bodies by long exercises and dwell in the non-Self.","Every person\u2019s life is a journey toward himself, the attempt at a journey, the intimation of a path. No person has ever been completely himself, but each one strives to become so, some gropingly, others more lucidly, according to his abilities. Each one carries with him to the end traces of his birth, the slime and eggshells of a primordial world.","You\'re free this evening, Barbele. You just don\'t want to come.","I have learned that learning is impossible! I believe that in fact there is nothing in anything that we could call \'learning\'. There is only a kind of knowledge that is everywhere, my friend, and that is Atman.","Now what we call \\"bourgeois,\\" when regarded as an element always to be found in humanlife, is nothing else than the search for a balance. It is the striving after a mean between thecountless extremes and opposites that arise in human conduct. If we take any one of thesecoupled opposites, such as piety and profligacy, the analogy is immediately comprehensible. It isopen to a man to give himself up wholly to spiritual views, to seeking after God, to the ideal ofsaintliness. On the other hand, he can equally give himself up entirely to the life of instinct, tothe lusts of the flesh, and so direct all his efforts to the attainment of momentary pleasures. Theone path leads to the saint, to the martyrdom of the spirit and surrender to God. The other pathleads to the profligate, to the martyrdom of the flesh, the surrender to corruption. Now it isbetween the two, in the middle of the road, that the bourgeois seeks to walk. He will neversurrender himself either to lust or to asceticism. He will never be a martyr or agree to his owndestruction. On the contrary, his ideal is not to give up but to maintain his own identity. Hestrives neither for the saintly nor its opposite. The absolute is his abhorrence. He may be ready toserve God, but not by giving up the fleshpots. He is ready to be virtuous, but likes to be easy andcomfortable in this world as well. In short, his aim is to make a home for himself between twoextremes in a temperate zone without violent storms and tempests; and in this he succeedsthough it be at the cost of that intensity of life and feeling which an extreme life affords. A mancannot live intensely except at the cost of the self. Now the bourgeois treasures nothing morehighly than the self (rudimentary as his may be). And so at the cost of intensity he achieves hisown preservation and security. His harvest is a quiet mind which he prefers to being possessedby God, as he does comfort to pleasure, convenience to liberty, and a pleasant temperature to thatdeathly inner consuming fire. The bourgeois is consequently by nature a creature of weakimpulses, anxious, fearful of giving himself away and easy to rule. Therefore, he has substitutedmajority for power, law for force, and the polling booth for responsibility.","Patria non \xe8 qua o l\xe0.

For example, a truth can only be expressed and enveloped in words if it is one-sided. Everything that is thought and expressed in words is one-sided, only half the truth; it all lacks totality, completeness, unity. When the Illustrious Buddha taught about the world, he had to divide it into Sansara and Nirvana, into illusion and truth, into suffering and salvation. One cannot do otherwise, there is no other method for those who teach. But the world itself, being in and around us, is never one-sided. Never is a man or a deed wholly Sansara or wholly Nirvana; never is a man wholly a saint or a sinner.","Was it not a comedy, a strange and stupid thing, this repetition, this course of events in a fateful circle?","... The unlimited spaciousness of the horizon affected me as deeply. Once again, as in childhood, I beheld the soft blue of immeasurable distances beckoning to me like an open gate. And the feeling swept over me that I was not born for a normal life at home among my people or in cities and houses, but my fate was to wander through foreign regions and make odysseys on the sea. Darkly, the old melancholy longing rose up in me to throw myself on G**\'s mercy and merge my own pitifully insignificant life with the infinite and timeless...","[...] ci\xf2 che \xe8 tesoro e saggezza d\'un uomo suoni sempre un po\' sciocco alle orecchie degli altri.","Often they sat together in the evenings beside the riverbank on the tree trunk, sat in silence, both listening to the water, which for them was not water but rather the voice of Life, the voice of Being, of the eternally Becoming.","These games sprang from their deep need to close their eyes and flee from unsolved problems and anxious forebodings of doom into an imaginary world as innocuous as possible. They assiduously learned to drive automobiles, to play difficult card games and lose themselves in crossword puzzles\u2014for they faced death, fear, pain, and hunger almost without defenses, could no longer accept the consolations of the churches, and could obtain no useful advice from Reason. These people who read so many articles and listened to so many lectures did not take the time and trouble to strengthen themselves against fear, to combat the dread of death within themselves; they moved spasmodically on through life and had no belief in a tomorrow.","I am not going anywhere. I am only on my way.","But never forget what I have told you so often: our mission is to recognize contraries for what they are: first of all as contraries, but then as opposite poles of a unity. Such is the nature of the Glass Bead Game. The artistically inclined delight in the Game because it provides opportunities for improvisation and fantasy. The strict scholars and scientists despise it\u2014and so do some musicians also\u2014because, they say, it lacks that degree of strictness which their specialties can achieve. Well and good, you will encounter these antinomies, and in time you will discover that they are subjective, not objective\u2014that, for example, a fancy-free artist avoids pure mathematics or logic not because he understands them and could say something about them if he wished, but because he instinctively inclines toward other things. Such instinctive and violent inclinations and disinclinations are signs by which you can recognize the pettier souls. In great souls and superior minds, these passions are not found. Each of us is merely one human being, merely an experiment, a way station. But each of us should be on the way toward perfection, should be striving to reach the center, not the periphery. Remember this: one can be a strict logician or grammarian, and at the same time full of imagination and music. One can be a musician or Glass Bead Game player and at the same time wholly devoted to rule and order. The kind of person we want to develop, the kind of person we aim to become, would at any time be able to exchange his discipline or art for any other. He would infuse the Glass Bead Game with crystalline logic, and grammar with creative imagination. That is how we ought to be.","in matters of the intellect he had that calm objectivity, that certainty of thought and knowledge, such as only really intellectual men have, who have no axe to grind, who never wish to shine, or to talk others down, or to appear always in the right.","I immediately felt such dread of this new feeling that I could have fallen down before my father and kissed his feet to ask forgiveness. But one cannot apologize for something fundamental, and a child feels and knows this as well and as deeply as any sage. (p. 14)","Where was the knowledgeable one who wove his spell to bring his familiarity with the Atman out of the sleep into the state of being awake, into the life, into every step of the way, into word and deed?","Viv\xeds de modo pleno, pose\xe9is la fuerza del amor y de la intuici\xf3n.

But oh, Hardly back from the last journey The far-away tempts you yet again. Homesickness is better, To be alone under the stars with your longing. Rest and ease you can only own When the heart beats easy. But the wanderer bears the brunt of travel. His expectations are always disappointed. Yet the wanderer\u2019s troubles are easier Than peace at home. Only the wise man finds happiness Amid home\u2019s joys and cares. I would rather seek without ever finding Than be tucked and warm and tied to nearness, For in the country of happiness while on this earth, I can never be an owner, only a guest.","..ama her zaman varl\u0131kl\u0131lar\u0131n, belli bir yere k\xf6k salm\u0131\u015f ya\u015fayanlar\u0131n kar\u015f\u0131s\u0131nda onlar\u0131n ba\u015f d\xfc\u015fman\u0131 olarak yer al\u0131r, \xe7\xfcnk\xfc bu ki\u015filer g\xf6\xe7ebelerden nefret eder, onu horlar, ondan korkarlar, \xe7\xfcnk\xfc g\xf6\xe7ebe baz\u0131 tats\u0131z \u015feyleri an\u0131msat\u0131r kendilerine, t\xfcm varolu\u015fun gelip ge\xe7icili\u011fini, t\xfcm ya\u015fam\u0131n s\xfcrekli da\u011f\u0131l\u0131p d\xf6k\xfcld\xfc\u011f\xfcn\xfc, \xe7evremizdeki evreni ba\u015ftan ba\u015fa dolduran buzsu \xf6l\xfcmlerin amans\u0131zl\u0131\u011f\u0131n\u0131 an\u0131msat\u0131r.","They all belonged to each other: the lament of those who yearn, the laughter of the wise, the cry of indignation and the groan of the dying.

Un chiaro sorriso si diffuse sul volto di Vasudeva. \\"S\xec Siddharta\\" rispose. \\"Ma \xe8 questo ci\xf2 che tu vuoi dire: che il fiume si trova dovunque in ogni istante, alle sorgenti e alla foce, alla cascata, al traghetto, alle rapide, nel mare, in montagna, dovunque in ogni istante, e che per lui non vi \xe8 che presente, neanche l\'ombra del passato, neanche l\'ombra dell\'avvenire?\\". \\"S\xec, questo\\" disse Siddharta. \\"E quando l\'ebbi appreso, allora considerai la mia vita, e vidi che \xe8 anch\'essa un fiume, vidi che soltanto ombre, ma nulla di reale, separano il ragazzo Siddharta dall\'uomo Siddharta e dal vecchio Siddharta.

Truly, nothing in this world has occupied my thoughts as much as the Self, this riddle, that I live, that I am one and am separated and different from everybody else, that I am Siddhartha; and about nothing in the world do I know less than about myself, about Siddhartha.","Todos los hombres podemos llegar a entendernos perfectamente, pero comprendernos s\xf3lo cada uno lo puede hacer consigo mismo.","Writing is good, thinking is better.

Then, wolfishly seen, all human activities became horribly absurd and misplaced, stupid and vain.

Vedeva il sole sorgere sopra i monti boscosi e tramontare oltre le lontane spiagge popolate di palme. Di notte vedeva ordinarsi in cielo le stelle, e la falce della luna galleggiare come una nave nell\'azzurro. Vedeva alberi, stelle, animali, nuvole, arcobaleni, rocce, erbe, fiori, ruscelli e fiumi; vedeva la rugiada luccicare nei cespugli al mattino, alti monti azzurri e diafani nella lontananza; gli uccelli cantavano e le api ronzavano, il vento vibrava argentino nelle risaie. Tutto questo era sempre esistito nei suoi mille aspetti variopinti, sempre erano sorti il sole e la luna, sempre avevano scrosciato i torrenti e ronzato le api, ma nel passato tutto ci\xf2 non era stato per Siddharta che un velo effimero e menzognero calato davanti ai suoi occhi, considerato con diffidenza e destinato a essere trapassato e dissolto dal pensiero, poich\xe9 non era realt\xe0: la realt\xe0 era al di l\xe0 delle cose visibili. Ma ora il suo occhio liberato s\'indugiava al di qua, vedeva e riconosceva le cose visibili, cercava la sua patria in questo mondo, non cercava la \\" Realt\xe0 \\", n\xe9 aspirava ad alcun al di l\xe0. Bello era il mondo a considerarlo cos\xec: senza indagine, cos\xec semplicemente, in una disposizione di spirito infantile. Belli la luna e gli astri, belli il ruscello e le sue sponde, il bosco e la roccia, la capra e il maggiolino, fiori e farfalle. Bello e piacevole andar cos\xec per il mondo e sentirsi cosi bambino, cos\xec risvegliato, cos\xec aperto all\'immediatezza delle cose, cos\xec fiducioso. Diverso era ora l\'ardore del sole sulla pelle, diversamente fredda l\'acqua dei ruscelli e dei pozzi, altro le zucche e le banane. Brevi erano i giorni, brevi le notti, ogni ora volava via rapida come vela sul mare, e sotto la vela una barca carica di tesori, piena di gioia. Siddharta vedeva un popolo di scimmie agitarsi su tra i rami nell\'alta volta del bosco e ne udiva lo strepito selvaggio e ingordo. Siddharta vedeva un montone inseguire una pecora e congiungersi con lei. Tra le canne di una palude vedeva il luccio cacciare affannato verso sera: davanti a lui i pesciolini sciamavano a frotte rapidamente, guizzando e balenando fuor d\'acqua impauriti; un\'incalzante e appassionata energia si sprigionava dai cerchi precipitosi che l\'impetuoso cacciatore tracciava nell\'acqua. Tutto ci\xf2 era sempre stato, ed egli non l\'aveva mai visto: non vi aveva partecipato. Ma ora s\xec, vi partecipava e vi apparteneva.

What\'s the point of books when he now has the whole world within himself?","<...> kod\u0117l \u0161is meilei skirtas \u017emogus, kupinas subtili\u0173 jausm\u0173 jaunuolis, gebantis taip stipriai pajusti ir myl\u0117ti g\u0117li\u0173 kvap\u0105, ryto saul\u0119, arkl\u012f, pauk\u0161\u010dio skryd\u012f, muzik\u0105, kod\u0117l gi jis taip atkakliai siekia b\u016bti proto \u017emogumi ir asketu?","Bu ta\u015f ta\u015ft\u0131r, ayn\u0131 zamanda hayvand\u0131r, ayn\u0131 zamanda tanr\u0131d\u0131r, ayn\u0131 zamanda Buddha\'d\u0131r, ilerde \u015fu ya da bu nesneye d\xf6n\xfc\u015fece\u011fi i\xe7in ona sayg\u0131 duyuyor, onu say\u0131yor de\u011filim, \xe7oktan ve her zaman \u015fu ya da bu nesne oldu\u011fu i\xe7in sevip say\u0131yorum onu.","C\u0103ci \xeemi spun: noi, to\u021bi oamenii ace\u0219tia care vrem mai mult, noi, cei b\xe2ntui\u021bi de dor, cei care avem o dimensiune \xeen plus, n-am putea tr\u0103i defel dac\u0103 \xeen afara aerului acestei lumi n-ar mai exista \u0219i un alt aer pe care s\u0103-l respir\u0103m, dac\u0103 \xeen afar\u0103 de timp n-ar mai exista \u0219i eternitatea care, iat\u0103, nu-i altceva dec\xe2t t\u0103r\xe2mul celor adev\u0103ra\u021bi.

He went on two feet or all-fours just as the wolf ordered him, played the human being, lay for dead, let the wolf ride on his back and carried the whip after him. With the aptness of a dog he submitted gladly to every humiliation and perversion of his nature. A lovely girl came on to the stage and went up to the tamed man. She stroked his chin and rubbed her cheek against his; but he remained on all fours, remained a beast. He shook his head and began to show his teeth at the charming creature\u2014so menacingly and wolfishly at last, that she ran away. Chocolate was put before him, but with a contemptuous sniff he thrust it from him with his snout. Finally the white lamb and the fat mottled rabbit were brought on again and the docile man gave his last turn and played the wolf most amusingly. He seized the shrieking creatures in his fingers and teeth, tore them limb from limb, grinningly chewed the living flesh and rapturously drank their warm blood while his eyes closed in a dreamy delight.","Bizler uyanm\u0131\u015f ya da uyanmakta olan ki\u015filerdik; \xe7abam\u0131z, hep m\xfckemmel bir uyan\u0131kl\u0131k durumunu ele ge\xe7irmeye y\xf6nelikti.

The self-starting readers seeks answers for his life in all the books he reads, and he expects every new volume he embarks on to open up fresh horizons. Books to him are the food of life, one might even say an essential means of survival. Yet alongside this function they also have an intrinsic value as beautiful objects with which he likes to surround himself. He recommends certain books, at the very least identifying favorite books that he will read over and over, and will have rebound several times - or, should he possess an aptitude for handicraft (as Hesse did), rebinding them himself. In this way, the book collector becomes a co-creator.","These people who read so many articles and listened to so many lectures did not take the time and trouble to strengthen themselves against fear, to combat the dread of death within themselves; they moved spasmodically on through life and had no belief in a tomorrow.","el juego de amor que parece tan insaciable y sin embargo, sacia tan pronto.","And a few times he was alarmed at these thoughts and wished that it might be vouchsafed to him, as well, to take part in all the childlike activity of each day passionately and wholeheartedly, really to live, really to act, really to enjoy and to live instead of merely standing by in that way like a spectator.","He did sense very well that this love, this blind love for his son, was apassion, something very human, that it was Sansara, a murky source, darkwaters.

How could I fail to be a lone wolf, and an uncouth hermit, as I did not shareone of its aims nor understand one of its pleasures? I cannot remain for long in either theater or picture-house. I can scarcely read a paper, seldom a modern book. I cannot understand what pleasures and joys they are that drive people to the overcrowded railways and hotels, into the packed caf\xe9s with the suffocating and oppressive music, to the Bars and variety entertainments, to World Exhibitions, to the Corsos. I cannot understand nor share these joys, though they are within my reach, for which thousands of others strive. On the other hand, what happens to me in my rare hours of joy, what for me is bliss and life and ecstasy and exaltation, the world in general seeks at most in imagination; in life it finds it absurd. And in fact, if the world is right, if this music of the caf\xe9s, these mass enjoyments and these Americanised men who are pleasedwith so little are right, then I am wrong, I am crazy.

I revere them when they live in tribes and families, in forests and groves. And even more I revere them when they stand alone. They are like lonely persons. Not like hermits who have stolen away out of some weakness, but like great, solitary men, like Beethoven and Nietzsche. In their highest boughs the world rustles, their roots rest in infinity; but they do not lose themselves there, they struggle with all the force of their lives for one thing only: to fulfil themselves according to their own laws, to build up their own form, to represent themselves. Nothing is holier, nothing is more exemplary than a beautiful, strong tree. When a tree is cut down and reveals its naked death-wound to the sun, one can read its whole history in the luminous, inscribed disk of its trunk: in the rings of its years, its scars, all the struggle, all the suffering, all the sickness, all the happiness and prosperity stand truly written, the narrow years and the luxurious years, the attacks withstood, the storms endured.","He yearned to know nothing more about himself, to find peace, to be dead.","THE DAY HAD GONE BY JUST AS DAYS GO BY.

Three times the mail had come with undesired letters and circulars to look through. I had done my breathing exercises, but found it convenient today to omit the thought exercises. I had been for an hour\'s walk and seen the loveliest feathery cloud patterns penciled against the sky. That was very delightful. So was the reading of the old books. So was the lying in the warm bath. But, taken all in all, it had not been exactly a day of rapture. No, it had not even been a day brightened with happiness and joy. Rather, it had been just one of those days which for a long while now had fallen to my lot; the moderately pleasant, the wholly bearable and tolerable, lukewarm days of a discontented middle-aged man; days without special pains, without special cares, without particular worry, without despair; days when I calmly wonder, objective and fearless, whether it isn\'t time to follow the example of Adalbert Stifter and have an accident while shaving.","This it is, said Siddhartha. \u201cAnd when I had learned it, I looked at my life, and it was also a river, and the boy Siddhartha was only separated from the man Siddhartha and from the old man Siddhartha by a shadow, not by something real.

It take hold of some music played where you please, without distinction or discretion, lamentably distorted, to boot, and chucks it into space to land where it has no business to be; and yet after all this it cannot destroy the spirit of the music; it can only, however it may meddle and mar, lay its senseless mechanism at its feet.

It had been for all its wretchedness a princely life. Let the little way to death be as it might, the kernel of this life of mine was noble. It had purpose and character and turned not on trifles, but on the stars.

Nevertheless, he felt at the same time, it was not worthless, it was necessary, came from the essence of his own being. This pleasure also had to be atoned for, this pain also had to be endured, these foolish acts also had to be committed.","Kada mislim na Firencu, kao prvu sliku ne vidim katedralu ili palatu Sinjorije, ve\u0107 jezerce sa zlatnim kara\u0161ima u Gardino Boboliju, gde sam prvog mog popodneva u Firenci razgovarao sa nekim \u017eenama i njihovom decom, prvi put \u010duo florentinski jezik i grad koji mi je bio poznat iz mnogih knjiga po prvi put osetio kao ne\u0161to stvarno i \u017eivo sa \u010dim mogu da pri\u010dam i \u0161to sam mogao da uhvatim rukama.

All these bores and cowards who grind away and work their fingers to the bone and don\'t realize that there\'s something higher than the Hebrew alphabet. You\'re no different.\\"Hans kept silent. This Heilner fellow certainly was a strange one. A romantic, a poet. As everyone knew, he worked hardly at all and still he knew quite a bit, he knew how to give good answers, and at the same time despised his learning.\u201cWe\'re reading Homer,\\" he went on in the same mocking tone, \\"as though the Odyssey were a cookbook. Two verses an hour and then the whole thing is masticated word by word and inspected until you\'re ready to throw up. But at the end of the hour the professor will say: \'Notice how nicely the poet has turned this phrase! This has afforded you an insight into the secret of poetic creativity!\' Just like a little icing around the aorists and particles so you won\'t choke on them completely. I don\'t have any use for that kind of Homer. Anyway, what does all this old Greek stuff matter to us? If one of us ever tried to live a little like a Greek, he\'d be out on his tail. And our room is called \'Hellas\'! Pure mockery! Why isn\'t it called \'wastepaper basket\' or \'monkey cage\' or \'sweatshop\'? All this classical stuff is a big fake.","For it is the same indivisible divinity that is active through us and in Nature, and if the outside world were to be destroyed, a single one of us would be capable of rebuilding it: mountain and stream, tree and leaf, root and flower, yes, every natural form is latent within us, originates in the soul whose essence is eternity, whose essence we cannot know but which often intimates itself to us as the power to love and create.","el desesperado no querer morir, es el camino m\xe1s seguro para la muerte eterna, en tanto que saber morir, rasgar el velo del arcano, ir buscando eternamente mutaciones al yo conduce a la inmortalidad.","A seriedade, meu rapaz, tem a ver com o tempo, nasce, que te digo eu, de uma sobrestima\xe7\xe3o do tempo.","I do want something more.

I had more than my fair share of unhappiness but my unhappiness was stupid, barren... Because if I wanted to die, and I did, I ought not to have been so afraid of death. The unhappiness I\u2019m in need of and longing for is different. It\u2019s of a kind that will make me hunger for suffering and lust for death. That\u2019s the sort of unhappiness, or happiness, I am waiting for.There is nothing wrong with this happiness. On the contrary, I love it, feel grateful for it. It\u2019s as beautiful as a sunny day in a summer of rain. But I sense that it can\u2019t last, so it is barren too, this happiness. It is satisfying, but satisfaction is not the nourishment I need. It\u2019s enough to fill Steppenwolf\u2019s stomach and send him to sleep, but it\u2019s not the kind of happiness to die for.I am very satisfied with my happiness. It\u2019s something I can live with for quite a while yet, but if it occasionally deserts me for an hour or so, allowing me to wake from my sleep and experience a longing for something, what I long for with all my being is not this happiness, not that it should last for ever. Rather, I long to experience suffering again, only more exquisitely, more richly this time.

I felt I could not love a person here and hate another person there. I was ashamed of my lack of understanding and saw clearly for the first time in my young life that one could not go through life and amongst people so simply, hating one person and loving another, respecting one person and despising another, but all this emotions were closely tied up, hardly separable and at times hardly distinguishable.","You can\'t compare yourself with others: if Nature has made you a bat you shouldn\'t try to be an ostrich.","He was a good, even a shining light as a Castalian to the extent that he had a many-sided mind, tirelessly active in scholarship as well as in the art of the Glass Bead Game, and enormously hard-working; but in character, in his attitude toward the hierarchy and the morality of the Order he was a very mediocre, not to say bad Castalian. The greatest of his vices was a persistent neglect of meditation, which he refused to take seriously. The purpose of meditation, after all, is adaptation of the individual to the hierarchy, and application in it might very well have cured him of his neurasthenia. For it infallibly helped him whenever, after a period of bad conduct, excessive excitement, or melancholia, his superiors disciplined him by prescribing strict meditation exercises under supervision. Even Knecht, kindly disposed and forgiving though he was, frequently had to resort to this measure.  There was no question about it: Tegularius was a willful, moody person who refused to fit into his society. Every so often he would display the liveliness of his intellect. When highly stimulated he could be entrancing; his mordant wit sparkled and he overwhelmed everyone with the audacity and richness of his sometimes somber inspirations. But basically he was incurable, for he did not want to be cured; he cared nothing for co-ordination and a place in the scheme of things. He loved nothing but his freedom, his perpetual student status, and preferred spending his whole life as the unpredictable and obstinate loner, the gifted fool and nihilist, to following the path of subordination to the hierarchy and thus attaining peace. He cared nothing for peace, had no regard for the hierarchy, hardly minded reproof and isolation. Certainly he was a most inconvenient and indigestible component in a community whose idea was harmony and orderliness. But because of this very troublesomeness and indigestiblity he was, in the midst of such a limpid and prearranged little world, a constant source of vital unrest, a reproach, an admonition and warning, a spur to new, bold, forbidden, intrepid ideas, an unruly, stubborn sheep in the herd. And, to our mind, this was the very reason his friend cherished him.","\u0406\u0441\u043d\u0443\u0454 \u0431\u0430\u0433\u0430\u0442\u043e \u0448\u043b\u044f\u0445\u0456\u0432, \u044f\u043a\u0438\u043c\u0438 \u0411\u043e\u0433 \u043c\u043e\u0436\u0435 \u0437\u0440\u043e\u0431\u0438\u0442\u0438 \u043d\u0430\u0441 \u0441\u0430\u043c\u043e\u0442\u043d\u0456\u043c\u0438 \u0456 \u043f\u0440\u0438\u0432\u0435\u0441\u0442\u0438 \u0434\u043e \u0441\u0430\u043c\u0438\u0445 \u0441\u0435\u0431\u0435.(\u0415\u043c\u0456\u043b\u044c \u0421\u0456\u043d\u043a\u043b\u0435\u0440)","Au peu d\u2019exp\xe9riences que j\u2019avais faites jusqu\u2019\xe0 pr\xe9sent sur le chemin de moi-m\xeame, s\u2019ajouta celle-ci : la contemplation des formes \xe9tranges, confuses, irrationnelles de la nature fait na\xeetre en nous le sentiment de l\u2019harmonie qui existe entre notre \xe2me et la volont\xe9 qui laissa ces formes se cr\xe9er.

But it matters little that you suffer, so long as you feel alive with a sense of the close bond that connects all living things, so long as love does not die! I would gladly exchange every happy day of my life, all my infatuations and great plans, provided I could exchange them for gazing deeply once more into this most sacred experience. It bitterly hurts your eyes and heart, and your pride and self-esteem don\'t get off scot-free either, but afterwards you feel so calm and serene, so much wiser and alive.","On adore en Dieu le P\xe8re de toute vie et, d\u2019autre part, l\u2019on tait purement et simplement la vie sexuelle sur laquelle repose pourtant l\u2019existence elle-m\xeame, et on d\xe9clare qu\u2019elle est p\xe9ch\xe9 et \u0153uvre du Diable.","Why did he, the irreproachable one, have to wash off sins every day, strive for a cleansing every day, over and over every day?","Perhaps that is what prevents you from finding peace, perhaps it is all those words.","Come, he called after a while, \u201clet\u2019s practice a little philosophy now; that is, let\u2019s shut up, lie on our stomachs, and think.\u201d","[N]ature could not care less what we think about it[.]","Zaman a\u015f\u0131l\u0131r a\u015f\u0131lmaz, zaman d\xfc\u015f\xfcncesi kafadan \xe7\u0131kar\u0131l\u0131r \xe7\u0131kar\u0131lmaz d\xfcnyadaki b\xfcy\xfck g\xfc\xe7l\xfckler, b\xfct\xfcn d\xfc\u015fmanl\u0131klar silinip gitmiyor mu, yenilgiye u\u011frat\u0131lm\u0131yor muydu?","He locked the gate, sat down under a mango tree, and felt death in his heart and horror in his chest.

Of course two peoples and two languages will never be able to communicate with each other so intimately as two individuals who belong to the same nation and speak the same language. But that is no reason to forgo the effort at communication. Within nations there are also barriers which stand in the way of complete communication and complete mutual understanding, barriers of culture, education, talent, individuality. It might be asserted that every human being on earth can fundamentally hold a dialogue with every other human being, and it might also be asserted that there are no two persons in the world between whom genuine, whole, intimate understanding is possible - the one statement is as true as the other. It is Yin and Yang, day and night; both are right and at times we have to be reminded of both. To be sure, I too do not believe that you and I will ever be able to communicate fully, and without some residue of misunderstanding, with each other. But though you may be an occidental and I a Chinese, though we may speak different languages, if we are men of good will we shall have a great deal to say to each other, and beyond what is precisely communicable we can guess and sense a great deal about each other.

Isn\'t it artificial, sterilized, didactically pruned world, a mere sham world in which you cravenly vegetate, a world without vices, without passions, without hunger, without sap and salt, a world without family, without mothers, without children, almost without women? The instinctual life is tamed by meditation. For generations you have left to others dangerous, daring, and responsible things like economics, law, and politics. Cowardly and well-protected, fed by others, and having few burdensome duties, you lead your drones\' lives, and so that they won\'t be too boring you busy yourselves with all these erudite specialties, count syllables and letters, make music, and play the Glass Bead Game, while outside in the filth of the world poor harried people live real lives and do real work.","\u042f\u043a\u0449\u043e \u0442\u0432\u0430\u0440\u0438\u043d\u0430 \u0430\u0431\u043e \u043b\u044e\u0434\u0438\u043d\u0430 \u0432\u0441\u044e \u0441\u0432\u043e\u044e \u0443\u0432\u0430\u0433\u0443 \u0456 \u0432\u0441\u044e \u0441\u0432\u043e\u044e \u0432\u043e\u043b\u044e \u0441\u043f\u0440\u044f\u043c\u0443\u0454 \u043d\u0430 \u043f\u0435\u0432\u043d\u0443 \u043c\u0435\u0442\u0443 - \u0432\u043e\u043d\u0430 \u0457\u0457 \u0439 \u0434\u043e\u0441\u044f\u0433\u043d\u0435. \u041e\u0442 \u0456 \u0432\u0441\u0435.(\u041c\u0430\u043a\u0441 \u0414\u0435\u043c\u0456\u0430\u043d)","\u041c\u0438 \u0441\u0442\u0432\u043e\u0440\u044e\u0454\u043c\u043e \u0441\u043e\u0431\u0456 \u0440\u0456\u0437\u043d\u0438\u0445 \u0431\u043e\u0433\u0456\u0432 \u0456 \u0447\u0430\u0441\u043e\u043c \u0431\u043e\u0440\u0435\u043c\u043e\u0441\u044f \u0437 \u043d\u0438\u043c\u0438, \u0430 \u0447\u0430\u0441\u043e\u043c \u0432\u043e\u043d\u0438 \u0431\u043b\u0430\u0433\u043e\u0441\u043b\u043e\u0432\u043b\u044f\u044e\u0442\u044c \u043d\u0430\u0441...(\u0415\u043c\u0456\u043b\u044c \u0421\u0456\u043d\u043a\u043b\u0435\u0440)","La misi\xf3n verdadera de cada uno era llegar a s\xed mismo.","\u0628\u0648\u062f\u0627 \u0628\u0631\u062e\u0627\u0633\u062a \u0648 \u0631\u0641\u062a \u0648 \u0646\u06af\u0627\u0647 \u0627\u0648 \u0648 \u0646\u06cc\u0645\u0647 \u062a\u0628\u0633\u0645\u0634 \u062f\u0631 \u062e\u0627\u0637\u0631\u0647 \u0633\u06cc\u0630\u0627\u0631\u062a\u0627 \u0628\u0631\u0627\u06cc \u0647\u0645\u06cc\u0634\u0647 \u0646\u0642\u0634 \u0628\u0633\u062a. \u0648\u06cc \u0641\u06a9\u0631 \u06af\u0631\u062f \u06a9\u0647 \u0645\u0646 \u062f\u06cc\u06af\u0631 \u0647\u06cc\u0686\u06af\u0627\u0647 \u0645\u0631\u062f\u06cc \u0631\u0627 \u0628\u062f\u06cc\u0646\u06af\u0648\u0646\u0647 \u062a\u0628\u0633\u0645 \u0648 \u0646\u06af\u0627\u0647 \u06a9\u0646\u062f \u0648 \u0627\u06cc\u0646 \u0637\u0648\u0631 \u0628\u0646\u0634\u06cc\u0646\u062f \u0646\u062e\u0648\u0627\u0647\u0645 \u062f\u06cc\u062f. \u0645\u0646 \u0647\u0645 \u0645\u06cc \u062e\u0648\u0627\u0647\u0645 \u06a9\u0647 \u0628\u062f\u0627\u0646 \u0634\u06a9\u0644 \u0628\u0627\u0634\u0645. \u0628\u062f\u0627\u0646\u06af\u0648\u0646\u0647 \u062a\u0628\u0633\u0645 \u06a9\u0646\u0645 \u0648 \u0628\u062f\u0627\u0646\u06af\u0648\u0646\u0647 \u0628\u0646\u0634\u06cc\u0646\u0645\u060c \u0622\u0646 \u0642\u062f\u0631 \u0622\u0632\u0627\u062f\u060c \u0648\u0627\u0631\u0633\u062a\u0647\u060c \u0635\u0627\u0641\u060c \u0633\u0627\u062f\u0647\u060c \u06a9\u0648\u062f\u06a9 \u0648\u0627\u0631 \u0648 \u0645\u0631\u0645\u0648\u0632 \u0628\u0627\u0634\u0645. \u0634\u062e\u0635 \u062f\u0631 \u0635\u0648\u0631\u062a\u06cc \u0645\u06cc \u062a\u0648\u0627\u0646\u062f \u0628\u062f\u06cc\u0646 \u0634\u06a9\u0644 \u062f\u0631 \u0622\u06cc\u062f \u0648 \u06cc\u0627 \u0628\u062f\u06cc\u0646\u06af\u0648\u0646\u0647 \u0631\u0627\u0647 \u0628\u0631\u0648\u062f \u06a9\u0647 \u062e\u0648\u062f \u0631\u0627 \u0645\u0633\u062e\u0631 \u06a9\u0631\u062f\u0647 \u0628\u0627\u0634\u062f\u060c \u0645\u0646 \u0646\u06cc\u0632 \u062e\u0648\u062f \u0631\u0627 \u062a\u0633\u062e\u06cc\u0631 \u062e\u0648\u0627\u0647\u0645 \u06a9\u0631\u062f.","\u041f\u0440\u0438\u0434\u0438\u0432\u0438\u0441\u044f \u0434\u043e \u043b\u044e\u0434\u0438\u043d\u0438 \u0434\u043e\u0441\u0438\u0442\u044c \u0443\u0432\u0430\u0436\u043d\u043e - \u0456 \u0442\u0438 \u0431\u0443\u0434\u0435\u0448 \u0437\u043d\u0430\u0442\u0438 \u043f\u0440\u043e \u043d\u0435\u0457 \u0431\u0456\u043b\u044c\u0448\u0435, \u043d\u0456\u0436 \u0432\u043e\u043d\u0430 \u0441\u0430\u043c\u0430.(\u041c\u0430\u043a\u0441 \u0414\u0435\u043c\u0456\u0430\u043d)","A veces nos cont\xe1bamos mutuamente nuestros sue\xf1os.

It is a longing for home, for a memory of the mother, for new metaphors for life. It leads home. Every path leads homeward, every step is birth, every step is death, every grave is mother.So the tree rustles in the evening, when we stand uneasy before our own childish thoughts: Trees have long thoughts, long-breathing and restful, just as they have longer lives than ours. They are wiser than we are, as long as we do not listen to them. But when we have learned how to listen to trees, then the brevity and the quickness and the childlike hastiness of our thoughts achieve an incomparable joy.

Seeking means: to have a goal; but finding means: to be free, to be receptive, to have no goal.\u201d","Penetrare il mondo, spiegarlo, disprezzarlo, pu\xf2 essere l\'opera dei grandi filosofi. Ma a me importa solo di poter amare il mondo, non disprezzarlo, non odiare il mondo e me; a me importa solo di poter considerare il mondo, e me e tutti gli essere, con amore, ammirazione e rispetto.","What is meditation? What is leaving one\u2019s body? . . . It is fleeing from the self. . . The same escape, the same short numbing is what the driver of an ox-cart finds in the inn, drinking a few bowls of rice-wine. . .","Ordinarily, when he thought back upon those days, let alone upon his student years and the Bamboo Grove, it had always been as if he were gazing from a cool, dull room out into broad, brightly sunlit landscapes, into the irrevocable past, the paradise of memory. Such recollections had always been, even when they were free of sadness, a vision of things remote and different, separated from the prosaic present by a mysterious festiveness. But now, on this bright and cheerful September afternoon, with the strong greens and browns all around him and the ethereal, gently misted tones of blues verging into violet in the distance, as he trudged along at an easy pace, with frequent pauses to look about him, that walking tour of so long ago did not seem a distant paradise cut off from a resigned present. rather his present journey was the same as that of the past, the present Joseph Knecht was close as a brother to the Knecht of those days. Everything was new again, mysterious, promising; all that had been could recur, and many new things as well. It was long, long since he had looked out upon the day and the world and seen them as so unburdened, so beautiful and innocent. The happiness of freedom, of commanding his own destiny, flooded through him like a strong drink. How long it was since he had last had this feeling, last entertained this lovely and rapturous illusion.","\u041c\u0438 \u0437\u0430\u0432\u0436\u0434\u0438

moment, where the world melted away all around him, where he appeared as the sole star in the sky, out of this moment of chill and dejection, Siddhartha emerged, more I than before, more tightly gathered in.

And instantly he set out again, starting to walk quickly and impatiently, no longer toward home, no longer to his father, no longer back.","Nefret etti\u011fim iki \u015fey aras\u0131nda se\xe7im yapmak zorunday\u0131m - ya akl\u0131m\u0131n tiksindi\u011fi d\xfc\u015fleri se\xe7ece\u011fim ya da duyular\u0131m\u0131 deh\u015fete d\xfc\u015f\xfcren eylemi; ba\u015fka bir deyi\u015fle, hamurumda hissedemedi\u011fim eylem ya da \u015fimdiye kadar hi\xe7 kimsenin mayas\u0131nda olmayan d\xfc\u015f.","And if time is not real, then the span that seems to lie between world and eternity, between sorrow and bliss, between evil and good is also an illusion.","If this disgraceful behaviour was a common feature of human nature, I was justified in hurling my contempt in humanity\'s face with even greater force than before; if it was just a personal weakness, then I had reason to indulge in an orgy of self-contempt.","When a person seeks, Siddhartha said, \u201cit can easily happen that his eye sees only the thing he is seeking; he is incapable of finding anything, of allowing anything to enter into him, because he is always thinking only of what he is looking for, because he has a goal, because he is possessed by his goal.

Every so often he would display the liveliness of his intellect. When highly stimulated he could be entrancing; his mordant wit sparkled and he overwhelmed everyone with the audacity and richness of his sometimes somber inspirations. But basically he was incurable, for he did not want to be cured; he cared nothing for co-ordination and a place in the scheme of things. He loved nothing but his freedom, his perpetual student status, and preferred spending his whole life as the unpredictable and obstinate loner, the gifted fool and nihilist, to following the path of subordination to the hierarchy and thus attaining peace. He cared nothing for peace, had no regard for the hierarchy, hardly minded reproof and isolation. Certainly he was a most inconvenient and indigestible component in a community whose idea was harmony and orderliness. But because of this very troublesomeness and indigestibility he was, in the midst of such a limpid and prearranged little world, a constant source of vital unrest, a reproach, an admonition and warning, a spur to new, bold, forbidden, intrepid ideas, an unruly, stubborn sheep in the herd. And, to our mind, this was the very reason his friend cherished him.","Versenkung und Weisheit waren gute, waren edle Dinge, aber es schien, sie gediehen nur abseits, am Rande des Lebens, und wer im Strom des Lebens schwamm und mit seinen Wellen k\xe4mpfte, dessen Taten und Leiden hatten nichts mit der Weisheit zu tun, sie ergaben sich, waren Verh\xe4ngnis, mu\xdften getan und erlitten sein.","\u0426\u0435 \u0432\u0435\u043b\u0438\u043a\u0430 \u0440\u0456\u0437\u043d\u0438\u0446\u044f - \u0447\u0438 \u0432\u0438 \u0442\u0456\u043b\u044c\u043a\u0438 \u043d\u043e\u0441\u0438\u0442\u0435 \u0441\u0432\u0456\u0442 \u0443 \u0441\u043e\u0431\u0456, \u0447\u0438 \u0432\u0438 \u0449\u0435 \u0439 \u0446\u0435 \u0437\u043d\u0430\u0454\u0442\u0435!(\u041f\u0456\u0441\u0442\u043e\u0440\u0456\u0443\u0441)","- \u041d\u0430\u0440\u043e\u0434\u0436\u0443\u0432\u0430\u0442\u0438\u0441\u044f \u0437\u0430\u0432\u0436\u0434\u0438 \u0432\u0430\u0436\u043a\u043e. \u0412\u0438 \u0437\u043d\u0430\u0454\u0442\u0435, \u0449\u043e \u043f\u0442\u0430\u0445 \u043d\u0430\u0441\u0438\u043b\u0443 \u0432\u0438\u043b\u0443\u043f\u043b\u044e\u0454\u0442\u044c\u0441\u044f \u0437 \u044f\u0439\u0446\u044f? \u0410\u043b\u0435 \u0437\u0433\u0430\u0434\u0430\u0439\u0442\u0435 \u043c\u0438\u043d\u0443\u043b\u0435 \u0456 \u0437\u0430\u043f\u0438\u0442\u0430\u0439\u0442\u0435 \u0441\u0435\u0431\u0435: \u0447\u0438 \u0442\u0456\u043b\u044c\u043a\u0438 \u0432\u0430\u0436\u043a\u0438\u0439 \u0431\u0443\u0432 \u0432\u0430\u0448 \u0448\u043b\u044f\u0445? \u041c\u043e\u0436\u0435, \u0432\u0456\u043d \u0431\u0443\u0432 \u0437\u0430\u0440\u0430\u0437\u043e\u043c \u0456 \u043f\u0440\u0435\u043a\u0440\u0430\u0441\u043d\u0438\u0439? \u0412\u0438 \u043c\u043e\u0433\u043b\u0438 \u0431 \u0443\u044f\u0432\u0438\u0442\u0438 \u044f\u043a\u0438\u0439\u0441\u044c \u043a\u0440\u0430\u0449\u0438\u0439, \u043b\u0435\u0433\u0448\u0438\u0439?

Too much knowledge had hindered him; too many holy verses, too many sacrificial rites, too much mortification of the flesh, too much doing and striving. He had been full of arrogance; he had always been the cleverest, the most eager\u2014always a step ahead of the others, always the learned and intellectual one, always the priest or the sage. His Self had crawled into this priesthood, into this arrogance, into this intellectuality. It sat there tightly and grew, while he thought he was destroying it by fasting and penitence. Now he understood it and realized that the inward voice had been right, that no teacher could have brought him salvation. That was why he had to go into the world, to lose himself in power, women and money; that was why he had to be a merchant, a dice player, a drinker and a man of property, until the priest and Samana in him were dead. That was why he had to undergo those horrible years, suffer nausea, learn the lesson of the madness of an empty, futile life till the end, till he reached bitter despair, so that Siddhartha the pleasure-monger and Siddhartha the man of property could die. He had died and a new Siddhartha had awakened from his sleep.","La belleza no hac\xeda feliz al que la ten\xeda, sino al que sab\xeda amarla y venerarla","Tito looked eagerly toward the dark crest of the mountain, behind which the sky pulsed in the morning light. Now a fragment of the rocky ridge flashed violently like a glowing metal beginning to melt. The crest blurred and seemed suddenly lower, as if it were melting down, and from the fiery gap the dazzling sun appeared. Simultaneously, the ground, the house, and their shore of the lake were illuminated, and the two, standing in the strong radiance, instantly felt the delightful warmth of this light. The boy, filled with the solemn beauty of the moment and the glorious sensation of his youth and strength, stretched his limbs with rhythmic arm movements, which his whole body soon took up, celebrating the break of day in an enthusiastic dance and expressing his deep oneness with the surging, radiant elements. His steps flew in joyous homage toward the victorious sun and reverently retreated from it; his outspread arms embraced mountain, lake, and sky; kneeling, he seemed to pay tribute to the earth mother, and extending his hands, to the waters of the lake; he offered himself, his youth, his freedom, his burning sense of is own life, like a festive sacrifice to the powers. The sunlight gleamed on his tanned shoulders; his eyes were half-closed to the dazzle; his young face stared masklike with an expression of inspired, almost fanatical gravity.","...\u0432\u0430\u0448\u0430 \u0434\u043e\u043b\u044f \u0434\u043e \u0432\u0430\u0441 \u043f\u0440\u0438\u0445\u0438\u043b\u044c\u043d\u0430... \u041a\u043e\u043b\u0438-\u043d\u0435\u0431\u0443\u0434\u044c \u0432\u0430\u0448\u0430 \u043c\u0440\u0456\u044f \u043d\u0430\u043b\u0435\u0436\u0430\u0442\u0438\u043c\u0435 \u043b\u0438\u0448\u0435 \u0432\u0430\u043c \u0446\u0456\u043b\u043a\u043e\u0432\u0438\u0442\u043e, \u044f\u043a \u0432\u0438 \u0446\u044c\u043e\u0433\u043e \u0439 \u043f\u0440\u0430\u0433\u043d\u0435\u0442\u0435, \u044f\u043a\u0449\u043e \u0432\u0438 \u0437\u0430\u043b\u0438\u0448\u0430\u0442\u0438\u043c\u0435\u0442\u0435\u0441\u044f \u0432\u0456\u0440\u043d\u0438\u043c \u0457\u0439...

Someone from the Middle Ages would still find the whole style of our present-day life abhorrent, but cruel, horrifying and barbaric in a quite different way. Every age, every culture, every ethos and tradition has a style of its own, has the varieties of gentleness and harshness, of beauty and cruelty that are appropriate to it. Each age will take certain kinds of suffering for granted, will patiently accept certain wrongs. Human life becomes a real hell of suffering only when two ages, two cultures and religions overlap. Required to live in the Middle Ages, someone from the Graeco-Roman period would have died a wretched death by suffocation, just as a savage inevitably would in the midst our civilisation. Now, there are times when a whole generation gets caught to such an extent between two eras, two styles of life, that nothing comes naturally to it since it has lost all sense of morality, security and innocence. A man of Nietzsche\'s mettle had to endure our present misery more than a generation in advance.

This is why we need another kind of education beside the intellectual and submit ourselves to the morality of the Order, not in order to reshape our mentally active life into a psychically vegetative dream-life, but on the contrary to make ourselves fit for the summit of intellectual achievement.

Such was the case with the peace Josephus Famulus enjoyed. It was unstable, visible one moment, gone the next, sometimes near as a candle carried in the hand, sometimes as remote as a star in the wintry sky. And in time a new and special kind of sin and temptation more and more often made life difficult for him. It was not a strong, passionate emotion such as indignation or a sudden rush of instinctual urges. Rather, it seemed to be the opposite. It was a feeling very easy to bear in its initial stages, for it was scarcely perceptible; a condition without any real pain or deprivation, a slack, luke-warm, tedious state of the soul which could only be described in negative terms as a vanishing, a waning, and finally a complete absence of joy. There are days when the sun does not shine and the rain does not pour, but the sky sinks quietly into itself, wraps itself up, is gray but not black, sultry, but not with the tension of an imminent thunderstorm. Gradually, Joseph\'s days became like this as he approached old age. Less and less could he distinguish the mornings from the evenings, feast days from ordinary days, hours of rapture from hours of dejection. Everything ran sluggishly long in limp tedium and joylessness. This is old age, he thought sadly. He was sad because he had expected aging and the gradual extinction of his passions to bring a brightening and easing of his life, to take him a step nearer to harmony and mature peace of soul, and now age seemed to be disappointing and cheating him by offering nothing but this weary, gray, joyless emptiness, this feeling of chronic satiation. Above all he felt sated: by sheer existence, by breathing, by sleep at night, by life in his cave on the edge of the little oasis, by the eternal round of evenings and mornings, by the passing of travelers and pilgrims, camel riders and donkey riders, and most of all by the people who came to visit him, by those foolish, anxious, and childishly credulous people who had this craving to tell him about their lives, their sins and their fears, their temptations and self-accusations. Sometimes it all seemed to him like the small spring of water that collected in its stone basin in the oasis, flowed through grass for a while, forming a small brook, and then flowed on out into the desert sands, where after a brief course it dried up and vanished. Similarly, all these confessions, these inventories of sins, these lives, these torments of conscience, big and small, serious and vain, all of them came pouring into his ear, by the dozens, by the hundreds, more and more of them. But his ear was not dead like the desert sands. His ear was alive and could not drink, swallow, and absorb forever. It felt fatigued, abused, glutted. It longed for the flow and splashing of words, confessions, anxieties, charges, self-condemnations to cease; it longed for peace, death, and stillness to take the place of this endless flow.","Without words, without wrting and without books there would be no history, there could be no concept of humanity.","\u010cia reikia pridurti, jog klaidinga vadinti savi\u017eud\u017eiais tik tuos \u017emones, kurie i\u0161 tikr\u0173j\u0173 nusi\u017eudo.

Aren\'t the Samanas entirely without possessions?\\" \\"I am without possessions,\\" said Siddhartha, \\"if this is what you mean. Surely, I am without possessions. But I am so voluntarily, and therefore I am not destitute.","But every man is more than just himself; he also represents the unique, the very special and always significant and remarkable point at which the world\'s phenomena intersect, only oncein this way and never again. That is why every man\'s story is important, eternal, sacred; that is why every man,as long as he lives and fulfills the will of nature, is wondrous, and worthy of every consideration. In each individual the spirit has become flesh, in each man the creation suffers, within each one a redeemer is nailed to the cross. Few people nowadays know what man is. Many sense this ignorance and die the more easilybecause of it, the same way that I will die more easily once I have completed this story. \\tI do not considermyself less ignorant than most people. I have been and still am a seeker, but I have ceased to question starsand books; I have begun to listen to the teachings my blood whispers to me. My story is not a pleasant one; itis neither sweet nor harmonious, as invented stories are; it has the taste of nonsense and chaos, of madness anddreams--like the lives of all men who stop deceiving themselves. \\tEach man\'s life represents a road towardhimself, an attempt at such a road, the intimation of a path. No man has ever been entirely and completelyhimself. Yet each one strives to become that--one in an awkward, the other in a more intelligent way, each asbest he can. Each man carries the vestiges of his birth--the slime and eggshells of his primeval past--with himto the end of his days. Some never become human, remaining frog, lizard, ant. Some are human above thewaist, fish below. Each represents a gamble on the part of nature in creation of the human. We all share thesame origin, our mothers; all of us come in at the same door. But each of us--experiments of thedepths--strives toward his own destiny. We can understand one another; but each of us is able to interprethimself to himself alone.","Dentro de cada hombre podemos encontrar un esp\xedritu que sufre y que se crucifica; asimismo, en cada crucifixi\xf3n podemos encontrar a un salvador.","Ah, were not all sufferings then time, and were not all self-torments and personal fears time? Weren\u2019t all the difficult and hostile things in the world gone and overcome as soon as one had overcome time, and as soon as time could be thrust out of the mind?","He already understood how to speak the \u201cOm silently, that word of words, how to speak it silently in his inner being as he inhaled, how to pronounce it silently out of himself as he exhaled, how to do so with his whole soul while his forehead was enveloped by the radiance of the clear-thinking mind. He already understood how to recognize Atman within this inner essence of his that was indestructible and one with the universe.\u201d","Govinda zei: \\"Maar is dat, wat jij \'ding\' noemt dan iets wat werkelijk bestaat, iets wat wezenlijk is? Is dat niet alleen begoocheling van de Maya, alleen maar verbeeldsel en schijn? Jouw steen, jouw boom, jouw stroom - zijn dat nu dingen die waarachtig bestaan?\' \'Ook daarom,\' zei Siddhartha, \'bekommer ik mij niet zo erg, Of die dingen nu schijn zijn of niet, als zij schijn zijn, dan ben ik dat ook, en op die manier zijn ze toch altijd gelijk aan mij. Dat is het juist waardoor ze mij zo lief en zo eerbiedwaardig worden: zij zijn zoals ik. Dat is de reden waarom ik van ze houden kan En dit is nu weer zo\'n leer, waarom je wel zult lachen: de liefde, Govinda, schijnt mij het belangrijkst van alles te zijn. De wereld te doorgronden, haar verklaren, haar verachten, dat laat ik graag aan grote denkers over. Voor mij is het alleen van belang dat ik van die wereld kan houden, haar niet hoef te verachten, haar en mijzelf niet hoef te haten, haar en mijzelf, en alles wat bestaat, met liefde, bewondering, en eerbied beschouwen kan.","Wissen kann man mitteilen, Weisheit aber nicht. Man kann sie finden, man kann sie leben, man kann von ihr getragen werden, man kann mit ihr Wunder tun, aber sagen und lehren kann man sie nicht.","Izme\u0111u Bremena i Nepala, izme\u0111u Be\u010da i Singapura video sam mnogo lepih gradova, gradove na moru i gradove visoko u brdima, sa mnogih izvora sam kao hodo\u010dasnik pio, od \u010dega je kasnije nastajao slatki otrov nostalgije. Ali najlep\u0161i grad od svih koje znam je Kalv na Nagoldu, mali, stari \u0161vapski gradi\u0107 ispod \u0160varcvalda. Kada do\u0111em u Kalv, idem polako od \u017eelezi\u010dke stanice nadole, pored katoli\u010dke crkve, pored \u201cOrla i \u201c\u0160umskog roga\u201d, kroz Biskupovu ulicu pored Nagolda, pored Vajn\u0161tega ili do bara, onda preko reke i kroz donju Leder-uli\u010dicu, pa kroz jednu strmu, popre\u010dnu, gore od trga, ispod trema ve\u0107nice, pored dva jaka stara izvora, bacim pogled prema starim zgradama Latinske \u0161kole, u kr\u010dmarevoj ba\u0161ti \u010dujem koko\u0161ke kako kokoda\u010du, okrenem se i idem ponovo nadole, pored \u201cJelena\u201d i \u201cKonji\u0107a\u201d, a onda dugo stojim na mostu. To mi je najomiljenije mesto u gradi\u0107u, trg pored katedrale u firenci nije ni\u0161ta u pore\u0111enju sa njim. Sada, kad sa lepog kamenog mosta gledam gore i dole, vidim ku\u0107e du\u017e reke, a ne znam ko u njima \u017eivi. I kada iz jedne od njih gleda lpa devojka (kojih je u Kalvu uvek bilo), ja ne znam kako se zove. A pre trideset godina, iza svih ovih prozora nije bilo nijedne devojke i nijednog \u010doveka, nijedne stare \u017eene, nijednog psa i nijedne ma\u010dke koju nisam znao. Nisu preko mosta pre\u0161la nijedna kola i nije kaskalo nijedno kljuse za koje nisam znao \u010diji su. A tako sam znao sve, mnoge \u0161kolske drugove i njihove igre i podrugljive nadimke, pekarske radnje i njihovu robu, mesare i njihove pse, drve\u0107e, i gundelje, i ptice, i gnezda, vrste ogrozda u ba\u0161tama. Upravo je zbog toga grad Kalv imao svoju jedinstvenu lepotu. Nema potrebe da ga opisujem, to stoji u skoro svim knjigama koje sam napisao. Da sam ostao u ovom lepom Kalvu, ne bi bilo potrebe da o njemu pi\u0161em. To mi nije bilo su\u0111eno. Ali kada sada (kao \u0161to se do rata de\u0161avalo jednom u nekoliko godina) ponovo sedim \u010detvrt sata na ogradi mosta preko kojeg sam kao de\u010dak hiljadu puta zabacio udicu, duboko i sa \u010dudesnim uzbu\u0111enjem ose\u0107am koliko je za mene lepo i zna\u010dajno bilo to \u0161to sam do\u017eiveo: da sam jednom imao domovinu! da sam jednom u jednom malom mestu na Zemlji poznavao sve ku\u0107e i njihove prozore i sve ljude iza njih!Da sam drvo, jo\u0161 uvek bih bio tamo. Ali ne mogu da \u017eelim da se ponovi ono \u0161to je bilo. Povremeno uradim to u svojim snovima i pesmama, ali u stvarnosti ne \u017eelim. s vremena na vreme provedem po koju no\u0107 u nostalgiji za Kalvom, Ali da \u017eivim tamo, svakoga sata, danju i no\u0107u, imao bih nostalgiju za lepim, starim vremenima koja su bila pre trideset godina i koja su davno protekla ispod luka starog mosta. To ne bi bilo dobro. Za postupcima koji su u\u010dinjeni i za smrtima koje su se desile, ne treba \u017ealiti.Samo ponekad treba da se tamo baci pogled, da se pro\u0161vrlja kroz ulicu Leder, da se \u010detvrt sata stoji na mostu, pa makar to bilo samo u snu, pa makar i ne tako \u010desto. Herman Hese, Umetnost Dokolice (deo Domovina, 1918)\u201d","That fear, that terrible and petrifying fear, which he felt while he was rolling the dice, while he was worried about losing high stakes, that fear he loved and sought to always renew it, always increase it, always get it to a slightly higher level, for in this feeling alone he still felt something like happiness, something like an intoxication, something like an elevated form of life in the midst of his saturated, lukewarm, dull life.","Siddhartha; Aquel que alcanzo sus objetivos","I can think, I can wait, I can fast.","When someone seeks, Siddhartha said, \u201cit is all too easy for his eyes to see nothing but the thing he seeks, so that he is unable to find anything or absorb anything because he is always thinking exclusively about what he seeks, because he has a goal, because he is obsessed by that goal. Seeking means having a goal. But finding means being free, remaining accessible, having no goal. You, venerable one, are perhaps really one who seeks, because, pressing after your goal, you fail to see many a thing that is right before your eyes.\u201d","When, one day, Kamaswami held against him that he had learned everything he knew from him, he replied: \u201cWould you please not kid me with such jokes! What I\u2019ve learned from you is how much a basket of fish costs and how much interests may be charged on loaned money. These are your areas of expertise. I haven\u2019t learned to think from you, my dear Kamaswami, you ought to be the one seeking to learn from me. Indeed his soul was not with the trade. The business was good enough to provide him with the money for Kamala, and it earned him much more than he needed. Besides this, Siddhartha\u2019s interest and curiosity was only concerned with the people, whose businesses, crafts, worries, pleasures, and acts of foolishness used to be as alien and distant to him as the moon. However easily he succeeded in talking to all of them, in living with all of them, in learning from all of them, he was still aware that there was something which separated him from them and this separating factor was him being a Samana. He saw mankind going through life\u201d","Instead of narrowing your world and simplifying your soul, you will have to absorb more and more of the world and at last take all of it up in your painfully expanded soul, if you are ever to find peace.","A ono sto se u meni dogadja u retkim casovima radosti, sto je za mene slast, dozivljaj, ekstaza i uzvisenost, to svet voli i trazi mozda jedino u pesnickim delima, a u zivotu smatra ludoscu. I odista, ako je svet u pravu, ako su ta muzika po kafanama, te masovne zabave, ti amerikanizovani ljudi, zadovoljni tako sitnim stvarima, u pravu- onda sam ja kriv, onda sam lud, onda sam odista, kako sam sebe cesto nazivao, stepski vuk, zivotinja koja je zalutala u tudj i nerazumljiv svet, koja vise ne nalazi onu svoju postojbinu, vazduh i hranu.","How is that?

The Glass Bead Game is thus a mode of playing with the total contents and values of our culture; it plays with them as, say, in the great age of the arts a painter might have played with the colors on his palette. All the insights, noble thoughts, and works of art that the human race has produced in its creative eras, all that subsequent periods of scholarly study have reduced to concepts and converted into intellectual property on all this immense body of intellectual values the Glass Bead Game player plays like the organist on an organ. And this organ has attained an almost unimaginable perfection; its manuals and pedals range over the entire intellectual cosmos; its stops are almost beyond number. Theoretically this instrument is capable of reproducing in the Game the entire intellectual content of the universe.","Those who love nothing and hate nothing in the world, have no fetters.","Jie grumiasi taip, kaip kleptomanas grumiasi su savo yda.

He had drunk much wine and later after midnight he went to bed, tired and yet agitated, nearly in tears and in despair. In vain did he try to sleep. His heart was so full of misery, he felt he could no longer endure it. He was full of nausea which overpowered him like a distasteful wine, or music that was too sweet and superficial, or like the too sweet smile of the dancers or the too sweet perfume of their hair and breasts. But above all he was nauseated with himself, with his perfumed hair, with the smell of the wine from his mouth, with the soft, flabby appearance of his skin.","You must not give way to desires which you don\'t believe in. I know what you desire. You should, however, either be capable of renouncing these desires or feel wholly justified in having them. Once you are able to make your request in such a way that you will be quite certain of its fulfillment, then the fulfillment will come. But at present you alternate between desire and renunciation and are afraid all the time. All that must be overcome.","In dieser Stunde h\xf6rte Siddhartha auf, mit dem Schicksal zu k\xe4mpfen, h\xf6rte auf zu leiden.

Throughout its history the Game was closely allied with music, and usually proceeded according to musical or mathematical rules. One theme, two themes, or three themes were stated, elaborated, varied, and underwent a development quite similar to that of the theme in a Bach fugue or a concerto movement. A Game, for example, might start from a given astronomical configuration, or from the actual theme of a Bach fugue, or from a sentence out of Leibniz or the Upanishads, and from this theme, depending on the intentions and talents of the player, it could either further explore and elaborate the initial motif or else enrich its expressiveness by allusions to kindred concepts. Beginners learned how to establish parallels, by means of the Game\u2019s symbols, between a piece of classical music and the formula for some law of nature. Experts and Masters of the Game freely wove the initial theme into unlimited combinations.","in order to learn how to love the world, in order to stop comparing it to some world I wished, I imagined, some kind of perfection I had made up, but to leave it as it is and to love it and to enjoy being a part of it.","La vida de todo hombre es un camino hacia s\xed mismo, la tentativa de un camino, la huella de un sendero.
