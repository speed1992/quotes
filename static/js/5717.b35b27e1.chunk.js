It is chosen and foreordained and he only holds the key to his own secret.","Trust thyself: every heart vibrates to that iron string.","These are the voices which we hear in solitude, but they grow faint and inaudible as we enter into the world.","The eloquent man is he who is no beautiful speaker, but who is inwardly and desperately drunk with a certain belief.","Good thoughts are no better than good dreams if you don\'t follow through.","He is great who is what he is from nature, and who never reminds us of others.","You have a place to live in this world which no other man can occupy; hence no competitors.","He is rich who owns the day, and no one owns the day who allows it to be invaded with fret and anxiety.","When good is near you, when you have life in yourself, it is not by any known or accustomed way; you shall not discern the foot-prints of any other; you shall not see the face of man; you shall not hear any name; the way, the thought, the good, shall be wholly strange and new. It shall exclude example and experience.","All is a riddle, and the key to a riddle...is another riddle.","Doing well is the result of doing good. That\'s what capitalism is all about.","The antidote to this abuse of formal Government, is, the influence of private character, the growth of the Individual.","What we call results are beginnings.","The ancestor of every action is a thought.","When nature has work to be done, she creates a genius to do it.","Every man is as lazy as he dares to be.","Every great man is unique.","You will always find those who think they know what is your duty better than you know it.","Skill to do comes of doing.","You think that your silence on certain topics, perhaps in the face of injustice, or unkindness, or mean-spiritedness, causes others to reserve judgement of you. Far otherwise; your silence utters very loud: you have no oracle to speak, no wisdom to offer, and your fellow men have learned that you cannot help them. Doth not wisdom cry, and understanding put forth her voice? We would be well to do likewise.","Poetry must be as new as foam and as old as the rock.","We dare not trust our wit for making our house pleasant to our friend, so we buy ice cream.","To the poet, to the philosopher, to the saint, all things are friendly and sacred, all events profitable, all days holy, all men divine.","Thou art to me a delicious torment.","The need for a rational consistency is the hobgoblin of small minds.","Nothing great ever happened without enthusiasm.","There is guidance for each of us, and by lowly listening we shall hear the right word.","Knowledge is the antidote to fear,-\\nKnowledge, Use and Reason, with its higher aids.","It is easy in the world to live after the world\'s opinion; it is easy in solitude to live after our own; but the great man is he who in the midst of the crowd keeps with perfect sweetness the independence of solitude.","Everything intercepts us from ourselves.","Some people are born very far from home.","Thought is the seed of action.","Bare lists of words are found suggestive to an imaginative and excited mind.","We find delight in the beauty and happiness of children that makes the heart too big for the body.","A hero is no braver than an ordinary man, but he is brave five minutes longer.","There are no fixtures in nature. The universe is fluid and volatile. Permanence is but a word of degrees.","I wish that life should not be cheap, but sacred.  I wish the days to be as centuries, loaded, fragrant.","If eyes were made for seeing, then beauty is its own excuse for being.","The universal soul is the alone creator of the useful and the beautiful; therefore to make anything useful or beautiful, the individual must be submitted to the universal mind.","Every spirit builds itself a house; and beyond its house, a world; and beyond its world a heaven. Know then, that the world exists for you: build, therefore, your own world.","Nature arms each man with some faculty which enables him to do easily some feat impossible to any other.","Every time you wink the stars move.","The best lightning rod for your protection is your own spine.","Fear is a great instructor.","Sorrow makes us all children again.","Tobacco, coffee, alcohol, hashish, prussic acid, strychnine, are weak dilutions; the surest poison is time. This cup which nature puts to our lips, has a wonderful virtue, surpassing that of any other draught. It opens the senses, adds power, fills us with exalted dreams, which we call hope, love, ambition, science; especially it creates a craving for larger draughts of itself.","The highest proof of civility is that the whole public action of the State is directed on securing the greatest good of the greatest number.","But dare rather to quit the platform, plunge into the sublime seas, dive deep, & swim far, so shall you come back with self-respect, with new power, with an advanced experience, that shall explain & overlook the old. Trust your emotion.","Now that is the wisdom of a man, in every instance of his labor, to hitch his wagon to a star, and see his chore done by the gods themselves. That is the way we are strong, by borrowing the might of the elements. The forces of steam, gravity, galvanism, light, magnets, wind, fire, serve us day by day and cost us nothing.","God enters by a private door into every individual.","Health is the condition of wisdom, and the sign is cheerfulness, - an open and noble temper.","There was never a child so lovely but his mother was glad to get him to sleep.","Let us be silent \u2014 so we may hear the whisper of the gods.","Grow angry slowly - there\'s plenty of time.","Let not a man guard his dignity, but let his dignity guard him.","It is a fact often observed, that men have written good verses under the inspiration of passion, who cannot write well under other circumstances.","The mob is man voluntarily descending to the nature of the beast. Its fit hour of activity is night. Its actions are insane like its whole constitution. It persecutes a principle; it would whip a right; it would tar and feather justice, by inflicting fire and outrage upon the houses and persons of those who have these. It resembles the prank of boys, who run with fire-engines to put out the ruddy aurora streaming to the stars.","there is no planet, sun, or star could hold you if you but knew what you are.","A sect or party is an elegant incognito devised to save a man from the vexation of thinking.","My giant goes with me wherever I go.","The wonder is that we can see these trees and not wonder more.","Character is that which can do without success.","Some eyes threaten like a loaded and levelled pistol, and others are as insulting as hissing or kicking; some have no more expression than blueberries, while others are as deep as a well which you can fall into.","Nature is an endless combination and repetition of a very few laws. She hums the old well-known air through innumerable variations.","All life is an experiment.","Do not be too timid and squeamish about your actions.","The best effort of a fine person is felt after we have left their presence.","Every man is a consumer, and ought to be a producer. He is by constitution expensive, and needs to be rich.","We live in succession, in division, in parts, in particles. Meantime within man is the soul of the whole; the wise silence; the universal beauty, to which every part and particle is equally related, the eternal ONE. And this deep power in which we exist and whose beatitude is all accessible to us, is not only self-sufficing and perfect in every hour, but the act of seeing and the thing seen, the seer and the spectacle, the subject and the object, are one. We see the world piece by piece, as the sun, the moon, the animal, the tree; but the whole, of which these are shining parts, is the soul.","The Gods we worship write their names on our faces; be sure of that. And a man will worship something ... That which dominates will determine his life and character. Therefore it behooves us to be careful what we worship, for what we are worshipping we are becoming.","Manners require time, and nothing is more vulgar than haste.","The age of a woman doesn\'t mean a thing. The best tunes are played on the oldest fiddles.","Knowledge is the only elegance.","A beautiful woman is a practical poet, taming her savage mate, planting tenderness, hope and eloquence in all whom she approaches.","Almost every man we meet requires some civility; requires to be humored; - he has some fame, some talent, some whim of religion or philanthropy in his head that is not to be questioned, and which spoils all conversation with him. But a friend is a sane man who exercises not my ingenuity, but me.","My evening visitors, if they cannot see the clock should find the time in my face.","Common sense is as rare as genius.","When a thought of Plato becomes a thought to me,--when a truth that fired the soul of Pindar fires mine, time is no more. When I feel that we two meet in a perception, that our two souls are tinged with the same hue, and do as it were run into one, why should I measure degrees of latitude, why should I count Egyptian years?","Commerce is a game of skill which everyone cannot play and few can play well.","Difficulties exist to be surmounted.","A man is what he thinks about all day long.","The force of character is cumulative.","What is life but the angle of vision? A man is measured by the angle at which he looks at objects. What is life but what a man is thinking of all day? This is his fate and his employer. Knowing is the measure of the man. By how much we know, so we are.","Desire is possibility seeking expression.","No one can cheat you out of ultimate success but yourself.","I hate this shallow Americanism which hopes to get rich by credit, to get knowledge by raps on midnight tables, to learn the economy of the mind by phrenology, or skill without study, or mastery without apprenticeship.","Every particular in nature, a leaf, a drop, a crystal, a moment of time is related to the whole, and partakes of the perfection of the whole.","We live by our imagination, our admirations, and our sentiments.","It is rare to find a man who believes in his own thoughts or speaks that which he is created to say. As nothing astonishes men so much as common sense and plain dealing, so nothing is more rare in any man than an act of his own...feel yourself, and be not daunted by things...The light by which we see this world comes out from the soul of the observer.","Whoso would be a man must be a nonconformist.","There is a certain satisfaction in coming down to the lowest ground of politics, for we get rid of cant and hypocrisy.","When the eyes say one thing, and the tongue another, a practiced man relies on the language of the first.","Art is a jealous mistress; and if a man have a genius for painting, poetry, music, architecture or philosophy, he makes a bad husband and an ill provider.","No law can be sacred to me but that of my nature. Good and bad are but names very readily transferable to that or this; the only right is what is after my constitution; the only wrong is what is against it.","We must be very suspicious of the deceptions of the element of time. It takes a good deal of time to eat or to sleep, or to earn ahundred dollars, and a very little time to entertain a hope and an insight which becomes the light of our life.","Use what language you will, you can never say anything but what you are.","There is always a best way of doing everything.","The universe is represented in every one of it\'s particles.  Everything is made of one hidden stuff.  The world globes itself in a drop of dew.  The true doctrine of omnipresence is that God appears with all His parts in every moss and cobweb.","Life wastes itself whilst we are preparing to live.","Traveling is a fool\'s paradise. Our first journeys discover to us the indifference of places. At home I dream that at Naples, at Rome, I can be intoxicated with beauty, and lose my sadness. I pack my trunk, embrace my friends, embark on the sea, and at last wake up in Naples, and there beside me is the stern fact, the sad self, unrelenting, identical, that I fled from. I seek the Vatican, and the palaces. I affect to be intoxicated with sights and suggestions, but I am not intoxicated. My giant goes with me wherever I go.","Language is a city to the building of which every human being brought a stone.","Nature never rhymes her children, nor makes two men alike. When we see a great man, we fancy a resemblance to some historical person, and predict the sequel of his character and fortune, a result which he is sure to disappoint. None will ever solve the problem of his character according to our prejudice, but only in his high unprecedented way.","To the attentive eye, each moment of the year has its own beauty, and in the same fields, it beholds, every hour, a picture which was never seen before, and which shall never be seen again.","Ne te quaesiveris extra.\\" (Do not seek for things outside of yourself)","Insist on yourself; never imitate. Your own gift you can offer with the cumulative force of a whole life\'s cultivation, but of the adopted talent of another, you have only an extemporaneous, half possession.","Insist on yourself. Never imitate.","Health is the first muse, and sleep is the condition to produce it.","Some thoughts always find us young, and keep us so. Such a thought is the love of the universal and eternal beauty.","The betrothed and accepted lover has lost the wildest charms of his maiden by her acceptance. She was heaven while he pursued her, but she cannot be heaven if she stoops to one such as he!","A man is usually more careful of his money than he is of his principles.","The true doctrine of omnipresence is, that God reappears with all his parts in every moss and cobweb.","The world is all gates, all opportunities, strings of tension waiting to be struck.","Welcome back my friends to the show that never ends. We\'re so glad you could attend, come inside, come inside.","I have only one doctrine, the infinitude of the private man.","A man is known by the books he reads, by the company he keeps, by the praise he gives, by his dress, by his tastes, by his distastes, by the stories he tells, by his gait, by the notion of his eye, by the look of his house, of his chamber; for nothing on earth is solitary but every thing hath affinities infinite.","I cannot go to the houses of my nearest relatives, because I do not wish to be alone. Society exists by chemical affinity, and not otherwise.","The civility of no race can be perfect whilst another race is degraded.","It all begins when the soul would have its way with you.","I have thought a sufficient measure of civilization is the influence of good women.","There is an optical illusion about every person we meet.","Trust your instinct to the end, though you can render no reason.","For each new morning with its light, For rest and shelter of the night, For health and food, for love and friends, For everything Thy goodness sends.","Obedience alone gives the right to command.","The line of beauty is the line of perfect economy.","Death comes to all, but great achievements build a monument which shall endure until the sun grows cold.","The cure for false theology is motherwit. Forget your books and traditions, and obey your moral perceptions at this hour.","The world belongs to the energetic.","When some external event raises your spirits and you think good days are preparing for you, do not believe it. It can never be so. Nothing can bring you peace but yourself.","As the gardener, by severe pruning, forces the sap of the tree into one or two vigorous limbs, so should you stop off your miscellaneous activity and concentrate your force on one or a few points.","Nothing is beneath you if it is in the direction of your life.","Society is infected with rude, cynical, restless, and frivolous persons who prey upon the rest, and whom no public opinion concentrated into good manners, forms accepted by the sense of all, can reach; the contradictors and railers at public and private tables, who are like terriers, who conceive it the duty of a dog of honor to growl at any passer-by, and do the honors of the house by barking him out of sight.","Let not the tie be mercenary, though the service is measured in money. Make yourself necessary to somebody. Do not make life hard to any.","If you love and serve man, you cannot, by any hiding or stratagem, escape remuneration.","To fill the hour\u2500\u2500that is happiness.","Where dwells the religion? Tell me first where dwells electricity, or motion, or thought or gesture. They do not dwell or stay atall. Electricity cannot be made fast, mortared up and ended, like London Monument, or the Tower, so that you shall know where to find it, and keep it fixed, as the English do with their things, forevermore; it is passing, glancing, gesticular; it is a traveller, a newness, a surprise, a secret which perplexes them, and puts them out.","Do the thing and you will have the power.","Genius always finds itself a century too early.","Love is like wildflowers; \\n It\'s often found in the most unlikely places.","Nature has made up her mind that what cannot defend itself shall not be defended.","Wealth is in applications of mind to nature; and the art of getting rich consists not in industry, much less in saving, but in a better order, in timeliness, in being at the right spot.","There is a time when a man distinguishes the idea of felicity from the idea of wealth; it is the beginning of wisdom.","Do not you see that every misfortune is misconduct; that every honour is desert; that every effort is an insolence of your own?...You carry your fortune in your own hand.","The sensual man conforms thoughts to things;\\nthe poet conforms things to his thoughts.","There is simply the rose; it is perfect in every moment of its existence.","People say law but they mean wealth.","Be not the slave of your own past - plunge into the sublime seas, dive deep, and swim far.","How much of human life is lost in waiting.","I cannot remember the books I\'ve read any more than the meals I have eaten; even so, they have made me.","Genius seems to consistent merely in trueness of sight.","Men wish to be saved from the mischiefs of their vices, but not from their vices.","For all men live by truth, and stand in need of expression. In love, in art, in avarice, in politics, in labor, in games, we study to utter our painful secret. The man is only half himself, the other half is his expression.","Improve your spare moments and they will become the brightest gems in your life.","Do not tell me of my obligation to put all poor men in good situations. Are they my poor? I tell thee, thou foolish philanthropist, that I grudge the dollar, the dime, the cent, I give to such men as do not belong to me and to whom I do not belong","The sum of wisdom is that time is never lost that is devoted to work.","What is a weed? A plant whose virtues have never been discovered.","The only prudence in life is concentration.","Nature: She pardons no mistakes. Her yea is yea, and her nay, nay.","There is one mind common to all individual men. Every man is an inlet to the same and to all of the same. He that is once admitted to the right of reason is made a freeman of the whole estate. What Plato has thought, he may think; what a saint has felt, he may feel; what at any time has befallen any man, he can understand. Who hath access to this universal mind is a party to all that is or can be done, for this is the only and sovereign agent","When a man lives with God, his voice shall be as sweet as the murmur of the brook and rustle of the corn.","There is no beautifier of complexion, or form, or behavior, like the wish to scatter joy and not pain around us.","It happens to us once or twice in a lifetime to be drunk with some book which probably has some extraordinary relative power to intoxicate us and none other; and having exhausted that cup of enchantment we go groping in libraries all our years afterwards in the hope of being in Paradise again.","Religion is to do right. It is to love, it is to serve, it is to think, it is to be humble.","Our knowledge is the amassed thought and experience of innumerable minds.","There are some men above grief and some men below it.","We have more than we use.","The finest and noblest ground on which people can live is truth; the real with the real; a ground on which nothing is assumed.","Every body we know surrounds himself with a fine house, fine books, conservatory, gardens, equipage, and all manner of toys, as screens to interpose between himself and his guest. Does it not seem as if man was of a very sly, elusive nature, and dreaded nothing so much as a full rencontre front to front with his fellow?","The cheapness of man is every day\'s tragedy.","For flowers that bloom about our feet; For tender grass, so fresh, so sweet; For song of bird, and hum of bee; For all things fair we hear or see, Father in heaven, we thank Thee!","The highest compact we can make with our fellow is -\\n\\"Let there be truth between us two forevermore.\\"","There is an intimate interdependence of intellect and morals.","Genius is saying what is in your heart, because it\'s in everyone\'s heart.","There is always safety in valor.","When there is no vision, people perish.","Language is fossil Poetry.","My life is not an apology, but a life.","Pretension may sit still, but cannot act. Pretension never feigned an act of real greatness. Pretension never wrote an Iliad, nordrove back Xerxes, nor christianized the world, nor abolished slavery.","The book of nature is the book of fate.  She turns the gigantic pages, leaf after leaf never returning one.","The foundations of a person are not in matter but in spirit.","The man for whom the law exists - the man of forms, the conservative - is a tame man.","Society everywhere is in conspiracy against the manhood of every one of its members.  The virtue in most request is conformity.  Self-reliance is its aversion.  It loves not realities and creators, but names and customs.","There can be no high civility without a deep morality, though it may not always call itself by that name.","If a man will kick a fact out of the window, when he comes back he finds it again in the chimney corner.","Truth is beautiful, without doubt; but so are lies.","That man is idle who can do something better.","Perception is a mirror not a fact. And what I look on is my state of mind, reflected outward.","Riding a horse is not a gentle hobby, to be picked up and laid down like a game of solitaire. It is a grand passion. It seizes a person whole and once it has done so, he/she will have to accept that his life will be radically changed.","What I must do is all that concerns me, not what the people think. This rule, equally arduous in actual and in intellectual life, may serve for the whole distinction between greatness and meanness.","Life is a festival only to the wise.","Every mind must know the whole lesson for itself,-must go over the whole ground. What it does not see, what it does not live, it will not know.","A friend may well be reckoned the masterpiece of nature.","Do not believe that possibly you can escape the reward of your action.","There was never anything that did not proceed from a thought.","If you would lift me up, you\'ve got to be on higher ground.","When all shoot at one mark, the gods join in the combat.","For everything you have missed, you have gained something else, and for everything you gain, you lose something else.","We do not count a man\'s years until he has nothing else to count.","The end of the human race will be that it will eventually die of civilization.","Cause and effect are two sides of one fact.","Valor consists in the power of self recovery.","Explore, and explore, and explore. Be neither chided nor flattered out of your position of perpetual inquiry. Neither dogmatise yourself, nor accept another\'s dogmatism. Why should you renounce your right to traverse the star-lit deserts of truth, for the premature comforts of an acre, house, and barn? Truth also has its roof, and bed, and board. Make yourself necessary to the world, and mankind will give you bread, and if not store of it, yet such as shall not take away your property in all men\'s possessions, in all men\'s affections, in art, in nature, and in hope.","What can we see, read, acquire, but ourselves. Take the book, my friend, and read your eyes out, you will never find there what I find.","Heroism works in contradiction to the voice of mankind and in contradiction, for a time, to the voice of the great and good. Heroism is an obedience to a secret impulse of an individual","All men are in some degree impressed by the face of the world; some men even to delight. This love of beauty is taste. Others have the same love in such success that, not content with admiring, they seek to embody it in new forms. The creation of beauty is art.","Napoleon said of Massena, that he was not himself until the battle began to go against him; then, when the dead began to fall in ranks around him, awoke his powers of combination, and he put on terror and victory as a robe.","Happy is the hearing man; unhappy the speaking man.","To be a man is to be a nonconformist.","The greater speed and success that distinguish the planting of the human race in this country, over all other plantations in history, owe themselves mainly to the new subdivisions of the State into small corporations of land and power.","Speak the affirmative; emphasize your choice by utter ignoring of all that you reject.","I pack my trunk, embrace my friends, embark on the sea and at last wake up in Naples, and there beside me is the stern fact, the sad self, unrelenting, identical, that I fled from.","As long as our civilization is essentially one of property, of fences, of exclusiveness, it will be mocked by delusions.","There is a mortifying experience in particular, which does not fail to wreak itself also in the general history; I mean \\"the foolish face of praise,\\" the forced smile which we put on in company where we do not feel at ease, in answer to conversation which does not interest us. The muscles, not spontaneously moved but moved, by a low usurping wilfulness, grow tight about the outline of the face, with the most disagreeable sensation.","I am old, yet I look at wise men and see that I am very young. I look over those stars yonder, and into the myriads of the aspirant and ordered souls, and see I am a stranger and a youth and have yet my spurs to win. Too ridiculous are these airs of age.","Progress is the activity of today and the assurance of tomorrow","The louder he talked of his honor, the faster we counted our spoons.","We read often with as much talent as we write.","The eyes indicate the antiquity of the soul.","Fate is unpenetrated causes.","These are the voices which we hear in solitude, but they grow faint and inaudible as we enter into the world. Society everywhere is in conspiracy against the manhood of everyone of its members. Society is a joint-stock company, in which the members agree, for the better securing of his bread to each shareholder, to surrender the liberty and culture of the eater. The virtue in most request is conformity. Self-reliance is its aversion. It loves not realities and creators, but names and customs.","Everything in nature is bipolar, or has a positive and a negative pole.","No facts are to me sacred; none are profane; I simply experiment, an endless seeker, with no past at my back.","The man, who has seen the rising moon break out of the clouds at midnight, has been present like an archangel at the creation of light and of the world.","I read your piece on Plato. Holmes, when you strike at a king, you must kill him.","Flowers... are a proud assertion that a ray of beauty outvalues all the utilities of the world.","The way to write is to throw your body at the mark when your arrows are spent.","A man is a method, a progressive arrangement; a selecting principle, gathering his like to him; wherever he goes.","Character teaches above our wills.","Men seek to be great; they would have offices, wealth, power, and fame. They think that to be great is to possess one side of nature,--the sweet, without the other side,--the bitter.","Each is liable to panic, which is exactly, the terror of ignorance surrendered to the imagination. Knowledge is the encourager, knowledge that takes fear out of the heart, knowledge and use, which is knowledge in practice. They can conquer who believe they can. It is he who has done the deed once who does not shrink from attempting again.","Action is with the scholar subordinate, but it is essential. Without it, he is not yet man. Without it, thought can never ripen into truth.","Man is a stream whose source is hidden. Our being is descending into us from we know not whence. The most exact calculator has noprescience that somewhat incalculable may not balk the very next moment. I am constrained every moment to acknowledge a higher origin for events than the will I call mine.","The Roman rule was, to teach a boy nothing that he could not learn standing. The old English rule was, \\"All summer in the field, and all winter in the study.\\" And it seems as if a man should learn to plant, or to fish, or to hunt, that he might secure his subsistence at all events, and not be painful to his friends and fellow men.","The greatest discoveries are those that shed light unto ourselves.","Man was born to be rich, or to inevitably grow rich, by the use of his faculties: by the union of thought with nature.","If a man can write a better book, preach a better sermon, or make a better mousetrap than his neighbor, though he build his house in the woods, the world will make a beaten path to his door.","A man must thank his defects, and stand in some terror of his talents.","Men are respectable only as they respect.","Our admiration of the antique is not admiration of the old, but of the natural.","We do not yet possess ourselves, and we know at the same time that we are much more.","Convert life into truth.","Sometimes a scream is better than a thesis.","Every revolution was first a thought in one man\'s mind; and when the same thought occurs to another man, it is the key to that era.","It is in rugged crises, in unbearable endurance, and in aims which put sympathy out of the question, that the angel is shown.","And yet--it is not beauty that inspires the deepest passion. Beauty without grace is the hook without the bait. Beauty, without expression, tires.","Men talk as if victory were something fortunate. Work is victory.","Hitch your wagon to a star.","There is nothing capricious in nature and the implanting of a desire indicates that its gratification is in the constitution of the creature that feel it.","Every violation of truth is not only a sort of suicide in the liar, but is a stab at the health of human society.","Our housekeeping is mendicant, our arts, our occupations, our marriages, our religion we have not chosen but society has chosen for us.","Men in all ways are better than they seem.","There is a time in every man\'s education when he arrives at the conviction that envy is ignorance; that imitation is suicide.","A rush of thoughts is the only conceivable prosperity that can come to us.","The sun shines and warms and lights us and we have no curiosity to know why this is so; but we ask the reason of all evil, of pain, and hunger, and mosquitoes and silly people.","Those who stay away from the election think that one vote will do no good. \'Tis but one step more to think one vote will do no harm.","Every mind must make its choice between truth and repose. It cannot have both.","Men\'s actions are too strong for them. Show me a man who has acted, and who has not been the victim and slave of his action.","A determined man, by his very attitude and the tone of his voice, puts a stop to defeat, and begins to conquer.","A man is a little thing whilst he works by and for himself, but, when he gives voice to the rules of love and justice, is godlike, his word is current in all countries; and all men, though his enemies, are made his friends and obey it as their own.","In every man there is something wherein I may learn of him, and in that I am his pupil.","There is a third silent party to all our bargains. The nature and soul of things takes on itself the guaranty of the fulfillment of every contract, so that honest service cannot come to loss. If you serve an ungrateful master, serve him the more. Put God in your debt. Every stroke shall be repaid. The longer the payment is withholden, the better for you; for compound interest on compound interest is the rate and usage of this exchequer.","A foolish consistency is the hobgoblin of little minds, adored by little statesmen and philosophers and divines.","Concentration is the secret of strength in politics, in war, in trade, in short in all management of human affairs.","I am the lover of uncontained and immortal beauty. In the wilderness, I find something more dear and connate than in streets or villages. In the tranquil landscape, and especially in the distant line of the horizon, man beholds somewhat as beautiful as his own nature.","For nonconformity the world will whip you with its displeasure.","Wherever snow falls, or water flows, or birds fly, wherever day and night meet in twilight, wherever the blue heaven is hung by clouds, or sown with stars, wherever are forms with transparent boundaries, wherever are outlets into celestial space, wherever is danger, and awe, and love, there is Beauty, plenteous as rain, shed for thee, and though thou shouldest walk the world over, thou shalt not be able to find a condition inopportune or ignoble.","Eyes are bold as lions,--roving, running, leaping, here and there, far and near. They speak all languages. They wait for no introduction; they are no Englishmen; ask no leave of age or rank; they respect neither property nor riches, neither learning nor power, nor virtue, nor sex, but intrude, and come again, and go through and through you in a moment of time. What inundation of life and thought is discharged from one soul into another through them!","Live in the fields, and God will give you lectures on natural philosophy every day.","Activity is contagious.","When he is pushed, tormented, defeated, he has a chance to learn something; ... he learns his ignorance, is cured of the insanity of conceit; has got moderation and real skill.","...most men have bound their eyes with one or another handkerchief, and attached themselves to some one of these communities of opinion. This conformity makes them not false in a few particulars, authors of a few lies, but false in all particulars. Their every truth is not quite true. Their two is not the real two, their four not the real four; so that every word they say chagrins us, and we know not where to begin to set them right.","Life is not so short but that there is always time enough for courtesy.","Cause and effect, means and ends, seed and fruit cannot be severed; for the effect already blooms in the cause, the end preexists in the means, the fruit in the seed","When he is pushed, tormented, defeated, he has a chance to learn something; he has been put on his wits, on his manhood; he has gained facts; learns his ignorance; is cured of the insanity of conceit; has got moderation and real skill.","The two parties which divide the state, the party of Conservation and that of Innovation, are very old, and have disputed the possession of the world ever since it was made.","A skilful man reads his dreams for his selfknowledge; yet not the details, but the quality.","Do not say things. What you are stands over you the while, and thunders, so that I cannot hear what you say to the contrary.","All are needed by each one; Nothing is fair or good alone.","Is not marriage an open question, when it is alleged, from the beginning of the world, that such as are in the institution wish to get out, and such as are out wish to get in?","A man must consider what a rich realm he abdicates when he becomes a conformist.","Every man supposes himself not to be fully understood or appreciated.","A good indignation brings out all one\'s powers.","The unique impression of Jesus upon mankind - whose name is not so much written as ploughed into the history of the world - is proof of the subtle virtue of this infusion. Jesus belonged to the race of prophets. He saw with open eyes the mystery of the soul. One man was true to what is in you and me. He, as I think, is the only soul in history who has appreciated the worth of man.","The soul comes from without into the human body, as into a temporary abode, and it goes out of it anew it passes into other habitations, for the soul is immortal.\\" \\"It is the secret of the world that all things subsist and do not die, but only retire a little from sight and afterwards return again. Nothing is dead; men feign themselves dead, and endure mock funerals... and there they stand looking out of the window, sound and well, in some strange new disguise.","In every society some men are born to rule, and some to advise.","If you believe in the soul, do not clutch at sensual sweetness before it is ripe on the slow tree of cause and effect.","Great hearts steadily send forth the secret forces that incessantly draw great events.","The best of life is conversation, and the greatest success is confidence, or perfect understanding between sincere people.","We live amid surfaces, and the true art of life is to skate well on them","Respect the child.  Wait and see the new product of Nature.  Nature loves analogies, but not repetitions.  Respect the child.  Be not too much his parent.  Trespass not on his solitude.","Things have their laws as well as men, and things refuse to be trifled with.","The men who carry their points do not need to inquire of their constituents what they should say, but are themselves the country which they represent: nowhere are its emotions or opinions so instant and so true as in them; nowhere so pure from a selfish infusion.","Fractures well cured make us more strong.","Build a better mousetrap and the world will beat a path to your door.","Manners are the happy ways of doing things; each once a stroke of genius or of love, now repeated and hardened into usage.","Life is March weather, savage and serene in one hour.","I see the spectacle of morning from the hilltop over against my house, from daybreak to sunrise, with emotions which an angel might share. The long slender bars of cloud float like fishes in the sea of crimson light. From the earth, as a shore, I look out into that silent sea. I seem to partake its rapid transformations; the active enchantment reaches my dust, and I dilate and conspire with the morning wind.","Wherever a man commits a crime, God finds a witness. Every secret crime has its reporter.","You have just dined, and however scrupulously the slaughterhouse is concealed in the graceful distance of miles, there is complicity.","How much we forgive to those who yield us the rare spectacle of heroic manners! We will pardon them the want of books, or arts, and even of gentler virtues. How tenaciously we remember them!","Tomorrow is a new day. You shall begin it well and serenely","We have feudal governments in a commercial age. It would be but an easy extension of our commercial system, to pay a private emperor a fee for services, as we pay an architect, an engineer, or a lawyer. If any man has talent for righting wrong, for administering difficult affairs, for counselling poor farmers how to turn their estates to good husbandry, for combining a hundred private enterprises to a general benefit, let him in the county- town, or in Court-street, put up his sign-board, Mr. Smith, Governor, Mr. Johnson, Working king.","The religion of one age is the literary entertainment of the next.","Tobacco, coffee, alcohol, hashish, prussic acid, strychnine, are weak dilutions. The surest poison is time.","He is only rich who owns the day. There is no king, rich man, fairy, or demon who possesses such power as that.","The reason why the world lacks unity, and lies broken and in heaps, is, because man is disunited with himself.","Any relation to the land, the habit of tilling it, or mining it, or even hunting on it, generates the feeling of patriotism. He who keeps shop on it, or he who merely uses it as a support to his desk and ledger, or to his manufactory, values it less.","Our fear of death is like our fear that summer will be short, but when we have had our swing of pleasure, our fill of fruit, and our swelter of heat, we say we have had our day.","There are moods in which we court suffering, in the hope that here, at least, we shall find reality, sharp peaks and edges of truth. But it turns out to be scene-painting and counterfeit. The only thing grief has taught me is to know how shallow it is.","In art, the hand can never execute anything higher than the heart can imagine.","The world exists for the education of each man.","Some of your griefs you have cured, And the sharpest you still have survived, But what torments of grief you\'ve endured From evils that never arrived.","There is a kind of latent omniscience, not only in every man, but in every particle.","You must elect your work; you shall take what your brains can, and drop all the rest. Only so can that amount of vital force accumulate which can make the step from knowing to doing. No matter how much faculty of idle seeing a man has, the step from knowing to doing is rarely taken. It is a step out of a chalk circle of imbecility into fruitfulness.","Our young people are diseased with the theological problems of original sin, origin of evil, predestination, and the like. These never presented a practical difficulty to any man,--never darkened across any man\'s road, who did not go out of his way to seek them. These are the soul\'s mumps, and measles, and whooping- coughs, and those who have not caught them cannot describe their health or prescribe a cure. A simple mind will not know these enemies.","An orator or author is never successful till he has learned to make his words smaller than his ideas.","A man in pursuit of greatness feels no little wants.","The mass of men worry themselves into nameless graves while here and there a great unselfish soul forgets himself into immortality.","Spring still makes spring in the mind\\nWhen sixty years are told:\\nLove wakes anew this throbbing heart,\\nAnd we are never old\\nOver the winter glaciers\\nI see the summer glow\\nAnd through the wind-piled snowdrift\\nThe warm rosebuds below.","We are shut up in school and college recitation rooms for ten to fifteen years, and come out at last with a bellyful of words and do not know a thing. We cannot use our hands, or our legs, or our eyes, or our arms. We do not know an edible root in the woods. We cannot tell our course by the stars, nor the hour of day by the sun. It is well if we can swim and skate. We are afraid of a horse or a cow, of a dog, of a cat, of a spider. Far better was the Roman rule to teach a boy nothing that he could not learn standing.","Wisdom is like electricity. There is no permanently wise man, but men capable of wisdom, who, being put into certain company, or other favorable conditions, become wise for a short time, as glasses rubbed acquire electric power for a while.","Standing on the bare ground,--my head bathed by the blithe air and uplifted into infinite space,--all mean egotism vanishes. I become a transparent eyeball; I am nothing; I see all; the currents of the Universal Being circulate through me; I am part or parcel of God.","We are of different opinions at different hours, but we always may be said to be at heart on the side of truth.","Sleep lingers all our lifetime about our eyes, as night hovers all day in the boughs of the fir-tree.","Let every man shovel out his own snow and the whole city will be passable.","I awoke this morning with devout thanksgiving for my friends, the old and the new.","The key to every man is his thought. Sturdy and defying though he look, he has a helm which he obeys, which is the idea after which all his facts are classified. He can only be reformed by showing him a new idea which commands his own.","The true test of civilization is not the census, nor the size of cities, nor the crops - no, but the kind of man the country turns out.","Every day brings a ship, Every ship brings a word; Well for those who have no fear, Looking seaward well assured That the word the vessel brings Is the word they wish to hear.","There are men too superior to be seen except by a few, as there are notes too high for the scale of most ears.","I think sometimes could I only have music on my own terms, could I live in a great city, and know where I could go whenever I wished the ablution and inundation of musical waves, that were a bath and a medicine.","The Jews believed Jerusalem to be the centre. I have seen a kratometric chart designed to show that the city of Philadelphia was in the same thermic belt, and, by inference, in the same belt of empire, as the cities of Athens, Rome, and London. It was drawn by a patriotic Philadelphian, and was examined with pleasure, under his showing, by the inhabitants of Chestnut Street. But, when carried to Charleston, to New Orleans, and to Boston, it somehow failed to convince the ingenious scholars of all those capitals.","The greatest meliorator of the world is selfish, huckstering Trade.","The preamble of thought, the transition through which it passes from the unconscious to the conscious, is action. Only so much do I know, as I have lived. Instantly we know whose words are loaded with life, and whose not.","Each man, if he attempts to join himself to others, is on all sides cramped and diminished of his proportion; and the stricter theunion, the smaller and the more pitiful he is. But leave him alone, to recognize in every hour and place the secret soul, he will go up and down doing the works of a true member, and, to the astonishment of all, the work will be done with concert, though no man spoke.","Truth is the summit of being; justice is the application of it to affairs.","We are thus assisted by natural objects in the expression of particular meanings. But how great a language to convey such pepper-corn informations!","Do the thing and you will have the power. But they that do not the thing, had not the power.","You never know how you look through other people\'s eyes.","So . . . I feel in regard to this aged England . . . pressed upon by transitions of trade and . . . competing populations,-I see her not dispirited, not weak, but well remembering that she has seen dark days before;-indeed, with a kind of instinct that she sees a little better in a cloudy day, and that, in storm of battle and calamity, she has a secret vigor and a pulse like a cannon.","Sculpture and painting have the effect of teaching us manners and abolishing hurry.","Our culture, therefore, must not omit the arming of the man. Let him hear in season, that he is born into the state of war, and that the commonwealth and his own well-being require that he should not go dancing in the weeds of peace, but warned, self- collected, and neither defying nor dreading the thunder, let him take both reputation and life in his hand, and, with perfect urbanity, dare the gibbet and the mob by the absolute truth of his speech, and the rectitude of his behaviour.","I please myself with the graces of the winter scenery, and believe that we are as much touched by it as by the genial influences of summer.","In youth, we clothe ourselves with rainbows, with hope & love, & go as brave as the zodiack. In age we put out another sort of perspiration; gout, fever, rheumatism, caprice, doubt, fretting, and avarice.","Let him be great, and love shall follow him. Nothing is more deeply punished than the neglect of the affinities by which alone society should be formed, and the insane levity of choosing associates by others eyes.","It is much better to learn the elements of geology, of botany, or ornithology and astronomy by word of mouth from a companion than dully from a book.","But harder still it has proved to resist and rule the dragon Money, with his paper wings. Chancellors and Boards of Trade, Pitt, Peel, and Bobinson, and their parliaments, and their whole generation, adopted false principles, and went to their graves in the belief that they were enriching the country which they were impoverishing.","By God, I will not obey this filthy enactment!","Unhappily, no man exists who has not in his own person become, to some amount, a stockholder in the sin, and so made himself liable to a share in the expiation.","Many times the reading of a book has made the future of a man.","If a man carefully examine his thoughts he will be surprised to find how much he lives in the future. His well-being is always ahead. Such a creature is probably immortal.","A self-denial, no less austere than the saint\'s, is demanded of the scholar. He must worship truth, and forgo all things for that,and choose defeat and pain, so that his treasure in thought is thereby augmented.","Every man\'s Reason is sufficient for his guidance, if used.","Man\'s life is a progress, not a station.","We are very near to greatness: one step and we are safe; can we not take the leap?","We sometimes observe that spoiled children contract a habit of annoying quite wantonly those who have charge of them, and seem tomeasure their own sense of well-being, not by what they do, but by the degree of reaction they can cause. It is vain to get rid of them by not minding them: if purring and humming is not noticed, they squeal and screech; then if you chide and console them, they find the experiment succeeds, and they begin again. The child will sit in your arms contented if you do nothing. If you take a book and read, he commences hostile operations.","When we see a soul whose acts are all regal, graceful, and pleasant as roses, we must thank God that such things can be and are.","The crime which bankrupts men and states is job-work-declining from your main design, to serve a turn here and there. Nothing is beneath you, if it is in the direction of your life, nothing is great or desirable if it is off from that. I think we are entitled here to draw a straight line and say that society can never prosper but must always be bankrupts, until every man does that which he was created to do.","There is always a best way of doing everything, if it be to boil an egg. Manners are the happy ways of doing things.","The thief steals from himself. The swindler swindles himself. For the real price is knowledge and virtue, whereof wealth and credit are signs. These signs, like paper money, may be counterfeited or stolen, but that which they represent, namely, knowledge and virtue, cannot be counterfeited or stolen.","No member of a crew is praised for the rugged individuality of his rowing.","Is not prayer a study of truth, a sally of the soul into the unfound infinite? No man ever prayed heartily without learning something.","A creative economy is the fuel of magnificence.","We live in a new and exceptional age. America is another word for Opportunity. Our whole history appears like a last effort of the Divine Providence in behalf of the human race; and a literal, slavish following of precedents, as by a justice of the peace, is not for those who at this hour lead the AMERICAN CIVILIZATION.","We take care of our health; we lay up money; we make our roof tight, and our clothing sufficient; but who provides wisely that he shall not be wanting in the best property of all, -friends?","In the matter of religion, people eagerly fasten their eyes on the difference between their own creed and yours; whilst the charm of the study is in finding the agreements and identities in all the religions of humanity.","Talent alone cannot make a writer. There must be a man behind the book.","Fame is proof that the people are gullible.","The less government we have the better.","Our distrust is very expensive.","The good lawyer is not the man who has an eye to every side and angle of contingency, and qualifies all his qualifications, but who throws himself on your part so heartily, that he can get you out of a scrape.","The first farmer was the first man, and all historic nobility rests on possession and use of land.","This valley is the only place that comes up to the brag about it, and exceeds it.","Every ship that comes to America got its chart from Columbus.","It is one soul which animates all men.","Nature never wears a mean appearance. Neither does the wisest man extort her secret, and lose his curiosity by finding out all her perfection.","Dreams have a poetic integrity and truth. This limbo and dust-hole of thought is presided over by a certain reason, too.","Our chief want is someone who will inspire us to be what we know we could be.","Every man is a quotation from all his ancestors.","America is another name for opportunity.","Each age, it is found, must write its own books; or rather, each generation for the next succeeding.","Even in the mud and scum of things, something always, always sings.","The landscape belongs to the person who looks at it...\\" -Ralph Waldo Emerson","You cannot do wrong without suffering wrong.","We are shut up in schools and college recitation rooms for ten or fifteen years, and come out at last with a bellyful of words and do not know a thing.","God made yeast, as well as dough, and loves fermentation just as dearly as he loves vegetation.","The measure of a master is his success in bringing all men around to his opinion twenty years later.","Yet America is a poem in our eyes; its ample geography dazzles the imagination, and it will not wait long for metres.","A painter told me that nobody could draw a tree without in some sort becoming a tree; or draw a child by studying the outlines of its form merely but by watching for a time his motions and plays, the painter enters into his nature and can then draw him at every attitude.","Painting was called silent poetry and poetry speaking painting.","Every man takes care that his neighbor shall not cheat him.  But a day comes when he begins to care that he does not cheat his neighbor.  Then all goes well.  He has changed his market cart into a chariot of the sun.","Spirit, that made those heroes dare\\nTo die, and leave their children free,\\nBid Time and Nature gently spare\\nThe shaft we raise to them and thee.","We do what we must, and call it by the best names.","The hues of the opal, the light of the diamond, are not to be seen if the eye is too near.","Art is the path of the creator to his work.","Speech is power: speech is to persuade, to convert, to compel. It is to bring another out of his bad sense into your good sense.","No matter how you seem to fatten on a crime, there can never be good for the bee which is bad for the hive.","No man should travel until he has learned the language of the country he visits. Otherwise he voluntarily makes himself a great baby - so helpless and so ridiculous.","Man Thinking must not be subdued by his instruments. Books are for the scholar\'s idle times. When he can read God directly, the hour is too precious to be wasted in other men\'s transcripts of their readings.","Half a man\'s wisdom goes with his courage.","Those who listened to Lord Chatham felt that there was something finer in the man, than anything which he said.","And what greater calamity can fall upon a nation than the loss of worship.","A little praise goes a great ways.","Do what we can, summer will have its flies.","All promise outruns performance.","Thoughts come into our minds by avenues which we never left open, and thoughts go out of our minds through avenues which we never voluntarily opened.","We fill the hands and nurseries of our children with all manner of dolls, drums and horses, withdrawing their eyes from the plain face and... Nature, the sun and moon, the animals, the water and stones, which should be their toys.","Nature paints the best part of a picture, carves the best parts of the statue, builds the best part of the house, and speaks the best part of the oration.","And truly it demands something god like in him who has cast off the common motives of humanity, and has ventured to trust himself for a taskmaster. High be his heart, faithful his will, clear his sight, that he may in good earnest be doctrine, society, law, to himself, that a simple purpose may be to him as strong as iron necessity is to others!","If you would not be known to do anything, never do it.","By the rude bridge that arched the flood, Their flag to April\'s breeze unfurled, Here once the embattled farmers stood, And fired the shot heard round the world.","Some men, at the approach of a dispute, neigh like horses.","No man can help another without helping himself.","No man acquires property without acquiring with it a little arithmetic also.","Nothing shall warp me from the belief that every man is a lover of truth. There is no pure lie, no pure malignity in nature. The entertainment of the proposition of depravity is the last profligacy and profanation. There is no skepticism, no atheism but that. Could it be received into common belief, suicide would unpeople the planet.","There are only ten minutes in the life of a pear when it is perfect to eat.","I will not hide my tastes or aversions. I will so trust that what is deep is holy, that I will do strongly before the sun and moon whatever only rejoices me, and the heart appoints","To be great is to be misunderstood.","Judge of your natural character by what you do in your dreams.","All my best thoughts were stolen by the ancients.","We mark with light in the memory the few interviews we have had with souls that made our souls wiser, that spoke what we thought, that told us what we knew, that gave us leave to be what we inly are.","Every man alone is sincere. At the entrance of a second person, hypocrisy begins","Intellect annuls fate. So far as a man thinks he is free.","When the man is at home, his standing in society is well known and quietly taken; but when he is abroad, it is problematical, and is dependent on the success of his manners.","Love and you shall be loved. All love is mathematically just, as much as two sides of an algebraic equation.","If the tongue had not been framed for articulation, man would still be a beast in the forest.","Can anything be so elegant as to have few wants, and to serve them one\'s self?","It is said that the world is in a state of bankruptcy, that the world owes the world more than the world can pay.","There is a blessed necessity by which the interest of men is always driving them to the right; and, again, making all crime mean and ugly.","There is one other reason for dressing well, namely that dogs respect it, and will not attack you in good clothes.","In a library we are surrounded by many hundreds of dear friends, but they are imprisoned by an enchanter in these paper and leathern boxes.","For, the sense of being which in calm hours rises, we know not how, in the soul, is not diverse from things, from space, from light, from time, from man, but one with them, and proceeds obviously from the same source whence their life and being also proceed. We first share the life by which things exist, and afterwards see them as appearances in nature, and forget that we have shared their cause. Here is the fountain of action and of thought.","That which we call sin in others is experiment for us.","A man is known by the books he reads.","When a resolute young fellow steps up to the great bully, the world, and takes him boldly by the beard, he is often surprised to find it comes off in his hand, and that it was only tied on to scare away the timid adventurers.","All my hurts my garden spade can heal.","Enthusiasm is the leaping lightning, not to be measured by the horse-power of the understanding","Every great and commanding movement in the annals of the world is due to the triumph of enthusiasm. Nothing great was ever achieved without it","The heroic soul does not sell its justice and its nobleness.","Every man is an impossibility until he is born.","The first point of courtesy must always be truth.","Sunshine cannot bleach the snow, Nor time unmake what poets know","The senses collect the surface facts of matter... It was sensation; when memory came, it was experience; when mind acted, it was knowledge; when mind acted on it as knowledge, it was thought.","Nothing is great but the inexhaustible wealth of nature.","When a whole nation is roaring patriotism at the top of its voice, I am fain to explore the cleanness of its hands and the purity of its heart.","There is more in every person\'s soul than we think.","By his machines man can dive and remain under water like a shark; can fly like a hawk in the air; can see atoms like a gnat; can see the system of the universe of Uriel, the angel of the sun; can carry whatever loads a ton of coal can lift; can knock down cities with his fist of gunpowder; can recover the history of his race by the medals which the deluge, and every creature, civil or savage or brute, has involuntarily dropped of its existence; and divine the future possibility of the planet and its inhabitants by his perception of laws of nature.","My angel,-his name is Freedom,-\\nChoose him to be your king;\\nHe shall cut pathways east and west,\\nAnd fend you with his wing.","The mark of the man of the world is absence of pretension. He does not make a speech; he takes a low business-tone, avoids all brag, is nobody, dresses plainly, promises not at all, performs much, speaks in monosyllables, hugs his fact.","We know more from nature than we can at will communicate.","The basis of good manners is self-reliance. Necessity is the law of all who are not self-possessed.","The great poet makes us feel our own wealth, and then we think less of his compositions. His best communication to our mind is to teach us to despise all he has done.","Oh, be my friend, and teach me to be thine!","The world proceeds from the same spirit as the body of man. It is a remoter and inferior incarnation of God, a projection of God in the unconscious.","We denote this primary wisdom as Intuition, whilst all later teachings are tuitions.","That which we do not call education is more precious than that which we call so.","True friends are two people who are comfortable sharing silence together.","We want but two or three friends, but these we cannot do without, and they serve us in every thought we think.","He then learns that in going down into the secrets of his own mind, he has descended into the secrets of all minds.","He who is in love is wise and is becoming wiser.","What is indispensable to inspiration? ...sound sleep and the provocation of a good book or a companion.","The first thing a great person does is make us realize the insignificance of circumstance.","There is always a certain meanness in the argument of conservatism, joined with a certain superiority in its fact.","The world-spirit is a good swimmer, and storms and waves can not drown him. He snaps his fingers at laws; and so, throughout history, heaven seems to affect low and poor means. Through the years and the centuries, through evil agents, through toys and atoms, a great and beneficent tendency irresistibly streams.","Scholarship is to be created not by compulsion, but by awakening a pure interest in knowledge.","A man often pays dear for a small frugality.","We are by nature observers, and thereby learners. That is our permanent state.","Life will show you masks that are worth all your carnivals","You\'ve got to be taught, to hate and fear,\\nYou\'ve got to be taught, from year to year,\\nIt\'s got to be drummed in your dear little ear,\\nYou\'ve got to be carefully taught.","Ability without honor has no value.","To map out a course of action and follow it to an end requires some of the same courage that a soldier needs.","Every reform was once a private opinion.","Life is a series of surprises and would not be worth taking or keeping if it were not.","An imaginative book renders us much more service at first, by stimulating us through its tropes, than afterward, when we arrive atthe precise sense of the author. I think nothing is of any value in books, excepting the transcendental and extraordinary.","God never jests with us, and will not compromise the end of nature, by permitting any inconsequence in its procession.","A garden is like those pernicious machineries which catch a man\'s coat-skirt or his hand, and draw in his arm, his leg , and his whole body to irresistible destruction.","Women, as most susceptible, are the best index of the coming hour.","Live in the sunshine.","But only that soul can be my friend which I encounter on the line of my own march, that soul to which I do not decline, and which does not decline me, but, native of the same celestial latitude, repeats in its own all my experience.","In a virtuous action, I properly am; in a virtuous act, I add to the world; I plant into deserts conquered from Chaos and Nothing, and see the darkness receding on the limits of the horizon.","Slavery is an institution for converting men into monkeys.","A man should carry nature in his head.","The foolish man wonders at the unusual, but the wise man at the usual.","Marriage is the perfection which love aimed at, ignorant of what it sought.","Nature and books belong to the eyes that see them. It depends on the mood of the man, whether he shall see the sunset or the fine poem. There are always sunsets, and there is always genius; but only a few hours so serene that we can relish nature or criticism. The more or less depends on structure or temperament. Temperament is the iron wire on which the beads are strung. Of what use is fortune or talent to a cold and defective store?","He only is a well-made man who has a good determination.","Truth is the summit of being.","Nature magically suits a man to his fortunes, by making them the fruit of his character.","Nature is not always tricked in holiday attire, but the same scene which yesterday breathed perfume and glittered as for the frolic of the nymphs, is overspread with melancholy today. Nature always wears the colors of the spirit.","Discontent is want of self-reliance; it is infirmity of will.","There never was a strong character that was not made strong by discipline of the will; there never was a strong people that did not rank subordination and discipline among the signal virtues. Subjection to moods is the mark of a deteriorating morality. There is no baser servitude than that of the man whose caprices are his masters, and a nation composed of such men could not long preserve its liberties.","One lesson we learn early, that in spite of seeming difference, men are all of one pattern. We readily assume this with our mates, and are disappointed and angry if we find that we are premature, and that their watches are slower than ours. In fact, the only sin which we never forgive in each other is difference of opinion.","I think we must get rid of slavery or we must get rid of freedom.","Only a biker knows why a dog sticks his head out of a car window.","Being perfectly well-dressed gives a feeling of tranquillity that religion is powerless to bestow.","Whoever is open, loyal, true; of humane and affable demeanour; honourable himself, and in his judgement of others; faithful to his word as to law, and faithful alike to God and man....such a man is a true gentleman.","To give money to a sufferer is only a come-off. It is only a postponement of the real payment, a bribe paid for silence, a creditsystem in which a paper promise to pay answers for the time instead of liquidation. We owe to man higher succors than food and fire. We owe to man.","Things are in the saddle. And ride mankind.","He in whom the love of repose predominates will accept the first creed, the first philosophy, the first political party he meets \u2014 most likely his father\'s. He gets rest, commodity, and reputation; but he shuts the door of truth.","When summer opens, I see how fast it matures, and fear it will be short; but after the heats of July and August, I am reconciled, like one who has had his swing, to the cool of autumn.","It is better to suffer injustice than to do it.","Nature encourages no looseness; pardons no errors.","Masses are rude, lame, unmade, pernicious in their demands and influence, and need not to be flattered, but to be schooled. I wish not to concede anything to them, but to tame, drill, divide, and break them up, and draw individuals out of them.","At the gates of the forest, the surprised man of the world is forced to leave his city estimates of great and small, wise and foolish. The knapsack of custom falls off his back with the first step he makes into these precincts. Here is sanctity which shames our religions, and reality which discredits our heroes. Here we find Nature to be the circumstance which dwarfs every other circumstance, and judges like a god all men that come to her.","Polarity, or action and reaction, we meet in every part of nature; in darkness and light; in heat and cold; in the ebb and flow of water; in male and female; in the equation of quantity and quality; in the fluids of the animal body; in the systole an","I hate to be defended in a newspaper. As long as all that is said is said against me, I feel a certain assurance of success. But as soon as honeyed words of praise are spoken for me, I feel as one that lies unprotected before his enemies.","It is defeat which educates us.","To make knowledge valuable, you must have the cheerfulness of wisdom.","The blazing evidence of immortality is our dissatisfaction with any other solution.","A strenuous soul hates cheap success. It is the ardor of the assailant that makes the vigor of the defendant.","Come out of the azure. Love the day. Do not leave the sky out of your landscape.","Society does not love its unmaskers.","Envy is the tax which all distinction must pay.","Life is unnecessarily long.

We do not teach them to aspire to be all they can. We do not give them a training as if webelieved in their noble nature. We scarce educate their bodies. We do not train the eye and the hand. We exercise their understandings to the apprehension and comparison of some facts, to a skill in numbers, in words; we aim to make accountants, attorneys, engineers; but not to make able, earnest, great- hearted men.","You do not get power so that you can go out and do things, you go out and do things and you will get the power","The hero is he who is immovably centered.","When it is darkest, we can see the stars.","No man thoroughly understands a truth until he has contended against it.","The education of the will is the object of our existence.","The vanishing, volatile froth of the present which any shadow will alter, any thought blow away, any event annihilate, is every moment converted into the adamantine.","Everything in nature goes by law, and not by luck.","Knowledge is the antidote to fear","Money, which represents the prose of life, and which is hardly spoken of in parlors without an apology, is, in its effects and laws, as beautiful as roses.","All writing is by the grace of God. People do not deserve to have good writing, they are so pleased with bad. In these sentences that you show me, I can find no beauty, for I see death in every clause and every word. There is a fossil or a mummy character which pervades this book. The best sepulchers, the vastest catacombs, Thebes and Cairo, Pyramids, are sepulchers to me. I like gardens and nurseries. Give me initiative, spermatic, prophesying, man-making words.","It is the privilege of any human work which is well done to invest the doer with a certain haughtiness. He can well afford not to conciliate, whose faithful work will answer for him.","Philosophically considered, the universe is composed of Nature and the Soul.","It seems to be a rule of wisdom never to rely on your memory alone, scarcely even in acts of pure memory, but to bring the past for judgment into the thousand-eyed present, and live ever in a new day.","Let a man then know his worth and keep things under his feet.","Freedom is not the right to live as we please, but the right to find how we ought to live in order to fulfill our potential.","Why should we fear to be crushed by savage elements, we who are made up of the same elements?","Power obeys reality, and not appearances; power is according to quality, and not quantity.","There is a remedy for every wrong and a satisfaction for every soul.","You cannot sincerely try to help another without helping yourself","Few people know how to take a walk.

It is one soul which animates all men.","Thought is the blossom; language the bud; action the fruit behind it.","The poet alone knows astronomy, chemistry, vegetation, and animation, for he does not stop at these facts, but employs them as signs. He knows why the plain, or meadow of space, was strown with these flowers we call suns, and moons, and stars; why the deep is adorned with animals, with men, and gods; for, in every word he speaks he rides on them as the horses of thought.","Intellectual tasting of life will not supersede muscular activity.","We are taught by great actions that the universe is the property of every individual in it.","The State must follow, and not lead, the character and progress of the citizen.","Words are alive.

And the end of culture is not to destroy this, God forbid! but to train away all impediment and mixture and leave nothing but pure power.","I feel the same truth how often in my trivial conversation with my neighbours, that somewhat higher in each of us overlooks this by-play, and Jove nods to Jove from behind each of us.","Every artist was first an amateur.","The revelation of thought takes men out of servitude into freedom.","People with great gifts are easy to find, but symmetrical and balanced ones never.","In the highest civilization, the book is still the highest delight.

What is useful will last, what is hurtful will sink.","Hospitality consists in a little fire, a little food, and an immense quiet","The mob is man voluntarily descending to the nature of the beast.","The quality of the imagination is to flow and not to freeze.","Knowledge exists to be imparted.","In good writing, words become one with things.","Welcome evermore to gods and men is the self-helping man.","Those who are esteemed umpires of taste, are often persons who have acquired some knowledge of admired pictures or sculptures, andhave an inclination for whatever is elegant; but if you inquire whether they are beautiful souls, and whether their own acts are like fair pictures, you learn that they are selfish and sensual. Their cultivation is local, as if you should rub a log of dry wood in one spot to produce fire, all the rest remaining cold.","Each man has an aptitude born with him. Do your work.","Man is the end of nature; nothing so easily organizes itself in every part of the universe as he; no moss, no lichen is so easilyborn; and he takes along with him and puts out from himself the whole apparatus of society and condition extempore, as an army encamps in a desert, and where all was just now blowing sand, creates a white city in an hour, a government, a market, a place for feasting, for conversation, and for love.","Nature is a mutable cloud which is always and never the same.","Every man contemplates an angel in his future self.","Live, let live, and help live","Love of beauty is taste.

The difference between landscape and landscape is small, but there is a great difference in beholders.","The evils of popular government appear greater than they are; there is compensation for them in spirit and energy it awakens.","The moment our discourse rises above the ground-line of familiar facts, and is inflamed with passion or exalted thought, it clothes itself in images. A man conversing in earnest, if he watch his intellectual processes, will find that always a material image, more or less luminous, arises in his mind, contemporaneous with every thought, which furnishes the vestment of the thought.... This imagery is spontaneous. It is the blending of experience with the present action of the mind. It is proper creation.","Every man passes his life in the search after friendship.","Delicious is a just and firm encounter of two in a thought, in a feeling.","Of course you will insist on modesty in the children, and respect to their teachers, but if the boy stops you in your speech, cries out that you are wrong and sets you right, hug him!","Truth has already ceased to be itself if polemically said.","A mob cannot be a permanency: everybody\'s interest requires that it should not exist, and only justice satisfies all.","What matters most is not what is behind us or before us, but what is within us.","Infancy conforms to nobody: all conform to it, so that one babe commonly makes four or five out of the adults who prattle and play to it.","The whole value of the dime is in knowing what to do with it.","There are days when the great are near us, when there is no frown on their brow, no condescension even; when they take us by the hand, and we share their thought.","There are many things of which a wise man might wish to be ignorant","Beauty is the virtue of the body as virtue is the beauty of the soul","There are no days in life so memorable as those which vibrate to some stroke of the imagination.","Men of God have always, from time to time, walked among men, and made their commission felt in the heart and soul of the commonest hearer.","A lady with whom I was riding in the forest said to me that the woods always seemed to her to wait, as if the genii who inhabit them suspend their deeds until the wayfarer had passed onward; a thought which poetry has celebrated in the dance of the fairies, which breaks off on the approach of human feet.","People forget that it is the eye which makes the horizon, and the rounding mind\'s eye which makes this or that man a type or representative of humanity with the name of hero or saint.","My joy in friends, those sacred people, is my consolation.","Our friends early appear to us as representatives of certain ideas, which they never pass or exceed. They stand on the brink of the ocean of thought and power, but they never take a single step that would bring them there.","When we attempt to define and describe God, both language and thought desert us, and we are as helpless as fools and savages.","Practice radical humility.\\" He (or she)who masters the art of humility cannot be humiliated.","Every great institution is the lengthened shadow of a single man. His character determines the character of the organization.","Truth, and goodness, and beauty, are but different faces of the same All","In a world of infinite choice people are struggling to figure out what to do.","When we have arrived at the question, the answer is already near.","Of Nature itself upon the soul; the sunrise, the haze of autumn, the winter starlight seem interlocutors; the prevailing sense is that of an exposition in poetry; a high discourse, the voice of the speaker seems to breathe as much from the landscape as from his own breast; it is Nature communing with the seer.","Every revolution was first a thought in one man\'s mind.","Every vice is only an exaggeration of a necessary and virtuous function.","A little fact is worth a whole limbo of dreams.","Character is always known. Thefts never enrich; alms never impoverish; murder will speak out of stone walls.","The secret of the world is the tie between person and event.

I am not alone and unacknowledged.  They nod to me and I to them.","Let the stoics say what they please, we do not eat for the good of living, but because the meat is savory and the appetite is keen.","Shallow men believe in luck.","Good manners are made up of petty sacrifices.","For poetry was all written before time was, and whenever we are so finely organized that we can penetrate into that region where the air is music, we hear those primal warblings, and attempt to write them down, but we lose ever and anon a word, a verse, and substitute something of our own, and thus miswrite the poem.","Let us draw a lesson from nature, which always works by short ways. When the fruit is ripe, it falls.","The man is only half himself, the other half is his expression.","We do not live an equal life, but one of contrasts and patchwork; now a little joy, then a sorrow, now a sin, then a generous or brave action.","If man has good corn, or wood, or boards, or pigs to sell, or can make better chairs or knives, crucibles, or church organs, than anybody else, you will find a broad, hard-beaten road to his house, though it be in the woods.","There are other measures of self-respect for a man, than the number of clean shirts he puts on every day.","My life should be unique; it should be an alms, a battle, a conquest, a medicine.","God will not have his work made manifest by cowards","No rent-roll nor army-list can dignify skulking and dissimulation: and the first point of courtesy must always be truth, as really all the forms of good-breeding point that way.","Say thank you! I want to hear you say it now. Out loud. \'Thank you.\'  You\'re saying thank you because your faith is so strong that you don\'t doubt that whatever the problem, you\'ll get through it.   You\'re saying thank you because you know that even in the eye of the storm, God has put a rainbow in the clouds. You\'re saying thank you because you know there\'s no problem created that can compare to the Creator of all things. Say thank you!","Higher than the question of our duration is the question of our deserving. Immortality will come to such as are fit for it, and he would be a great soul in future must be a great soul now.","Genius Borrows nobly.","Sympathy is a supporting atmosphere, and in it we unfold easily and well.","Talent alone cannot make a writer. There must be a man behind the book; a personality which, by birth and quality, is pledged to the doctrines there set forth, and which exists to see and state things so, and not otherwise.","We love flattery, even though we are not deceived by it, because it shows that we are of importance enough to be courted.","See only that thou work and thou canst not escape the reward.","I like people who can do things","A vivid thought brings the power to paint it; and in proportion to the depth of its source is the force of its projection.","What the tender and poetic youth dreams to-day, and conjures up with inarticulate speech, is to-morrow the vociferated result of public opinion, and the day after is the character of nations.","A man is the facade of a temple wherein all wisdom and all good abide.","No one has a prosperity so high and firm that two or three words can\'t dishearten it.","The virtues of society are vices of the saint.

To a man laboring under calamity, the heat of his own fire hath sadness in it.","What is it men love in Genius, but its infinite hope, which degrades all it has done? Genius counts all its miracles poor and short. Its own idea it never executed.","Great geniuses have the shortest biographies. Their cousins can tell you nothing about them. They lived in their writings, and sotheir house and street life was trivial and commonplace. If you would know their tastes and complexions, the most admiring of their readers most resembles them.","And what is Genius but finer love, a love impersonal, a love of the flower and perfection of things, and a desire to draw a new picture or copy of the same? It looks to the cause and life: it proceeds from within outward, whilst Talent goes from without inward.","Genius is its own end.","But genius is religious. It is a larger imbibing of the common heart.","The boxer\'s ring is the enjoyment of the part of society whose animal nature alone has been developed.","The flowers talk when the wind blows over them.","Mankind have such a deep stake in inward illumination, that there is much to be said by the hermit or monk in defence of his life of thought and prayer.","When its errands are noble and adequate, a steamboat bridging the Atlantic between Old and New England, and arriving at its ports with the punctuality of a planet, is a step of man into harmony with nature.","But the nomads were the terror of all those whom the soil or the advantages of the market had induced to build towns. Agriculture therefore was a religious injunction, because of the perils of the state from nomadism.","The nonconformist and the rebel say all manner of unanswerable things against the existing republic, but discover to our sense no plan of house or state of their own.","If you visit your friend, why need you apologize for not having visited him, and waste his time and deface your own act?

The warmer their expressions, the colder we feel.... Cure the drunkard, heal the insane, mollify the homicide, civilize the Pawnee, but what lessons can be devised for the debauchee of sentiment?","But in our experience, man is cheap and friendship wants its deep sense.

Let Him help put you together.","The poem is a confession of faith.","When believers and unbelievers live in the same manner - I distrust the religion.","Therefore is nature ever the ally of Religion: lends her all her pomp and riches to the religious sentiment.","Ethics and religion differ herein; that the one is the system of human duties commencing from man; the other, from God. Religion includes the personality of God; Ethics does not.","Each religious sect has its own physiognomy. The Methodists have acquired a face; the Quakers, a face; the nuns, a face. An Englishman will pick out a dissenter by his manners.","Good churches are not built by bad men; at least, there must be probity and enthusiasm somewhere in the society. These minsters were neither built nor filled by atheists.","Everywhere I am hindered of meeting God in my brother, because he has shut his own temple doors and recites fables merely of his brother\'s, or his brother\'s brother\'s God.","Life is comic or pitiful as soon as the high ends of being fade out of sight, and man becomes near-sighted, and can only attend towhat addresses the senses.","Europe has always owed to oriental genius its divine impulses. What these holy bards said, all sane men found agreeable and true.","The moment the doctrine of the immortality is separately taught, man is already fallen. In the flowing of love, in the adoration of humility, there is no question of continuance. No inspired man ever asks this question, or condescends to these evidences. For the soul is true to itself, and the man in whom it is shed abroad cannot wander from the present, which is infinite, to a future which would be finite.","Our religion vulgarly stands on numbers of believers. Whenever the appeal is made--no matter how indirectly--to numbers, proclamation is then and there made, that religion is not.

How shall I live? We are incompetent to solve the times. Our geometry cannot span the huge orbits of the prevailing ideas, behold their return, and reconcile their opposition. We can only obey our own polarity.","Man is the broken giant, and in all his weakness both his body and his mind are invigorated by habits of conversation with nature.","Genius detects through the fly, through the caterpillar, through the grub, through the egg, the constant individual; through countless individuals the fixed species; through many species the genus; through all genera the steadfast type; through all the kingdoms of organized life the eternal unity. Nature is a mutable cloud which is always and never the same.","The kingdom of man over nature, which cometh not with observation,--a dominion such as now is beyond his dream of God,--he shall enter without more wonder than the blind man feels who is gradually restored to perfect sight.","Every rational creature has all nature for his dowry and estate. It is his, if he will.

All are needed by each one; Nothing is fair or good alone.","God said, I am tired of kings, I suffer them no more; Up to my ear this morning brings The outrage of the poor.","I look on that man as happy, who, when there is question of success, looks into his work for a reply.","A sage is the instructor of a hundred ages.","Take the place and attitude to which you see your unquestionable right, and all men acquiesce.","Skepticism is slow suicide.","The silence that accepts merit as the most natural thing in the world is the highest applause.","Meek young men grow up in libraries, believing it their duty to accept the views which Cicero, which Locke, which Bacon, have given, forgetful that Cicero, Locke, and Bacon were only young men in libraries, when they wrote these books.","The leaves are falling, falling as from way off, as though far gardens withered in the skies; they are falling with denying gestures. And in the nights the heavy earth is falling from all the stars down into loneliness. We all are falling. This hand falls. And look at others: it is in them all. And yet there is one who holds this falling endlessly gently in his hands.","Society never advances.  It recedes as fast on one side as it gains on the other.  Society acquires new arts, and loses old instincts.","The wonder is always new that any sane man can be a sailor.","Society is a hospital of incurables.","Society always consists in the greatest part, of young and foolish persons.","Society is a masked ball, where every one hides his real character, and reveals it by hiding.","Silence is a solvent that destroys personality, and gives us leave to be great and universal.","He who knows what sweets and virtues are in the ground, the plants, the waters, the heavens, and how to come at these enchantments - is the rich and royal man.","The history of persecution is a history of endeavors to cheat nature, to make water run up hill, to twist a rope of sand.","More than the diamond Koh-i-noor, which glitters among their crown jewels, they prize the dull pebble which is wiser than a man, whose poles turn themselves to the poles of the world, and whose axis is parallel to the axis of the world. Now, their toys are steam and galvanism.","The rich mind lies in the sun and sleeps, and is Nature.","There is no thought in any mind, but it quickly tends to convert itself into power.","Talent for talent\'s sake is a bauble and a show. Talent working with joy in the cause of universal truth lifts the possessor to new power as a benefactor.","The poisons are our principal medicines, which kill the disease and save the life.","Everything in the universe goes by indirection. There are no straight lines.","Talent is commonly developed at the expense of character.","It is long ere we discover how rich we are. Our history, we are sure, is quite tame: we have nothing to write, nothing to infer. But our wiser years still run back to the despised recollections of childhood, and always we are fishing up some wonderful article out of that pond; until, by and by, we begin to suspect that the biography of the one foolish person we know is, in reality, nothing less than the miniature paraphrase of the hundred volumes of the Universal History.","Man is endogenous, and education is his unfolding. The aid we have from others is mechanical, compared with the discoveries of nature in us. What is thus learned is delightful in the doing, and the effect remains.","Every man who would do anything well, must come to it from a higher ground.","A man must be clothed with society, or we shall feel a certain bareness and poverty, as of a displaced and unfurnished member. He is to be dressed in arts and institutions, as well as in body garments. Now and then a man exquisitely made can live alone, and must; but coop up most men and you undo them.","The power men possess to annoy me I give them by a weak curiosity","Some men\'s words I remember so well that I must often use them to express my thought. Yes, because I perceive that we have heard the same truth, but they have heard it better.","How many attractions for us have our passing fellows in the streets, both male and female, which our ethics forbid us to express, which yet infuse so much pleasure into life. A lovely child, a handsome youth, a beautiful girl, a heroic man, a maternal woman, a venerable old man, charm us, though strangers, and we cannot say so, or look at them but for a moment.","The visible heavens and earth sympathize with Jesus.","In a cabinet of natural history, we become sensible of a certain occult recognition and sympathy in regard to the most unwieldy and eccentric forms of beast, fish, and insect.","The use of natural history is to give us aid in supernatural history: the use of the outer creation, to give us language for the beings and changes of the inward creation.","Nature will not let us fret and fume. She does not like our benevolence or our learning much better than she likes our frauds andwars. When we come out of the caucus, or the bank, or the abolition-convention, or the temperance-meeting, or the transcendental club, into the fields and woods, she says to us, \\"so hot? my little Sir.","I do not hesitate to read. all good books in translations. What is really best in any book is translatable-any real insight or broad human sentiment.","Genius has infused itself into nature. It indicates itself by a small excess of good, a small balance in brute facts always favorable to the side of reason.","Nature has her own best mode of doing each thing, and she has somewhere told it plainly, if we will keep our eyes and ears open. If not, she will not be slow in undeceiving us, when we prefer our own way to hers.","There is no man of Nature\'s worth\\nIn the circle of the earth.","Intellect is a fire; rash and pitiless it melts this wonderful bone-house which is called man. Genius even, as it is the greatestgood, is the greatest harm.","When the gods come among men, they are not known.","The never-ending task of self improvement.","The great make its feel, first of all, the indifference of circumstances. They call into activity the higher perceptions, and subdue the low habits of comfort and luxury; but the higher perceptions find their objects everywhere; only the low habits need palaces and banquets.","Beauty without expression is boring.","There is creative reading as well as creative writing.","When we quarrel, how we wish we had been blameless.","The essence of greatness is the perception that virtue is enough.","What\'s a book?  Everything or nothing.  The eye that sees it all.","If we live truly, we shall see truly.","Nothing is secure but life, transition, the energizing spirit.","Money often costs too much.","The ship of heaven guides itself and will not accept a wooden rudder.","Curiosity is lying in wait for every secret.","Every genuine work of art has as much reason for being as the earth and the sun.","Truth is handsomer than the affectation of love. Your goodness must have some edge to it, else it is none.","Write it on your heart that every day is the best day in the year. No man has learned anything rightly, until he knows that every day is Doomsday.","Our life is an apprenticeship to the truth that around every circle another can be drawn; that there is no end in nature, but every end is a beginning, and under every deep a lower deep opens.","Who shall set a limit to the influence of a human being?","Every natural action is graceful.","Old and new make the warp and woof of every moment. There is no thread that is not a twist of these two strands.","The virtue of books is to be readable.","We ascribe beauty to that which is simple; which has no superfluous parts; which exactly answers its end; which stands related to all things; which is the mean of many extremes.","We have a great deal more kindness than is ever spoken.","In Nature, all is useful, all is beautiful","Another sort of false prayers are our regrets. Discontent is the way of self-reliance: it is infirmity of will. Regret calamities, if you can thereby help the sufferer; if not, attend your own work, and already the evil begins to be repaired.","One thing is forever good; That one thing is Success.","Right is more beautiful than private affection, and is compatible with universal wisdom.","Behind every individual closes organization; before him opens liberty,--the Better, the Best. The first and worse races are dead.The second and imperfect races are dying out, or remain for the maturing of the higher. In the latest race, in man, every generosity, every new perception, the love and praise he extorts from his fellows, are certificates of advance out of fate into freedom.","Men do not believe in the power of education. We do not think we can speak to divine sentiments in man, and we do not try. We renounce all high aims.","The advantage in education is always with those children who slip up into life without being objects of notice.","To be great, you must be misunderstood","In the Fiji islands, it appears, cannibalism is now familiar. They eat thier own wives and children. We only devour widows\' houses, and great merchants outwit and absorb the substance of small ones, and every man feeds on his neighbor\'s labor if he can. It is a milder form of cannibalism.","I shun father and mother and wife and brother, when my genius calls me.","Adult males are what their moms designed them.","Happy is the house that shelters a friend.","Passion rebuilds the world for the youth. It makes all things alive and significant.","Men love to wonder, and that is the seed of science.","It was high counsel that I once heard given to a young person, \'always do what you are afraid to do.\'","The search after the great men is the dream of youth, and the most serious occupation of manhood.","Every sentence spoken by Napoleon, and every line of his writing, deserves reading, as it is the sense of France.","A man should learn to detect and watch that gleam of light which flashes across his mind from within, more than the lustre of the firmament of bards and sages. Yet he dismisses without notice his thought, because it is his. In every work of genius we recognize our own rejected thoughts: they come back to us with a certain alienated majesty.","Every spirit builds itself a house; and beyond its house a world; and beyond its world, a heaven. Know then, that the world exists for you. For you is the phenomenon perfect. What we are, that only can we see. All that Adam had, all that Caesar could, you have and can do. Adam called his house, heaven and earth; Caesar called his house, Rome; you perhaps call yours, a cobler\'s trade; a hundred acres of ploughed land; or a scholar\'s garret. Yet line for line and point for point, your dominion is as great as theirs, though without fine names. Build, therefore, your own world.","Men are conservatives when they are least vigorous or when they are most luxurious-they are conservatives after dinner.","Every great achievement is the victory of a flaming heart.","It requires a great deal of boldness and a great deal of caution to make a great fortune, and when you have it, it requires ten times as much skill to keep it.","Sanity is very rare; every man almost and every woman has a dash of madness.","There is no good theory of disease which does not at once suggest a cure.","Sleep is not, death is not; Who seem to die Live. House you were born in, Friends of your spring-time, old man and young maid, Day\'s toil and it\'s guerdon, They are all vanishing, Fleeing to fables, Cannot be moored","But it is a cold, lifeless business when you go to the shops to buy something, which does not represent your life and talent, but a goldsmith\'s.","He who would be a man must therefore be a non-conformist.","The fox has many tricks. The hedgehog has but one. But that is the best of all.","The people are to be taken in very small doses.","The South-wind brings Life, sunshine and desire, And on every mount and meadow Breathes aromatic fire; But over the dead he has no power, The lost, the lost, he cannot restore; And, looking over the hills, I mourn The darling who shall not return.","Nature wishes that woman should attract man, yet she often cunningly moulds into her face a little sarcasm, which seems to say, \'Yes, I am willing to attract, but to attract a little better kind of a man than any I yet behold","The key to every man is his thought.","All successful men have agreed in one thing -- they were causationists. They believed that things went not by luck, but by law; that there was not a weak or a cracked link in the chain that joins the first and last of things.","The greatest genius is the most indebted person.","Books take their place according to their specific gravity as surely as potatoes in a tub.","Intemperance is the only vulgarity.","Talent may frolic and juggle; genius realizes and adds.","You think me the child of circumstance; I make my circumstance.","When a man becomes cultivated, he develops a new respect for who he is. This causes him to be ashamed of his past identification of himself and others according to things, i.e. property.","An individual has a healthy personality to the exact degree to which they have the propensity to look for the good in every situation.","In the morning a man walks with his whole body; in the evening, only with his legs.","The house praises the carpenter.","By persisting in your path, though you forfeit the little, you gain the great.","Things refuse to be mismanaged for long.","You cannot make a cheap palace.","The most advanced nations are always those who navigate the most.","Money is the representative of a certain quantity of corn or other commodity. It is so much warmth, so much bread.","Next to the originator of a good sentence is the first quoter of it.","There is always room for a person of force and they make room for many.","But whoso is heroic must find crises to try his edge. Human virtue demands her champions and martyrs, and the trial of persecution always proceeds.","I have sometimes thought that, in order to be a good minister, it was necessary to leave the ministry. The profession is antiquated. In an altered age, we worship in the dead forms of our forefathers.","Sunday is the core of our civilization, dedicated to thought and reverence.","I think the vice of our housekeeping is that it does not hold man sacred. The vice of government, the vice of education, the viceof religion, is one with that of the private life.","In different hours, a man represents each of several of his ancestors, as if there were seven or eight of us rolled up in each man\'s skin, - seven or eight ancestors at least, and they constitute the variety of notes for that new piece of music which his life is.","Each work of art excludes the world, concentrates attention on itself. For the time it is the only thing worth doing -to do just that; be it a sonnet, a statue, a landscape, an outline head of Caesar, or an oration. Presently we return to the sight of another that globes itself into a whole as did the first, for example, a beautiful garden; and nothing seems worth doing in life but laying out a garden.","Out of love and hatred, out of earnings and borrowings and leadings and losses; out of sickness and pain; out of wooing and worshipping; out of traveling and voting and watching and caring; out of disgrace and contempt, comes our tuition in the serene and beautiful laws.","Dear to us are those who love us... but dearer are those who reject us as unworthy, for they add another life; they build a heaven before us whereof we had not dreamed, and thereby supply to us new powers out of the recesses of the spirit, and urge us to new and unattempted performances.","Music causes us to think eloquently.","A man of genius is privileged only as far as he is genius. His dullness is as insupportable as any other dullness.","When I go into the garden with a spade and dig a bed I feel such an exhilaration and health that I discover that I have been defrauding myself all this time in letting others do for me what I should have done with my own hands.","Wisdom has its root in goodness, not goodness its root in wisdom.","The happiest man is he who learns from nature the lesson of worship","Astronomy to the selfish becomes astrology.","When the act of reflection takes place in the mind, when we look at ourselves in the light of thought, we discover that our life is embosomed in beauty.","Good writing is a kind of skating which carries off the performer where he would not go.","Self sacrifice is the real miracle out of which all the reported miracles grow.","Art is not to be found by touring to Egypt, China, or Peru; if you cannot find it at your own door, you will never find it.","It is only when mind and character slumber that the dress can be seen. If the intellect were always awake, and every noble sentiment, the man might go in huckaback or mats, and his dress would be admired and imitated.","In the great books of India, an empire spoke to us, nothing small or unworthy, but large, serene, consistent, the voice of an old intelligence, which in another age and climate had pondered and thus disposed of the questions that exercise us.","The life of man is the true romance, which when it is valiantly conduced, will yield the imagination a higher joy than any fiction.","If government knew how, I should like to see it check, not multiply, the population. When it reaches its true law of action, every man that is born will be hailed as essential.","The youth, intoxicated with his admiration of a hero, fails to see, that it is only a projection of his own soul, which he admires.","All diseases run into one, old age.","Astronomy taught us our insignificance in Nature.","The efforts which we make to escape from our destiny only serve to lead us into it.","The secret of success lies never in the amount of money, but in the relation of income to outgo.","Marriage (in what is called the spiritual world) is impossible, because of the inequality between every subject and every object.","But when you have chosen your part, abide by it, and do not weakly try to reconcile yourself with the world.","A weed is a plant whose virtue is not yet known.","My son, a perfect little boy of five years and three months, had ended his earthly life. You can never sympathize with me; you can never know how much of me such a young child can take away. A few weeks ago I accounted myself a very rich man, and now the poorest of all.","Go forth into the busy world and love it. Interest yourself in its life, mingle kindly with its joys and sorrows.","The power which resides in him is new in nature, and none but he knows what that is which he can do, nor does he know until he has tried.","The great majority of men are bundles of beginnings","When I first open my eyes upon the morning meadows and look out upon the beautiful world, I thank God I am alive.","I cannot find language of sufficient energy to convey my sense of the sacredness of private integrity.","Only an inventor knows how to borrow, and every man is or should be an inventor.","If a man sits down to think, he is immediately asked if he has a headache.","Every actual State is corrupt. Good men must not obey the laws too well. What satire on government can equal the severity of censure conveyed in the word politics ....?","Let me admonish you, first of all, to go alone; to refuse the good models, even those which are sacred in the imagination of men, and dare to love God without mediator or veil.","We must hold a man amenable to reason for the choice of his daily craft or profession.

What business has he with an evil trade?","The power of a man increases steadily by continuing in one direction.","The bitterest tragic element in life to be derived from an intellectual source is the belief in a brute Fate or Destiny.","But genius looks forward: the eyes of men are set in his forehead, not in his hindhead: man hopes: genius creates.","We aim above the mark, to hit the mark. Every act hath some falsehood of exaggeration in it.","If a man lose his balance, and immerse himself in any trades or pleasures for their own sake, he may be a good wheel or pin, but he is not a cultivated man.","Shakspeare is the only biographer of Shakspeare; and even he can tell nothing, except to the Shakspeare in us; that is, to our most apprehensive and sympathetic hour.","Many a man had taken the first step. With every additional step you enhance immensely the value of your first.","Nothing can work damage to me except myself; the harm that I sustain I carry about with me and never am a real sufferer except by my own fault.","Bonaparte knew but one merit, and rewarded in one and the same way the good soldier, the good astronomer, the good poet, the good player.","I will not hide my tastes or aversions. If you are true, but not in the same truth with me, cleave to your companions; I will seek my own.","Every natural fact is a symbol of some spiritual fact.","When It\'s Darkest, Men See the Stars.","The way to mend the bad world is to create the right world.","I hate quotations. Tell me what you know.","We are wiser than we know.","Finish each day before you begin the next, and interpose a solid wall of sleep between the two. This you cannot do without temperance.","He that can heroically endure adversity will bear prosperity with equal greatest of the soul; for the mind that cannot be dejected by the former is not likely to be transported without the latter.","The religions of the world are the ejaculations of a few imaginative men.","I like to have a person\'s knowledge comprehend more than one class of topics, one row of shelves. I like a person who likes to see a fine barn as well as a good tragedy.","Men cease to interest us when we find their limitations. The only sin is limitation. As soon as you once come up with a man\'s limitations, it is all over with him.","though the wide universe is full of good, no kernel of nourishing corn can come to him but through his toil bestowed on that plot of ground which is given to him to till.","Each man is a hero and an oracle to somebody.","I do not wish to remove from my present prison to a prison a little larger. I wish to break all prisons.","We dress our garden, eat our dinners, discuss the household with our wives, and these things make no impression, are forgotten next week; but in the solitude to which every man is always returning, he has a sanity and revelations, which in his passage into new worlds he will carry with him. Never mind the ridicule, never mind the defeat: up again, old heart! \u2014 it seems to say, \u2014 there is victory yet for all justice; and the true romance which the world exists to realize, will be the transformation of genius into practical power.","Pictures must not be too picturesque.","To the body and mind which have been cramped by noxious work or company, nature is medicinal and restores their tone. The tradesman, the attorney comes out of the din and craft of the street and sees the sky and the woods, and is a man again. In their eternal calm, he finds himself.","My life is not an apology, but a life. It is for itself and not for a spectacle. I much prefer that it should be of a lower strain, so it be genuine and equal, than that it should be glittering and unsteady.","He takes men out of time and makes them feel eternity.","Everything in creation has its appointed painter or poet and remains in bondage like the princess in the fairy tale \'til its appropriate liberator comes to set it free.","Thus inevitably does the universe wear our color, and every object fall successively into the subject itself. The subject exists, the subject enlarges; all things sooner or later fall into place.

The first time you hear it, it sounds rather as if copied out of some invisible tablet in the Eternal mind than as if arbitrarily composed by the poet.","Nature is methodical, and doeth her work well. Time is never to be hurried.","Every natural power exhilarates; a true talent delights the possessor first.","Knowledge is the antidote to fear. [especially as fear often stands for false evidence appearing real!]","The poorest experience is rich enough for all the purposes of expressing thought","It is the duty of men to judge men only by their actions.

Its chief good is for well-mixed people who can enjoy what they find, without question.","Sickness is poor-spirited, and cannot serve anyone; it must husband its resources to live. But health or fullness answers its own ends, and has to spare, runs over, and inundates the neighborhoods and creeks of other men\'s necessities.","Do what you know and perception is converted into character.","All great masters are chiefly distinguished by the power of adding a second, a third, and perhaps a fourth step in a continuous line.

There is even no philosopher who is a philosopher at all times. Our experience, our perception is conditioned by the need to acquire in parts and in succession, that is, with every truth a certain falsehood.","If you criticize a fine genius, the odds are that you are out of your reckoning, and, instead of the poet, are censuring your owncaricature of him.","Behind us, as we go, all things assume pleasing forms, as clouds do far off. Not only things familiar and stale, but even the tragic and terrible, are comely, as they take their place in the pictures of memory.","A great man scarcely knows how he dines, how he dresses; but without railing or precision, his living is natural and poetic.","As we grow old, the beauty steals inward.","Crime and punishment grow out of one stem. Punishment is a fruit that unsuspected ripens within the flower of the pleasure which concealed it.","Must we always talk for victory, and never once for truth, for comfort, and joy?","Many might go to Heaven with half the labor they go to hell.","The soul is the perceiver and revealer of truth. We know truth when we see it, let skeptic and scoffer say what they choose.","You take a weakness and start making it stronger.. You don\'t have to build your strengths - that you already possess... It is your weakness that needs the exercise","Beauty is the pilot of the young soul.","As the eye is the best composer, so light is the first of painters. There is no object so foul that intense light will not make beautiful; and the stimulus it affords to the sense, and a sort of infinitude which it hath like space and time, make all matter gay.","Wise cultivated, genial conversation is the last flower of civilization, and the best result which life has to offer us,--a cup for gods, which has no repentance.

The most fugitive deed and word, the intimated purpose, express character.","The beautiful rests on the foundations of the necessary.","Liberty is slow fruit. It is never cheap; it is made difficult because freedom is the accomplishment and perfectness of man.","No one can read the history of astronomy without perceiving that Copernicus, Newton, Laplace, are not new men, or a new kind of men, but that Thales, Anaximenes, Hipparchus, Empodocles, Aristorchus, Pythagorus, Oenipodes, had anticipated them.","Drive out Nature with a fork, she comes running back.","The prayer of the farmer kneeling in his field to weed it, the prayer of the rower kneeling with the stroke of his oar, are true prayers heard throughout nature.","The world is plentiful with honey, but only the humble bee can collect it.","Of cheerfulness, or a good temper - the more it is spent, the more of it remains.","There are always difficulties arising that tempt you to believe your critics are right.","We cannot overstate our debt to the Past, but the moment has the supreme claim.","Be an opener of doors","Light is the first of painters. There is no object so foul that intense light will not make it beautiful.","Beauty is the mark God sets on virtue. Every natural action is graceful; every heroic act is also decent, and causes the place and the bystanders to shine.","Great is paint; nay, God is the painter; and we rightly accuse the critic who destroys too many illusions.

In this ship of humanity, Will is the rudder, and Sentiment the sail; when woman affects to steer, the rudder is only a masked sail.","A man is a god in ruins.","Keep cool: it will be all one a hundred years hence.","Nature hates monopolies and exceptions.","The faith that stands on authority is not faith.","Man is a piece of the universe made alive","Art should exhilarate, and throw down the walls of circumstance on every side, awakening in the beholder the same sense of universal relation and power which the work evinced in the artist.","We forget ourselves and our destinies in health, and the chief use of temporary sickness is to remind us of these concerns.","The reward of commercial civilization is the ability to consume a never-ending array of products.There are limits beyond which commodities cannot be multiplied without preventing their consumers from affirming themselves through the exercise of their personal freedom.When market dependence reaches a certain threshold it deprives people of their power to live creatively and to act autonomously. And precisely because this new impotence is so deeply experienced, it is expressed with difficulty.","There is health in table talk and nursery play. We must wear old shoes and have aunts and cousins.","Isolation must precede true society.","The two terrors that discourage creativity and creative living are fear of public opinion and undue reverence for one\'s own consistency.","If you don\'t ride in the rain, you don\'t ride.","The whole of heraldry and of chivalry is in courtesy. A man of fine manners shall pronounce your name with all the ornament that titles of nobility could ever add.","Friends should be like books, easy to find when you need them, but seldom used.","There are always two parties;\\n the establishment and the movement.","Plato says that the punishment which the wise suffer who refuse to take part in the government, is, to live under the government of worse men; and the like regret is suggested to all the auditors, as the penalty of abstaining to speak,--that they shall hear worse orators than themselves.","Sleep takes off the costume of circumstance, arms us with terrible freedom, so that every will rushes to deed. A skillful man reads his dreams for his self-knowledge; yet not the details, but the quality. What part does he play in them - a cheerful, manly part, or a poor, drivelling part? However monstrous and grotesque their apparitions, they have a substantial truth.","Nature is not slow to equip us in the prison-uniform of the party to which we adhere.","When duty whispers low, Thou must, The youth replies, I can.","Old & New put their stamp to everything in Nature. The snowflake that is now falling is marked by both. The present moment gives the motion & the color of the flake: Antiquity, its form & properties. All things wear a luster which is the gift of the present & a tarnish of time.","The soul comes from without into the human body, as into a temporary abode, and it goes out of it anew\x85 it passes into other habitations, for the soul is immortal.","To help the young soul, to add energy, inspire hope, and blow the coals into a useful flame; to redeem defeat by new thought and firm action, this, though not easy, is the work of divine men.","Traveling is a fool\'s paradise. Our first journeys discover to us the indifference of places.","Always scorn appearances and you always may.","My life is for itself and not for a spectacle.","Friends are like spaghetti, they should stick together. The only way to have a friend is to be one.","There are not in the world at any one time more than a dozen persons who read and understand Plato:-never enough to pay for an edition of his works; yet to every generation these come duly down, for the sake of those few persons, as if God brought them written in his hand.","Society acquires new arts, and loses old instincts.","The sower may mistake and sow his peas crookedly; the peas make no mistake, but come up and show his line.","It is a sign of our times, conspicuous to the coarsest observer, that many intelligent and religious persons withdraw themselves from the common labors and competitions of the market and the caucus, and betake themselves to a certain solitary and critical way of living, from which no solid fruit has yet appeared to justify their separation.","It is true that the discerning intellect of the world is always much in advance of the creative, so that there are competent judges of the best book, and few writers of the best books.","There is the illusion of time, which is very deep; who has disposed of it? Mor come to the conviction that what seems the succession of thought is only the distribution of wholes into causal series.","We live in a very low state of the world, and pay unwilling tribute to government founded on force. There is not, among the most religious and instructed men of the most religious and civil nations, a reliance on the moral sentiment, and a sufficient belief in the unity of things to persuade them that society can be maintained without artificial restraints, as well as the solar system; or that the private citizen might be reasonable, and a good neighbor, without the hint of a jail or a confiscation.","Great causes are never tried on their merits; but the cause is reduced to particulars to suit the size of the partizans, and the contention is ever hottest on minor matters.","Conversation is our account of ourselves...Conversation is the vent of character as well as thoughts...It is the laboratory of the student.","Friendship requires more time than poor busy men can usually command.","If the race is good, so is the place.","Life is wasted in the necessary preparation of finding what is the true way, and we die just as we enter it.","One more royal trait properly belongs to the poet. I mean his cheerfulness, without which no man can be a poet,--for beauty is his aim. He loves virtue, not for its obligation, but for its grace; he delights in the world, in man, in woman, for the lovely light that sparkles from them. Beauty, the spirit of joy and hilarity, he sheds over the universe.","I will no longer confer, differ, refer, defer, prefer, or suffer. I renounce the whole tribe of fero. I embrace absolute life.","But the best read naturalist who lends an entire and devout attention to truth, will see that there remains much to learn of his relation to the world, and that it is not to be learned by any addition or subtraction or other comparison of known quantities, but is arrived at by untaught sallies of the spirit, by a continual self-recovery, and by entire humility.","I shun father and mother and wife and brother when my genius calls me. I would write on the lintels of the door-post, Whim. I hope that it is somewhat better than whim at last, but we cannot spend the day in explanation.","Some people will tell you there is a great deal of poetry and fine sentiment in a chest of tea.","It does not to dwell on dreams and forget to live, but it is equally foolish to ignore the past \u2013 never forget.","Self trust is the essence of heroism.","We ask for long life, but \'tis deep life, or noble moments that signify. Let the measure of time be spiritual, not mechanical.","I know of no such unquestionable badge and ensign of a sovereign mind as that of tenacity of purpose.","Every hero becomes a bore at last.","From within or from behind, a light shines through us upon things, and makes us aware that we are nothing, but the light is all.","Courage charms us, because it indicates that a man loves an idea better than all things in the world, that he is thinking neither of his bed, nor his dinner, nor his money, but will venture all to put in act the invisible thought of his mind.","There is no strong performance without a little fanaticism in the performer.","If you believe in fate, believe in it, at least, for your good.","What torments of grief you endured, from evils that never arrived","To finish the moment, to find the journey\'s end in every step of the road, to live the greatest number of good hours, is wisdom.","A garden has this advantage, that it makes it indifferent where you live. A well-laid garden makes the face of the country of no account; let that be low or high, grand or mean, you have made a beautiful abode worthy of man.","Everything runs to excess; every good quality is noxious if unmixed.","Success in your work, the finding a better method, the better understanding that insures the better performing is hat and coat, is food and wine, is fire and horse and health and holiday. At least, I find that any success in my work has the effect on my spirits of all these.","Children are all foreigners.","A man is like a bit of Labrador spar, which has no luster as you turn it in your hand, until you come to a particular angle; then it shows deep and beautiful colors.","Every thought which genius and piety throw into the world alters the world.","The light by which we see in this world comes out from the soul of the observer. Wherever any noble sentiment dwelt, it made the faces and houses around to shine. Nay, the powers of this busy brain are miraculous and illimitable.","Do you see that kitten chasing so prettily her own tail? If you could look with her eyes, you might see her surrounded with hundreds of figures performing complex dramas, with tragic and comic issues, long conversations, many characters, many ups and downs of fate.","No man has ever had a point of pride that was not injurious to him.","Our age is very cheap and intelligible. Unroof any house, and you shall find it. The well-being consists in having a sufficiency of coffee and toast, with a daily newspaper; a well glazed parlor, with marbles, mirrors and centre-table; and the excitement of a few parties and a few rides in a year.","Every burned book enlightens the world.","We grant no dukedoms to the few,\\nWe hold like rights and shall;\\nEqual on Sunday in the pew,\\nOn Monday in the mall.\\nFor what avail the plough or sail,\\nOr land, or life, if freedom fail?","We fancy men are individuals; so are pumpkins; but every pumpkin in the field goes through every point of pumpkin history.","Nature will not be Buddhist: she resents generalizing, and insults the philosopher in every moment with a million fresh particulars.","Alas for America as I must so often say, the ungirt, the diffuse, the profuse, procumbent, one wide ground juniper, out of which no cedar, no oak will rear up a mast to the clouds! It all runs to leaves, to suckers, to tendrils, to miscellany. The air is loaded with poppy, with imbecility, with dispersion, & sloth.","Proportion is almost impossible to human beings. There is no one who does not exaggerate.","Nature is what you may do. There is much you may not do.","The world exists, as I understand it, to teach the science of liberty.","All good conversation, manners, and action come from a spontaneity which forgets usages and makes the moment great.","Women, more than all, are the element and kingdom of illusion. Being fascinated, they fascinate.","Society is an illusion to the young citizen. It lies before him in rigid repose, with certain names, men, and institutions, rootedlike oak-trees to the centre, round which all arrange themselves the best they can. But the old statesman knows that society is fluid; there are no such roots and centres; but any particle may suddenly become the centre of the movement, and compel the system to gyrate round it, as every man of strong will, like Pisistratus, or Cromwell, does for a time, and every man of truth, like Plato, or Paul, does forever.","Defect in manners is usually the defect of fine perceptions. Elegance comes of no breeding, but of birth.","Every moment instructs, and every object; for wisdom is infused into every form. It has been poured into us as blood; it convulsed us as pain; it slid into us as pleasure; it enveloped us in dull, melancholy days, or in days of cheerful labor; we did not guess its essence until after long time.","There is always room for a man of force and he makes room for many. Society is a troop of thinkers and the best heads among them take the best places.","For the most part, only the light characters travel. Who are you that have no task to keep you at home?","In nature nothing can be given. All things are sold.","It is a greater joy to see the author\'s author, than himself.","A little integrity is better than any career.","A cynic can chill and dishearten with a single word.","It is one of the most beautiful compensations of this life that no person can sincerely try to help another without helping him or herself.  Serve and you shall be served. If you love and serve people, you cannot, by any hiding or stratagem, escape the remuneration.","The secret is the answer to all that has been, all that is, and all that will ever be.","The ornaments of our homes are the friends that visit it","Every individual strives to grow and exclude, to the extremities of the universe, and to impose the law of its being on every other creature.","A day for toil, an hour for sport, but for a friend is life too short.","Each of us sees in others what we carry in our own hearts.","Poverty consist in feeling poor.","Doubt not, O poet, but persist. Say \'It is in me, and shall out.\' Stand there, balked and dumb, stuttering and stammering, hissed and hooted, stand and strive, until at last rage draw out of thee that dream-power which every night shows thee is thine own; a power transcending all limit and privacy, and by virtue of which a man is the conductor of the whole river of electricity.","All science has one aim, namely, to find a theory of nature.","Nature is a language and every new fact one learns is a new word; but it is not a language taken to pieces and dead in the dictionary, but the language put together into a most significant and universal sense. I wish to learn this language - not that I may know a new grammar, but that I may read the great book which is written in that tongue.","Wherever a man comes, there comes revolution. The old is for slaves.","Concentration is the secret of srength.","Self-sacrifice is the real miracle out of which all the reported miracles grow. Do not go where the path may lead, go instead where there is no path and leave a trail. Nothing great was ever achieved without enthusiasm. This time, like all times, is a very good one, if we but know what to do with it. Shallow men believe in luck. Strong men believe in cause and effect. The louder he talked of his honesty, the quicker we counted the silverware.","And truly it demands something godlike in him who cast off the common motives of humanity and ventured to trust himself for a taskmaster.","Of course, money will do after its kind, and will steadily work to unspiritualize and unchurch the people to whom it was bequeathed.","Men should take their knowledge from the Sun, the Moon and the Stars.","We have a great deal more kindness than is ever spoken. (Despite) all the selfishness that chills like east winds the world, the whole human family is bathed with an element of love like a fine ether... The effect of the indulgence of this human affection is a certain cordial exhilaration.","As we are, so we do; and as we do, so is it done to us; we are the builders of our fortunes.","A moody child and wildly wise\\nPursued the game with joyful eyes,\\nWhich chose, like meteors, their way,\\nAnd rived the dark with private ray.","Reality is a sliding door.","Whenever you are sincerely pleased you are nourished.","Friendship should be surrounded with ceremonies and respects, and not crushed into corners.","I am not much an advocate for traveling, and I observe that men run away to other countries because they are not good in their own, and run back to their own because they pass for nothing in the new places. For the most part, only the light characters travel. Who are you that have no task to keep you at home?","Dream delivers us to dream, and there is no end to illusion. Life is like a train of moods like a string of beads, and, as we pass through them, they prove to be many-colored lenses which paint the world their own hue. . . .","Nature is too thin a screen; the glory of the omnipresent God bursts through everywhere","The imitator dooms himself to hopeless mediocrity. The inventor did it because it was natural to him, and so in him it has a charm. In the imitator something else is natural, and he bereaves himself of his own beauty, to come short of another man\'s.","By necessity, by proclivity, and by delight, we all quote. In fact, it is as difficult to appropriate the thoughts of others as it is to invent.","Books are for nothing but to inspire","The desire of gold is not for gold. It is not the love of much wheat, and wool and household stuff. It is the means of freedom and benefit.","The problem of restoring to the world original and eternal beauty is solved by redemption of the soul.","Belief consists in accepting the affirmations of the soul; unbelief in denying them.","The artists must be sacrificed to their art. Like the bees, they must put their lives into the sting they give.","A man will be eloquent if you give him good wine.","Each moment of the year has its own beauty.","I like the silent church before the service begins, better than any preaching.","Men achieve a certain greatness unawares when working to another aim.","I have heard that whoever loves is in no condition old. I have heard that whenever the name of man is spoken, the doctrine of immortality is announced; it cleaves to his constitution. The mode of it baffles our wit, and no whisper comes to us from the other side. But the inference from the working of intellect, hiving knowledge, hiving skill,--at the end of life just ready to be born,--affirms the inspirations of affection and of the moral sentiment.","The secret of ugliness consists not in irregularity, but in being uninteresting.","A friend is a person with whom I may be sincere. Before him I may think aloud. I am arrived at last in the presence of a man so real and equal, that I may drop even those undermost garments of dissimulation, courtesy, and second thought, which men never put off, and may deal with him with the simplicity and wholeness with which one chemical atom meets another.","The sun illuminates only the eye of the man, but shines into the eye and the heart of the child.","The statue is then beautiful when it begins to be incomprehensible, when it is passing out of criticism, and can no longer be defined by compass and measuring-wand, but demands an active imagination to go with it, and to say what it is in the act of doing.","This very certain that each man carries in his eye the exact indication of his rank in the immense scale of men, and we are always learning to read it. A complete man should need no auxiliaries to his personal presence.","The Soul rules over matter. Matter may pass away like a mote in the sunbeam, may be absorbed into the immensity of God, as a mistis absorbed into the heat of the Sun--but the soul is the kingdom of God, the abode of love, of truth, of virtue.","If the stars should appear one night in a thousand years, how would men believe and adore; and preserve for many generations the remembrance of the city of God which had been shown! But every night come out these envoys of beauty, and light the universe with their admonishing smile.","In every work of genius we recognize our own rejected thoughts; they come back to us with a certain alienated majesty.","A man\'s growth is seen in the successive choirs of his friends.","Books are the best of things if well used; if abused, among the worst. They are good for nothing but to inspire. I had better never see a book than be warped by its attraction clean out of my own orbit, and made a satellite instead of a system.","Love is like a hunter, who cares not for the game when once caught, which he may have pursued with the most intense and breathless eagerness. Love is strongest in pursuit; friendship in possession.","To speak truly, few adult persons can see nature. Most persons do not see the sun.","Why should we grope among the dry bones of the past? The sun shines today also.","All science is transcendental or else passes away.","Vivacity, leadership, must be had, and we are not allowed to be nice in choosing. We must fetch the pump with dirty water, if clean cannot be had.","So much of our time is spent in preparation, so much in routine, and so much in retrospect, that the amount of each person\'s genius is confined to a very few hours.","If thou fill thy brain with Boston and New York, with fashion and covetousness, and wilt stimulate thy jaded senses with wine and French coffee, thou shalt find no radiance of wisdom in the lonely waste of the pinewoods.","Universities are of course hostile to geniuses, which, seeing and using ways of their own, discredit the routine: as churches and monasteries persecute youthful saints.","Wisdom is not found with those who dwell at their ease; rather nature, when she adds brain, adds difficulty.","Every man believes he has a greater possibility.","The service a man renders his friend is trivial and selfish, compared with the service he knows his friend stood in readiness to yield him, alike before he had begun to serve his friend, and now also. Compared with that good-will I bear my friend, the benefit it is in my power to render him seems small.","The age of puberty is a crisis in the age of man worth studying. It is the passage from the unconscious to the conscious; from thesleep of passions to their rage.","Each man has his own vocation. The talent is the call. There is one direction in which all space is open to him. He has faculties silently inviting him thither to endless exertion. He is like a ship in the river; he runs against obstructions on every side but one; on that side all obstruction is taken away, and he sweeps serenely over a deepening channel into an infinite sea.","They who talk much of destiny, their birth-star, etc., are in a lower dangerous plane, and invite the evils they fear.","God hid the whole world in thy heart.","Thought is the seed of action; but action is as much its second form as thought is its first.","Whenever a mind is simple and receives an old wisdom, old things pass away,--means, teachers, texts, temples fall; it lives now, and absorbs past and future into present hour. All things are made sacred by relation to it,--one as much as another.","If the king is in the palace, nobody looks at the walls. It is when he is gone, and the house is filled with grooms and gazers, that we turn from the people, to find relief in the majestic men that are suggested by the pictures and the architecture.","We surround ourselves with the true image of ourselves.","The simplest words,--we do not know what they mean except when we love and aspire.","He that writes to himself writes to an eternal public.","Wherever the truth is injured, defend it.","Wherever there is failure, there is some giddiness, some superstition about luck, some step omitted, which, Nature never pardons.","England produces under favorable conditions of ease and culture the finest women in the world. And, as the men are affectionate and true-hearted, the women inspire and refine them.","Few people have any next, they live from hand to mouth without a plan, and are always at the end of their line.","If a man owns land,\\nthe land owns him.","Music is the poor man\'s Parnassus.","Often a certain abdication of prudence and foresight is an element of success.","We live ruins amid ruins.","Let us advance on Chaos and the Dark","To wade in marshes and sea margins is the destiny of certain bird, and they are so accurately made for this that they are imprisoned in those places. Each animal out of its habitat would starve. To the physician, each man, each woman, is an amplification of one organ. A soldier, a locksmith, a bank-clerk, and a dancer could not exchange functions. And thus we are victims of adaptation.","If you would rule the world quietly, you must keep it amused.","A strenuous soul hates cheap success.","I like people who like Plato.","Every calamity is a spur and a valuable hint.","Let the amelioration in our laws of property proceed from the concession of the rich, not from the grasping of the poor. Let us understand that the equitable rule is, that no one should take more than his share, let him be ever so rich.","You must pay for conformity. All goes well as long as you run with conformists. But you, who are honest men in other particulars, know that there is alive somewhere a man whose honesty reaches to this point also, that he shall not kneel to false gods, and, on the day when you meet him, you sink into the class of counterfeits.","Our opinions of the world, are confessions of character.","When nature removes a great man, people explore the horizon for a successor; but none comes, and none will. His class is extinguished with him. In some other and quite different field, the next man will appear.","O Lord! Unhappy is the man whom man can make unhappy.","Work and thou canst escape the reward; whether the work be fine or course, planting corn or writing epics, so only it be honest work, done to thine own approbation, it shall earn a reward to the senses as well as to the thought.","When the spirit is not master of the world, then it is its dupe.","A mind might ponder its thought for an epoch, and not gain so much self-knowledge as the passion of love shall teach in a day.","He who would be a great soul in the future, must be a great soul now.","Put God in your debt. Every stroke shall be repaid. The longer the payment is with-held, the better for you; for compound interest on compound interest is the rate and usage of this exchequer.","The people fancy they hate poetry, and they are all poets and mystics.","Yet some natures are too good to be spoiled by praise, and wherever the vein of thought reaches down into the profound, there is no danger from vanity. Solemn friends will warn them of the danger of the head\'s being turned by the flourish of trumpets, but they can afford to smile.","Every thought is public,\\nEvery nook is wide;\\nThy gossips spread each whisper,\\nAnd the gods from side to side.","The most advanced nations are always those who navigate the most. The power which the sea requires in the sailor makes a man of him very fast, and the change of shores and population clears his head of much nonsense of his wigwam.","The Artist always has the masters in his eyes.","All great men come out of the middle classes.","All high beauty has a moral element in it.","Accept the place the divine providence has found for you, the society of your contemporaries, the connection of events.","Great geniuses have the shortest biographies.","Whom God has put asunder, why should man put together?","America means opportunity, freedom, power.","Yet things are knowable! They are knowable, because, being from one, things correspond. There is a scale: and the correspondence of heaven to earth, of matter to mind, of the part to the whole, is our guide. As there is a science of stars, called astronomy; and science of quantities, called mathematics; a science of qualities, called chemistry; so there is a science of sciences,--I call it Dialectic,--which is the Intellect discriminating the false and the true.","Honor and fortune exist for him who always recognizes the neighborhood of the great, always feels himself in the presence of high causes.","When science is learned in love, and its powers are wielded by love, they will appear the supplements and continuations of the material creation.","He who travels in search of something which he has not got, travels away from himself and grows old even in youth among old things.","Things admit of being used as symbols, because nature is a symbol, in the whole, and in every part.","The world when seen through a little child\'s eyes, greatly resembles paradise. Happiness is doing with a smile what you have to do anyway. This time, like all time, is a very good one if we but know what to do with it.","All that Adam had, all that Caesar could, you have and can do.... Build, therefore, your own world.","If you cannot be free be as free as you can.","Circumstance does not make the man. Circumstance reveals man to himself.","Make yourself necessary to the world, and mankind will give you bread.","It does not hurt weak eyes to look into beautiful eyes never so long.","Genius is the power to labor better and more availably. Deserve thy genius: exalt it.","For all our penny-wisdom, for all our soul-destroying slavery to habit, it is not to be doubted that all men have sublime thoughts; that all men value the few real hours of life; they love to be heard; they love to be caught up into the vision of principles. We mark with light in the memory the few interviews we have had, in the dreary years of routine and of sin, with souls that made our souls wiser; that spoke what we thought; that told us what we knew; that gave us leave to be what we only were.","Truth is the property of no individual but is the treasure of all men.","All sensible people are selfish, and nature is tugging at every contract to make the terms of it fair.","The world is his who has money to go over it.","The victories of character are instant, and victories for all.","The secret of culture is to learn, that a few great points steadily reappear, alike in the poverty of the obscurest farm, and in the miscellany of metropolitan life, and that these few are alone to be regarded,--the escape from all false ties; courage to be what we are; and love what is simple and beautiful; independence and cheerful relation, these are the essentials,--these, and the wish to serve,--to add somewhat to the well-being of men.","The whole world is an omen and a sign. Why look so wistfully in a corner? Man is the Image of God. Why run after a ghost or a dream? The voice of divination resounds everywhere and runs to waste unheard, unregarded, as the mountains echo with the bleatings of cattle.","Man carries the world in his head, the whole astronomy and chemistry suspended in a thought. Because the history of nature is charactered in his brain, therefore he is the prophet and discoverer of her secrets. Every known fact in natural science was divined by the presentiment of somebody, before it was actually verified.","We love force and we care very little how it is exhibited.","Every individual man has a bias which he must obey, and...it is only as he feels and obeys this that he rightly develops and attains his legitimate power in the world. It is his magnetic needle, which points always in one direction to his proper path.... He is never happy nor strong until he finds it, keeps it.","Our first mistake is the belief that the circumstance gives the joy which we give to the circumstance.","The astonishment of life is the absence of any appearances of reconciliation between the theory and the practice of life.","It does not need that a poem should be long. Every word was once a poem.","Nature arms each man with some faculty which enables him to do easily some feat impossible to any other, and thus makes him necessary to society. ... Society can never prosper, but must always be bankrupt, until every man does that which he was created to do.","Conformity is the ape of harmony.","An institution is the lengthened shadow of one man.","There is nothing in history to parallel the influence of Jesus Christ.","Nature is reckless of the individual. When she has points to carry, she carries them.","All conservatives are such from personal defects. They have been effiminated by position of nature, born halt and blind, through luxury of their parents, and can only, like invalids, act on the defensive.","We pass for what we are.  Character teaches above our wills.  Men imagine that they communicate thier virtue or vice by overt actions, and do not see that virtue or vice emit a breath ever moment....One tendency unites them all.  The voyage of the best ship is a zsig zag line of a hundred tacks.  See the line from a sufficent distance and it straightens itslef to the average tendency.","Eloquence shows the power and possibility of man. There is one of whom we took no note, but on a certain occasion it appears that he has a secret virtue never suspected - that he can paint what has occurred and what must occur, with such clearness to a company, as if they saw it done before their eyes. By leading their thought he leads their will, and can make them do gladly what an hour ago they would not believe that they could be led to do at all.","We do not know today whether we are busy or idle. In times when we thought ourselves indolent, we have afterwards discovered that much was accomplished, and much was begun in us.","Good bye, proud world! I\'m going home; Thou art not my friend, and I\'m not thine","Teach me your mood, O patient stars.

They who lived with them found life glad and nutritious. Life is sweet and tolerable only in our belief in such society.","Great thoughts ensure musical expression.","The Oversoul is before Time, and Time, Father of all else, is one of his children.","He in whom the love of truth predominates . . . submits to the inconvenience of suspense and imperfect opinion; but he is a candidate for truth . . . and respects the highest law of his being.","A cheerful intelligent face is the end of culture, and success enough. For it indicates the purpose of Nature and wisdom attained.","I pay the schoolmaster, but \'tis the schoolboys that educate my son.","The near explains the far. The drop is a small ocean. A man is related to all nature. This perception of the worth of the vulgar is fruitful in discoveries. Goethe, in this very thing the most modern of the moderns, has shown us, as none ever did, the genius of the ancients.","A philosopher must be more than a philosopher.","Talent finds its models, methods, and ends in society, exists for exhibition, and goes to the soul only for power to work. Genius is its own end, and draws its means and the style of its architecture from within.","Living without Laughing isn\'t living. Be silly. Be honest. Be Kind.","\'Tis a good rule in every journey to provide some piece of liberal study to rescue the hours which bad weather, bad company, and taverns steal from the best economist.","What we love that we have, but by desire we bereave ourselves of the love.","The world is the perennial miracle which the soul worketh.","Don\'t be a cynic and disconsolate preacher.

There is one direction in which all space is open to him.","An action is the perfection and publication of thought.","Nobody trips over mountains. It is the small pebble that causes you to stumble. Pass all the pebbles in your path and you will find you have crossed the mountain. The mind does not create what it perceives, anymore than the eye creates the rose.","Only by obedience to his genius; only by the freest activity in the way constitutional to him, does an angel seem to arise beforea man, and lead him by the hand out of all the wards of the prison.","It seems as if nature, in regarding the geologic night behind her, when, in five or six millenniums, she had turned out five or six men, as Homer, Phidias, Menu, and Columbus, was no wise discontented with the result. These samples attested the virtue of the tree.","There was never a man born so wise or good, but one or more companions came into the world with him, who delight in his faculty, and report it. I cannot see without awe, that no man thinks alone and no man acts alone, but the divine assessors who came up with him into life,--now under one disguise, now under another,--like a police in citizen\'s clothes, walk with him, step for step, through all kingdoms of time.","The world we live in is but thickened light.","There can be no excess to love, none to knowledge, none to beauty.","Great men are more distinguished by range and extent than by originality.","The Buddhist, who thanks no man, who says \\"Do not flatter your benefactors,\\" but who, in his conviction that every good deed can by no possibility escape its reward, will not deceive the benefactor by pretending that he has done more than he should, is a Transcendentalist.","When a dog is chasing after you, whistle for him.","If you maintain a dead church, contribute to a dead Bible-society, vote with a great party either for the government or against it, spread your table like base housekeepers, - under all these screens I have diffuculty to detect the precise man you are: and of course so much force is withdrawn from your proper life.  But do your work and I shall know you.  Do your work, and you shall reinforce yourself.  A man must consider what a blind-man\'s bluff is this game of conformity.  If I know your sect I anticipate your argument.","Skepticism? Yes, but a saint is a skeptic once in twenty-four hours.","The genius is a genius by the first look he casts on any object. Is his eye creative? Does he not rest in angles and colors, but beholds the design,--he will presently undervalue the actual object.","America is not civil, whilst Africa is barbarous.","Earth\'s a howling wilderness,\\nTruculent with fraud and force.","A walk in the woods is only an exalted dream.","I am become a transparent eyeball.","Fate is nothing but the deeds committed in a prior state of existence.","He who is in love is wise and is becoming wiser, sees newly every time he looks at the object beloved, drawing from it with his eyes and his mind those virtues which it possesses.","When we are young, we spend much time and pains in filling our note-books with all definitions of Religion, Love, Poetry, Politics, Art, in the hope that, in the course of a few years, we shall have condensed into our encyclopaedia the net value of all the theories at which the world has yet arrived. But year after year our tables get no completeness, and at last we discover that our curve is a parabola, whose arcs will never meet.","The greatest man in history was the poorest.","One man\'s justice is another\'s injustice; one man\'s beauty another\'s ugliness; one man\'s wisdom anpther\'s folly.","Coal is a portable climate. It carries the heat of the tropics to Labrador and the polar circle; and it is the means of transporting itself whithersoever it is wanted. Watt and Stephenson whispered in the ear of mankind their secret, that a half-ounce of coal will draw two tons a mile, and coal carries coal, by rail and by boat, to make Canada as warm as Calcutta, and with its comfort brings its industrial power.","The disease with which the human mind now labors is want of faith","Is it not better to intimate our astonishment as we pass through this world if it be only for a moment ere we are swallowed up in the yeast of the abyss? I will lift up my hands and say Kosmos.","We cannot describe the natural history of the soul, but we know that it is divine. All things are known to the soul. It is not to be surprised by any communication. Nothing can be greater than it, let those fear and those fawn who will. The soul is in her native realm; and it is wider than space, older than time, wide as hope, rich as love. Pusillanimity and fear she refuses with a beautiful scorn; they are not for her who putteth on her coronation robes, and goes out through universal love to universal power.","Every evil to which we do not succumb is a benefactor.","Shakespeare possesses the power of subordinating nature for the purposes of expression, beyond all poets. His imperial muse tosses the creation like a bauble from hand to hand, and uses it to embody any caprice of thought that is uppermost in his mind. The remotest spaces of nature are visited, and the farthest sundered things are brought together, by subtle spiritual connection. We are made aware that magnitude of material things is relative, and all objects shrink and expand to serve the passion of the poet.","The only gift is a portion of thyself . . . the poet brings his poem; the shepherd his lamb. . . .","On bravely through the sunshine and the showers!\\nTime hath his work to do, and we have ours.","I may say it of our preposterous use of books,--He knew not what to do, and so he read.","The only true gifts are a portion of yourself.","A child convinced against his will is of the same opinion still.\\nThe reward for a thing well done, is to have done it.","In the sublimest flights of the soul, rectitude is never surmounted, love is never outgrown.","Our spontaneous action is always the best. You cannot, with your best deliberation and heed, come so close to any question as your spontaneous glance shall bring you.","Worst, when this sensualism intrudes into the education of young women, and withers the hope and affection of human nature, by teaching that marriage signifies nothing but a housewife\'s thrift, and that woman\'s life has no other aim.","But the wise know that foolish legislation is a rope of sand, which perishes in the twisting; that the State must follow, and notlead the character and progress of the citizen; the strongest usurper is quickly got rid of; and they only who build on Ideas, build for eternity; and that the form of government which prevails, is the expression of what cultivation exists in the population which permits it.","Under the dominion of an idea, which possesses the minds of multitudes, as civil freedom, or the religious sentiment, the power ofpersons are no longer subjects of calculation. A nation of men unanimously bent on freedom, or conquest, can easily confound the arithmetic of statists, and achieve extravagant actions, out of all proportion to their means; as, the Greeks, the Saracens, the Swiss, the Americans, and the French have done.","Every thing admonishes us how needlessly long life is.","The forest waves, the morning breaks,\\nThe pastures sleep, ripple the lakes,\\nLeaves twinkle, flowers like persons be\\nAnd life pulsates in rock or tree.","We will walk on our own feet; we will work with our own hands; we will speak our own minds... A nation of men will for the first time exist, because each believes himself inspired by the Divine Soul which also inspires all men.","Virtue runs before the muse,\\nand defies her skill;\\nshe is rapt and doth refuse\\nto wait a painter\'s will.","The eye is the best of artists.","A work of art is an abstract or epitome of the world. It is the result or expression of nature, in miniature. For, although the works of nature are innumerable and all different, the result or the expression of them all is similar and single.","Art, in the artist, is proportion, or, a habitual respect to the whole by an eye loving beauty in details. And the wonder and charm of it is the sanity in insanity which it denotes.","Perpetual modernness is the measure of merit, in every work of art; since the author of it was not misled by anything short- livedor local, but abode by real and abiding traits.","There is no architect\\nCan build as the Muse can;\\nShe is skilful to select\\nMaterials for her plan.","In the Greek cities, it was reckoned profane, that any person should pretend a property in a work of art, which belonged to all who could behold it.","How often we must remember the art of the surgeon, which, in replacing the broken bone, contents itself with releasing the parts from false position; they fly into place by the action of the muscles. On this art of nature all our arts rely.","We know that madness belongs to love,--what power to paint a vile object in hues of heaven.","Our prayers are prophets.","As soon as the man is at one with God, he will not beg. He will then see prayer in all action.","Prayer that craves a particular commodity, anything less than all good, is vicious.","In the moment when you make the least petition to God, though it be but a silent wish that he may approve you, or add one moment to your life,--do you not, in the very act, necessarily exclude all other beings from your thought? In that act, the soul stands alone with God, and Jesus is no more present to your mind than your brother or your child.","Women stand related to beautiful nature around us, and the enamoured youth mixes their form with moon and stars, with woods and waters, and the pomp of summer. They heal us of awkwardness by their words and looks. We observe their intellectual influence on the most serious student. They refine and clear his mind: teach him to put a pleasing method into what is dry and difficult.","The saint and poet seek privacy to ends the most public and universal: and it is the secret of culture, to interest the man more in his public, than in his private quality.","Keep the town for occasions, but the habits should be formed in retirement.","The solitary knows the essence of the thought, the scholar in society only its fair face.","But your isolation must not be mechanical, but spiritual, that is, must be elevation.","My doom and my strength is to be solitary.","Solitude is impractical, and society fatal. We must keep our head in the one and our hands in the other. The conditions are met, if we keep our independence, yet do not lose our sympathy.","A more secret, sweet, and overpowering beauty appears to man when his heart and mind open to the sentiment of virtue. Then he is instructed in what is set above him. He learns that his being is without bound; that to the good, to the perfect, he is born, low as he now lies in evil and weakness.","The superstition respecting power and office is going to the ground. The stream of human affairs flows its own way, and is very little affected by the activity of legislators. What great masses of men wish done, will be done; and they do not wish it for a freak, but because it is their state and natural end.","Those who have ruled human destinies, like planets, for thousands of years, were not handsome men.","Fashion understands itself; good-breeding and personal superiority of whatever country readily fraternize with those of every other. The chiefs of savage tribes have distinguished themselves in London and Paris, by the purity of their tournure.","If the aristocrat is only valid in fashionable circles, and not with truckmen, he will never be a leader in fashion; and if the man of the people cannot speak on equal terms with the gentleman, so that the gentleman shall perceive that he is already really of his own order, he is not to be feared.","When a natural king becomes a titular king, every body is pleased and satisfied.","History is full, down to this day, of the imbecility of kings and governors. They are a class of persons much to be pitied, for they know not what they should do.","In every company, there is not only the active and passive sex, but, in both men and women, a deeper and more important sex of mind, namely, the inventive or creative class of both men and women, and the uninventive or accepting class.","Who shall set a limit to the influence of a human being? There are men, who, by their sympathetic attractions, carry nations withthem, and lead the activity of the human race. And if there be such a tie, that, wherever the mind of man goes, nature will accompany him, perhaps there are men whose magnetisms are of that force to draw material and elemental powers, and, where they appear, immense instrumentalities organize around them.","Where is he who seeing a thousand men useless and unhappy, and making the whole region forlorn by their inaction, and conscious himself of possessing the faculty they want, does not hear his call to go and be their king?","I believe it is the conviction of the purest men, that the net amount of man and man does not much vary. Each is incomparably superior to his companion in some faculty. His want of skill in other directions, has added to his fitness for his own work.","Flowers so strictly belong to youth, that we adult men soon come to feel, that their beautiful generations concern not us: we havehad our day; now let the children have theirs. The flowers jilt us, and we are old bachelors with our ridiculous tenderness.","Man moves in all modes, by legs of horses, by wings of winds, by steam, by gas of balloon, by electricity, and stands on tiptoe threatening to hunt the eagle in his own element.","Machinery is aggressive. The weaver becomes a web, the machinist a machine. If you do not use the tools, they use you. All tools are in one sense edge-tools, and dangerous.","Skepticism is unbelief in cause and effect. A man does not see, that, as he eats, so he thinks: as he deals, so he is, and so he appears; he does not see that his son is the son of his thoughts and of his actions; that fortunes are not exceptions but fruits; that relation and connection are not somewhere and sometimes, but everywhere and always; no miscellany, no exemption, no anomaly,--but method, and an even web; and what comes out, that was put in.","Instead of feeling a poverty when we encounter a great man, let us treat the new comer like a travelling geologist, who passes through our estate, and shows us good slate, or limestone, or anthracite, in our brush pasture.","Sport is the bloom and glow of a perfect health. The great will not condescend to take anything seriously; all must be as gay as the song of a canary, though it were the building of cities, or the eradication of old and foolish churches and nations, which have cumbered the earth long thousands of years.","The affirmative class monopolize the homage of mankind. They originate and execute all the great feats. What a force was coiled upin the skull of Napoleon!","I count him a great man who inhabits a higher sphere of thought, into which other men rise with labor and difficulty; he has but to open his eyes to see things in a true light, and in large relations; whilst they must make painful corrections, and keep a vigilant eye on many sources of error.","In old persons, when thus fully expressed, we often observe a fair, plump, perennial waxen complexion, which indicates that all the ferment of earlier days has subsided into serenity of thought and behavior.","The merit of those who fill a space in the world\'s history, who are borne forward, as it were, by the weight of thousands whom they lead, shed a perfume less sweet than do the sacrifices of private virtue.","The sentiment of virtue is a reverence and delight in the presence of certain divine laws. It perceives that this homely game of life we play, covers, under what seem foolish details, principles that astonish.","The consciousness in each man is a sliding scale, which identifies him now with the First Cause, and now with the flesh of his body; life above life, in infinite degrees.","Logic is the procession or proportionate unfolding of the intuition; but its virtue is as silent method; the moment it would appear as propositions, and have a separate value, it is worthless.","Our reliance on the physician is a kind of despair of ourselves.","The secret of success in education is respecting the students.","The only method to possess a buddy is always to be one.","Great believers are always reckoned infidels, impracticable, fantastic, atheistic, and really men of no account. The spiritualist finds himself driven to express his faith by a series of skepticisms.","The religion which is to guide and fulfill the present and coming ages, whatever else it be, must be intellectual. The scientific mind must have a faith which is science.","Great conversation ... requires an absolute running of two souls into one.","It is commonly said by farmers, that a good pear or apple costs no more time or pains to rear, than a poor one; so I would have no work of art, no speech, or action, or thought, or friend, but the best.","Steam was till the other day the devil which we dreaded. Every pot made by any human potter or brazier had a hole in its cover, to let off the enemy, lest he should lift pot and roof and carry the house away.","A man should have a farm or a mechanical craft for his culture. We must have a basis for our higher accomplishments, our delicate entertainments of poetry and philosophy, in the work of our hands.","A scholar is a candle which the love and desire of all men will light.","Never mind the ridicule, never mind the defeat: up again, old heart!-it seems to say,-there is victory yet for all justice; and the true romance which the world exists to realize, will be the transformation of genius into practical power.","The height, the deity of man is to be self-sustained, to need no gift, no foreign force. Society is good when it does not violate me, but best when it is likest to solitude.","Our country, customs, laws, our ambitions, and our notions of fit and fair-all these we never made; we found them ready-made; we but quote from them. What would remain to me if this art of appropriation were derogatory to genius? Every one of my writings has been furnished to me by a thousand different persons, a thousand things; wise and foolish have brought me, without suspecting it, the offering of their thoughts, faculties, and experience. My work is an aggregation of beings taken from the whole of nature. It bears the name of Goethe.","What you set your heart upon, surely shall be yours.","No reason can be asked or given why the soul seeks beauty. Beauty, in its largest and profoundest sense, is one expression for the universe. God is the all-fair. Truth, and goodness, and beauty, are but different faces of the same All.\uf10e","Will is the measure of power. To a great genius there must be a great will. If the thought is not a lamp to the will, does not proceed to an act, the wise are imbecile. He alone is strong and happy who has a will. The rest are herds. He uses; they are used. He is of the Maker; they are of the Made. Will is always miraculous, being the presence of God to men. When it appears in a man he is a hero, and all metaphysics are at fault.","It really is considered one of the blessings of previous mates which you could manage being silly with them.","Our prejudices are our robbers, they rob us valuable things in life. People only see what they are prepared to see.","Profound sincerity is the only basis of talent as of character.","We are as much strangers in nature, as we are aliens from God. We do not understand the notes of birds. The fox and the deer run away from us; the bear and tiger rend us. We do not know the uses of more than a few plants, as corn and the apple, the potato and the vine. Is not the landscape, every glimpse of which hath a grandeur, a face of him?","The amount of a man\'s wealth consists in the number of things he can do without.","Make youself necessary to someone.","I think no virtue goes with size.","Every man has a choice between love of truth and love of repose. Love of repose brings him a solid reputation and peaceful life; love of truth keeps him in suspense. A man who loves truth respects the highest law of his being.","I like my boy with his endless sweet soliloquies and iterations and his utter inability to conceive why I should not leave all my nonsense, business, and writing and come to tie up his toy horse, as if there was or could be any end to nature beyond his horse. And he is wiser than we when [he] threatens his whole threat \\"I will not love you.\\"","But we need not fear that we can lose any thing by the progress of the soul. The soul may be trusted to the end.","A great teacher makes hard things easy.","What a man does, that he has. What has he to do with hope or fear? In himself is his might. Let him regard no good as solid but that which is in his nature, and which must grow out of him as long as he exists. The goods of fortune may come and go like summer leaves; let him scatter them on every wind as the momentary signs of his infinite productiveness.","Under every deep a lower deep opens.","First be a good animal.","The power of love, as the basis of a State, has never been tried.","Line in Nature is not found; Unit and Universe are round.","The astronomers said, \'Give us matter and a little motion and we will construct the universe. It is not enough that we should have matter, we must also have a single impulse, one shove to launch the mass and generate the harmony of the centrifugal and centripetal forces.\' ... There is no end to the consequences of the act. That famous aboriginal push propagates itself through all the balls of the system, and through every atom of every ball.","Perpetual modernism is the measure of merit in every work of art.","The True Artist has the planet for his pedestal; the adventurer, after years of strife, has nothing broader than his shoes.","Magic and all that is ascribed to it is a deep presentiment of the powers of science.","Condense some daily experience into a glowing symbol and an audience is electrified.","Next to the originator of a good sentence is the first quoter of it. Many will read the book before one thinks of quoting a passage. As soon as he has done this, that line will be quoted east and west.","Be a little careful about your library. Do you foresee what you will do with it? Very little to be sure. But the real question is what it will do with you? You will come here and get books that will open your eyes, and your ears, and your curiosity, and turn you inside out or outside in.","We are the prisoners of ideas.","Two may talk and one may hear, but three cannot take part in a conversation of the most sincere and searching sort.","New arts destroy the old.","No sensible person ever made an apology.","New York is a sucked orange.","Thefts never enrich; alms never impoverish; murder will speak out of stone walls. The least admixture of a lie-for example, the taint of vanity, the least attempt to make a good impression, a favorable appearance-will instantly vitiate the effect.","What is the imagination? Only an arm or weapon of the interior energy; only the precursor of the reason.","The secret of success in society is a certain heartiness and sympathy.","The city is recruited from the country.","The essence of all jokes, of all comedy, seems to be an honest or well intended halfness; a non performance of that which is pretended to be performed, at the same time that one is giving loud pledges of performance. The balking of the intellect, is comedy and it announces itself in the pleasant spasms we call laughter.","A low self-love in the parent desires that his child should repeat his character and fortune.","Harmony of aim, not identity of conclusion, is the secret of sympathetic life.","We are reformers in the spring and summer, but in autumn we stand by the old. Reformers in the morning, and conservers at night.","Too busy with the crowded hour to fear to live or die.","The effects of opposition are wonderful. There are men who rise refreshed on hearing of a threat, men to whom a crisis, which intimidates and paralyzes the majority, comes as graceful and beloved as a bride!","If I cannot brag of knowing something, then I brag of not knowing it; at any rate, brag.","Every man believes that he has greater possibilities.","Wit makes its own welcome, and levels all distinctions.","The condition which high friendship demands is ability to do without it.","In dealing with the State, we ought to remember that its institutions are not aboriginal, though they existed before we were born; that they are not superior to the citizen; that every one of them was once the act of a single man; every law and usage was a man\'s expedient to meet a particular case; that they all are imitable, all alterable; we may make as good; we may make better.","The dice of God are always loaded.","Shallow men believe in luck, believe in circumstances: it was somebody\'s name, or he happened to be there at right time, or it was so then, and another day it would have been otherwise. Strong men believe in cause and effect.","All stealing is comparative. If you come to absolutes, pray who does not steal.","Want is a growing giant whom the coat of have was never large enough to cover.","The believing we do something when we do nothing is the first illusion of tobacco.","No matter how much faculty of idle seeing a man has, the step from knowing to doing is rarely taken.","Men cease to interest us when we find their limitations","We put our love where we have put our labor.","I have come to believe that the whole world is an enigma, a harmless enigma that is made terrible by our own mad attempt to interpret it as though it had an underlying truth. If two or three persons should come with a high spiritual aim and with great powers, the world would fall into their hands like a ripe peach.","The eye of prudence may never shut.","Our desires presage the capacities within us; they are harbingers of what we shall be able to accomplish. What we can do and want to do is projected in our imagination, quite outside ourselves, and into the future. We are attracted to what is already ours in secret. Thus passionate anticipation transforms what is indeed possible into dreamt-for reality.","All infractions of love and equity in our social relations are speedily punished-by fear...be honest with a man and you have no fear. Try to deceive and the relationship deteriorates.","We stand against fate, as children stand up against the wall in their father\'s house, and notch their height from year to year.  But when the boy grows to a man, and is master of the house, he pulls down that wall and builds it new and bigger.","The reason why all men honor love is because it looks up, and not down; aspires and not despairs.","Never self-possessed, or prudent, love is all abandonment.","In failing circumstances no one can be relied on to keep their integrity.","A complete man should need no auxiliaries to his personal presence.","The man who renounces himself, comes to himself.","Why should we not have a first-hand and immediate experience of God?","Every man should let out all the length of all the reigns; should find or make a frank and healthy expression of what force and meaning is in him.","For it is only the finite that has wrought and suffered; the infinite lies stretched in smiling repose.","Pride ruined the angels.","Who leaves the pine-tree, leaves his friend, Unnerves his strength, invites his end.","Where there is no vision a people perish.","You cannot kindle a fire in any other heart until it is burning in your own.","The fatal trait of the times is the divorce between religion and morality.","He that loveth maketh his own the grandeur he loves","The shot heard round the world.","The soul is the perceiver and revealer of truth. We know truth when we see it, let skeptic and scoffer say what they choose ... We distinguish the announcements of the soul, its manifestations of its own nature, by the term Revelation. These are always attended by the emotion of the sublime. For this communication is an influx of the Divine mind into our mind. It is an ebb of the individual rivulet before the flowing surges of the sea of life. Every distinct apprehension of this central commandment agitates men with awe and delight.","We lie in the lap of immense intelligence, which makes us receivers of its truth and organ of its activity. When we discern justice, when we discern truth, we do nothing by ourselves, but allow a passage to its beams. If we ask whence this comes, if we seek to pry into the soul that causes, all philosophy is at fault. Its presence or its absence is all we can affirm.","Man is priest, and scholar, and statesman, and producer, and soldier. In the divided or social state these functions are parcelled out to individuals, each of whom aims to do his stint of the joint work, whilst each other performs his.","I admire answers to which no answers can be made.","I like to be beholden to the great metropolitan English speech, the sea which receives tributaries from every region under heaven.","Skepticism is unbelief in cause and effect.","Wise men are not wise at all hours, and will speak five times from their taste or their humor, to once from their reason.","Eloquence is the power to translate a truth into language perfectly intelligible to the person to whom you speak.","Language is a city, to the building of which every human being brought a stone; yet he is no more to be credited with the grand result than the acaleph which adds a cell to the coral reef which is the basis of the continent.","We infer the spirit of the nation in great measure from the language, which is a sort of monument, to which each forcible individual in a course of many hundred years has contributed a stone.","The adventitious beauty of poetry may be felt in the greater delight with a verse given in a happy quotation than in the poem.","Infancy conforms to nobody;\\nall conform to it.","The heroic cannot be the common,\\nnor the common the heroic.","The French woman says,\\n\'I am a woman and a Parisienne,\\nand nothing foreign to me\\nappears altogether human.\'","Poetry teaches the enormous force of a few words, and, in proportion to the inspiration, checks loquacity.","The imitator dooms himself to hopeless mediocrity.","Every friend whom not thy fantastic will but the great and tender heart in thee craveth, shall lock thee in his embrace. And this because the heart in thee is the heart of all; not a valve, not a wall, not an intersection is there anywhere in nature, but one blood rolls uninterruptedly in endless circulation through all men, as the water of the globe is all one sea, and, truly seen, its tide is one.","When half-gods go\\n The gods arrive.","And so the reliance on Property, including the reliance on governments which protect it, is the want of self-reliance.","Crossing a bare common, in snow puddles at twilight, under a clouded sky, without having in my thoughts any occurrence of special good fortune, I have enjoyed perfect exhilaration. I am glad to the brink of fear.","For it is not metres, but a metre-making argument that makes a poem, - a thought so passionate and alive that like the spirit of a plant or an animal it has an architecture of its own, and adorns nature with a new thing.","Man is a stream whose source is hidden. Our being is descending into us from we know not whence.","The poise of a plant, the bended tree recovering itself from the strong wind, the vital resources of every vegetable and animal, are also demonstrations of the self-sufficing, and therefore self-relying soul. All history from its highest to its trivial passages is the various record of this power.","I read the other day some verses written by an eminent painter which were original and not conventional. The soul always hears an admonition in such lines, let the subject be what it may. The sentiment they instil is of more value than any thought they may contain. To believe your own thought, to believe that what is true for you in your private heart is true for all men, - that is genius.","The corruption of man is followed by the corruption of language.","Self Esteem::\\"It is very easy in the world to live by the opinion of the world. It is very easy in solitude to be self-centered. But the finished man is he who in the midst of the crowd keeps with perfect sweetness the independence of solitude. I knew a man of simple habits and earnest character who never put out his hands nor opened his lips to court the public, and having survived several rotten reputations of younger men, honor came at last and sat down with him upon his private bench from which he had never stirred.\\"","In private places, among sordid objects, an act of truth or heroism seems at once to draw to itself the sky as its temple, the sun as its cradle. Nature stretches out her arms to embrace man, only let his thoughts be of equal greatness.","By virtue of this science the poet is the Namer, or Language-maker, naming things sometimes after their appearance, sometimes after their essence, and giving to every one its own name and not another\'s, thereby rejoicing the intellect, which delights in detachment or boundary.","If we meet no gods,  it is because we harbor none.","Let not the emphasis of hospitality lie in bed and board; but let truth and love and honor and courtesy flow in all thy deeds.","Genius is always sufficiently the enemy of genius by over influence. The literature of every nation bear me witness. The English dramatic poets have Shakspearized now for two hundred years.","No power of genius has ever yet had the smallest success in explaining existence. The perfect enigma remains.","What is originality? It is being one\'s self, and reporting accurately what we see and are.","I suppose every old scholar has had the experience of reading something in a book which was significant to him, but which he could never find again. Sure he is that he read it there, but no one else ever read it, nor can he find it again, though he buy the book and ransack every page.","Cultivate an attitude of gratitude, of giving and forgiving. Nothing can bring you peace but yourself.","The tempered light of the woods is like a perpetual morning.","I like sayers of no better than I like sayers of yes.","Power is the first good.","The power of a man increases steadily by continuance in one direction. He becomes acquainted with the resistances and with his own tools; increases his skill and strength and learns the favorable moments and favorable accidents.","This book of Montaigne the world has endorsed by translating it into all tongues.","God hides things by putting them near us.","The land is the appointed remedy for whatever is false and fantastic in our culture...food for our mind, as well as our body.","When I walk up the piazza of Santa Croce I feel as if it were not a Florentine nor an European church but a church built by and for the human race.","Every mind has a new compass, a new direction of its own, differencing its genius and aim from every other mind.--We call this specialty the bias of each individual. And none of us will ever accomplish anything excellent or commanding except when he listens to this whisper which is heard by him alone.","Insist on your life, never imitate... do that which is assigned to you, and you cannot hope too much or dare too much.","I am a willow of the wilderness, \\n Loving the wind that bent me.","I am Defeated all the time, yet to Victory I am born.","The mind does not create what it perceives, any more than the eye creates the rose.","Only that mind draws me which I cannot read.","A man\'s style is his mind\'s voice. Wooden minds, wooden voices.","The squirrel hoards nuts and the bee gathers honey, without knowing what they do, and they are thus provided for without selfishness or disgrace.","This knot of nature is so well tied that nobody was ever cunning enough to find the two ends.","Murder in the murderer is no such ruinous thought as poets and romancers will have it; it does not unsettle him, or fright him from his ordinary notice of trifles; it is an act quite easy to be contemplated.","Coal lay in ledges under the ground since the Flood, until a laborer with pick and windlass brings it to the surface. We may well call it black diamonds. Every basket is power and civilization. For coal is a portable climate.","The less a man thinks or knows about his virtues, the better we like him.","They have seen but half the universe who never have been shown the house of pain.","Excite the soul, and the weather and the town and your condition in the world all disappear; the world itself loses its solidity, nothing remains but the soul and the Divine Presence in which it lives.","He presents me with what is always an acceptable gift who brings me news of a great thought before unknown. He enriches me without impoverishing himself.","The gates of thought, - how slow and late they discover themselves! Yet when they appear, we see that they were always there, always open.","Not from a vain or shallow thought His awful Jove young Phidias brought.","He is great who confers the most benefits.","Every advantage has its tax.","We are ashamed of our thoughts and often see them brought forth by others.","Is the acorn better than the oak which is its fullness and completion?","It makes a great difference in the force of a sentence, whether a man be behind it or no.","Do not speak of God much. After a very little conversation on the highest nature, thought deserts us and we run into formalism.","God is our name for the last generalization to which we can arrive.","I am a part and parcel of God.","Let him be great, and love shall follow him.","Genius seems to consist merely in trueness of sight, in using such words as show that the man was an eye-witness, and not a repeater of what was told.","The young man reveres men of genius, because, to speak truly, they are more himself than he is.","Good nature is stronger than tomahawks.","The hero is suffered to be himself.","There is no history; only biography.","In a tavern everybody puts on airs except the landlord.","How much finer things are in composition than alone.","Persons are fine things, but they cost so much! for thee I must pay me.","Every roof is agreeable to the eye, until it is lifted; then we find tragedy and moaning women, and hard-eyed husbands.","Let a man behave in his own house as a guest.","Heaven is large, and affords space for all modes of love and fortitude.","Overhead the sanctities of the stars shine forever-more... pouring satire on the pompous business of the day which they close, and making the generations of men show slight and evanescent.","The reason of idleness and of crime is the deferring of our hopes.","Happy the man who never puts on a face, but receives every visitor with that countenance he has on.","We do not make a world of our own, but fall into institutions already made, and have to accommodate ourselves to them to be useful at all.","When we are exalted by ideas, we do not owe this to Plato, but to the idea, to which also Plato was debtor.","No society can ever be so large as one man.","The riddle of the age has for each a private solution.","We wake from one dream into another dream.","A nation, like a tree, does not thrive well till it is engraffed with a foreign stock.","When it comes to divide an estate, the politest men quarrel.","Genial manners are good, and power of accommodation to any circumstance, but the high prize of life, the crowning fortune of a man is to be born with a bias to some pursuit, which finds him in employment and happiness, -- whether it be to make baskets, or broadswords, or canals, or statutes, or songs. I doubt not this was the meaning of Socrates, when he pronounced artists the only truly wise, as being actually, not apparently so.","Tell them dear, that if eyes were made for seeing,\\nThen beauty is its own excuse for being:\\nWhy thou wert there, O rival of the rose!\\nI never sought to ask, I never knew:\\nBut, in my simple ignorance suppose\\nThe selfsame power that brought me there brought you.","The miracles of genius always rest on profound convictions which refuse to be analyzed.","Far or forgot to me is near;\\nShadow and sunlight are the same;\\nThe vanished gods to me appear;\\nAnd one to me are shame and fame.They reckon ill who leave me out;\\nWhen me they fly, I am the wings;\\nI am the doubter and the doubt,\\nAnd I the hymn the Brahmin sings.","The results of life are uncalculated and uncalculable. The years teach much which the days never know. The persons who compose our company, converse, and come and go, and design and execute many things, and somewhat comes of it all, but an unlooked for result. The individual is always mistaken. He designed many things, and drew in other persons as coadjutors, quarrelled with some or all, blundered much, and something is done; all are a little advanced, but the individual is always mistaken. It turns out somewhat new, and very unlike what he promised himself.","O friend, my bosom said,\\nThrough thee alone the sky is arched.\\nThrough thee the rose is red;\\nAll things through thee take nobler form,\\nAnd look beyond the earth,\\nThe mill-round of our fate appears\\nA sun-path in thy worth.\\nMe too thy nobleness has taught\\nTo master my despair;\\nThe fountains of my hidden life\\nAre through thy friendship fair.","A man cannot free himself by any self-denying ordinances, neither by water nor potatoes, nor by violent possibilities, by refusing to swear, refusing to pay taxes, by going to jail, or by taking another man\'s crops or squatting on his land. By none of these ways can he free himself; no, nor by paying his debts with money; only by obedience to his own genius.","Though thou loved her as thyself,\\nAs a self of purer clay,\\nTho\' her parting dims the day,\\nStealing grace from all alive,\\nHeartily know,\\nWhen half-gods go,\\nThe gods arrive.","Five minutes of today are worth as much to me, as five minutes in the next millennium.\\n Let us be poised, and wise, and our own, today.","A man cannot speak but he judges himself.  With his will or against his will he draws his portrait to the eye of his companions by every word.  Every opinion reacts on him who utters it.  It is a threadball thrown at a mark, but the other end remains on the thrower","What terrible questions we are learning to ask! The former men believed in magic, by which temples, cities, and men were swallowed up, and all trace of them gone. We are coming on the secret of a magic which sweeps out of men\'s minds all vestige of theism and beliefs which they and their fathers held and were framed upon.","The machine unmakes the man. Now that the machine is so perfect, the engineer is nobody.","The horseman serves the horse, The neat-herd serves the neat, The merchant serves the purse, The eater serves his meat; \'Tis the day of the chattel, Web to weave, and corn to grind, Things are in the saddle, And ride mankind.","I DO not count the hours I spend In wandering by the sea; The forest is my loyal friend, Like God it useth me.","We are impressed and even daunted by the immense Universe to be explored. \\"What we know is a point to what we do not know.\\"","[on Thoreau:] For not a particle of respect had he to the opinions of any man or body of men, but homage solely to truth itself.","The craft of the merchant is this bringing a thing where it abounds to where it is costly.","The regular course of studies, the years of academical and professional education, have not yielded me better facts than some idle books under the bench at the Latin School.","With consistency a great soul has simply nothing to do. He may as well concern himself with his shadow on the wall.","Though I am weak, yet God, when prayed, Cannot withhold his conquering aid.","A man makes inferiors his superiors by heat; self control is the rule. Anger is an uncontrollable feeling that betrays what you are when you are not yourself. Anger is that powerful internal force that blows out the light of reason. Know this to be the enemy: it is anger, born of desire.","If I know your sect, I anticipate your argument","The solar system has no anxiety about its reputation.","The conscious utterance of thought, by speech or action, to any end, is art.","Beauty brings its own fancy price, for all that a man hath will he give for his love.","There is no calamity that right words will not begin to redress","Jesus Christ belonged to the true race of the prophets. He saw with an open eye the mystery of the soul. . Alone in all history he estimated the greatness of man.","A man of good sense but of little faith, whose compassion seemed to lead him to church as often as he went there, said to me; \'that he liked to have concerts, and fairs, and churches, and other public amusements go on.","Remarkable trait in the American Character is the union, not very infrequent, of Yankee cleverness with spiritualism.","The Italians are fond of red clothes, peacock plumes, and embroidery; and I remember one rainy morning in the city of Palermo, the street was ablaze with scarlet umbrellas.","We seek our friend not sacredly, but with an adulterate passion which would appropriate him to ourselves.","Conversation is a game of circles.","The charm of the best courages is that they are inventions, inspirations, flashes of genius.","Art and power will go on as they have done,--will make day out of night, time out of space, and space out of time.","It has come to be practically a sort of rule in literature that a man, having once shown himself capable of original writing, is entitled thenceforth to steal from the writings of others at discretion.","Echo waits with art and care And will the faults of song repair.","Eloquence is the appropriate organ of the highest personal energy.","It is the doctrine of the popular music-masters, that whoever can speak can sing. So, probably, every man is eloquent once in his life. Our temperaments differ in capacity of heat, or","There is no eloquence without a man behind it.","Eloquence must be grounded on the plainest narrative.","All infractions of love and equity in our social relations are ... punished by fear.","Genius has no taste for weaving sand.","The gift, to be true, must be the flowing of the giver unto me, correspondent to my flowing unto him.","Cupid is a casuist, a mystic, and a cabalist,-- Can your lurking thought surprise, And interpret your device, . . . . All things wait for and divine him,-- How shall I dare to malign him?","Nature never sends a great man into the planet, without confiding the secret to another soul.","The hero is not fed on sweets, Daily his own heart he eats; Chambers of the great are jails, And head-winds right for royal sails.","All history is but the lengthened shadow of a great man.","A man is the whole encyclopedia of facts. The creation of a thousand forests is in one acorn, and Egypt, Greece, Rome, Gaul, Britain, America, lie folded already in the first man.","The house is a castle which the King cannot enter.","God had infinite time to give us.... He cut it up into a near succession of new mornings, and, with each, therefore, a new idea, new inventions, and new applications.","Persecution readily knits friendship between its victims.","Philanthropies and charities have a certain air of quackery.","Wealth and poverty are seen for what they are. It begins to be seen that the poor are only they who feel poor, and poverty consists in feeling poor. The rich, as we reckon them, and among them the very rich, in a true scale would be found very indigent and ragged.","Alas for the unhappy man that is called to stand in the pulpit, and not give the bread of life.","And striving to be Man, the worm Mounts through all the spires of form.","The man in the street does not know a star in the sky.","This body, full of faults, Has yet one great quality: Whatever it encounters in this temporal life depends upon one\'s actions.","Our high respect for a well-read man is praise enough for literature. - Ralph Waldo Emerson","The reality is more excellent than the report.","No book was ever written down by any but itself.","Let no one honour me with tears, or bury me with lamentation. Why? Because I fly hither and thither, living in the mouths of me.","I consider theology to be the rhetoric of morals.","The poet, the painter, the sculptor, the musican, the architect, seek each to concentrate this radiance of the world on one point, and each in his several work to satisfy the love of beauty which stimulates him to produce.","The word unto the prophet spoken Was writ on tablets yet unbroken: The word by seers or sibyls told, In groves of oak or fanes of gold, Still floats upon the morning wind, Still whispers to the willing mind.","You cannot hide any secret. If the artist succor his flagging spirits by opium or wine, his work will characterize itself as the effect of opium or wine. If you make a picture or a statue, it sets the beholder in that state of mind you had when you made it. If you spend for show, on building, or gardening, or on pictures, or on equipages, it will so appear. We are all physiognomists and penetrators of character, and things themselves are detective.","A person\'s life is limited but serving the people is limitless. I want to devote my limited life to serving the people limitlessly.","Had I but written as many odes in praise of Muhammad and Ali as I have composed for King Mahmud, they would have showered a hundred blessings on me.","The true ship is the ship builder.","I do not see how a barbarous community and a civilized community can constitute a state. I think we must get rid of slavery or we must get rid of freedom.","The sign and credentials of the poet are that he announces that which no man foretold","Out of sleeping a waking, Out of waking a sleep.","The only right is what is after my constitution; the only wrong is what is against it.","Some of the sweetest hours in life, in retrospect will be found to have been spent with books.","I see that sensible men and conscientious men all over the world were of one religion of well-doing and daring.","The difference between talent and genius is in the direction of the current: in genius, it is from within outward; in talent from without inward.","A good form strikes all eyes pleasantly, long before they have any science on the subject; and a beautiful face sets twenty hearts in palpitation, prior to all consideration of the mechanical proportions of the features and head.","So shall we come to look at the world with new eyes.","As picture teaches the colouring, so sculpture the anatomy of form.","The art of sculpture is long ago perished to any real effect... it is the game of a rude and youthful people, and not the manly labour of a wise and spiritual nation.","Old age brings along with its uglinesses the comfort that you will soon be out of it, - which ought to be a substantial relief to such discontented pendulums as we are.","The cannon will not suffer any other sound to be heard for miles and for years around it.","Whatever it is, it\'s better in the wind.","The state of society is one in which the members have suffered amputation from the trunk, and strut about so many walking monsters, - a good finger, a neck, a stomach, an elbow, but never a man. Man is thus metamorphosed into a thing, into many things. The planter, who is Man sent out into the field to gather food, is seldom cheered by any idea of the true dignity of his ministry. He sees his bushel and his cart, and nothing beyond, and sinks into the farmer, instead of Man on the farm.","Cities of mortals woe-begone Fantastic care derides, But in the serious landscape lone Stern benefit abides.","You see, it\'s all clear, we were meant to be here from the beginning.","Who is he that shall control me? Why may not I act and speak and write and think with entire freedom? What am I to the universe, or, the unvierse, what is it to me? Who hath forged the chains of wrong and right, of Opinion and Custom? And must I wear them?","Whenever the average intellect of the clergy declines in the balance with the average intellect of the people the churches will be shut up and a new order of things [will] begin.","I will not live out of me I will not see with others\' eyes My good is good, my evil ill I would be free.","Religionists are clinging to little, positive, verbal, formal versions of the moral law... while the laws of the Law, the great circling truths whose only adequate symbol is the material laws, the astronomy etc. are all unobserved, and sneered at when spoken of.","The exercise of all the senses is as intense pleasure, as anyone will find, who recovers the use of one after being deprived of it.","Natural science sharpens the discrimination. There is no false logic in nature. All its properties are permanent: the acids and metals never lie; their yea is yea, their nay, nay. They are newly discovered but not new.","We are always getting ready to live, but never living... The wave moves onward but the particles of which it is composed do not... It cannot be but that at intervals throughout society there are real men intermixed . . . as the carpenter puts one iron bar in his bannister for every five or six wooden ones.","When the vain speaker has sat down, and the people say \'what a good speech,\' it still takes an ounce to balance an ounce.","What is the end of human life? It is not, believe me, the chief end of man that he should make a fortune and beget children whose end is likewise to make a fortune, but it is, in few words, that he should explore himself.","The wise skeptic does not teach doubt but how] to look for the permanent in the mutable and fleeting.","To speak truly, few adult persons can see nature. Most persons do not see the sun. At least they have a very superficial seeing. The sun illuminates only the eye of the man, but shines into the eye and heart of the child.","The instincts of the ant are very unimportant, considered as the ants; but the moment a ray of relation is seen to be a monitor, a little body with a mighty heart, then all its habits, even that said to be recently observed, that it never sleeps, become sublime.","We flee away from cities, but we bring The best of cities, these learned classifiers, Men knowing what they seek, armed eyes of experts.","The restraining grace of common sense is the mark of all valid minds.","Gold and iron are good To buy iron and gold.","If with love thy heart has burned; If thy love is unreturned; Hide thy grief within thy breast, Though it tear thee unexpressed; For when love has once departed From the eyes of the false-hearted, And one by one has torn off quite The bandages of purple light; Though thou wert the loveliest Form the soul had ever dressed, Thou shalt seem, in each reply, A vixen to his altered eye; Thy softest pleadings seem too bold, Thy praying lute will seem to scold; Though thou kept the straightest road, Yet thou errest far and broad.","Night-dreams trace on Memory\'s wall Shadows of the thoughts of day, And thy fortunes, as they fall, The bias of the will betray.","Our life is not so much threatened as our perception. Ghostlike we glide through nature, and should not know our place again.","Fear, Craft and Avarice Cannot rear a State.","And I myself, in Rome, heard it said openly in the streets, \\"If there is a hell, then Rome is built on it.\\" MARTIN LUTHER, Against the Roman Papacy, An Institution of the Devil London is the epitome of our times, and the Rome of to-day.","Solitude, the safeguard of mediocrity, is to genius, the stern friend, the cold, obscure shelter where moult the wings which will bear it farther than suns and stars.","I am not engaged to Christianity by decent forms, or saving ordinances; it is not usage, it is not what I do not understand, that binds me to it -- let these be the sandy foundations of falsehoods. What I revere and obey in it is its reality, its boundless charity, its deep interior life, the rest it gives to my mind, the echo it returns to my thoughts, the perfect accord it makes with my reason through all its representation of God and His Providence; and the persuasion and courage that come out thence to lead me upward and onward.","In the morning a man walks with his whole body; in the evening, only with his legs. RALPH WALDO EMERSON, Journals and Miscellaneous Notebooks Greek architecture is the perfect flowering of geometry.","Nature abhors the old.","By fate, not option, frugal Nature gave One scent to hyson and to wall-flower, One sound to pine-groves and to water-falls, One aspect to the desert and the lake. It was her stern necessity : all things Are of one pattern made; bird, beast, and flower, Song, picture, form, space, thought, and character Deceive us, seeming to be many things, And are but one.","If you tax too high, the revenue will yield nothing.","How can he [today\'s writer] be honored, when he does not honor himself; when he loses himself in the crowd; when he is no longer the lawgiver, but the sycophant, ducking to the giddy opinion of a reckless public.","Yet a man may love a paradox, without losing either his wit or his honesty.","If the colleges were better, if they had the power of imparting valuable thought, creative principles, truths which become powers, thoughts which become talents, - if they could cause that a mind not profound should become profound, - we should all rush to their gates: instead of contriving inducements to draw students, you would need to set police at the gates to keep order in the in-rushing multitude.","If I made laws for Shakers or a school, I should gazette every Saturday all the words they were wont to use in reporting religious experience, as \\"spiritual life,\\" \\"God,\\" \\"soul,\\" \\"cross,\\" etc., and if they could not find new ones next week, they might remain silent.","Circles, like the soul, are neverending and turn round and round without a stop.","Every man is a new method.","I think no virtue goes with size;The reason of all cowardiceIs, that men are overgrown,And, to be valiant, must come downTo the titmouse dimension.","A man is a golden impossibility. The line he must walk is a hair\'s breadth. The wise through excess of wisdom is made a fool.","As sunbeams stream through liberal space And nothing jostle or displace, So waved the pine-tree through my thought And fanned the dreams it never brought.","Only the great generalizations survive. The sharp words of the Declaration of Independence, lampooned then and since as \'glittering generalities,\' have turned out blazing ubiquities that will burn forever and ever.","The perception of the comic is a tie of sympathy with other men.","The virtues of society are the vices of the saints.","Speech is better than silence; silence is better than speech.","For no man can write anything who does not think that what he writes is, for the time, the history of the world.","The world is upheld by the veracity of good men: they make the earth wholesome.","The word liberty in the mouth of Mr. Webster sounds like the word love in the mouth of a courtesan.","In every man\'s memory, with the hours when life culminated are usually associated certain books which met his views.","Nothing divine dies. All good is eternally reproductive. The beauty of Nature re-forms itself in the mind, and not for barren contemplation, but for new creation.","Nature is the symbol of Spirit.","...man is an analogist, and studies relations in all objects. He is placed in the center of beings, and a ray of relation passes from every other being to him. And neither can man be understood without these objects, nor these objects without man.","The voyage of the best ship is a zigzag line of a hundred tacks.","Let us learn the meaning of economy. Economy is a high human office,--a sacrament when its aim is grand, when it is the prudence of simple tastes, when it is practised for freedom or for love or devotion.","The ocean is a large drop; a drop is a small ocean.","The thing done avails, and not what is said about it.","There the great Planter plants Of fruitful worlds the grain, And with a million spells enchants The souls that walk in pain.","Or whipping its rough surface for a trout.","Emancipation is the demand of civilization. That is a principle; everything else is an intrigue.","Let none presume to measure the irregularities of Michael Angelo or Socrates by village scales.","Other world? There is no other world; here or nowhere is the whole fact.","That which shows God in me, fortifies me. That which shows God out of me, makes me a wart and a wen.","To aim to convert a man by miracles is a profanation of the soul.","The word Miracle, as pronounced by Christian churches, gives a false impression; it is Monster. It is not one with the blowing clover and the falling rain.","The way of Providence is a little rude. The habit of snake and spider, the snap of the tiger and other leapers and bloody jumpers, the crackle of the bones of his prey in the coil of the anaconda-these are in the system, and our habits are like theirs.","Power resides in the moment of transition from a past to a new state.","As gas-light is found to be the best nocturnal police, so the universe protects itself by pitiless publicity.","Self-trust is the first secret of success, the belief that if you are here the authorities of the universe put you here, and for cause, or with some task strictly appointed you in your constitution, and so long as you work at that you are well and successful","he who should inspire and lead his race must be defended from travelling with the souls of other men, from living, breathing, reading, and writing in the daily, time-worn yoke of their opinions.","I believe that our own experience instructs us that the secret of Education lies in respecting the pupil. It is not for you to choose what he shall know, what he shall do. It is chosen and foreordained, and he only holds the key to his own secret. By your tampering and thwarting and too much governing he may be hindered from his end and kept out of his own. Respect the child. Wait and see the new product of Nature. Nature loves analogies, but not repetitions. Respect the child. Be not too much his parent. Trespass not on his solitude.","The ancestor of every action is thought; when we understand that we begin to comprehend that our world is governed by thought and that everything without had its counterpart originally within the mind.","To Be is to live with God.","A person seldom falls sick but the bystanders are animated with a faint hope that he will die.","Who loses a day loses life.","Life is too short to waste.","A weed is a plant we\'ve found no use for yet.","The aristocrat is the democrat ripe, and gone to seed.","Judicious praise is to children what the sun is to flowers. Christian Bovee A little praise Goes a great ways.","Why should we grope among the dry bones of the past, or put the living generation into masquerade out of its faded wardrobe?","The present is an edifice which God cannot rebuild.","He who has acquired the ability, may wait securely the occasion of making it felt and appreciated, and know that it will not loiter.","We grizzle every day. I see no need of it. Whilst we converse with what is above us, we do not grow old, but grow young.","In the true mythology, Love is an immortal child, and Beauty leads him as a guide; nor can we express a deeper sense than when we say, Beauty is the pilot of the young soul.","Don\'t hang a dismal picture on the wall, and do not daub with sables and glooms in your conversation. Don\'t be a cynic and disconsolate preacher. Don\'t bewail and bemoan. Omit the negative propositions. Nerve us with incessant affirmatives. Don\'t waste yourself in rejection, nor bark against the bad, but chant the beauty of the good. When that is spoken which has a right to be spoken, the chatter and the criticism will stop. Set down nothing that will not help somebody.","We believe that the defects of so many perverse and so many frivolous people, who make up society, are organic, and society is a hospital of incurables.","The cruelest foe is a masked benefactor. The wars which make history so dreary have served the cause of truth and virtue.","The domestic man, who loves no music so well as his kitchen clock, and the airs which the logs sing to him as they burn on the hearth, has solaces which others never dream of.","In dreams we are true poets; we create the persons of the drama; we give them appropriate figures faces, costumes; they are perfect in their organs, attitudes, manners; moreover they speak after their own characters, not ours; and we listen with surprise to what they say.","Thus is man made equal to every event. He can face danger for the right. A poor, tender, painful body, he can run into flame or bullets or pestilence, with duty for his guide.","Education should be as broad as man.","Teach the children! It is painting in fresco.","We shall one day learn to supersede politics by education. What we call our root-and-branch reforms of slavery, war, gambling, intemperance, is only medicating the symptoms. We must begin higher up, namely, in education.","What we do not call education is more precious than that which we call so. We form no guess, at the time of receiving a thought, of its comparative value. And education often wastes its effort in attempts to thwart and balk this natural magnetism, which is sure to select what belongs to it.","Only by the supernatural is a man strong--only by confiding in the divinity which stirs within us. Nothing is so weak as an egotist--nothing is mightier than we, when we are vehicles of a truth before which the state and the individual are alike ephemeral.","The pest of society is egotists.","There are dull and bright, sacred and profane, coarse and fine egotists. It is a disease that, like influenza, falls on all constitutions. In the distemper known to physicians as chorea, the patient sometimes turns round, and continues to spin slowly in one spot. Is egotism a metaphysical varioloid of this malady?","The poet\'s habit of living should be set on a key so low that the common influences should delight him.","Poets should be law-givers; that is, the boldest lyric inspiration should not chide and insult, but should announce and lead the civil code, and the day\'s work.","Only that is poetry which cleanses and mans me.","Defect in manners is usually the defect of fine perceptions. Men are too coarsely made for the delicacy of beautiful carriage and customs. It is not quite sufficient to good breeding, a union of kindness and independence.","The truth, the hope, of any time must be sought in the minorities. Michael Angelo was the conscience of Italy. We grow free with his name, and find it ornamental now, but in his own day his friends were few.","All things with which we deal preach to us. What is a farm but a mute gospel? The chaff and the wheat, weeds and plants, blight, rain, insects, sun,--it is a sacred emblem from the first furrow of spring to the last stack which the snow of winter overtakes in the fields.","The orator is thereby an orator that keeps his feet ever on a fact.","Pride eradicates all vices but itself.","Pride is handsome, economical; pride eradicates so many vices, letting none subsist but itself, that it seems as if it were a great gain to exchange vanity for pride.","Let us interrogate the great apparition, that shines so peacefully around us.","The rain comes when the wind calls.","Read proudly--put the duty of being read invariably on the author. If he is not read, whose fault is it? I am quite ready to be charmed, but I shall not make-believe I am charmed.","It is the property of the religious spirit to be the most refining of all influences. No external advantages, no culture of the tastes, no habit of command, no association with the elegant, or even depth of affection, can bestow that delicacy and that grandeur of bearing which belong only to the mind accustomed to celestial conversation,--all else is but gilt and cosmetics, beside this, as expressed in every look and gesture.","Natural religion supplies still all the facts which are disguised under the dogma of popular creeds. The progress of religion is steadily to its identity with morals.","Religion must always be a crab fruit; it cannot be grafted, and keep its wild beauty.","I like the church, I like a cowl,\\nI love a prophet of the soul;\\nAnd on my heart monastic aisles\\nFall like sweet strains or pensive smiles;\\nYet not for all his faith can see,\\nWould I that cowled churchman be.","The river knows the way to the sea:\\nWithout a pilot it runs and falls,\\nBlessing all lands with its charity.","There is no den in the wide world to hide a rogue.","A man\'s action is only a poicture book of his creed.","Every noble activity makes room for itself.","Accuracy is essential to beauty.","Nothing is arbitrary, nothing is insulated in beauty. It depends forever on the necessary and the useful. The plumage of the bird, the mimic plumage of the insect, has a reason for its rich colors in the constitution of the animal. Fitness is so inseparable an accompaniment of beauty, that it, has been taken for it.","The beautiful is never plentiful.","Who gave thee, O Beauty,\\nThe keys of this breast,--\\nToo credulous lover\\nOf blest and unblest?\\nSay, when in lapsed ages\\nThee knew I of old?\\nOr what was the service\\nFor which I was sold?","There are many virtues in books, but the essential value is the adding of knowledge to our stock by the record of new facts, and, better, by the record of intuitions which distribute facts, and are the formulas which supersede all histories.","The craft with which the world is made runs also into the mind and character of men. No man is quite sane; each has a vein of folly in his composition, a slight determination of blood to the head, to make sure of holding him hard to some one point which Nature has taken to heart.","If we will take the good we find, asking no questions, we shall have heaping measures. The great gifts are not got by analysis. Everything good is on the highway. The middle region of our being is the temperate zone.","Courage is temperamental, scientific, ideal.","Courage of the soldier awakes the courage of woman.","The days are made on a loom whereof the warp and woof are past and future time. They are majestically dressed, as if every god brought a thread to the skyey web.","Daughter of Time, the hypocrite Days,\\nMuffled and dumb like barefoot dervishes,\\nAnd marching single in an endless file,\\nBring diadems and fagots in their hands;\\nTo each they offer gifts after his will,\\nBread, kingdom, stars, and sky that holds them all;\\nI, in my pleached garden watched the pomp\\nForgot my morning wishes, hastily\\nTook a few herbs and apples, and the Day\\nTurned and departed silent. I too late\\nUnder her solemn fillet saw the scorn.","The manly part is to do with might and main what you can do.","I have heard that death takes us away from ill things, not from good. I have heard that when we pronounce the name of man we pronounce the belief of immortality.","Men are what their mothers made them. You may as well ask a loom which weaves huckabuck why it does not make cashmere as to expect poetry from this engineer or a chemical discovery from that jobber.","As much wisdom may be expended on a private economy as on an empire, and as much wisdom may be drawn from it.","England, an old and exhausted island, must one day be contented, like other parents, to be strong only in her children.","Spoons and skimmers you can be undistinguishably together; but vases and statues require each a pedestal for itself.","Evil is merely privative, not absolute: it is like cold, which is the privation of beat.","Say, what other metre is it\\nThan the meeting of the eyes?\\nNature poureth into nature\\nThrough the channels of that feature\\nRiding on the ray of sight,\\nFleeter far than whirlwinds go,\\nOr for service, or delight,\\nHearts to hearts their meaning show.","When a man speaks the truth in the spirit of truth, his eye is as clear as the heavens. When he has base ends, and speaks falsely, the eye is muddy, and sometimes asquint.","I have been told by persons of experience in matters of taste, that the fashions follow a law of gradation, and are never arbitrary. The new mode is always only a step onward in the same direction as the last mode; and a cultivated eye is prepared for and predicts the new fashion.","Manners have been somewhat cynically defined to be a contrivance of wise men to keep fools at a distance. Fashion is shrewd to detect those who do not belong to her train, and seldom wastes her attentions. Society is very swift in its instincts, and if you do not belong to it, resists and sneers at you, or quietly drops you.","Thus grows up fashion, an equivocal semblance, the most puissant, the most fantastic and frivolous, the most feared and followed, and which morals and violence assault in vain.","We can only obey our own polarity.","The genius of life is friendly to the noble, and, in the dark, brings them friends from far.","All men in the abstract are just and good.","Governments have their origin in the moral identity of men.","Great men are sincere.","Great men do not content us. It is their solitude, not their force, that makes them conspicuous.","Hume\'s doctrine was that the circumstances vary, the amount of happiness does not; that the beggar cracking fleas in the sunshine under a hedge, and the duke rolling by in his chariot, the girl equipped for her first ball, and the orator returning triumphant from the debate, had different means, but the same quantity of pleasant excitement.","Every heroic act measures itself by its contempt of some external good. But it finds its own success at last, and then the prudent also extol.","There comes a period of the imagination to each--a later youth--the power of beauty, the power of looks, of poetry.","Justice satisfies everybody, and justice alone.","We are not very much to blame for our bad marriages. We live amid hallucinations, and especial trap is laid to trip up our feet with, and all are tripped up first or last. But the mighty mother, who had been so sly with us, as if she felt she owed us some indemnity, insinuates into the Pandora box of marriage some deep and serious benefits, and some great joys.","The value of a dollar is to buy just things; a dollar goes on increasing in value with all the genius and all the virtue of the world. A dollar in a university is worth more than a dollar in a jail; in a temperate, schooled, law-abiding community than in some sink of crime, where dice, knives, and arsenic are in constant play.","Not a ray is dimmed, not an atom worn; nature\'s oldest force is as good as new.","All nobility in its beginnings was somebody\'s natural superiority.","We must have kings, we must have nobles; nature is always providing such in every society; only let us have the real instead of the titular. In every society some are born to rule, and some to advise. The chief is the chief all the world over, only not his cap and plume. It is only this dislike of the pretender which makes men sometimes unjust to the true and finished man.","Politics is a deleterious profession, like some poisonous handicrafts.","All the elements, whose aid man calls in, will sometimes become big masters.","Providence has a wild, rough, incalculable road to its end, and it is of no use to try to whitewash its huge, mixed instrumentalities, or to dress up that terrific benefactor in a clean shirt and white neckcloth of a student in divinity.","Prudence is the virtue of the senses. It is the science of appearances. It is the outmost action of the inward life.","Spurious prudence, making the senses final, is the god of sots and cowards, and is the subject of all comedy. It is nature\'s joke, and therefore literature\'s. True prudence limits this sensualism by admitting the knowledge of an internal and real world.","Would we codify the laws that should reign in households, and whose daily transgression annoys and mortifies us, and degrades our household life, we must adorn every day with sacrifices. Good manners are made up of petty sacrifices.","The resources of the scholar are proportioned to his confidence in the attributes of the intellect.","Self-love is, in almost all men, such an over-weight that they are incredulous of a man\'s habitual preference of the general good to his own; but when they see it proved by sacrifices of ease, wealth, rank, and of life itself, there is no limit to their admiration.","No nation has produced anything like his equal. There is no quality in the human mind, there is no class of topics, there is no region of thought, in which he has not soared or descended, and none in which he has not said the commanding word.","What king has he not taught state, as Talma taught Napoleon? What maiden has not found him finer than her delicacy? What lover has he not outloved? What sage has he not outseen? What gentleman has he not instructed in the rudeness of his behavior?","The passages of Shakespeare that we most prize were never quoted until within this century.","Slavery is no scholar, no improver; it does not love the whistle of the railroad; it does not love the newspaper, the mailbag, a college, a book or a preacher who has the absurd whim of saying what he thinks; it does not increase the white population; it does not improve the soil; everything goes to decay.","I have just been conversing with one man, to whom no weight of adverse experience will make it for a moment appear impossible that thousands of human beings might exercise towards each other the grandest and simplest sentiments, as well as a knot of friends, or a pair of lovers.","Besides the general infusion of wit to heighten civility, the direct splendor of intellectual power is ever welcome in fine society, as the costliest addition to its rule and its credit.","Human society is made up of partialities. Each citizen has an interest and a view of his own, which, if followed out to the extreme, would leave no room for any other citizen.","In this great society wide lying around us, a critical analysis would find very few spontaneous actions. It is almost all custom and gross sense.","It is the fine souls who serve us, and not what is called fine society. Fine society is only a self-protection against the vulgarities of the street and the tavern.","Society will pardon much to genius and special gifts; but, being in its nature conventional, it loves what is conventional, or what belongs to coming together.","Heaven often protects valuable souls charged with great secrets, great ideas, by long shutting them up with their own thoughts.","Nature always wears the colors of the spirit. To a man laboring under calamity the heat of his own fire hath sadness in it. Then there is a kind of contempt of the landscape felt by him who has just lost by death a dear friend. The sky is less grand as it shuts down over less worth in the population.","The action of the soul is oftener in that which is felt and left unsaid than in that which is said in any conversation. It broods over every society, and men unconsciously seek for it in each other.","The imaginative faculty of the soul must be fed with objects immense and eternal.","The soul knows no persons.","Style is only the frame to hold your thoughts. It is like the sash of a window; if heavy, it will obscure the light.","We owe to man higher succors than food and fire. We owe to man, man.","We imperatively require a perception of and a homage to beauty in our companions. Other virtues are in request in the field and workyard, but a certain degree of taste is not to be spared in those we sit with.","What a benefit would the American government, not yet relieved of its extreme need, render to itself, and to every city, village and hamlet in the States, if it would tax whiskey and rum almost to the point of prohibition! Was it Bonaparte who said that he found vices very good patriots? \\"He got five millions from the love of brandy, and he should be glad to know which of the virtues would pay him as much.\\" Tobacco and opium have broad backs, and will cheerfully carry the load of armies, if you choose to make them pay high for such joy as they give and such harm as they do.","Such is the active power of good temperament! Great sweetness of temper neutralizes such vast amounts of acid.","By virtue of the Deity thought renews itself inexhaustibly every day and the thing whereon it shines, though it were dust and sand, is a new subject with countless relations.","With thought, with the ideal, is immortal hilarity, the rose of joy. Round it all the muses sing.","How silent, how spacious, what room for all, yet without place to insert an atom--in graceful succession, in equal fullness, in balanced beauty, the dance of the hours goes forward still. Like an odor of incense, like a strain of music, like a sleep, it is inexact and boundless. It will not be dissected, nor unraveled, nor shown.","Traveling is a fool\'s paradise.","He that despiseth small things will perish by little and little.","I see my trees repair their boughs.","We do not yet trust the unknown power of thoughts.","Truth gathers itself spotless and unhurt after all our surrenders and concealments and partisanship; never hurt by the treachery or ruin of its best defenders, whether Luther, or William Penn, or St. Paul.","Truth is beautiful within and without, forevermore.","Vanity costs money, labor, horses, men, women, health and peace, and is still nothing at last,--a long way leading nowhere.","The earth is a machine which yields almost gratuitous service to every application of intellect. Every plant is a manufacturer of soil. In the stomach of the plant development begins. The tree can draw on the whole air, the whole earth, on all the rolling main. The plant is all suction-pipe,--imbibing from the ground by its root, from the air by its leaves, with all its might.","Virtue alone is sweet society,\\nIt keeps the key to all heroic hearts,\\nAnd opens you a welcome in them all.","All history is the decline of war, though the slow decline. All that society has yet gained is mitigation; the doctrine of the right of war still remains.","Use makes a better soldier than the most urgent considerations of duty,--familiarity with danger enabling him to estimate the danger. He sees how much is the risk, and is not afflicted with imagination; knows practically Marshal Saxe\'s rule, that every soldier killed costs the enemy his weight in lead.","War disorganizes, but it is to reorganize.","The pulpit and the press have many commonplaces denouncing the thirst for wealth, but if men should take these moralists at their word, and leave off aiming to be rich, the moralists would rush to rekindle at all hazards this love of power in the people, lest civilization should be undone.","Body cannot teach wisdom; God only.","Wisdom is infused into every form.","Of all wit\'s uses, the main one is to live well with who has none.","The finest wits have their sediment.","True wit never made us laugh.","Wit makes its own welcome, and levels all distinction. No dignity, no learning, no force of character, can make any stand against good wit. It is like ice, on which no beauty of form, no majesty of carriage, can plead any immunity; they must walk gingerly, according to the laws of ice, or down they must go, dignity and all.","That is ever the difference between the wise and the unwise: the latter wonders at what is unusual; the wise man wonders at the usual.","Women see through Claude Lorraines.","In the woods, too, a man casts off his years, as the snake his slough, and at what period soever of life, is always a child. In the woods is perpetual youth. Within these plantations of God a decorum and sanctity reign, a perennial festival is dressed, and the guest sees not how he should tire of them in a thousand years. In the woods we return to reason and faith.","It is greatest to believe and to hope well of the world, because he who does so, quits the world of experience, and makes the world he lives in.","If you would learn to write, it is in the street you must learn it. Both for the vehicle and for the aims of fine arts, you must frequent the public square. The people, and not the college, is the writer\'s home. A scholar is a candle which the love and desire of all men will light.","There is no God dare wrong a worm.","Youth is everywhere in place.","We say the cows laid out Boston. Well, there are worse surveyors.","Every man supposes himself not to be fully understood; and if there is any truth in him, if he rests at last on the divine soul, I see not how it can be otherwise. The last chamber, the last closet, he must feel, was never opened; there is always a residuum unknown, unanalyzable. That is, every man believes that he has a greater possibility.","The world - this shadow of the soul, or other me - lies wide around. Its attractions are the keys which unlock my thoughts and make me acquainted with myself. I run eagerly into this resounding tumult... So much only of life as I know by experience... The true scholar grudges every opportunity of action past by, as a loss of power.","The soul is no traveller; the wise man stays at home, and when his necessities, his duties, on any occasion call him from his house, or into foreign lands, he is at home still, and shall make men sensible by the expression of his countenance, that he goes the missionary of wisdom and virtue, and visits cities and men like a sovereign, and not like an interloper or a valet.","Always the seer is a sayer. Somehow his dream is told; somehow he publishes it with solemn joy: sometimes with pencil on canvas, sometimes with chisel on stone, sometimes in towers and aisles of granite, his soul\'s worship is builded; sometimes in anthems of indefinite music, but clearest and most permanent, in words.","...as there is no screen or ceiling between our heads and the infinite heavens, so is there no bar or wall in the soul where man, the effect, ceases, and God, the cause, begins. The walls are taken away. We lie open on one side to the deeps of spiritual nature, to the attributes of God. Justice we see and know, Love, Freedom, Power. These natures no man ever got above, but they tower over us, and most in the moment when our interests tempt us to wound them.","There is some awe mixed with the joy of our surprise, when this poet, who lived in some past world, two or three hundred years ago, says that which lies close to my own soul, that which I also had wellnigh thought and said.","Few and mean as my gifts may be, I actually am, and do not need for my own assurance or the assurance of my fellows any secondary testimony.","It is commonly observed that a sudden wealth, like a prize drawn in a lottery or a large bequest to a poor family, does not permanently enrich. They have served no apprenticeship to wealth, and with the rapid wealth come rapid claims which they do not know how to deny, and the treasure is quickly dissipated.","In England every man you meet is some man\'s son; in America, he may be some man\'s father.","The world still wants its poet-priest, a reconciler, who shall not trifle with Shakspeare the player, nor shall grope in graves with Swedenborg the mourner; but who shall see, speak, and act, with equal inspiration. For knowledge will brighten the sunshine; right is more beautiful than private affection; and love is compatible with universal wisdom.","Nor sequent centuries could hit\\nOrbit and sum of SHAKSPEARE\'s wit.\\nThe men who lived with him became\\nPoets, for the air was fame.","There is, in all great poets, a wisdom of humanity which is superior to any talents they exercise.","We call the beautiful the highest, because it appears to us the golden mean, escaping the dowdiness of the good and the heartlessness of the true.","It is true that genius takes its rise out of the mountains of rectitude; that all beauty and power which men covet are somehow born out of that Alpine district; that any extraordinary degree of beauty in man or woman involves a moral charm.","The virtue of art lies in detachment, in sequestering one object from the embarrassing variety. Until one thing comes out from theconnection of things, there can be enjoyment, contemplation, but no thought.","By going one step further back in thought, discordant opinions are reconciled by being seen to be two extremes of one principle, and we can never go so far back as to preclude a still higher vision.","Generalization is always a new influx of divinity into the mind. Hence the thrill that attends it.","Do not craze yourself with thinking, but go about your business anywhere.","Thought dissolves the material universe by carrying the mind up into a sphere where all is plastic.","And what avails it that science has come to treat space and time as simply forms of thought, and the material world as hypothetical, and withal our pretension of property and even of self-hood are fading with the rest, if, at last, even our thoughts are not finalities, but the incessant flowing and ascension reach these also, and each thought which yesterday was a finality, to-day is yielding to a larger generalization?","What is addressed to us for contemplation does not threaten us, but makes us intellectual beings.","Our thinking is a pious reception.","Why needs a man be rich? Why must he have horses, fine garments, handsome apartments, access to public houses, and places of amusement? Only for want of thought.","To the young mind every thing is individual, stands by itself. By and by, it finds how to join two things and see in them one nature; then three, then three thousand; and so, tyrannized over by its own unifying instinct, it goes on tying things together, diminishing anomalies, discovering roots running under ground whereby contrary and remote things cohere and flower out from one stem.","The crystal sphere of thought is as concentrical as the geological structure of the globe. As our soils and rocks lie in strata, concentric strata, so do all men\'s thinkings run laterally, never vertically.","How much more the seeker of abstract truth, who needs periods of isolation, and rapt concentration, and almost a going out of thebody to think!","Music and Wine are one.","In Haydn\'s oratorios, the notes present to the imagination not only motions, as, of the snake, the stag, and the elephant, but colors also; as the green grass.","Two touch the string,\\nThe harp is dumb.","To finish the moment, to find the journey\'s end in every step of the road, to live the greatest number of good hours, is wisdom. It is not the part of men, but of fanatics, or of mathematicians, if you will, to say, that, the shortness of life considered, it is not worth caring whether for so short a duration we were sprawling in want, or sitting high. Since our office is with moments, let us husband them.","The first questions are always to be asked, and the wisest doctor is gravelled by the inquisitiveness of a child.","Be lord of a day, through wisdom and justice, and you can put up your history books.","It is so wonderful to our neurologists that a man can see without his eyes, that it does not occur to them that is just as wonderful that he should see with them; and that is ever the difference between the wise and the unwise: the latter wonders at what is unusual, the wise man wonders at the usual.","To educate the wise man, the State exists; and with the appearance of the wise man, the State expires. The appearance of charactermakes the state unnecessary. The wise man is the State.","We judge of a man\'s wisdom by his hope, knowing that the inexhaustibleness of nature is an immortal youth.","Drudgery, calamity, exasperation, want, are instructors in eloquence and wisdom.","Much of the wisdom of the world is not wisdom, and the most illuminated class of men are no doubt superior to literary fame, and are not writers.","There is a certain wisdom of humanity which is common to the greatest men with the lowest, and which our ordinary education oftenlabors to silence and obstruct.","It is the delight of vulgar talent to dazzle and to bind the beholder. But true genius seeks to defend us from itself. True geniuswill not impoverish, but will liberate, and add new sense. If a wise man should appear in our village, he would create, in those who conversed with him, a new consciousness of wealth, by opening their eyes to unobserved advantages; he would establish a sense of immovable equality, calm us with assurances that we could not be cheated; as every one would discern the checks and guarantees of condition.","When life has been well spent, age is a loss of what it can well spare,--muscular strength, organic instincts, gross bulk, and works that belong to these. But the central wisdom, which was old in infancy, is young in fourscore years, and dropping off obstructions, leaves in happy subjects the mind purified and wise.","Society always consists, in greatest part, of young and foolish persons. The old, who have seen through the hypocrisy of the courts and statesmen, die, and leave no wisdom to their sons. They believe their own newspaper, as their fathers did at their age.","Health, south wind, books, old trees, a boat, a friend.","Men have come to speak of the revelation as somewhat long ago given and done, as if God were dead. The injury to faith throttles the preacher; and the goodliest of institutions becomes an uncertain and inarticulate voice.","Men are so charmed with valor that they have pleased themselves with being called lions, leopards, eagles and dragons, from the animals contemporary with us in the geologic formations.","There is a persuasion in the soul of man that he is here for cause, that he was put down in this place by the Creator to do the work for which he inspires him, that thus he is an overmatch for all antagonists that could combine against him.","Who does not sometimes envy the good and the brave, who are no more to suffer from the tumults of the natural world, and await with curious complacency the speedy term of his own conversation with finite nature?","The rain has spoiled the farmer\'s day;\\nShall sorrow put my books away?\\nThereby are two days lost.","The finished man of the world must eat of every apple at once. He must hold his hatreds also at arm\'s length, and not remember spite. He has neither friends nor enemies, but values men only as channels of power.","An English family consists of a few persons, who, from youth to age, are found revolving within a few feet of each other, as if tied by some invisible ligature, tense as that cartilage which we have seen attaching the two Siamese.","For, when men shall meet as they ought, each a benefactor, a shower of stars, clothed with thoughts, with deeds, with accomplishments, it should be the festival of nature which all things announce. Of such friendship, love in the sexes is the first symbol, as all other things are symbols of love. Those relations to the best men, which, at one time, we reckoned the romances of youth, become, in the progress of character, the most solid enjoyment.","I know nothing which life has to offer so satisfying as the profound good understanding, which can subsist, after much exchange ofgood offices, between two virtuous men, each of whom is sure of himself, and sure of his friend. It is a happiness which postpones all other gratifications, and makes politics, and commerce, and churches, cheap.","If your friend has displeased you, you shall not sit down to consider it, for he has already lost all memory of the passage, and has doubled his power to serve you, and, ere you can rise up again, will burden you with blessings.","A divine person is the prophecy of the mind; a friend is the hope of the heart.","A friend is Janus-faced: he looks to the past and the future. He is the child of all my foregoing hours, the prophet of those to come, and the harbinger of a greater friend.","A new person is to me a great event, and hinders me from sleep. I have often had fine fancies about persons which have given me delicious hours; but the joy ends in the day; it yields no fruit.","We over-estimate the conscience of our friend. His goodness seems better than our goodness, his nature finer, his temptations less. Everything that is his,--his name, his form, his dress, books, and instruments,--fancy enhances. Our own thought sounds new and larger from his mouth.","In the last analysis, love is only the reflection of a man\'s own worthiness from other men.","Only be admonished by what you already see, not to strike leagues of friendship with cheap persons, where no friendship can be. Our impatience betrays us into rash and foolish alliances which no God attends.","I think I have done well, if I have acquired a new word from a good author; and my business with him is to find my own, though itwere only to melt him down into an epithet or an image for daily use.","It is with a good book as it is with good company.","One must be an inventor to read well.","The genius of reading and of gardening are antagonistic, like resinous and vitreous electricity. One is concentrative in sparks and shocks: the other is diffuse strength; so that each disqualifies its workman for the other\'s duties.","Our relations to each other are oblique and casual.","Almost all people descend to meet. All association must be a compromise, and, what is worst, the very flower and aroma of the flower of each of the beautiful natures disappears as they approach each other.","In the first place, all books that get fairly into the vital air of the world were written by the successful class, by the affirming and advancing class, who utter what tens of thousands feel though they cannot say.","My friends have come to me unsought. The great God gave them to me. By oldest right, by the divine affinity of virtue with itself,I find them, or rather not I, but the Deity in me and in them derides and cancels the thick walls of the individual character, relation, age, sex, circumstance, at which he usually connives, and now makes many one.","The only joy in his being mine, is that the not mine is mine.","Men have sometimes exchanged names with their friends, as if they would signify that in their friend each loved his own soul.","I wish that friendship should have feet, as well as eyes and eloquence. It must plant itself on the ground, before it vaults overthe moon. I wish it to be a little of a citizen, before it is quite a cherub.","The essence of friendship is entireness, a total magnanimity and trust. It must not surmise or provide for infirmity. It treats its object as a god, that it might deify both.","I must feel pride in my friend\'s accomplishments as if they were mine,--and a property in his virtues. I feel as warmly when he ispraised, as the lover when he hears applause of his engaged maiden.","Our friendships hurry to short and poor conclusions, because we have made them a texture of wine and dreams, instead of the toughfibre of the human heart. The laws of friendship are austere and eternal, of one web with the laws of nature and of morals.","Happy is the house that shelters a friend! It might well be built, like a festal bower or arch, to entertain him a single day. Happier, if he know the solemnity of that relation, and honor its law! He offers himself a candidate for that covenant comes up, like an Olympian, to the great games, where the first- born of the world are the competitors.","Then, though I prize my friends, I cannot afford to talk with them and study their visions, lest I lose my own. It would indeed give me a certain household joy to quit this lofty seeking, this spiritual astronomy, or search of stars, and come down to warm sympathies with you; but then I know well I shall mourn always the vanishing of my mighty gods.","You shall not come nearer a man by getting into his house.","We begin with friendships, and all our youth is a reconnoitering and recruiting of the holy fraternity they shall combine for thesalvation of men. But so the remoter stars seem a nebula of united light, yet there is no group which a telescope will not resolve; and the dearest friends are separated by impassable gulfs.","An eminent teacher of girls said, \\"the idea of a girl\'s education, is, whatever qualifies them for going to Europe.","You must treat the days respectfully, you must be a day yourself, and not interrogate it like a college professor.","All the facts of nature are nouns of the intellect, and make the grammar of the eternal language. Every word has a double, trebleor centuple use and meaning.","We are like travellers using the cinders of a volcano to roast their eggs. Whilst we see that it always stands ready to clothe what we would say, we cannot avoid the question whether the characters are not significant of themselves.","This immediate dependence of language upon nature, this conversion of an outward phenomenon into a type of somewhat in human life,never loses its power to affect us. It is this which gives that piquancy to the conversation of a strong-natured farmer or backwoodsman, which all men relish.","Children and savages use only nouns or names of things, which they convert into verbs, and apply to analogous mental acts.","Every word which is used to express a moral or intellectual fact, if traced to its root, is found to be borrowed from some material appearance.","But wise men pierce this rotten diction and fasten words again to visible things; so that picturesque language is at once a commanding certificate that he who employs it, is a man in alliance with truth and God.","Every discourse is an approximate answer: but it is of small consequence, that we do not get it into verbs and nouns, whilst it abides for contemplation forever.","My companion assumes to know my mood and habit of thought, and we go on from explanation to explanation, until all is said that words can, and we leave matters just as they were at first, because of that vicious assumption.","Every word we speak is million-faced or convertible to an indefinite number of applications. If it were not so we could read no book. Your remark would only fit your case, not mine.","An answer in words is delusive; it is really no answer to the questions you ask.","The path of things is silent. Will they suffer a speaker to go with them?","For all symbols are fluxional; all language is vehicular and transitive, and is good, as ferries and horses are, for conveyance, not as farms and houses are, for homestead.","The etymologist finds the deadest word to have been once a brilliant picture. Language is fossil poetry. As the limestone of the continent consists of infinite masses of the shells of animalcules, so language is made up of images or tropes, which now, in their secondary use, have long ceased to remind us of their poetic origin.","Every word was once a poem. Every new relation is a new word.","For, though the origin of most of our words is forgotten, each word was at first a stroke of genius, and obtained currency, because for the moment it symbolized the world to the first speaker and to the hearer. The etymologist finds the deadest word to have been once a brilliant picture.","The history of mankind interests us only as it exhibits a steady gain of truth and right, in the incessant conflict which it records between the material and the moral nature.","There are many faculties in man, each of which takes its turn of activity, and that faculty which is paramount in any period and exerts itself through the strongest nation, determines the civility of that age: and each age thinks its own the perfection of reason.","All inquiry into antiquity, all curiosity respecting the Pyramids, the excavated cities, Stonehenge, the Ohio Circles, Mexico, Memphis,--is the desire to do away this wild, savage, and preposterous There and Then, and introduce in its place the Here and Now.","Let it suffice that in the light of these two facts, namely, that the mind is One, and that nature is its correlative, history isto be read and written.","The Times are the masquerade of the eternities; trivial to the dull, tokens of noble and majestic agents to the wise; the receptacle in which the Past leaves its history; the quarry out of which the genius of today is building up the Future.","The whole value of history, of biography, is to increase my self-trust, by demonstrating what man can be and do.","But lest I should mislead any when I have my own head and obey my whims, let me remind the reader that I am only an experimenter.Do not set the least value on what I do, or the least discredit on what I do not, as if I pretended to settle any thing as true or false. I unsettle all things. No facts are to me sacred; none are profane; I simply experiment, an endless seeker with no Past at my back.","If I have renounced the search of truth, if I have come into the port of some pretending dogmatism, some new church, some Schelling or Cousin, I have died to all use of these new events that are born out of prolific time into multitude of life every hour. I am as bankrupt to whom brilliant opportunities offer in vain. He has just foreclosed his freedom, tied his hands, locked himself up and given the key to another to keep.","The secret of genius is to suffer no fiction to exist for us; to realize all that we know; in the high refinement of modern life,in arts, in sciences, in books, in men, to exact good faith, reality, and a purpose; and first, last, midst, and without end, to honor every truth by use.","For he that feeds men serveth few;\\nHe serves all who dares be true.","Why should you renounce your right to traverse the star-lit deserts of truth, of the premature comforts of an acre, house, and barn? Truth also has its roof, and bed, and board.","Whenever a true theory appears, it will be its own evidence. Its test is, that it will explain all phenomena.","The reason why any one refuses his assent to your opinion, or his aid to your benevolent design, is in you: he refuses to accept you as a bringer of truth, because, though you think you have it, he feels that you have it not. You have not given him the authentic sign.","I cannot often enough say, that a man is only a relative and representative nature. Each is a hint of the truth, but far enough from being that truth, which yet he quite newly and inevitably suggests to us. If I seek it in him, I shall not find it.","Every man finds a sanction for his simplest claims and deeds, in decisions of his own mind, which he calls Truth and Holiness.","Truth has not single victories; all things are its organs,--not only dust and stones, but errors and lies.","But speak the truth, and all nature and all spirits help you with unexpected furtherance. Speak the truth, and all things alive orbrute are vouchers, and the very roots of the grass underground there do seem to stir and move to bear you witness.","We know truth when we see it, from opinion, as we know when we are awake that we are awake.","The solar system has no anxiety about its reputation, and the credit of truth and honesty is as safe; nor have I any fear that a skeptical bias can be given by leaning hard on the sides of fate, of practical power, or of trade, which the doctrine of Faith cannot down-weigh.","The connection between our knowledge and the abyss of being is still real, and the explication must be not less magnificent.","When at last in a race a new principle appears, an idea--that conserves it; ideas only save races.","We are the prisoners of ideas. They catch us up for moments into their heaven, and so fully engage us, that we take no thought forthe morrow, gaze like children, without an effort to make them our own.","Let ideas establish their legitimate sway again in society, let life be fair and poetic, and the scholars will gladly be lovers, citizens, and philanthropists.","General ideas are essences. They are our gods: they round and ennoble the most partial and sordid way of living.","The delicious faces of children, the beauty of school-girls, \\"the sweet seriousness of sixteen,\\" the lofty air of well-born, well-bred boys, the passionate histories in the looks and manners of youth and early manhood, and the varied power in all that well-known company that escort us through life,--we know how these forms thrill, paralyze, provoke, inspire, and enlarge us.","Life loiters at the book\'s first page,--\\nAh! could we turn the leaf.","I wish the days to be as centuries, loaded, fragrant. Now we reckon them as bank-days, by some debt which is to be paid us, or which we are to pay, or some pleasure we are to taste.","Where do we find ourselves? In a series of which we do not know the extremes, and believe that it has none. We wake and find ourselves on a stair; there are stairs below us, which we seem to have ascended; there are stairs above us, many a one, which go upward and out of sight.","Life is a festival only to the wise. Seen from the nook and chimneyside of prudence, it wears a ragged and dangerous front.","The work of vegetation begins first in the irritability of the bark and leaf-buds.","I would study, I would know, I would admire forever.","We swim, day by day, on a river of delusions, and are effectually amused with houses and towns in the air, of which the men aboutus are dupes. But life is a sincerity.","Nature is thoroughly mediate. It is made to serve. It receives the dominion of man as meekly as the ass on which the Saviour rode.It offers all its kingdoms to man as the raw material which he may mould into what is useful. Man is never weary of working it up.","I suppose an entire cabinet of shells would be an expression of the whole human mind; a Flora of the whole globe would be so likewise, or a history of beasts; or a painting of all the aspects of the clouds. Everything is significant.","Not in nature but in man is all the beauty and worth he sees. The world is very empty, and is indebted to this gilding, exalting soul for all its pride.","The mind is a finer body, and resumes its functions of feeding, digesting, absorbing, excluding, and generating, in a new and ethereal element. Here, in the brain, is all the process of alimentation repeated, in the acquiring, comparing, digesting, and assimilating of experience. Here again is the mystery of generation repeated.","The first in time and the first in importance of the influences upon the mind is that of nature. Every day, the sun; and after sunset, night and her stars. Ever the winds blow; ever the grass grows.","But what is classification but the perceiving that these objects are not chaotic, and are not foreign, but have a law which is also the law of the human mind?","The worst feature of this double consciousness is, that the two lives, of the understanding and of the soul, which we lead, reallyshow very little relation to each other; never meet and measure each other: one prevails now, all buzz and din; and the other prevails then, all infinitude and paradise; and, with the progress of life, the two discover no greater disposition to reconcile themselves.","The Transcendentalist adopts the whole connection of spiritual doctrine. He believes in miracle, in the perpetual openness of thehuman mind to new influx of light and power; he believes in inspiration, and in ecstacy.","Be sure then to read no mean books. Shun the spawn of the press on the gossip of the hour. Do not read what you shall learn, without asking, in the street and the train.","Let us not be too much acquainted. I would have a man enter his house through a hall filled with heroic and sacred sculptures, that he might not want the hint of tranquillity and self-poise.","Really, all things and persons are related to us, but according to our nature, they act on us not at once, but in succession, andwe are made aware of their presence one at a time. All persons, all things which we have known, are here present, and many more than we see; the world is full.","It is said, no man can write but one book; and if a man have a defect, it is apt to leave its impression on all his performances.","Expediency of literature, reason of literature, lawfulness of writing down a thought, is questioned; much is to say on both sides,and, while the fight waxes hot, thou, dearest scholar, stick to thy foolish task, add a line every hour, and between whiles add a line.","Men are born to write. The gardener saves every slip, and seed, and peach-stone: his vocation is to be a planter of plants. Not less does the writer attend his affair. Whatever he beholds or experiences, comes to him as a model, and sits for its picture. He counts it all nonsense that they say, that some things are undescribable. He believes that all that can be thought can be written, first or last; and he would report the Holy Ghost, or attempt it.","In the learned journal, in the influential newspaper, I discern no form; only some irresponsible shadow; oftener some monied corporation, or some dangler, who hopes, in the mask and robes of his paragraph, to pass for somebody. But through every clause and part of speech of the right book I meet the eyes of the most determined men; his force and terror inundate every word: the commas and dashes are alive; so that the writing is athletic and nimble,--can go far and live long.","In strict science, all persons underlie the same condition of an infinite remoteness. Shall we fear to cool our love by mining forthe metaphysical foundation of this elysian temple? Shall I not be as real as the things I see? If I am, I shall not fear to know them for what they are.","I am present at the sowing of the seed of the world. With a geometry of sunbeams, the soul lays the foundations of nature.","Is not prayer also a study of truth,--a sally of the soul into the unfound infinite? No man ever prayed heartily, without learningsomething. But when a faithful thinker, resolute to detach every object from personal relations, and see it in the light of thought, shall, at the same time, kindle science with the fire of the holiest affections, then will God go forth anew into creation.","The difference between the actual and the ideal force of man is happily figured in by the schoolmen, in saying, that the knowledgeof man is an evening knowledge, vespertina cognitio, but that of God is a morning knowledge, matutina cognitio.","A fact is the end or last issue of spirit. The visible creation is the terminus or the circumference of the invisible world.","When I behold a rich landscape, it is less to my purpose to recite correctly the order and superposition of the strata, than to know why all thought of multitude is lost in a tranquil sense of unity.","The shows of the day, the dewy morning, the rainbow, mountains, orchards in blossom, stars, moonlight, shadows in still water, andthe like, if too eagerly hunted, become shows merely, and mock us with their unreality.","We live in a system of approximations. Every end is prospective of some other end, which is also temporary; a round and final success nowhere. We are encamped in nature, not domesticated.","By degrees we may come to know the primitive sense of the permanent objects of nature, so that the world shall be to us an open book, and every form significant of its hidden life and final cause.","The wheels and springs of man are all set to the hypothesis of the permanence of nature. We are not built like a ship to be tossed, but like a house to stand.","In my utter impotence to test the authenticity of the report of my senses, to know whether the impressions they make on me correspond with outlying objects, what difference does it make, whether Orion is up there in heaven, or some god paints the image in the firmament of the soul?","Nature avenges herself speedily on the hard pedantry that would chain her waves. She is no literalist. Every thing must be taken genially, and we must be at the top of our condition, to understand any thing rightly.","It is a mischievous notion that we are come late into nature; that the world was finished a long time ago. As the world was plastic and fluid in the hands of God, so it is ever to so much of his attributes as we bring to it. To ignorance and sin, it is flint. They adapt to themselves to it as they may; but in proportion as a man has anything in him divine, the firmament flows before him and takes his signet and form.","I learn immediately from any speaker how much he has already lived, through the poverty or the splendor of his speech. Life lies behind us as the quarry from whence we get tiles and copestones for the masonry of today. This is the way to learn grammar. Colleges and books only copy the language which the field and the work-yard made.","There is no doctrine of the Reason which will bear to be taught by the Understanding.","All things are known to the soul.","If we will not interfere with our thought, but will act entirely, or see how the thing stands in God, we know the particular thing, and every thing, and every man.","But also the constituency determines the vote of the representative. He is not only representative, but participant. Like can onlybe known by like. The reason why he knows about them is, that he is of them; he has just come out of nature, or from being a part of the thing.","Man is made of the same atoms the world is, he shares the same impressions, predispositions, and destiny. When his mind is illuminated, when his heart is kind, he throws himself joyfully into the sublime order, and does, with knowledge, what the stones do by structure.","It is not an arbitrary \\"decree of God,\\" but in the nature of man, that a veil shuts down on the facts of to-morrow; for the soul will not have us read any other cipher than that of cause and effect. By this veil, which curtains events, it instructs the children of men to live in to-day.","I now require this of all pictures, that they domesticate me, not that they dazzle me. Pictures must not be too picturesque. Nothing astonishes men so much as common-sense and plain dealing. All great actions have been simple, and all great pictures are.","It never was in the power of any man or any community to call the arts into being. They come to serve his actual wants, never to please his fancy.","The highest praise we can attribute to any writer, painter, sculptor, builder, is, that he actually possessed the thought or feeling with which he has inspired us.","Herein is the explanation of the analogies, which exist in all the arts. They are the re-appearance of one mind, working in many materials to many temporary ends. Raphael paints wisdom, Handel sings it, Phidias carves it, Shakspeare writes it, Wren builds it, Columbus sails it, Luther preaches it, Washington arms it, Watt mechanizes it. Painting was called \\"silent poetry,\\" and poetry \\"speaking painting.\\" The laws of each art are convertible into the laws of every other.","I have heard that stiff people lose something of their awkwardness under high ceilings, and in spacious halls. I think, sculptureand painting have an effect to teach us manners, and abolish hurry.","But in every constitution some large degree of animal vigor is necessary as material foundation for the higher qualities of the art.","Think me not unkind and rude\\nThat I walk alone in grove and glen;\\nI go to the god of the wood\\nTo fetch his word to men.","The most attractive class of people are those who are powerful obliquely, and not by the direct stroke: men of genius, but not yetaccredited: one gets the cheer of their light, without paying too great a tax.","Society is the stage on which manners are shown; novels are the literature. Novels are the journal or record of manners; and the new importance of these books derives from the fact, that the novelist begins to penetrate the surface, and treat this part of life more worthily.","We must not inquire too curiously into the absolute value of literature. Enough that it amuses and exercises us. At least it leaves us where we were. It names things, but does not add things.","Society has really no graver interest than the well-being of the literary class.","The permanence of all books is fixed by no effort friendly or hostile, but by their own specific gravity, or the intrinsic importance of their contents to the constant mind of man.","Our day of dependence, our long apprenticeship to the learning of other lands, draws to a close. The millions, that around us arerushing into life, cannot always be fed on the sere remains of foreign harvests.","Good criticism is very rare and always precious.","A man should give us a sense of mass.","I cannot find language of sufficient energy to convey my sense of the sacredness of private integrity. All men, all things, the state, the church, yea the friends of the heart are phantasms and unreal beside the sanctuary of the heart. With so much awe, with so much fear, let it be respected.","Poverty demoralizes. A man in debt is so far a slave; and Wall-street thinks it easy for a millionaire to be a man of his word, aman of honor, but, that, in failing circumstances, no man can be relied on to keep his integrity.","Whatever events in progress shall disgust men with cities, and infuse into them the passion for country life, and country pleasures, will render a service to the whole face of this continent, and will further the most poetic of all the occupations of real life, the bringing out by art the native but hidden graces of the landscape.","The cities drain the country of the best part of its population: the flower of the youth, of both sexes, goes into the towns, andthe country is cultivated by a so much inferior class. The land,--travel a whole day together,--looks poverty-stricken, and the buildings plain and poor.","The democrat is a young conservative; the conservative is an old democrat. The aristocrat is the democrat ripe, and gone to seed,--because both parties stand on the one ground of the supreme value of property, which one endeavors to get, and the other to keep.","Whilst the rights of all as persons are equal, in virtue of their access to reason, their rights in property are very unequal. Oneman owns his clothes, and another owns a country.","Personal rights, universally the same, demand a government framed on the ratio of the census: property demands a government framedon the ratio of owners and of owning.","The whole constitution of property on its present tenures, is injurious, and its influence on persons deteriorating and degrading.","A scholar does not wish to be always pumping his brains; he wants gossips.","Intellectual tasting of life will not supersede muscular activity. If a man should consider the nicety of the passage of a piece of bread down his throat, he would starve.","We hear eagerly every thought and word quoted from an intellectual man. But in his presence our own mind is roused to activity, and we forget very fast what he says.","The scholar may lose himself in schools, in words, and become a pedant; but when he comprehends his duties, he above all men is arealist, and converses with things.","The society of the energetic class, in their friendly and festive meetings, is full of courage, and of attempts, which intimidatethe pale scholar.","A man of thought must feel the thought that is parent of the universe: that the masses of nature do undulate and flow.","When the literary class betray a destitution of faith, it is not strange that society should be disheartened and sensualized by unbelief.","The scholar was not raised by the sacred thoughts amongst which he dwelt, but used them to selfish ends. He was a profane person,and became a showman, turning his gifts to marketable use, and not to his own sustenance and growth. It was found that the intellect could be independently developed, that is, in separation from the man, as any single organ can be invigorated, and the result was monstrous.","Lovers should guard their strangeness. If they forgive too much, all slides into confusion and meanness.","We must be lovers, and at once the impossible becomes possible.","The aspect of nature is devout. Like the figure of Jesus, she stands with bended head, and hands folded upon the breast. The happiest man is he who learns from nature the lesson of worship.","I appeal now to the convictions of the communicants, and ask such persons whether they have not been occasionally conscious of a painful confusion of thought between the worship due to God and the commemoration due to Christ.","I am not so foolish as to declaim against forms. Forms are as essential as bodies; but to exalt particular forms, to adhere to oneform a moment after it is outgrown, is unreasonable, and it is alien to the spirit of Christ.","Labor is God\'s education.","The plays of children are nonsense, but very educative nonsense. So it is with the largest and solemnest things, with commerce, government, church, marriage, and so with the history of every man\'s bread, and the ways by which he is to come by it.","As the farmer casts into the ground the finest ears of his grain, the time will come when we too shall hold nothing back, but shall eagerly convert more than we now possess into means and powers, when we shall be willing to sow the sun and the moon for seeds.","The trail of the serpent reaches into all the lucrative professions and practices of man. Each has its own wrongs. Each finds a tender and very intelligent conscience a disqualification for success. Each requires of the practitioner a certain shutting of the eyes, a certain dapperness and compliance, an acceptance of customs, a sequestration from the sentiments of generosity and love, a compromise of private opinion and lofty integrity.","At present, man applies to nature but half his force. He works on the world with his understanding alone. He lives in it, and masters it by a penny-wisdom; and he that works most in it, is but a half-man, and whilst his arms are strong and his digestion good, his mind is imbruted, and he is a selfish savage.","The one prudence in life is concentration; the one evil is dissipation: and it makes no difference whether our dissipations are coarse or fine; property and its cares, friends and a social habit, or politics, or music, or feasting. Everything is good which takes away one plaything and delusion more, and drives us home to add one stroke of faithful work.","The common experience is, that the man fits himself as well as he can to the customary details of that work or trade he falls into, and tends it as a dog turns a spit. Then he is part of the machine he moves; the man is lost.","Foolish, whenever you take the meanness and formality of that thing you do, instead of converting it into the obedient spiracle ofyour character and aims.","Man is not a farmer, or a professor, or an engineer, but he is all. Man is priest, and scholar, and statesman, and producer, and soldier.","There is virtue yet in the hoe and the spade, for learned as well as for unlearned hands. And labor is everywhere welcome; alwayswe are invited to work.","The people know that they need in their representative much more than talent, namely, the power to make his talent trusted.","Fear is cruel and mean. The political reigns of terror have been reigns of madness and malignity,--a total perversion of opinion;society is upside down, and its best men are thought too bad to live.","A good deal of our politics is physiological.","Although knaves win in every political struggle, although society seems to be delivered over from the hands of one set of criminals into the hands of another set of criminals, as fast as the government is changed, and the march of civilization is a train of felonies, yet, general ends are somehow answered.","Senators and presidents have climbed so high with pain enough, not because they think the place specially agreeable, but as an apology for real worth, and to vindicate their manhood in our eyes. This conspicuous chair is their compensation to themselves for being of a poor, cold, hard nature.","A party is perpetually corrupted by personality.","Meantime the education of the general mind never stops. The reveries of the true and simple are prophetic. What the tender poeticyouth dreams, and prays, and paints today, but shuns the ridicule of saying aloud, shall presently be the resolutions of public bodies, then shall be carried as grievance and bill of rights through conflict and war, and then shall be triumphant law and establishment for a hundred years, until it gives place, in turn, to new prayers and pictures.","We might as easily reprove the east wind, or the frost, as a political party, whose members, for the most part, could give no account of their position, but stand for the defence of those interests in which they find themselves.","Jesus and Shakespeare are fragments of the soul, and by love I conquer and incorporate them in my own conscious domain. His virtue,--is not that mine? His wit,--if it cannot be made mine, it is not wit.","Romeo, of dead, should be cut up into little stars to make the heavens fine. Life, with this pair, has no other aim, asks no more,than Juliet,--than Romeo.","Shakespeare will never be made by the study of Shakespeare.","Could Shakespeare give a theory of Shakespeare?","If we tire of the saints, Shakspeare is our city of refuge.","Shakespeare carries us to such a lofty strain of intelligent activity, as to suggest a wealth which beggars his own; and we then feel that the splendid works which he has created, and which in other hours we extol as a sort of self-existent poetry, take no stronger hold of real nature than the shadow of a passing traveller on the rock. The inspiration which uttered itself in Hamlet and Lear could utter things as good from day to day, for ever.","If I could put my hand on the north star, would it be as beautiful? The sea is lovely, but when we bathe in it the beauty forsakesall the near water. For the imagination and senses cannot be gratified at the same time.","Whatever appeals to the imagination, by transcending the ordinary limits of human ability, wonderfully encourages and liberates us.","Nothing can be colder than his head, when the lightnings of his imagination are playing in the sky.","We are imprisoned in life in the company of persons powerfully unlike us.","Underneath the inharmonious and trivial particulars, is a musical perfection, the Ideal journeying always with us, the heaven without rent or seam.","Nature turns all malfaisance to good.","All things are flowing, even those that seem immovable. The adamant is always passing into smoke. The plants imbibe the materialswhich they want from the air and the ground. They burn, that is, exhale and decompose their own bodies into the air and earth again. The animal burns, or undergoes the like perpetual consumption. The earth burns, the mountains burn and decompose, slower, but incessantly.","Nature does not cocker us: we are children, not pets: she is not fond: everything is dealt to us without fear or favor, after severe universal laws.","Genius is the naturalist or geographer of the supersensible regions, and draws their map; and, by acquainting us with new fields of activity, cools our affection for the old. These are at once accepted as the reality, of which the world we have conversed with is the show.","Where the heart is, there the muses, there the gods sojourn, and not in any geography of fame. Massachusetts, Connecticut River, and Boston Bay, you think paltry places, and the ear loves names of foreign and classic topography. But here we are; and, if we tarry a little, we may come to learn that here is best. See to it, only, that thyself is here;--and art and nature, hope and fate, friends, angels, and the Supreme Being, shall not absent from the chamber where thou sittest.","The soul answers never by words, but by the thing itself that is inquired after.","Therefore all just persons are satisfied with their own praise. They refuse to explain themselves, and are content that new actions should do them that office. They believe that we communicate without speech, and above speech, and that no right action of ours is quite unaffecting to our friends, at whatever distance; for the influence of action is not to be measured by miles.","Show me a man who has acted, and who has not been the victim and slave of his action. What they have done commits and enforces them to do the same again. The first act, which was to be an experiment, becomes a sacrament.","The measure of action is the sentiment from which it proceeds. The greatest action may easily be one of the most private circumstance.","The world leaves no track in space, and the greatest action of man no mark in the vast idea.","It is the dissenter, the theorist, the aspirant, who is quitting this ancient domain to embark on seas of adventure, who engages our interest. Omitting then for the present all notice of the stationary class, we shall find that the movement party divides itself into two classes, the actors, and the students.","We do not want actions, but men; not a chemical drop of water, but rain; the spirit that sheds and showers actions, countless, endless actions.","An action is the perfection and publication of thought. A right action seems to fill the eye, and to be related to all nature.","There are twenty ways of going to a point, and one is the shortest; but set out at once on one. A man who has that presence of mind which can bring to him on the instant all he knows, is worth for action a dozen men who know as much, but can only bring it to light slowly.","We are amphibious creatures, weaponed for two elements, having two sets of faculties, the particular and the catholic.","The life of man is a self-evolving circle, which, from a ring imperceptibly small, rushes on all sides outwards to new and largercircles, and that without end.","Let a man learn to look for the permanent in the mutable and fleeting; let him learn to bear the disappearance of things he was wont to reverence; without losing his reverence; let him learn that he is here, not to work, but to be worked upon; and that, though abyss open under abyss, and opinion displace opinion, all are at last contained in the Eternal Cause.","Idealism sees the world in God. It beholds the whole circle of persons and things, of actions and events, of country and religion,not as painfully accumulated, atom after atom, act after act, in an aged creeping Past, but as one vast picture, which God paints on the instant eternity, for the contemplation of the soul.","Sole and self-commanded works,\\nFears not undermining days,\\nGrows by decays,\\nAnd, by the famous might that lurks\\nIn reaction and recoil,\\nMakes flames to freeze, and ice to boil.","With each divine impulse the mind rends the thin rinds of the visible and finite, and comes out into eternity, and inspires and expires its air. It converses with truths that have always been spoken in the world, and becomes conscious of a closer sympathy with Zeno and Arrian, than with persons in the house.","Silent rushes the swift Lord\\nThrough ruined systems still restored,\\nBroadsowing, bleak and void to bless,\\nPlants with worlds the wilderness;\\nWaters with tears of ancient sorrow\\nApples of Eden ripe to-morrow.\\nHouse and tenant go to ground,\\nLost in God, in Godhead found.","The true thrift is always to spend on the higher plane; to invest and invest, with keener avarice, that he may spend in spiritualcreation, and not in augmenting animal existence. Nor is the man enriched, in repeating the old experiments of animal sensation; nor unless through new powers and ascending pleasures he knows himself by the actual experience of higher good to be already on the way to the highest.","Wild liberty develops iron conscience. Want of liberty, by strengthening law and decorum, stupefies conscience.","The counting-room maxims liberally expounded are laws of the Universe. The merchant\'s economy is a coarse symbol of the soul\'s economy. It is, to spend for power, and not for pleasure.","If there be any man who thinks the ruin of a race of men a small matter, compared with the last decoration and completions of hisown comfort,--who would not so much as part with his ice- cream, to save them from rapine and manacles, I think I must not hesitate to satisfy that man that also his cream and vanilla are safer and cheaper by placing the negro nation on a fair footing than by robbing them.","If any mention was made of homicide, madness, adultery, and intolerable tortures, we would let the church-bells ring louder, the church-organ swell its peal and drown the hideous sound. The sugar they raised was excellent: nobody tasted blood in it.","The subject is said to have the property of making dull men eloquent.","It now appears that the negro race is, more than any other, susceptible of rapid civilization. The emancipation is observed, in the islands, to have wrought for the negro a benefit as sudden as when a thermometer is brought out of the shade into the sun. It has given him eyes and ears.","Give the slave the least elevation of religious sentiment, and he is not slave: you are the slave: he not only in his humility feels his superiority, feels that much deplored condition of his to be a fading trifle, but he makes you feel it too. He is the master.","It is not what talents or genius a man has, but how he is to his talents, that constitutes friendship and character. The man thatstands by himself, the universe stands by him also.","A man is the prisoner of his power. A topical memory makes him an almanac; a talent for debate, disputant; skill to get money makes him a miser, that is, a beggar. Culture reduces these inflammations by invoking the aid of other powers against the dominant talent, and by appealing to the rank of powers. It watches success.","A man must thank his defects, and stand in some terror of his talents. A transcendent talent draws so largely on his forces as tolame him; a defect pays him revenues on the other side.","Open the doors of opportunity to talent and virtue and they will do themselves justice, and property will not be in bad hands.","The uses of travel are occasional, and short; but the best fruit it finds, when it finds it, is conversation; and this is a main function of life.","No doubt, to a man of sense, travel offers advantages. As many languages as he has, as many friends, as many arts and trades, so many times is he a man. A foreign country is a point of comparison, wherefrom to judge his own.","Everything good is on the highway.","It is for want of self-culture that the superstition of Travelling, whose idols are Italy, England, Egypt, retains its fascinationfor all educated Americans.","Do not require a description of the countries towards which you sail. The description does not describe them to you, and to- morrow you arrive there, and know them by inhabiting them.","I am always insincere, as always knowing there are other moods.","If we could have any security against moods! If the profoundest prophet could be holden to his words, and the hearer who is readyto sell all and join the crusade, could have any certificate that to-morrow his prophet shall not unsay his testimony!","As men get on in life, they acquire a love for sincerity, and somewhat less solicitude to be lulled or amused. In the progress ofthe character, there is an increasing faith in the moral sentiment, and a decreasing faith in propositions.","I feel some unwillingness to quit the remembrance of the past. With all the hope of the new I feel that we are leaving the old.","When he has seen, that it is not his, nor any man\'s, but it is the soul which made the world, and that it is all accessible to him, he will know that he, as its minister, may rightfully hold all things subordinate and answerable to it.","The essence of age is intellect. Wherever that appears, we call it old.","For the existing world is not a dream, and cannot with impunity be treated as a dream; neither is it a disease; but it is the ground on which you stand, it is the mother of whom you were born.","The world is the ring of his spells,\\nAnd the play of his miracles.","Character wants room; must not be crowded on by persons, nor be judged from glimpses got in the press of affairs, or on few occasions. It needs perspective, as a great building.","We know who is benevolent, by quite other means than the amount of subscriptions to soup-societies. It is only low merits that canbe enumerated.","Divine persons are character born, or, to borrow a phrase from Napoleon, they are victory organized.","...in the wilderness, I find something more dear and connate than in the streets or villages...in the woods we return to reason and faith.","The secret of success in society is a certain heartiness and sympathy. A man who is not happy in company, cannot find any word in his memory that will fit the occasion; all his information is a little impertinent. A man who is happy there, finds in every turn of the conversation occasions for the introduction of what he has to say. The favorites of society are able men, and of more spirit than wit, who have no uncomfortable egotism, but who exactly fill the hour and the company, contended and contenting.","Character repudiates intellect, yet excites it; and character passes into thought, is published so, and then is ashamed before newflashes of moral worth.","And the glory of character is in affronting the horrors of depravity to draw thence new nobilities of power: as Art lives and thrills in new use and combining of contrasts, and mining into the dark evermore for blacker pits of night.","Cities force growth and make men talkative and entertaining, but they make them artificial. What possesses interest for us is thenatural of each, his constitutional excellence. This is forever a surprise, engaging and lovely; we cannot be satiated with knowing it, and about it; and it is this which the conversation with Nature cherishes and guards.","A man\'s fortunes are the fruit of his character. A man\'s friends are his magnetisms.","Belief and love,--a believing love will relieve us of a vast load of care. O my brothers, God exists. There is a soul at the centre of nature, and over the will of every man, so that none of us can wrong the universe.","There is never a beginning, there is never an end, to the inexplicable continuity of this web of God, but always circular power returning into itself.","The time is coming when all men will see that the gift of God to the soul is not a vaunting, overpowering, excluding sanctity, buta sweet, natural goodness, a goodness like thine and mine, and that so invites thine and mine to be and to grow.","If a man is at heart just, then in so far is he God; the safety of God, the immortality of God, the majesty of God do enter into that man with justice.","Dare to love God without mediator or veil.","I am so much a Unitarian as this: that I believe the human mind can admit but one God, and that every effort to pay religious homage to more than one being goes to take away all right ideas.","In all conversation between two persons, tacit reference is made, as to a third party, to a common nature. That third party or common nature is not social; it is impersonal; is God.","The civility of the world has reached that pitch that their more moral genius is becoming indispensable, and the quality of this race is to be honored for itself.","Ever fresh the broad creation,\\nA divine improvisation,\\nFrom the heart of God proceeds,\\nA single will, a million deeds.","In our definitions, we grope after the spiritual by describing it as invisible. The true meaning of spiritual is real; that law which executes itself, which works without means, and which cannot be conceived as not existing.","An orchard, good tillage, good grounds, seem a fixture, like a gold mine, or a river, to a citizen; but to a large farmer, not much more fixed than the state of the crop.","The secret of the illusoriness is in the necessity of a succession of moods or objects. Gladly we would anchor, but the anchorageis quicksand.","Motion or change, and identity or rest, are the first and second secrets of nature: Motion and Rest. The whole code of her laws may be written on the thumbnail, or the signet of a ring.","All loss, all pain, is particular; the universe remains to the heart unhurt.","Life has no memory. That which proceeds in succession might be remembered, but that which is coexistent, or ejaculated from a deeper cause, as yet far from being conscious, knows not its own tendency.","If I quake, what matters it what I quake at? Our proper vice takes form in one or another shape, according to the sex, age, or temperament of the person, and, if we are capable of fear, will readily find terrors.","Tis weak and vicious people who cast the blame on Fate. The right use of Fate is to bring up our conduct to the loftiness of nature.","The element running through entire nature, which we popularly call Fate, is known to us as limitation. Whatever limits us, we callFate.","Our condition as men is risky and ticklish enough. One can not be sure of himself and his fortune an hour, but he may be whisked off into some pitiable or ridiculous plight.","In spite of Virtue and the Muse,\\nNemesis will have her dues,\\nAnd all our struggles and our toils\\nTighter wind the giant coils.","It is a capital blunder; as you discover, when another man recites his charities.","Love should make joy; but our benevolence is unhappy. Our Sunday-schools, and churches, and pauper-societies are yokes to the neck. We pain ourselves to please nobody.","Every young man is prone to be misled by the suggestions of his own ill-founded ambition which he mistakes for the promptings of asecret genius, and thence dreams of unrivaled greatness.","It is said that when manners are licentious, a revolution is always near: the virtue of woman being the main girth and bandage ofsociety; because a man will not lay up an estate for children any longer than whilst he believes them to be his own.","In certain men digestion and sex absorb the vital force, and the stronger these are, the individual is so much weaker. The more ofthese drones perish, the better for the hive.","Why should all virtue work in one and the same way? Why should all give dollars? It is very inconvenient to us country folk, and we do not think any good will come of it. We have not dollars; merchants have; let them give them. Farmers will give corn; poets will sing; women will sew; laborers will lend a hand; the children will bring flowers.","Is it not manifest that our academic institutions should have a wider scope; that they should not be timid and keep the ruts of the last generation, but that wise men thinking for themselves and heartily seeking the good of mankind, and counting the cost of innovation, should dare to arouse the young to a just and heroic life; that the moral nature should be addressed in the school-room, and children should be treated as the high-born candidates of truth and virtue?","A third felicity of age is that it has found expression. The youth suffers not only from ungratified desires, but from powers untried, and from a picture in his mind of a career which has as yet no outward reality. He is tormented with the want of correspondence between things and thoughts.","Colleges, in like manner, have their indispensable office,--to teach elements. But they can only highly serve us, when they aim not to drill, but to create; when they gather from far every ray of various genius to their hospitable halls, and, by the concentrated fires, set the hearts of their youth on flame.","No man can quite emancipate himself from his age and country, or produce a model in which the education, the religion, the politics, usages, and arts, of his times shall have no share.","Who heeds the waste abyss of possibility? The ocean is everywhere the same, but it has no character until seen with the shore or the ship.","Since everything in nature answers to a moral power, if any phenomenon remains brute and dark, it is that the corresponding faculty in the observer is not yet active.","My life is superficial, takes no root in the deep world; I ask, When shall I die, and be relieved of the responsibility of seeinga Universe which I do not use? I wish to exchange this flash-of-lightning faith for continuous daylight, this fever-glow for a benign climate.","Yourself a newborn bard of the Holy Ghost, cast behind you all conformity, and acquaint men at first hand with Deity.","I find nothing healthful or exalting in the smooth conventions of society. I do not like the close air of saloons. I begin to suspect myself to be a prisoner, though treated with all this courtesy and luxury. I pay a destructive tax in my conformity.","I hope in these days we have heard the last of conformity and consistency. Let the words be gazetted and ridiculous henceforward.Instead of the gong for dinner, let us hear a whistle from the Spartan fife.","We pray to be conventional. But the wary Heaven takes care you shall not be, if there is anything good in you. Dante was very badcompany, and was never invited to dinner.","Every act of the man inscribes itself in the memories of his fellows, and in his own manners and face. The air is full of sounds;the sky, of tokens; the ground is all memoranda and signatures; and every object covered over with hints, which speak to the intelligent.","But I shall hear without pain, that I play the courtier very ill, and talk of that which I do not well understand.","I am primarily engaged to myself to be a public servant of all the gods, to demonstrate to all men that there is intelligence andgood will at the heart of all things, and even higher and yet higher leadings. These are my engagements; how can your law further or hinder me in what I shall do to men?","In my dealing with my child, my Latin and Greek, my accomplishments and my money stead me nothing; but as much soul as I have avails. If I am wilful, he sets his will against mine, one for one, and leaves me, if I please, the degradation of beating him by my superiority of strength. But if I renounce my will, and act for the soul, setting that up as umpire between us two, out of his young eyes looks the same soul; he reveres and loves with me.","No performance is worth loss of geniality. \'Tis a cruel price we pay for certain fancy goods called fine arts and philosophy.","The time will come when the evil forms we have known can no more be organized. Man\'s culture can spare nothing, wants all material. He is to convert all impediments into instruments, all enemies into power.","Culture is the suggestion, from certain best thoughts, that a man has a range of affinities through which he can modulate the violence of any master-tones that have a droning preponderance in his scale, and succor him against himself. Culture redresses this imbalance, puts him among equals and superiors, revives the delicious sense of sympathy, and warns him of the dangers of solitude and repulsion.","Society cannot do without cultivated men. As soon as the first wants are satisfied, the higher wants become imperative.","Not out of those, on whom systems of education have exhausted their culture, comes the helpful giant to destroy the old or to build the new, but out of unhandselled savage nature, out of terrible Druids and Berserkirs, come at last Alfred and Shakespeare.","I think that the heroism which at this day would make on us the impression of Epaminondas and Phocion must be that of a domestic conqueror. He who shall bravely and gracefully subdue this Gorgon of Convention and Fashion, and show men how to lead a clean, handsome and heroic life amid the beggarly elements of our cities and villages; whoso shall teach me how to eat my meat and take my repose and deal with men, without any shame following, will restore the life of man to splendor, and make his own name dear to all history.","Let the man stand on his feet. Let religion cease to be occasional; and the pulses of thought that go to the borders of the universe, let them proceed from the bosom of the Household.","The household is a school of power. There, within the door, learn the tragi-comedy of human life.","If you follow the suburban fashion in building a sumptuous- looking house for a little money, it will appear to all eyes as a cheap, dear house.","In every landscape, the point of astonishment is the meeting of the sky and the earth, and that is seen from the first hillock aswell as from the top of the Alleghanies. The stars at night stoop down over the brownest, homeliest common, with all the spiritual magnificence which they shed on the Campagna, or on the marble deserts of Egypt.","The population of the world is a conditional population; these are not the best, but the best that could live in the existing state of soils, gases, animals, and morals: the best that could yet live; there shall be a better, please God.","It is vain to keep a secret from one who has a right to know it. It will tell itself.","The glance is natural magic. The mysterious communication established across a house between two entire strangers, moves all the springs of wonder. The communication by the glance is in the greatest part not subject to the control of the will. It is the bodily symbol of identity with nature. We look into the eyes to know if this other form is another self, and the eyes will not lie, but make a faithful confession what inhabitant is there.","The only sin is limitation. As soon as you once come up with a man\'s limitations, it is all over with him. Has he talents? has heenterprise? has he knowledge? It boots not. Infinitely alluring and attractive was he to you yesterday, a great hope, a sea to swim in; now, you have found his shores, found it a pond, and you care not if you never see it again.","There is one mind common to all individual men. Every man is an inlet to the same and to all of the same.","The inmost in due time becomes the outmost.","A man in the view of absolute goodness, adores, with total humility. Every step downward, is a step upward. The man who renounceshimself, comes to himself.","I--this thought which is called I--is the mould into which the world is poured like melted wax.","Freedom is the essence of this faith. It has for its object simply to make men good and wise. Its institutions then should be as flexible as the wants of men. That form out of which the life and suitableness have departed should be as worthless in its eyes as the dead leaves that are falling around us.","We ought to be cautious in taking even the best ascertained opinions and practices of the primitive Church for our own. If it could be satisfactorily shown that they esteemed it authorized and transmitted forever, that does not settle the question for us. We know how inveterately they were attached to their Jewish prejudices, and how often even the influence of Christ failed to enlarge their views. On every other subject succeeding times have learned to form a judgement more in accordance with the spirit of Christianity than was the practice of the early ages.","We must trust infinitely to the beneficent necessity which shines through all laws. Human nature expresses itself in them as characteristically as in statues, or songs, or railroads, and an abstract of the codes of nations would be an abstract of the common conscience.","We legislate against forestalling and monopoly; we would have a common granary for the poor; but the selfishness which hoards thecorn for high prices, is the preventative of famine; and the law of self-preservation is surer policy than any legislation can be.","I remember the thought which occurred to me when some ingenious and spiritual foreigners came to America, was, Have you been victimized in being brought hither?--or, prior to that, answer me this, \\"Are you victimizable?","American mind a wilderness of opportunities.","In this our talking America, we are ruined by our good nature and listening on all sides. This compliance takes away the power ofbeing greatly useful.","I am ready to die out of nature, and be born again into this new yet unapproachable America I have found in the West.","Great country, diminutive minds. America is formless, has no terrible and no beautiful condensation.","The land is the appointed remedy for whatever is false and fantastic in our culture. The continent we inhabit is to be physic andfood for our mind, as well as our body. The land, with its tranquilizing, sanative influences, is to repair the errors of a scholastic and traditional education, and bring us to just relations with men and things.","The rage for road building is beneficent for America, where vast distance is so main a consideration in our domestic politics andtrade, inasmuch as the great political promise of the invention is to hold the Union staunch, whose days already seem numbered by the mere inconvenience of transporting representatives, judges and officers across such tedious distances of land and water.","From Washington, proverbially \\"the city of distances,\\" through all its cities, states, and territories, it is a country of beginnings, of projects, of designs, and expectations.","The things we now esteem fixed shall, one by one, detach themselves, like ripe fruit, from our experience, and fall. The wind shall blow them none knows whither.","Humility is the secret of the wise.","The enthusiast always finds the master, the masters, whom he seeks. Always genius seeks genius, desires nothing so much as to be a pupil and to find those who can lend it aid to perfect itself.","The longer we live the more we must endure the elementary existence of men and women; and every brave heart must treat society asa child, and never allow it to dictate.","For, the advantages which fashion values, are plants which thrive in very confined localities, in a few streets, namely. Out of this precinct, they go for nothing; are of no use in the farm, in the forest, in the market, in war, in the nuptial society, in the literary or scientific circle, at sea, in friendship, in the heaven of thought or virtue.","If I should go out of church whenever I hear a false statement I could never stay there five minutes. But why come out? The streetis as false as the church, and when I get to my house, or to my manners, or to my speech, I have not got away from the lie.","The wise and just man will always feel that he stands on his own feet; that he imparts strength to the state, not receives security from it; and if all went down, he and such as he would quite easily combine in a new and better constitution.","The cheapness of man is every day\'s tragedy. It is as real a loss that others should be low, as that we should be low; for we musthave a society.","And in cases where profound conviction has been wrought, the eloquent man is he who is no beautiful speaker, but who is inwardly drunk with a certain belief. It agitates and tears him, and perhaps almost bereaves him of the power of articulation.","The child realizes to every man his own earliest remembrance, and so supplies a defect in our education, or enables us to live over the unconscious history with a sympathy so tender as to be almost personal experience.","The world of men show like a comedy without laughter: populations, interests, government, history; \'t is all toy figures in a toyhouse.","There is nothing but is related to us, nothing that does not interest us,--kingdom, college, tree, horse, or iron show,--the rootsof all things are in man.","Man is the dwarf of himself.","For, rightly, every man is a channel through which heaven floweth, and, whilst I fancied I was criticising him, I was censuring orrather terminating my own soul.","The sea is masculine, the type of active strength. Look, what egg-shells are drifting all over it, each one, like ours, filled with men in ecstasies of terror, alternating with cockney conceit, as the sea is rough or smooth. Is this sad-colored circle an eternal cemetery?","Very few of our race can be said to be yet finished men. We still carry sticking to us some remains of the preceding inferior quadruped organization. We call these millions men; but they are not yet men. Half-engaged in the soil, pawing to get free, man needs all the music that can be brought to disengage him.","The moral sense is always supported by the permanent interest of the parties. Else, I know not how, in our world, any good would ever get done.","All things are moral. That soul, which within us is a sentiment, outside of us is a law. We feel its inspiration; out there in history we can see its fatal strength.","If thought makes free, so does the moral sentiment. The mixtures of spiritual chemistry refuse to be analyzed.","All things are moral; and in their boundless changes have an unceasing reference to spiritual nature.","I like the silent church before the service begins, better than any preaching. How far off, how cool, how chaste the persons look,begirt each one with a precinct or sanctuary!","An individual is an encloser. Time and space, liberty and necessity, truth and thought, are left at large no longer.","All public facts are to be individualized, all private facts are to be generalized.","All men, in the abstract, are just and good; what hinders them, in the particular, is, the momentary predominance of the finite and individual over the general truth. The condition of our incarnation in a private self, seems to be, a perpetual tendency to prefer the private law, to obey the private impulse, to the exclusion of the law of the universal being.","The gentleman is a man of truth, lord of his own actions, and expressing that lordship in his behavior, not in any manner dependent and servile either on persons, or opinions, or possessions.","The tendencies of the times favor the idea of self-government, and leave the individual, for all code, to the rewards and penalties of his own constitution, which work with more energy than we believe, whilst we depend on artificial restraints.","We early arrive at the great discovery that there is one mind common to all individual men: that what is individual is less than what is universalthat error, vice and disease have their seat in the superficial or individual nature.","The private life of one man shall be a more illustrious monarchy,--more formidable to its enemy, more sweet and serene in its influence to its friend, than any kingdom in history. For a man, rightly viewed, comprehendeth the particular natures of all men.","Now every one must do after his kind, be he asp or angel, and these must.","In daily life what distinguishes the master is the using those materials he has, instead of looking about for what are more renowned, or what others have used well.","For splendor, there must somewhere be rigid economy. That the head of the house may go brave, the members must be plainly clad, and the town must save that the State may spend.","The highest end of government is the culture of men.","Hence, the less government we have, the better,--the fewer laws, and the less confided power. The antidote to this abuse of formalGovernment, is, the influence of private character, the growth of the Individual; the appearance of the principal to supersede the proxy; the appearance of the wise man, of whom the existing government, is, it must be owned, but a shabby imitation.","Miracle comes to the miraculous, not to the arithmetician.","Nature is upheld by antagonism.","Though your views are in straight antagonism to theirs, assume an identity of sentiment, assume that you are saying precisely thatwhich all think, and in the flow of wit and love roll out your paradoxes in solid column, with not the infirmity of a doubt.","The eyes of men converse as much as their tongues, with the advantage that the ocular dialect needs no dictionary, but is understood all the world over.","As we refine, our checks become finer. If we rise to spiritual culture, the antagonism takes a spiritual form.","But there are higher secrets of culture, which are not for the apprentices, but for proficients. These are lessons only for the brave. We must know our friends under ugly masks. The calamities are our friends.","No institution will be better than the institutor.","I think all men know better than they do; know that the institutions we so volubly commend are go-carts and baubles; but they darenot trust their presentiments.","You cannot institute, without peril of charlatanism.","We are adapted to infinity. We are hard to please, and love nothing which ends: and in nature is no end; but every thing, at the end of one use, is lifted into a superior, and the ascent of these things climbs into daemonic and celestial natures.","But a compassion for that which is not and cannot be useful and lovely, is degrading and futile.","The best nations are those most widely related; and navigation, as effecting a world-wide mixture, is the most potent advancer ofnations.","Fashion, though in a strange way, represents all manly virtue. It is virtue gone to seed: it is a kind of posthumous honor. It does not often caress the great, but the children of the great: it is a hall of the Past.","Wise men read very sharply all your private history in your look and gait and behavior. The whole economy of nature is bent on expression. The tell-tale body is all tongues. Men are like Geneva watches with crystal faces which expose the whole movement.","There will always be in society certain persons who are mercuries of its approbation, and whose glance will at any time determinefor the curious their standing in the world. These are the chamberlains of the lesser gods. Accept their coldness as an omen of grace with the loftier deities, and allow them all their privilege.","How much better when the whole land is a garden, and the people have grown up in the bowers of a paradise.","The world globes itself in a drop of dew.","The stars awaken a certain reverence, because though always present, they are inaccessible.","Each particle is a microcosm, and faithfully renders the likeness of the world.","Cities give not the human senses room enough. We go out daily and nightly to feed the eyes on the horizon, and require so much scope, just as we need water for our bath.","Beware of too much good staying in your hand. It will fast corrupt and worm worms. Pay it away quickly in some sort.","The vulgar call good fortune that which really is produced by the calculations of genius.","The best conversation is rare. Society seems to have agreed to treat fictions as realities, and realities as fictions; and the simple lover of truth, especially if on very high grounds, as a religious or intellectual seeker, finds himself a stranger and alien.","Life is very narrow. Bring any club or company of intelligent men together again after ten years, and if the presence of some penetrating and calming genius could dispose them to frankness, what a confession of insanities would come up!","A man is reputed to have thought and eloquence; he cannot, for all that, say a word to his cousin or his uncle. They accuse his silence with as much reason as they would blame the insignificance of a dial in the shade. In the sun it will mark the hour. Among those who enjoy his thought, he will regain his tongue.","Conversation is an evanescent relation,--no more.","In all things I would have the island of a man inviolate. Let us sit apart as the gods, talking from peak to peak all round Olympus. No degree of affection need invade this religion.","He only is rich who owns the day.","Let us learn to live coarsely, dress plainly, and lie hard. The least habit of dominion over the palate has certain good effects not easily estimated.","Converse with a mind that is grandly simple, and literature looks like word-catching. The simplest utterances are worthiest to bewritten, yet are they so cheap, and so things of course, that, in the infinite riches of the soul, it is like gathering a few pebbles off the ground, or bottling a little air in a phial, when the whole earth and the whole atmosphere are ours.","The reason of idleness and of crime is the deferring of our hopes. Whilst we are waiting, we beguile the time with jokes, with sleep, with eating, and with crimes.","Our moods do not believe in each other.","We are such lovers of self-reliance, that we excuse in a man many sins, if he will show us a complete satisfaction in his position, which asks no leave to be, of mine, or any man\'s good opinion.","But hospitality must be for service, and not for show, or it pulls down the host. The brave soul rates itself too high to value itself by the splendor of its table and draperies. It gives what it hath, and all it hath, but its own majesty can lend a better grace to bannocks and fair water than belong to city feasts.","The rule for hospitality and Irish \\"help,\\" is, to have the same dinner every day throughout the year. At last, Mrs. O\'Shaughnessylearns to cook it to a nicety, the host learns to carve it, and the guests are well served.","Rude poets of the tavern hearth,\\nsquandering your unquoted mirth,\\nwhich keeps the ground, and never soars,\\nwhile jake retorts, and reuben roars;\\ntough and screaming, as birch-bark,\\ngoes like bullet to its mark;\\nwhile the solid curse and jeer\\nnever balk the waiting ear.","If we consider what happens in conversation, in reveries, in remorse, in times of passion, in surprises, in the instructions of dreams, wherein often we see ourselves in masquerade,--the droll disguises only magnifying and enhancing a real element, and forcing it on our distinct notice,--we shall catch many hints that will broaden and lighten into knowledge of the secret of nature.","Although this garrulity of advising is born with us, I confess that life is rather a subject of wonder, than of didactics. So muchfate, so much irresistible dictation from temperament and unknown inspiration enter into it, that we doubt we can say anything out of our own experience whereby to help each other.","The maxim of courts is that manner is power.","The world is filled with the proverbs and acts and winkings of a base prudence, which is a devotion to matter, as if we possessedno other faculties than the palate, the nose, the touch, the eye and ear; a prudence which adores the Rule of Three, which never subscribes, which never gives, which seldom lends, and asks but one question of any project,--Will it bake bread?","You cannot give anything to a magnanimous person. After you have served him, he at once puts you in debt by his magnanimity.","The good judge is not he who does hair-splitting justice to every allegation, but who, aiming at substantial justice, rules something intelligible of the guidance of suitors.","The conservative assumes sickness as a necessity, and his social frame is a hospital, his total legislation is for the present distress, a universe in slippers and flannels, with bib and papspoon, swallowing pills and herb-tea.","Teaching is the perpetual end and office of all things. Teaching, instruction is the main design that shines through the sky and earth.","We must leave our pets at home, when we go into the street, and meet men on broad grounds of good meaning and good sense.","There is no event greater in life than the appearance of new persons about our hearth, except it be the progress of the characterwhich draws them.","Egotism is a kind of buckram that gives momentary strength and concentration to men, and seems to be much used in Nature for fabrics in which local and spasmodic energy is required.","The public values the invention more than the inventor does. The inventor knows there is much more and better where this came from.","These arts open great gates of a future, promising to make the world plastic and to lift human life out of its beggary to a god- like ease and power.","Whilst we want cities as the centres where the best things are found, cities degrade us by magnifying trifles.","New York is a sucked orange. All conversation is at an end, when we have discharged ourselves of a dozen personalities, domestic or imported, which make up our American existence.","The city is always recruited from the country. The men in cities who are the centres of energy, the driving-wheels of trade, politics or practical arts, and the women of beauty and genius, are the children or grandchildren of farmers, and are spending the energies which their fathers\' hardy, silent life accumulated in frosty furrows in poverty, necessity and darkness.","In our large cities, the population is godless, materialized,--no bond, no fellow-feeling, no enthusiasm. These are not men, but hungers, thirsts, fevers, and appetites walking. How is it people manage to live on,--so aimless as they are? After their peppercorn aims are gained, it seems as if the lime in their bones alone held them together, and not any worthy purpose.","If the individuals who compose the purest circles of aristocracy in Europe, the guarded blood of centuries, should pass in review,in such manner as that we could, at leisure, and critically inspect their behavior, we might find no gentleman, and no lady; for, although excellent specimens of courtesy and high-breeding would gratify us in the assemblage, in the particulars, we should detect offence. Because, elegance comes of no breeding, but of birth.","Every man is not so much a workman in the world as he is a suggestion of that he should be. Men walk as prophecies of the next age.","This one fact the world hates; that the soul becomes; for that forever degrades the past, turns all riches to poverty, all reputation to a shame, confounds the saint with the rogue, shoves Jesus and Judas equally aside.","Besides, our action on each other, good as well as evil, is so incidental and at random, that we can seldom hear the acknowledgments of any person who would thank us for a benefit, without some shame and humiliation. We can rarely strike a direct stroke, but must be content with an oblique one; we seldom have the satisfaction of yielding a direct benefit, which is directly received.","How shall a man escape from his ancestors, or draw off from his veins the black drop which he drew from his father\'s or mother\'s life?","Every ship is a romantic object, except that we sail in. Embark, and the romance quits our vessel, and hangs on every other sail in the horizon.","Manners are very communicable: men catch them from each other.","I could better eat with one who did not respect the truth or the laws, than with a sloven and unpresentable person. Moral qualities rule the world, but at shorter distances, the senses are despotic.","Manners aim to facilitate life, to get rid of impediments, and bring the man pure to energize. They aid our dealing and conversation, as a railway aids travelling, by getting rid of all avoidable obstructions of the road, and leaving nothing to be conquered but pure space.","A man is but a little thing in the midst of the objects of nature, yet, by the moral quality radiating from his countenance, he may abolish all considerations of magnitude, and in his manners equal the majesty of the world.","It is noticed, that the consideration of the great periods and spaces of astronomy induces a dignity of mind, and an indifferenceto death.","Every man is wanted, and no man is wanted much.","Without looking, then, to those extraordinary social influences which are now acting in precisely this direction, but only at whatis inevitably doing around us, I think we must regard the land as a commanding and increasing power on the citizen, the sanative and Americanizing influence, which promises to disclose new virtues for ages to come.","There is also something excellent in every audience,--the capacity of virtue. They are ready to be beatified.","The eloquence of one stimulates all the rest, some up to the speaking-point, and all others to a degree that makes them good receivers and conductors, and they avenge themselves for their enforced silence by increased loquacity on their return.","Some men love only to talk where they are masters. They like to go to school-girls, or to boys, or into the shops where the sauntering people gladly lend an ear.","The farmer after sacrificing pleasure, taste, freedom, thought, love, to his work, turns out often a bankrupt, like the merchant.This result might well seem astounding. All this drudgery, from cockcrowing to starlight, for all these years, to end in mortgages and the auctioneer\'s flag, and removing from bad to worse. It is time to have the thing looked into, and with a sifting criticism ascertained who is the fool.","Beside all the moral benefit which we may expect from the farmer\'s profession, when a man enters it considerately, this promised the conquering of the soil, plenty, and beyond this, the adorning of the country with every advantage and ornament which labor, ingenuity, and affection for a man\'s home, could suggest.","A farm is a good thing, when it begins and ends with itself, and does not need a salary, or a shop, to eke it out.","I quote another man\'s saying; unluckily, that other withdraws himself in the same way, and quotes me.","A healthy soul stands united with the Just and the True, as the magnet arranges itself with the pole, so that he stands to all beholders like a transparent object betwixt them and the sun, and whoso journeys towards the sun, journeys towards that person. He is thus the medium of the highest influence to all who are not on the same level.","When there is sympathy, there needs but one wise man in a company and all are wise,--so, a blockhead makes a blockhead of his companion. Wonderful power to benumb possesses this brother.","Each man too is a tyrant in tendency, because he would impose his idea on others; and their trick is their natural defence. Jesuswould absorb the race; but Tom Paine or the coarsest blasphemer helps humanity by resisting this exuberance of power.","For, truly speaking, whoever provokes me to a good act or thought has given me a pledge of his fidelity to virtue,--he has come under the bonds to adhere to that cause to which we are jointly attached.","Again, the great number of cultivated men keep each other up to a high standard. The habit of meeting well-read and knowing men teaches the art of omission and selection.","Fashion which affects to be honor, is often, in all men\'s experience, only a ballroom-code.","The poor and the low have their way of expressing the last facts of philosophy as well as you. \\"Blessed be nothing,\\" and \\"The worse things are, the better they are,\\" are proverbs which express the transcendentalism of common life.","A great licentiousness treads on the heels of a reformation.","The history of reform is always identical; it is the comparison of the idea with the fact. Our modes of living are not agreeable to our imagination. We suspect they are unworthy. We arraign our daily employments.","Many a reformer perishes in his removal of rubbish,--and that makes the offensiveness of the class. They are partial; they are notequal to the work they pretend. They lose their way; in the assault on the kingdom of darkness, they expend all their energy on some accidental evil, and lose their sanity and power of benefit.","It is handsomer to remain in the establishment better than the establishment, and conduct that in the best manner, than to make asally against evil by some single improvement, without supporting it by a total regeneration.","The new statement is always hated by the old, and, to those dwelling in the old, comes like an abyss of skepticism.","In the actual world--the painful kingdom of time and place--dwell care, and canker, and fear. With thought, with the ideal, is immortal hilarity, the rose of joy.","As thinkers, mankind has ever divided into two sects, Materialists and Idealists; the first class founding on experience, the second on consciousness; the first class beginning to think from the data of the senses, the second class perceive that the senses are not final and say, The senses give us representations of things, but what are the things themselves, they cannot tell. The materialist insists on facts, on history, on the force of circumstances and the animal wants of man; the idealists on the power of Thought and Will, on inspiration, on miracle, on individual culture.","Every materialist will be an idealist; but an idealist can never go backward to be a materialist.","Society is frivolous, and shreds its day into scraps, its conversation into ceremonies and escapes.","If you meet a sectary, or a hostile partisan, never recognize the dividing lines; but meet on what common ground remains,--if onlythat the sun shines, and the rain rains for both; the area will widen very fast, and ere you know it the boundary mountains, on which the eye had fastened, have melted into air.","A man is a beggar who only lives to the useful, and, however he may serve as a pin or rivet in the social machine, cannot be saidto have arrived at self-possession.","I am ashamed to see what a shallow village tale our so-called History is. How many times must we say Rome, and Paris, and Constantinople! What does Rome know of rat and lizard? What are Olympiads and Consulates to these neighboring systems of being? Nay, what food or experience or succor have they for the Esquimaux seal-hunter, or the Kanaka in his canoe, for the fisherman, the stevedore, the porter?","When private men shall act with original views, the lustre will be transferred from the actions of kings to those of gentlemen.","We owe to genius always the same debt, of lifting the curtain from the common, and showing us that divinities are sitting disguised in the seeming gang of gypsies and peddlars.","Is not, indeed, every man a student, and do not all things exist for the student\'s behoof?","The philanthropists inquire whether Transcendentalism does not mean sloth: they had as lief hear that their friend is dead, as that he is a Transcendentalist; for then is he paralyzed, and can never do anything for humanity.","We fetch fire and water, run about all day among the shops and markets, and get our clothes and shoes made and mended, and are thevictims of these details, and once in a fortnight we arrive perhaps at a rational moment.","All forms of government symbolize an immortal government, common to all dynasties and independent of numbers, perfect where two men exist, perfect where there is only one man.","Housekeeping is not beautiful; it cheers and raises neither the husband, the wife, nor the child; neither the host nor the guest;it oppresses women. A house kept to the end of prudence is laborious without joy; a house kept to the end of display is impossible to all but a few women, and their success is dearly bought.","The piety of the Hebrew prophets purges their grossness. The circumcision is an example of the power of poetry to raise the low and offensive.","A man in a cave or in a camp, a nomad, will die with no more estate than the wolf or the horse leaves.","I look on Sculpture as history. I do not think the Apollo and the Jove impossible in flesh and blood. Every trait the artist recorded in stone, he had seen in life, and better than his copy.","The god or hero of the sculptor is always represented in a transition from that which is representable to the senses, to that which is not.","A right rule for a club would be, Admit no man whose presence excludes any one topic. It requires people who are not surprised andshocked, who do and let do, and let be, who sink trifles, and know solid values, and who take a great deal for granted.","It is always a practical difficulty with clubs to regulate the laws of election so as to exclude peremptorily every social nuisance. Nobody wishes bad manners. We must have loyalty and character.","A sturdy lad from New Hampshire or Vermont who in turn tries all the professions, who teams it, farms it, peddles, keeps a school,preaches, edits a newspaper, goes to Congress, buys a township, and so forth, in successive years, and always like a cat falls on his feet, is worth a hundred of these city dolls. He walks abreast with his days and feels no shame in not \\"studying a profession,\\" for he does not postpone his life, but lives already.","Popularity is for dolls.","Everything that is popular, it has been said, deserves the attention of philosophers: and this is for the obvious reason, that although it may not be of any worth in itself, yet it characterizes the people.","Nobody is glad in the gladness of another, and our system is one of war, of an injurious superiority. Every child of the Saxon race is educated to wish to be first. It is our system; and a man comes to measure his greatness by the regrets, envies, and hatreds of his competitors.","It is easy to carp at colleges, and the college, if he will wait for it, will have its own turn. Genius exists there also, but will not answer a call of a committee of the House of Commons. It is rare, precious, eccentric, and darkling.","Oxford is a little aristocracy in itself, numerous and dignified enough to rank with other estates in the realm; and where fame and secular promotion are to be had for study, and in a direction which has the unanimous respect of all cultivated nations.","The university must be retrospective. The gale that gives direction to the vanes on all its towers blows out of antiquity.","What new thoughts are suggested by seeing a face of country quite familiar, in the rapid movement of the rail-road car!","A Gothic cathedral affirms that it was done by us and not done by us.","The Gothic cathedral is a blossoming in stone subdued by the insatiable demand of harmony in man.","To eat bread is one thing; to love the precepts of Christ and resolve to obey them is quite another.","Railroad iron is a magician\'s rod, in its power to evoke the sleeping energies of land and water.","The goof man, in dealing with his people, taxes them with luxury.","In vain produced, all rays return;\\nEvil will bless, and ice will burn.","The true preacher can be known by this, that he deals out to the people his life,--life passed through the fire of thought.","Whenever the pulpit is usurped by a formalist, then is the worshipper defrauded and disconsolate.","We commonly say that the rich man can speak the truth, can afford honesty, can afford independence of opinion and action;--and that is the theory of nobility. But it is the rich man in a true sense, that is to say, not the man of large income and large expenditure, but solely the man whose outlay is less than his income and is steadily kept so.","The lord is the peasant that was,\\nThe peasant is the lord that shall be.","What forests of laurel we bring, and the tears of mankind, to those who stood firm against the opinion of their contemporaries!","The God who made New Hampshire\\nTaunted the lofty land\\nWith little men.","What care though rival cities soar\\nAlong the stormy coast,\\nPenn\'s town, New York, Baltimore,\\nIf Boston knew the most!","I do not speak with any fondness but the language of coolest history, when I say that Boston commands attention as the town whichwas appointed in the destiny of nations to lead the civilization of North America.","My gentleman gives the law where he is; he will outpray saints in chapel, outgeneral veterans in the field, and outshine all courtesy in the hall. He is good company for pirates, and good with academicians; so that it is useless to fortify yourself against him; he has the private entrance to all minds, and I could as easily exclude myself, as him.","Another success is the post-office, with its educating energy augmented by cheapness and guarded by a certain religious sentimentin mankind; so that the power of a wafer or a drop of wax or gluten to guard a letter, as it flies over sea over land and comes to its address as if a battalion of artillery brought it, I look upon as a fine meter of civilization.","But, if we explore the literature of Heroism, we shall quickly come to Plutarch, who is its Doctor and historian. To him we owe the Brasidas, the Dion, the Epaminodas, the Scipio of old, and I must think we are more deeply indebted to him than to all the ancient writers. Each of his \\"Lives\\" is a refutation to the despondency and cowardice of our religious and political theorists. A wild courage, a Stoicism not of the schools, but of the blood, shines in every anecdote, and had given that book immense fame.","The law of nature is alternation for evermore. Each electrical state superinduces the opposite.","The field cannot be well seen from within the field. The astronomer must have his diameter of the earth\'s orbit as a base to fix the parallax of any other star","Conversation in society is found to be on a platform so low as to exclude science, the saint, and the poet.","If we walk in the woods, we must feed mosquitoes.","The progress of religion is steadily to its identity with morals. Strength enters just as much as the moral element prevails.","Not gold, but only man can make a people great and strong; men who, for truth and honor\'s sake, stand fast and suffer long.","Free should be the scholar - free and brave.","The President proclaims war, and those Senators who dissent are not those who know better, but those who can afford to...Democracy becomes a government of bullies tempered by editors.","What is man born for but to be a Reformer, a Remaker of what man has made? A renouncer of lies; a restorer of truth and good? Imitating that great Nature which embossoms us all, and which sleeps no moment on an old past, but every hour repairs herself, yielding us every morning a new day, with every breath a new life?","The vocabulary of an omniscient man would embrace words and images excluded from polite conversation. What would be base, or even obscene, to the obscene, becomes illustrious, spoken in a new connexion of thought.","Passion, though a bad regulator, is a powerful spring. Any absorbing passion has the effect to deliver from the little coils and cares of every day: \'tis the heat which sets our human atoms spinning, overcomes the friction of crossing thresholds, and first addresses in society, and gives us a good start and speed, easy to continue, when once it is begun.","Success to the strongest, who are always, at last, the wisest and best.","Ten percent of people can think, another ten percent of people think that they think, and eighty percent of people would rather die than be made to think.","A good indignation makes an excellent speech.","All ages of belief have been great; all of unbelief have been mean.","The multitude of false churches accredits the true religion.","The test of civilization is the power of drawing the most benefit out of cities.","Henceforth, please God, forever I forego the yolk of men\'s opinions. I will be light-hearted as a bird and live with God. I find him in the bottom of my heart, and I hear continually his voice therein.","Do what you\'re afraid to do.","It seems to be a rule of wisdom never to rely on memory alone.","History - a biography of a few stout and earnest persons","A true man belongs to no other time or place, but is the center of things.","A system-grinder hates the truth.","And dazzling memory revive.Refresh the faded tints, Recut the aged prints, And write my old adventures, with the pen Which, on the first day, drew Upon the tablets blue The dancing Pleiads, and the eternal men.","Society never advances. It recedes as fast on one side as it gains on the other. It undergoes continual changes: it is barbarous, it is civilized, it is rich, it is scientific; but this change is not amelioration. For every thing that is given, something else is taken. Society acquires new arts and loses old instincts.","You\'ve got to be taught to be afraid\\nOf people whose eyes are oddly made\\nAnd people whose skin is a different shade.","Life has a way of demanding that you live it.","Before a leaf-bud has burst, its whole life acts; in the full-blown flower there is no more; in the leafless root there is no less.","Observe how every truth and every error, each a thought of someone\'s mind, clothes itself with societies, houses, cities, language, ceremonies, newspapers","A Judge may be a farmer; but he is not to geld his own pigs.","I have never met a man who was not my superior in some particular.","Give me truths for I am weary of the surfaces.","There is a principle which is the basis of things, which all speech aims to say, and all action to evolve, a simple, quiet, undescribed, undescribable presence, dwelling very peacefully in us, our rightful lord: we are not to do, but to let do; not to work, but to be worked upon.","The teaching of politics is that the Government, which was set for protection and comfort of all good citizens, becomes the principal obstruction and nuisance with which we have to contend... The cheat and bully and malefactor we meet everywhere is the Government.","To the body and mind which have been cramped by noxious work or company, nature is medicinal and restores their tone.","Proverbs are the literature of reason, or the statements of absolute truth, without qualification. Like the sacred books of each nation, they are the sanctuary of its intuitions.","A dilettantism in nature is barren and unworthy. A fop of fields is no better than his brother on Broadway.","The good husband finds method as efficient in the packing of fire-wood in a shed, or in the harvesting of fruits in the cellar, as in Peninsular campaigns or the files of the Department of State.","Examples are cited by soldiers, of men who have seen the cannon pointed, and the fire given to it, and who have stepped aside from he path of the ball. The terrors of the storm are chiefly confined to the parlour and the cabin.","Happy will that house be in which the relations are formed from character; after the highest, and not after the lowest order; the house in which character marries, and not confusion and a miscellany of unavowable motives.","You will think me very pedantic, gentlemen, but holiday though it may be, I have not the smallest interest in any holiday, except as it celebrates real and not pretended joys.","The intellect,-that is miraculous! Who has it, has the talisman: his skin and bones, though they were of the color of night, are transparent, and the everlasting stars shine through, with attractive beams.","To be rich is to have a ticket of admission to the masterworks and chief men of each race. It is to have the sea, by voyaging; to visit the mountains, Niagara, the Nile, the desert, Rome, Paris, Constantinople: to see galleries, libraries, arsenals, manufactories.","Fear, when your friends say to you what you have done well, and say it through; but when they stand with uncertain timid looks of respect and half-dislike, and must suspend their judgement for years to come, you may begin to hope.","Deep insight will always, like Nature, ultimate its thought in a thing.","The stars awaken a certain reverence, because though always present, they are inaccessible; but all natural objects make a kindred impression, when the mind is open to their influence. Nature never wears a mean appearance.","Some will always be above others.","Always maintain your common sense and artful skills, and funnel it all into plain enough dealings.","In imitation is a bit suicide.","If you want a friend you need to be a friend.","If you take in a lie, you must take in all that belongs to it.","The health of the eye demands a horizon.","Walking has the best value as gymnastics of the mind.","Numbers serve to discipline rhetoric. Without them it is too easy to follow flights of fancy, to ignore the world as it is and to remold it nearer the heart\'s desire.","Every mind is different; and the more it is unfolded, the more pronounced is that difference.","Every man is the inlet and may become the outlet of all there is in God.","We have a great deal more kindness than is ever spoken. The whole human family is bathed with an element of love like a fine ether. How many persons we meet in houses, whom we scarcely speak to, whom yet we honor and who honor us! How many we see in the street, or sit with in church, whom though silently, we warmly rejoice to be with! Read the language of these wandering eye-beams. The heart knoweth.","The soul is the perceiver and the revealer of truth.","I suppose you could never explain to the most ingenous molusk that such a creature as a whale existed.","The corruption of man is followed by the corruption of language. ... In due time, the fraud is manifest, and words lose all power to stimulate the understanding or the affections.","A sublime hope cheers ever the faithful heart, that elsewhere, in other regions of the universal powers, souls are now acting, enduring and daring, which can love us, and which we can love.","Do you love me? Means at last do you see the same truth I see? If you do, we are happy together; but when presently one of us passes into the perception of a new truth, we are divorced and the force of all nature cannot hold us to each other.","Each philosopher, each bard, each actor has only done for me, as by a delegate, what one day I can do for myself.","We may be partial, but Fate is not.","To a physician, each man, each woman, is an amplification of one organ.","There is one topic peremptorily forbidden to all well-bred, to all rational mortals, namely, their distempers.","Science is organized knowledge. Wisdom is organized life. Football is four 15-minute quarters. Plus timeouts and commercials.","To be gret is to be misunderstood.","Repose and cheerfulness are the badge of the gentleman - repose in energy. The Greek battle pieces are calm; the heroes, in whatever violent actions engaged, retain a serene aspect.","Find the journey\'s end in every step.","It is better to be a thorn in the side of a friend than an echo.","Your work should be in praise of what you love.","It is only as a man puts off from himself all external support, and stands alone, that I see him to be strong and to prevail.","I cannot marry the facts of William Shakespeare to his verse: Other men had led lives in some sort of keeping with their thought, but this man is in wide contrast.","I read the other day some verses written by an eminent painter which were original and not conventional.","The inquiry leads us to that source, at once the essence of genius, of virtue, and of life, which we call Spontaneity or Instinct.","Human beings cannot endure the geological chaos they encounter under the soil of their own gardens.","We come to our own and would make friends with matter, which the ambitious chatter of the schools would persuade us to despise. We can never part with it; the mind loves its old home: as water to our thirst, so is rock, the ground, to our eyes, and hands, and feet. It is firm water: it is cold flame: what health, what affinity!","I remember an answer which when quite young I was prompted to make a valued adviser who was wont to importune me with the dear old doctrines of the church. On my saying, What have I to do with the sacredness of traditions, if I live wholly from within? my friend suggested, - \\"But these impulses may be from below, not from above.\\" I replied, \'They do not seem to me to be such; but if I am the devil\'s child, I will live then from the devil.\'","Every man\'s condition is a solution in hieroglyph to those inquiries he would put. He acts it as life before he apprehends it as truth.","Others can get in your way temporarily, but only you can get out of your way permanently. Our best thoughts come from others.","A great part of courage is the courage of having done the thing before.","A man is relieved and gay when he has put his heart into his work and done his best; but what he has said or done otherwise shall give him no peace.","The health of the eye seems to demand a horizon. We are never tired, so long as we can see far enough.","Every experiment, by multitudes or by individuals, that has a sensual and selfish aim, will fail.","A man is a god in ruins. When men are innocent, life shall be longer, and shall pass into the immortal, as gently as we awake from dreams.","There are as many pillows of illusion as flakes in a snow-storm. We wake from one dream into another dream.","Every man has his own courage, and is betrayed because he seeks in himself the courage of other persons.","There is more difference in the quality of our pleasures than in the amount.","There is no chance and anarchy in the universe. All is system and gradation. Every god is there sitting in his sphere.","We are a puny and fickle folk. Avarice, hesitation, and following are our diseases.","Revolutions go not backward.","Every spirit makes its house, and we can give a shrewd guess from the house to the inhabitant.","Mysticism is the mistake of an accidental and individual symbol for an universal one.","People disparage knowing and the intellectual life, and urge doing. I am content with knowing, if only I could know.","God screens us evermore from premature ideas.","The method of nature: who could ever analyze it?","The wave of evil washes all our institutions alike.","Every book is a quotation; and every house is a quotation out of all forests, and mines, and stone quarries; and every man is a quotation from all his ancestors.","Every fact is related on one side to sensation, and, on the other, to morals. The game of thought is, on the appearance of one of these two sides, to find the other: given the upper, to find the under side.","Every sweet has its sour; every evil its good.","Happy will the house be in which the relationships are formed from character.","The secret of poetry is never explained,\u2014 is always new. We have not got farther than mere wonder at the delicacy of the touch, and the eternity it inherits. In every house a child that in mere play utters oracles, and knows not that they are such. \'T is as easy as breath. \'T is like this gravity, which holds the Universe together, and none knows what it is.","Let the words be gazetted and ridiculous henceforward.","We pass for what we are.","Every burned book or house enlightens the world; every suppressed or expunged word reverberates through the earth from side to side.","So shall we come to look at the world with new eyes. It shall answer the endless inquiry of the intellect, \u2014 What is truth? and of the affections, \u2014 What is good? by yielding itself passive to the educated Will. ... Build, therefore, your own world. As fast as you conform your life to the pure idea in your mind, that will unfold its great proportions. A correspondent revolution in things will attend the influx of the spirit.","There are books... which rank in our life with parents and lovers and passionate experiences.","Democracy becomes a government of bullies tempered by editors.","Better be a nettle in the side of your friend than his echo.","Everything teaches transition, transference, metamorphosis: therein is human power, in transference, not in creation; & therein is human destiny, not in longevity but in removal. We dive & reappear in new places.","People do not deserve to have good writing, they are so pleased with bad.","A friend may be nature\'s most magnificent creation.","The student is to read history actively and not passively.","I covet truth; beauty is unripe childhood\'s cheat; I leave it behind with the games of youth.","Throw a stone into the stream and the ripples that propagate themselves are the beautiful type of all influence.","I unsettle all things.","Speak your latent conviction. . . Else tomorrow a stranger will say with masterly good sense precisely what we have thought and felt all the time, and we shall be forced to take with shame our own opinion from another.","Let us take our bloated nothingness out of the path of the divine circuits.","Teach that God is, not was; that He speaketh, not spake.","Faith and love are apt to be spasmodic in the best minds: Men live on the brink of mysteries and harmonies into which yet they never enter, and with their hand on the doorlatch they die outside.","Keep your friendships in repair.","Let us be poised, and wise, and our own, today. Let us treat men and women well; treat them as if they were real; perhaps they are.","I am sure of this, that by going much alone a man will get more of a noble courage in thought and word than from all the wisdom that is in books.","Nothing in nature is exhausted in its first use...In God, every end is converted into a new means.","Nothing is at last sacred but the integrity of your own mind. Absolve you to yourself, and you shall have the suffrage of the world.","Tis the good reader that makes the good book; in every book he finds passages which seem confidences or asides hidden from all else and unmistakenly meant for his ear; the profit of books is according to the sensibility of the reader; the profoundest thought or passion sleeps as in a mine, until it is discovered by an equal mind and heart.","Moderation in all things, especially moderation.","There is in nature a parallel unity which corresponds to the unity in the mind and makes it available. This methodizing mind meets no resistance in its attempts. The scattered blocks, with which it strives to form a symmetrical structure, fit. This design following after finds with joy that like design went before. Not only man puts things in a row, but things belong in a row.","The peril of every fine faculty is the delight of playing with it for pride. Talent is commonly developed at the expense of character, and the greater it grows, the more is the mischief. Talent is mistaken for genius, a dogma or system for truth, ambition for greatness, ingenuity for poetry, sensuality for art.","The other terror that scares us from self-trust is our consistency; a reverence for our past act or word, because the eyes of others have no other data for computing our orbit than our past acts, and we are loath to disappoint them.","The roses under my window make no reference to former roses or better ones; they are what they are; they exist with God today. There is no time to them. There is simply the rose; it is perfect in every moment of its existence.","But, if a man would be alone, let him look at the stars. The rays that come from these heavenly worlds, will separate between him and what he touches. One might think the atmosphere was made transparent with this design, to give man, in the heavenly bodies, the perpetual presence of the sublime... But every night come out these envoys of beauty, and light the universe with their admonishing smile.","Prayer that craves a particular commodity\u2014anything less than all good, is vicious. Prayer is the contemplation of the facts of life from the highest point of view. It is the soliloquy of a beholding and jubilant soul. It is the spirit of God pronouncing his works good. But prayer as a means to effect a private end is theft and meanness. It supposes dualism and not unity in nature and consciousness. As soon as the man is at one with God, he will not beg.","The secret of fortune is joy in our hands. Welcome evermore to gods and men is the self-helping man. For him all doors are flung wide. Him all tongues greet, all honors crown, all eyes follow with desire. Our love goes out to him and embraces him because he did not need it.","All men plume themselves on the improvement of society, and no man improves.","Imagination is a very high sort of seeing, which does not come by study, but by the intellect being where and what it sees, by sharing the path, or circuits of things through forms, and so making them translucid to others.","The poet knows that he speaks adequately, then, only when he speaks somewhat wildly.","Not the sun or summer alone, but every hour and season yields its tribute of delight.","God will not make himself manifest to cowards","Music takes us out of the actual and whispers to us dim secrets that startles out wonder as to who we are, and for what, whence, and whereto.","The life of truth is cold.","The sun shines today also.","Not for nothing one face, one character, one fact makes much impression on him, and another none.","Society is a wave. The wave moves onward, but the water of which it is composed does not.","Raphael paints wisdom, Handel sings it, Phidias carves it, Shakespeare writes it, Wren builds it, Columbus sails it, Luther preaches it, Washington arms it, Watt mechanizes it.","Have mountains, and waves, and skies, no significance but what we consciously give them, when we employ them as emblems of our thoughts?","Life is to be lived, not controlled.","Never read any book that is not a year old.","Let the soul be assured that somewhere in the universe it should rejoin its friend, and it would be content and cheerful alone for a thousand years.","So nigh is grandeur to our dust, So near is God to man, When Duty whispers low, \'Thou must,\' The youth whispers, \'I can.","Truly speaking, it is not instruction, but provocation, that I can receive from another soul. What he announces, I must find true in me, or reject; and on his word, or as his second, be he who he may, I can accept nothing.","The escape from all false ties; courage to be what we are; and love of what is simple and beautiful; independence, and cheerful relation, these are the essentials.","We, as we read, must become Greeks, Romans, Turks, priest and king, martyr and executioner; must fasten these images to some reality in our secret experience, or we shall learn nothing rightly.","At times the whole world seems to be in conspiracy to importune you with emphatic trifles. Friend, client, child, sickness, fear, want, charity, all knock at once at thy closet door and say,\u2014\'Come out unto us.\' But keep thy state; come not into their confusion. The power men possess to annoy me I give them by a weak curiosity. No man can come near me but through my act.","Men do what is called a good action, as some piece of courage or charity, much as they would pay a fine in expiation of daily non-appearance on parade. Their works are done as an apology or extenuation of their living in the world. I do not wish to expiate, but to live. My life is not an apology, but a life.","The sinew and heart of man seem to be drawn out, and we are become timorous desponding whimperers. We are afraid of truth, afraid of fortune, afraid of death, and afraid of each other.","But if a man would be alone, let him look at the stars. The rays that come from those heavenly worlds, will separate between him and vulgar things.","Heaven walks among us ordinarily muffled in such triple or tenfold disguises that the wisest are deceived and no one suspects the days to be gods.","Solitude is impractical and yet society is fatal.","There is no privacy that cannot be penetrated. No secret can be kept in the civilized world. Society is a masked ball where everyone hides his real character, then reveals it by hiding","Books are the best of things, well used; abused, among the worst...They are for nothing but to inspire.","That which befits us, embosomed in beauty and wonder as we are, is cheerfulness, and courage, and the endeavor to realize our aspirations. Shall not the heart which has received so much, trust the Power by which it lives? May it not quit other leadings, and listen to the Soul that has guided it so gently, and taught it so much, secure that the future will be worthy of the past?","Imitation cannot go above its model.","A man\'s power to connect his thought with its proper symbol, and so to utter it, depends on the simplicity of his character, that is, upon his love of truth, and his desire to communicate it without loss.","The world is emblematic. Parts of speech are metaphors, because the whole of nature is a metaphor of the human mind.","Its the not the Destination, It\'s the journey.","If we shall take the good we find, asking no questions, we shall have heaping measures.","These times of ours are series and full of calamity, but all times are essentially alike. As soon as there is life there is danger.","All substances the cunning chemist Time\\nMelts down into that liquor of my life.","The wings of Time are black and white,\\nPied with morning and with night.","Let us leave hurry to slaves.","Nature is full of freaks, and now puts an old head on young shoulders, and then takes a young heart heating under fourscore winters.","Today is a king in disguise.","Those who live to the future must always appear selfish to those who live to the present.","Give me insight into today and you may have the antique and future worlds.","Time dissipates to shining ether the solid angularity of facts.","Poverty, Frost, Famine, Rain, Disease, are the beadles and guardsmen that hold us to Common Sense.","Luck is just another word for tenacity of purpose.","Our chief want in life, is,\\nsomeone who shall make us do what we can.\\nThis is the service of a friend.\\nWith him we are easily great.","It is one of the biggest blessing that you can be stupid with your true friends and behave like you shame to do elsewhere","If two or three persons should come with a high spiritual aim and with great powers, the world would fall into their hands like a ripe peach.","We change whether we like it or not.","It is plain that there is no separate essence called courage, no cup or cell in the brain, no vessel in the heart containing drops or atoms that make or give this virtue; but it is the right or healthy state of every man, when he is free to do that which is constitutional to him to do.","Our chief want in life is somebody who will make us do what we can.","This day is all that is good and fair. It is too dear, with its hopes and invitations, to waste a moment on the yesterdays.","Some will always be above others. Destroy the inequality today, and it will appear again tomorrow.","His heart was as great as the world, but there was no room in it to hold the memory of a wrong.","Don\'t be a cynic, and bewail and bemoan. Omit the negative propositions. Don\'t waste yourself in rejection, nor bark against the bad, but chant the beauty of the good. Set down nothing that will help somebody.","Health and appetite impart the sweetness to sugar, bread and meat.","Whatever is old corrupts, and the past turns to snakes.","A feeble man can see the farms that are fenced and tilled, the houses that are built. The strong man sees the possible houses and farms. His eye makes estates as fast as the sun breeds clouds.","We lie in the lap of immense intelligence.","Contemporary American psychiatrist\\nIt is a happy talent to know how to play.","There is no teaching until the pupil is brought into the same state or principle in which you are; a transfusion takes place; he is you, and you are he; then is a teaching; and by no unfriendly chance or bad company can he ever lose the benefit.","Sooner or later that which is now life shall be poetry, and every fair and manly trait shall add a richer strain to the song.","The solid, solid universe\\nIs pervious to Love;\\nWith bandaged eyes he never errs,\\nAround, below, above.\\nHis blinding light\\nHe flingeth white\\nOn God\'s and Satan\'s brood,\\nAnd reconciles\\nBy mystic wiles\\nThe evil and the good.","A ruddy drop of manly blood\\nThe surging sea outweighs;\\nThe world uncertain comes and goes,\\nThe lover rooted stays.","Love, which is the essence of God, is not for levity, but for the total worth of man.","Venus, when her son was lost,\\nCried him up and down the coast,\\nIn hamlets, palaces, and parks,\\nAnd told the truant by his marks,-\\nGolden curls, and quiver, and bow.","it in every fair face, every fair sky,  every fair flower.","Presently we pass to some other object which rounds itself into a whole as did the first; for example, a well-laid garden; and nothing seems worth doing but the laying~out of gardens.","All men are poets at heart. They serve nature for bread, but her loveliness overcomes them sometimes.","The good rain, like a bad preacher, does not know when to leave off.","\\"In the woods we return to reason and faith. There I feel that nothing can befall me in life~~no disgrace, no calamity (leaving me my eyes), which nature cannot repair.\\"","The finest poetry was first experience.","Conservatism stands on man\'s confessed limitations; reform on his indisputable infinitude; conservatism on circumstance; liberalism on power; one goes to make an adroit member of the social frame; the other to postpone all things to the man himself.","Don\'t trust children with edge tools. Don\'t trust man, great God, with more power than he has until he has learned to use that little better. What a hell we should make of the world if we could do what we would!","Wherever there is power there is age.","Explore, and explore. Be neither chided nor flattered out of your position of perpetual inquiry. Neither dogmatize or accept another\'s dogmatism.","Beware when the great God lets loose a thinker on this planet. Then all things are at risk. It is as when a conflagration has broken out in a great city, and no man knows what is safe, or where it will end.","The secrets of life are not shown except to sympathy and likeness.","One man pins me to the wall, while with another I walk among the stars","Fear is an instructor of great sagacity, and the herald of all revolutions.","An eye can threaten like a loaded and levelled gun, or it can insult like hissing or kicking; or, in its altered mood, by beams of kindness, it can make the heart dance for joy.  ...  One of the most wonderful things in nature is a glance of the eye; it transcends speech; it is the bodily symbol of identity.","The whole secret of the teacher\'s force lies in the conviction that men are convertible.","Commerce is of trivial import; love, faith, truth of character, the aspiration of man, these are sacred.","Culture is one thing and varnish is another.","When God lets loose a great thinker on this planet, then all things are at risk. There is not a piece of science but its flank may be turned to-morrow; nor any literary reputation or the so-called eternal names of fame that many not be refused and condemned.","By the rude bridge that arched the flood,\\nTheir flag to April\'s breeze unfurled,\\nHere once the embattled farmers stood,\\nAnd fired the shot heard round the world.\\nThe foe long since in silence slept;\\nAlike the conqueror silent sleeps;\\nAnd Time the ruined bridge has swept\\nDown the dark stream which seaward creeps.\\nOn this green bank, by this soft stream,\\nWe set to-day a votive stone;\\nThat memory may their deed redeem,\\nWhen, like our sires, our sons are gone.","What potent blood hath modest May.","Heaven always bears some proportion to earth. The god of the cannibal will be a cannibal, of the crusades a crusader, and of the merchants a merchant.","If I should go out of church whenever I hear a false sentiment, I could never stay there five minutes.","To this military attitude of the soul we give the name of Heroism... It is a self-trust which slights the restraints of prudence, in the plenitude of its energy and power to repair the harms it may suffer. The hero is a mind of such balance that no disturbances can shake his will.","There is one topic peremptorily forbidden to all well-bred, to all rational mortals, namely, their distempers. If you have not slept or if you have slept or if you have head ache or sciatica or leprosy or thunder-stroke, I beseech you, by all angels, to hold your peace and not pollute the morning.","Strong men greet war, tempest, hard times. They wish, as Pindar said, to tread the floors of hell, with necessities as hard as iron.","Extremes meet, and there is no better example than the naughtiness of humility.","Science is nothing but the finding of analogy, identity, in the most remote parts.","The possibility of interpretation lies in the identity of the observer with the observed. Each material thing has its celestial side; has its translation, through humanity, into the spiritual and necessary sphere, where it plays a part as indestructible as any other.","One of the most wonderful things in nature is a glance of the eye; it transcends speech; it is the bodily symbol of identity.","Every promise of the soul has innumerable fulfillments; each of its joys ripens into a new want.","In the uttermost meaning of the words, thought is devout, and devotion is thought. Deep calls unto deep.","Government has come to be a trade, and is managed solely on commercial principles. A man plunges into politics to make his fortune, and only cares that the world shall last his days.","Nothing is more disgusting than the crowing about liberty by slaves, as most men are, and the flippant mistaking for freedom of some paper preamble like a Declaration of Independence, or the statute right to vote, by those who have never dared to think or to act.","All violence, all that is dreary and repels, is not power, but the absence of power.","Columbus discovered no isle or key so lonely as himself.","The use of literature is to afford us a platform whence we may command a view of our present life, a purchase by which we may move it....we see literature best from the midst of wild nature, or from the din of affairs, or from a high religion. The field cannot be well seen from within the field.","The passive master lent his hand, To the vast Soul which o\'er him planned.","What is a man born for but to be a reformer, a remaker of what has been made, a denouncer of lies, a restorer of truth and good?","The glory of the farmer is that, in the division of labors, it is his part to create. All trade rests at last on his primitive activity. He stands close to Nature; he obtains from the earth the bread and the meat. The food which was not, he causes to be.","It has been the office of art to educate the perception of beauty. We are immersed in beauty but our eyes have no clear vision.","Let us answer a book of ink with a book of flesh and blood.","So far as a person thinks; they are free.","I would have the studies elective.  Scholarship is to be created not by compulsion, but by awakening a pure interest in knowledge. The wise instructor accomplishes this by opening to his pupils precisely the attractions the study has for himself.  The marking is a system for schools, not for the college; for boys, not for men; and it is an ungracious work to put on a professor.","I know and see too well, when not voluntarily blind, the speedy limits opersons called high and worthy.","A mob is a society obodies, voluntarily bereaving themselves oreason, and traversing its work. The mob is man, voluntarily descending to the nature othe beast. Its fit hour oactivity is night; its actions are insane, like its whole constitution.","I find nothing in fables more astonishing than my experience in every hour. One moment of a man\'s life is a fact so stupendous as to take the luster out of fiction.","The dearest events are summer-rain.","Life is a series of surprises.","Life is a boundless privilege, and when you pay for your ticket, and get into the car, you have no guess what good company you shall find there.","There is this to be said in favor of drinking, that it takes the drunkard first out of society, then out of the world.","All poets have signalized their consciousness of rare moments when they were superior to themselves, -when a light, a freedom, a power came to them which lifted them to performances far better than they could reach at other times.","The secret of drunkenness is, that it insulates us in thought, whilst it unites us in feeling.","Outside among your fellows, among strangers, you must preserve appearances, a hundred things you cannot do; but inside, the terrible freedom.","Greatness once and forever has down with opinion.","Heroism feels and never reasons, and therefore is always right.","Men imagine that they communicate their virtue or vice only by overt actions, and do not see that virtue or vice emit a breath every moment.","I see not any road of perfect peace which a man can walk but after the counsel of his own bosom.","I see it only that thyself is here, and art and nature, hope and fate, friends, angels and the supreme being shall not be absent from the chamber where thou sittest.","O friend, never strike sail to a fear!","If you would serve your brother it is fit for you to serve him, do not take back your words when you find that prudent people do not commend you. Be true to your own act, and congratulate yourself if you have done something strange and extravagant and broken the monotony of a decorous age.","The unbelief of the age is attested by the loud condemnation of trifles.","Philanthropic and religious bodies do not commonly make their executive officers out of saints.","Picture and sculpture are the celebrations and festivities of form.","Culture opens the sense of beauty.","Let him go where he will, he can only find so much beauty or worth as he carries.","A beautiful woman is a picture which drives all beholders nobly mad.","A beautiful behavior is better than a beautiful form; it gives a higher pleasure than statues or pictures; it is the finest of fine arts.","Any extraordinary degree of beauty in man or woman involves a moral charm.","We are too civil to books. For a few golden sentences we will turn over and actually read a volume of four or five hundred pages.","We prize books, and they prize them most who are themselves wise.","Neither is a dictionary a bad book to read. There is no can\'t in it, no excess of explanation, and it is full of suggestion, the raw material of possible poems and histories.","Far off, men swell, bully, and threaten; bring them hand to hand, and they are feeble folk.","For a great nature, it is a happiness to escape a religious training; religion of character is so apt to be invaded.","The wise man, the true friend, the finished character, we seek everywhere, and only find in fragments.","Repose and cheerfulness is the badge of the gentleman; repose in energy.","I have heard with admiring submission the experience of the lady who declared that the sense of being well dressed gives a feeling of inward tranquility which religion is powerless to bestow.","Criticism should not be querulous and wasting, all knife and root-puller, but guiding, instructive, inspiring, a south wind, not an east wind.","Debt, grinding debt, whose iron face the widow, the orphan, and the sons of genius fear and hate; debt, which consumes so much time, which so cripples and disheartens a great spirit with cares that seem so base, is a preceptor whose lessons cannot be foregone, and is needed most by those who suffer from it most.","The office of the scholar is to cheer, to raise, and to guide men by showing them facts amidst appearances.","To believe in luck, if it were not a solecism so to use the word believe, is skepticism.","Experience is the only teacher, and we get his lesson indifferently in any school.","The finished man of the world must eat of every apple once.","The mark of a man of the world is absence of pretension.","All persons are puzzles until at last we find in some word or act the key to the man, to the woman; straightway all their past words and actions lie in light before us.","Moral qualities rule the world, but at short distances the senses are despotic.","The imagination and the senses cannot be gratified at the same time.","A part of fate is the freedom of man. Forever wells up the impulse of choosing and acting in his soul.","To fill the hour; that is happiness to fill the hour, and leave no crevice for a repentance or an approval.","There is a genius of a nation, which is not to be found in the numerical citizens, but which characterizes the society.","Many a profound genius, I suppose, who fills the world with fame of his exploding renowned errors, is yet everyday posed and baffled by trivial questions at his own supper table.","If men would avoid that general language and general manner in which they strive to hide all that is peculiar, and would say only what was uppermost in their own minds, after their own individual manner, every man would be interesting.","A man is not to aim at innocence, any more than he is to aim at hair, but he is to keep it.","The Englishman who has lost his fortune is said to have died of a broken heart.","A scholar is a man with his inconvenience, that, when you ask him his opinion of any matter, he must go home and look up his manuscripts to know.","Every reform was once a private opinion, and when it shall be a private opinion again, it will solve the problem of the age.","Nature is no spendthrift, but takes the shortest way to her ends.","We can see well into the past; we can guess shrewdly into the future, but that which is rolled up and muffled in impenetrable folds is today.","Is there a difference?  Yes. We are in harmony with nature, but never at peace.","The wise man always throws himself on the side of his assailants. It is more his interest than it is theirs to find his weak point.","It is not the irregular hours or irregular diet that makes the romantic life.","Every ship is a romantic object, except that we sail in.","The sanity of society is a balance of a thousand insanity\'s.","Every man is an infinitely repelling orb, and holds his individual being on that condition.","The most active lives have so much routine as to preclude progress almost equally with the most inactive.","An original sentence, a step forward, is worth more than all the censures.","Power educates the potentate.","There are men who, by their sympathetic attractions, carry nations with them, and lead the activity of the human race.","The spirit of our American radicalism is destructive and aimless; it is not loving; it has no ulterior and divine ends; but is destructive only out of hatred and selfishness.","The philosophy of waiting is sustained by all the oracles of the universe.","The hearing ear is always found close to the speaking tongue.","Among provocative, the next best thing to good preaching is bad preaching.","Wit makes its own welcome, and levels all distinctions. No dignity, no learning, no force of character, can make any stand against good wit.","Women see better than men. Men see lazily, if they do not expect to act. Women see quite without any wish to act.","He, who loves the bristle of bayonets, only sees in their glitter what beforehand he feels in his hand.","Wise men are not wise at all times.","Crime and punishment grow out of one stem.","There is a capacity of virtue in us, and there is a capacity of vice to make your blood creep.","The moral sense reappears today with the same morning newness that has been from of old the fountain of beauty and strength. You say there is no religion now. \'Tis like saying in rainy weather, There is no sun, when at that moment we are witnessing one of its superlative effects.","Thought makes everything fit for use.","Thought is the property of him who can entertain it, and of him who can adequately place it.","Begin and proceed on a settled conviction that but little is permitted to any man to do or to know, and if he complies with the first grand laws, he shall do well.","Science was false by being unpoetical. It assumed to explain a reptile or a mollusk, and isolated it-which is hunting for life in graveyards. Reptile or mollusk or man or angel only exists in system, in relation.","The angels are so enamored of the language that is spoken in heaven that they will not distort their lips with the hissing and unmusical dialects of men, but speak their own, whether their be any who understand it or not.","The eye is easily frightened.","In the presence of nature, a wild delight runs through the man, in spite of real sorrows.","The the illuminated mind the whole world sparkles with light.","When a man says to me, \\"I have the intensest love of nature,\\" at once I know that he has none.","We are as much informed of a writer\'s genius by what he selects as by what he originates.","The great object of Education should be commensurate with the object of life. It should be a moral one; to teach self-trust: to inspire the youthful man with an interest in himself; with a curiosity touching his own nature; to acquaint him with the resources of his mind, and to teach him that there is all his strength.","You cannot do a kindness too soon.","Give no bounties: make equal laws: secure life and prosperity and you need not give alms.","The soul refuses limits and always affirms an optimism, never a pessimism.","Imagination is not a talent of some men but is the health of every man.","A few strong instincts and a few plain rules suffice us","He decided to give up his large ambition of knowledge and action for any narrow craft or profession, aiming at a much more comprehensive calling, the art of living.","Power is what they want, not candy-power to execute their design, power to give legs and feet, form and actuality to their thought; which, to a clear-sighted man, appears the end for which the universe exists, and all its resources might be well applied.","In like manner the effect of every action is measured by the depth of the sentiment from which it proceeds. The great man knew not that he was great. It took a century or two for that fact to appear. What he did, he did, he did because he must; it was the most natural thing in the world, and grew out of the circumstances of the moment.","Genius appeals to the future.","Men of sense esteem wealth to be the assimilation of nature to themselves, the converting of the sap and juices of the planet to the incarnation and nutriment of their design.","We can only be valued as we make ourselves valuable.","\'Tis a short sight to limit our faith in laws to those of gravity, of chemistry, of botany, and so forth. Those laws do not stop where our eyes lose them, but push the same geometry and chemistry up into the invisible plane of social and rational life, so that, look where we will, in a boy\'s game, or in the strifes of races, a perfect reaction, a perpetual judgment keeps watch and ward.","The lessons of science should be experimental also. The sight of a planet through a telescope is worth all the course on astronomy; the shock of the electric spark in the elbow outvalues all theories; the taste of the nitrous oxide, the firing of an artificial volcano, are better than volumes of chemistry.","Nature may be as selfishly studied as trade. Astronomy to the selfish becomes astrology; psychology, mesmerism (with intent to show where aour spoons are gone); and anatomy and physiology become phrenology and palmistry.","Astronomy is a cold, desert science, with all its pompous figures,-depends a little too much on the glass-grinder, too little on the mind. \'T is of no use to show us more planets and systems. We know already what matter is, and more or less of it does not signify.","The first steps in Agriculture, Astronomy, Zoology, (those first steps which the farmer, the hunter, and the sailor take,) teach that nature\'s dice are always loaded; that in her heaps and rubbish are concealed sure and useful results.","The sciences, even the best,-mathematics and astronomy,-are like sportsmen, who seize whatever prey offers, even without being able to make any use of it.","In science we have to consider two things: power and circumstance.","Intellect is void of affection and sees an object as it stands in the light of science, cool and disengaged. The intellect goes out of the individual, floats over its own personality, and regards it as a fact, and not as I and mine.","Science always goes abreast with the just elevation of the man, keeping step with religion and metaphysics; or, the state of science is an index of our self-knowledge.","Science corrects the old creeds, sweeps away, with every new perception, our infantile catechisms, and necessitates a faith commensurate with the grander orbits and universal laws which it discloses yet it does not surprise the moral sentiment that was older and awaited expectant these larger insights.","Science finds it methods.","Science surpasses the old miracles of mythology.","Science, Nature,-O, I\'ve yearned to open some page.","Something is wanting to science until it has been humanised.","The Good Spirit never cared for the colleges, and though all men and boys were now drilled in Greek, Latin, and Mathematics, it had quite left these shells high on the beach, and was creating and feeding other matters [science] at other ends of the world.","As Arkwright and Whitney were the demi-gods of cotton, so prolific Time will yet bring an inventor to every plant. There is not a property in nature but a mind is born to seek and find it.","The idiot, the Indian, the child and unschooled farmer\'s boy stand nearer to the light by which nature is to be read, than the dissector or the antiquary.","Our best history is still poetry.","It is always so pleasant to be generous, though very vexatious to pay debts.","We cannot let our angels go; we do not see that they only go out that archangels may come in.","We must be courteous to a man as we are to a picture, which we are willing to give the advantage of a good light.","The first and last lesson of religion is, \\"The things that are seen, are temporal; the things that are unseen, are eternal.\\" It puts an affront upon nature.","A woman should always challenge our respect, and never move our compassion.","The book written against fame and learning has the author\'s name on the title-page.","Give all to love: Obey thy heart; Friends, kindred, days, Estate, good fame, Plans, credit, and the Muse,- Nothing refuse.","Most people, who have quit smoking, have had at least one unsuccessful try in the past. It is not important how many times you try to quit. The only important thing is, that eventually you stay quit","Practice makes perfect - the sooner you start, the sooner you will be a happy nonsmoker","In these divine pleasures permitted to me of walks in the June night under moon and stars, I can put my life as a fact before me and stand aloof from its honor and shame.","Life is not measured by its length, but by its depth.","Fate, then, is a name for facts not yet passed under the fire of thought; for causes which are unpenetrated.","If we must accept fate we are not less compelled to affirm liberty, the significance of the individual, the grandeur of duty, the power of character.","A little consideration of what takes place around us every day would show us that a higher law than that of our will regulates events; that our painful labors are unnecessary and fruitless; that only in our easy, simple, spontaneous action are we strong . . . . Place yourself in the middle of the stream of power and wisdom which animates all whom it floats, and you are without effort impelled to truth, to right, and a perfect contentment.","As there is a use in medicine for poisons, so the world cannot move without rogues.","Build, therefore, your own world. As fast as you conform your life to the pure idea in your mind, that will unfold it\'s great proportions.","Men over forty are no judges of a book written in a new spirit.","You have first an instinct, then an opinion, then a knowledge, as the plant has root, bud, and fruit.","We shun the rugged battle of fate where strength is born.","Solitude, the safeguard of mediocrity, is to genius the stern friend","Character is an invincible force, which acts by presence and without means","He that rides his hobby gently must always give way to him that rides his hobby hard.","To have played and laughed with enthusiasm, and sung with exultation - this to to have succeeded.","Put the argument into a concrete shape, into an image, some hard phrase, round and solid as a ball, which they can see and handle and carry home with them, and the cause is half won.","A man passes for that he is worth.  What he is engraves itself on his face, on his form, on his fortunes, in letters of light.  Concealment avails him nothing; boasting nothing.  There is confession in the glances of our eyes; in our smiles; in salutations; and the grasp of hands.","Public opinion, I am sorry to say, will bear a great deal of nonsense. There is scarcely any absurdity so gross, whether in religion, politics, science or manners, which it will not bear.","Let us be poised, wise and our own today.","We say love is blind, and the figure of Cupid is drawn with a bandage around his eyes. Blind - yes, because he does not see what he does not like; but the sharpest-sighted hunter in the universe is Love for finding what he seeks, and only that.","The laws of light and of heat translate each other;-so do the laws of sound and colour; and so galvanism, electricity and magnetism are varied forms of this selfsame energy.","Coal is a portable climate.","The most Indian thing about the Indian is surely not his moccasins or his calumet, his wampum or his stone hatched, but traits of character and sagacity, skill, or passion.","He who loves the bristle of bayonets only sees in the glitter what beforehand he feels in his heart.  It is avarice and hatred; it is that quivering lip, that cold, hating eye, which built magazines and powder-houses.","Necessity does everything well.","Civilization depends on morality.","All great successes are the triumph of persistence.","The soul is not born; it does not die; it was not produced from anyone\x85 Unborn, eternal, it is not slain, though the body is slain.","A man makes inferiors his superiors by heat; self-control is the rule.","Among provocatives, the next best thing to good preaching is bad preaching. I have even more thoughts during or enduring it than at other times.","The world looks like a multiplication-table, or a mathematical equation, which, turn it how you will, balances itself.","The field cannot be seen from within the field.","Nothing is quite beautiful alone; nothing but is beautiful in the whole. A single object is only so far beautiful as it suggests this universal grace.","Go put your creed into your deed, Nor speak with double tongue.","I find that the Americans have no passions, they have appetites.","Nations have lost their old omnipotence; the patriotic tiedoes not hold. Nations are getting obsolete, we go and live where we will.","The difference between Talent and Genius is that Talent says things which he has never heard but once, and Genius things which he has never heard.","The moment we indulge our affections, the earth is metamorphosed.","The only thing grief has taught me is to know how shallow it is.","All great natures delight in stability; all great men find eternity affirmed in the very promise of their faculties.","There are two classes of poets - the poets by education and practice, these we respect; and poets by nature, these we love.","No one suspects the days to be gods.","He who loves goodness harbors angels, reveres reverence, and lives with God.","Preaching is the expression of moral sentiments applied to the duties of life.","Life too near paralyses art.","Self-reliance is its aversion. It loves not realities and creators, but names and customs.","The worst of charity is that the lives you are asked to preserve are not worth preserving.","The wise through excess of wisdom is made a fool.","Pines a thousand years old. Every year they must go farther for them: they recede, like beavers and Indians, before the white man.","If a man knows the law, find out, though he live in a pine shanty, and resort to him. And if a man can pipe or sing, so as to wrap the imprisoned soul in an elysium; or can paint a landscape, and convey into souls and ochres all the enchantments of Spring or Autumn; or can liberate and intoxicate all people who hear him with delicious songs and verses; it is certain that the secret cannot be kept; the first witness tells it to a second, and men go by fives and tens and fifties to his doors.","Cities force growth and make people talkative and entertaining, but they also make them artificial.","People suffer all their life long, under the foolish superstition that they can be cheated. But it is impossible for a person to be cheated by anyone but himself.","In conversation the game is, to say something new with old words. And you shall observe a man of the people picking his way along, step by step, using every time an old boulder, yet never setting his foot on an old place.","What is life but the angle of vision? A man is measured by the angle at which he looks at objects.","We never touch but at points.","The wise know that foolish legislation is a rope of sand, which perishes in the twisting.","Is the parent better than the child into whom he has cast his ripened being? Whence, then, this worship of the past?","The profoundest thought or passion sleeps as in a mine, until an equal mind and heart finds and publishes it.","Out from the heart of Nature rolled The burdens of the Bible old.","Life only avails, not the having lived.","Our people are slow to learn the wisdom of sending character instead of talent to Congress. Again and again they have sent a man of great acuteness, a fine scholar, a fine forensic orator, and some master of the brawls has crunched him up in his hands like a bit of paper.","The religion that is afraid of science dishonors God and commits suicide. Every influx of atheism, of skepticism, is thus made useful as a mercury pill assaulting and removing a diseased religion, and making way for truth.","Society is infested by persons who, seeing that the sentiments please, counterfeit the expression of them. These we call sentimentalists - talkers who mistake the description for the thing, saying for having.","Washington, where an insignificant individual may trespass on a nation\'s time.","If speculation tends thus to a terrific unity, in which all things are absorbed, action tends directly back to diversity. The first is the course or gravitation of mind; the second is the power of nature. Nature is manifold. The unity absorbs, and melts or reduces. Nature opens and creates. These two principles reappear and interpenetrate all things, all thought; the one, the many.","Democracy is morose, and runs to anarchy.","Most of the great results of history are brought about by discreditable means.","It is long ere we discover how rich we are. Our history, we are sure, is quite tame: we have nothing to write, nothing to infer. But our wiser years still run back to the despised recollections of childhood. . . .","Every man is eloquent once in his life.","The influence of fine scenery, the presence of mountains, appeases our irritations and elevates our friendships.","There is no prosperity, trade, art, city, or great material wealth of any kind, but if you trace it home, you will find it rooted in a thought of some individual man.","The House\\n\\n...She lays her beams in music,\\nIn music everyone,\\nTo the cadence of the whirling world\\nWhich dances around the sun-\\nThat so they shall not be displaced\\nBy lapses or by wars,\\nBut for the love of happy souls\\nOutlive the newest stars.","A home kept to the end of display is impossible to all but a few women, and their success is dearly bought.","The masses have no habit of self-reliance or original action.","It the proof of high culture to say the greatest matters in the simplest way.","The whole course of things goes to teach us faith. We need only obey. There is guidance for each of us, and by lowly listening we shall hear the right word. . . . Place yourself in the middle of the stream of power and wisdom which flows into you as life, place yourself in the full center of that flood, then you are without effort impelled to truth, to right, and a perfect contentment.","Wouldst thou shut up the avenues of ill, Pay every debt as if God wrote the bill.","If you are wise, you will dread a prosperity which only loads you with more.","Immitation is suicide.","Let us not forget the genial miraculous force we have known to proceed from a book.","We expect a great man to be a good reader.","We walk alone in the world.","The experience of each new age requires a new confession, and the world seems always waiting for its poet","Yet these uneasy pleasures and fine pains are for curiosity, and not for life.","All the great ages have been ages of belief.","Every opinion reacts on him who utters it.","The best bribe which London offers to-day to the imagination, is, that, in such a vast variety of people and conditions, one can believe there is room for persons of romantic character to exist, and that the poet, the mystic, and the hero may hope to confront their counterparts.","Pay no heed to the average photographer\'s remarks upon \\"flat\\" and \\"weak\\" negatives. Probably he is flat, weak, stale, and unprofitable; your negative may be first-rate, and probably is if he does not approve of it.","Artists must be sacrificed to their art.","The constructive intellect [genius] produces thoughts, sentences, poems, plans, designs, systems. It is the generation of the mind, the marriage of thought with nature.","Daughter of heaven and earth, coy Spring,\\nWith sudden passion languishing,\\nTeaching barren moors to smile,\\nPainting pictures mile on mile,\\nHolds a cup of cowslip wreaths\\nWhence a smokeless incense breathes.","Perhaps love is only the highest symbol of friendship, as all other things seem symbols of love.","The effect of the indulgence of human affection is a certain cordial exhilaration.","Action is the process whereby what is not fully formed passes into expressive consciousness.","The last change in our point of view gives the whole world a pictorial air.","Power ceases in the instant of repose; it resides in the moment of transition from a past to a new state, in the shooting of the gulf, in the darting to an aim.","Only to youth will spring be spring.","God may forgive sins, he said, but awkwardness has no forgiveness in heaven or earth.","Literature is the effort of man to indemnify himself for the wrongs of his condition.","Throughout the ages there have always been those who have been willing to go beyond the norms and reach for that unknown and distant star.","Hast thou named all the birds without a gun?","In talking with scholars, I observe that they lost on ruder companions those years of boyhood which alone could give imaginative literature a religious and infinite quality in their esteem.","Society, to be sure, does not like this very well; it saith, Whoso goes to walk alone, accuses the whole world; he declares all to be unfit to be his companions; it is very uncivil, nay, insulting; Society will retaliate.","I am grown by sympathy a little eager and sentimental, but leave me alone, and I should relish every hour and what it brought me, the pot-luck of the day, as heartily as the oldest gossip in the bar-room.","To the men of this world, to the animal strength and spirits, to the men of practical power, whilst immersed in it, the man of ideas appears out of his reason. They alone gave reason.","Go where he will, the wise man is at home, His hearth the earth, his hall the azure dome.","Society everywhere is in conspiracy against the manhood of every one of its members.","It is easy to see that a greater self-reliance must work a revolution in all the offices and relations of men; in their religion; in their education; in their pursuits; their modes of living; their association; in their property; in their speculative views.","A man should learn to detect and watch that gleam of light which flashes across his mind from within, more than the luster of the firmament of bards and sages","We but half express ourselves, and are ashamed of that divine idea which each of us represents.","He cumbers himself never about consequences, about interests; he gives an independent, genuine verdict. You must court him: he does not court you. But the man is, as it were, clapped into jail by his consciousness.","Virtues are, in the popular estimate, rather the exception than the rule. There is the man and his virtues.","The objection to conforming to usages that have become dead to you is, that it scatters your force.","But do your work, and I shall know you. Do your work, and you shall reinforce yourself.","We love it because it is self dependent, self derived, and therefore of an old immaculate pedigree, even if shown in a young person.","I do not wish to please him; I wish that he should wish to please me.","The relations of the soul to the divine spirit are so pure, that it is profane to seek to interpose helps.","If we live truly, we shall see truly. It is as easy for the strong man to be strong, as it is for the weak to be weak.","I must be myself. I cannot break myself any longer for you, or you. If you can love me for what I am, we shall be the happier. If you cannot, I will still seek to seserve that you should.","But man postpones or remembers; he does not live in the present, but with reverted eye laments the past, or, heedless of the riches that surround him, stands on tiptoe to foresee the future. He cannot be happy and strong until he too lives with nature in the present, above time.","Every natural fact is a symbol of some spiritual fact. Every appearance in nature corresponds to some state of the mind, and that state of the mind can only be described by presenting that natural appearance as its picture.","The forest is my loyal friend\\nA Delphic shrine to me.","Science does not know its debt to imagination. Goethe did not believe that a great naturalist could exist without this faculty.","That which we do not believe, we cannot adequately say; even though we may repeat the words ever so often.","Go face the fire at sea, or the cholera in your friend\'s house, or the burglar in your own, or what danger lies in the way of duty, knowing you are guarded by the cherubim of Destiny. If you believe in Fate to your harm, believe it, at least, for your good.","I wiped away the weeds and foam, I fetched my sea-born treasures home; But the poor, unsightly, noisome things Had left their beauty on the shore, With the sun and the sand and the wild uproar.","Rhodora! If the sages ask thee why This charm is wasted on the earth and sky, Tell them, dear, that if eyes were made for seeing, Then Beauty is its own excuse for being.","Men are conservatives when they are least vigorous, or when they are most luxurious. They are conservatives after dinner, or before taking their rest; when they are sick or aged. In the morning, or when their intellect or their conscience has been aroused, when they hear music, or when they read poetry, they are radicals.","The compensations of calamity are made apparent to the understanding also, after long intervals of time.","The truth, the hope of any time, must always be sought in minorities.","\'Well,\' said Red Jacket [to someone complaining that he had not enough time], \'I suppose you have all there is.\'","The unstable estimates of men crowd to him whose mind is filled with a truth, as the heaped waves of the Atlantic follow the moon.","The day is always his, who works in it with serenity and great aims.","When you have worn out your shoes, the strength of the show fiber has passed into your body.","And what fastens attention, in the intercourse of life, like any passage betraying affection between two parties? Perhaps we never saw them before, and never shall meet them again. But we see them exchange a glance, or betray a deep emotion, and we are no longer strangers. We understand them, and take the warmest interest in the development of the romance. All mankind love a lover.","Undoubtedly we have no questions to ask which are unanswerable. We must trust the perfection of the creation so far, as to believe that whatever curiosity the order of things has awakened in our minds, the order of things can satisfy. Every man\'s condition is a solution in hieroglyphic to those inquiries he would put. He acts it as life, before he apprehends it as truth.","What strength belongs to every plant and animal in nature. The tree or the brook has no duplicity, no pretentiousness, no show. It is, with all its might and main, what it is, and makes one and the same impression and effect at all times. All the thoughts of a turtle are turtle\'s, and of a rabbit, rabbit\'s. But a man is broken and dissipated by the giddiness of his will; he does not throw himself into his judgments; his genius leads him one way but \'t is likely his trade or politics in quite another.","Broader and deeper we must write our annals, from an ethical reformation, from an influx of the ever new, ever sanative conscience, if we would trulier express our central and wide-related nature, instead of this old chronology of selfishness and pride to which we have too long lent our eyes. Already that day exists for us, shines in on us at unawares, but the path of science and of letters is not the way into nature. The idiot, the Indian, the child, and unschooled farmer\'s boy, stand nearer to the light by which nature is to be read, than the dissector or the antiquary.","A mind does not receive truth as a chest receives jewels that are put into it, but as the stomach takes up food into the system. It is no longer food, but flesh, and is assimilated. The appetite and the power of digestion measure our right to knowledge. He has it who can use it. As soon as our accumulation overruns our invention or power to use, the evils of intellectual gluttony begin,\u2014 congestion of the brain, apoplexy and strangulation.","The state of society is one in which the members have suffered amputation from the trunk, and strut about so many walking monsters,\u2014a good finger, a neck, a stomach, an elbow, but never a man.","It is the fault of our rhetoric that we cannot strongly state one fact without seeming to belie some other.","The stars awaken a certain reverence, because though always present, they are inaccessible; but all natural objects make a kindred impression, when the mind is open to their influence. Nature never wears a mean appearance. Neither does the wisest man extort her secret, and lose his curiosity by finding out all her perfection. Nature never became a toy to a wise spirit. The flowers, the animals, the mountains, reflected the wisdom of his best hour, as much as they had delighted the simplicity of his childhood.","Goodness that preaches undoes itself.","The human body is a magazine of inventions, the patent office, where are the models from which every hint is taken. All the tools and engines on earth are only extensions of its limbs and senses.","It is wonderful how soon a piano gets into a log-hut on the frontier. You would think they found it under a pine-stump. With it comes a Latin grammar, and one of those tow-head boys has written a hymn on Sunday. Now let colleges, now let senates take heed! for here is one who, opening these fine tastes on the basis of the pioneer\'s iron constitution, will gather all their laurels in his strong hands.","A character is like an acrostic or Alexandrian stanza; - read it forward, backward, or across, it still spells the same thing.","I would put myself in the attitude to look in the eye an abstract truth, and I cannot. I blench and withdraw on this side and on that. I seem to know what he meant who said, No man can see God face to face and live.","Tragedy is in the eye of the observer, and not in the heart of the sufferer.","There are people who have an appetite for grief; pleasure is not strong enough and they crave pain. They have mithridatic stomachs which must be fed on poisoned bread, natures so doomed that no prosperity can sooth their ragged and dishevelled desolation.","I honor health as the first muse, and sleep as the condition of health. Sleep benefits mainly by the sound health it produces; incidentally also by dreams, into whose farrago a divine lesson is sometimes slipped.","There is no one who does not exaggerate. In conversation, men are encumbered with personality, and talk too much.","Tis a rule of manners to avoid exaggeration.","Exaggeration is in the course of things. Nature sends no creature, no man into the world, without adding a small excess of his proper quality. Given the planet, it is still necessary to add the impulse; so, to every creature nature added a little violence of direction in its proper path, a shove to put it on its way; in every instance, a slight generosity, a drop too much.","Health is the first muse, comprising the magical benefits of air, landscape, and bodily exercise on the mind.","Tis curious that we only believe as deeply as we live.","[A]s if life were a thunder-storm wherein you can see by a flash the horizon, and then cannot see your hand.","With most men, scarce a link of memory holds yesterday and to-day together.","Ah Fate, cannot a man Be wise without a beard? East, West, from Beer to Dan, Say, was it never heard That wisdom might in youth be gotten, Or wit be ripe before \'t was rotten?","Solitary converse with nature; for thence are ejaculated sweet and dreadful words never uttered in libraries. Ah! the spring days, the summer dawns, and October woods!","Nature is sanative, refining, elevating. How cunningly she hides every wrinkle of her inconceivable antiquity under roses, and violets, and morning dew! Every inch of the mountains is scarred by unimaginable convulsions, yet the new day is purple with the bloom of youth and love.","Is all literature eavesdropping, and all art Chinese imitation? our life a custom, and our body borrowed, like a beggar\u2019s dinner, from a hundred charities?","Immortality. I notice that as soon as writers broach this question they begin to quote. I hate quotation. Tell me what you know.","Of all debts, men are least willing to pay their taxes; what a satire this is on government.","A just thinker will allow full swing to his scepticism. I dip my pen in the blackest ink, because I am not afraid of falling into my inkpot.... We are of different opinions at different hours, but we always may be said to be at heart on the side of truth.","When a man meets his make, society begins.","Thanks to the morning light, Thanks to the foaming sea, To the uplands of New Hampshire, To the green-haired forest free.","The attraction and superiority of California are in its days. It has better days & more of them, than any other country.","The mystic must be steadily told,-All that you say is just as true without the tedious use of that symbol as with it. Let us have a little algebra, instead of this trite rhetoric,-universal signs, instead of these village symbols,-and we shall both be gainers. The history of hierarchies seems to show that all religious error consisted in making the symbol too stark and solid, and was at last nothing but an excess of the organ of language.","People are timid and apologetic; they are no longer upright; they dare not say \\"I think,\\" \\"I am,\\" but quote some saint or sage.  They are ashamed before the blade of grass or the blowing rose.  These roses under my window make no reference to former roses or to better ones; they are for what they are; they exist with God to-day.","There is no luck in literary reputation. They who make up the final verdict upon every book are not the partial and noisy readers of the hour when it appears; but a court as of angels, a public not to be bribed, not to be entreated, and not to be overawed, decides upon every man\'s title to fame.","That which we call character is a reserved force which acts directly by presence, and without means. It is conceived of as a certain undemonstrable force, a familiar or genius, by whose impulses the man is guided, but whose counsels he cannot impart.","That which builds is better than that which is built.","The compensations of calamity are made apparent to the understanding also, after long intervals of time. A fever, a mutilation, a cruel disappointment, a loss of wealth, a loss of friends, seems at the moment unpaid loss, and unpayable. But the sure years reveal the deep remedial force that underlies all facts.","If a man knew anything, he would sit in a corner and be modest; but he is such an ignorant peacock, that he goes bustling up and down, and hits on extraordinary discoveries.","Tobacco and opium have broad backs, and will cheerfully carry the load of armies, if you choose to make them pay high for such joy as they give and such harm as they do.","An empire is an immense egotism.","There is no one who does not exaggerate!","I can reason down or deny everything, except this perpetual Belly: feed he must and will, and I cannot make him respectable.","The chief mourner does not always attend the funeral.","The torments of martyrdom are probably most keenly felt by the bystanders.","We boast our emancipation from many superstitions; but if we have broken any idols, it is through a transfer of idolatry.","Other men are lenses through which we read our own minds. Each man seeks those of different quality from his own, and such as are good of their kind; that is, he seeks other men, and the rest.","It is hard to go beyond your public. If they are satisfied with cheap performance, you will not easily arrive at better. If they know what is good, and require it. you will aspire and burn until you achieve it. But from time to time, in history, men are born a whole age too soon.","The walking of Man is falling forwards.","It depends little on the object, much on the mood, in art.","The Yankee is one who, if he once gets his teeth set on a thing, all creation can\'t make him let go.","The aid we can give each other is only incidental, lateral, and sympathetic.","The eye is the painter and the ear the singer.","The affections cannot keep their youth any more than men.","It is a tie between men to have read the same book.","I should as soon think of swimming across Charles River, when I wish to go to Boston, as of reading all my books in originals, when I have them rendered for me in my mother tongue.","Wait, and thy soul shall speak.","If we meet no gods, it is because we harbor none. If there is grandeur in you, you will find grandeur in porters and sweeps.","The spirit of the world, the great calm presence of the creator, comes not forth to the sorceries of opium or of wine.","It is in bad taste,\\" is the most formidable word an Englishman can pronounce.","Everything is prospective, and man is to live hereafter. That the world is for his education is the only sane solution of the enigma.","Meek young men grow up in colleges and believe it is their duty to accept the views which books have given, and grow up slaves.","As long as any man exists, there is some need of him.","The \\"times,\\" \\"the age\\" what is that, but a few profound persons and a few active persons who epitomize the times?","We go to Europe to be Americanized.","The soul contains the event that shall befall it, for the event is only the actualization of its thoughts; and what we pray to ourselves for is always granted.","A believer, a mind whose faith is consciousness, is never disturbed because other persons do not yet see the fact which he sees.","I can find my biography in every fable that I read.","Don\'t make a novel to establish a principle of political economy. You will spoil both.","The love of novels is the preference of sentiment to the senses.","Though we love goodness and not stealing, yet also we love freedom and not preaching.","Wild liberty breeds iron conscience; natures with great impulses have great resources, and return from far.","God evidently does not intend us all to be rich, or powerful or great, but He does intend us all to be friends.","The only money of God is God. He pays never with any thing less, or any thing else.","Be a football to Time and Chance, the more kicks, the better, so that you inspect the whole game and know its utmost law.","Commonsense is the wick of the candle.","Every man is entitled to be valued by his best moment.","If you would know what nobody knows, read what everybody reads, just one year afterwards.","A human being should beware how he laughs, for then he shows all his faults.","Life itself is ... a sleep within a sleep.","People who know how to act are never preachers.","The instinct of the people is right.","The poor are only they who feel poor.","All power is of one kind, a sharing of the nature of the world. The mind that is parallel with the laws of nature will be in the current of events, and strong with their strength.","Life is a search after power; and this is an element with which the world is so saturated,-there is no chink or crevice in which it is not lodged,-that no honest seeking goes unrewarded.","I like a man who likes to see a fine barn as well as a good tragedy.","Prayer as a means to effect a private end is theft and meanness.","It is the eye which makes the horizon.","Go into one of our cool churches, and begin to count the words that might be spared, and in most places the entire sermon will go.","The sermon which I write inquisitive of truth is good a year after, but that which is written because a sermon must be writ is musty the next day.","If the East loves infinity, the West delights in boundaries.","Fear God, and where you go men shall think they walk in hallowed cathedrals.","We do what we can, and then make a theory to prove our performance the best.","The doctrine of Necessity or Destiny is the doctrine of Toleration.","Play out the game, act well your part, and if the gods have blundered, we will not.","Take egotism out and you would castrate the benefactors.","The shoemaker makes a good shoe because he makes nothing else.","Souls are not saved in bundles.","Our health is our sound relation to external objects; our sympathy with external being.","Every man is grave alone.","The State is our neighbors; our neighbors are the State.","The State is a poor, good beast who means the best: it means friendly.","When fear enters the heart of a man at hearing the names of candidates and the reading of laws that are proposed, then is the State safe, but when these things are heard without regard, as above or below us, then is the Commonwealth sick or dead.","A great man will find a great subject, or which is the same thing, make any subject great.","How we hate this solemn Ego that accompanies the learned, like a double, wherever he goes.","There is not a piece of science, but its flank may be turned tomorrow.","Tis a short sight to limit our faith in laws to those of gravity, of chemistry, of botany, and so forth.","Don\'t set out to teach theism from your natural history... You spoil both.","The eye obeys exactly the action of the mind.","A sleeping child gives me the impression of a traveler in a very far country.","Pain, indolence, sterility, endless ennui have also their lesson for you, if you are great.","The question is whether [suicide] is the way out, or the way in.","Any work looks wonderful to me except the one which I can do.","God will have life to be real; we will be damned, but it shall be theatrical.","We all wish to be of importance in one way or another. The child coughs with might and main, since it has no other claim on the company.","It is doubtless a vice to turn one\'s eyes inward too much, but I am my own comedy and tragedy.","A sympathetic person is placed in the dilemma of a swimmer among drowning men, who all catch at him, and if he gives so much as a leg or a finger, they will drown him.","Man sheds grief as his skin sheds rain.","It is an esoteric doctrine of society, that a little wickedness is good to make muscle; as if conscience were not good for hands and legs.","A beautiful woman is a practical poet.","A woman\'s strength is the unresistible might of weakness.","War educates the senses, calls into action the will, perfects the physical constitution, brings men into such swift and close collision in critical moments that man measures man.","War, to sane men at the present day, begins to look like an epidemic insanity, breaking out here and there like the cholera or influenza, infecting men\'s brains instead of their bowels.","What is there of the divine in a load of brick? What ... in a barber shop? ... Much. All.","The life of labor does not make men, but drudges.","A poem, a sentence, causes us to see ourselves. I be, and I see my being, at the same time.","In youth, we clothe ourselves with rainbows, and go as brave as the zodiac.","Between cultivated minds the first interview is the best.","O friend, never strike sail to a fear! Come into port greatly, or sail with God the seas.","Europe extends to the Alleghenies; America lies beyond.","Englands genius filled all measureOf heart and soul, of strength and pleasure,Gave to the mind its emperor,And life was larger than before:Nor sequent centuries could hitOrbit and sum of Shakespeares wit. The men who lived with him becamePoets, for the air was fame.","Not gold but only men can makeA people great and strong;Men who for truth and honors sakeStand fast and suffer long.

The mind that grows could not predict the times, the means, the mode of that spontaneity. God enters by a private door into every individual.","Tis good-will makes intelligence.","London is the epitome of our times, and the Rome of to-day.","To believe in luck ... is skepticism.","No picture of life can have any veracity that does not admit the odious facts.

The details, the prose of nature, he should omit, and give us only the spirit and splendour.","An artist spends himself like the crayon in his hand, till he is all gone.","A man must be in sympathy with society around him, or else, not wish to be in sympathy with it.

There is no painful effort, but it is the spontaneous flowing of the thought. Shakespeare made his Hamlet as a bird weaves its nest.","The delicate muses lose their head if their attention is once diverted. Perhaps if you were successful abroad in talking and dealing with men, you would not come back to your bookshelf and your task. When the spirit chooses you for its scribe to publish some commandment, it makes you odious to men and men odious to you, and you shall accept that loathsomeness with joy. The moth must fly to the lamp, and you must solve those questions though you die.","The noblest ministry of nature is to stand as the apparition of God.","The best picture makes us say, I am a painter also.","Art is the need to create; but in its essence, immense and universal, it is impatient of working with lame or tied hands, and of making cripples and monsters, such as all pictures and statues are. Nothing less than the creation of man and nature is its end.","What if you do fail, and get fairly rolled in the dirt once or twice. Up again, you shall never be so afraid of a tumble.","None shall rule but the humble,And none but Toil shall have.","Blessed are those who have no talent!","All men are poets at heart.","Nor sequent centuries could hitOrbit and sum of Shakespeare\'s wit.","The nobler the truth or sentiment, the less imports the question of authorship.","Each mind has its own method.","There are two laws discreteNot reconciled,Law for man, and law for thing.","In actions of enthusiasm, this drawback appears: but in those lower activities, which have no higher aim than to make us more comfortable and more cowardly, in actions of cunning, actions that steal and lie, actions that divorce the speculative from the practical faculty, and put a ban on reason and sentiment, there is nothing else but drawback and negation.","None believeth in the soul of man, but only in some man or person old and departed.","The two parties which divide the State, the party of Conservatism and that of Innovation are very old, and have disputed the possession of the world ever since it was made ... Now one, now the other gets the day, and still the fight renews itself as if for the first time, under new names and hot personalities ... Innovation is the salient energy; Conservatism the pause on the last movement.","The writer, like a priest, must be exempted from secular labor. His work needs a frolic health; he must be at the top of his condition.","A great mind is a good sailor, as a great heart is.","Men are like Geneva watches with crystal faces, which expose the whole movement.","Moller, in his Essay on Architecture, taught that the building which was fitted accurately to answer its end would turn out to be beautiful, though beauty had not been intended. I find the like unity in human structures rather virulent and pervasive.","Some men at the approach of a dispute neigh like horses. Unless there be an argument, they think nothing is doing. Some talkers excel in the precision with which they formulate their thoughts, so that you get from them somewhat to remember; others lay criticism asleep by a charm. Especially women use words that are not words,--as steps in a dance are not steps,--but reproduce the genius of that they speak of; as the sound of some bells makes us think of the bell merely, whilst the church chimes in the distance bring the church and its serious memories before us.","The refining influence is the study of art, which is the science of beauty; and I find that every man values every scrap of knowledge in art, every observation of his own in it, every hint he has caught from another. For the laws of beauty are the beauty of beauty, and give the mind the same or a higher joy than the sight of it gives the senses. The study of art is of high value to the growth of the intellect.","It is hard to mesmerize ourselves, to whip our own top; but through sympathy we are capable of energy and endurance. Concert fires people to a certain fury of performance they can rarely reach alone.","The narrow sectarian cannot read astronomy with impunity. The creeds of his church shrivel like dried leaves at the door of the observatory.","The lover of letters loves power too.","Was never secret history but birds tell it in the bowers.","The borrower runs in his own debt.","Nothing will supply the want of sunshine to peaches, and, to make knowledge valuable, you must have the cheerfulness of wisdom. Whenever you are sincerely pleased you are nourished. The joy of the spirit indicates its strength. All healthy, things are sweet-tempered. Genius works in sport, and goodness smiles to the last.","What art can paint or gild any object in after life with the glow which nature gives to the first baubles of childhood? St. Peter\'s cannot have the magical power over us that the red and gold covers of our first picture-book possessed.","Christianity taught the capacity, the element, to love the All-perfect without a stingy bargain for personal happiness. It taught that to love Him was happiness;--to love Him in others\' virtues.","Earth endures; Stars abide.","A man comes to measure his greatness by the regrets, envies and hatreds of his competitors.","I always seem to suffer some loss of faith on entering cities.","The clergyman who lives in the city may have piety, but he must have taste.","Chiefly the sea-shore has been the point of departure to knowledge, as to commerce. The most advanced nations are always those who navigate the most.","If the gatherer gathers too-much, Nature takes out of the man what she puts into his chest; swells the estate, but kills the owner. Nature hates, monopolies and exceptions.","Universally, the better gold the worse man. The political economist defies us to show any gold mine country that is traversed by good roads, or a shore where pearls are found on which good schools are erected.","Consistency is the bugbear that frightens little minds.","The best of life is conversation.","O, when I am safe in my sylvan home,\\nI mock at the pride of Greece and Rome;\\nAnd when I am stretch\'d beneath the pines\\nWhen the evening star so holy shines,\\nI laugh at the lore and pride of man,\\nAt the Sophist\'s schools, and the learned clan;\\nFor what are they all in their high conceit,\\nWhen man in the bush with God may meet?","The Greek epigram intimates that the force of love is not shown by the courting of beauty, but where the like desire is inflamed for one who is ill-favored.","Culture implies all which gives the mind possession of its own powers, as languages to the critic, telescope to the astronomer. Culture alters the political status of an individual. It raises a rival royalty in a monarchy. \'Tis king against king. It is ever a romance of history in all dynasties--the co-presence of the revolutionary force in intellect. It creates a personal independence which the monarch cannot look down, and to which he must often succumb.","The foundation of culture, as of character, is at last the moral sentiment.","Ennui shortens life, and bereaves the day of its light.","This ennui, for which we Saxons had no name,--this word of France, has got a terrific significance. It shortens life, and bereaves the day of its light.","I do not know what arguments mean in reference to any expression of a thought. I delight in telling what I think; but if you ask me how I dare say so, or why it is so, I am the most helpless of men.","What is excellent,\\nAs God lives, is permanent;\\nHearts are dust, hearts\' loves remain,\\nHeart\'s love will meet thee again.","There is hope in extravagance, there is none in routine.","All the fairy tales of Aladdin, or the invisible Gyges, or the talisman that opens kings\' palaces, or the enchanted halls underground or in the sea, are only fictions to indicated the one miracle of intellectual enlargement.","There are faces so fluid with expression, so flushed and rippled by the play of thought, that we can hardly find what the mere features really are. When the delicious beauty of lineament loses its power, it is because a more delicious beauty has appeared, that an interior and durable form has been disclosed.","Faith makes us, and not we it; and faith makes its own forms.","The Americans have no faith, they rely on the power of a dollar; they are deaf to sentiment.","Fear is cruel and mean.","Man begins life helpless. The babe is in paroxysms of fear the moment its nurse leaves it alone, and it comes so slowly to any power of self-protection that mothers say the salvation of the life and health of a young child is a perpetual miracle.","Every novel is a debtor to Homer.","Friendship buys friendship.","Neither is life long enough for friendship. That is a serious and majestic affair.","There is a power in love to divine another\'s destiny better than that other can, and by heroic encouragements, hold him to his task. What has friendship so signal as its sublime attraction to whatever virtue is in us?","I hate the prostitution of the name of friendship to signify modish and worldly alliances.","There can never be deep peace between two spirits, never mutual respect, until, in their dialogue, each stands for the whole world.","My garden is a forest ledge\\nWhich older forest s bound;\\nThe banks slope down to the blue lake-edge,\\nThen plunge to depths profound!","Genius, even, as it is the greatest good, is he greatest harm.","There is genius as well in virtue as in intellect. \'Tis the doctrine of faith over works.","God knows that all sorts of gentlemen knock at the door; but whenever used in strictness and with any emphasis, the name will be found to point at original energy.","The flowering of civilization is the finished man, the man of sense, of grace, of accomplishment, of social power--the gentleman.","Our globe discovers its bidden virtues, not only in heroes and arch-angels, but in gossips and nurses.","We are disgusted by gossip; yet it is of importance to keep the angels in their proprieties.","I grieve that grief can teach me nothing, nor carry me one step into real nature.","Hither rolls the storm of heat;\\nI feel its finer billows beat\\nLike a sea which me infolds;\\nHeat with viewless fingers moulds,\\nSwells, and mellows, and matures,\\nPaints, and flavors, and allures,\\nBird and brier inly warms,\\nStill enriches and transforms,\\nGives the reed and lily length,\\nAdds to oak and oxen strength,\\nTransforming what it doth infold,\\nLife out of death, new out of old.","The heroic soul does not sell its justice and its nobleness. It does not ask to dine nicely and to sleep warm. The essence of greatness is the perception that virtue is enough. Poverty is its ornament. It does not need plenty, and can very well abide its loss.","The student is to read history actively and not passively; to esteem his own life the text, and books the commentary. Thus compelled, the muse of history will utter oracles as never to those who do not respect themselves.","No hope so bright but is the beginning of its own fulfilment.","The street is full of humiliations to the proud.","Time is indeed the theater and seat of illusions; nothing is so ductile and elastic. The mind stretches an hour to a century, and dwarfs an age to an hour.","When the boys come into my yard for leave to gather horse-chestnuts, I own I enter into nature\'s game, and affect to grant the permission reluctantly, fearing that any moment they will find out the imposture of that showy chaff. But this tenderness is quite unnecessary; the enchantments are laid on very thick. Their young life is thatched with them. Bare and grim to tears is the lot of the children in the hovel I saw yesterday; yet not the less they hang it round with frippery romance, like the children of the happiest fortune.","Our impatience of miles, when we are in a hurry; but it is still best that a mile should have seventeen hundred and sixty yards.","The beautiful laws of time and space, once dislocated by our inaptitude, are holes and dens. If the hive be disturbed by rash and stupid hands, instead of honey, it will yield us bees.","An actually existing fly is more important than a possibly existing angel.","It seems as if the day was not wholly profane in which we have given heed to some natural object.","An institution is the lengthened shadow of one man; as, monachism of the Hermit Anthony, the Reformation of Luther, Quakerism of Fox, Methodism of Wesley, abolition of Clarkson. Scipio, Milton called \\"the height of Rome;\\" and all history resolves itself easily into the biography of a few stout and earnest persons. Let a man, then, know his worth, and keep things under his feet.","Every great man is a unique. The Scipionism of Scipio is precisely that part he could not borrow.","Every individual nature has its own beauty. One is struck in every company, at every fireside, with the riches of nature, when he hears so many new tones, all musical, sees in each person original manners, which have a proper and peculiar charm, and reads new expressions of face. He perceives that nature has laid for each the foundations of a divine building, if the soul will build thereon.","Genius is intellect constructive.","Nature is good, but intellect is better, as the law-giver is before the law-receiver.","To be able to discern that what is true is true, and that what is false is false,--this is the mark and character of intelligence.","The intelligent have a right over the ignorant; namely, the right of instructing them.","It is frivolous to fix pedantically the date of particular inventions. They have all been invented over and over fifty times. Man is the arch machine, of which all these shifts drawn from himself are toy models. He helps himself on each emergency by copying or duplicating his own structure, just so far as then need is.","Every chair should be a throne and hold a king.","There is a property in the horizon which no man has, but he whose eyes can integrate all the parts,--that is, the poet.","Lawyers are a prudent race though not very fond of liberty.","Morality is the object of government.","Do not fear to put novels into the hands of young people as an occasional holiday experiment, but above all, good poetry in all kinds,--epic, tragedy, lyric. If we can touch the imagination, we serve them; they will never forget it.","Behold the Sea,\\nThe opaline, the plentiful and strong,\\nYet beautiful as is the rose in June,\\nFresh as the trickling rainbow of July;\\nSea full of food, the nourisher of kinds,\\nPurger of earth, and medicine of men;\\nCreating a sweet climate by my breath,\\nWashing out harms and griefs from memory,\\nAnd, in my mathematic ebb and flow,\\nGiving a hint of that which changes not.","Age, like woman, requires fit surroundings.","The masters painted for joy, and knew not that virtue had gone out of them. They could not paint the like in cold blood. The masters of English lyric wrote their songs so. It was a fine efflorescence of fine powers.","When we see a special reformer we feel like asking him, What right have you, sir, to your own virtue? Is virtue piecemeal?","Our poets are men of talents who sing, and not the children of music.","We first share the life by which things exist, and afterwards see them as appearances in nature, and forget that we have shared their cause.","An individual man is a fruit which it cost all the foregoing ages to form and ripen. He is strong, not to do, but to live; not in his arms, but in his heart; not as an agent, but as a fact.","Mankind divides itself into two classes,--benefactors and malefactors. The second class is vast; the first a handful.","Thought and knowledge are natures in which apparatus and pretension avail nothing. Gowns, and pecuniary foundations, though of towns of gold, can never countervail the least sentence or syllable of wit. Forget this, and out American colleges will recede in their public importance whilst they grow richer every year.","Good and bad are but names very readily transferable to that or this.","You must let go of a thing for a new one to come to you.","a good reader makes a good book","I have no expectation that any man will read history aright who thinks that what was done in a remote age, by men whose names have resounded far, has any deeper sense than what he is doing today.","The Bhagavad-Gita is an empire of thought and in its philosophical teachings Krishna has all the attributes of the full-fledged montheistic deity and at the same time the attributes of the Upanisadic absolute.","We are the children of many sires, and every drop of blood in us in its turn betrays its ancestor.","Universities are of course hostile to geniuses.","Astrology is astronomy brought down to Earth and applied toward the affairs of men.","The eyes of men converse as much as their tongues.","Among the map makers of each generation are the risk takers, those who see the opportunities, seize the moment and expand man\'s vision of the future","The charm of fine manners is music and sculpture and picture to many who do not pretend to appreciation of these arts.","Men such as they are, very naturally seek money or power; and power because it is as good as money.","Money often costs too much, and power and pleasure are not cheap.","The ragged cliff has thousand faces in a thousand hours.","Nature cannot be surprised in undress. Beauty breaks in everywhere.","Nature ever faithful is\\nTo such as trust her faithfulness.","Nature is a frugal mother, and never gives without measure. When she has work to do, she qualifies men for that and sends them equipped.","In every situation do the thing you fear. If you do the thing you fear, the death of fear is certain.","A beautiful soul always dwells in a beautiful world.","There comes a time in each man\'s education in which he comes to the conclusion that envy is ignorance, imitation is suicide, and society in in conspiracy against each one of its members.","The person who screams, or uses the superlative degree, or converses with heat puts whole drawing-rooms to flight. If you wish to be loved, love measure.","Only those books come down which deserve to last . All the gilt edges, vellum and morocco, all the presentation copies to all the libraries will not preserve a book in circulation beyond its intrinsic date.","Wisdom will never let us stand with any man on an unfriendly footing. We refuse sympathy and intimacy with people, as if we waited for some better sympathy or intimacy to come. But whence and when: Tomorrow will be like today. Life wastes itself while we are preparing to live.","He who does a good deed is instantly ennobled. He who does a mean deed is by the action itself contracted.","The worthless and offensive members of society, whose existence is a social pest, invariably think themselves the most ill-used people alive, and never get over their astonishment at the ingratitude and selfishness of their contemporaries.","The great man is not convulsible or tormentable; events pass over him without much impression.","A man in the wrong may more easily be convinced than one half right.","We thirst for approbation, yet cannot forgive the approver.","Dreams and beasts are two keys by which we find out the keys of our own nature.","Economy does not consist in saving the coal, but in using the time while it burns.","There are geniuses in trade as well as in war, or the state, or letters; and the reason why this or that man is fortunate is not to be told. It lies in the man: that is all anybody can tell you about it.","English history is aristocracy with the doors open. Who has courage and faculty, let him come in.","I am ashamed to see what a shallow village tale our so-called history is.","There is some reason to believe that when a man does not write his poetry it escapes by other vents through him, instead of the one vent of writing; clings to his form and manners, whilst poets have often nothing poetical about them except their verses.","Test of the poet is knowledge of love,\\nFor Eros is older than Saturn or Jove;\\nNever was poet, of late or of yore,\\nWho was not tremulous with love-lore.","Therefore we value the poet. All the argument and all the wisdom is not in the encyclopedia, or the treatise on metaphysics, or the Body of Divinity, but in the sonnet or the play.","We may climb into the thin and cold realm of pure geometry and lifeless science, or sink into that of sensation. Between these extremes is the equator of life, of thought, or spirit, or poetry,--a narrow belt.","And of poetry, the success is not attained when it lulls and satisfies, but when it astonishes and fires us with new endeavours after the unattainable.","Great is the art,\\nGreat be the manners, of the bard.\\nHe shall not his brain encumber\\nWith the coil of rhythm and number;\\nBut, leaving rule and pale forethought,\\nHe shall aye climb\\nFor his rhyme.\\n\\"Pass in, pass in,\\" the angels say","The rhyme of the poet\\nModulates the king\'s affairs.","The charming landscape which I saw this morning is indubitably made up of some twenty or thirty farms. Miller owns this field, Locke that, and Manning the woodland beyond. But none of them owns the landscape. There is property in the horizon which no man has but he whose eye can integrate all parts, that is, the poet. This is the best part of these men\'s farms, yet to this their warranty-deeds give no title.","To clothe the fiery thought\\nIn simple words succeeds,\\nFor still the craft of genius is\\nTo mask a king in weeds.","Men consort in camp and town\\nBut the poet dwells alone.","The poet needs a ground in popular tradition on which he may work, and which, again, may restrain his art within the due temperance. It holds him to the people, supplies a foundation for his edifice; and, in furnishing so much work done to his hand, leaves him at leisure, and in full strength for the audacities of his imagination.","A poet is no rattlebrain, saying what comes uppermost, and, because he says every thing, saying, at last, something good; but a heart in unison with his time and country. There is nothing whimsical or fantastic in his production, but sweet and sad earnest, freighted with the weightiest convictions, and pointed with the most determined aim which any man or class knows of in his times.","It is the essence of poetry to spring, like the rainbow daughter of Wonder, from the invisible, to abolish the past, and refuse all history.","Criticism is infested with the cant of materialism, which assumes that manual skill and activity is the first merit of all men, and disparages such as say and do not, overlooking the fact, that some men, namely, poets, are natural sayers, sent into the world to the end of expression, and confounds them with those whose province is action, but who quit to imitate the sayers.","Milton says, that the lyric poet may drink wine and live generously, but the epic poet, he who shall sing of the gods, and their descent unto men, must drink water out of a wooden bowl. For poetry is not \\"Devil\'s wine,\\" but God\'s wine.","To the birds and trees he talks:\\nCaesar of his leafy Rome,\\nThere the poet is at home.","For this present, hard\\nIs the fortune of the bard,\\nBorn out of time;\\nAll his accomplishment,\\nFrom Nature\'s utmost treasure spent,\\nBooteth not him.","A state of war or anarchy, in which law has little force, is so far valuable, that it puts every man on trial. The man of principle is known as such, and even in the fury of faction is respected.","In old Egypt, it was established law, that the vote of a prophet be reckoned equal to a hundred hands. I think it was much under-estimated.","The religion of England is part of good-breeding. When you see on the continent the well-dressed Englishman come into his ambassador\'s chapel and put his face for silent prayer into his smooth-brushed hat, you cannot help feeling how much national pride prays with him, and the religion of a gentleman.","But I go with my friend to the shore of our little river, and with one stroke of the paddle, I leave the village politics and personalities, yes, and the world of villages and personalities behind, and pass into a delicate realm of sunset and moonlight, too bright almost for spotted man to enter without novitiate and probation.","The primary wisdom is intuition. In that deep force, the last fact behind which analysis cannot go, all things find their origin.","I think it is the best of humanity that goes out to walk. In happy hours, I think all affairs may be wisely postponed for walking.","Draw, if thou canst, the mystic line,\\nSevering rightly his from thine,\\nWhich is human, which divine.","In nature, all is useful, all is beautiful. It is therefore beautiful, because it is alive, moving, reproductive; it is thereforeuseful, because it is symmetrical and fair. Beauty will not come at the call of a legislature, nor will it repeat in England or America its history in Greece. It will come, as always, unannounced, and spring up between the feet of brave and earnest men.","Beauty is the moment of transition, as if the form were just ready to flow into other forms.","A beautiful person among the Greeks, was thought to betray by this sign some secret favor of the immortal gods; and we can pardonpride, when a woman possesses such a figure that wherever she stands, or moves, or leaves a shadow on the wall, or sits for a portrait to the artist, she confers a favor on the world.","The most useful man in the most useful world, so long as only commodity was served, would remain unsatisfied. But, as fast as he sees beauty, life acquires a very high value.","Without the great arts which speak to the sense of beauty, a man seems to me a poor, naked, shivering creature. These are his becoming draperies, which warm and adorn him.","Beauty through my senses stole;\\nI yielded myself to the perfect whole.","That you are fair or wise is vain,\\nOr strong, or rich, or generous;\\nYou must have also the untaught strain\\nThat sheds beauty on the rose.","Personal beauty is then first charming and itself, when it dissatisfies us with any end; when it becomes a story without an end; when it suggests gleams and visions, and not earthly satisfactions; when it makes the beholder feel his unworthiness; when he cannot feel his right to it, though he were Caesar; he cannot feel more right to it than to the firmament and the splendors of a sunset.","Go out of the house to see the moon, and \'t is mere tinsel; it will not please as when its light shines upon your necessary journey. The beauty that shimmers in the yellow afternoons of October, who could ever clutch it? Go forth to find it, and it is gone: \'t is only a mirage as you look from the windows of diligence.","Thy dangerous glances\\nmake women of men;\\nnew-born, we are melting\\ninto nature again.","For the world is not painted, or adorned, but is from the beginning beautiful; and God has not made some beautiful things, but Beauty is the creator of the universe.","Aristotle and Plato are reckoned the respective heads of two schools. A wise man will see that Aristotle platonizes.","The new statement will comprise the skepticisms, as well as the faiths of society, and out of unbeliefs a creed shall be formed. For, skepticisms are not gratuitous or lawless, but are limitations of the affirmative statement, and the new philosophy must take them in, and make affirmations outside of them, just as much as must include the oldest beliefs.","Things bring their own philosophy with them, that is, prudence.","Each truth that a writer acquires is a lantern, which he turns full on what facts and thoughts lay already in his mind, and behold, all the mats and rubbish which had littered his garret become precious. Every trivial fact in his private biography becomes an illustration of this new principle, revisits the day, and delights all men by its piquancy and new charm.","Well, the world has a million writers. One would think, then, that good thought would be as familiar as air and water, and the gifts of each new hour would exclude the last. Yet we can count all our good books; nay, I remember any beautiful verse for twenty years.","Good writing is a kind of skating which carries off the performer where he would not go, and is only right admirable when to all its beauty and speed a subserviency to the will, like that of walking, is added.","A wise writer will feel that the ends of study and composition are best answered by announcing undiscovered regions of thought, and so communicating, through hope, new activity to the torpid spirit.","We postpone our literary work until we have more ripeness and skill to write, and we one day discover that our literary talent wasa youthful effervescence which we have now lost.","We are as much informed of a writer\'s genius by what he selects as by what he originates. We read the quotation with his eyes, andfind a new and fervent sense; as a passage from one of the poets, well recited, borrows new interest from the rendering. As the journals say, \\"the italics are ours.","The sentence must also contain its own apology for being spoken.","He that writes to himself writes to an eternal public. That statement only is fit to be made public, which you have come at in attempting to satisfy your own curiosity.","Best masters for the young writer and speaker are the fault- finding brothers and sisters at home who will not spare him, but willpick and cavil, and tell the odious truth.","The genius of the Platonists, is intoxicating to the student, yet how few particulars of it can I detach from all their books.","It is, in both cases, that a spiritual life has been imparted to nature; that the solid seeming block of matter has been pervadedand dissolved by a thought; that this feeble human being has penetrated the vast masses of nature with an informing soul, and recognised itself in their harmony, that is, seized their law. In physics, when this is attained, the memory disburthens itself of its cumbrous catalogues of particulars, and carries centuries of observation in a single formula.","The terrible tabulation of the French statists brings every piece of whim and humor to be reducible also to exact numerical ratios. If one man in twenty thousand, or in thirty thousand, eats shoes, or marries his grandmother, then, in every twenty thousand, or thirty thousand, is found one man who eats shoes, or marries his grandmother.","The universe is the externisation of the soul. Wherever the life is, that bursts into appearance around it. Our science is sensual, and therefore superficial. The earth, and the heavenly bodies, physics, and chemistry, we sensually treat, as if they were self-existent; but these are the retinue of that Being we have.","In the death of my son, now more than two years ago, I seem to have lost a beautiful estate,--no more. I cannot get it nearer to me.","Nothing is dead: men feign themselves dead, and endure mock funerals and mournful obituaries, and there they stand looking out ofthe window, sound and well, in some new and strange disguise.","Illusion, Temperament, Succession, Surface, Surprise, Reality, Subjectiveness,--these are the threads on the loom of time, these are the lords of life.","It is the same among the men and women, as among the silent trees; always a referred existence, an absence, never a presence and satisfaction. Is it, that beauty can never be grasped? In persons and in landscape is equally inaccessible?","There is a tendency in things to right themselves, and the war or revolution or bankruptcy that shatters rotten system, allows things to take a new and natural order.","Great genial power, one would almost say, consists in not being original at all; in being altogether receptive; in letting the world do all, and suffering the spirit of the hour to pass unobstructed through the mind.","Creative force, like a musical composer, goes on unweariedly repeating a simple air or theme, now high, now low, in solo, in chorus, ten thousand times reverberated, till it fills earth and heaven with the chant.","A song is no song unless the circumstance is free and fine. If a singer sing from a sense of duty or from seeing no way to escape,I had rather have none. Those only can sleep who do not care to sleep; and those only write or speak best who do not too much respect the writing or the speaking.","I have been told, that in some public discourses of mine my reverence for the intellect has made me unjustly cold to the personalrelations. But now I almost shrink at the remembrance of such disparaging words. For persons are love\'s world, and the coldest philosopher cannot recount the debt of the young soul wandering here in nature to the power of love, without being tempted to unsay, as treasonable to nature, aught derogatory to the social instincts.","Knowledge, Virtue, Power are the victories of man over his necessities, his march to the dominion of the world.","There is a relation between the hours of our life and the centuries of time. As the air I breathe is drawn from the great repositories of nature, as the light on my book is yielded by a star a hundred millions of miles distant, as the poise of my body depends on the equilibrium of centrifugal and centripetal forces, so the hours should be instructed by the ages and the ages explained by the hours.","Time, which shows so vacant, indivisible, and divine in its coming, is slit and peddled into trifles and tatters. A door is to bepainted, a lock to be repaired. I want wood, or oil, or meal, or salt; the house smokes, or I have a headache; then the tax; and an affair to be transacted with a man without heart or brains; and the stinging recollection of an injurious or very awkward word,--these eat up the hours.","Yet time and space are but inverse measures of the force of the soul. The spirit sports with time.","For the time of towns is tolled from the world by funereal chimes, but in nature the universal hours are counted by succeeding tribes of animals and plants, and by growth of joy on joy.","Painting seems to be to the eye what dancing is to the limbs. When that has educated the frame to self-possession, to nimbleness,to grace, the steps of the dancing-master are better forgotten; so painting teaches me the splendor of color and the expression of form, and as I see many pictures and higher genius in the art, I see the boundless opulence of the pencil, the indifferency in which the artist stands free to choose out of the possible forms.","Bring me wine, but wine which never grew\\nIn the belly of the grape","Of immortality, the soul, when well employed, is incurious. It is so well, that it is sure that it will be well. It asks no questions of the Supreme Power.","We learn that God IS; that he is in me; and that all things are shadows of him.","But the man and woman of seventy assume to know all, they have outlived their hope, they renounce aspiration, accept the actual for the necessary and talk down to the young. Let them then become organs of the Holy Ghost; let them be lovers; let them behold truth; and their eyes are uplifted, their wrinkles smoothed, they are perfumed again with hope and power.","Whoever has had the experience of the moral sentiment cannot choose but believe in unlimited power. Each pulse from that heart isan oath from the Most High. I know not what the word sublime means, if it be not the intimations, in this infant, of a terrific force.","The soul lets no man go without some visitations and holy-days of a diviner presence.","As every pool reflects the image of the sun, so every thought and thing restores us an image and creature of the supreme Good. Theuniverse is perforated by a million channels for his activity. All things mount and mount.","Let us stun and astonish the intruding rabble of men and books and institutions by a simple declaration of the divine fact. Bid the invaders take the shoes from off their feet, for God is here within.","The reverence for the deeds of our ancestors is a treacherous sentiment. Their merit was not to reverence the old, but to honor the present moment; and we falsely make them excuses of the very habit which they hated and defied.","You send your child to the schoolmaster, but \'tis the schoolboys who educate him. You send him to the Latin class, but much of histuition comes, on his way to school, from the shop- windows.","Can rules or tutors educate\\nThe semigod whom we await?\\nHe must be musical,\\nTremulous, impressional,\\nAlive to gentle influence\\nOf landscape and of sky\\nAnd tender to the spirit-touch\\nOf man\'s or maiden\'s eye.","The intelligent have a right over the ignorant, namely, the right of instructing them. The right punishment of one out of tune, isto make him play in tune; the fine which the good, refusing to govern, ought to pay, is, to be governed by a worse man; that his guards shall not handle gold and silver, but shall be instructed that there is gold and silver in their souls, which will make men willing to give them every thing which they need.","The intellect is vagabond, and our system of education fosters restlessness. Our minds travel when our bodies are forced to stay at home. We imitate; and what is imitation but the travelling of the mind?","If a teacher have any opinion which he wishes to conceal, his pupils will become as fully indoctrinated into that as into any which he publishes.","We see young men who owe us a new world, so readily and lavishly they promise, but they never acquit the debt; they die young anddodge the account: or if they live, they lose themselves in the crowd.","There is no great and no small\\nTo the Soul that maketh all.","All goes to show that the soul in man is not an organ, but animates and exercises all the organs; is not a function, like the power of memory, of calculation, of comparison, but uses these as hands and feet; is not a faculty, but a light, is not the intellect or the will, but the master of the intellect and the will; is the background of our being, in which they lie,--an immensity not possessed and that cannot be possessed.","The soul knows only the soul; the web of events is the flowing robe in which she is clothed.","The evolution of a highly destined society must be moral; it must run in the grooves of the celestial wheels.","If the vast and the spiritual are omitted, so are the practical and the moral.","The moral equalizes all; enriches, empowers all. It is the coin which buys all, and which all find in their pocket. Under the whipof the driver, the slave shall feel his equality with saints and heroes.","The lover never sees personal resemblances in his mistress to her kindred or to others. His friends find in her a likeness to hermother, or her sisters, or to persons not of her blood. The lover sees no resemblance except to summer evenings and diamond mornings, to rainbows and the song of birds.","Not always can flowers, pearls, poetry, protestations, nor even home in another heart, content the awful soul that dwells in clay.","Nothing can be more delicate without being fantastical, nothing more firm and based in nature and sentiment, than the courtship and mutual carriage of the sexes.","If with love thy heart has burned;\\nIf thy love is unreturned;\\nHide thy grief within thy breast,\\nThough it tear thee unexpressed.","Proverbs, like the sacred books of each nation, are the sanctuary of the intuitions. That which the droning world, chained to appearances, will not allow the realist to say in his own words, it will suffer him to say in proverbs without contradiction.","Proverbs, words, and grammar inflections convey the public sense with more purity and precision, than the wisest individual.","Pure by impure is not seen.","The senses interfere everywhere, and mix their own structure with all they report of.","Every man is actually weak, and apparently strong. To himself, he seems weak; to others, formidable.","If the black man is feeble and not important to the existing races, not on a parity with the best race, the black man must serve,and be exterminated. But if the black man carries in his bosom an indispensable element of a new and coming civilization; for the sake of that element, no wrong nor strength nor circumstance can hurt him: he will survive and play his part. So now, the arrival in the world of such men as Toussaint, and the Haytian heroes, or of the leaders of their race in Barbadoes and Jamaica, outweighs in good omen all the English and American humanity.","The spirit only can teach. Not any profane man, not any sensual, not any liar, not any slave can teach, but only he can give, whohas; he only can create, who is. The man on whom the soul descends, through whom the soul speaks, alone can teach. Courage, piety, love, wisdom, can teach; and every man can open his door to these angels, and they shall bring him the gift of tongues. But the man who aims to speak as books enable, as synods use, as the fashion guides, and as interest commands, babbles. Let him hush.","It is contended that those who have been bred at Eton, Harrow, Rugby, and Westminster, that the public sentiment within each of those schools is high-toned and manly; that, in their playgrounds, courage is universally admired, meanness despised, manly feelings and generous conduct are encouraged: that an unwritten code of honor deals to the spoiled child of rank, and to the child of upstart wealth an even-handed justice, purges their nonsense out of both, and does all that can be done to make them gentlemen.","What we commonly call man, the eating, drinking, planting, counting man, does not, as we know him, represent himself, but misrepresents himself. Him we do not respect, but the soul, whose organ he is, would he let it appear through his action, would make our knees bend.","The bulk of mankind believe in two gods. They are under one dominion here in the house, as friend and parent, in social circles, in letters, in art, in love, in religion; but in mechanics, in dealing with steam and climate, in trade, in politics, they think they come under another.","Beside all the small reasons we assign, there is a great reason for the existence of every extant fact; a reason which lies grandand immovable, often unsuspected behind it in silence.","Man is timid and apologetic; he is no longer upright; he dares not say \\"I think,\\" \\"I am,\\" but quotes some saint or sage.","Let the realist not mind appearances. Let him delegate to others the costly courtesies and decorations of social life. The virtuesare economists, but some of the vices are also. Thus, next to humility, I have noticed that pride is a pretty good husband. A good pride is, as I reckon it, worth from five hundred to fifteen hundred a year.","Pride can go without domestics, without fine clothes, can live in a house with two rooms, can eat potato, purslain, beans, lyed corn, can work on the soil, can travel afoot, can talk with poor men, or sit silent well contented with fine saloons. But vanity costs money, labor, horses, men, women, health and peace, and is still nothing at last; a long way leading nowhere.--Only one drawback; proud people are intolerably selfish, and the vain are gentle and giving.","He is a good man, who can receive a gift well. We are either glad or sorry at a gift, and both emotions are unbecoming.","We do not quite forgive a giver. The hand that feeds us is in some danger of being bitten. We can receive anything from love, forthat is a way of receiving it from ourselves; but not from any one who assumes to bestow. We sometimes hate the meat which we eat, because there seems something of degrading dependence in living it.","If, at any time, it comes into my head, that a present is due from me to somebody, I am puzzled what to give, until the opportunity is gone.","My hours are peaceful centuries.","Cowardice shuts the eyes till the sky is not larger than a calf-skin: shuts the eyes so that we cannot see the horse that is running away with us; worse, shuts the eyes of the mind and chills the heart.","Whilst all the world is in pursuit of power, culture corrects the theory of success.","Every true man is a cause, a country, and an age; requires infinite spaces and numbers and time fully to accomplish his design;--and posterity seem to follow his steps as a train of clients.","Men of extraordinary success, in their honest moments, have always sung, \\"Not unto us, not unto us.\\" According to the faith of their times, they have built altars to Fortune, or to Destiny, or to St. Julian. Their success lay in their parallelism to the course of thought, which found in them an unobstructed channel; and the wonders of which they were the visible conductors seemed to their eye their deed.","The cold, inconsiderate of persons, tingles your blood, benumbs your feet, freezes a man like an apple.","There are many eyes that can detect and honor the prudent and household virtues; there are many that can discern Genius on his starry track, though the mob is incapable; but when that love which is all-suffering, all-abstaining, all-aspiring, which has vowed to itself, that it will be a wretch and also a fool in this world, sooner than soil its white hands by any compliances, comes into our streets and houses,--only the pure and aspiring can know its face, and the only compliment they can pay it, is to own it.","The idealism of Berkeley is only a crude statement of the idealism of Jesus, and that again is a crude statement of the fact thatall nature is the rapid efflux of goodness executing and organizing itself.","The dogma of the mystic offices of Christ being dropped, and he standing on his genius as a moral teacher, \'tis impossible to maintain the old emphasis of his personality; and it recedes, as all persons must, before the sublimity of the moral laws.","But the mark of American merit in painting, in sculpture, in poetry, in fiction, in eloquence, seems to be a certain grace withoutgrandeur, and itself not new but derivative; a vase of fair outline, but empty,--which whoso sees, may fill with what wit and character is in him, but which does not, like the charged cloud, overflow with terrible beauty, and emit lightnings on all beholders.","The Americans have many virtues, but they have not Faith and Hope. I know no two words whose meaning is more lost sight of.","The American who has been confined, in his own country, to the sight of buildings designed after foreign models, is surprised on entering York Minster or St. Peter\'s at Rome, by the feeling that these structures are imitations also,--faint copies of an invisible archetype.","As long as our people quote English standards they dwarf their own proportions.","Luckily for us, now that steam has narrowed the Atlantic to a strait, the nervous, rocky West is intruding a new and continental element into the national mind, as we shall yet have an American genius.","Let a man attain the highest and broadest culture that any American has possessed, then let him die by sea-storm, railroad collision, or other accident, and all America will acquiesce that the best thing has happened to him; that, after the education has gone far, such is the expensiveness of America, that the best use to put a fine person to is to drown him to save his board.","Physical force has no value, where there is nothing else. Snow in snow-banks, fire in volcanoes and solfataras is cheap. The luxury of ice is in tropical countries, and midsummer days. The luxury of fire is, to have a little on our hearth; and of electricity, not the volleys of the charged cloud, but the manageable stream on the battery-wires. So of spirit, or energy; the rests or remains of it in the civil and moral man, are worth all the cannibals in the Pacific.","There is no king or sovereign state\\nThat can fix a hero\'s rate;\\nEach to all is venerable.","The hero sees that the event is ancillary: it must follow him.","The hero is a mind of such balance that no disturbances can shake his will, but pleasantly, and, as it were, merrily, he advancesto his own music, alike in frightful alarms and in the tipsy mirth of universal dissoluteness.","Times of heroism are generally times of terror, but the day never shines in which this element may not work.","But whoso is heroic will always find crises to try his edge.","Savages cling to a local god of one tribe or town. The broad ethics of Jesus were quickly narrowed to village theologies, which preach an election or favoritism.","A few years ago, the liberal churches complained that the Calvinistic church denied to them the name of Christian. I think the complaint was confession; a religious church would not complain.","The reverence for the Scriptures is an element of civilization, for thus has the history of the world been preserved, and is preserved.","Do not shut up the young people against their will in a pew, and force the children to ask them questions for an hour against their will.","The Church seems to totter to its fall, almost all life extinct. On this occasion, any complaisance would be criminal which told you, whose hope and commission it is to preach the faith of Christ, that the faith of Christ is preached.","To aim to convert a man by miracles is a profanation of the soul. A true conversion, a true Christ, is now, as always, to be madeby the reception of beautiful sentiments.","But to most of us society shows not its face and eye, but its side and back. To stand in true relations with men in a false age isworth a fit of insanity, is it not?","I pray my companion, if he wishes for bread, to ask me for bread, and if he wishes for sassafras or arsenic, to ask me for them, and not to hold out his plate, as if I knew already.","Strange is this alien despotism of Sleep which takes two persons lying in each other\'s arms & separates them leagues, continents,asunder.","Sleep takes off the costume of circumstance, arms us with terrible freedom, so that every will rushes to a deed.","We sell the thrones of angels for a short and turbulent pleasure.","The richest of all lords is Use,\\nAnd ruddy Health the loftiest Muse.\\nLive in the sunshine, swim the sea,\\nDrink the wild air\'s salubrity.","Pain is superficial, and therefore fear is. The torments of martyrdoms are probably most keenly felt by the by-standers.","I wish to speak with all respect of persons, but sometimes I must pinch myself to keep awake, and preserve the due decorum. They melt so fast into each other, that they are like grass and trees, and it needs an effort to treat them as individuals.","Life must be lived on a higher plane. We must go up to a higher platform, to which we are always invited to ascend; there, the whole aspect of things changes.","For everything you gain, you lose something.","It is very certain that the strong British race which has now overrun much of this continent, must also overrun [Texas], and Mexico and Oregon also, and it will in the course of ages be of small import by what particular occasions and methods it was done.","The purpose of life seems to be to acquaint a man with himself and whatever science or art or course of action he engages in reacts upon and illuminates the recesses of his own mind. Thus friends seem to be only mirrors to draw out and explain to us ourselves; and that which draws us nearer our fellow man, is, that the deep Heart in one, answers the deep Heart in another, - that we find we have (a common Nature) - one life which runs through all individuals, and which is indeed Divine.","In the country, without any interference from the law, the agricultural life favors the permanence of families.","Why should we assume the faults of our friend, or wife, or father, or child, because they sit around our hearth, or are said to have the same blood?","Perhaps it is the lowest of the qualities of an orator, but it is, on so many occasions, of chief importance,--a certain robust and radiant physical health; or--shall I say?--great volumes of animal heat.","The right eloquence needs no bell to call the people together, and no constable to keep them.","Eloquence must be grounded on the plainest narrative. Afterwards, it may warm itself until it exhales symbols of every kind and color, speaks only through the most poetic forms; but first and last, it must still be at bottom a biblical statement of fact.","But a public oration is an escapade, a non-committal, an apology, a gag, and not a communication, not a speech, not a man.","We learn geology the morning after the earthquake, on ghastly diagrams of cloven mountains, upheaved plains, and the dry bed of the sea.","Democracy is morose, and runs to anarchy, but in the state, and in the schools, it is indispensable to resist the consolidation ofall men into a few men.","We honor the rich because they have externally the freedom, power, and grace which we feel to be proper to man, proper to us.","The advantage of riches remains with him who procured them, not with the heir.","Conservatism is affluent and openhanded, but there is a cunning juggle in riches. I observe that they take somewhat for everythingthey give. I look bigger, but am less; I have more clothes, but am nit so warm; more armor, but less courage; more books, but less wit.","The socialism of our day has done good service in setting men to thinking how certain civilizing benefits, now only enjoyed by theopulent, can be enjoyed by all.","He is the rich man in whom the people are rich, and he is the poor man in whom the people are poor; and how to give access to themasterpieces of art and nature, is the problem of civilization.","A man should not go where he cannot carry his whole sphere or society with him,Mnot bodily, the whole circle of his friends, but atmospherically. He should preserve in a new company the same attitude of mind and reality of relation, which his daily associates draw him to, else he is shorn of his best beams, and will be an orphan in the merriest club.","Religious literature has eminent examples, and if we run over our private list of poets, critics, philanthropists and philosophers, we shall find them infected with this dropsy and elephantiasis, which we ought to have tapped.","An expense of ends to means is fate;Morganization tyrannizing over character. The menagerie, or forms and powers of the spine, is a book of fate: the bill of the bird, the skull of the snake, determines tyrannically its limits.","So in accepting the leading of the sentiments, it is not what we believe concerning the immortality of the soul, or the like, but the universal impulse to believe, that is the material circumstance, and is the principal fact in this history of the globe.","I knew a witty physician who found theology in the biliary duct, and used to affirm that if there was a disease in the liver, the man became a Calvinist, and if that organ was sound, he became a Unitarian.","But what help from these fineries or pedantries? What help from thought? Life is not dialectics. We, I think, in these times, have had lessons enough of the futility of criticism.","I find it more credible, since it is anterior information, that one man should know heaven, as the Chinese say, than that so many men should know the world.","A right rule for a club would be,-Admit no man whose presence excludes any one topic.","The only compensation which war offers for its manifold mischiefs, is in the great personal qualities to which it gives scope and occasion.","I take this evanescence and lubricity of all objects, which lets them slip through our fingers then when we clutch hardest, to be the most unhandsome part of our condition.","Tis the old secret of the gods that they come in low disguises. \'Tis the vulgar great who come dizened with gold and jewels. Real kings hide away their crowns in their wardrobes, and affect a plain and poor exterior.","I find it a great and fatal difference whether I court the Muse, or the Muse courts me. That is the ugly disparity between age and youth.","Our debt to tradition through reading and conversation is so massive, our protest so rare and insignificant-and this commonly on the ground of other reading and hearing-that in large sense, one would say there is no pure originality. All minds quote. Old and new make the warp and woof of every moment. There is no thread that is not a twist of these two strands. By necessity, by proclivity, and by delight, we all quote. It is as difficult to appropriate the thoughts of others as it is to invent.","All life is an experiment. Place yourself in the middle of the stream of power and wisdom which animates all whom it floats, and you are without effort impelled to truth, to right and a perfect contentment. I wish to write such rhymes as shall not suggest a restraint, but contrariwise the wildest freedom. Immortality. I notice that as soon as writers broach this question they begin to quote. I hate quotation. Tell me what you know.","Where the banana grows man is sensual and cruel.","The Nonchalance of boys who are sure of a dinner, and would disdain as much as a lord to do or say aught to conciliate one, is the healthy attitude of human nature.","No facts to me are sacred; none are profane.","How can we speak of the action of the mind under any divisions, as of its knowledge, of its ethics, of its works, and so forth, since it melts will into perception, knowledge into act? Each becomes the other. Itself alone is.","If I am the devil\'s child, I will live then, by the devil.","Every day, the sun; and, after sunset, night and her stars. Ever the winds blow; ever the grass grows. Every day, men and women, conversing, beholding and beholden. The scholar is he of all men whom this spectacle most engages. He must settle its value in his mind. What is nature to him?","The have a good friend is one of the greatest delights of life.","I will do strongly before the sun and moon whatever inly rejoices me and the heart apoints.","Two sorts of writers possess genius: those who think, and those who cause others to think.","Literature is eavesdropping.","Foolish consistencies are the hobgoblins of small minds!","The voyage of the best ship is a zigzag line of a hundred tacks. See the line from a sufficient distance and it straightens itself to the average tendency.","In excited conversation we have glimpses of the universe, hints of power native to the soul, far-darting lights and shadows of an Andes landscape, such as we can hardly attain in lone meditation. Here are oracles sometimes profusely given, to which the memory goes back in barren hours.","That which we are, we are all the while teaching, not voluntarily, but involuntarily.","Beware of jokes from which we go away hollow and ashamed.","All natural objects make a kindred impression, when the mind is open to their influence.","Go cherish your soul; express companions; set your habits to a life of solitude; then will the faculties rise fair and full within.","The Same, the Same: friend and foe are of one stuff; the ploughman, the plough, and the furrow, are of one stuff; and the stuff is such, and so much, that the variations of form are unimportant.","The terrors of the child are quite reasonable, and add to his loveliness; for his utter ignorance and weakness, and his enchanting indignation on such a small basis of capital compel every bystander to take his part.","Art is evidence of our most creative moment.","For every seeing soul, there are two absorbing facts - I, and the abyss.","Don\'t ever give up on something or someone that you can\'t go a full day without thinking about.","Plant your DREAMS and miracles will grow.","The case wouldn\'t be overweight if you didn\'t have so many shoes. How many do you really need? This pair, for example, I swear you never even wore them.","If the whole of history is in one man, it is all to be explained from individual experience.","Men love to wonder, and that is the seed of our science, and such is the mechanical determination of our age, and so recent are our best contrivances, that use has not dulled our joy and pride in them. These arts open great gates of a future, promising to make the world plastic and to lift human life out of its beggary to a godlike ease and power.","The kitchen clock is more convenient than sidereal time. We must use the popular category, as we do by the Linn\xe6an classification, for convenience, and not as exact and final. Otherwise, we are presently confounded, when the best-settled traits of one race are claimed by some new ethnologist as precisely characteristic of the rival tribe.","I confess myself utterly at a loss in suggesting particular reforms in our ways of teaching. No discretion that can be lodged with a school-committee, with the overseers or visitors of an academy, of a college, can at all avail to reach these difficulties and perplexities, but they solve themselves when we leave institutions and address individuals.","It sometimes occurs that memory has a personality of its own and volunteers or refuses its information at its will, not at mine.","The babe in arms is a channel through which the energies we call fate, love, and reason visibly stream.","The etymologist finds the deadest word to have been once a brilliant picture.","The glance is natural magic. The mysterious communication established across a house between two entire strangers, moves all the springs of wonder.","The unsaid part is the best of every discourse.","What omniscience has music! So absolutely impersonal, and yet every sufferer feels his secret sorrow soothed.","It must be that when God speaketh, he should communicate, not one thing, but all things; should fill the world with his voice; should scatter forth light, nature, time, souls, from the centre of the present thought; and new date and new create the whole.Whenever a mind is simple and receives a divine wisdom, old things pass away, - means, teachers, texts, temples fall; it lives now, and absorbs past and future into the present hour.  All things are made sacred by relation to it,-one as much as another.  All things are disolved to ther center by thier cause.","The soul raised over passion beholds identity and eternal causation, perceives the self-existance of Truth and Right, and calms itself with knowing that all things go well.","A man must know how to estimate a sour face.  The sour face of the multitude, like thier sweet faces, have no deep cause, but are put on and off as the wind blows and the newspaper directs.","My tongue is prone to lose the way,Not so my pen, for in a letterWe have not better things to say,But surely put them better.","The Sun is the sole inconsumable fireAnd God is the sole inexhaustible Giver.","I appeal from your customs. I must be myself. I cannot break myself anylonger for you, or you. If you can love me for what I am, we shall bethe happier. If you cannot, I will still seek to deserve that youshould. I will not hide my tastes or aversions. I will so trust thatwhat is deep is holy, that I will do strongly before the sun and moonwhatever inly rejoices me, and the heart appoints. If you are noble, Iwill love you; if you are not, I will not hurt you and myself byhypocritical attentions. If you are true, but not in the same truthwith me, cleave to your companions; I will seek my own.","Friendship, like the immortality of the soul, is too good to be believed.","Our faith comes in moments; our vice is habitual.","The man of genius inspires us with a boundless confidence in our own powers.","Every known fact in natural science was divined by the presentiment of somebody, before it was actually verified.","Who hears me, who understands me, becomes mine, a possession for all time.","It is my desire, in the office of a Christian minister, to do nothing which I cannot do with my whole heart. Having said this, I have said all.","Beauty is an outward gift, which is seldom despised, except by those to whom it has been refused.","I have no hostility to nature, but a child\'s love to it. I expand and live in the warm day like corn and melons.","People that seem so glorious are all show; underneath they are like everyone else.","Why need I volumes, if one word suffice?","The value of a dollar is social, as it is created by society.","Every industrious man, in every lawful calling, is a useful man. And one principal reason why men are so often useless is that they neglect their own profession or calling, and divide and shift their attention among a multiplicity of objects and pursuits.","Manners are the happy ways of doing things; each one a stroke of genius or of love, now repeated and hardened into usage, they form at last a rich varnish, with which the routine of life is washed, and its details adorned. If they are superficial, so are the dew-drops which give such a depth to the morning meadows.","Only so much of life do I know as I have lived.","We talk of choosing our friends, but friends are self-elected.","Rings and other jewels are not gifts, but apologies for gifts. The only gift is a portion of thyself.","The law of nature is alternation for evermore. Each electrical state superinduces the opposite. The soul environs itself with friends, that it may enter into a grander self-acquaintance or solitude; and it goes alone for a season, that it may exalt its conversation or society.","Let us even bid our dearest friends farewell, and defy them, saying, \\"Who are you? Unhand me: I will be dependent no more.\\" Ah! seest thou not, O brother, that thus we part only to meet again on a higher platform, and only be more each other\'s, because we are more our own?","Imagination is a very high sort of seeing.","When I read a good book, I wish my life were three thousand years long.","I believe in Eternity. I can find Greece, Palestine, Italy, Spain, and the Islands, - the Genius and creative Principle of each and of all eras, in my own mind.","When you were born you were crying and everyone else was smiling. Live your life so at the end, your\'re the one who is smiling and everyone else is crying.","All history is biography.","Doing well is a result of doing good.","I am at a loss to understand why people hold Miss Austen\'s novels at so high a rate, which seem to me vulgar in tone, sterile in artistic invention, imprisoned in their wretched conventions of English society, without genius, wit, or knowledge of the world. Never was life so pinched and narrow. ... All that interests in any character [is this]: has he (or she) the money to marry with? ... Suicide is more respectable.","Tis the good reader that makes the good book; a good head cannot read amiss: in every book he finds passages which seem confidences or asides hidden from all else and unmistakeably meant for his ear.","Go oft to the house of thy friend, for weeds choke the unused path.","Build therefore your own world.","Whoso would be a man, must be a nonconformist. He who would gather immortal palms must not be hindered by the name of goodness, but must explore it if it be goodness. Nothing is at last sacred but the integrity of your own mind. Absolve you to yourself, and you shall have the suffrage of the world.","Of all the ways to lose a person, death is the kindest","The maker of a sentence launches out into the infinite and builds a road into Chaos and old Night, and is followed by those who hear him with something of wild, creative delight.","In the vaunted works of Art, The master-stroke is Nature\'s part.","Love not the flower they pluck and know it not, And all their botany is Latin names.","Peace has its victories, but it takes brave men and women to win them.","The true poem is the poet\'s mind.","For it is not metres, but a metre-making argument that makes a poem.","All the world loves a lover.","A friend, therefore, is a sort of paradox in nature. I who alone am, I who see nothing in nature whose existence I can affirm with equal evidence to my own, behold now the semblance of my being, in all its height, variety, and curiosity, reiterated in a foreign form; so that a friend may well be reckoned the masterpiece of nature.","In the right hands, literature is not resorted to as a consolation, and by the broken and decayed, but as a decalogue.","A collector recently bought at public auction, in London, for one hundred and fifty-seven guineas, an autograph of Shakespeare; but for nothing a school-boy can read Hamlet and can detect secrets of highest concernment yet unpublished therein.","There is then creative reading as well as creative writing. When the mind is braced by labor and invention, the page of whatever book we read becomes luminous with manifold allusion. Every sentence is doubly significant, and the sense of our author is as broad as the world.","They think him the best dressed man, whose dress is so fit for his use that you cannot notice or remember to describe it.","Frankness invites frankness.","There is ever a slight suspicion of the burlesque about earnest good men.","Nature forever puts a premium on reality. What is done for effect is seen to be done for effect; what is done for love is felt to be done for love. A man inspires affection and honor because he was not lying in wait for these.","In the history of the individual is always an account of his condition, and he knows himself to be a party to his present estate.","History is the action and reaction of these two, nature and thought.","A man must ride alternately on the horses of his private and his public nature.","The chief value of the new fact is to enhance the great and constant fact of life.","The great man, that is, the man most imbued with the spirit of the time, is the impressionable man.","Let us replace sentimentalism by realism and dare to uncover those simple and terrible laws which, be they seen or unseen, pervade and govern.","There is no better way to exercise the imagination than the study of the law.","A man known to us only as a celebrity in politics or in trade, gains largely in our esteem if we discover that he has some intellectual taste or skill.","The dead sleep in their moonless night; my business is with the living.","Manners make the fortune of the ambitious youth.","There is nothing settled in manners, but the laws of behavior yield to the energy of the individual.","Good breeding, a union of kindness and independence.","Every man has a vocation. The talent is the call.","The populace drags down the gods to their own level.","A cultivated man, wise to know and bold to perform, is the end to which nature works.","Man is physical as well as metaphysical, a thing of shreds and patches, borrowed unequally from good and bad ancestors, and a misfit from the start.","Solvency is maintained by means of a national debt, on the principle, \\"If you will not lend me the money, how can I pay you?\\"","Cannot we let [children] be themselves, and enjoy life in their own way? You are trying to make another you. One\'s enough.","One definition of man is an intelligence served by organs.","All writing comes by the grace of God.","Let the reader find that he cannot afford to omit any line of your writing because you you have omitted every word that he can spare.","The language of the street is always strong.","So in writing, there is always a right word, and every other than that is wrong. There is no beauty in words except in their collocation. The effect of a fanciful word misplaced, is like that of a horn of exquisite polish growing on a human head.","For what are they all in their high conceit, When man in the bush with God may meet?","Power dwells with cheerfulness.","He thought it happier to be dead, To die for Beauty, than live for bread","I do then with my friends as I do with my books. I would have them where I can find them, but I seldom use them.","Many photographers think they are photographing nature when they are only caricaturing her.","\\"Though many painters and sculptors talk glibly of \\"going in for photography,\\" you will find that very few of them can ever make a picture by photography; they lack the science, technical knowledge, and above all the practice. Most people think they can play tennis, shoot, write novels, and photograph as well as any other person - until they try.\\"","\\"Do not call yourself an \\"artist-photographer\\" and make \\"artist-painters\\" and \\"artist-sculptors\\" laugh; call yourself a photographer and wait for artists to call you brother.\\"","Nature is saturated with Deity.","Nature is a rag-merchant, who works up every shred and ort and end into new creations; like a good chemist, whom I found, the other day, in his laboratory, converting his old shirts into pure white sugar.","Power is in nature the essential measure of right.","Nature is no sentimentalist, - does not cosset or pamper us. We must see that the world is rough and surly, and will not mind drowning a man or a woman; but swallows your ship like a grain of dust. The cold, inconsiderate of persons, tingles your blood, benumbs your feet, freezes a man like an apple. The diseases, the elements, fortune, gravity, lightning, respect no persons.","Nature is a tropical swamp in sunshine, on whose purlieus we hear the song of summer birds, and see prismatic dewdrops, - but her interiors are terrific, full of hydras and crocodiles.","As I walked in the woods I felt what I often feel that nothing can befall me in life, no calamity, no disgrace (leaving me my eyes) to which Nature will not offer a sweet consolation. Standing on the bare ground with my head bathed by the blithe air, & uplifted into the infinite space, I become happy in my universal relations. The name of the nearest friend sounds then foreign & accidental. I am the heir of uncontained beauty and power.","I thought as I rode in the cold pleasant light of Sunday morning how silent & passive nature offers, every morn, her wealth to man; she is immensely rich, he is welcome to her entire goods, which he speaks no word, only leaves over doors ajar, hall, store room, & cellar. He may do as he will: if he takes her hint & uses her goods, she speaks no word; if he blunders & starves, she says nothing.","At the gates of the forest, the surprised man of the world is forced to leave his city estimates of great and small, wise and foolish.","It is very odd that Nature should be so unscrupulous. She is no saint . . .","I fear the popular notion of success stands in direct opposition in all points to the real and wholesome success. One adores public opinion, the other, private opinion; one, fame, the other, desert; one, feats, the other, humility; one, lucre, the other, love; one, monopoly, and the other, hospitality of mind.","Excellence is the new forever.","The death of a dear friend, wife, brother, lover, which seemed nothing but privation, somewhat later assumes the aspect of a guide or genius; for it commonly operates revolutions in our way of life, terminates an epoch of infancy or of youth which was waiting to be closed, breaks up a wonted occupation, or a household, or style of living, and allows the formation of new ones more friendly to the growth of character.","Up and away for life! be fleet!-\\nThe frost-king ties my fumbling feet,\\nSings in my ears, my hands are stones,\\nCurdles the blood to the marble bones,\\nTugs at the heart-strings, numbs the sense,\\nAnd hems in life with narrowing fence.\\nWell, in this broad bed lie and sleep,-\\nThe punctual stars will vigil keep,-\\nEmbalmed by purifying cold;\\nThe winds shall sing their dead-march old,\\nThe snow is no ignoble shroud,\\nThe moon thy mourner, and the cloud.","It is very hard to be simple enough to be good.","The basis of good manners is self-reliance.","Some natures are too good to be spoiled by praise.","The intellectual man requires a fine bait; the sots are easily amused. But everybody is drugged with his own frenzy, and the pageant marches at all hours, with music and banner and badge.","We rail at trade, but the historian of the world will see that it was the principle of liberty; that it settled America, and destroyed feudalism, and made peace and keeps peace; that it will abolish slavery.","All history is a record of the power of minorities, and of minorities of one.","Slavery it is that makes slavery; freedom, freedom. The slavery of women happened when the men were slaves of kings.","Tis the old secret of the gods that they come in low disguises.","The soul of God is poured into the world through the thoughts of men.","Beauty rests on necessities.","A man\'s personal defects will commonly have with the rest of the world precisely that importance which they have to himself. If he makes light of them, so will other men.","A life in harmony with nature, the love of truth and virtue, will purge the eyes to understanding her text.","All necessary truth is its own evidence.","Congratulate yourself if you have done something strange, extravagant and broken the monotony.","Man is a shrewd inventor, and is ever taking the hint of a new machine from his own structure, adapting some secret of his own anatomy in iron, wood, and leather, to some required function in the work of the world.","If you will not lend me the money, how can I pay you?","The lover of nature is he whose inward and outward senses\\n are still truly adjusted to each other.","There is one mind common to all individual men","We but half express ourselves, and are ashamed of that divine idea which each of us represents. It may be safely trusted as proportionate and of good issues, so it be faithfully imparted, but God will not have his work made manifest by cowards.","The merit claimed for the Anglican Church is that,\\nif you let it alone,\\nit will let you alone.","Let there be worse cotton and better men.","When you have worn out yourshoes, the strength of the shoe leather has passed into the fiber ofyour body.  I measure your health by the number of shoes and hats andclothes you have worn out.","THE POET A moody child and wildly wise Pursued the game with joyful eyes, Which chose, like meteors, their way, And rived the dark with private ray: They overleapt the horizon\'s edge, Searched with Apollo\'s privilege; Through man, and woman, and sea, and star, Saw the dance of nature forward far; Through worlds, and races, and terms, and times, Saw musical order, and pairing rhymes. Olympian bards who sung Divine ideas below, Which always find us young, And always keep us so.","As soon as a child has left the room his strewn toys become affecting.","We must set up a strong present tense against all rumors of wrath, past and to come.","The book, the college, the school of art, the institution of any kind, stop with some past utterance of genius. . . . They look backward and not forward. But genius looks forward: the eyes of man are set in his forehead, not in his hindhead: man hopes: genius creates. Whatever talents may be, if the man create not, the pure efflux of the Deity is not his; - cinders and smoke there may be, but not yet flame.","Friendship is an order of nobility; from its revelations we come more worthily into nature.","Consider what you have in the smallest well-chosen library-a company of the wisest and wittiest men which can be plucked out of all civilized countries in a thousand years. The men themselves were then hidden and inaccessible. They were solitary, impatient of interruption, and fenced by etiquette. But now they are immortal, and the thought they did not reveal, even to their bosom friends, is here written out in transparent words of light to us, who are strangers of another age.","Cunning is strength withheld.","We want men and women who shall renovate life and our social state but we see that most natures are insolvent, cannot satisfy their own wants, have an ambition out of all proportion to their practical force, and so do lean and beg day and night continually.","The life of man is a self-evolving circle.","Life is a search after power.","In the hands of the discoverer, medicine becomes a heroic art . . wherever life is dear he is a demigod.","He walks abreast with his days and feels no shame in not \'studying a profession\', for he does not postpone his life, but lives already. He has not one chance, but a hundred chances.","Life is too short to waste . . . \'Twill soon be dark; Up! mind thine own aim, and God speed the mark!","Great men, great nations, have not been boasters and buffoons, but perceivers of the terror of life, and have manned themselves to face it.","Every man is a borrower and a mimic, life is theatrical and literature a quotation.","The world is a divine dream, from which we may presently awake to the glories and certainties of day.","The walls of rude minds are scrawled all over with facts, with thoughts. They shall one day bring a lantern and read the inscriptions.","What a searching preacher of self-command is the varying phenomenon of health.","We estimate the wisdom of nations by seeing what they did with their surplus capital.","Consideration is the soil in which wisdom may be expected to grow, and strength be given to every up-springing plant of duty.","We walk alone in the world. Friends, such as we desire, are dreams and fables.","Our eyes are holden that we cannot see things that stare us in the face, until the hour arrives when the mind is ripened; then we behold them, and the time when we saw them not is like a dream.","Though love repine, and reason chafe, There came a voice without reply,- \\"\'Tis man\'s perdition to be safe, When for the truth he ought to die.\\"","Four snakes gliding up and down a hollow for no purpose that I could see - not to eat, not for love, but only gliding.","Never lose an opportunity to see anything that is beautiful. It is God\'s handwriting a wayside sacrament. Welcome it in every fair face, every fair sky, every fair flower.","The hand that rounded Peter\'s dome, And groined the aisles of Christian Rome, Wrought in a sad sincerity; Himself from God he could not free; He builded better than he knew: The conscious stone to beauty grew.","Law of Contrariness: Our chief want in life is somebody who shall make us do what we can. Having found them, we shall then hate them for it.","Go, speed the stars of Thought On to their shining goals; - The sower scatters broad his seed, The wheat thou strew\'st be souls.","Thought is the seed of action; but action is as much its second form as thought is its first. It rises in thought, to the end that it may be uttered and acted. Always in proportion to the depth of its sense does it knock importunately at the gates of the soul, to be spoken, to be done.","Hence, instead of Man Thinking, we have the bookworm. Hence, the book-learned class, who value books, as such; not as related to nature and the human constitution, but as making a sort of Third Estate with the world and the soul. Hence, the restorers of readings, the emendators, the bibliomaniacs of all degrees.","The hearing ear is always found close to the speaking tongue; and no genius can long or often utter anything which is not invited and gladly entertained by men around him.","Ever the words of the gods resound; But the porches of man\'s ear seldom in this low life\'s round are unsealed, that he may hear.","Look sharply after your own thoughts. They come unlooked for, like a new bird seen on your trees, and, if you turn to your usual task, disappear; and you shall never find that perception again; never, I say-but perhaps years, ages, and I know not what events and worlds my lie between you and its return.","The longest wave is quickly lost in the sea.","There is something servile in the habit of seeking after a law which we must obey.","The laws of each are convertible into the laws of any other.","Law rules throughout existence, a Law which is not intelligent, but Intelligence.","The highest virtue is always against the law.","We do not yet trust the unknown powers of thought. Whence came all these tools, inventions, book laws, parties, kingdoms? Out of the invisible world, through a few brains. The arts and institutions of men are created out of thought. The powers that make the capitalist are metaphysical, the force of method and force of will makes trade, and builds towns.","But I cannot recite, even thus rudely, laws of the intellect, without remembering that lofty and sequestered class of men who have been its prophets and oracles, the high-priesthood of the pure reason, the Trismegisti, the expounders of the principles of thought from age to age.","Wherever we go, whatever we do, self is the sole subject we study and learn.","Men grind and grind in the mill of a truism, and nothing comes out but what was put in. But the moment they desert the tradition for a spontaneous thought, then poetry, wit, hope, virtue, learning, anecdote, and all flock to their aid.","I hear therefore with joy whatever is beginning to be said of the dignity and necessity of labor to every citizen. There is virtue yet in the hoe and the spade, for learned as well as for unlearned hands. And labor is everywhere welcome; always we are invited to work; only be this limitation observed, that a man shall not for the sake of wider activity sacrifice any opinion to the popular judgments and modes of action.","A certain awkwardness marks the use of borrowed thoughts; but as soon as we have learned what to do with them, they become our own.","There is a good ear, in some men, that draws supplies to virtue out of very indifferent nutriment.","If you act, you show character; if you sit still, you show it; if you sleep you show it.","We are all wise for other people, none for himself.","To laugh often and much ... this is to have succeeded.  Probably not from Emerson: here\'s the full quotation and the story.","Conservatism makes no poetry, breathes no prayer, has no invention; it is all memory. Reform has no gratitude, no prudence, no husbandry.","If it costs ten years, and ten to recover the general prosperity, the destruction of the South is worth so much.","Shall we then judge a country by the majority, or by the minority? By the minority, surely. \'Tis pedantry to estimate nations by the census, or by square miles of land, or other than by their importance to the mind of the time.","Are you not scared by seeing that the gypsies are more attractive to us than the apostles?","When I have attempted to join myself to others by services, it proved an intellectual trick,-no more. They eat your service like apples, and leave you out. But love them, and they feel you, and delight in you all the time.","Plants are the young of the world, vessels of health and vigor; but they grope ever upward towards consciousness; the trees are imperfect men, and seem to bemoan their imprisonment,  rooted in the ground.","The only reward of virtue is virtue.","Do not spill thy soul in running hither and yon, grieving over the mistakes and the vices of others. The one person whom it is most necessary to reform is yourself.","When the Master of the universe has points to carry in his government he impresses his will in the structure of minds.","A man cannot speak but he judges himself","It is very unhappy, but too late to be helped, the discovery we have made, that we exist","Prosperity is something the businessmen created for politicians to take credit for","A fly is as untamable as a hyena.","All the thoughts of a turtle are turtle","Nature and literature are subjective phenomena; every evil and every good thing is a shadow which we cast","Whoever fights, whoever falls, Justice conquers evermore","The judge weighs the arguments and puts a brave face on the matter, and since there must be a decision, decides as he can, and hopes he has done justice and given satisfaction to the community","How painful to give a gift to any person of sensibility, or of equality! It is next worst to receiving one","The best part of health is fine disposition","Words are finite expressions of the infinite mind.","I can believe a miracle because I can raise my own arm. I can believe a miracle because I can remember. I can believe it because I can speak and be understood by you.","Our expense is almost all for conformity. It is for cake that we run in debt; \'tis not the intellect, not the heart, not beauty, not worship, that costs so much.","\'Tis a superstition to insist on a special diet. All is made at last of the same chemical atoms.","Every really able man, in whatever direction he works - a man of large affairs, an inventor, a statesman, an orator, a poet, a painter - if you talk sincerely with him, considers his work, however much admired, as far short of what it should be. What is this Better, this flying Ideal, but the perpetual promise of his Creator?","...What torments of pain have you endured that haven\'t as yet arrived? and may never!","Every man\'s task [his \'great dream\' and impassioned life-goal] is his life preserver.","The April winds are magical, And thrill our tuneful frames; The garden-walks are passional To bachelors and dames.","The pest of society are the egotist, they are dull and bright, sacred and profane, course and fine. It is a disease that like the flu falls on all constitutions.","The interminable forests should become graceful parks, for use and delight.","Women have a less accurate measure of time than men; there is a clock in Adam, none in Eve.","What is a weed? A plant whose virtues have not yet been discovered.[What is a sorrow? A feeling whose benefits have not yet been discovered]","[Gratitude is] the cheerfulness of wisdom.","Nothing can bring you happiness but yourself especially how you choose to think about your situation.","To different minds, the same world is a hell, and a heaven depending on whether they compare it to something better and so feel disappointed and bitter or something worse and so feel relieved and grateful.","He is a dull observer whose experience has not taught him the reality and force of magic, as well as of chemistry.","But every jet of chaos which threatens to exterminate us is convertible by intellect into wholesome force. Fate is unpenetrated causes.","Look out! Behind you!","The pleasure of life is according to the man that lives it, and not according to the work or place.","Do your work, but do your thing.","At times the whole world seems to be in conspiracy to importune you with emphatic trifles.","We write from aspiration and antagonism, as well as from experience. We paint those qualities which we do not posses.","Every action has an ancestor of a thought.","You need someone who can inspire you to be what you know you can be","I wiped away the weeds and foam, I fetched my sea-borne treasures home.","Do your thing, and I shall know you.","Do not be caught by the sensational in nature, as a coarse red-faced sunset, a garrulous waterfall, or a fifteen thousand foot mountain... avoid prettiness - the word looks much like pettiness - and there is but little difference between them.","The crime which bankrupts men and nations is that of turning aside from one\'s main purpose to serve a job here and there.","We animate what we can see, and we see only what we animate.","Writing should be the settlement of dew on the leaf.","In the order of nature, we cannot render benefits to those from whom we receive them, or only seldom. But the benefit we receive must be rendered again, line for line, deed for deed, cent for cent, to somebody. Beware of too much good staying in your hand. It will fast corrupt and worm worms. Pay it away quickly in some sort.","For beauty is God\'s handwriting...A nd, thank God for it as a cup of His blessing.","When the night is darkest, the stars come out.","Manners are the happy ways of doing things.","Rings and jewels are not gifts, but apologies for gifts. The only gift is a portion of thyself. Thou must bleed for me. Therefore the poet brings his poem; the shepherd, his lamb; the farmer, corn; the miner, a stone; the painter, his picture; the girl, a handkerchief of her own sewing.","A good intention but fixed and resolute - bent on high and holy ends, we shall find means to them on every side and at every moment; and even obstacles and opposition will but make us \\"like the fabled specter-ships,\\" which sail the fastest in the very teeth of the wind.","What you are shouts at me so loudly that I can\'t hear a word you say.","Go out of the house to see the moon, and\'t is mere tinsel; it will not please as when its light shines upon your necessary journey.","The perception of the comic is a tie of sympathy with other men, a pledge of sanity, and a protection from those perverse tendencies and gloomy insanities in which fine intellects sometimes lose themselves. A rogue alive to the ludicrous is still convertible. If that sense is lost, his fellow-men can do little for him.","Of all tools, an observatory is the most sublime. . . . What is so good in a college as an observatory? The sublime attaches to the door and to the first stair you ascent, that this is the road to the stars.","One of the benefits of a college education is to show the boy its little avail.","The colleges, while they provide us with libraries, furnish no professors of books; and I think no chair is so much needed.","If in the least particular, one could derange the order of nature, who would accept the gift of life?","Spartans, stoics, heroes, saints and gods use short and positive speech.","Who can . . . guess how much industry and providence and affection we have caught from the pantomime of brutes?","Truth is too simple for us: we do not like those who unmask our illusions.","There are men whose manners have the same essential splendor as the simple and awful sculpture on the friezes of the Parthenon, and the remains of the earliest Greek art.","The simplicity of the universe is very different from the simplicity of a machine. The simplicity of nature is not that which may be easily read but is inexhaustible. The last analysis can no wise be made.","Converse with a mind that is grandly simple, and literature looks like word-catching.","Some men are born to own, and can animate all their possessions. Others cannot: their owning is not graceful; seems to be a compromise of their character: they seem to steal their own dividends.","The gentleman is a man of truth.","A day is a miniature eternity.","If we suddenly plant our foot, and say, - I will neither eat nor drink nor wear nor touch any food or fabric which I do not know to be innocent, or deal with any person whose whole manner of life is not clear and rational, we shall stand still. Whose is so? Not mine; not thine; not his. But I think we must clear ourselves each one by the interrogation, whether we have earned our bread to-day by the hearty contribution of our energies to the common benefit? and we must not cease to tend to the correction of these flagrant wrongs, by laying one stone aright every day.","Indeed the river is a perpetual gala, and boasts each month a new ornament.","Life is an ecstasy. Life is sweet as nitrous oxide.","The hard soil and four months of snow make the inhabitants of the northern temperate zone wiser and abler than his fellow who enjoys the fixed smile of the tropics.","Never try to make anyone like you: you know, and God knows, that one of you is enough.","I find the Englishman to be him of all men who stands firmest in his shoes. They have in themselves what they value in their horses, mettle and bottom.","One of our statesmen said, \\"The curse of this country is eloquent men.\\"","What school, college, or lecture bring men depends on what men bring to carry it home in.","The key to the age may be this, or that, or the other, as the young orators describe; the key to all ages is - Imbecility; imbecility in the vast majority of men, at all times, and, even in heroes, in all but certain eminent moments; victims of gravity","The arts and inventions of each period are only its costume, and do not invigorate men.","Out of Plato come all things that are still written and debated about among men of thought.","Men are lenses through which we read our own minds.","Men lose their tempers in defending their taste.","In America the geography is sublime, but the men are not; the inventions are excellent, but the inventors one is sometimes ashamed of.","Never utter the truism but live it among men.","I like man, but not men.","Men are better than this theology.","A man is like a bit of Labrador spar, which has no lustre as you turn it in your hand until you come to a particular angle; then it shows deep and beautiful colors. There is no adaptation or universal applicability in men, but each has his special Talent, and the mastery of Successful men consists in adroitly keeping themselves where and when that turn shall be oftenest to be practiced.","America is a country of young men.","There is a class of persons to whom by all spiritual affinity i am bought and sold; for them i will go to prison, if need be; but your miscellaneous popular charities; the education at college of fools; the building of meeting-houses to the vain end to which many now stand; alms to sots; and the thousandfold Relief Societies; - though i confess with shame i sometimes succumb and give the dollar, it is a wicked dollar which by and by i shall have the manhood to withhold.","A man must consider what a blindman\'s-buff is this game of conformity.","The voyage of the best ship is a zigzag line of a hundred tacks. See the line from a sufficient distance, and it straightens itself to the average tendency. Your genuine action will explain itself, and will explain your other genuine actions. Your conformity explains nothing. Act singly, and what you have already done singly will justify you now. Greatness appeals to the future.","Whence, then, this worship of the past? The centuries are conspirators against the sanity and authority of the soul.","He cannot be happy and strong until he too lives with nature in the present, above time.","Nature suffers nothing to remain in her kingdom which cannot help itself.","Let a stoic open the resources of man, and tell men they are not leaning willows, but can and must detach themselves; that with the exercise of self-trust, new powers shall appear.","Our age is retrospective. It builds the sepulchres of the fathers. It writes biographies, histories and criticism.","Greek architecture is the flowering of geometry.","Deal in our privacy with the last honesty and truth.","What is the foundation of that interest all men feel in Greek history, letters, art, and poetry, in all its periods, from the Heroic or Homeric age down to the domestic life of the Athenians and Spartans, four or five centuries later? What but this, that every man passes personally through a Grecian period.","We sometimes meet an original gentleman, who, if manners had not existed, would have invented them.","The intellect searches out the Absolute order of things as they stand in the mind of God, and without the colors of affection. The intellectual and the active powers seem to succeed each other, and the exclusive activity of the one generates the exclusive activity of the other. There is something unfriendly in each to the other, but they are like the alternate periods of feeding and working in animals; each prepares and will be followed by the other.","Quotation confesses inferiority.","Why has my motley diary no jokes? Because it is a soliloquy and every man is grave alone.","Five great enemies of peace inhabit us: avarice, ambition, envy, anger and pride.","It is God in you that responds to God without, or affirms his own words trembling on the lips of another.","Solitude is naught and society is naught. Alternate them and the good of each is seen.","Genius is power, talent is applicability.","Conversation is the laboratory and workshop of the student.","All the devils respect virtue.","Enlarge not thy destiny, said the oracle: endeavor not to do more than is given thee in charge.","Great men exist that there might be greater men.","We find in life exactly what we put into it","The religions we call false were once true.","The religions are obsolete when the reforms do not proceed from them.","Heaven sometimes hedges a rare character about with ungainliness and odium, as the burr that protects the fruit.","To live the greatest number of good hours is wisdom.","The world is all outside, it has no inside.","The course of everything goes to teach us faith.","Our faith comes in moments . . . yet there is a depth in those brief moments which constrains us to ascribe more reality to them than to all other experiences.","Little thinks, in the field, yon red-cloaked clown, Of thee, from the hill-top looking down; And the heifer, that lows in the upland farm, Far-heard, lows not thine ear to charm; The sexton tolling the bell at noon, Dreams not that great Napoleon Sto","Who are the farmer\'s servants? ... Geology and Chemistry, the quarry of the air, the water of the brook, the lightning of the cloud, the castings of the worm, the plough of the frost.","In America and Europe, the nomadism is of trade and curiosity.","A man is a hero, not because he is braver than anyone else, but because he is brave for 10 minutes longer.","A good intention clothes itself with sudden power. When a god wishes to ride, any chip or pebble will bud and shoot out winged feet, and serve him for a horse.","The influence of the senses have in men overpowered the thought to the degree that the walls of time and space have come to look solid, real and insurmountable. .. Yet time and space are but inverse measures of the power of the mind. Man is capable of abolishing them both.","Every man is a channel through which heaven floweth.","Men of character are the conscience of the society to which they belong.","When I bought my farm, I did not know what a bargain I had in the bluebirds, daffodils and thrushes; as little did I know what sublime mornings and sunsets I was buying.","Man\'s actions are the picture book of his creeds.","Add energy, inspire hope, and blow the coals into a useful flame.","The whole of what we know is a system of compensation. Every defect in one manner is made up in another. Every suffering is rewarded; every sacrifice is made up; every debt is paid.","The eye is the first circle; the horizon which it forms is the second; and throughout nature this primary figure is repeated without end.","Cities give us collision. \'Tis said, London and New York take the nonsense out of a man.","Whatever you do, you need courage.","Society has no bribe for me.","Guard your own spare moments. They are like uncut diamonds.","The height of the pinnacle is determined by the breadth of the base.","Meek young men grow up in libraries.","No orator can top the one who can give good nicknames.","A good symbol is the best argument, and is a missionary to persuade thousands.","Great works of art have no more affecting lesson for us than this. They teach us to abide by our own spontaneous expression with good humored inflexibility whether the whole cry of voices is on the other side.","He is a good man who can receive a gift well.","My good hoe as it bites the ground revenges my wrongs, and I have less lust to bite my enemies. In the smoothing the rough hillocks, I smooth my temper.","Our moods do not believe in each other.  To-day I am full of thoughts, and can write what I please.  I see no reason why I should not have the same thought, the same power of expression, to-morrow.  What I write, whilst I write it, seems the most natural thing in the world; but yesterday I saw a dreary vacuity in this direction in which now I see so much; and a month hence, I doubt not, I shall wonder who he was that wrote so many continuous pages.  Alas for this infirm faith, this will not strenuous, this vast ebb of a vast flow!  I am God in nature; I am a weed by the wall.","Throb thine with Nature\'s throbbing breast.","Nature tells every secret once.","There are eyes, to be sure, that give no more admission into the man than blueberries.","Here is the world, sound as a nut, perfect, not the smallest piece of chaos left, never a stitch nor an end, not a mark of haste, or botching, or second thought; but the theory of the world is a thing of shreds and patches.","The world always had the same bankrupt look, to foregoing ages as to us.","The world is full of judgment-days, and into every assembly that a man enters, in every action he attempts, he is gauged and stamped.","The world is his who can see through its pretension.","Tart, cathartic virtue.","The virtue in most request is conformity.","It was a pleasure and a privilege to walk with him [H.D. Thoreau].  He knew the country like a fox or a bird, and passed through it as freely by paths of his own.","For the world was built in order around the atoms march in tune; Rhyme the pipe, and Time the warder, The sun obeys them, and the moon.","Consider what you have in the smallest chosen library.  A company of the wisest and wittiest men that could be picked out of all civil countries, in a thousand years, have set in best order the results of their learning and wisdom.","If the red slayer think he slays, Or if the slain think he is slain, They know not well the subtle ways, I keep and pass and turn again.","We seldom see anybody who is not uneasy or afraid to live.","Who shall forbid a wise skepticism, seeing that there is no practical question on which anything more than an approximate solution can be had?","Why should we be cowed by the name of Action?.","The German intellect wants the French sprightliness, the fine practical understanding of the English, and the American adventure; but it has a certain probity, which never rests in a superficial performance, but asks steadily, To what end? A German public asks for a controlling sincerity.","Let us, if we must have great actions, make our own so. All action is of infinite elasticity, and the least admits of being inflated with celestial air, until it eclipses the sun and moon.","I honor health as the first Muse.","The highest Beauty should be plain set.","Come, see the north-wind\'s masonry, Out of an unseen quarry evermore Furnished with tile, the fierce artificer Curves his white bastions with projected roof Round every windward stake, or tree, or door. Speeding, the myriad-handed, his wild work So fanciful, so savage, naught cares he For number or proportion.","We are made aware that magnitude of material things is relative, and all objects shrink and expand to serve the passion of the poet. Thus, in his sonnets, the lays of birds, the scents and dyes of flowers, he finds to be the shadow of his beloved; time, which keeps her from him, is his chest; the suspicion she has awakened, is her ornament","Sometimes we receive the power to say yes to life. Then peace enters us and makes us whole.","Truth is always present; it only needs to lift the iron lids of the mind\'s eye to read its oracles.","Talents differ; all is well and wisely put; If I cannot carry forests on my back, Neither can you crack a nut.","Headwinds are sore vexations and the more passengers the sorer.","It is time to be old\\nTo take in sail.","Everyone I meet is in some way my superior.","There is no den in the wide world to hide a rogue. Commit a crime, and the earth is made of glass. Commit a crime, and it seems as if a coat of snow fell on the ground, such as reveals in the woods the track of every partridge and fox and squirrel and mole.","Beauty is the mark God sets upon virtue.","Classics which at home are drowsily read have a strange charm in a country inn, or in the transom of a merchant brig.","I wish to write such rhymes as shall not suggest a restraint, but contrariwise the wildest freedom.","Of course, he who has put forth his total strength in fit actions, has the richest return of wisdom.","In this distribution of functions, the scholar is the delegated intellect. In the right state, he is, Man Thinking. In the degenerate state, when the victim of society, he tends to become a mere thinker, or, still worse, the parrot of other men\'s thinking.","Though we travel the world over to find the beautiful, we must carry it with us, or we find it not. The best of beauty is a finer charm than skill in surfaces, in outlines, or rules of art can ever teach, namely, a radiation from the work of art of human character, \u2014 a wonderful expression through stone, or canvas, or musical sound, of the deepest and simplest attributes of our nature, and therefore most intelligible at last to those souls which have these attributes.","There will be an agreement in whatever variety of actions, so they be each honest and natural in their hour. For of one will, the actions will be harmonious, however unlike they seem. These varieties are lost sight of at a little distance, at a little height of thought. One tendency unites them all. The voyage of the best ship is a zigzag line of a hundred tacks. See the line from a sufficient distance, and it straightens itself to the average tendency.","The Indian who was laid under a curse, that the wind should not blow on him, nor water flow to him, nor fire burn him, is a type of us all. The dearest events are summer-rain, and we the Para coats that shed every drop. Nothing is left us now but death. We look to that with a grim satisfaction, saying, there at least is reality that will not dodge us.","All our progress is an unfolding, like the vegetable bud. You have first an instinct, then an opinion, then a knowledge, as the plant has root, bud, and fruit. Trust the instinct to the end, though you can render no reason. It is vain to hurry it. By trusting it to the end it shall ripen into truth, and you shall know why you believe.","The young men were born with knives in their brain, a tendency to introversion, self-dissection, anatomizing of motives.","I give you joy of your free and brave thought. I have great joy in it. I find incomparable things said incomparably well, as they must be. I find the courage of treatment which so delights us, and which large perception only can inspire.","The borrowing is often honest enough, and comes of magnanimity and stoutness. A great man quotes bravely and will not draw on his invention when his memory serves him with a word as good.","Most of the classical citations you shall hear or read in the current journals or speeches were not drawn from the originals, but from previous quotations in English books.","Many of the historical proverbs have a doubtful paternity.","Whatever we think and say is wonderfully better for our spirits and trust in another mouth.","We may like well to know what is Plato\u2019s and what is Montesquieu\u2019s or Goethe\u2019s part, and what thought was always dear to the writer himself; but the worth of the sentences consists in their radiancy and equal aptitude to all intelligence. They fit all our facts like a charm. We respect ourselves the more that we know them.","When a man thinks happily, he finds no foot-track in the field he traverses. All spontaneous thought is irrespective of all else.","The divine gift is ever the instant life, which receives and uses and creates, and can well bury the old in the omnipotency with which Nature decomposes all her harvest for recomposition.","All minds quote. Old and new make the warp and woof of every moment. There is no thread that is not a twist of these two strands. By necessity, by proclivity, and by delight, we all quote. We quote not only books and proverbs, but arts, sciences, religion, customs, and laws; nay, we quote temples and houses, tables and chairs, by imitation.","Good as is discourse, silence is better and shames it.","Look out into the July night, and see the broad belt of silver flame which flashes up the half of heaven, fresh and delicate as the bonfires of the meadow-flies. Yet the powers of numbers cannot compute its enormous age,\u2014lasting as space and time,\u2014embosomed in time and space.","Life is in short cycles or periods; we are quickly tired, but we have rapid rallies. A man is spent by his work, starved, prostrate; he will not lift his hand to save his life; he can never think more. He sinks into deep sleep and wakes with renewed youth, with hope, courage, fertile in resources, and keen for daring adventure.","We must not tamper with the organic motion of the soul.","[D]ivine Providence... keeps the universe open in every direction to the soul.","Let us not look east and west for materials of conversation, but rest in presence and unity. A just feeling will fast enough supply fuel for discourse, if speaking be more grateful than silence. When people come to see us, we foolishly prattle, lest we be inhospitable. But things said for conversation are chalk eggs. Don\'t say things. What you are stands over you the while, and thunders so that I cannot hear what you say to the contrary.","One more fagot of these adamantine bandages is the new science of Statistics.","I cannot forgive a scholar his homeless despondency.","The sea, washing the equator and the poles, offers its perilous aid, and the power and empire that follow it... \'\'Beware of me,\'\' it says, \'\'but if you can hold me, I am the key to all the lands.","As many languages as he has, as many friends, as many arts and trades, so many times is he a man.","The brevity of human life gives a melancholy to the profession of the architect.","Tis the privilege of Art Thus to play its cheerful part, Man on earth to acclimate And bend the exile to his fate.","How casually and unobservedly we make all our most valued acquaintances.","Each man reserves to himself alone the right of being tedious.","Black men built the railroads, not blue eyes.","People who wash much have a high mind about it, and talk down to those who wash little.","The men who come on the stage at one period are all found to be related to each other. Certain ideas are in the air.","Private, accidental, confidential conversation breeds thought. Clubs produce oftener words.","The art of conversation, or the qualification for a good companion, is a certain self-control, which now holds the subject, now lets it go, with a respect for the emergencies of the moment.","Character is higher than intellect. Thinking is the function; living is the functionary.","No man gains credit for his cowardly courtesies.","Nature is a rag merchant, who works up every shred and ort and end into new creations.","By the irresistible maturing of the general mind, the Christian traditions have lost their hold.","Every stoic was a stoic; but in Christendom where is the Christian?","Instead of making Christianity a vehicle of truth, you make truth only a horse for Christianity.","It is curious that Christianity, which is idealism, is sturdily defended by the brokers, and steadily attacked by the idealists.","How beautiful to have the church always open, so that every tired wayfaring man may come in and be soothed by all that art can suggest of a better world when he is weary with this.","The idea of God ends in a paltry Methodist meeting-house.","No man can be criticised but by a greater than he. Do not, then, read the reviews.","The finest people marry the two sexes in their own person.","The quality of the thought differences the Egyptian and the Roman, the Austrian and the American.","The finest poems of the world have been expedients to get bread.","Within, I do not find wrinkles and used heart, but unspent youth.","We cannot forgive another for not being ourselves.","The peace of the man who has forsworn the use of the bullet seems to me not quite peace, but a canting impotence.","A painter told me that nobody could draw a tree without in some sort becoming a tree.","The picture waits for my verdict; it is not to command me, but I am to settle its claim to praise.","A poem is made up of thoughts, each of which filled the whole sky of the poet in its turn.","Poetry makes its own pertinence, and a single stanza outweighs a book of prose.","When a man does not write his poetry, it escapes by other vents through him.","We are not free to use today, or to promise tomorrow, because we are already mortgaged to yesterday.","Always pay; for first or last you must pay your entire debt.","No man has a right perception of any truth, who has not been reacted on by it, so as to be ready to be its martyr.","You need not fear to handle the truth roughly. She is no invalid.","If a man fasten his attention on a single aspect of truth and apply himself to that alone for a long time, the truth becomes distorted and not itself but falsehood.","The most tedious of all discourses are on the subject of the Supreme Being.","Invention breeds invention. No sooner is the electric telegraph devised than gutta-percha, the very material it requires, is found. The aeronaut is provided with gun-cotton, the very fuel he wants for his balloon.","[W]e pity our fathers for dying before steam and galvanism, sulphuric ether and ocean telegraphs, photograph and spectrograph arrived, as cheated out of their human estate.","Life is girt all round with a zodiac of sciences, the contributions of men who have perished to add their point of light to our sky. ... These road-makers on every hand enrich us. We must extend the area of life and multiply our relations. We are as much gainers by finding a property in the old earth as by acquiring a new planet.","We do what we must, and call it by the best names we can, and would fain have the praise of having intended the result which ensues.","A bullet had found him, his blood ran out as he cried. No money could save him, so he laid down and died. Ooh, what a lucky man he was.","The mind will quote whether the tongue does or not.","Performing on a stool, we\'ve got a sight to make you drool, seven virgins and a mule, keep it cool, keep it cool.","Every day, a little sadder, a little madder. Will someone get me a ladder?","Steam is no stronger now than it was a hundred years ago, but it is put to better use.","All the tools and engines on earth are only extensions of man\'s limbs and senses.","Earth proudly wears the Parthenon As the best gem upon her zone.","Earth laughs in flowers to see her boastful boys Earth-proud, proud of the earth which is not theirs; Who steer the plough, but cannot steer their feet Clear of the grave.","The affirmative of affirmatives... is love.","After you have pumped your brains for thoughts and verses, there is a better poetry hinted in whistling a tune on your walk.","It is the ignorant and childish part of mankind that is the fighting part. Idle and vacant minds want excitement","Men who know the same things are not long the best company for each other.","A nation never falls but by suicide.","The universal does not attract us until housed in an individual.","Eloquence shows the power and possibility of man.","In eloquence, the great triumphs of the art are when the orator is lifted above himself; when consciously he makes himself the mere tongue of the occasion and the hour, and says what cannot but be said. Hence the term \\"abandonment\\" to describe the self- surrender of the orator. Not his will, but the principle on which he is horsed, the great connection and crisis of events, thunder in the ear of the crowd.","The pleasure of eloquence is in greatest part owing often to the stimulus of the occasion which produces it- - to the magic of sympathy, which exalts the feeling of each by radiating on him the feeling of all.","Our books approach very slowly the things we most wish to know.","Of lower states, of acts of routine and sense, we can tell somewhat; but the masterpieces of God, the total growths and universalmovements of the soul, he hideth; they are incalculable. I can know that truth is divine and helpful; but how it shall help me I can have no guess, for so to be is the sole inlet of so to know.","All I know is reception; I am and I have: but I do not get, and when I fancied I had gotten anything, I found I did not.","The intellectual life may be kept clean and healthful, if man will live the life of nature, and not import into his mind difficulties which are none of his.","The scholar is that man who must take up into himself all the ability of the time, all the contributions of the past, all the hopes of the future. He must be an university of knowledges.","Inaction is cowardice, but there can be no scholar without the heroic mind.","The learned and the studious of thought have no monopoly of wisdom. Their violence of direction in some degree disqualifies them to think truly.","Among the multitude of scholars and authors, we feel no hallowing presence; we are sensible of a knack and skill rather than of inspiration; they have a light, and know not whence it comes, and call it their own; their talent is some exaggerated faculty, some overgrown member, so that their strength is a disease.","The motive of science was the extension of man, on all sides, into Nature, till his hands should touch the stars, his eyes see through the earth, his ears understand the language of beast and bird, and the sense of the wind; and, through his sympathy, heaven and earth should talk with him. But that is not our science.","Science in England, in America, is jealous of theory, hates the name of love and moral purpose. There\'s revenge for this humanity.What manner of man does science make? The boy is not attracted. He says, I do not wish to be such a kind of man as my professor is.","People seem sheathed in their tough organization.","It is the last lesson of modern science, that the highest simplicity of structure is produced, not by few elements, but by the highest complexity.","Nor has science sufficient humanity, so long as the naturalist overlooks the wonderful congruity which subsists between man and the world; of which he is lord, not because he is the most subtile inhabitant, but because he is its head and heart, and finds something of himself in every great and small thing, in every mountain stratum, in every new law of color, fact of astronomy, or atmospheric influence which observation or analysis lay open.","The axioms of physics translate the laws of ethics. Thus, \\"the whole is greater than its part;\\" \\"reaction is equal to action;\\" \\"the smallest weight may be made to lift the greatest, the difference of weight being compensated by time;\\" and many the like propositions, which have an ethical as well as physical sense. These propositions have a much more extensive and universal sense when applied to human life, than when confined to technical use.","Empirical science is apt to cloud the sight, and, by the very knowledge of functions and processes, to bereave the student of themanly contemplation of the whole.","The modernness of all good books seems to give men an existence as wide as man.","The customer is the immediate jewel of our souls. Him we flatter, him we feast, compliment, vote for, and will not contradict.","For you, o broker, there is no other principle but arithmetic. For me, commerce is of trivial import; love, faith, truth of character, the aspiration of man, these are sacred; nor can I detach one duty, like you, from all other duties, and concentrate my forces mechanically on the payment of moneys.","This whole business of Trade gives me to pause and think, as it constitutes false relations between men; inasmuch as I am prone tocount myself relieved of any responsibility to behave well and nobly to that person who I pay with money, whereas if I had not that commodity, I should be put on my good behavior in all companies, and man would be a benefactor to man, as being himself his only certificate that he had a right to those aids and services which each asked of the other.","Of the Shaker society, it was formerly a sort of proverb in the country, that they always sent the devil to market.","I look on trade and every mechanical craft as education also. But let me discriminate what is precious herein. There is in each ofthese works an act of invention, an intellectual step, or short series of steps taken; that act or step is the spiritual act; all the rest is mere repetition of the same a thousand times.","The paid wealth which hundreds in the community acquire in trade, or by the incessant expansions of our population and arts, enchants the eyes of all the rest; the luck of one is the hope of thousands, and the bribe acts like the neighborhood of a gold mine to impoverish the farm, the school, the church, the house, and the very body and feature of man.","The best political economy is the care and culture of men; for, in these crises, all are ruined except such as are proper individuals, capable of thought, and of new choice and the application of their talent to new labor.","A man should not be a silkworm; nor a nation a tent of caterpillars.","Then climate is a great impediment to idle persons; we often resolve to give up the care of the weather, but still we regard the clouds and the rain.","The Frenchman invented the ruffle; the Englishman added the shirt.","Our civility, England determines the style of, inasmuch as England is the strongest of the family of existing nations, and as we are the expansion of that people. It is that of a trading nation; it is a shopkeeping civility. The English lord is a retired shopkeeper, and has the prejudices and timidities of that profession.","There is no country in which so absolute a homage is paid to wealth. In America there is a touch of shame when a man exhibits theevidences of large property, as if after all it needed apology. But the Englishman has pure pride in his wealth, and esteems it a final certificate. A coarse logic rules throughout all English souls: if you have merit, can you not show it by your good clothes and coach and horses?","A seashell should be the crest of England, not only because it represents a power built on the waves, but also the hard finish ofthe men. The Englishman is finished like a cowry or a murex.","A Frenchman may possibly be clean; an Englishman is conscientiously clean.","What opium is instilled into all disaster? It shows formidable as we approach it, but there is at last no rough rasping friction,but the most slippery sliding surfaces. We fall soft on a thought.","No man ever came to an experience which was satiating, but his good is tidings of a better. Onward and onward!","Good as is discourse, silence is better, and shames it. The length of the discourse indicates the distance of thought betwixt the speaker and the hearer. If they were at a perfect understanding in any part, no words would be necessary thereon. If at one in all parts, no words would be suffered.","We are sure that, though we know not how, necessity does comport with liberty, the individual with the world, my polarity with thespirit of the times. The riddle of the age has for each a private solution.","Because the soul is progressive, it never quite repeats itself, but in every act attempts the production of a new and fairer whole.","But it is impossible that the creative power should exclude itself. Into every intelligence there is a door which is never closed,through which the creator passes.","The world is young: the former great men call to us affectionately. We too must write Bibles, to unite again the heavens and the earthly world.","Speak as you think, be what you are, pay your debts of all kinds. I prefer to be owned as sound and solvent, and my word as good as my bond, and to be what cannot be skipped, or dissipated, or undermined, to all the eclat in the universe. This reality is the foundation of friendship, religion, poetry, and art.","We must learn the language of facts. The most wonderful inspirations die with their subject, if he has no hand to paint them to the senses.","It is easy to see that what is best written or done by genius in the world, was no man\'s work but came by wide social labor, whena thousand wrought like one, sharing the same impulse.","So each man, like each plant, has his parasites. A strong, astringent, bilious nature has more truculent enemies than the slugs and moths that fret my leaves. Such a one has curculios, borers, knife-worms; a swindler ate him first, then a client, then a quack, then smooth, plausible gentlemen, bitter and selfish as Moloch.","The magnanimous know very well that they who give time, or money, or shelter, to the stranger--so it be done for love, and not forostentation--do, as it were, put God under obligation to them, so perfect are the compensations of the universe.","The persons who constitute the natural aristocracy, are not found in the actual aristocracy, or, only on its edge; as the chemicalenergy of the spectrum is found to be greatest just outside of the spectrum.","Society gains nothing whilst a man, not himself renovated, attempts to renovate things around him; he has become tediously good insome particular but negligent or narrow in the rest; and hypocrisy and vanity are often the disgusting result.","Every man\'s nature is a sufficient advertisement to him of the character of his fellows.","In our Mechanics\' Fair, there must be not only bridges, ploughs, carpenter\'s planes, and baking troughs, but also some few finer instruments,--rain-gauges, thermometers, and telescopes; and in society, besides farmers, sailors, and weavers, there must be a few persons of purer fire kept specially as gauges and meters of character; persons of a fine, detecting instinct, who note the smallest accumulations of wit and feeling in the bystander.","Our life seems not present, so much as prospective; not for the affairs on which it is wasted, but as a hint of this vast- flowingvigor.","The history of the genesis or the old mythology repeats itself in the experience of every child. He too is a demon or god thrown into a particular chaos, where he strives ever to lead things from disorder into order.","A breath of will blows eternally through the universe of souls in the direction of Right and Necessity. It is the air which all intellects inhale and exhale, and it is the wind which blows the worlds into order and orbit.","Necessity does everything well. In our condition of universal dependence, it seems heroic to let the petitioner be the judge of his necessity, and to give all that is asked, though at great inconvenience.","Taking to pieces is the trade of those who cannot construct.","Cities degrade us by magnifying trifles.","What is the city in which we sit here, but an aggregate of incongruous materials, which have obeyed the will of some man?","Away with this hurrah of masses, and let us have the considerate vote of single men.","The great majority of men grow up and grow old in seeming and following.","A cheerful, intelligent face is the end of culture.","What is civilization? I answer, the power of good women.","There is nothing we value and hunt and cultivate and strive to draw to us, but in some hour we turn and rend it.","My own mind is the direct revelation which I have from God and far least liable to mistake in telling his will of any revelation.","Ah, if the rich were rich as the poor fancy riches.","Our statute is a currency which we stamp with our own portrait.","Love is the bright foreigner, the foreign self.","No love can be bound by oath or covenant to secure it against a higher love.","The lover is made happier by his love than the object of his affection.","The best university that can be recommended to a man of ideas is the gauntlet of the mob.","One of the illusions of life is that the present hour is not the critical decisive hour. Write it on your heart that every day is the best day of the year. He only is right who owns the day, and no one owns the day who allows it to be invaded by worry, fret and anxiety. Finish every day, and be done with it. You have done what you could.","You may regret calamities if you can thereby help the sufferer, but if you cannot, mind your own business.","Looking at God instantly reduces our disposition to dissent from our brother.","The world is always childish, and with each new gewgaw of a revolution or new constitution that it finds, thinks it shall never cry any more.","A forte always makes a foible.","You can take better care of your secret than another can.","We resent all criticism which denies us anything that lies in our line of advance.","There are men whose language is strong and defying enough, yet their eyes and their actions ask leave of other men to live.","It is sublime to think and say of another, I need never meet, or speak, or write to him: we need not reinforce ourselves, or send tokens of remembrance; I rely on him as on myself: if he did thus and thus, I know it was right.","The essence of friendship is entireness, a total magnanimity and trust.","I do not wonder at a snowflake, a shell, a summer landscape, or the glory of the stars; but at the necessity of beauty under which the universe lies.","The universe does not jest with us, but is in earnest.","The order of things consents to virtue.","In sculpture did ever anybody call the Apollo a fancy piece? Or say of the Laocoon how it might be made different? A masterpiece of art has in the mind a fixed place in the chain of being, as much as a plant or a crystal.","Announced by all the trumpets of the sky,\\nArrives the snow, and, driving o\'er the fields,\\nSeems nowhere to alight: the whited air\\nHides hills and woods, the river, and the heaven,\\nAnd veils the farmhouse at the garden\'s end.\\nThe sled and traveller stopped, the courier\'s feet\\nDelayed, all friends shut out, the housemates sit\\nAround the radiant fireplace, enclosed In a tumultuous privacy of storm.","Travel is a fools paradise.","Words are finite organs of the infinite mind. They cannot cover the dimensions of what is in truth. They break, chop, and impoverish it.","I\'m happier.  I guess I made up my mind to be that way.","Why should I hasten to solve every riddle which life offers me? I am well assured that the Questioner, who brings me so many problems, will bring me the answers also, in due time.","Every person has his or her own vocation-talent is the call.","So use all that is called Fortune. Most men gamble with her, and gain all, and lose all, as her wheel rolls. But do thou leave as unlawful these winnings, and deal with Cause and Effect, the Chancellors of God.","Let us make education brave and preventive. Politics is an afterwork, a poor patching. We are always a little late... We shall one day learn to supercede politics by education... We must begin higher up, namely in Education.","Poetry being ... when we look from the center outward.","Every book is good to read which sets the reader in a working mood.","For every minute you are angry you lose sixty seconds of happiness.","Finish each day and be done with it. You have done what you could. Some blunders and absurdities no doubt crept in; forget them as soon as you can. Tomorrow is a new day. You shall begin it serenely and with too high a spirit to be encumbered with your old nonsense.","Do not go where the path may lead, go instead where there is no path and leave a trail.","What you do speaks so loudly that I cannot hear what you say.","When it is dark enough, you can see the stars.","All I have seen teaches me to trust the Creator for all I have not seen.","The earth laughs in flowers.","It is not the length of life, but the depth.","Life is a journey, not a destination.","Make the most of yourself....for that is all there is of you.","Write it on your heartthat every day is the best day in the year.He is rich who owns the day, and no one owns the daywho allows it to be invaded with fret and anxiety.

This new day is too dear,with its hopes and invitations,to waste a moment on the yesterdays.","Be not the slave of your own past - plunge into the sublime seas, dive deep, and swim far, so you shall come back with new self-respect, with new power, and with an advanced experience that shall explain and overlook the old.","Though we travel the world over to find the beautiful, we must carry it with us, or we find it not.","Don\'t be too timid and squeamish about your actions. All life is an experiment. The more experiments you make the better.","Shallow men believe in luck or in circumstance. Strong men believe in cause and effect.","People do not seem to realise that their opinion of the world is also a confession of their character.","The creation of a thousand forests is in one acorn","A foolish consistency is the hobgoblin of little minds, adored by little statesmen and philosophers and divines. With consistency a great soul has simply nothing to do. He may as well concern himself with his shadow on the wall. Speak what you think now in hard words, and to-morrow speak what to-morrow thinks in hard words again, though it contradict every thing you said to-day. \u2014 \'Ah, so you shall be sure to be misunderstood.\' \u2014 Is it so bad, then, to be misunderstood? Pythagoras was misunderstood, and Socrates, and Jesus, and Luther, and Copernicus, and Galileo, and Newton, and every pure and wise spirit that ever took flesh. To be great is to be misunderstood.","You become what you think about all day long.","When friendships are real, they are not glass threads or frost work, but the solidest things we can know.","In my walks, every man I meet is my superior in some way, and in that I learn from him.","Life is a succession of lessons which must be lived to be understood.","Nature and Books belong to the eyes that see them.","Let us be silent, that we may hear the whisper of God.","Do the thing you fear and the death of fear is certain.","I appeal from your customs. I must be myself. I cannot break myself any longer for you, or you. If you can love me for what I am, we shall be happier. If you cannot, I will still seek to deserve that you should. I must be myself. I will not hide my tastes or aversions. I will so trust that what is deep is holy, that I will do strongly before the sun and moon whatever inly rejoices me and the heart appoints. If you are noble, I will love you; if you are not, I will not hurt you and myself by hypocritical attentions. If you are true, but not in the same truth with me, cleave to your companions; I will seek my own. I do this not selfishly but humbly and truly. It is alike your interest, and mine, and all men\u2019s, however long we have dwelt in lies, to live in truth. Does this sound harsh to-day? You will soon love what is dictated by your nature as well as mine, and if we follow the truth it will bring us out safe at last.\u2014But so may you give these friends pain. Yes, but I cannot sell my liberty and my power, to save their sensibility. Besides, all persons have their moments of reason, when they look out into the region of absolute truth; then will they justify me and do the same thing.\\t  The populace think that your rejection of popular standards is a rejection of all standard, and mere antinomianism; and the bold sensualist will use the name of philosophy to gild his crimes. But the law of consciousness abides.","In a library we are surrounded by many hundreds of dear friends imprisoned by an enchanter in paper and leathern boxes.","What is success?To laugh often and much; to win the respect of intelligent people and the affection of children; to earn the appreciation of honest critics and endure the betrayal of false friends; to appreciate the beauty; to find the best in others; to leave the world a bit better, whether by a healthy child, a garden patch Or a redeemed social condition; to know even one life has breathed easier because you have lived. This is to have succeeded!","Life is short, but there is always time enough for courtesy.","A foolish consistency is the hobgoblin of little minds.","Nothing can bring you peace but yourself.","Of all the ways to lose a person, death is the kindest.","What I must do, is all that concerns me, not what the people think. This rule, equally arduous in actual and in intellectual life, may serve for the whole distinction between greatness and meanness. It is the harder, because you will always find those who think they know what is your duty better than you know it. It is easy in the world to live after the world\'s opinion; it is easy in solitude to live after our own; but the great man is he who in the midst of the crowd keeps with perfect sweetness the independence of solitude.","Fear always springsfrom ignorance.","What is a weed? A plant whose virtues have not yet been discovered.","Whatever course you decide upon there is always someone to tell you that you are wrong.

In the presence of nature, a wild delight runs through the man, in spite of real sorrows...","Man is timid and apologetic; he is no longer upright; he dares not say \\"I think,\\" \\"I am,\\" but quotes some saint or sage. He is ashamed before the blade of grass or the blowing rose. These roses under my window make no reference to former roses or to better ones; they are for what they are; they exist with God to-day. There is no time to them. There is simply the rose; it is perfect in every moment of its existence. Before a leaf-bud has burst, its whole life acts; in the full-blown flower there is no more; in the leafless root there is no less. Its nature is satisfied, and it satisfies nature, in all moments alike. But man postpones or remembers; he does not live in the present, but with reverted eye laments the past, or, heedless of the riches that surround him, stands on tiptoe to foresee the future. He cannot be happy and strong until he too lives with nature in the present, above time.","There is a time in every man\'s education when he arrives at the conviction that envy is ignorance; that imitation is suicide; that he must take himself for better for worse as his portion; that though the wide universe is full of good, no kernel of nourishing corn can come to him but through his toil bestowed on that plot of ground which is given to him to till. The power which resides in him is new in nature, and none but he knows what that is which he can do, nor does he know until he has tried. Not for nothing one face, one character, one fact makes much impression on him, and another none. This sculpture in the memory is not without pre\xe9stablishcd harmony. The eye was placed where one ray should fall, that it might testify of that particular ray. We but half express ourselves, and are ashamed of that divine idea which each of us represents. It may be safely trusted as proportionate and of good issues, so it be faithfully imparted, but God will not have his work made manifest by cowards. A man is relieved and gay when he has put his heart into his work and done his best; but what he has said or done otherwise shall give hint no peace. It is a deliverance which does not deliver. In the attempt his genius deserts him; no muse befriends; no invention, no hope.","Great men are they who see that spiritual is stronger than any material force, that thoughts rule the world.","Greatness is a property for which no man can receive credit too soon; it must be possessed long before it is acknowledged.","Never lose an opportunity for seeing something beautiful for beauty is God s handwriting.","Nature and books belong to all who see them.","As we grow old...the beauty steals inward.","People do not deserve good writing, they are so pleased with bad.","When you strike at a king, you must kill him.","Love what is simple and beautiful.

It loves not realities and creators, but names and customs.","The only true gift is a portion of thyself.","Belief consists in accepting the affirmations of the soul; unbelief, in denying them.","Give all to love;Obey thy heart....","Rings and jewels are not gifts, but apologies for gifts. The only gift is a portion of thyself. Thou must bleed for me.","No change in circumstances can repair a defect of character.","The voyage of the best ship is a zigzag line of a hundred tacks. See the line from a sufficient distance, and it straightens itself to the average tendency. Your genuine action will explain itself, and will explain your other genuine actions. Your conformity explains nothing. Act singly, and what you have already done singly will justify you now.","A man is relieved and gay when he has put his heart into his work and done his best.","The student is to read history actively not passively.","Faith and love are apt to be spasmodic in the best minds. Men live the brink of mysteries and harmonies into which they never enter, and with their hands on the door-latch they die outside.","To the attentive eye, each moment of the year has its own beauty, and in the same field, it beholds, every hour, a picture which was never seen before, and which shall never be seen again.","Your goodness must have some edge to it -- else it is none.","I appeal from your customs.

He who would gather immortal palms must not be hindered by the name of goodness, but must explore if it be goodness. Nothing is at last sacred but the integrity of our own mind. Absolve you to yourself, and you shall have the suffrage of the world. I remember an answer which when quite young I was prompted to make to a valued adviser who was wont to importune me with the dear old doctrines of the church. On my saying, What have I to do with the sacredness of traditions, if I live wholly from within? my friend suggested--\'But these impulses may be from below, not from above.\' I replied, \'They do not seem to me to be such; but if I am the devil\'s child, I will live them from the devil.\' No law can be sacred to me but that of my nature. Good and bad are but names very readily transferable to that or this; the only right is what is after my constitution, the only wrong what is against it.

I am ashamed to think how easily we capitulate to badges and names, to large societies and dead institutions. Every decent an well-spoken individual affects and sways me more than is right. I ought to go upright and vital, and speak the rude truth in all ways.","A person will worship something, have no doubt about that. We may think our tribute is paid in secret in the dark recesses of our hearts, but it will come out. That which dominates our imaginations and our thoughts will determine our lives, and our character. Therefore, it behooves us to be careful what we worship, for what we are worshipping, we are becoming.","Travelling is a fool\'s paradise. We owe to our first journeys the discovery that place is nothing. At home I dream that at Naples, at Rome, I can be intoxicated with beauty, and lose my sadness. I pack my trunk, embrace my friends, embark on the sea, and at last wake up in Naples, and there beside me is the stern Fact, the sad self, unrelenting identical that I fled from.","Misunderstood! It is a right fool\'s word. Is it so bad then to be misunderstood? Pythagoras was misunderstood, and Socrates, and Jesus, and Luther, and Copernicus, and Galileo, and Newton, and every pure and wise spirit that ever took flesh. To be great is to be misunderstood.","The only reward of virtue is virtue; the only way to have a friend is to be one.","Trust thyself: every heart vibrates to that iron string.

The rays that come from those heavenly worlds, will separate between him and vulgar things. One might think the atmosphere was made transparent with this design, to give man, in the heavenly bodies, the perpetual presence of the sublime. Seen in the streets of cities, how great they are! If the stars should appear one night in a thousand years, how would men believe and adore; and preserve for many generations the remembrance of the city of God which had been shown! But every night come out these envoys of beauty, and light the universe with their admonishing smile.","Live no longer to the expectation of these deceived and deceiving people with whom we converse. Say to them, O father, O mother, O wife, O brother, O friend, I have lived with you after appearances hitherto. Henceforward I am the truth\'s. Be it known unto you that henceforward I obey no law less than the eternal law. I will have no covenants but proximities. I shall endeavor to nourish my parents, to nourish my family, to be the chaste husband of one wife, - but these relations I must fill after a new and unprecedented way. I appeal from your customs.

Your goodness must have some edge to it--else it is none.","Solitude, the safeguard of mediocrity, is to genius the stern friend, the cold, obscure shelter where moult the wings which will bear it farther than suns and stars. He who should inspire and lead his race must be defended from travelling with the souls of other men, from living, breathing, reading, and writing in the daily, time-worn yoke of their opinions. \\"In the morning, \u2014 solitude;\\" said Pythagoras; that Nature may speak to the imagination, as she does never in company, and that her favorite may make acquaintance with those divine strengths which disclose themselves to serious and abstracted thought. \'Tis very certain that Plato, Plotinus, Archimedes, Hermes, Newton, Milton, Wordsworth, did not live in a crowd, but descended into it from time to time as benefactors: and the wise instructor will press this point of securing to the young soul in the disposition of time and the arrangements of living, periods and habits of solitude.","In the presence of nature, a wild delight runs through the man, in spite of real sorrows.

Prayer is the contemplation of the facts of life from the highest point of view. It is the soliloquy of a beholding and jubilant soul. It is the spirit of God pronouncing his works good. But prayer as a means to effect a private end is meanness and theft. It supposes dualism and not unity in nature and consciousness. As soon as the man is at one with God, he will not beg. He will then see prayer in all action. The prayer of the farmer kneeling in his field to weed it, the prayer of the rower kneeling with the stroke of his oar, are true prayers heard throughout nature, though for cheap ends.","Language is fossil poetry. As the limestone of the continent consists of infinite masses of the shells of animalcules, so language is made up of images, or tropes, which now, in their secondary use, have long ceased to remind us of their poetic origin.","One must be an inventor to read well. There is then creative reading as well as creative writing.","In good company there is never such discourse between two, across the table, as takes place when you leave them alone. In good company, the individuals merge their egotism into a social soul exactly coextensive with the several consciousnesses there present. No partialities of friend to friend, no fondnesses of brother to sister, of wife to husband, are there pertinent, but quite otherwise. Only he may then speak who can sail on the common thought of the party, and not poorly limited to his own. Now this convention, which good sense demands, destroys the high freedom of great conversation, which requires an absolute running of two souls into one.","Beware when the great God lets loose a thinker on this planet. Then all things are at risk. It is as when a conflagration has broken out in a great city, and no man knows what is safe, or where it will end. There is not a piece of science, but its flank may be turned to-morrow; there is not any literary reputation, not the so-called eternal names of fame, that may not be revised and condemned. The very hopes of man, the thoughts of his heart, the religion of nations, the manner and morals of mankind, are all at the mercy of a new generalization. Generalization is always a new influx of the divinity into the mind. Hence the thrill that attends it.","When a man is pushed, tormented, defeated, he has a chance to learn something.","Nothing is so strong as gentleness nothing so gentle as real strength","It was a high counsel that I once heard given to a young person, \\"Always do what you are afraid to do.","Do your work, and I shall know you.

I am glad to the brink of fear.","A man is what he thinks about all day long","The poet is the sayer, the namer, and represents beauty. He is a sovereign, and stands on the centre. For the world is not painted, or adorned, but is from the beginning beautiful; and God has not made some beautiful things, but Beauty is the creator of the universe. Therefore the poet is not any permissive potentate, but is emperor in his own right. Criticism is infested with a cant of materialism, which assumes that manual skill and activity is the first merit of all men, and disparages such as say and do not, overlooking the fact, that some men, namely, poets, are natural sayers, sent into the world to the end of expression, and confounds them with those whose province is action, but who quit it to imitate the sayers. The poet does not wait for the hero or the sage, but, as they act and think primarily, so he writes primarily what will and must be spoken, reckoning the others, though primaries also, yet, in respect to him, secondaries and servants; as sitters or models in the studio of a painter, or as assistants who bring building materials to an architect.","The years teach us much, which the days never knew.","Believe in yourself our strength grows out of our weakness","People seem not to see that their opinion of the world is also a confession of character.","I no doubt deserved my enemies, but I don\'t believe I deserved my friends.","So let us then be up and doing, with a heart for any fate; still achieving, still pursuing; learn to labor and to wait.","Practice radical humility.\\" He (or she)who masters the art of humility cannot be humiliated...","Can anything be so elegant as to have few wants, and to serve them one\u2019s self?","Go where there is no path and leave a trail.","To laugh often and love much; to win the respect of intelligent persons and the affection of children; to earn the approbation of honest citizens and endure the betrayal of false friends; to appreciate beauty; to find the best in others; to give of one\u2019s self; to leave the world a bit better, whether by a healthy child, a garden patch or a redeemed social condition; to have played and laughed with enthusiasm and sung with exultation; to know even one life has breathed easier because you have lived\u2014this is to have succeeded.","Never read a book that is not a year old.","To laugh often and much; to win the respect of intelligent people and the affection of children; to earn the appreciation of honest critics and endure the betrayal of false friends; to appreciate beauty, to find the best in others; to leave the world a little better; whether be a healthy child, a garden patch or a redeemed social condition; to know even one life has breathed easier because you have lived. This is the meaning of success.","In art the hand can never execute anything higher than the heart can inspire.","That second man has his own way of looking at things; asks himself which debt must I pay first, the debt to the rich, or the debt to the poor? the debt of money, or the debt of thought to mankind, of genius to nature? For you, O broker! there is no other principle but arithmetic. For me, commerce is of trivial import; love, faith, truth of character, the aspiration of man, these are sacred; nor can I detach one duty, like you, from all other duties, and concentrate my forces mechanically on the payment of moneys. Let me live onward; you shall find that, though slower, the progress of my character will liquidate all these debts without injustice to higher claims. If a man should dedicate himself to the payment of notes, would not this be injustice? Does he owe no debt but money? And are all claims on him to be postponed to a landlord\'s or a banker\'s?","The man who knows how will always have a job. The man who knows why will always be his boss.","We talk of choosing our friends, but our friends are self-elected.","The accepted and betrothed lover has lost the wildest charm of his maiden in her acceptance of him. She was heaven whilst he pursued her as a star: she cannot be heaven, if she stoops to such a one as he.","Let the reader find that he cannot afford to omit any line of your writing because you have omitted every word that he can spare.","Society never advances. It recedes as fast on one side as it gains on the other. It undergoes continual changes; it is barbarous, it is civilized, it is christianized, it is rich, it is scientific; but this change is not amelioration. For every thing that is given, something is taken. Society acquires new arts, and loses old instincts. What a contrast between the well-clad, reading, writing, thinking American, with a watch, a pencil, and a bill of exchange in his pocket, and the naked New Zealander, whose property is a club, a spear, a mat, and an undivided twentieth of a shed to sleep under! But compare the health of the two men, and you shall see that the white man has lost his aboriginal strength. If the traveller tell us truly, strike the savage with a broad axe, and in a day or two the flesh shall unite and heal as if you struck the blow into soft pitch, and the same blow shall send the white to his grave.The civilized man has built a coach, but has lost the use of his feet. He is supported on crutches, but lacks so much support of muscle. He has a fine Geneva watch, but he fails of the skill to tell the hour by the sun. A Greenwich nautical almanac he has, and so being sure of the information when he wants it, the man in the street does not know a star in the sky. The solstice he does not observe; the equinox he knows as little; and the whole bright calendar of the year is without a dial in his mind. His note-books impair his memory; his libraries overload his wit; the insurance-office increases the number of accidents; and it may be a question whether machinery does not encumber; whether we have not lost by refinement some energy, by a Christianity entrenched in establishments and forms, some vigor of wild virtue. For every Stoic was a Stoic; but in Christendom where is the Christian?","In a library we are surrounded by many hundreds of dear friends, but they are imprisoned by an enchanter in these paper and leathern boxes; and though they know us, and have been waiting two, ten, or twenty centuries for us,\u2014some of them,\u2014and are eager to give us a sign and unbosom themselves, it is the law of their limbo that they must not speak until spoken to; and as the enchanter has dressed them, like battalions of infantry, in coat and jacket of one cut, by the thousand and ten thousand, your chance of hitting on the right one is to be computed by the arithmetical rule of Permutation and Combination,\u2014not a choice out of three caskets, but out of half a million caskets, all alike.","It is the harder, because you will always find those who think they know what is your duty better than you know it. It is easy in the world to live after the world\'s opinion; it is easy in solitude to live after our own; but the great man is he who in the midst of the crowd keeps with perfect sweetness the independence of solitude.","So much of our time is preparation, so much is routine, and so much retrospect, that the path of each man\'s genius contracts itself to a very few hours.","Ah, so you shall be sure to be misunderstood.\\" -Is it so bad, then to be misunderstood? Pythagoras was misunderstood, and Socrates, and Jesus, and Luther, and Copernicus, and Galileo, and Newton, and every pure and wise spirit that ever took flesh. To be great is to be misunderstood...","She shows us only surfaces but Nature is a million fathoms deep.","Years teach much which the days never knew.","Evil is ignorance.","Knowledge is knowing that we cannot know.","There is no knowledge that is not power.","Else if you would be a man speak what you think to-day in words as hard as cannon balls, and to-morrow speak what tomorrow thinks in hard words again, though it contradict every thing you said to-day.","Setiap buku adalah kutipan; setiap rumah adalah kutipan seluruh rimba raya dan tambang-tambang dan bebatuan; setiap manusia adalah kutipan dari semua leluhurnya","Things are in the saddle,And ride mankind.","With consistency a great soul has simply nothing to do.

Pythagoras was misunderstood, and Socrates, and Jesus, and Luther, and Copernicus, and Galileo, and Newton, and every pure and wise spirit that ever took flesh. To be great is to be misunderstood.","It is not metres, but a metre-making argument that makes a poem,\u2014a thought so passionate and alive that like the spirit of a plant or an animal it has an architecture of its own, and adorns nature with a new thing. The thought and the form are equal in the order of time, but in the order of genesis the thought is prior to the form.","What I must do, is all that concerns me, not what the people think.","Every revolution was first a thought in one man\'s mind, and when the same thought occurs to another man, it is the key to that era.","The imitator dooms himself to hopeless mediocrity. The inventor did it, because it was natural to him, and so in him it has a charm. In the imitator, something else is natural, and he bereaves himself of his own beauty, to come short of another man\'s.","My life is for itself and not for a spectacle. I much prefer that it should be of a lower strain, so it be genuine and equal, than that it should be glittering and unsteady. I wish it to be sound and sweet, and not to need diet and bleeding","Who you are is speaking so loudly that I can\'t hear what you\'re saying","He will perceive that there are far more excellent qualities in the student than preciseness and infallibility; that a guess is often more fruitful than an indisputable affirmation, and that a dream may let us deeper into the secret of nature than a hundred concerted experiments","If we are related, we shall meet.

This universal soul, he calls Reason: it is not mine, or thine, or his, but we are its; we are its property and men. And the blue sky in which the private earth is buried, the sky with its eternal calm, and full of everlasting orbs, is the type of Reason. That which, intellectually considered, we call Reason, considered in relation to nature, we call Spirit. Spirit is the Creator. Spirit hath life in itself.

History and exact science he must learn by laborious reading. Colleges, in like manner, have their indispensable office, - to teach elements. But they can only highly serve us, when they aim not to drill, but to create; when they gather from far every ray of various genius to their hospitable halls, and, by the concentrated fires, set the hearts of their youth on flame. Thought and knowledge are natures in which apparatus and pretension avail nothing. Gowns, and pecuniary foundations, though of towns of gold, can never countervail the least sentence or syllable of wit. Forget this, and our American colleges will recede in their public importance, whilst they grow richer every year.","The life of man is a self-evolving circle, which, from a ring imperceptibly small, rushes on all sides outwards to new and larger circles, and that without end. The extent to which this generation of circles, wheel without wheel, will go, depends on the force or truth of the individual soul.","nature is not always tricked in holiday attire, but the same scene which yesterday breathed perfume and glittered as for the frolic of the nymphs, is overspread with melancholy today.

Thoughts come into our minds by avenues which we never left open, and thoughts go out of our minds through avenues which we never voluntarily opened.","Those who are esteemed umpires of taste, are often persons who have acquired some knowledge of admired pictures or sculptures, and have an inclination for whatever is elegant; but if you inquire whether they are beautiful souls, and whether their own acts are like fair pictures, you learn that they are selfish and sensual. Their cultivation is local, as if you should rub a log of dry wood in one spot to produce fire, all the rest remaining cold. Their knowledge of the fine arts is some study of rules and particulars, or some limited judgment of color or form which is exercised for amusement or for show. It is a proof of the shallowness of the doctrine of beauty, as it lies in the minds of our amateurs, that men seem to have lost the perception of the instant dependence of form upon soul.","The day is always (hers or) his, who works in it with serenity and great aims.","To speak truly, few adult persons can see nature. Most persons do not see the sun. At least they have a very superficial seeing. The sun illuminates only the eye of the man, but shines into the eye and the heart of the child. The lover of nature is he whose inward and outward senses are still truly adjusted to each other; who has retained the spirit of infancy even into the era of manhood. His intercourse with heaven and earth, becomes part of his daily food. In the presence of nature, a wild delight runs through the man, in spite of real sorrows.","One of the illusions of life is that the present hour is not the critical, decisive hour. Write it on your heart that every day is the best day in the year. No man has learned anything rightly, until he knows that every day is Doomsday.","God will not have his work made manifest by cowards.","Don\u2019t say things. What you are stands over you the while, and thunders so that I cannot hear what you say to the contrary.","The most wonderful inspirations die with their subject, if he has no hand to paint them to the senses.","The beauty that shimmers in the yellow afternoons of October, who ever could clutch it?","sorrow makes us all children again-destroys all differences of intellect. the wisest know nothing.","Nature is a mutable cloud which is always and never the same","There are no days in life that are so memorable as those that vibrate to some stroke of the imagination.","Our moods do not believe in each other. To-day I am full of thoughts and can write what I please. I see no reason why I should not have the same thought, the same power of expression, to-morrow. What I write, whilst I write it, seems the most natural thing in the world: but yesterday I saw a dreary vacuity in this direction in which now I see so much; and a month hence, I doubt not, I shall wonder who he was that wrote so many continuous pages.","In the work of a writer of genius, we rediscover our own neglected thoughts.","the sense of being which in calm hours arises, we know not how, in the soul, is not diverse from things, from space, from light, from time, from man, but one with them and proceeds obviously from the same source.... Here is the fountain of action and of thought.... We lie in the lap of immense intelligence.","Every action is measured by the depth of the sentiment from which it proceeds.","Work and learn in evil days, in insulted days, in days of debt and depression and calamity. Fight best in the shade of the cloud of arrows.","Debt, grinding debt, whose iron face the widow, the orphan, and the sons of genius fear and hate;--debt, which consumes so much time, which so cripples and disheartens a great spirit with cares that seem so base, is a preceptor whose lessons cannot be forgone, and is needed most by those who suffer from it most.","All great speakers were bad speakers at first.","Some of your hurts you have cured, and the sharpest you\'ve even survived. But what torments of grief you\'ve endured from evils which never arrived - Ralph Waldo Emerson","The influence of the senses has, in most men, overpowered the mind to the degree that the walls of time and space have come to look real and insurmountable; and to speak with levity of these limits is, in the world, the sign of insanity. Yet, time and space are but inverse measures of the force of the soul.","The desire of gold is not for gold. It is for the means of freedom and benefit.","There\u2019s nothing capricious in nature, and the implanting of a desire indicates that its gratification is in the constitution of the creature that feels it.","A man is a god in ruins.When men are innocent,life shall be longer and shall pass into the immortal, as gently as we awake from dreams","In the woods, we return to reason and faith. There I feel that nothing can befall me in life,\u2014no disgrace, no calamity, (leaving me my eyes,) which nature cannot repair.","Good luck is another name for tenacity of purpose.","Fear and hope are alike beneath it. There is somewhat low even in hope. In the hour of vision, there is nothing that can be called gratitude, nor properly joy. The soul raised over passion beholds identity and eternal causation, perceives the self-existence of Truth and Right, and calms itself with knowing that all things go well. Vast spaces of nature, the Atlantic Ocean, the South Sea, \u2014 long intervals of time, years, centuries, \u2014 are of no account. This which I think and feel underlay every former state of life and circumstances, as it does underlie my present, and what is called life, and what is called death.","For nonconformity the world whips you with its displeasure. And therefore a man must know how to estimate a sour face. The by-standers look askance on him in the public street or in the friend\u2019s parlour. If this aversation had its origin in contempt and resistance like his own, he might well go home with a sad countenance; but the sour faces of the multitude, like their sweet faces, have no deep cause, but are put on and off as the wind blows and a newspaper directs.","All conservatives are such from personal defects. They have been effeminated by position or nature, born halt and blind, through luxury of their parents, and can only, like invalids, act on the defensive.","I do not wish to treat friendships daintily, but with the roughest courage. When they are real, they are not glass threads or frost-work, but the solidest thing we know.","The South-wind bringsLife, sunshine and desire,And on every mount and meadowBreathes aromatic fire;But over the dead he has no power,The lost, the lost, he cannot restore;And, looking over the hills, I mournThe darling who shall not return.","We are never tired so long as we can see far enough.","The poet is the sayer, the namer, and represents beauty.","A man is a hero, not because he is braver than anyone else, but because he is brave for ten minutes longer.","The stars awaken a certain reverence, because though always present, they are inaccessible","Our life is an apprenticeship to the truth that around every circle another can be drawn; that there is no end in nature, but every end is a beginning; that there is always another dawn risen on midnoon,and under every deep a lower deep opens.","Let me admonish you, first of all, to go alone; to refuse the good models, even those most sacred in the imagination of men, and dare to love God without mediator or veil.","To believe your own thought, to believe that what is true for you in your private heart is true for all men, \u2014 that is genius. Speak your latent conviction, and it shall be the universal sense; for the inmost in due time becomes the outmost,\u2014\u2014 and our first thought is rendered back to us by the trumpets of the Last Judgment.","The sense of being perfectly well-dressed gives a feeling of tranquility that religion is powerless to bestow.","the mystic must be steadily told,\u2014All that you say is just as true without the tedious use of that symbol as with it. Let us have a little algebra, instead of this trite rhetoric,\u2014universal signs, instead of these village symbols,\u2014and we shall both be gainers. The history of hierarchies seems to show that all religious error consisted in making the symbol too stark and solid, and was at last nothing but an excess of the organ of language.","Thought is the property of those only who can entertain it. -","Time and space are but physiological colors which the eye makes, but the soul is light; where it is, is day; where it was, is night; and history is an impertinence and an injury, if it be any thing more than a cheerful apologue or parable of my being and becoming.","What would be the use of immortality to a person who cannot use well half an hour?","It is easy in the world to live after the world\u2019s opinion; it is easy in solitude to live after our own; but the great man is he who in the midst of the crowd keeps with perfect sweetness the independence of solitude.","A difference of taste in jokes, is a great strain on the affections.","To fill the hour - that is happiness, to fill the hour and leave no crevice for a repentance or an approval.","The true test of civilization is not the census, nor the size of the cities, nor the crops \u2013 no, but the kind of man the country turns out.","The poets made all the words and therefore language is the archives of history, and, if we must say it, a sort of tomb of the muses. For though the origin of most of our words is forgotten, each word was at first a stroke of genius, and obtained currency because for the moment it symbolized the world to the first speaker and to the hearer. The etymologist finds the deadest word to have been once a brilliant picture. Language is fossil poetry.","The days come and go like muffled and veiled figures sent from a distant party, but they say nothing, and if we do not use the gifts they bring, they carry them as silently away.","I must be myself. I cannot break myself any longer for you, or you. If you can love me for what I am, we shall be the happier.","There is one mind common to all individual men. Every man is an inlet to the same and to all of the same. He that is once admitted to the right of reason is made a freeman of the whole estate. What Plato has thought, he may think; what a saint has felt, he may feel; what at any time has befallen any man, he can understand. Who hath access to this universal mind is a party to all that is or can be done, for this is the only and sovereign agent.","I am only an experimenter. Do not set the least value on what I do, or the least discredit on what I do not, as if I pretended to settle any thing as true or false. I unsettle all things. No facts are to me sacred; none are profane; I simply experiment, an endless seeker.","Dream delivers us to dream and there is no end to illusion.","Place yourself in the middle of the stream of power and wisdom which animates all whom it floats, and you are without effort impelled to truth, to right and a perfect contentment.","Every actual State is corrupt. Good men must not obey laws too well.","None believeth in the soul of man, but only in some man or person old and departed. Ah me! no man goeth alone. All men go in flocks to this saint or that poet, avoiding the God who seeth in secret. They cannot see in secret; they love to be blind in public. They think society is wiser than their soul, and know not that one soul, and their soul, is wiser than the whole world.","A man must consider what a blindman\'s-buff is this game of conformity. If I know your sect, I anticipate your argument. I hear a preacher announce for his text and topic the expediency of one of the institutions of his church.Do I not know beforehand that not possibly can he say a new and spontaneous word? Do I not know that, with all this ostentation of examining the grounds of the institution, he will do no such thing? Do I not know that he is pledged to himself not to look but at one side, \u2014 the permitted side, not as a man, but as a parish minister? He is a retained attorney, and these airs of the bench are the emptiest affectation. Well, most men have bound their eyes with one or another handkerchief, and attached themselves to some one of these communities of opinion. This conformity makes them not false in a few particulars, authors of a few lies, but false in all particulars. Their every truth is not quite true. Their two is not the real two, their four not the real four; so that every word they say chagrins us, and we know not where to begin to set them right. Meantime nature is not slow to equip us in the prison-uniform of the party to which we adhere. We come to wear one cut of face and figure, and acquire by degrees the gentlest asinine expression.","That popular fable of the sot who was picked up dead drunk in the street, carried to the duke\'s house, washed and dressed and laid in the duke\'s bed, and, on his waking, treated with all obsequious ceremony like the duke, and assured that he had been insane, owes its popularity to the fact, that it symbolizes so well the state of man, who is in the world a sort of sot, but now and then wakes up, exercises his reason, and finds himself a true prince.","These roses under my window make no reference to former roses or to better ones; they are for what they are; they exist with God to-day. There is no time to them. There is simply the rose; it is perfect in every moment of its existence.","Valor consists in the power of self-recovery, so that a man cannot have his flank turned, cannot be out-generalled, but put him where you will, he stands. This can only be by his preferring truth to his past apprehension of truth; and his alert acceptance of it, from whatever quarter; the intrepid conviction that his laws, his relations to society, his Christianity, his world may at any time be superseded and decease.","He has seen but half the universe who never has been shown the house of Pain.","a man only knows what he\'s experienced","Why covet a knowledge of new facts? Day and night, house and garden, a few books, a few actions, serve us as well as would all trades and all spectacles. We are far from having exhausted the significance of the few symbols we use. We can come to use them yet with a terrible simplicity.","Most of the shadows of this life are caused by our standing in our own sunshine","If the single man plants himself indomitably on his instincts, and there abides, this huge world will come around to him.","People go out to look at sunrises and sunsets who do not recognize their own, quietly and happily, but know that it is foreign to them. As they do by books, so they quote the sunset and the star, and do not make them theirs. Worse yet, they live as foreigners in a world of truth, and quote thoughts, and thus disown them. Quotation confesses inferiority","Truth, and goodness, and beauty are but different faces of the same all.","Do not say things. Who you are thunders over you all the while so that I cannot hear what you say to the contrary.","Life goes headlong. We chase some flying scheme, or we are hunted by some fear or command behind us. But if suddenly we encounter a friend, we pause; our heat and hurry look foolish enough; now pause, now possession, is required, and the power to swell the moment from the resources of the heart. The moment is all, in all noble relations.","Nothing is at last sacred but the integrity of our own mind.","It is not the length of life, but the depth of life. He who is not everyday conquering some fear has not learned the secret of life.","In the woods, we return to reason and faith.","People are to be taken in very small doses. Nothing can bring you peace but yourself.","Insist on yourself; never imitate. Your own gift you can present every moment with the cumulative force of a whole life\u2019s cultivation; but of the adopted talent of another you have only an extemporaneous, half possession. That which each can do best, none but his Maker can teach him. No man yet knows what it is, nor can, till that person has exhibited it. Where is the master who could have taught Shakespeare? Where is the master who could have instructed Franklin, or Washington or Bacon, or Newton? Every great man is unique.","Every man\'s condition is a solution in hieroglyphic to those inquiries he would put. He acts it as life, before he apprehends it as truth. In like manner, nature is already, in its forms and tendencies, describing its own design. Let us interrogate the great apparition, that shines so peacefully around us. Let us inquire, to what end is nature?","There is then creative reading as well as creative writing. When the mind is braced by labor and invention, the page of whatever book we read becomes luminous with manifold allusion. -Ralph Waldo Emerson, writer and philosopher (1803-1882)","Books are the best type of influence of the past...Each age, it is found, must write its own books; or rather, each generation for the next succeeding. The books of an older period will not fit this.","Harder still it has proved to rule the dragon Money\u2026 A whole generation adopted false principles, and went to their graves in the belief they were enriching the country they were impoverishing.","A mind might ponder its thought for ages, and not gain so much self-knowledge as the passion of love shall teach it in a day.","To stand in true relations with men in a false age is worth a fit of insanity, is it not?","Life is too short to wasteThe critic bite or cynic bark,Quarrel, or reprimand;\'Twill soon be dark;Up! mind thine own aim, andGod speed the mark!","In the woods is perpetual youth. In the woods we return to faith and reason.","The soul is the perceiver and revealer of truth. We know the truth when we see it, let skeptic and scoffer say what they choose.","Insist on yourself; never imitate.","The soul is superior to its knowledge; wiser than any of its works.","Beauty will not come at the call of a legislature, nor will it repeat in England or America its history in Greece. It will come, as always, unannounced, and spring up between the feet of brave and earnest men.","My friends have come to me unsought. The great God gave them to me.","Thinking is the function. Living is the functionary.","A friend is a person with whom I may be sincere.","What we fear of doing most is usually what we most need to do.","As long as all that is said is said against me, I feel a certain sublime assurance of success, but as soon as honied words of praise are spoken for me, I feel as one that lies unprotected before his enemies.","For all our penny-wisdom, for all out soul-destroying slavery to habit, it is not to be doubted that all men have sublime thoughts.","Concentration is the secret of strength in politics, in war, in trade, in short in all management of human affairs","Life is our dictionary","The World exists for you ; Build therefore your own world","Tomorrow, a stranger will say with masterly good sense precisely what we have thought and felt all the time.","The mind of this country, taught to aim at low objects, feeds upon itself.","Other men are lenses through which we read our own minds.","The word miracle, as pronounced by Christian churches, gives a false impression; it is a monster. It is not one with the blowing clover and the falling rain.","Great men exist that there may be greater men.","Poetry must be as new as foam, and as old as the rock.","There is properly no history; only biography.","All that we call sacred history attests that the birth of a poet is the principal event in chronology.","I have no churlish objection to the circumnavigation of the globe, for the purposes of art, of study, and benevolence, so that the man is first domesticated, or does not go abroad with the hope of finding somewhat greater than he knows. He who travels to be amused, or to get somewhat which he does not carry, travels away from himself, and grows old even in youth among old things","Books are the best of things, well used; abused, among the worst. What is the right use? What is the one end which all means go to effect? They are for nothing but to inspire. I had better never see a book than to be warped by its attraction clean out of my own orbit, and made a satellite instead of a system.","I do not wish to expiate, but to live. My life is not an apology, but a life.","And truly it demands something godlike in him who has cast off the common motives of humanity, and has ventured to trust himself for a taskmaster. High be his heart, faithful his will, clear his sight, that he may in good earnest be doctrine, society, law, to himself, that a simple purpose may be to him as strong as iron necessity is to others!","The charming landscape which I saw this morning, is indubitably made up of some twenty or thirty farms. Miller owns this field, Locke that, and Manning the woodland beyond. But none of them owns the landscape. There is a property in the horizon which no man has but he whose eye can integrate all the parts, that is, the poet. This is the best part of these men\'s farms, yet to this their warranty-deeds give no title.","PoetTo mask the fiery thought,in simple words succeeds.For still the craft of genius is,To mask a king in weeds","In happy hours, nature appears to us one with art; art perfected, -- the work of genius. And the individual, in whom simple tastes and susceptibility to all the great human influences overpower the accidents of a local and special culture, is the best critic of art. Though we travel the world over to find the beautiful, we must carry it with us, or we find it not.","The objection to conforming to usages that have become dead to you is, that it scatters your force. It loses your time and blurs the impression of your character. If you maintain a dead church, contribute to a dead Bible-society, vote with a great party either for the government or against it, spread your table like base housekeepers, under all these screens I have difficulty to detect the precise man you are.And, of course, so much force is withdrawn from your proper life. But do your work, and I shall know you. Do your work, and you shall reinforce yourself. A man must consider what a blindman\'s-buff is this game of conformity. If I know your sect, I anticipate your argument. I hear a preacher announce for his text and topic the expediency of one of the institutions of his church.","Existentialism \u201cevery appearance in nature corresponds to some state of the mind, we have entered the familiar Wordsworthian Romantic territory in which nature is phenomena and spirit is noumena and the task of the human person is to draw his being from whatever inscrutable force produces, organizes, and infuses the phenomenal universe \u2014an \u201cineffable essence which we call Spirit. Being as not being stable but forever in flux and transition. Even history, Which seems obviously about the past, has its true use as the servant of the present.\' Emerson and Buddhism stand for spirituality purged of creed detritus.\' the essence of Existentialism is that you find meaning in nature, wisdom, mind and body.\u201d","Every man contemplates an angel in his future self","The man is the head of the house but the woman is the neck that turns the head.","There are no fixtures in nature. The universe is fluid and volatile. Permanence is but a word of degrees. Our globe seen by God is a transparent law, not a mass of facts. The law dissolves the fact and holds it fluid.","Leave this touching and clawing. Let him be to me a spirit. A message, a thought, a sincerity, a glance from him, I want, but not news nor pottage. I can get politics, and chat, and neighborly conveniences from cheaper companions. Should not the society of my friend be to me poetic, pure, universal, and great as nature itself? Ought I to feel that our tie is profane in comparison with yonder bar of cloud that sleeps on the horizon, or that clump of waving grass that divides the brook? Let us not vilify, bur raise it to that standard. That great, defying eye, that scornful beauty of his mien and action, do not pique yourself on reducing, but rather fortify and enhance.","Ideas must work through the brains and arms of men, or they are no better than dreams","His hidden meaning lies in our endeavors;Our valors are our best gods.","Nothing is rich but the inexhaustible wealth of nature. She shows us only surfaces, but she is a million fathoms deep.","It could be said that a single person has written all the books in the world such central unity is in them that they are undeniably the work of a single all-knowing master.","The philosophy of six thousand years has not searched the chambers and magazines of the soul. In its experiments there has always remained, in the last analysis, a residuum it could not resolve. Man is a stream whose source is hidden.","Man hopes, genius creates","I will receive from them not what they have but what they are.","A great man quotes bravely, and will not draw on his invention when his memory serves him with a word just as good.","Whatever limits us,we call Fate","Old and new make the warp and woof of every moment. There is no thread that is not a twist of these two strands. By necessity, by proclivity, and by delight, we all quote.","A moody child and wildly wisePursued the game with joyful eyes,Which chose, like meteors, their way,And rived the dark with private ray:They overleapt the horizon\'s edge,Searched with Apollo\'s privilege;Through man, and woman, and sea, and star,Saw the dance of nature forward far;Through worlds, and races, and terms, and times,Saw musical order, and pairing rhymes.Olympian bards who sungDivine ideas below,Which always find us young,And always keep us so.","Things are pretty, graceful, rich, elegant, handsome, but until they speak to the imagination, not yet beautiful. This is the reason why beauty is still escaping out of all analysis. It is not yet possessed, it cannot be handled. \u2026It instantly deserts possession, and flies to an object in the horizon. If I could put my hand on the north star, would it be as beautiful? The sea is lovely, but when we bathe in it, the beauty forsakes all the near water. For the imagination and senses cannot be gratified at the same time.","Men are conservatives when they are least vigorous, or when they are most luxurious. They are conservatives after dinner.","Every[one] I meet is in some way my superior.","We are always getting ready to live, but never living.","It is a secret which every intellectual man quickly learns, that, beyond the energy of his possessed and conscious intellect, he is capable of a new energy (as of an intellect doubled on itself), by abandonment to the nature of things; that, beside his privacy of power as an individual man, there is a great public power, on which he can draw, by unlocking, at all risks, his human doors, and suffering the ethereal tides to roll and circulate through him: then is he caught up into the life of the Universe, his speech is thunder, his thought is law, and his words are universally intelligible as the plants and animals.","Whatever you do you need courage.Whatever course you decide upon, there will always be someone to tell you that you are wrong.","I know too well how slowly we edge along sideways to every thing good & brilliant in our lives & how casually and unobservedly we make all our most valued acquaintances.","This is the history of governments, - one man does something which is to bind another. A man who cannot be acquainted with me, taxes me; looking from afar at me, ordains that a part of my labour shall go to this or that whimsical end, not as I, but as he happens to fancy. Behold the consequence. Of all debts, men are least willing to pay the taxes. What a satire is this on government! Everywhere they think they get their money\'s worth, except for these. Hence, the less government we have, the better, - the fewer laws, and the less confided power. The antidote to this abuse of formal Government, is, the influence of private character, the growth of the Individual; the appearance of the principal to supersede the proxy; the appearance of the wise man, of whom the existing government, is, it must be owned, but a shabby imitation. That which all things tend to educe, which freedom, cultivation, intercourse, revolutions, go to form and deliver, is character; that is the end of nature, to reach unto this coronation of her king. To educate the wise man, the State exists; and with the appearance of the wise man, the State expires. The appearance of character makes the State unnecessary. The wise man is the State. He needs no army, fort, or navy, - he loves men too well; no bribe, or feast, or palace, to draw friends to him; no vantage ground, no favourable circumstance. He needs no library, for he has not done thinking; no church, for he is a prophet; no statute book, for he has the lawgiver; no money, for he is value; no road, for he is at home where he is; no experience, for the life of the creator shoots through him, and looks from his eyes. He has no personal friends, for he who has the spell to draw the prayer and piety of all men unto him, needs not husband and educate a few, to share with him a select and poetic life. His relation to men is angelic; his memory is myrrh to them; his presence, frankincense and flowers.","A sunset a forest a snow storm a certain river view are more to me than many friends.","Vast spaces of nature; the Atlantic Ocean, the South Sea; vast intervals of time, years, centuries, are of no account. This which I think and feel, underlay that former state of life and circumstances, as it does underlie my present, and will always circumstance, and what is called life, and what is called death.","To laugh often and love much; to win the respect of intelligent people and the affection of children; to earn the appreciation of honest critics and to endure the betrayal of false friends. To appreciate beauty; to find the best in others; to leave the world a bit better whether by a healthy child, a garden patch, or a redeemed social condition; to know that even one life has breathed easier because you have lived. This is to have succeeded.","What you are, comes to you.","Outside, among your fellows, among strangers, you must perceive appearances, a hundred things you cannot do; but inside, the terrible freedom!","Fame is proof that people are gullible.","My life is not an apology, but a life. It is for itself and not for a spectacle. I much prefer that it should be of a lower strain, so it be genuine and equal, than that it should be glittering and unsteady. I wish it to be sound and sweet, and not to need diet and bleeding. My life should be unique; it should be an alms, a battle, a conquest, a medicine.","Without a rich heart, wealth is an ugly beggar","But here we are; and, if we tarry a little, we may come to learn that here is best. See to it, only, that thyself is here;-and art and nature, hope and fate, friends, angels, and the Supreme Being, shall not be absent from the chamber which thou sittest.","The efforts which we make to escape from our destiny only serve to lead us into it","May you always do what you are afraid to do.","The ruin or blank, that we see when we look at nature is in our own eye...Love is as much its demand, as perception. Indeed neither can be perfect without the other.","I do not wish to expiate, but to live. My life is for itself and not for a spectacle.

This rule, equally arduous in actual and in intellectual life, may serve for the whole distinction between greatness and meanness. It is the harder, because you will always find those who think they know what is your duty better than you know it. It is easy in the world to live after the world\'s opinion; it is easy in solitude to live after our own; but the great man is he who in the midst of the crowd keeps with perfect sweetness the independence of solitude. [172]","Everything Real Is Self-Existent.","For the Universe has three children, born at one time, which reappear under different names in every system of thought, whether they be called cause, operation and effect; or, more poetically, Jove, Pluto, Neptune; or, theologically, the Father, the Spirit and the Son; but which we will call here the Knower, the Doer and the Sayer. These stand respectively for the love of truth, for the love of good, and for the love of beauty. These three are equal. Each is that which he is, essentially, so that he cannot be surmounted or analyzed, and each of these three has the power of the others latent in him and his own, patent.","What I must do is all that concerns me, not what the people think.

A sturdy lad from New Hampshire or Vermont, who in turn tries all the professions, who teams it, farms it, peddles, keeps a school, preaches, edits a newspaper, goes to Congress, buys a township, and so forth, in successive years, and always, like a cat, falls on his feet, is worth a hundred of these city dolls. He walks abreast with his days, and feels no shame in not \'studying a profession,\' for he does not postpone his life, but lives already.","When the eyes say one thing, and the tongue another, a practical man relies on the language of the first.","The sky is less grand as it shuts down over less worth in the population.","The great majority of men are bundles of beginnings.","I launch eagerly into this resounding tumult.","For poetry was all written before time was, and whenever we are so finely organized that we can penetrate into that region where the air is music, we hear those primal warblings and attempt to write them down, but we lose ever and anon a word or a verse and substitute something of our own, and thus miswrite the poem. The men of more delicate ear write down these cadences more faithfully, and these transcripts, though imperfect, become the songs of the nations.","As many thoughts in succession substantiate themselves, we shall by and by stand in a new world of our own creation, and no longer strangers and pilgrims in a traditionary globe. My friends have come to me unsought.... Will these, too, seperate themselves from me again, or some of them? I know not, but I fear it not; for my relation to them is so pure, that we hold by simple affinity, and the Genius of my life being thus social, the same affinity will exert its energy on whomsoever is as noble as these men and women, wherever I may be.","Thought is the bud, language the blossom and action the fruit behind it.","Nature, in its ministry to man, is not only the material, but is also the process and the result. All the parts incessantly work into each other\'s hands for the profit of man. The wind sows the seed; the sun evaporates the sea; the wind blows the vapor to the field; the ice, on the other side of the planet, condenses rain on this; the rain feeds the plant; the plant feeds the animal; and thus the endless circulations of the divine charity nourish man.","I grieve that grief can teach me nothing.","Friend, client, child, sickness, fear, want, charity, all knock at once at thy closet door, and say, \u2018Come out unto us.\u2019 But keep thy state; come not into their confusion. The power men possess to annoy me, I give them by a weak curiosity. No man can come near me but through my act. \u201cWhat we love that we have, but by desire we bereave ourselves of the love.","The learned and the studious of thought have no monopoly of wisdom. Their violence of direction in some degree disqualifies them to think truly. We owe many valuable observations to people who are not very acute or profound, and who say the thing without effort which we want and have long been hunting in vain.","if we shall take the good we find,asking no questions,we shall have heaping measures.","Foolish people ask you, when you speak what they do not wish to hear, \\"How do you know it is the truth, and not an error of your own?\\" We know the truth when we see it, from opinion, as we know when we are awake that we are awake.","My book should smell of pines and resound with the hum of insects. The swallow over my window should interweave that thread or straw he carries in his bill into my web also. We pass for what we are. Character teaches above our wills.","Never miss an opportunity of noticing anything of beauty ...","Enthusiasm is one of the most powerful engines of success. When you do a thing do it with all your might. Be active, be energetic, be enthusiastic and faithful, and you will accomplish your objective. \\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t~","That which we persist on doing becomes easier, not that the nature of the task has changed , but our ability to do has increased.","Another sort of false prayers are our regrets. Discontent is the want of self-reliance: it is infirmity of will. Regret calamities, if you can thereby help the sufferer; if not, attend your own work, and already the evil begins to be repaired. Our sympathy is just as base. We come to them who weep foolishly, and sit down and cry for company, instead of imparting to them truth and health in rough electric shocks, putting them once more in communication with their own reason. The secret of fortune is joy in our hands. Welcome evermore to gods and men is the self-helping man. For him all doors are flung wide: him all tongues greet, all honors crown, all eyes follow with desire.","This time, like all times, is a very good time - if we but know what to do with it","We live in succession, in division, in parts, in particles. Meantime within man is the soul of the whole; the wise silence; the universal beauty, to which every part and particle is equally related, the eternal ONE. And this deep power in which we exist and whose beatitude is all accessible to us, is not only self-sufficing and perfect in every hour, but the act of seeing and the thing seen, the seer and the spectacle, the subject and the object, are one. We see the world piece by piece, as the sun, the moon, the animal, the tree; but the whole, of which these are shining parts, is the soul\\"~","Beauty is its own excuse for being.","The divine bards are the friends of my virtue, of my intellect, of my strength. They admonish me that the gleams which flash across my mind are not mine, but God\'s; they had the like, and were not disobedient to the heavenly vision","The wise man through an excess of wisdom is made a fool.","The etymologist finds the deadest words to have been once a brilliant picture. Language is fossil poetry.","Ralph Waldo Emerson\u201cDo not go where the path may lead, go instead where there is no path and leave a trail.\u2015 Ralph Waldo Emerson\u201d","Of that ineffable essence which we call Spirit, he that thinks most, will say least.","Unless you try to do something beyond what you have already mastered you will never grow.","Line in nature is not found;Unit and universe are round;In vain produced, all rays return;Evil will bless, and ice will burn.","Let us affront and reprimand the smooth mediocrity and squalid contentment of the times, and hurl in the face of custom and trade and office, the fact which is the upshot of all history, that there is a great responsible Thinker and Actor working wherever a man works; that a true man belongs to no other time or place, but is the centre of things. Where he is, there is nature. He measures you and all men and all events.","If we suddenly plant our foot, and say, \u2014 I will neither eat nor drink nor wear nor touch any food or fabric which I do not know to be innocent, or deal with any person whose whole manner of life is not clear and rational, we shall stand still. Whose is so? Not mine; not thine; not his. But I think we must clear ourselves each one by the interrogation, whether we have earned our bread to-day by the hearty contribution of our energies to the common benefit? and we must not cease to tend to the correction of these flagrant wrongs, by laying one stone aright every day.","The difference between men is in their principle of association. Some men classify objects by color and size and other accidents of appearance; others by intrinsic likeness, or by the relation of cause and effect. The progress of the intellect is to the clearer vision of causes, which neglects surface differences. To the poet, to the philosopher, to the saint, all things are friendly and sacred, all events profitable, all days holy, all men divine. For the eye is fastened on the life, and slights the circumstance. Every chemical substance, every plant, every animal in its growth, teaches the unity of cause, the variety of appearance.","Sesuatu yang hebat tidak bisa dicapai tanpa semangat yang besar.","Hidup ini tidak terlalu pendek, jadi kita memiliki banyak kesempatan untuk berbuat baik.","The true poem is the poet\'s mind; the true ship is the ship-builder. In the man, could we lay him open, we should see the reason for the last flourish and tendril of his work; as every spine and tint in the sea-shell preexist in the secreting organs of the fish.","The dull pray; the geniuses are light mockers.","To know that even one life has breathed easier because I have lived. That is to have succeeded.","See yonder leafless tree against the sky,How they diffuse themselves into the air,And ever subdividing separate,Limbs into branches, branches into twigs,As if they loved the element, & hastedTo dissipate their being into it.","The creation of a thousand forests is in one acorn, and Egypt, Greece, Rome, Gaul, Britain, America, lie folded already in the first man.","I found when I had finished my new lecture that it was a very good house, only the architect had unfortunately omitted the stairs.","There may be two or three or four steps, according to the genius of each, but for every seeing soul there are two absorbing facts, --I and the abyss.","Trust thyself: every heart vibrates to that iron string. Accept the place the divine providence has found for you, the society of your contemporaries, the connection of events. Great men have always done so, and confided themselves childlike to the genius of their age, betraying their perception that the absolutely trustworthy was seated at their heart, working through their hands, predominating in all their being. And we are now men, and must accept in the highest mind the same transcendent destiny; and not minors and invalids in a protected corner, not cowards fleeing before a revolution, but guides, redeemers, and benefactors, obeying the Almighty effort, and advancing on Chaos and the Dark.","Atom from atom yawns as far As moon from earth, or star from star.","why should we grope among the dry bones of the past, or put the living generation into masquerade out of its faded wardrobe? The sun shines to-day also. There","I am God in nature;I am a weed by the wall.","Every spirit builds itself a house; and beyond its house a world; and beyond its world, a heaven. Know then, that the world exists for you. For you is the phenomenon perfect. What we are, that only can we see. All that Adam had, all that Caesar could, you have and can do. Adam called his house, heaven and earth; Caesar called his house, Rome; you perhaps call yours, a cobler\'s trade; a hundred acres of ploughed land; or a scholar\'s garret. Yet line for line and point for point, your dominion is as great as theirs, though without fine names. Build, therefore, your own world. As fast as you conform your life to the pure idea in your mind, that will unfold its great proportions.","The Sphinx must solve her own riddle.","There is no great and no smallTo the Soul that maketh all:And where it cometh, all things areAnd it cometh everywhere.","For nonconformity the world whips you with its displeasure.","Put any company of people together with freedom for conversation, and a rapid self-distribution takes place into sets and pairs. The best are accused of exclusiveness. It would be more true to say they separate as oil from water, as children from old people, without love or hatred in the matter, each seeking his like; and any interference with the affinities would produce constraint and suffocation. All conversation is a magnetic experiment, I know that my friend can talk eloquently; you know that he cannot articulate a sentence: we have seen him in different company.","It is remarkable, the character of the pleasure we derive from the best books.","FOR EVERY STOIC WAS A STOIC BUT WHERE IN CHRISTENDOM IS THE CHRISTIAN?","Each man takes care that his neighbor shall not cheat him. But a day comes when he begins to care that he does not cheat his neighbor. Then all goes well - he has changed his market-cart into a chariot of the sun.","There is no one who does not exaggerate. In conversation, men are encumbered with personality, and talk to much.","They measure their esteem of each other by what each has, and not by what each is. But a cultivated man becomes ashamed of his property, out of new respect for his nature.","One of the illusions of life is that the present hour is not the critical decisive hour. Write it on your heart that every day is the best day of the year.","One man thinks justice consists in paying debts, and has no measure in his abhorrence of another who is very remiss in this duty and makes the creditor wait tediously. But that second man has his own way of looking at things; asks himself Which debt must I pay first, the debt to the rich, or the debt to the poor? the debt of money or the debt of thought to mankind, of genius to nature? For you, O broker, there is not other principle but arithmetic. For me, commerce is of trivial import; love, faith, truth of character, the aspiration of man, these are sacred;","The skill to do comes of doing.","It is the secret of the world that all things subsist and do not die, but retire a little from sight and afterwards return again.","A person seldom falls sick, but the bystanders are animated with a faint hope that he will die.","Life is an experiment. The more experiments the better","Men cease to interest us when we find their limitations.","Big jobs usually go to the men who prove their ability to outgrow small ones.","Napoleon said of Massena, that he was not himself until the battle began to go against him; then, when the dead began to fall in ranks around him, awoke his powers of combination, and he put on terror and victory as a robe. So it is in rugged crises, in unweariable endurance, and in aims which put sympathy out of question, that the angel is shown.","Nothing is quite beautiful alone: nothing but is beautiful in the whole. A single object is only so far beautiful as it suggests this universal grace. The poet, the painter, the sculptor, the musician, the architect, seek each to concentrate this radiance of the world on one point, and each in his several work to satisfy the love of beauty which stimulates him to produce. Thus is Art, a nature passed through the alembic of man. Thus in art, does nature work through the will of a man filled with the beauty of her first works.","Me too thy nobleness has taughtTo master my despair;The fountains of my hidden lifeAre through thy friendship fair.","OUR age is retrospective. It builds the sepulchres of the fathers. It writes biographies, histories, and criticism. The foregoing generations beheld God and nature face to face; we, through their eyes. Why should not we also enjoy an original relation to the universe? Why should not we have a poetry and philosophy of insight and not of tradition, and a religion by revelation to us, and not the history of theirs? Embosomed for a season in nature, whose floods of life stream around and through us, and invite us by the powers they supply, to action proportioned to nature, why should we grope among the dry bones of the past, or put the living generation into masquerade out of its faded wardrobe? The sun shines to-day also. There is more wool and flax in the fields. There are new lands, new men, new thoughts. Let us demand our own works and laws and worship.","Congratulate yourself if you have broken the monotony of a conventional age","The way to write is to throw your body at the mark when all your arrows are spent.","There are many eyes that can detect and honor the prudent and household virtues; there are many that can discern Genius on his starry track, though the mob is incapable; but when that love which is all-suffering, all-abstaining, all-aspiring, which has vowed to itself, that it will be a wretch and also a fool in this world, sooner than soil its white hands by any compliances, comes into our streets and houses, --only the pure and aspiring can know its face, and the only compliment they can pay it, is to own it.","When they are real, they are not glass threads or frostwork, but the solidest thing we know.","Nothing divine dies. All good is eternally reproductive. The beauty of nature reforms itself in the mind, and not for barren contemplation, but for new creation.","He has not learned the lesson of life who does not every day surmount a fear.","O, believe, as thou livest, that every sound that is spoken over the round world, which thou oughtest to hear, will vibrate on thine ear!","Every man has a history worth knowing, if he could tell it, or if we could draw it from him.","The glory of friendship is not the outstretched hand, nor the kindly smile, nor the joy of companionship; it\'s the spiritual inspiration that comes to one when he discovers that someone else believes in him and is willing to trust him with his friendship.","The love that you withhold is the pain you carry.","Our chief want in life is somebody who shall make us do what we can.","Thus to him, to this school-boy under the bending dome of day, is suggested, that he and it proceed from one root; one is leaf and one is flower; relation, sympathy, stirring in every vein. And what is that Root? Is not that the soul of his soul?\u2015A thought too bold,\u2015a dream too wild. Yet when this spiritual light shall have revealed the law of more earthly natures,\u2015when he has learned to worship the soul, and to see that the natural philosophy that now is, is only the first gropings of its gigantic hand, he shall look forward to an ever expanding knowledge as to a becoming creator. He shall see, that nature is the opposite of the soul, answering to it part for part. One is seal, and one is print. Its beauty is the beauty of his own mind. Its laws are the laws of his own mind. Nature then becomes to him the measure of his attainments. So much of nature as he is ignorant of, so much of his own mind does he not yet possess. And, in fine, the ancient precept, \\"Know thyself,\\" and the modern precept, \\"Study nature,\\" become at last one maxim.","To be your self in a world that is constantly trying to make you something else is the greatest accomplishment","Then [good manners] must be inspired by the good heart. There is no beautifier of complexion, or form, or behavior, like the wish to scatter joy and not pain around us.","What lies behind you and what lies infront of you, pales in comparison to what lies inside of you.","I am the lover of uncontained and immortal beauty.","What is it we heartily wish of each other? Is it to be pleased and flattered? No, but to be convicted and exposed, to be shamed out of our nonsense of all kinds, and made men of, instead of ghosts and phantoms. We are weary of gliding ghostlike through the world, which is itself so slight and unreal. We crave a sense of reality, though it comes in strokes of pain.","The ancient precept, \u201cKnow thyself, and the modern precept, \u201cStudy nature,\u201d become at last one maxim.\u201d","How cunningly nature hides every wrinkle of her inconceivable antiquity under roses and violets and monring dew","I am not solitary whilst I read and write, though nobody is with me.

We come to wear one cut of face and figure, and acquire by degrees the gentlest asinine expression.","The purpose of life seems to be to acquaint a man with himself and whatever science or art or course of action he engages in reacts upon and illuminates the recesses of his own mind. Thus friends seem to be only mirrors to draw out and explain to us ourselves; and that which draws us nearer our fellow man, is, that the deep Heart in one, answers the deep Heart in another, -- that we find we have (a common Nature) -- one life which runs through all individuals, and which is indeed Divine.","Man is physically as well as metaphysically a thing of shreds and patches, borrowed unequally from good and bad ancestors, and a misfit from the start.","He who knows that power is inborn, that he is weak because he has looked for good out of him and elsewhere, and so perceiving, throws himself unhesitatingly on his thought, instantly rights himself, stands in the erect position, commands his limbs, works miracles; just as a man who stands on his feet is stronger than a man who stands on his head.","Speak what you think now in hard words and tomorrow speak what tomorrow thinks in hard words again, though it contradicts everything you said today.","There is no object so foul that intense light will not make beautiful.","We will meet as though we met not and part as though we parted not.","Every spirit builds itself a house; and beyond its house a world; and beyond its world, a heaven.","Every thing looks permanent until its secret is known.","A man must consider what rich realms he abdicates when he becomes a conformist","This love of beauty is Taste. Others have the same love in such excess, that, not content with admiring, they seek to embody it in new forms. The creation of beauty is art.","Our acts our angels are, or good or ill, Our fatal shadows that walk by us still.","The first and last lesson of religion is, \'The things that are seen are temporal; the things that are not seen are eternal.\' It puts an affront upon nature.","Good thoughts are no better than good dreams, unless they be executed.","I remember an answer which when quite young I was prompted to make to a valued adviser who was wont to importune me with the dear old doctrines of the church. On my saying, What have I to do with the sacredness of traditions, if I live wholly from within? my friend suggested--\'But these impulses may be from below, not from above.\' I replied, \'They do not seem to me to be such; but if I am the devil\'s child, I will live them from the devil.","We are born believing. A man bears belief, as a tree bears apples.","To Laugh Often & to Love much","We are taught by great actions that the universe is the property of every individual in it. Every rational creature has all nature for his dowry and estate. It is his, if he will. He may divest himself of it; he may creep into a corner, and abdicate his kingdom, as most men do, but he is entitled to the world by his constitution.","I trust a good deal to common fame, as we all must. If a man has good corn, or wood, or boards, or pigs, to sell, or can make better chairs or knives, crucibles or church organs, than anybody else, you will find a broad hard-beaten road to his house, though it be in the woods.","No truth so sublime but it may be trivial to-morrow in the light of new thoughts. People wish to be settled: only as far as they are unsettled is there any hope for them.","The foremost watchman on the peak announces his news. It is the truest word ever spoken, and the phrase will be th fittest, most musical, and the unerring voice of the world for that time.","Genius is the activity which repairs the decay of things.","Our life is March weather, savage and serene in one hour.","In God, every end is converted into a new means. Thus the use of commodity, regarded by itself, is mean and squalid.","What is the scholar, what is the man for, but for hospitality to every new thought of his time? Have you leisure, power, property, friends? you shall be the asylum and patron of every new thought, every unproven opinion, every untried project, which proceeds out of good will and honest seeking. All the newspapers, all the tongues of to-day will of course at first defame what is noble; but you who hold not of to-day, not of the times, but of the Everlasting, are to stand for it: and the highest compliment, man ever receives from heaven, is the sending to him its disguised and discredited angels.","the whole of nature is a metaphor of the human mind. The","It is the best of humanity, I think, that goes out to walk. In happy hours all affairs may be wisely postponed for this. Dr. Johnson said, \u2018Few men know how to take a walk,\u2019 and it is pretty certain that Dr. Johnson was not one of those few. It is a fine art; there are degrees of proficiency, and we distinguish the professors from the apprentices. The qualifications are endurance, plain clothes, old shoes, an eye for nature, good-humor, vast curiosity, good speech, good silence, and nothing too much. Good observers have the manners of trees and animals, and if they add words, it is only when words are better than silence. But a vain talker profanes the river and the forest, and is nothing like so good company as a dog.","You can never do a kindness too soon, for you never know how soon it will be too late.","For flowers that bloom about our feet;For tender grass, so fresh, so sweet;For song of bird, and hum of bee;For all things fair we hear or see,Father in heaven, we thank Thee!","We see the world piece by piece, as the sun, the moon, the animal, the tree; but the whole, of which these are shining parts, is the soul","My country is the world and my religion is to do good.","To describe adequately is the high power & one of the highest enjoyments of man.She was beautiful and he fell in love with her. The thing has happened to millions, yet how few can tell the story. Try some of them, set them at the painting; each knows it all & can communicate nothing. Then comes Shakspeare [sic], & tells it point for point as it befel [sic], or better; and now we have two things, love & literature.","All things are engaged in writing their history...Not a foot steps into the snow, or along the ground, but prints in characters more or less lasting, a map of its march. The ground is all memoranda and signatures; and every object covered over with hints. In nature, this self-registration is incessant, and the narrative is the print of the seal.","There is a difference between truly listening and waiting for your turn to talk.","This relation between the mind and matter is not fancied by some poet, but stands in the will of God, and so is free to be known by all men.","What lies behind us and what lies before us are small matters compared to what lies within us.","I hate quotations.

It","Of the works of this mind history is the record. Its genius is illustrated by the entire series of days. Man is explicable by nothing less than all his history. Without hurry, without rest, the human spirit goes forth from the beginning to embody every faculty, every thought, every emotion, which belongs to it, in appropriate events. But the thought is always prior to the fact; all the facts of history preexist in the mind as laws. Each law in turn is made by circumstances predominant, and the limits of nature give power to but one at a time. A man is the whole encyclopaedia of facts. The creation of a thousand forests is in one acorn, and Egypt, Greece, Rome, Gaul, Britain, America, lie folded already in the first man. Epoch after epoch, camp, kingdom, empire, republic, democracy, are merely the application of his manifold spirit to the manifold world.","To laugh often and much;to win the respect of intelligent people and the affection of children;to earn the appreciation of honest critics;and to endure the betrayal of false friends.To appreciate beauty;to find the best in others;to leave the world a bit better whether by a healthy child, a garden patch, or a redeemed social condition;to know that even one life has breathed easier because you have lived.This is to have succeeded.","The power which resides in him is new in nature, and none but he knows what that is which can do, nor does he know until he has tried.","The intellectual life may be kept clean and healthful if man will live the life of nature and not import into his mind difficulties which are none of his. No man need be perplexed in his speculations.Not less conspicuous is the preponderance of nature over will in all practical life. There is less intention in history than we ascribe to it. We impute deep-laid far-sighted plans to C\xe6sar and Napoleon; but the best of their power was in nature, not in them. Our life might be much easier and simpler than we make it; that the world might be a happier place than it is; that there is no need of struggle, convulsions, and despairs, of the wringing of the hands and the gnashing of the teeth; that we miscreate our own evil. A little consideration of what takes place around us every day would show us that a higher law than that of our will regulates events; that our painful labors are unnecessary and fruitless; that only in our easy, simple, spontaneous action are we strong, and by contenting ourselves with obedience we become divine.No man can learn what he has not preparation for learning, however near to his eyes is the object.Not in nature but in man is all the beauty and worth he sees. The world is very empty, and is indebted to this gilding, exalting soul for all its pride.He may see what he maketh. Our dreams are the sequel of our waking knowledge. The visions of the night bear some proportion to the visions of the day. Hideous dreams are exaggerations of the sins of the day. We see our evil affections embodied in bad physiognomies.The same reality pervades all teaching. The man may teach by doing, and not otherwise. If he can communicate himself he can teach, but not you words. He teaches who gives, and he learns who receives. There is no teaching until the pupil is brought into the same state or principle in which you are; a transfusion takes place; he is you and you are he; then is a teaching, and by no unfriendly chance or bad company can he never quite lose the benefit. The effect of every action is measured by the depth of the sentiment from which it proceeds. The great man knew not that he was great. It look a century or two for that fact to appear. What he did, he did because he must; it was the most natural thing in the world, and grew out of the circumstances of the moment. But now, every thing he did, even to the lifting of his finger or the eating of bread, looks large, all-related, and is called an institution.We are full of these superstitions of sense, the worship of magnitude. We call the poet inactive, because he is not a president, a merchant, or a porter. We adore an institution, and do not see that it is founded on a thought which we have. But real action is in silent moments. The epochs of our life are not in the visible facts of our choice of a calling, our marriage, our acquisition of an office, and the like, but in a silent thought by the wayside as we walk; in a thought which revises our entire manner of life and says,\u2014\u2018Thus hast thou done, but it were better thus.","alone and unacknowledged. They nod to me, and I to them. The waving of the boughs in the storm, is new to me and old. It takes me by surprise, and yet is not unknown. Its effect is like that of a higher thought or a better emotion coming over me, when I deemed I was thinking justly or doing right. Yet it is certain that the power to produce this delight, does not reside in nature, but in man, or in a harmony of both. It is necessary to use these pleasures with great temperance. For, nature is not always tricked in holiday attire, but the same scene which yesterday","The alleged power to charm down insanity, or ferocity in beasts, is a power behind the eye.","Life lies behind us as the quarry from whence we get tiles and copestones for the masonry of to-day.","Rectitude is a perpetual victory, celebrated not by cries of joy but by serenity, which is joy fixed or habitual.","The world thus exists to the soul to satisfy the desire of beauty.

The reliance on authority measures the decline of religion, the withdrawal of the soul. The position men have given to Jesus, now for many centuries of history, is a position of authority. It characterizes themselves.","Genius is religious.","We do not believe our own thought; we must serve somebody; we must quote somebody; we dote on the old and the distant; we are tickled by great names; we import the religion of other nations; we quote their opinions; we cite their laws.","What lies behind us and what lies before us are nothing compared to what lies within us.","In the woods, we return to reason and faith. There I feel that nothing can befall me in life, \u2014 no disgrace, no calamity, (leaving me my eyes,) which nature cannot repair.","What\'s a book? Everything or nothing. The eye that sees it all.","A fever, a mutilation, a cruel disappointment, a loss of wealth, a loss of friends, seems at the moment unpaid loss, and unpayable. But the sure years reveal the deep remedial force that underlies all facts. The death of a dear friend, wife, brother, lover, which seemed nothing but privation, somewhat later assumes the aspect of a guide or genius; for it commonly operates revolutions in our way of life, terminates an epoch of infancy or of youth which was waiting to be closed, breaks up a wonted occupation, or a household, or style of living, and allows the formation of new ones more friendly to the growth of character.","It is said to be the age of the first person singular","Nature hates monopolies and exceptions. The waves of the sea do not more speedily seek a level from their loftiest tossing, than the varieties of condition tend to equalize themselves. There is always some leveling circumstance that puts down the overbearing, the strong, the rich, the fortunate, substantially on the same ground with all others","There are all degrees of proficiency in the use men make of this instructive world where we are boarded and schooled and apprenticed. It is sufficient to our present purpose to indicate three degrees of progress.One class lives to the utility of the symbol, as the majority of men do, regarding health and wealth as the chief good. Another class live about this mark to the beauty of the symbol; as the poet and artist and the sensual school in philosophy. A third class live above the beauty of the symbol to the beauty of the thing signified and these are wise men. The first class have common sense; the second, taste; and the third spiritual perception.I see in society the neophytes of all these classes, the class especially of young men who in their best knowledge of the sign have a misgiving that there is yet an unattained substance and they grope and sigh and aspire long in dissatisfaction, the sand-blind adorers of the symbol meantime chirping and scoffing and trampling them down. I see moreover that the perfect man - one to a millennium - if so many, traverses the whole scale and sees and enjoys the symbol solidly; then also has a clear eye for its beauty; and lastly wears it lightly as a robe which he can easily throw off, for he sees the reality and divine splendor of the inmost nature bursting through each chink and cranny.","How does Nature deify us with a few and cheap elements! Give me health and a day, and I will make the pomp of emperors ridiculous.","Montaigne says, \u201cBooks are a languid pleasure, but I find certain books vital and spermatic, not leaving the reader what he was; he shuts the book a richer man. I would never willingly read any other than such.\u201d","thought can never ripen into truth.","We must be as courteous to a man as we are to a picture, which we are willing to give the advantage of a good light.","The health of the eye seems to demand a horizon. We are never tired, so long as we can see far enough","Truth, and goodness, and beauty, are but different faces of the same All.","For every grain of wit, there is a grain of folly. For everything you have missed, you have gained something else; and for everything you gain, you lose something","We but half express ourselves, [155] and are ashamed of that divine idea which each of us represents.","Jangan sia-siakan waktu anda untuk ragu-ragu dan takut.Laksanakanlah pekerjaan yang ada di depan mata, sebab tugas asaat ini yang dilaksanakan dengan sebaik-baiknya akan menjadi persiapan terbaik untuk masa-masa yang akan datang.","In inquiries respecting the laws of the world and the frame of things, the highest reason is always the truest.","Laugh as much as you breathe and love as long as you live","The populace think that your rejection of popular standards is a rejection of all standard, and mere antinomianism; and the bold sensualist will use the name of philosophy to gild his crimes. But the law of consciousness abides.","We spend our incomes for paint and paper, for a hundred trifles, I know not what, and not for the things of a man. Our expense is almost all for conformity. It is for cake that we run in debt; \'t is not the intellect, not the heart, not beauty, not worship, that costs so much. Why needs any man be rich? Why must he have horses, fine garments, handsome apartments, access to public houses, and places of amusement? Only for want of thought.","Shallow men believe in luck...Strong men believe in cause and effect","A nation, like a tree, does not thrive well till it is engrafted with a foreign stock.","In every work of genius we recognize our own rejected thoughts.","The poet discovers that what men value as substances have a higher value as symbols; that Nature is the immense shadow of man. A man\'s action is only a picture-book of his creed. He does after what he believes. Your condition, your employment, is the fable of you. The world is thoroughly anthropomorphized, as if it had passed through the body and mind of man, and taken his mould and form. Indeed, good poetry is always personification, and heightens every species of force in nature by giving it a human volition. We are advertised that there is nothing to which man is not related; that everything is convertible into every other. The staff in his hand is the radius vector of the sun. The chemistry of this is the chemistry of that. Whatever one act we do, whatever one thing we learn, we are doing and learning all things,\u2014marching in the direction of universal power. Every healthy mind is a true Alexander or Sesostris, building a universal monarchy.","We are what we think about all day long.","For all symbols are fluxional; all language is vehicular and transitive, and is good, as ferries and houses are, for conveyance, not as farms and houses are, for homestead.","Nature will be reported. All things are engaged in writing their history. The planet, the pebble, goes attended by its shadow. The rolling rock leaves its scratches on the mountain; the river, its channel in the soil; the animal, its bones in the stratum; the fern and leaf their modest epitaph in the coal.","The world\u2014this shadow of the soul, or other me, lies wide around. Its attractions are the keys which unlock my thoughts and make me acquainted with myself. I launch eagerly into this resounding tumult. I grasp the hands of those next me, and take my place in the ring to suffer and to work, taught by an instinct that so shall the dumb abyss[43] be vocal with speech. I pierce its order; I dissipate its fear;[44] I dispose of it within the circuit of my expanding life. So much only of life as I know by experience, so much of the wilderness have I vanquished and planted, or so far have I extended my being, my dominion. I do not see how any man can afford, for the sake of his nerves and his nap, to spare any action in which he can partake. It is pearls and rubies to his discourse. Drudgery, calamity, exasperation, want, are instructors in eloquence and wisdom. The true scholar grudges every opportunity of action passed by, as a loss of power.","Most of the shadows of this life are caused by standing in our own sunshine.","A world in the hand is worth two in the bush.","It is better to hear than to speak.","What I must do is all that concerns me, not what the people think. This rule, equally arduous in actual and in intellectual life, may serve for the whole distinction between greatness and meanness. It is the harder, because you will always find those who think they know what is your duty better than you know it. It is easy in the world to live after the world\u2019s opinion; it is easy in solitude to live after our own; but the great man is he who in the midst of the crowd keeps with perfect sweetness the independence of solitude.","It facilitates labor and thought so much that there is always the temptation in large schools to omit the endless task of\\tmeeting the wants of each single mind, and to govern by steam. But it is at frightful cost. Our modes of Education aim to expedite, to save labor; to do for masses what cannot be done for masses, what must be done reverently, one by one: say rather, the whole world is needed for the tuition of each pupil.","If a man is at once acquainted with the geometric foundation of things and with their festal splendor, his poetry is exact and his arithmetic musical.","understand her text. By degrees we may come to know the primitive sense of the permanent objects of nature, so that the world shall be to us","The world -- this shadow of the soul, or other me, lies wide around. Its attractions are the keys which unlock my thoughts and make me acquainted with myself. I run eagerly into this resounding tumult...So much only of life as I know by experience...The true scholar grudges every opportunity of action past by, as a loss of power.","Every production of genius must be the production of enthusiasm...Nothing great was ever achieved without enthusiasm.","Turn the eye upside down, by looking at the landscape through your legs, and how agreeable is the picture, though you have seen it any time these twenty years!","It is not often the worst trait that occasions the loudest outcry. Men complain of their suffering and not of the crime.","We are like travelers using the cinders of a volcano to roast their eggs.","We must be our own before we can be another\'s","Every man supposes himself not to be fully understood; and if there is any truth in him ... I see not how it can be otherwise.","When the mind is braced by labor and invention, the page of whatever book we read becomes luminous with manifold allusion. Every sentence is doubly significant, and the sense of our author is as broad as the world.","If there is any period one would desire to be born in, \u23af is it not the age of Revolution; whenthe old and the new stand side by side, and admit of being compared; when the energies of all men are searched by fear and by hope; when the historic glories of the old, can be compensated by the rich possibilities of the new era? This time, like all times, is a very good one, if we but know what to do with it.","The world of any moment is the merest appearance. Some great decorum, some fetish of government, some ephemeral trade, or war, or man, is cried up by half mankind and cried down by the other half, as if it all depended on this particular up or down.","Let a Stoic open the resources of man, and tell men they are not leaning willows, but can and must detach themselves; that with the exercise of self-trust, new powers shall appear; that a man is the word made flesh, born to shed healing to the nations, that he should be ashamed of our compassion, and that the moment he acts from himself, tossing the laws, the books, idolatries, and customs out of the window, we pity him no more, but thank and revere him, \u2014 and that teacher shall restore the life of man to splendor, and make his name dear to all history.","The god of the cannibals will be a cannibal, of the crusaders a crusader, and of the merchants a merchant.","Der beste Weg, einen Freund zu haben, ist der, selbst einer zu sein.","Does not\u2026 the ear of Handel predict the witchcraft of harmonic sound?","Other world! There is no other world! Here or nowhere is the whole fact.","The point of imperfection which we occupy -- is it on the way up or down?","Man is explicable by nothing less than all his history.","God will not have his work made manifest by cowards. A man is relieved and gay when he has put his heart into his work and done his best; but what he has said or done otherwise shall give him no peace.","See how the masses of men worry themselves into nameless graves, while here and there a great unselfish soul forgets himself into immortality.","good writing and brilliant discourse are perpetual allegories.

They impress us with the conviction, that one nature wrote and the same reads.","Every revolution was first a thought in one man\u2019s mind, and when the same thought occurs to another man, it is the key to that era. Every reform was once a private opinion, and when it shall be a private opinion again, it will solve the problem of the age. The fact narrated must correspond to something in me to be credible or intelligible. We as we read must become Greeks, Romans, Turks, priest and king, martyr and executioner, must fasten these images to some reality in our secret experience, or we shall learn nothing rightly.","This surface on which we now stand is not fixed, but sliding.","It is better to be the thorn in the side of your friend than his echo","The energy of the mind is commensurate with the work to be done.","The man is only a half himself, the other half is his expression","Wherever a man comes, there comes a revolution.

Many men are as tender and irritable as lovers in reference to these predilections. Indeed, a man\'s library is a sort of harem, and I observe that tender readers have a great pudency in showing their books to a stranger.","He who is not every day conquering some fear has not learned the secret of life.","Why all this deference to Alfred, and Scanderbeg, and Gustavus? Suppose they were virtuous; did they wear out virtue?","the poor man, whom the law does not allow to take an ear of corn when starving, nor a pair of shoes for his freezing feet, is allowed to put his hand into the pocket of the rich, and say, You shall educate me, not as you will, but as I will...","power ceases in the instant of repose, it resides in the moment of transition","We do not know today whether we are busy or idle. In times when we thought ourselves indolent we have discovered afterward that much was accomplished and much was begun in us.","What\u2019s the use of an admirable form of government if political parties and moneyed interests control it? What\u2019s the use of our judicial system, if judges only quote precedents and ignore first principles? What\u2019s the use of a Supreme Court if it\u2019s swayed by the political winds of the hour?","An idea lights a thousand candles.","we are what we know.","For of one will, the actions will be harmonious, however unlike they seem. These varieties are lost sight of at a little distance, at a little height of thought. One tendency unites them all. The voyage of the best ship is a zigzag line of a hundred tacks. See the line from a sufficient distance, and it straightens itself to the average tendency. Your genuine action will explain itself, and will explain your other genuine actions. Your conformity explains nothing. Act singly, and what you have already done singly will justify you now.","Every man is an impossibility until he is born; every thing impossible until we see a success.","Life lies behind us as the quarry from whence we get tiles and copestones for the masonry of to-day. This is the way to learn grammar.

I, too late,Under her solemn fillet saw the scorn.","What a signal convenience is fame. Do we read all authors to grope our way to the best? No, but the world selects for us the best, and we select from these our best.","Life is comic or pitiful as soon as the high ends of being fade out of sight, and man becomes near-sighted, and can only attend to what addresses the senses.","We see the world piece by piece, as the sun, the moon, the animal, the tree; but the whole, of which these are the shining parts, is the soul.","Everybody we know surrounds himself with a fine house, fine books, conservatory, gardens, equipage, and all manner of toys, as screens to interpose between himself and his guest. Does it not seem as if man was of a very sly, elusive nature, and dreaded nothing so much as a full rencontre front to front with his fellow?","Society we must have; but let it be society, and not exchanging news or eating from the same dish. Is it society to sit in one of your chairs? I cannot go to the houses of my nearest relatives, because I do not wish to be alone. Society exists by chemical affinity, and not otherwise.","Ser voc\xea mesmo em um mundo que est\xe1 constantemente tentando fazer de voc\xea outra coisa \xe9 a maior realiza\xe7\xe3o.","I find that whatever is old corrupts, and the past turns to snakes. The reverence for the deeds of our ancestors is a treacherous sentiment.

Philosophy is the account which the human mind gives to itself of the constitution of the world. Two cardinal facts lie forever at the base; the one, and the two.\u20141. Unity, or Identity; and, 2. Variety. We unite all things by perceiving the law which pervades them; by perceiving the superficial differences and the profound resemblances. But every mental act,\u2014this very perception of identity or oneness, recognizes the difference of things. Oneness and otherness.

That divided and rebel mind, that distrust of a sentiment because our arithmetic has computed the strength and means opposed to our purpose, these have not. Their mind being whole, their eye is as yet unconquered, and when we look in their faces, we are disconcerted. Infancy conforms to nobody: all conform to it, so that one babe commonly makes four or five out of the adults who prattle and play to it. So God has armed youth and puberty and manhood no less with its own piquancy and charm, and made it enviable and gracious and its claims not to be put by, if it will stand by itself. Do not think the youth has no force, because he cannot speak to you and me.","Power is, in nature, the essential measure of right. Nature suffers nothing to remain in her kingdoms which cannot help itself. The genesis and maturation of a planet, its poise and orbit, the bended tree recovering itself from the strong wind, the vital resources of every animal and vegetable, are demonstrations of the self-sufficing and therefore self-relying soul.","If the red slayer think he slays,Or if the slain think he is slain,They know not well the subtle waysI keep, and pass, and turn again.Far or forgot to me is near,Shadow and sunlight are the same,The vanished gods to me appear,And one to me are shame and fame.They reckon ill who leave me out;When me they fly, I am the wings;I am the doubter and the doubt,And I the hymn the Brahmin sings.The strong gods pine for my abode,And pine in vain the sacred Seven;But thou, meek lover of the good!Find me, and turn thy back on heaven.","The greatest delight which the fields and woods minister is the suggestion of an occult relation between man and the vegetable. I am not alone and unacknowledged. They nod to me, and I to them. The waving of the boughs in the storm is new to me and old. It takes me by surprise, and yet is not unknown. Its effect is like that of a higher thought or a better emotion coming over me, when I deemed I was thinking justly or doing right.","A boy is in the parlour what the pit is in the playhouse; independent, irresponsible, looking out from his corner on such people and facts as pass by, he tries and sentences them on their merits, in the swift, summary way of boys, as good, bad, interesting, silly, eloquent, troublesome. He cumbers himself never about consequences, about interests: he gives an independent, genuine verdict. You must court him: he does not court you. But the man is, as it were, clapped into jail by his consciousness. As soon as he has once acted or spoken with eclat, he is a committed person, watched by the sympathy or the hatred of hundreds, whose affections must now enter into his account. There is no Lethe for this. Ah, that he could pass again into his neutrality!

Accept the place the divine providence has found for you, the society of your contemporaries, the connection of events. Great men have always done so, and confided themselves childlike to the genius of their age, betraying their perception that the absolutely trustworthy was seated at their heart, working through their hands, predominating in all their being. And we are now men, and must accept in the highest mind the same transcendent destiny; and not minors and invalids in a protected corner, not cowards fleeing before a revolution, but guides, redeemers, and benefactors, obeying the Almighty effort, and advancing on Chaos [157] and the Dark. What","The world laughs in flowers.","A subtle chain of countless rings The next unto the farthest brings; The eye reads omens where it goes, And speaks all languages the rose; And, striving to be man, the worm Mounts through all the spires of form.","Over the inter glaciers,I see the summer glow,And, through the wild-piled snowdrift,The warm rosebuds below.","Never lose an opportunity of seeing anything that is beautiful; for beauty is God\u2019s handwriting \u2014 a wayside sacrament.

Here is the fountain of action and of thought... We lie in the lap of immense intelligence.","Empirical science is apt to cloud the sight, and by the very knowledge of functions and processes to bereave the student of the manly contemplation of the whole. The savant becomes unpoetic.","Better that the book should be not quite so good, and the writer better, and not himself a ridiculous contrast to all he has written.","What angels invented these splendid ornaments, these rich conveniences, this ocean of air above, this ocean of water beneath, this firmament of earth between? this zodiac of lights, this tent of dropping clouds, this striped coat of climates, this fourfold year? Beasts, fire, water, stones, and corn serve him. The field is at once his floor, his work-yard, his play-ground, his garden, and his bed","Society is a wave. The wave moves onward, but the water of which it is composed does not. The same particle does not rise from the valley to the ridge. Its unity is only phenomenal. The persons who make up a nation to-day, next year die, and their experience with them.","The other terror that scares us from self-trust is our consistency; a reverence for our past act or word, because the eyes of others have no other data for computing our orbit than our past acts, and we are loath to disappoint them.But why should you keep your head over your shoulder? Why drag about this corpse of your memory, lest you contradict somewhat you have stated in this or that public place? Suppose you should contradict yourself; what then?","The stars have us to bed: Night draws the curtain; which the sun withdraws.

It is not enough that we should have matter, we must also have a single impulse, one shove to launch the mass and generate the harmony of the centrifugal and centripetal forces.\u2019 ... There is no end to the consequences of the act. That famous aboriginal push propagates itself through all the balls of the system, and through every atom of every ball.","But the best conversation is rare. Society seems to have agreed to treat fictions as realities, and realities as fictions; and the simple lover of truth, especially if on very high grounds, as a religious or intellectual seeker, finds himself a stranger and alien.","It is not length of life, but depth of life","Each is liable to panic, which is, exactly, the terror of ignorance surrendered to the imagination.","moss; A bird in the hand is worth two in the bush; A cripple in the right way, will beat a racer in the wrong; Make hay while the sun shines; \'T is hard to carry","True courage is not ostentatious; men who wish to inspire terror seem thereby to confess themselves cowards.

Throw a stone into the stream, and the circles that propagatethemselves are the beautiful type of all influence. Man is conscious of auniversal soul within or behind his individual life, wherein, as in a firmament,the natures of Justice, Truth, Love, Freedom, arise and shine. This universalsoul, he calls Reason: it is not mine, or thine, or his, but we are its; we areits property and men. And the blue sky in which the private earth is buried, thesky with its eternal calm, and full of everlasting orbs, is the type of Reason.That which, intellectually considered, we call Reason, considered in relation tonature, we call Spirit. Spirit is the Creator. Spirit hath life in itself. Andman in all ages and countries, embodies it in his language, as the FATHER.","The action of the soul is oftener in that which is felt and left unsaid than in that which is said in any conversation. It broods over every society, and they unconsciously seek for it in each other. We know better than we do. We do not yet possess ourselves, and we know at the same time that we are much more. I feel the same truth how often in my trivial conversation with my neighbors, that somewhat higher in each of us overlooks this by-play, and Jove nods to Jove from behind each of us.","Every word which is used to express a moral or intellectual fact, if traced to its root, is found to be borrowed from some material appearance. Right means straight; wrong means twisted. Spirit primarily means wind; transgression, the crossing of a line; supercilious, the raising of the eyebrow. We say the heart to express emotion, the head to denote thought; and thought and emotion are words borrowed from sensible things, and now appropriated to spiritual nature. Most","The virtue in most request is conformity. Self-reliance is its aversion. It loves notrealities and creators, but names and customs.","Why should I keep holiday / When other men have none? / Why but because, when these are gay, / I sit and mourn alone? / And why, when mirth unseals all tongues, / Should mine alone be dumb? / Ah! late I spoke to silent throngs, / And now their hour is come.","Trust thyself: every heart vibrates to that iron string. Accept the place the divine providence has found for you, the society of your contemporaries, the connection of events.","Nature enhances her beauty, to the eye of loving men, from their belief that the poet is beholding her shows at the same time. He is isolated among his contemporaries by truth and by his art, but with this consolation in his pursuits, that they will draw all men sooner or later. For all men live by truth and stand in need of expression. In love, in art, in avarice, in politics, in labor, in games, we study to utter our painful secret. The man is only half himself, the other half is his expression.","The next great influence into the spirit of the scholar, is, the mind of the Past, \u2014 in whatever form, whether of literature, of art, of institutions, that mind is inscribed. Books are the best type of the influence of the past, and perhaps we shall get at the truth, \u2014 learn the amount of this influence more conveniently, \u2014 by considering their value alone.","The soul environs itself with friends, that it may enter into a grander self-acquaintance or solitude; and it goes alone for a season, that it may exalt its conversation or society.","shallow men believe in luck, strong men believe in cause and effect","Books are the best of things, well used; abused, among the worst.","By virtue of this inevitable nature, private will is overpowered, and, maugre our efforts or our imperfections, your genius will speak from you, and mine from me. That which we are, we shall teach, not voluntarily but involuntarily. Thoughts come into our minds by avenues which we never left open, and thoughts go out of our minds through avenues which we never voluntarily opened. Character teaches over our head. The infallible index of true progress is found in the tone the man takes. Neither his age, nor his breeding, nor company, nor books, nor actions, nor talents, nor all together can hinder him from being deferential to a higher spirit than his own. If he have not found his home in God, his manners, his forms of speech, the turn of his sentences, the build, shall I say, of all his opinions will involuntarily confess it, let him brave it out how he will. If we have found his centre, the Deity will shine through him, through all the disguises of ignorance, of ungenial temperament, of unfavorable circumstance.","When I heard the Earth-song / I was no longer brave; / My avarice cooled / Like lust in the chill of the grave.","A sturdy lad from New Hampshire or Vermont, who in turn tries all the professions, who teams it, farms it, peddles, keeps a school, preaches, edits a newspaper, goes to Congress, buys a township, and so forth, in successive years, and always, like a cat, falls on his feet, is worth a hundred of these city dolls. He walks abreast with his days, and feels no shame in not \u201cstudying a profession, for he does not postpone his life, but lives already.\u201d","One of the illusions of life is that the present hour is not the critical, decisive hour. Write it on your heart that every day is the best day in the year.","Though we travel the world over to find the beautiful, we must carry it with us of we find it not.","The definition of success--To laugh much; to win respect of intelligent persons and the affections of children; to earn the approbation of honest critics and endure the betrayal of false friends; to appreciate beauty; to find the best in others; to give one\'s self; to leave the world a little better, whether by a healthy child, a garden patch, or a redeemed social condition.; to have played and laughed with enthusiasm, and sung with exultation; to know even one life has breathed easier because you have lived--this is to have succeeded.","Nothing can bring you peace but yourself","To leave the world a bit better, whether by a healthy child, a garden patch or a redeemed social condition; to know even one life has breathed easier because you have lived.

Why should one regret if the receiver is not equally generous? It never troubles the sun that some of his rays fall wide and vain into ungrateful space, and only a small part on the reflecting planet. Let your greatness educate the crude and cold companion. If he is unequal, he will presently pass away; but thou art enlarged by thy own shining.","\u010covek je ono \u0161to misli tokom \u010ditavog dana","laws of moral nature answer to those of matter as face","So when the soul of the poet has come to ripeness of thought, she detaches and sends away from it its poems or songs,\u2014a fearless, sleepless, deathless progeny, which is not exposed to the accidents of the weary kingdom of time: a fearless, vivacious offspring, clad with wings (such was the virtue of the soul out of which they came), which carry them fast and far, and infix them irrecoverably into the hearts of men. These wings are the beauty of the poet\'s soul.","I do not wish to treat friendships daintily, but with roughest courage. When they are real, they are not glass threads or frost-work, but the solidest thing we know.","Honor is venerable to us because it is no ephemera. It is always ancient virtue. We worship it to-day because it is not of to-day. We love it and pay it homage because it is not a trap for our love and homage, but is self-dependent, self-derived, and therefore of an old immaculate pedigree, even if shown in a young person.","Parts of speech are metaphors, because the whole of nature is a metaphor of the human mind.","for the universe becomes transparent, and the light of higher laws","Most of the shadows of life are caused by standing in our own sunshine.","Do not hire a man who does your work for money, but him who does it for love of it.","Do not think the youth has no force, because he cannot speak to you and me. Hark! in the next room his voice is sufficiently clear and emphatic. It seems he knows how to speak to his contemporaries. Bashful or bold then, he will know how to make us seniors very unnecessary.","What lies behind you and what lies in front of you, pales in comparison to what lies inside of you.Ralph Waldo Emerson","The stars awaken a certain reverence, because though always present, they are inaccessible; but all natural objects make a kindred impression, when the mind is open to their influence.","The end of friendship is a commerce the most strict and homely that can be joined; more strict than any of which we have experience. It is for aid and comfort through all the relations and passages of life and death. It is fit for serene days, and graceful gifts, and country rambles, but also for rough roads and hard fare, shipwreck, poverty, and persecution. It keeps company with the sallies of the wit and the trances of religion. We are to dignify to each other the daily needs and offices of man\'s life, and embellish it by courage, wisdom and unity.","Poetry is the perpetual endeavor to express the spirit of the thing, to pass the brute body and search the life and reason which causes it to exist;\u2014to see that the object is always flowing away, whilst the spirit or necessity which causes it subsists. Its essential mark is that it betrays in every word instant activity of mind, shown in new uses of every fact and image, in preternatural quickness or perception of relations. All its words are poems. It is a presence of mind that gives a miraculous command of all means of uttering the thought and feeling of the moment. The poet squanders on the hour an amount of life that would more than furnish the seventy years of the man that stands next him.","What attracts my attention shall have it, as I will go to the man who knocks at my door, whilst a thousand persons as worthy go by it, to whom I give no regard.","Trust thyself: every heart vibrates to that iron string","A man\u2019s power to connect his thought with its proper symbol, and so to utterit, depends on the simplicity of his character, that is, upon his love of truth,and his desire to communicate it without loss. The corruption of man is followedby the corruption of language. When simplicity of character and the sovereigntyof ideas is broken up by the prevalence of secondary desires, the desire ofriches, of pleasure, of power, and of praise, \u2014 and duplicity and falsehoodtake place of simplicity and truth, the power over nature as an interpreter ofthe will, is in a degree lost; new imagery ceases to be created, and old wordsare perverted to stand for things which are not; a paper currency is employed,when there is no bullion in the vaults. In due time, the fraud is manifest, andwords lose all power to stimulate the understanding or the affections. Hundredsof writers may be found in every long-civilized nation, who for a short timebelieve, and make others believe, that they see and utter truths, who do not ofthemselves clothe one thought in its natural garment, but who feed unconsciouslyon the language created by the primary writers of the country, those, namely,who hold primarily on nature.","I have forgotten the books I have read, and so I have the dinners I have eaten, but they both helped to make me.","What would be the use of immortality to a person who cannot use well a half an hour.","as there is no screen or ceiling between our heads and the infinite heavens, so is there no bar or wall in the soul where man, the effect, ceases, and God, the cause, begins. The walls are taken away. We lie open on one side to the deeps of spiritual nature, to the attributes of God. Justice we see and know, Love, Freedom, Power. These natures no man ever got above, but they tower over us, and most in the moment when our interests tempt us to wound them.","De multe ori, viitorul unui om a depins de lectura unei c\u0103r\u021bi.","The frost which kills the harvest of a year, saves the harvests of a century, by destroying the weevil or the locust. Wars, fires, plagues, break up immovable routine, clear the ground of rotten races and dens of distemper, and open a fair field to new men. There is a tendency in things to right themselves, and the war or revolution or bankruptcy that shatters a rotten system, allows things to take a new and natural order. The sharpest evils are bent into that periodicity which makes the errors of planets, and the fevers and distempers of men, self-limiting. Nature is upheld by antagonism. Passions, resistance, danger, are educators. We acquire the strength we have overcome. Without war, no soldier; without enemies, no hero.","As a society, we\u2019re losing our sense of Divine activity in the world. We no longer recognize the power of Spirit in nature, history, and our daily lives. This has a positive side: Most of us no longer live under the constant dread of God\u2019s wrath and judgment, which haunted our Puritan and Calvinist forbears. They believed the meaning of life was to suffer for others, and so they taught discipline, self-deprivation, and sorrow. While there was a certain majesty in their faith, it\u2019s rightfully fading away. What will replace the old-time religion? I say: Let us bask in the morning sun that rises from the East, and be children of the light. Let us worship the mighty, transcendent soul.","Whence is your power? From my nonconformity. I never listened to your people\u2019s law, or to what they call their gospel, and wasted my time.","If instead of a gem, or even a flower, we should cast the gift of a loving thought into the heart of a friend, that would be giving as the angels give.","That popular fable of the sot who was picked up dead drunk in the street, carried to the duke\'s house, washed and dressed and laid in the duke\'s bed, and, on his waking, treated with all obsequious ceremony like the duke, and assured that he had been insane, owes its popularity to the fact that it symbolizes so well the state of man, who is in the world a sort of sot, but now and then wakes up, exercises his reason and finds himself a true prince.","In the East, fames are won.In the west, deeds are done.","I remember an answer which when quite young I was prompted to make to a valued adviser, who was wont to importune me with the dear old doctrines of the church. On my saying, What have I to do with the sacredness of traditions, if I live wholly from within? my friend suggested: \\"But these impulses may be from below, not from above.\\" I replied: \\"They do not seem to me to be such; but if I am the Devil\'s child, I will live then from the Devil.","We are all wise. The difference between persons is not in wisdom but in art. I knew, in an academical club, a person who always deferred to me; who, seeing my whim for writing, fancied that my experiences had somewhat superior; whilst I saw that his experiences were as good as mine. Give them to me and I would make the same use of them.","In proportion to the energy of his thought and will, he takes up the world into himself.","You think me the child of my circumstances: I make my circumstance.","We want a ship in these billows we inhabit.","Poets are thus liberating gods.","brings domesticity and common sense, and that propriety which every man loves, directly into this hurly-burly, and makes every bully ashamed.","We must go alone.

No man has learned anything rightly until he knows that every day is Doomsday.","Is the acorn better than the oak which is its fulness and completion? Is the parent better than the child into whom he has cast his ripened being? Whence then this worship of the past? The centuries are conspirators against the sanity and authority of the soul. Time and space are but physiological colors which the eye makes, but the soul is light: where it is, is day, where it was, is night; and history is an impertinence and an injury if it be any thing more than a cheerful apologue or parable of my being and becoming.","Shakespeare will never be made by the study of Shakespeare.

We have theories of races and of functions, but scarcely yet a remote approach to an idea of creation. We are now so far from the road to truth, that religious teachers dispute and hate each other, and speculative men are esteemed unsound and frivolous. But to a sound judgment, the most abstract truth is the most practical. Whenever a true theory appears, it will be its own evidence. Its test is, that it will explain all phenomena. Now many are thought not only unexplained but inexplicable; as language, sleep, madness, dreams, beasts, sex.","FableThe mountain and the squirrelHad a quarrel,And the former called the latter, \\"little prig \\":Bun replied,\\"You are doubtless very big;But all sorts of things and weatherMust be taken in togetherTo make up a year,And a sphere.And I think it no disgraceTo occupy my place.If I\'m not so large as you,You are not so small as I,And not half so spry.I\'ll not deny you makeA very pretty squirrel track;Talents differ; all is well and wisely put;If I cannot carry forests on my back,Neither can you crack a nut.","In a certain state of thought is the common origin of very diverse works.

It is necessary to use these pleasures with great temperance. For, nature is not always tricked in holiday attire, but the same scene which yesterday breathed perfume and glittered as for the frolic of the nymphs, is overspread with melancholy today. Nature always wears the colors of the spirit. To a man laboring under calamity, the heat of his own fire hath sadness in it. Then, there is a kind of contempt of the landscape felt by him who has just lost by death a dear friend.

Nature is always clarifying her water and her wine. No filtration can be so perfect. She does the same thing by books as by her gases and plants. There is always a selection in writers, and then a selection from the selection. In the first place, all books that get fairly into the vital air of the world were written by the successful class, by the affirming and advancing class, who utter what tens of thousands feel though they cannot say. There has already been a scrutiny and choice from many hundreds of young pens before the pamphlet or political chapter which you read in a fugitive journal comes to your eye. All these are young adventurers, who produce their performance to the wise ear of Time, who sits and weighs, and, ten years hence, out of a million of pages reprints one. Again it is judged, it is winnowed by all the winds of opinion, and what terrific selection has not passed on it before it can be reprinted after twenty years;\u2014and reprinted after a century!","There seems to be a necessity in spirit to manifest itself in material forms; and day and night, river and storm, beast and bird, acid and alkali, preexist in necessary Ideas in the mind of God, and are what they are by virtue of preceding affections, in the world of spirit.

It is the storm within which endangers him, not the storm without.","I question the value of our civilization when I see that our public representatives have lost hold of the simplest, strongest truths.

When they are real, they are not glass threads or frost-work, but the solidest thing we know.","Beneath a necessity thus almighty, what is artificial in man\'s life seems insignificant. He seems to take his task so minutely from intimations of Nature, that his works become as it were hers, and he is no longer free. But if we work within this limit, she yields us all her strength. All powerful action is performed by bringing the forces of nature to bear upon our objects. We do not grind corn or lift the loom by our own strength, but we build a mill in such position as to set the north wind to play upon our instrument, or the elastic force of steam, or the ebb and flow of the sea. So in our handiwork, we do few things by muscular force, but we place ourselves in such attitudes as to bring the force of gravity, that is, the weight of the planet, to bear upon the spade or the axe we wield. In short, in all our operations we seek not to use our own, but to bring a quite infinite force to bear.","La persona deber\xeda aprender a detectar y observar ese destello de luz que atraviesa su mente desde adentro, m\xe1s que el realce del firmamento de los bardos y sabios.

This love of beauty is Taste. Others have the same love in such excess, that, not content with admiring, they seek to embody it in new forms. The creation of beauty is Art. The production of a work of art throws a light upon the mystery of humanity. A work of art is an abstract or epitome of the world. It is the result or expression of nature, in miniature. For, although the works of nature are innumerable and all different, the result or the expression of them all is similar and single. Nature is a sea of forms radically alike and even unique. A leaf, a sun-beam, a landscape, the ocean, make an analogous impression on the mind. What is common to them all,\u2014that perfectness and harmony, is beauty. The standard of beauty is the entire circuit of natural forms,\u2014the totality of nature; which the Italians expressed by defining beauty \\"il piu nell\' uno.\\" Nothing is quite beautiful alone: nothing but is beautiful in the whole. A single object is only so far beautiful as it suggests this universal grace. The poet, the painter, the sculptor, the musician, the architect, seek each to concentrate this radiance of the world on one point, and each in his several work to satisfy the love of beauty which stimulates him to produce. Thus is Art, a nature passed through the alembic of man. Thus in art, does nature work through the will of a man filled with the beauty of her first works.","An enraged man is a lion, a cunning man is a fox, a firm man is a rock, a learned man is a torch.","Do the thing you fear and the death of fear is certain","Nature magically suits the man to his fortunes, by making these the fruit of his character.","Why should not we also enjoy an original relation to the universe?

It is exalted by the beauty of sunlight, the play of the clouds, the landscape around it, its grouping with the houses, trees, and towers in its vicinity. The pleasure of eloquence is in greatest part owing often to the stimulus of the occasion which produces it, \u2014 to the magic of sympathy, which exalts the feeling of each by radiating on him the feeling of all. The effect of music belongs how much to the place, as the church, or the moonlight walk; or to the company; or, if on the stage, to what went before in the play, or to the expectation of what shall come after.","But if a man would be alone, let him look at the stars. The rays that come from those heavenly worlds, will separate between him and what he touches. One might think the atmosphere was made transparent with this design, to give man, in the heavenly bodies, the perpetual presence of the sublime.","Give All to LoveGive all to love;Obey thy heart;Friends, kindred, days,Estate, good-fame,Plans, credit and the Muse,\u2014Nothing refuse.\u2019T is a brave master;Let it have scope:Follow it utterly,Hope beyond hope:High and more highIt dives into noon,With wing unspent,Untold intent:But it is a god,Knows its own pathAnd the outlets of the sky.It was never for the mean;It requireth courage stout.Souls above doubt,Valor unbending,It will reward,\u2014They shall returnMore than they were,And ever ascending.Leave all for love;Yet, hear me, yet,One word more thy heart behoved,One pulse more of firm endeavor,\u2014Keep thee to-day,To-morrow, forever,Free as an ArabOf thy beloved.Cling with life to the maid;But when the surprise,First vague shadow of surmiseFlits across her bosom young,Of a joy apart from thee,Free be she, fancy-free;Nor thou detain her vesture\u2019s hem,Nor the palest rose she flungFrom her summer diadem.Though thou loved her as thyself,As a self of purer clay,Though her parting dims the day,Stealing grace from all alive;Heartily know,When half-gods go, The gods arrive.","But how insular and pathetically solitary are all the people we know!

Time does not pass, we pass.","Wise men read very sharply all your private history in your look and gait and behavior. The whole economy of nature is bent on expression. The telltale body is all tongues.","The law of harmonic sounds reappears in the harmonic colors. The granite is differenced in its laws only by the more or less of heat from the river that wears it away. The river, as it flows, resembles the air that flows over it; the air resembles the light which traverses it with more subtile currents; the light resembles the heat which rides with it through Space. Each creature is only a modification of the other; the likeness in them is more than the difference, and their radical law is one and the same. A rule of one art, or a law of one organization, holds true throughout nature. So intimate is this Unity, that, it is easily seen, it lies under the undermost garment of Nature, and betrays its source in Universal Spirit. For it pervades Thought also. Every universal truth which we express in words, implies or supposes every other truth. Omne verum vero consonat. It is like a great circle on a sphere, comprising all possible circles; which, however, may be drawn and comprise it in like manner. Every such truth is the absolute Ens seen from one side. But it has innumerable sides.","The beauty of nature re-forms itself in the mind, and not for barren contemplation, but for new creation.","But what is classification but the perceiving that these objects are not chaotic, and are not foreign, but have a law which is also a law of the human mind?","We see insurmountable multitudes obeying, in opposition to their strongest passions, the restraints of a power which they scarcely perceive, and the crimes of a single individual marked and punished at the distance of half the earth.","The bitterest tragic element in life to be derived from an intellectual source is the belief in a brute Fate or Destiny; the belief that the order of nature and events is controlled by a law not adapted to man, nor man to that, but which holds on its way to the end, serving him if his wishes chance to lie in the same course, \u2014 crushing him if his wishes lie contrary to it, \u2014 and heedless whether it serves or crushes him. This is the terrible idea that lies at the foundation of the old Greek tragedy, and makes the; Oedipus and Antigone and Orestes objects of such hopeless commiseration. They must perish, and there is no over-god to stop or to mollify this hideous enginery that grinds and thunders, and takes them up into its terrific system. (...) But this terror of contravening an unascertained and unascertainable will, cannot coexist with reflection: it disappears with civilization, and can no more be reproduced than the fear of ghosts after childhood. It is discriminated from the doctrine of Philosophical Necessity herein: that the last is an Optimism, and therefore the suffering individual finds his good consulted in the good of all, of which he is a part. But in Destiny, it is not the good of the whole or the best will that is enacted, but only one particular will. Destiny properly is not a will at all, but an immense whim; and this is the only ground of terror and despair in the rational mind, and of tragedy in literature. Hence the antique tragedy, which was founded on this faith, can never be reproduced.","A deep man, believes that the evil eye can wither, that the heart\'s blessing can heal, and that love can overcome all odds","Tis not important how the hero does this or this, but what he is.

In this way the moment and the character are one.","Every natural fact is a symbol of some spiritual fact","Trust thyself: every heart vibrates to that iron string. Accept the place the divine providence has found for you, the society of your contemporaries, and the connection of events. Great men have always done so, and confided themselves childlike to the genius of their age, betraying their perception that the absolutely trustworthy was seated at their heart, working through their hands, predominating in all their being. And we are now men, and must accept in the highest mind the same transcendent destiny; and not minors and invalids in a protected corner, not cowards fleeing before a revolution, but guides, redeemers, and benefactors, obeying the Almighty effort, and advancing on Chaos and the Dark.","The best rule of reading will be a method from nature, and not a mechanical one of hours and pages.","Ahmak\xe7a tutarl\u0131l\u0131k, k\xfc\xe7\xfck ak\u0131llar\u0131n gulyabanisidir, k\xfc\xe7\xfck devlet adamlar\u0131, filozoflar ve ilahiyat\xe7\u0131lar ise tapar ona.

Each age, it is found, must write its owns books; or rather, each generation for the next succeeding. The books of an older period will not fit this.","Life is a journey, not a destination","It is one of those fables, which, out of an unknown antiquity, convey an unlooked-for wisdom, that the gods, in the beginning, divided Man into men, that he might be more helpful to himself; just as the hand was divided into fingers, the better to answer its end.","Nothing great was ever achieved without enthusiasm","Speak what you think now in hard words, and to-morrow speak what to-morrow thinks in hard words again, though it contradict every thing you said to-day. \u2014 \'Ah, so you shall be sure to be misunderstood.\' \u2014 Is it so bad, then, to be misunderstood?

Ralph Waldo Emerson (1803-1882).\u201d","The power of Nature predominates over the human will in all works of even the fine arts, in all that respects their material and external circumstanees. Nature paints the best part of the picture, carves the best part of the statue, builds the best part of the house, and speaks the best part of the oration.","There will be an agreement in whatever variety of actions, so they be each honest and natural in their hour. For of one will, the actions will be harmonious, however unlike they seem.","Nature, in its ministry to man, is not only the material, but is also the process and the result. All the parts incessantly work into each other\u2019s hands for the profit of man. The wind sows the seed; the sun evaporates the sea; the wind blows the vapor to the field; the ice, on the other side of the planet, condenses rain on this; the rain feeds the plant; the plant feeds the animal; and thus the endless circulations of the divine charity nourish man.","Resisting change is like getting one thought stuck in your head and refusing to move on with the flow of life\u2014we call that insanity.","Tis not in the high stars alone,Nor in the cup of budding flowers,Nor in the redbreast\'s mellow tone,Nor in the bow that smiles in showers,But in the mud and scum of thingsThere alway, alway something sings.","True love transcends the unworthy object, and dwells and broods on the eternal, and when the poor interposed mask crumbles, it is not sad, but feels rid of so much earth, and feels its independency the surer.","of cities, how great they are!

The artist who is to produce a work which is to be admired, not by his friends or his townspeople or his contemporaries but by all men, and which is to be more beautiful to the eye in proportion to its culture, must disindividualize himself, and be a man of no party and no manner and no age, but one through whom the soul of all men circulates as the common air through his lungs.","For poetry was all written before time was, and whenever we are so finely organized that we can penetrate into that region where the air is music, we hear those primal warblings, and attempt to write them down...","To laugh often and much; to win the respect of intelligent people and the affection of children; to earn the appreciation of honest critics and endure the betrayal of false friends; to appreciate beauty; to find the best in others; to leave the world a bit better, whether by a healthy child, a garden patch, or a redeemed social condition; to know even one life has breathed easier because you have lived. This is to have succeeded.","Swing me in the upas boughs,Vampyre-fanned, when I carouse","The prize will not be sent to you. You have to win it.","In eloquence, the great triumphs of the art are when the orator is lifted above himself; when consciously he makes himself the mere tongue of the occasion and the hour, and says what cannot but be said. Hence the term abandonment, to describe the self-surrender of the orator. Not his will, but the principle on which he is horsed, the great connection and crisis of events, thunder in the ear of the crowd.","Every rational creature has all nature for his dowry and estate. It is his,if he will. He may divest himself of it; he may creep into a corner, andabdicate his kingdom, as most men do, but he is entitled to the world by hisconstitution.

Life is a festival only to the wise. Seen from the nook and chimney-side of prudence, it wears a ragged and dangerous front. The violations of the laws of nature by our predecessors and our contemporaries are punished in us also. The disease and deformity around us certify the infraction of natural, intellectual, and moral laws, and often violation on violation to breed such compound misery. A lockjaw that bends a man\u2019s head back to his heels, hydrophobia that makes him bark at his wife and babes, insanity that makes him eat grass; war, plague, cholera, famine indicate a certain ferocity in nature, which, as it had its inlet by human crime, must have its outlet by human suffering. Unhappily, almost no man exists who has not in his own person become, to some amount, a stockholder in the sin, and so made himself liable to a share in the expiation.","let him look into [fear\'s] eye and search its nature, inspect its origin, - see the whelping of this lion, - which lies no great way back; he will then find in himself a perfect comprehension of its nature and extent; he will have made his hands meet on the other side, and can henceforth defy it and pass on superior.","Over everything stands its daemon or soul, and, as the form of the thing is reflected by the eye, so the soul of the thing is reflected by a melody.","If he does really think that there is no distinction between virtue and vice, why, sir, when he leaves our houses let us count our spoons.\\" Samuel Johnson\\"The louder he talked of his honor, the faster we counted our spoons.\\" Ralph Waldo Emerson","Though we travel the world over to find the beautiful, we must carry it with us, or we find it not","\u038c\u03c4\u03b1\u03bd \u03b4\u03b9\u03b1\u03b2\u03ac\u03b6\u03c9 \u03ad\u03bd\u03b1 \u03ba\u03b1\u03bb\u03cc \u03b2\u03b9\u03b2\u03bb\u03af\u03bf, \u03b5\u03cd\u03c7\u03bf\u03bc\u03b1\u03b9 \u03b7 \u03b6\u03c9\u03ae \u03bc\u03bf\u03c5 \u03bd\u03b1 \u03b4\u03b9\u03b1\u03c1\u03ba\u03bf\u03cd\u03c3\u03b5 3000 \u03c7\u03c1\u03cc\u03bd\u03b9\u03b1.","Passion adds eyes; is a magnifying glass.

Pride can go without domestics, without fine clothes, can live in a house with two rooms, can eat potato, purslain, beans, lyed corn, can work on the soil, can travel afoot, can talk with poor men, or sit silent well contented in fine saloons. But vanity costs money, labor, horses, men, women, health and peace, and is still nothing at last; a long way leading nowhere. Only one drawback; proud people are intolerably selfish, and the vain are gentle and giving.","Don\u2019t choose the better person, choose the person who makes a better you.","In the presence of nature, a wild delight runs through the man, in spite of real sorrows. Nature says, \u2014 he is my creature, and [in spite of] all his impertinent griefs, he shall be glad with me.","Why should we assume the faults of our friend, or wife, or father, or child, because they sit around our hearth, or are said to have the same blood? All men have my blood, and I have all men\'s.","Beauty, in its largest and profoundest sense, is one expressionfor the universe. God is the all-fair. Truth, and goodness, and beauty, are butdifferent faces of the same All. But beauty in nature is not ultimate. It is theherald of inward and eternal beauty, and is not alone a solid and satisfactorygood. It must stand as a part, and not as yet the last or highest expression ofthe final cause of Nature.","Nature arms each man with some faculty which enables him to do easily some feat impossible to any other, and thus makes him necessary to society. This native determination guides his labor and his spending. He wants an equipment of means and tools proper to his talent. And to save on this point were to neutralize the special strength and helpfulness of each mind.

Great men, great nations have not been boasters and buffoons, but perceivers of the terror of life, and have manned themselves to face it.","But this beauty of Nature which is seen and felt as beauty, is the least part. The shows of day, the dewy morning, the rainbow, mountains, orchards in blossom, stars, moonlight, shadows in still water, and the like, if too eagerly hunted, become shows merely, and mock us with their unreality. Go out of the house to see the moon, and \'t is mere tinsel; it will not please as when its light shines upon your necessary journey.

All the rest behold in the hero or the poet their own green and crude being,\u2014ripened; yes, and are content to be less, so that may attain to its full stature. What a testimony, full of grandeur, full of pity, is borne to the demands of his own nature, by the poor clansman, the poor partisan, who rejoices in the glory of his chief! The poor and the low find some amends to their immense moral capacity, for their acquiescence in a political and social inferiority. They are content to be brushed like flies from the path of a great person, so that justice shall be done by him to that common nature which it is the dearest desire of all to see enlarged and glorified. They sun themselves in the great man\u2019s light, and feel it to be their own element. They cast the dignity of man from their downtrod selves upon the shoulders of a hero, and will perish to add one drop of blood to make that great heart beat, those giant sinews combat and conquer. He lives for us, and we live in him.\u201d","There was never a child so lovely, but his mother was glad to get him to sleep.","The good are befriended even by weakness and defect. As no man had ever a point of pride that was not injurious to him so no man had ever a defect that was not somewhat made useful to him. ...Every man in his lifetime needs to thank his faults...","If peace is to be maintained, it must be by brave men, who have come up to the same height as the hero, namely, the will to carry their life in their hand, and stake it at any instant for their principle, but who have gone one step beyond the hero, and will not seek another man\'s life.","The misery of man appears like childish petulance, when we explore the steady and prodigal provision that has been made for his support and delight on this green ball which floats him through the heavens.","That which we object to in others is often experiment for ourselves.","Another point of economy is to look for seed of the same kind as you sow, and not to hope to buy one kind with an other kind. Friendship buys friendship; justice, justice; military merit, military success...Yet there is commonly a confusion of expectations on these points. Hotspur lives for the moment, praises himself for it, and despises Furlong, that he does not. Hotspur of course is poor, and Furlong is a good provider. The odd circumstance is that Hotspur thinks it a superiority in himself, this improvidence, which ought to be rewarded with Furlong\'s lands.","Our greatest glory is not in never failingbut in rising up every time we fail.","sturdy lad from New Hampshire or Vermont, who in turn tries all the professions, who teams it, farms it, peddles, keeps a school, preaches, edits a newspaper, goes to Congress, buys a township, and so forth, in successive years, and always like a cat falls on his feet, is worth a hundred of these city dolls.","Do not follow where the path may lead. Go instead where there is no path and make a trail.","No mountain is of any appreciable height to break the curve of the sphere.","Men seek to be great; they would have offices, wealth, power, and fame. They think that to be great is to possess one side of nature,\u2014the sweet, without the other side,\u2014the bitter.","Do not follow where the path may lead, go instead where there is no path and make a trail.","All things are moral; and in their boundless changes have an unceasing reference to spiritual nature. Therefore is nature glorious with form, color, and motion, that every globe in the remotest heaven; every chemical change from the rudest crystal up to the laws of life; every change of vegetation from the first principle of growth in the eye of a leaf, to the tropical forest and antediluvian coal-mine; every animal function from the sponge up to Hercules, shall hint or thunder to man the laws of right and wrong, and echo the Ten Commandments.","The advantage of the ideal theory over the popular faith, is this, that it presents the world in precisely that view which is most desirable to the mind. It is, in fact, the view which Reason, both speculative and practical, that is, philosophy and virtue, take. For, seen in the light of thought, the world always is phenomenal; and virtue subordinates it to the mind. Idealism sees the world in God. It beholds the whole circle of persons and things, of actions and events, of country and religion, not as painfully accumulated, atom after atom, act after act, in an aged creeping Past, but as one vast picture, which God paints on the instant eternity, for the contemplation of the soul. Therefore the soul holds itself off from a too trivial and microscopic study of the universal tablet.","WHOEVER considers the final cause of the world, will discern a multitude of uses that result. They all admit of being thrown into one of the following classes; Commodity; Beauty; Language; and Discipline. Under the general name of Commodity, I rank all those advantages which our senses owe to nature. This, of course, is a benefit which is temporary and mediate, not","Changing our thoughts, Emerson asserts, can actually change our circumstances.","To laugh often and much; to win the respect of intelligent people and the affection of children; to earn the appreciation of honest critics and endure the betrayal of false friends; to appreciate beauty, to find the best in others; to leave the world a bit better, whether by a healthy child, a garden patch or a redeemed social condition; to know even one life has breathed easier because you have lived. This is to have succeeded.","The field cannot be well seen from within the field.","The permanent interest of every man is never to be in a false position.","The same good office is performed by Property and its filial systems of debt and credit. Debt, grinding debt, whose iron face the widow, the orphan, and the sons of genius fear and hate;\u2014debt, which consumes so much time, which so cripples and disheartens a great spirit with cares that seem so base, is a preceptor whose lessons cannot be forgone, and is needed most by those who suffer from it most. Moreover, property, which has been well compared to snow,\u2014\\"if it fall level to-day, it will be blown into drifts to-morrow,\\"\u2014is the surface action of internal machinery, like the index on the face of a clock.","It sees something more important in Christianity, than the scandals of ecclesiastical history, or the niceties of criticism; and, very incurious concerning persons or miracles, and not at all disturbed by chasms of historical evidence, it accepts from God the phenomenon, as it finds it, as the pure and awful form of religion in the world. It is not hot and passionate at the appearance of what it calls its own good or bad fortune, at the union or opposition of other persons. No man is its enemy. It accepts whatsoever befalls, as part of its lesson. It is a watcher more than a doer, and it is a doer, only that it may the better watch.","As the eyes of Lync\xe6us were said to see through the earth, so the poet turns the world to glass, and shows us all things in their right series and procession.","INTRODUCTION. OUR age is retrospective. It builds the sepulchres of the fathers. It writes biographies, histories, and criticism. The foregoing generations beheld God and nature face to face; we, through their eyes. Why should not we also enjoy an original relation to the universe? Why should not we","In the woods too, a man casts off his years, as the snake his slough, and at what period soever of life, is always a child. In the woods, is perpetual youth. Within these plantations of God, a decorum and sanctity reign, a perennial festival is dressed, and the guest sees not how he should tire of them in a thousand years. In the woods, we return to reason and faith. There I feel that nothing can befall me in life,\u2014no disgrace, no calamity, (leaving me my eyes,) which nature cannot repair. Standing on the bare ground,\u2014my head bathed by the blithe air, and uplifted into infinite space,\u2014all mean egotism vanishes. I become a transparent eye-ball; I am nothing; I see all; the currents of the Universal Being circulate through me; I am part or particle of God. The","Herein is especially apprehended the unity of Nature,\u2014the unity in variety,\u2014which meets us everywhere. All the endless variety of things make an identical impression. Xenophanes complained in his old age, that, look where he would, all things hastened back to Unity.","We can foresee God in the coarse, and, as it were, distant phenomena of matter; but when we try to define and describe himself, both language and thought desert us, and we are as helpless as fools and savages. That essence refuses to be recorded in propositions, but when man has worshipped him intellectually, the noblest ministry of nature is to stand as the apparition of God. It is the organ through which the universal spirit speaks to the individual, and strives to lead back the individual to it. When we consider Spirit, we see that the views already presented do not include the whole circumference of man. We must add some related thoughts.","That law of nature whereby everything climbs to higher platforms, and bodily vigor becomes mental and moral vigor. The bread he eats is first strength and animal spirits; it becomes, in higher laboratories, imagery and thought; and in still higher results, courage and endurance. This is the right compound interest; this is capital doubled, quadrupled, centupled; man raised to his highest power. The true thrift is always to spend on the higher plane; to invest and invest, with keener avarice, that he may spend in spiritual creation and not in augmenting animal existence.","Not only resemblances exist in things whose analogy is obvious, as when we detect the type of the human hand in the flipper of the fossil saurus, but also in objects wherein there is great superficial unlikeness. Thus architecture is called \\"frozen music,\\" by De Stael and Goethe. Vitruvius thought an architect should be a musician. \\"A Gothic church,\\" said Coleridge, \\"is a petrified religion.\\" Michael Angelo maintained, that, to an architect, a knowledge of anatomy is essential. In Haydn\'s oratorios, the notes present to the imagination not only motions, as, of the snake, the stag, and the elephant, but colors also; as the green grass. The law of harmonic sounds reappears in the harmonic colors. The granite is differenced in its laws only by the more or less of heat, from the river that wears it away. The river, as it flows, resembles the air that flows over it; the air resembles the light which traverses it with more subtile currents; the light resembles the heat which rides with it through Space. Each creature is only a modification of the other; the likeness in them is more than the difference, and their radical law is one and the same.","Finish everyday and be done with it. You have done what you could.","Whilst thus the poet animates nature with his own thoughts, he differs from the philosopher only herein, that the one proposes Beauty as his main end; the other Truth.","\xbfEs tan malo, entonces, el sermal interpretado? Pit\xe1goras fue mal interpretado, y lo fueron S\xf3crates, Jes\xfas,Lutero y Galileo, y lo fueron todos los esp\xedritus puros y graves que han honrado a lahumanidad. Ser grande es ser mal comprendido.","There is for every man a statement possible of that truth which he is most unwilling to receive, \u2014 a statement possible, so broad and so pungent that he cannot get away from it, but must either bend to it or die of it.","There are no fixtures to men, if we appeal to consciousness. Every man supposed himself not to be fully understood; and if there is any truth in him, if he rests at last on the divine soul, I see not how it can be otherwise. The last chamber, the last closet, he must feel was never opened; there is always a residuum unknown, unanalyzed. That is, every man believes that he has a greater possibility.","Idealism saith: matter is a phenomenon, not a substance. Idealism acquaints us with the total disparity between the evidence of our own being, and the evidence of the world\'s being. The one is perfect; the other, incapable of any assurance; the mind is a part of the nature of things; the world is a divine dream, from which we may presently awake to the glories and certainties of day. Idealism is a hypothesis to account for nature by other principles than those of carpentry and chemistry. Yet, if it only deny the existence of matter, it does not satisfy the demands of the spirit. It leaves God out of me. It leaves me in the splendid labyrinth of my perceptions, to wander without end.","If there is any period one would desire to be born in, is it not the age of Revolution; when the old and the new stand side by side, and admit of being compared; when the energies of all men are searched by fear and by hope; when the historic glories of the old can be compensated by the rich possibilities of the new era","I see the spectacle of morning from the hill-top over against my house, from day-break to sun-rise, with emotions which an angel might share","From the earth, as a shore, I look out into that silent sea. I seem to partake its rapid transformations; the active enchantment reaches my dust, and I dilate and conspire with the morning wind.","The virtue in most request is conformity. Self-reliance is its aversion. It loves not realities and creators, but names and customs . . . Whoso would be a man must also be a non-conformist.","As a plant upon the earth, so a man rests upon the bosom of God; he is nourished by unfailing fountains, and draws, at his need, inexhaustible power. Who can set bounds to the possibilities of man?","Love is as much its demand as perception. Indeed, neither can be perfect without the other.","Man is timid and apologetic; he is no longer upright; he dares not say \\"I think,\\" \\"I am,\\" but quotes some saint or safe.","The things that are seen, are temporal; the things that are unseen, are eternal.\\" It","In a virtuous community, men of sense and of principle will always be placed at the head of affairs. In a declining state of public morals, men will be so blinded to their true interests as to put the incapable and unworthy at the helm. It is therefore vain to complain of the follies or crimes of a government. We must lay our hands on our own hearts and say \'Here is the sin that makes the public sin\'.","If he had the earth for his pasture and the sea for his pond, he would be a pauper still. He only is rich who owns the day. There is no king, rich man, fairy or demon who possesses such power as that.Mentioned inSixty Days and Counting, by Kim Stanley Robinson","by knowledge the privilege to BE! His insight refines him. The beauty of nature shines in his own breast. Man is greater that he can see this, and the universe less, because Time and Space relations vanish as laws are known. Here again we are impressed and even daunted by the immense Universe to be explored. \\"What we know, is a point to what we do not know.\\" Open any recent journal of science, and weigh the problems suggested concerning Light, Heat, Electricity, Magnetism, Physiology, Geology, and judge whether the interest of natural science is likely to be soon exhausted. Passing by many particulars of the discipline of nature, we must not omit to specify two.

That discovery is called the Fall of Man. Ever afterwards, we suspect our instruments. We have learned that we do not see directly, but mediately, and that we have no means of correcting these colored and distorting lenses which we are, or of computing the amount of their errors. Perhaps these subject-lenses have a creative power; perhaps there are no objects. Once we lived in what we saw; now, the rapaciousness of this new power, which threatens to absorb all things, engages us. Nature, art, persons, letters, religions\u2014objects, successively tumble in, and God is but one of its ideas.","Standing on the bare ground,\u2014my head bathed by the blithe air, and uplifted into infinite space,\u2014all mean egotism vanishes. I become a transparent eye-ball; I am nothing; I see all; the currents of the Universal Being circulate through me; I am part or particle of God.","No law can be sacred to me but that of my nature. Good and bad are but names very readily transferable to that or this; the only right is what is after my constitution, the only wrong what is against it.","The foregoing generations beheld God and nature face to face; we, through their eyes. Why should not we also enjoy an original relation to the universe?","When you have worn out shoes, the strength of the shoe leather has passed into the fiber of your body. I measure your health by the number of shoes and hats and clothes you have worn out.","The dawn is my Assyria; the sun-set and moon-rise my Paphos, and unimaginable realms of faerie; broad noon shall be my England of the senses and the understanding; the night shall be my Germany of mystic philosophy and dreams.","whatever instances can be quoted of unpunished theft, or of a lie which somebody credited, justice must prevail, and it is the privilege of truth to make itself believed.","In this refulgent summer, it has been a luxury to draw the breath of life.","If Love his moment overstay,Hatred\'s swift repulsions play.","Build therefore your own world. As fast as you conform your life to the pure idea in your mind, that will unfold its great proportions.","The practical common-sense of modern society, the utilitarian direction which labor, laws, opinion, religion, take, is the natural genius of the British mind.","We as we read must become Greeks, Romans, Turks, priest and king, martyr and executioner, must fasten these images to some reality in our secret experience, or we shall learn nothing rightly.","Thus we do not carry a counsel in our breasts, or do not know it; and because we cannot shake off from our shoes this dust of Europe and Asia, the world seems to be born old, society is under a spell, every man is a borrower and a mimic, life is theatrical and literature a quotation; and hence that depression of spirits, that furrow of care, said to mark every American brow.","Bir tehdit kar\u015f\u0131s\u0131nda tazelenen insanlar vard\u0131r.

Go out of the house to see the moon, and \'t is mere tinsel; it will not please as when its light shines upon your necessary journey.","Emerson\'s own best insight into fame is in his essay on Character. \\"The most dismaying aspect of fame from the point of view of its possessor is not just that fame is generally disproportionate to actual achievement, but that the fame that we first assume to be a reward for work well done becomes instead an impossible promise of about future work. Fame casts an anticipatory chill over current efforts because it awakens expectations that can never fully be met\\".","Who looks upon a river in a meditative hour, and is not reminded of the flux of all things?

Everybody likes to know that his advantages cannot be attributed to air, soil, sea, or to local wealth, as mines and quarries, nor to laws and traditions, nor to fortune, but to superior brain, as it makes the praise more personal to him.","The world thus exists to the soul to satisfy the desire of beauty. This element I call an ultimate end. No reason can be asked or given why the soul seeks beauty. Beauty, in its largest and profoundest sense, is one expression for the universe. God is the all-fair. Truth, and goodness, and beauty, are but different faces of the same All. But beauty in nature is not ultimate. It is the herald of inward and eternal beauty, and is not alone a solid and satisfactory good. It must stand as a part, and not as yet the last or highest expression of the final cause of Nature.","A man is relieved and gay when he has put his heart into his work and done his best;","Man runs about restless and in pain when his condition or the objects about him do not fully match his thought.","Day and night, house and garden, a few books, a few actions, serve us as well as would all trades and all spectacles.","Make yourself necessary to somebody.

Their works are done as an apology or extenuation of their living in the world, \u2014 as invalids and the insane pay a high board. Their virtues are penances. I do not wish to expiate, but to live. My life is for itself and not for a spectacle. I much prefer that it should be of a lower strain, so it be genuine and equal, than that it should be glittering and unsteady. I wish it to be sound and sweet, and not to need diet and bleeding. I ask primary evidence that you are a man, and refuse this appeal from the man to his actions. I know that for myself it makes no difference whether I do or forbear those actions which are reckoned excellent. I cannot consent to pay for a privilege where I have intrinsic right. Few and mean as my gifts may be, I actually am, and do not need for my own assurance or the assurance of my fellows any secondary testimony.","In Scotland, there is a rapid loss of all grandeur of mien and manners; a provincial eagerness and acuteness appear; the poverty of the country makes itself remarked, and a coarseness of manners; and, among the intellectual, is the insanity of dialectics.","Your goodness must have some edge to it, else it is none.","vaults.

Let us interrogate the great apparition, that shines so peacefully around us. Let us inquire, to what end is nature?","We are now so far from the road to truth, that religious teachers dispute and hate each other, and speculative men are esteemed unsound and frivolous. But to a sound judgment, the most abstract truth is the most practical. Whenever a true theory appears, it will be its own evidence. Its test is, that it will explain all phenomena. Now many are thought not only unexplained but inexplicable; as language, sleep, madness, dreams, beasts, sex.","There is the power of complexions, obviously modifying the dispositions and sentiments.","The old men are as red as roses, and still handsome. A clear skin, a peach-bloom complexion, and good teeth are found all over the island.","What I must do is all that concerns me, not what the people think . . . the great man is he who in the midst of the crowd keeps with perfect sweetness the independence of solitude.","But if a man would be alone, let him look at the stars. The rays that come from those heavenly worlds, will separate between him and what he touches. One might think the atmosphere was made transparent with this design, to give man, in the heavenly bodies, the perpetual presence of the sublime. Seen in the streets of cities, how great they are! If the stars should appear one night in a thousand years, how would men believe and adore; and preserve for many generations the remembrance of the city of God which had been shown! But every night come out these envoys of beauty, and light the universe with their admonishing smile.","If the red slayer think he slays, / Or if the slain think he is slain, / They know not well the subtle ways / I keep, and pass, and turn again. / Far or forgot to me is near; / Shadow and sunlight are the same; / The vanished gods to me appear; / And one to me are shame and fame. / They reckon ill who leave me out; / When me they fly, I am the wings; / I am the doubter and the doubt, / And I the hymn the Brahmin sings. / The strong gods pine for my abode, / And pine in vain the sacred Seven; / But thou, meek lover of the good! / Find me, and turn thy back on heaven.","Oh, what have I to do with time?","Colleges and books only copy the language which the field and the work-yard made.","When we speak of nature in this manner, we have a distinct but most poetical sense in the mind. We mean the integrity of impression made by manifold natural objects. It is this which distinguishes the stick of timber of the wood-cutter, from the tree of the poet. The charming landscape which I saw this morning, is indubitably made up of some twenty or thirty farms. Miller owns this field, Locke that, and Manning the woodland beyond. But none of them owns the landscape.","Our friendships hurry to short and poor conclusions, because we have made them a texture of wine and dreams, instead of the tough fiber of the human heart.","Literature is a heap of nouns and verbs enclosing an intuition or two","But Homer\'s words are as costly and admirable to Homer, as Agamemnon\'s victories are to Agamemnon","In the woods, we return to reason and faith.

Another class live above this mark to the beauty of the symbol, as the poet and artist and the naturalist and man of science. A third class live above the beauty of the symbol to the beauty of the thing signified; these are wise men.","The history of persecution is a history of endeavors to cheat nature, to make water run up hill, to twist a rope of sand. It makes no difference whether the actors be many or one, a tyrant or a mob. A mob is a society of bodies voluntarily bereaving themselves of reason and traversing its work. The mob is man voluntarily descending to the nature of the beast. Its fit hour of activity is night. Its actions are insane, like its whole constitution. It persecutes a principle; it would whip a right; it would tar and feather justice, by inflicting fire and outrage upon the houses and persons of those who have these. It resembles the prank of boys, who run with fire-engines to put out the ruddy aurora streaming to the stars. The inviolate spirit turns their spite against the wrongdoers. The martyr cannot be dishonored. Every lash inflicted is a tongue of fame; every prison a more illustrious abode; every burned book or house enlightens the world; every suppressed or expunged word reverberates through the earth from side to side. The minds of men are at last aroused; reason looks out and justifies her own and malice finds all her work in vain. It is the whipper who is whipped and the tyrant who is undone.","Theinstincts of the ant are very unimportant, considered as the ant\u2019s; but themoment a ray of relation is seen to extend from it to man, and the little drudgeis seen to be a monitor, a little body with a mighty heart, then all its habits,even that said to be recently observed, that it never sleeps, become sublime.","I hate quotes: tell me what you know.","To the attentive eye, each moment of the year has its own beauty, and in the same field, it beholds, every hour, a picture which was never seen before, and which shall never be seen again. The heavens change every moment, and reflect their glory or gloom on the plains beneath.","There is a relation between the hours of our life and the centuries of time. As the air I breathe is drawn from the great repositories of nature, as the light on my book is yielded by a star a hundred millions of miles distant, as the poise of my body depends on the equilibrium of centrifugal and centripetal forces, so the hours should be instructed by the ages, and the ages explained by the hours.","What we know, is a point to what we do not know.\\" Open","Good men must not obey the laws too well.","That divided and rebel mind, that distrust of a sentiment because our arithmetic has computed the strength and means opposed to our purpose, these [158] have not.

Then shall come to pass what my poet said; \'Nature is not fixed but fluid. Spirit alters, moulds, makes it. The immobility or bruteness of nature, is the absence of spirit; to pure spirit, it is fluid, it is volatile, it is obedient. Every spirit builds itself a house; and beyond its house a world; and beyond its world, a heaven. Know then, that the world exists for you.

The parti-colored wheel must revolve very fast to appear white. Something is earned too by conversing with so much folly and defect. In fine, whoever loses, we are always of the gaining party. Divinity is behind our failures and follies also. The plays of children are nonsense, but very educative nonsense. So it is with the largest and solemnest things, with commerce, government, church, marriage, and so with the history of every man\u2019s bread, and the ways by which he is to come by it. Like a bird which alights nowhere, but hops perpetually from bough to bough, is the Power which abides in no man and in no woman, but for a moment speaks from this one, and for another moment from that one.","The next great influence into the spirit of the scholar, is, the mind of the Past,\u2014in whatever form, whether of literature, of art, of institutions, that mind is inscribed. Books are the best type of the influence of the past, and perhaps we shall get at the truth,\u2014learn the amount of this influence more conveniently,\u2014by considering their value alone.","To fill the hour,\u2014that is happiness; to fill the hour, and leave no crevice for a repentance or an approval.","Language is fossil poetry","We are we ar,","Heartily know, when half-gods go, the gods arrive.","Sweet is death forevermore.","Who is he that shall control me?

And must I wear them? Is Society my anointed King? Or is there any mightier community or any man or more than man, whose slave I am? I am solitary in the vast society of beings; I consort with no species; I indulge no sympathies. I see the world, human, brute & inanimate nature; I am in the midst of them, but not of them; I hear the song of the storm\u2014 the Winds & warring Elements sweep by me\u2014 but they mix not with my being.

Star by Star, world by world, system by system shall be crushed\u2014 but I shall live.","Visible distance behind and before us, is respectively our image of memory and hope.","The advantage of the ideal theory over the popular faith, is this, that it presents the world in precisely that view which is most desirable to the mind. It is, in fact, the view which Reason, both speculative and practical, that is, philosophy and virtue, take. For, seen in the light of thought, the world always is phenomenal; and virtue subordinates it to the mind.","TO go into solitude, a man needs to retire as much from his chamber as from society. I am not solitary whilst I read and write, though nobody is with me. But if a man would be alone, let him look at the stars.","Though we travel the world over to find the beautiful, we must carry it within us or we find it not. \u2015 Ralph Waldo Emerson","the sour faces of the multitude, like their sweet faces, have no deep cause, but are put on and off as the wind blows and a newspaper directs.

Therefore is Space, and therefore Time, that man may know that things are not huddled and lumped, but sundered and individual. A bell and a plough have each their use, and neither can do the office of the other. Water is good to drink, coal to burn, wool to wear; but wool cannot be drunk, nor water spun, nor coal eaten. The wise man shows his wisdom in separation, in gradation, and his scale of creatures and of merits is as wide as nature. The foolish have no range in their scale, but suppose every man is as every other man. What is not good they call the worst, and what is not hateful, they call the best.","There is no teaching until the pupil is brought into the same state or principle in which you are; a transfusion takes place; he is you and you are he; then is a teaching, and by no unfriendly chance or bad company can he ever quite lose the benefit.","I hate quotations.","education is more precious than that which we call so.","The invariable mark of wisdom is to see the miraculous in the common. What is a day? What is a year? What is summer? What is woman? What is a child? What is sleep? To our blindness, these things seem unaffecting. We make fables to hide the baldness of the fact and conform it, as we say, to the higher law of the mind. But when the fact is seen under the light of an idea, the gaudy fable fades and shrivels. We behold the real higher law. To the wise, therefore, a fact is true poetry, and the most beautiful of fables. These wonders are brought to our own door. You also are a man. Man and woman, and their social life, poverty, labor, sleep, fear, fortune, are known to you. Learn that none of these things is superficial, but that each phenomenon has its roots in the faculties and affections of the mind. Whilst the abstract question occupies your intellect, nature brings it in the concrete to be solved by your hands.","Many times the reading of a book has made the fortune of the man-has decided his way of life. \'Tis a tie between men to have been delighted with the same book.","Philosophically considered, the universe consists of Nature and the Soul.","the best read naturalist who lends an entire and devout attention to truth, will see that there remains much to learn of his relation to the world, and that it is not to be learned by any addition or subtraction or other comparison of known quantities, but is arrived at by untaught sallies of the spirit, by a continual self-recovery, and by entire humility. He will perceive that there are far more excellent qualities in the student than preciseness and infallibility; that a guess is often more fruitful than an indisputable affirmation, and that a dream may let us deeper into the secret of nature than a hundred concerted experiments.","that Adam had, all that Caesar could, you have and can do.

The mob is man voluntarily descending to the nature of the beast. Its fit hour of activity is night. Its actions are insane like its whole constitution; it persecutes a principle; it would whip a right; it would tar and feather justice, by inflicting fire and outrage upon the houses and persons of those who have these.","Imagination is not a talent of some men, but is health of every man.","Speak what you think now in hard words and to-morrow speak what to-morrow thinks in hard words again, though it contradict every thing you said to-day.\u2014\'Ah, so you shall be sure to be misunderstood.\'\u2014Is it so bad then to be misunderstood? Pythagoras was misunderstood, and Socrates, and Jesus, and Luther, and Copernicus, and Galileo, and Newton, and every pure and wise spirit that ever took flesh. To be great is to be misunderstood.","But wise men pierce this rotten diction and fasten words again to visiblethings; so that picturesque language is at once a commanding certificate that hewho employs it, is a man in alliance with truth and God. The moment ourdiscourse rises above the ground line of familiar facts, and is inflamed withpassion or exalted by thought, it clothes itself in images. A man conversing inearnest, if he watch his intellectual processes, will find that a materialimage, more or less luminous, arises in his mind, cotemporaneous with everythought, which furnishes the vestment of the thought. Hence, good writing andbrilliant discourse are perpetual allegories. This imagery is spontaneous. It isthe blending of experience with the present action of the mind. It is propercreation.

It is easy in the world to live after the world\'s opinion; it is easy in solitude to live after our own; but the great man is he who in the midst of the crowd keeps with perfect sweetness the independence of solitude.","Flowers and fruits are always fit presents; flowers, because they are a proud assertion that a ray of beauty outvalues all the utilities of the world. These gay natures contrast with the somewhat stern countenance of ordinary nature: they are like music heard out of a work-house. Nature does not cocker us; we are children, not pets; she is not fond; everything is dealt to us without fear or favor, after severe universal laws. Yet these delicate flowers look like the frolic and interference of love and beauty. Men use to tell us that we love flattery even though we are not deceived by it, because it shows that we are of importance enough to be courted. Something like that pleasure, the flowers give us: what am I to whom these sweet hints are addressed?","Y se expresaron con sus propias palabras, no con las palabras de los dem\xe1s hombres","A man who stands united with his thought conceives magnificently of himself.","The man who knows how will always have a job.

Idealism acquaints us with the total disparity between the evidence of our own being, and the evidence of the world\'s being. The one is perfect; the other, incapable of any assurance; the mind is a part of the nature of things; the world is a divine dream, from which we may presently awake to the glories and certainties of day. Idealism is a hypothesis to account for nature by other principles than those of carpentry and chemistry. Yet,","Dreams and beasts are two keys by which we find out the secret of our own nature. They are test objects.","Good and bad are but names very readily transferable to that or this; the only right is what is after my constitution, the only wrong what is against it.","I love this piece...BrahmaIf the red slayer think he slays,Or if the slain think he is slain,They know not well the subtle waysI keep, and pass, and turn again.Far or forgot to me is near,Shadow and sunlight are the same,The vanished gods to me appear,And one to me are shame and fame.They reckon ill who leave me out;When me they fly, I am the wings;I am the doubter and the doubt,And I the hymn the Brahmin sings.The strong gods pine for my abode,And pine in vain the sacred Seven;But thou, meek lover of the good!Find me, and turn thy back on heaven.","Nature loves analogies, but not repetitions.","LANGUAGE is a third use which Nature subserves to man.

The scholar of the first age received into him the world around; brooded thereon; gave it the new arrangement of his own mind, and uttered it again. It came into him, life; it went out from him, truth. It came to him, business; it went from him, poetry. It was dead fact; now, it is quick thought. It can stand, and it can go. It now endures, it now flies, it now inspires. Precisely in proportion to the depth of the mind from which it issued, so high does it soar, so long does it sing.","If the finest genius studies at one of our colleges, and is not installed in an office within one year afterwards in the cities or suburbs of Boston or New York, it seems to his friends and to himself that he is right in being disheartened, and in complaining the rest of his life. A sturdy lad from New Hampshire or Vermont, who in turn tries all the professions, who teams it, farms it, [225] peddles, keeps a school, preaches, edits a newspaper, goes to Congress, buys a township, and so forth, in successive years, and always, like a cat, falls on his feet, is worth a hundred of these city dolls.

Minerva said she hoped not, they were only ridiculous little creatures, with this odd circumstance, that they had a blur, or indeterminate aspect, seen far or seen near; if you called them bad, they would appear so; if you called them good, they would appear so; and there was no one person or action among that which would not puzzle her Owl, much more all Olympus, to know whether it was fundamentally bad or good.","This outlook, one that said that American history must be the history of nature speaking through men, not of men shaping nature, became the single most powerful force in American intellectual life in the nineteenth century and shaped some of America\'s greatest works of literature, such as Moby Dick, Leaves of Grass and Walden, as well as generating an American school of philosophy , to be furthered by William James and John Dewey.","A man\u2019s power to connect his thought with its proper symbol, and so to utter it, depends on the simplicity of his character, that is, upon his love of truth and his desire to communicate it without loss. The corruption of man is followed by the corruption of language. When simplicity of character and the sovereignty of ideas is broken up by the prevalence of secondary desires\u2014the desire of riches, of pleasure, of power, and of praise\u2014and duplicity and falsehood take place of simplicity and truth, the power over nature as an interpreter of the will is in a degree lost; new imagery ceases to be created, and old words are perverted to stand for things which are not; a paper currency is employed, when there is no bullion in the vaults. In due time the fraud is manifest, and words lose all power to stimulate the understanding or the affections. Hundreds of writers may be found in every long-civilized nation who for a short time believe and make others believe that they see and utter truths, who do not of themselves clothe one thought in its natural garment, but who feed unconsciously on the language created by the primary writers of the country, those, namely, who hold primarily on nature. But wise men pierce this rotten diction and fasten words again to visible things; so that picturesque language is at once a commanding certificate that he who employs it is a man in alliance with truth and God.

Our age yields no great and perfect persons. We want men and women who shall renovate life and our social state, but we see that most natures are insolvent, cannot satisfy their own wants, have an ambition out of all proportion to their practical force, and do lean and beg day and night continually. Our housekeeping is mendicant, our arts, our occupations, our marriages, our religion, we have not chosen, but society has chosen for us. We are parlour soldiers.
