So, in other words, they\'re paying me to show them, in combative form, the art of expressing the human body.","To me, ultimately, martial arts means honestly expressing yourself. Now, it is very difficult to do. It has always been very easy for me to put on a show and be cocky, and be flooded with a cocky feeling and feel pretty cool and all that.

But to experience oneself honestly, not lying to oneself, and to express myself honestly, now that is very hard to do.","To understand your fear is the beginning of really seeing.","Once I slow down because I think I have reached my peak, then my skills will go nowhere but down","If people say Jeet Kune Do is different from this or from that, then let the name of Jeet Kune Do be wiped out, for that is what it is, just a name.

But I am afraid of a person who knows one kick but practices it for 10000 times.","Life is better lived than conceptualized. \u2014 This writing can be less demanding should I allow myself to indulge in the usual manipulating game of role creation.

There is no longer a division or barrier between myself and others, no longer any feeling of alienation or fear   there is nothing apart from oneself and therefore nothing to fear. Realizing this results in true compassion. Other people and things are not seen as apart from oneself but, on the contrary, as one\'s own body.","One does not accumulate but eliminate. It is not daily increase but daily decrease. The height of cultivation always runs to simplicity.","The stillness in stillness is not the real stillness; only when there is stillness in movement does the universal rhythm manifest.","Live a life worth remembering.","Sincere thought means thought of concentration (quiet awareness).

They have big fat guts. They talk about chi power and things they can do, but don\'t believe it.","Truth cannot be structured or confined.","Empty your mind, be formless, shapeless - like water.","Its like a finger pointing away to the moon. Dont concentrate on the finger or you will miss all that heavenly glory.","Every morning like a scholar at his first class I prepare a blank mind for the day to write upon.","It is easy for me to put on a show and be cocky..but to express oneself honestly not lying to oneself, now that my friend is very hard to do","To be honest to oneself, and that is very hard to do.","Humility forms the basis of honor, just as the low ground forms the foundation of a high elevation.","If I should die tomorrow, I will have no regrets. I did what I wanted to do. You can\'t expect more from life.","I\'m moving and not moving at all. I\'m like the moon underneath the waves that ever go on rolling and rocking. It is not, \\"I am doing this,\\" but rather, an inner realization that \\"this is happening through me,\\" or \\"it is doing this for me.\\" The consciousness of self is the greatest hindrance to the proper execution of all physical action.","What comes after victory? Why do people value victory so much? What is \'glory\'? What kind of victory is \'glorious\'?","The height of cultivation always runs to simplicity.","An intelligent mind is an inquiring mind.

I\'m a student-master, meaning that I have the knowledge of a master and the expertise of a master, but I\'m still learning. So I\'m a student-master. I don\'t believe in the word \'master.\' I consider the master as such when they close the casket.","Art is never decoration, embellishment; instead, it is work of enlightenment. Art, in other words, is a technique for acquiring liberty.","Practice all movements slow and fast, soft and hard; the effectiveness of Jeet Kune-Do depends on split-second timing and reflexive action, which can be achieved only through repetitious practice.","There\u2019s only one basic principle of self-defense- you must apply the most effective weapon, as soon as possible, to the most vulnerable target.","Ever since I was a child I have had this instinctive urge for expansion and growth.","There is a powerful craving in most of us to see ourselves as instruments in the hands of others and thus free ourselves from the responsibility for acts which are prompted by our own questionable inclinations and impulses. Both the strong and the weak grasp at this alibi. The latter hide their malevolence under the virtue of obedience: they acted dishonorably because they had to obey orders. The strong, too, claim absolution by proclaiming themselves the chosen instrument of a higher power -- God, history, fate, nation, or humanity.","When you\'re talking about fighting, as it is, with no rules, well then, baby you\'d better train every part of your body!","It is true that the mental aspect of kung-fu is the desired end; however, to achieve this end, technical skill must come first.","Since weight training involves repetitions, a great deal of energy must be exerted.

I am convinced that an absolutely honest and direct inquiry into oneself will lead to understanding.","You must have complete determination. The worst opponent you can come across is one whose aim has become an obsession. For instance, if a man has decided that he is going to bite off your nose no matter what happens to him in the process, the chances are he will succeed in doing it. He may be severely beaten up, too, but that will not stop him from carrying out his objective. That is the real fighter.","When one has reached maturity in this art, one will have the formless form. It is like the dissolving or thawing [of] ice into water that can shape itself to any structure. When one has no form, one can be all forms; when one has no style, one can fit in with any style.","Know the difference between a catastrophe and an inconvenience. - To realize that it\'s just an inconvenience, that it is not a catastrophe, but just an unpleasantness, is part of coming into your own, part of waking up.","As you think, so shall you become.","I\'m a philosophy major. That means I can think deep thoughts about being unemployed.","I am not teaching you anything. I just help you to explore yourself.","A teacher is never a giver of truth; he is a guide, a pointer to the truth that each student must find for himself.","The success of an assailant\'s attack depends on surprise, and if you\'re sufficiently alert to prevent a surprise, your counterattack is already halfway to being successful.","when one is not expressing himself, he is not free. thus, he begins to struggle and the struggle breeds methodical routine. Soon, he is doing his methodical routine as response rather than responding to what is.","Circumstances hell! I make circumstances!","Pessimism blunts the tools you need to succeed.","A good teacher can never be fixed in a routine... each moment requires a sensitive mind that is constantly changing and constantly adapting. A teacher must never impose this student to fit his favourite pattern; a good teacher functions as a pointer, exposing his student\'s vulnerability and causing him to explore both internally and finally integrating himself with his being. Martial art should not be passed out indiscriminately.","Even today, I dare not say that I have reached a state of achievement. I\'m still learning, for learning is boundless.","To see is to be decieved.  To hear is to be lied to.  To FEEL is to believe.","Running water never grows stale.","Understand your limitations and capitalize on them.","Learning is never cumulative, it is a movement of knowing which has no beginning and no end.","Be self aware, rather than a repetitious robot","It is better to live as a broken piece of jade, than to live as a useless clay.","In order to taste my cup of water you must first empty your cup.","Let the spirit out - Discard all thoughts of reward, all hopes of praise and fears of blame, all awareness of one\'s bodily self. And, finally closing the avenues of sense perception, let the spirit out, as it will.","A good fighter must sense rather than perceive his chance to strike.","Art requires imagination. It requires Creativity. Creativity requires experience and experience comes from your life. And your life is expressed in your art.","Put every great teacher in a room, and they\'d agree about everything, but put their disciples in there and they\'d argue about everything.","The primary Reality is not what I think, but that I live, for those also live who do not think.","The idea is that flowing water never goes stale, so just keep on flowing.","A good martial artist does not become tense, but ready. Not thinking, yet not dreaming. Ready for whatever may come. When the opponent expands, I contract; and when he contracts, I expand. And when there is an opportunity, \\"I\\" do not hit, \\"it\\" hits all by itself.","While it may come as a profound surprise to those of us who are in the throes of an emotional or life crisis, the fact remains that the answer to virtually all of our problems resides within us already. It exist in the form of a vast reservoir of free-flowing energy that, when channeled to our muscles, can give us great strength and, when channeled to our brain, can give us great insight and understanding.","Optimism is a faith that leads to success.","Training for strength and flexibility is a must. You must use it to support your techniques. Techniques alone are no good if you don\'t support them with strength and flexibility.","A kung fu man who was really good was not proud at all. Pride emphasizes the superiority of one\'s status. There has to be fear and insecurity in pride, because when you aim at being highly esteemed and achieve such status, you automatically start to worry about losing status.","I think of myself as a human being.","It is the man that has nothing to lose or is willing to lose everything to beat you that I am afraid of. If a man is willing to lose his life to bite off my nose then I don\'t care how good I am or what I do to him- he\'s gonna get my nose.","Willing is not enough, one must apply.","To me, ultimately, martial arts means honestly expressing yourself.","The More we value things, the less we value ourselves","Either you understand or you don\'t, and that is that.","If you make an ass out of yourself, there will always be someone to ride you.","I don\'t want to do anything halfway. It has to be perfect.","When finger point at moon, don\'t look at finger or you\'ll miss the moon.","We have more faith in what we imitate than in what we create","Dedication, absolute dedication, is what keeps one ahead. A sort of \\n indomitable obsessive dedication and the realization that there is \\n no end or limit to this because life is simply an ever-growing process, \\n an ever-renewing process.","Knowledge will give you power, but character respect.","Relationship is the mirror in which you discover yourself - to be is to be related.","The best form of endurance exercise is the performance of the event.","When you fight, if it is a real fight, use every tool that you have, use your whole body. Use your fists, your legs, your fingers, your head if you have to, and hit them in every vulnerable spot, the balls, the eyes etc. to win.","What we are after is the root and not the branches. The root is the real knowledge; the branches are surface knowledge. Real knowledge breeds \'body feel\' and personal expression; surface knowledge breeds mechanical conditioning and imposing limitation and squelches creativity.","Boards don\'t hit back.","You have to create your own luck. You have to be aware of the opportunities around you and take advantage of them.","Real living is living for others.","The more relaxed the muscles are, the more energy can flow through the body. Using muscular tensions to try to \'do\' the punch or attempting to use brute force to knock someone over will only work to opposite effect.","Use karate, judo, aikido, or any style to build your counter-offensive. It will be interesting!","The doubters said, \\"Man can not fly,\\" The doers said, \\"Maybe, but we\'ll try,\\" And finally soared In the morning glow While non-believers Watched from below.","Like everyone else, you want to learn the way to win, but never to accept the way to lose - to accept defeat. To learn to die is to be liberated from it. So when tomorrow comes you must free your ambitious mind and learn the art of dying!","Now I see that I will never find the light Unless, like the candle, I am my own fuel, Consuming myself.","Put \'going the extra mile\' to work as part of one\'s daily habit","From form to formless and from finite to infinite","A self-willed man obeys a different law, the one law I, too, hold absolutely sacred the human law in himself, his own individual will.","If mere mechanical efficiency can make everyone a martial artist, then all is well. Unfortunately, combat, like freedom, is something that can not be preconceived.","The highest art is no art. The best form is no form.","Self-knowledge involves relationship. To know oneself is to study one self in action with another person. Relationship is a process of self evaluation and self revelation. Relationship is the mirror in which you discover yourself - to be is to be related.","The less effort, the faster and more powerful you will be.","Art reaches its greatest peak when devoid of self-consciousn ess.","The past is an illusion. You must learn to live in the present and accept yourself for what you are now. What you lack in flexibility and agility you must make up with knowledge and constant practice.","All knowledge leads to self-knowledge.","The unconditioned mind intuits truth.","If there is always light, you don\u2019t experience light anymore. You have to have the rhythm of light and darkness.","Ideas are the beginning of all achievement.","There are too many stars and too few actors.","Not being tense but ready. Not thinking but not dreaming. Not being set but flexible. Liberation from the uneasy sense of confinement. It is being wholly and quietly alive, aware and alert, ready for whatever may come.","How can there be methods and systems to arrive at something that is living? To that which is static, fixed, dead, there can be a way, a definite path, but not to that which is living. Do not reduce reality to a static thing and then invent methods to reach it. ...Truth has no path. Truth is living and, therefore, changing. It has no resting place, no form, no organized institution, no philosophy. When you see that, you will understand that this living thing is also what you are. You cannot express and be alive through static, put-together form, through stylized movement.","Let yourself go with dis-ease, be with it, and keep it company. This is the way to be rid of it.","Remember, Life is a journey, not a destination.","Success means doing something sincerely and wholeheartedly.","An instructor should exemplify the things he seeks to teach. It will be of great advantage if you yourself can do all you ask of your students and more.","To be certain, every day there can be a revelation or a new discovery.","Knowledge , surely, is always of time , whereas knowing is not of time. Knowledge is from a source, from accumulation, from conclusion, while knowing is a movement.","Success only means doing something sincerely and wholeheartedly. I think life is a process. Through the ages, the end of heroes is the same as ordinary men. They all died and gradually faded away in the memory of man. But when we are still alive, we have to understand ourselves, discover ourselves and express ourselves. In this way, we can progress, but we may not be successful.","The athlete who is building muscles though weight training should be very sure to work adequately on speed and flexibility at the same time. In combat, without the prior attributes, a strong man will be like the bull with its colossal strength futilely pursuing the matador or like a low-geared truck chasing a rabbit.","Can you look at a situation without naming it? Naming it, making it a word, causes fear.","Art calls for complete mastery of techniques, developed by reflection within the soul.","Give up thinking as though not giving it up. Observe techniques as though not observing.","A quality martial artist is always ready for any move, and trains oneself invincible.","The aim of art is to project an inner vision into the world.","I refer to my hands, feet and body as the tools of the trade. The hands and feet must be sharpened and improved daily to be efficient.","The founder of any branch must be more ingenious than the common man. However, if his achievement is not carried on by disciples of the same ingenuity, then things will only become formalized and get stuck in a cul-de-sac; whereby breakthrough and progress will be almost impossible.","To realize freedom the mind has to learn to look at life, which is a vast movement, without the bondage of time , for freedom lies beyond the field of consciousness care for watching, but don\'t stop and interpret \\"I am free,\\" then you\'re living in a memory of something that has gone before.","The martial arts are based upon understanding, hard work and a total comprehension of skills. Power training and the use of force are easy, but total comprehension of all of the skills of the martial arts is very difficult to achieve.","A self-willed man has no other aim than his own growth.","Nothingness cannot be defined; the softest thing cannot be snapped.","You will never get any more out of this life than you expect.","When we hold to the core, the opposite sides are the same if they are seen from the center of the moving circle. I do not experience; I am experience. I am not the subject of experience; I am that experience. I am awareness. Nothing else can be I or can exist.","My strength comes from my abdomen. It\'s the center of gravity and the source of real power.","Awareness is without choice, without demand, without anxiety; in that state of mind, there is perception.","Do not run away; let go.  Do not seek; for it will come when least expected.","Concepts vs. self-actualization. - Instead of dedicating your life to actualize a concept of what you should be like, ACTUALIZE YOURSELF. The process of maturing does not mean to become a captive of conceptualization. It is to come to the realization of what lies in our innermost selves.","A powerful athlete is not a strong athlete, but one who can exert his strength quickly. Since power equals force times speed, if the athlete learns to make faster movements he increases his power, even though the contractile pulling strength of his muscles remains unchanged. Thus, a smaller man who can swing faster may hit as hard or as far as the heavier man who swings slowly.","The moment is freedom. \u2014 I couldn\u2019t live by a rigid schedule. I try to live freely from moment to moment, letting things happen and adjusting to them.","To reach me, you must move to me. Your attack offers me an opportunity to intercept you.","You cannot force the Now. \u2014 But can you neither condemn nor justify and yet be extraordinarily alive as you walk on? You can never invite the wind, but you must leave the window open.","Everything you do, if not in a relaxed state will be done at a lesser level than you are proficient. Thus the tensed expert marksman will aim at a level less than his/her student.","If you spend too much time thinking about a thing, you\'ll never get it done.","To me, racial barriers do not exist in reality. If I say that \'everyone under the sun is a member of a universal family,\' you may think that I am bluffing and being idealistic. But if anyone still believes in racial differences, I think he is too backward and narrow in his perspective. Perhaps he still does not understand man\'s equality and love.","The more complicated and restricted the method, the less opportunity for expression of one\'s original sense of freedom.","The point is the doing of them rather than the accomplishments . There is no actor but the action; there is no experiencer but the experience.","One should be in harmony with, not in opposition to, the strength and force of the opposition. This means that one should do nothing that is not natural or spontaneous; the important thing is not to strain in any way.","Reality is apparent when one ceases to compare.","We have great work ahead of us, and it needs devotion and much, much energy. To grow, to discover, we need involvement.","The abdominal and waist region coordinate all parts of the body and act as the center or generator. Therefore, you can promote the ability to control the body\'s action and master your will more easily.","Truth has no path. Truth is living and, therefore, changing. Awareness is without choice, without demand, without anxiety; in that state of mind, there is perception. To know oneself is to study oneself in action with another person. Awareness has no frontier; it is giving of your whole being, without exclusion.","If you don\'t want to slip up tomorrow, speak the truth today.","If you want to be immortal live a life worth remembering","Do not like, do not dislike; all will then be clear. Make a hairbreadth difference and heaven and earth are set apart.","Before I studied the art, a punch to me was just like a punch, a kick just like a kick. After I learned the art, a punch was no longer a punch, a kick no longer a kick. Now that I\'ve understood the art, a punch is just like a punch, a kick just like a kick. The height of cultivation is really nothing special. It is merely simplicity; the ability to express the utmost with the minimum.","Art is the way to the absolute and to the essence of human life. The aim of art is not the one-sided promotion of spirit, soul and senses, but the opening of all human capacities \u2013 thought, feeling, will \u2013 to the life rhythm of the world of nature. So will the voiceless voice be heard and the self be brought into harmony with it.","Go toward self-actualization rather than self-image actualization... Search within... for honest self- expression.","It is not what happens that is success or failure, but what it does to the heart of man.","Styles tend to not only separate men - because they have their own doctrines and then the doctrine became the gospel truth that you cannot change. But if you do not have a style, if you just say: Well, here I am as a human being, how can I express myself totally and completely? Now, that way you won\'t create a style, because style is a crystallization . That way, it\'s a process of continuing growth.","The unfolding of the bare human soul...that is what interests me.","The perfect way is only difficult for those who pick and choose. Do not like, do not dislike; all will then be clear. Make a hairbreadth difference and heaven and earth are set apart; if you want the truth to stand clear before you, never be for or against. The struggle between \'for\' and \'against\' is the mind\'s worst disease.","It is useless to try to stir the dirt Out of the muddy water, As it will become murkier. But leave it alone, And if it should be cleared; It will become clear by itself.","To live is to express, and to express you have to create.  Creation is never merely repetition. To live is to express oneself freely in creation.","The consciousness of self is the greatest hindrance to the proper execution of all physical action.","The reward is found in the work.","In Buddhism, there is no place for using effort. Just be ordinary and nothing special. Eat your food, move your bowels, pass water and when you\'re tired go and lie down. The ignorant will laugh at me, but the wise will understand.","Ultimately the greatest help is self-help.","Don\'t get set into one form, adapt it and build your own, and let it grow, be like water.","The attitude, \'You can win if you want to badly enough,\' means that the will to win is constant. No amount of punishment, no amount of effort, no condition is too \'tough\' to take in order to win. Such an attitude can be developed only if winning is closely tied to the practitioner\'s ideals and dreams.","Success is not in reaching the destination, but in making the journey.","Action is a high road to self-confidence and esteem. Where it is open, all energies flow toward it. It comes readily to most people, and its rewards are tangible.","Maturation is the development from environmental support to self-support.","I don\'t believe in getting something for nothing.","Remember, you are expressing the techniques and not doing the techniques.","Training is one of the most neglected phases of athletics. Too much time is given to the development of skill and too little to the development of the individual for participation.","Endurance is lost rapidly if one ceases to work at its maximum.","Man, the living creature, the creating individual, is always more important than any established style or system.","With every adversity comes a blessing because a shock acts as a reminder to oneself that we must not get stale in routine.","To live is a constant process of relating, so come on out of that shell of isolation and conclusion, and relate DIRECTLY to what is being said. Bear in mind I seek neither your approval nor to influence you. So do not make up your mind as to \\"this is this\\" or \\"that is that.\\" I will be more than satisfied if you begin to learn to investigate everything yourself from now on.","When you point to the moon, what do you see in front of your finger; Your task is to feel, not to think, when you can understand that the lesson will be learned.","The Western approach to reality is mostly through theory, and theory begins by denying reality - to talk about reality, to go around reality, to catch anything that attracts our sense-intellect and abstract it away from reality itself. Thus philosophy begins by saying that the outside world is not a basic fact, that its existence can be doubted and that every proposition in which the reality of the outside world is affirmed is not an evident proposition but one that needs to be divided, dissected and analyzed. It is to stand consciously aside and try to square a circle.","The Now is indivisible. Completeness, the now, is an absence of the conscious mind to strive to divide that which is indivisible. For once the completeness of things is taken apart it is no longer complete.","Belts are only good for holding up your pants","If there is a God, he is within. You don\'t ask God to give you things, you depend on God for your inner theme.","The measure  of the moral worth of a man is his happiness. The better the man, the more happiness. Happiness is the synonym of well-being","Independent inquiry is needed in your search for truth, not dependence on anyone else\'s view or a mere book.","Art reaches its greatest peak when devoid of self-consciousness. Freedom discovers man the moment he loses concern over what impression he is making or about to make.","Meditation means to be free from all phenomena and calmness means to be internally unperturbed. There will be calmness when one is free from external objects and is not perturbed.","The world is full of people who are determined to be somebody or to give trouble. They want to get ahead, to stand out. Such ambition has no use for a gung fu man, who rejects all forms of self-assertiveness and competition","I personally do not believe in the word style. Why? Because, unless there are human beings with three arms and four legs, unless we have another group of beings on earth that are structurally different from us, there can be no different style of fighting. Why is that? Because we have two hands and two legs. ... because of styles, people are separated. They are not united together because styles become law.","Never trouble trouble till trouble troubles you. I\'ll not willingly offend, nor be easily offended.","The core of understanding lies in the individual mind, and until that is touched everything is uncertain and superficial. Truth cannot be perceived until we come to fully understand our potential and ourselves. After all, knowledge in the martial arts ultimately means self-knowledge.","The great mistake is to anticipate the outcome of the engagement; you ought not to be thinking of whether it ends in victory or defeat. Let nature take its course, and your tools will strike at the right moment.","Take what\'s useful, discard what is not.","Love is like a friendship caught on fire.","One will never get any more than he thinks he can get. YOU HAVE WHAT IT TAKES. Look back and see your progress - damn the torpedo, full speed ahead!","To be bound by traditional martial art style or styles is the way of the mindless, enslaved martial artist. But to be inspired by the traditional martial art and to achieve further heights is the way of genius.","More and more I believe in the fact that you have two hands and two legs, and the thing is how to make good use of yourself - and that\'s about it.","Art is the way to the absolute and to the essence of human life.","Voidness is that which stands right in the middle between this and that. The void is all-inclusive, having no opposite--there is nothing which it excludes or opposes. It is living void, because all forms come out of it and whoever realizes the void is filled with life and power and the love of all beings.","Don\'t be forecasting evil unless it is what you can guard against. Anxiety is good for nothing if we can\'t turn it into a defense.","If you want to do your duty properly, you should do just a little more than that.","There is no mystery about my style. My movements are simple, direct and non-classical. The extraordinary part of it lies in its simplicity. Every movement in Jeet Kune-Do is being so of itself. There is nothing artificial about it. I always believe that the easy way is the right way.","Self-will seems to be the only virtue that takes no account of man-made laws.","Understanding comes about through feeling, from moment to moment in the mirror of relationship.","If you think a thing is impossible,you\'ll only make it impossible.","The happiness that is derived from excitement is like a brilliant fire- soon it will go out.","Do not deny the classical approach, simply as a reaction, or you will have created another pattern and trapped yourself there.","For something that is static, fixed, dead, there can be a way or a definite path; but not for anything that is moving and living.","To contemplate a thing implies maintaining oneself OUTSIDE it, resolved to keep a distance between it and ourselves.","There is \\"what is\\" only when there is no comparing and to live with \\"what is\\" is to be peaceful.","Conditioning obstructs our view of reality. We do not see IT in its suchness because of our indoctrination, crooked and twisted.","Never take your eyes off your opponent, even when you bow.","Here I am as a human being...how can I express myself, totally and completely?","Linda and I aren\'t one and one. We are two halves that make a whole -- two halves fitted together are more efficient than either half would ever be alone!","If your opponent is at a distance, kick him in the groin.

Ready for whatever may come.","To me, the extraordinary aspect of martial arts lies in its simplicity. The easy way is also the right way, and martial arts is nothing at all special; the closer to the true way of martial arts, the less wastage of expression there is.","Seek freedom from the conformity of styles","\'What is\' is more important than \'what should be.\' Too many people are looking at \'what is\' from a position of thinking \'what should be\'.","Though methods play an important role in the early stage, the techniques should not be too mechanical, complex or restrictive. If we cling blindly to them, we shall eventually become bound by their limitations. Remember, you are expressing the techniques and not doing the techniques. If somebody attacks you, your response is not Technique No.1, Stance No. 2, Section 4, Paragraph 5. Instead you simply move in like sound and echo, without any deliberation. It is as though when I call you, you answer me, or when I throw you something, you catch it. It\'s as simple as that - no fuss, no mess.","Things live by moving and gain strength as they go.","Unfortunately, now in boxing people are only allowed to punch. In Judo, people are only allowed to throw. I do not despise these kinds of martial arts. What I mean is, we now find rigid forms which create differences among clans, and the world of martial art is shattered as a result.","All knowledge, is ultimately, self knowledge.","The aim of art is to project an inner vision into the world, to state in aesthetic creation the deepest psychic and personal experiences of a human being. It is to enable those experiences to be intelligible and generally recognized within the total framework of an ideal world.","I don\'t know what is the meaning of death, but I am not afraid to die - and I go on, non-stop, going forward with life. Even though I, Bruce Lee, may die some day without fulfilling all of my ambitions, I will have no regrets. I did what I wanted to do and what I\'ve done, I\'ve done with sincerity and to the best of my ability. You can\'t expect much more from life.","The key to immortality is first living a life worth remembering.","All fixed set patterns are incapable of adaptability or pliability. The truth is outside of all fixed patterns.","Don\u2019t indulge in any unnecessary, sophisticated moves","The most important thing to me is, how, in the process of learning how to use my body, can I come to understand myself ?","The knowledge and skills you have achieved are meant to be forgotten so you can float comfortably in emptiness, without obstruction.","The word \\"superstar\\" is an ilusion","Art lives where absolute freedom is, because where it is not, there can be no creativity.","You just wait. I\'m going to be the biggest Chinese Star in the world.","The second-hand artist blindly following his sensei or sifu accepts his pattern. As a result, his action is and , more importantly, his thinking become mechanical. His responses become automatic, according to set patterns, making him narrow and limited.","If one loves, one need not have an ideology of love.","Before me now there is only one real fact -- Death. The truth I have been seeking -- this truth is Death. Yet Death is also a seeker. Forever seeking me. So -- we have met at last. And I am prepared. I am at peace. Because I will conquer death with death.","The ideal is unnatural naturalness, or natural unnaturalness. I mean it is a combination of both. I mean here is natural instinct and here is control. You are to combine the two in harmony. Not if you have one to the extreme, you\'ll be very unscientific. If you have another to the extreme, you become, all of a sudden, a mechanical man No longer a human being. It is a successful combination of both. That way it is a process of continuing growth.","Jeet Kune Do favors formlessness so that it can assume all forms and since Jeet Kune Do has no style, it can fit in with all styles. As a result, Jeet Kune Do utilizes all ways and is bound by none and, likewise, uses any techniques which serve its end.","Because one does not want to be disturbed, to be made uncertain, he establishes a pattern of conduct, of thought, a pattern of relationships to man. He then becomes a slave to the pattern and takes the pattern to be the real thing.","There\'s so much myth and baloney. Like a 80-year-old man able to manhandle a 300-pounder with his little finger. Ridiculous. Or this matter of breaking bricks and boards wth the edge of your hand. Now I ask you, did you ever see a brick or a board pick a fight with anybody?","We [tend to] have more faith in what we imitate than in what we originate. We [often feel that we] cannot derive a sense of absolute certitude from anything which has its root in us. The most poignant sense of insecurity comes from standing alone; we are not alone when we imitate.","True thusness is the substance of thought, and thought is the function of true thusness. There is no thought except that of true thusness. Thusness does not move, but its motion and function are inexhaustible.","Self-knowledge is the basis of jeet kune do because it is effective not only for the individual\'s martial art but also for his life as a human being.","Life is never stagnation. It is constant movement, un-rhythmic movement, as we as constant change. Things live by moving and gain strength as they go.","What is true stillness? Stillness in movement.","I don\'t believe in different ways of fighting now. I mean, unless human beings have 3 arms and 3 legs, then we will have a different way of fighting. But basically we all have two arms and two legs so that is why I believe there should be only one way of fighting and that is no way.","I did what I came here to do. What I\'ve done I\'ve done with sincerity and to the best of my ability. You can\'t expect much more from life.","Finally, a Jeet Kune Do man who says Jeet Kune Do is exclusively Jeet Kune Do is simply not with it. He is still hung up on his self-closing resistance, in this case anchored down to reactionary pattern, and naturally is still bound by another modified pattern and can move within its limits. He has not digested the simple fact that truth exists outside all molds; pattern and awareness is never exclusive. Again let me remind you Jeet Kune Do is just a name used, a boat to get one across, and once across it is to be discarded and not to be carried on one\'s back.","The height of cultivation always runs to simplicity ... the ability to express the utmost with the minimum. It is the halfway cultivation that leads to ornamentation.","I hope martial artists are more interested in the root of martial arts and not the different decorative branches, flowers or leaves. It is futile to argue as to which leaf, which design of branches, or which attractive flower you like; when you understand the root, you understand all its blossoming.","Good technique includes quick changes, great variety and speed. It may be a system of reversals much like a concept of God and the Devil. In the speed of events, which one is really in charge? Do they change places with lightning speed? The Chinese believe so. To put the heart of the martial arts in your own heart and have it be a part of you means total comprehension.","I do not fear the man who practices 1,000 kicks one time each. I fear the man who practices 1 kick 1,000 times.","I hope martial artists are more interested in the root of martial arts and not the different decorative branches, flowers or leaves.","Jeet Kune Do: it\'s just a name; don\'t fuss over it.

After spending many hours of meditation and practice, I gave up and went sailing alone in a junk. On the sea I thought of all my past training and got mad at myself and punched the water! Right then\u2014at that moment\u2014a thought suddenly struck me; was not this water the very essence of gung fu? Hadn\u2019t this water just now illustrated to me the principle of gung fu? I struck it but it did not suffer hurt. Again I struck it with all of my might\u2014yet it was not wounded! I then tried to grasp a handful of it but this proved impossible. This water, the softest substance in the world and what could be contained in the smallest jar, only seemed weak. In reality, it could penetrate the hardest substance in the world. That was it! I wanted to be like the nature of water. Suddenly a bird flew by and cast it\u2019s reflection on the water. Right then as I was absorbing myself with the lesson of the water, another mystic sense of hidden meaning revealed itself to me; should not the thoughts and emotions I had when in front of an opponent pass like the reflection of the bird flying over the water? This was exactly what Professor Yip meant by being detached\u2014not being without emotion or feeling, but being one in whom feeling was not sticky or blocked. Therefore in order to control myself I must first accept myself by going with and not against my nature. I lay on the boat and felt that I had united with Tao; I had become one with nature. I just laid there and let the boat drift freely according to its own will. For at that moment I had achieved a state of inner feeling in which opposition had become mutually cooperative instead of mutually exclusive, in which there was no longer any conflict in my mind. The whole world to me was as one.","The mind must be emancipated from old habits, prejudices, restrictive thought processes and even ordinary thought itself.","On learning. \u2014 Learning is discovery, the discovery of the cause of our ignorance. However, the best way of learning is not the computation of information. Learning is discovering, uncovering what is there in us. When we discover, we are uncovering our own ability, our own eyes, in order to find our potential, to see what is going on, to discover how we can enlarge our lives, to find means at our disposal that will let us cope with a difficult situation. And all this, I maintain, is taking place in the here and now.","To Bruce Lee, philosophy was not the professional playground of academics, but every human being\u2019s gateway to the greatest adventure of the human spirit. It illuminated the frontiers of human possibility and obliterated the shadows of doubt and insecurity. Unlike others, content to follow, Bruce Lee insisted upon charting his own course toward truth, and he encouraged those who wished to share his insights to do likewise. While Lee was a champion of individual rights and individual development, both of which stress the sovereignty of the individual as an end in himself, he also spoke to something deeper\u2014the commonality of all human beings and the removal of such artificial barriers to true brotherhood as nationality, ethnicity, and class structure, so that human beings could live together peaceably as independent equals.

If the dancer has any idea at all of displaying his art well, he ceases to be a good dancer, for his mind stops with every movement he goes through. In all things, it is important to forget your mind and become one with the work at hand. When the mind is tied up, it feels inhibited in every move it makes and nothing will be accomplished with any sense of spontaneity. The wheel revolves when it is not too tightly attached to the axle. When it is too tight, it will never move on. As the Zen saying goes: \u201cInto a soul absolutely free from thoughts and emotion, even the tiger finds no room to insert its fierce claws. In chi sao the mind is devoid of all fear, inferiority complexes, viscous feeling, etc., and is free from all forms of attachment, and it is master of itself, it knows no hindrances, no inhibitions, no stoppages, no clogging, no stickiness.

When it is nowhere it is everywhere. When it occupies one tenth, it is absent in the other nine tenths. Let the gung fu man discipline himself to have the mind go on its own way, instead of trying deliberately to confine it somewhere. Therefore, during chi sao, you should have nothing purposely designed, nothing consciously calculated, no anticipation, no expectation. In short, you should be standing there like a dead man. To be conscious is characteristic of the human mind as distinguished from the mind of the lower animals. But when the mind becomes conscious of its doings, it ceases to be instinctual and its commands are colored with calculations and deliberations\u2014which means that the connection between itself and the limbs is no longer direct because the identity of the commander and his executive agent is lost.

It is not, \u201cI am doing this, but rather, an inner realization that \u201cthis is happening through me,\u201d or \u201cit is doing this for me.\u201d The consciousness of self is the greatest hindrance to the proper execution of all physical action.\u201d","If you love life, don\'t waste time; for time is what life is made up of.","Enrich your understanding. \u2014 Don\u2019t be in a hurry to \u201cfix things; rather, enrich your understanding in the ever-going process of discovery and finding more the cause of your ignorance.\u201d","Insight is not a quality that comes naturally, rather it is a characteristic that is nurtured through intelligent decision-making. It was through the process of applying his intelligence that Bruce developed deep insights into living the Tao of gung fu. He made passionate inquiry into every aspect of living the martial way, he respected traditional beliefs, but was not bound by unexamined tradition, he created his own philosophical outlook on life, and lived it and breathed it every moment of every day\u2014","In solitude you are least alone. \u2014 Loneliness is only an opportunity to cut adrift and find yourself.

Only training can produce results (I can help you with this). If you do not consider a few minutes of training worthwhile, and think the chance of assault is small, you are one of those people who encourages thugs to attack, and no one can help you should an emergency arise.","the whip of the arm is caused by turning the body away from the arm until the range of movement in the shoulder joint is completely used. Then, the arm must turn with the body. Executed quickly, this causes the arm to whip forward as if released from a bow.","Some martial arts are very popular, real crowd pleasers, because they look good, have smooth techniques. but beware.They are like a wine that has been watered. A diluted wine is not a real wine, nto a good wine, hardly the genuine article. Some martial arts don\u2019t look so good, but you know that they have a kick, a tang, a genuine taste. They are like olives. The taste may be strong and bittersweet. The flavour lasts. You cultivate a taste for them. NO one ever developed a taste for diluted wine","The good man wins a victory and then stops; he will not go on to acts of violent winning, he boasteth not, he will not triumph, he shows no arrogance.

But character can get you respect.","The unfolding of the bare human soul... that is what interests me.","A wise man can always be found alone. A weak man can always be found in crowd.","Love is mathematically just. \u2014 Love, and you shall be loved \u2014 all love is mathematically just, as much as the two sides of an algebraic equation.","Life is a process, not a goal; a means but not an end; a constant movement rather than an established pattern.","The importance of acknowledging your love. \u2014 A very important person I like to thank. A quality human being in her own right \u2014 giving, loving, stalwart, understanding this animal, Bruce Lee. And letting him simply be. My companion in our separate but intertwined pathways of growth, a definite enricher of my life, the woman I love; and \u2014 fortunately for me \u2014 my wife. I cannot leave this paragraph without saying that Linda, thanks for the day when, at the University of Washington, Bruce Lee had the honor to meet you.","I am learning to understand rather than immediately judge or to be judged. I cannot blindly follow the crowd and accept their approach. I will not allow myself to indulge in the usual manipulating game of role creation. Fortunately for me, my self-knowledge has transcended that and I have come to understand that life is best to be lived and not to be conceptualized. I am happy because I am growing daily and I am honestly not knowing where the limit lies. To be certain, every day there can be a revelation or a new discovery. I treasure the memory of the past misfortunes. It has added more to my bank of fortitude.","Long-term consistency trumps shot-term intensity.","Las herramientas, tus armas naturales, tienen un doble prop\xf3sito:1.- Destruir a tu rival frente a ti, el aniquilamiento de cosas que est\xe1n en el camino de la paz, en el de la justicia y la humanidad.2.- Destruir tus propios impulsos resultantes del instinto de conservaci\xf3n.

What makes an action bad or good?","The spirit is strengthened in sorrow. \u2014 Happiness is good for the body, but sorrow strengthens the spirit.","Let the spiritual grow up through the common. \u2014 Live content with small means; seek elegance rather than luxury, and refinement rather than fashion. Be worthy, not respectable, wealthy, not rich; study hard, think quietly, talk gently, act frankly; bear all cheerfully, do all bravely, await occasions, hurry never. In a word, let the spiritual, unbidden and unconscious, grow up through the common.","On the joy of exercise. \u2014 I really dig exercise. When I\u2019m jogging early in the morning, boy! It\u2019s sure refreshing. Although Hong Kong is one of the most crowded places in the world, I\u2019m surprised how peaceful it can be in the morning. Sure, there are people, but I become oblivious to them while I am running.","True fortune is a wonderful spouse. \u2014 I think when a couple marry, they either go into heaven or live in hell.

So if you are in the NOW, you can\u2019t be anxious, because your excitement flows immediately into ongoing spontaneous activity.","The more we value things, the less we value our selves. \u2014 We should devote ourselves to being self-sufficient and must not depend upon the external rating by others for our happiness. So it is true that the more we value things, the less we value our self. The more we depend upon others for esteem, the less we are self-sufficient.","You cannot clear muddied water with your hand. \u2014 Who is there that can make muddy water clear? But if allowed to remain still, it will become clear of itself. Who is there that can secure a state of absolute repose? But keep calm and let time go on, and the state of repose will gradually arrest.","It\u2019s not daily increase but daily decrease\u2014hack away the unessentials!","Relaxation is a physical state, but it is controlled by the mental state.

Hell, isn\u2019t it knowing above all, that, indeed, one is the captain of one\u2019s soul, the master of one\u2019s life? Now what causes such realization and, consequently, brings about a change in one\u2019s behavior?
