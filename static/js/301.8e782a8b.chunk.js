In that space is our power to choose our response. In our response lies our growth and our freedom.","When we are no longer able to change a situation - we are challenged to change ourselves.","Life is not primarily a quest for pleasure, as Freud believed, or a quest for power, as Alfred Adler taught, but a quest for meaning. The greatest task for any person is to find meaning in his or her own life.","We who lived in concentration camps can remember the men who walked through the huts comforting others, giving away their last piece of bread. They may have been few in number, but they offer sufficient proof that everything can be taken from a man but one thing: the last of the human freedoms -- to choose one\'s attitude in any given set of circumstances, to choose one\'s own way.","Decisions, not conditions, determine what a man is.","Life is never made unbearable by circumstances, but only by lack of meaning and purpose.","When a person can\u2019t find a deep sense of meaning, they distract themselves with pleasure.","Everything can be taken from a man but one thing: the last of human freedoms - to choose one\'s attitude in any given set of circumstances, to choose one\'s own way.","Success, like happiness, is the unexpected side effect of one\'s personal dedication to a cause greater than oneself.","The one thing you can\'t take away from me is the way I choose to respond to what you do to me.","Our greatest human freedom is that, despite whatever our physical situation is in life, WE ARE ALWAYS FREE TO CHOOSE OUR THOUGHTS!","Don\'t aim at success \u2014 the more you aim at it and make it a target, the more you are going to miss it. For success, like happiness, cannot be pursued; it must ensue, and it only does so as the unintended side-effect of one\'s personal dedication to a cause greater than oneself or as the by-product of one\'s surrender to a person other than oneself. Happiness must happen, and the same holds for success: you have to let it happen by not caring about it. I want you to listen to what your conscience commands you to do and go on to carry it out to the best of your knowledge. Then you will live to see that in the long run \u2014 in the long run, I say \u2014 success will follow you precisely because you had forgotten to think of it.","We must never forget that we may also find meaning in life even when confronted with a hopeless situation, when facing a fate that cannot be changed. For what then matters is to bear witness to the uniquely human potential at its best, which is to transform a personal tragedy into a triumph, to turn one\'s predicament into a human achievement. When we are no longer able to change a situation-just think of an incurable disease such as inoperable cancer-we are challenged to change ourselves.","Our greatest freedom is the freedom to choose our attitude.","What is to give light must endure burning.","Being tolerant does not mean that I share another one\'s belief. But it does mean that I acknowledge another one\'s right to believe, and obey, his own conscience.","Either belief in God is unconditional or it is no belief at all.","You don\'t create your mission in life - you detect it.","There are two races of men in this world but only these two: the race of the decent man and the race of the indecent man.","The more one forgets one\u2019s own self, the more human the person becomes.","It isn\'t the past which holds us back, it\'s the future; and how we undermine it, today.","It did not really matter what we expected from life, but rather what life expected from us. We needed to stop asking about the meaning of life, and instead to think of ourselves as those who were being questioned by life\u2014daily and hourly. Our answer must consist, not in talk and meditation, but in right action and in right conduct. Life ultimately means taking the responsibility to find the right answer to its problems and to fulfill the tasks which it constantly sets for each individual.","Each of us carries a unique spark of the divine, and each of us is also an inseparable part of the web of life.","Life asks of every individual a contribution, and it is up to that individual to discover what it should be","The meaning of my life is to help others find meaning in theirs.","The attempt to develop a sense of humor and to see things in a humorous light is some kind of a trick learned while mastering the art of living.","One evening, when we were already resting on the floor of our hut, dead tired, soup bowls in hand, a fellow prisoner rushed in and asked us to run out to the assembly grounds and see the wonderful sunset. Standing outside we saw sinister clouds glowing in the west and the whole sky alive with clouds of ever-changing shapes and colors, from steel blue to blood red. The desolate grey mud huts provided a sharp contrast, while the puddles on the muddy ground reflected the glowing sky. Then, after minutes of moving silence, one prisoner said to another, \\"How beautiful the world could be.","Just as a small fire is extinguished by the storm whereas a large fire is enhanced by it - likewise a weak faith is weakened by predicament and catastrophes whereas a strong faith is strengthened by them.","A man who becomes conscious of the responsibility he bears toward a human being who affectionately waits for him, or to an unfinished work, will never be able to throw away his life. He knows the \\"why\\" for his existence, and will be able to bear almost any \\"how.\\"","For the first time in my life I saw the truth as it is set into song by so many poets, proclaimed as the final wisdom by so many thinkers. The truth - that Love is the ultimate and highest goal to which man can aspire. Then I grasped the meaning of the greatest secret that human poetry and human thought and belief have to impart: The salvation of man is through love and in love.","Live as if you were living a second time, and as though you had acted wrongly the first time.","To be sure, man\'s search for meaning may arouse inner tension rather than inner equilibrium. However, precisely such tension is an indispensable prerequisite of mental health. There is nothing in the world, I venture to say, that would so effectively help one to survive even the worst conditions as the knowledge that there is a meaning in one\'s life. There is much wisdom in the words of Nietzsche: \\"He who has a why to live for can bear almost any how","Love goes very far beyond the physical person of the beloved. It finds its deepest meaning in its spiritual being, his inner self. Whether or not he is actually present, whether or not he is still alive at all, ceases somehow to be of importance.","In some ways suffering ceases to be suffering at the moment it finds a meaning, such as the meaning of a sacrifice.","No one can become fully aware of the very essence of another human being until he loves him. By his love he is enabled to see the essential traits and features in the beloved person; and even more, he sees that which is potential in him, which is not yet actualized. Furthermore, by his love, the loving person enables the beloved person to actualize these potentialities. By making him aware of what he can be and what he should become, he makes these potentialities come true.","The point is not what we expect from life, but rather what life expects from us.","The one thing you can\u2019t take away from me is the way I choose to respond to what you do to me. The last of one\u2019s freedoms is to choose ones attitude in any given circumstance.","An abnormal reaction to an abnormal situation is normal behavior.","Even when it is not fully attained, we become better by striving for a higher goal.","Every human being has the freedom to change at any instant.","The quest for meaning is the key to mental health and human flourishing","No man should judge unless he asks himself in absolute honesty whether in a similar situation he might not have done the same.","If we take a man as he is, we make him worse, but if we take man as he should be we make him capable of becoming what he can be.","Man\u2019s main concern is not to gain pleasure or to avoid pain but rather to see a meaning in his life.","In times of crisis, people reach for meaning. Meaning is strength. Our survival may depend on our seeking and finding it.","Man is not fully conditioned and determined but rather determines himself whether he gives in to conditions or stands up to them. In other words, man is ultimately self-determining. Man does not simply exist but always decides what his existence will be, what he will become in the next moment.","Humor was another of the soul\'s weapons in the fight for self-preservation.","Between stimulus and response is the freedom to choose.","We can discover this meaning in life in three different ways: 1. by doing a deed; 2. by experiencing a value; and 3. by suffering.","Nothing is likely to help a person overcome or endure troubles than the consciousness of having a task in life.","...being human always points, and is directed, to something, or someone, other than oneself\u2014be it meaning to fulfill or another human being to encounter. The more one forgets himself\u2014by giving himself to a cause to serve or another person to love\u2014the more human he is and the more he actualizes himself.... What is called self-actualization is not an attainable aim at all, for the simple reason that the more one would strive for it, the more he would miss it. In other words, self-actualization is possible only as a side-effect of self-transcendence.","To suffer unecessarily is masochistic rather than heroic.","For the world is in a bad state, but everything will become still worse unless each of us does his best.","God is the partner of your most intimate soliloquies","But there was no need to be ashamed of tears, for tears bore witness that a man had the greatest of courage, the courage to suffer.","Despair is suffering without meaning.","One should not search for an abstract meaning of life ... Life can be made meaningful in a threefold way: first, through what we give to life ... second, by what we take from the world ... third, through the stand we take toward a fate we no longer can change.","Only to the extent that someone is living out this self transcendence of human existence, is he truly human or does he become his true self. He becomes so, not by concerning himself with his self\'s actualization, but by forgetting himself and giving himself, overlooking himself and focusing outward.","Success is total self-acceptance.","For the meaning of life differs from man to man, from day to day and from hour to hour. What matters, therefore, is not the meaning of life in general but rather the specific meaning of a person\'s life at a given moment.","Everyone has his own specific vocation or mission in life; everyone must carry out a concrete assignment that demands fulfillment. Therein he cannot be replaced, nor can his life be repeated, thus, everyone\'s task is unique as his specific opportunity to implement it.","When a man cannot find meaning, he numbs himself with pleasure.","The last freedom is choosing your attitude.","Self-actualization cannot be attained if it is made an end in itself,  but only as a side effect of self-transcendence.","View your life from your funeral, looking back at your life experiences, what have you accomplished? What would you have wanted to accomplish but didn\'t? What were the happy moments? What were the sad? What would you do again, and what you wouldn\'t","Then I grasped the meaning of the greatest secret that human poetry and human thought and belief have to impart: The salvation of man is through love and in love.","For success, like happiness, cannot be pursued; it must ensue, and it only does so as the unintended side-effect of one\'s personal dedication to a cause greater than oneself or as the by-product of one\'s surrender to a person other than oneself.","I am absolutely convinced that the gas chambers of Auschwitz, Treblinka, and Maidanek were ultimately prepared not in some ministry or other in Berlin, but rather at the desks and in the lecture halls of nihilistic scientists and philosophers.","Pain is only bearable if we know it will end, not if we deny it exists.","It is here that we encounter the central theme of existentialism: to live is to suffer, to survive is to find meaning in the suffering.","Man can only find meaning for his existence in something outside himself.","A human being is not one thing among others; things determine each other, but man is ultimately self-determining. What he becomes - within the limits of endowment and environment- he has made out of himself. In the concentration camps, for example, in this living laboratory and on this testing ground, we watched and witnessed some of our comrades behave like swine while others behaved like saints. Man has both potentialities within himself; which one is actualized depends on decisions but not on conditions.","Ever more people today have the means to live, but no meaning to live for.","You can take away my wife, you can take away my children, you can strip me of my clothes and my freedom, but there is one thing no person can ever take away from me - and that is my freedom to choose how I will react to what happens to me!","The way in which a man accepts his fate and all the suffering it entails, the way in which he takes up his cross, gives him ample opportunity \u2014 even under the most difficult circumstances \u2014 to add a deeper meaning to his life. It may remain brave, dignified and unselfish. Or in the bitter fight for self preservation he may forget his human dignity and become no more than an animal","As a professor in two fields, neurology and psychiatry, I am fully aware of the extent to which man is subject to biological, psychological and sociological conditions. But in addition to being a professor in two fields I am a survivor of four camps - concentration camps, that is - and as such I also bear witness to the unexpected extent to which man is capable of defying and braving even the worst conditions conceivable.","Man\'s inner strength may raise him above his outward fate.","Sunday neurosis, that kind of depression which afflicts people who become aware of the lack of content in their lives when the rush of the busy week is over and the void within themselves becomes manifest.","This is the core of the human spirit ... If we can find something to live for - if we can find some meaning to put at the center of our lives - even the worst kind of suffering becomes bearable.","When a man finds that it is his destiny to suffer, he will have to accept his suffering as his task; his single and unique task. He will have to acknowledge the fact that even in suffering he is unique and alone in the universe. No one can relieve him of his suffering or suffer in his place. His unique opportunity lies in the way in which he bears his burden.","If there is meaning in life at all, then there must be meaning in suffering.","Logotherapy . . . considers man as a being whose main concern consists in fulfilling a meaning and in actualizing values, rather than in the mere gratification and satisfaction of drives and instincts.","Ultimate freedom is a man\'s right to choose his attitude.","A human being is a deciding being.","Love goes very far beyond the physical person of the beloved.","The meaning of our existence is not invented by ourselves, but rather detected.","What was really needed was a fundamental change in our attitude toward life. We had to learn ourselves and, furthermore, we had to teach the despairing men, that it did not really matter what we expected from life, but rather what life expected from us.","I would say that our patients never really despair because of any suffering in itself! Instead, their despair stems in each instance from a doubt as to whether suffering is meaningful. Man is ready and willing to shoulder any suffering as soon and as long as he can see a meaning in it.","Love is the only way to grasp another human being in the innermost core of his personality","Each man is questioned by life; and he can only answer to life by answering for his own life; to life he can only respond by being responsible.","The more one forgives himself - by giving himself to a cause to serve or another person to love - the more human he is and the more he actualizes himself.","Love is the only way to grasp another human being in the innermost core of his personality. No one can become fully aware of the very essence of another human being unless he loves him. By his love he is enabled to see the essential traits and features.","Man\'s search for meaning is the chief motivation of his life.","The existential vacuum manifests itself mainly in a state of boredom.","Most men in a concentration camp believed that the real opportunities of life had passed. Yet, in reality, there was an opportunity and a challenge. One could make a victory of those experiences, turning life into an inner triumph, or one could ignore the challenge and simply vegetate, as did a majority of the prisoners.","What man actually needs is not a tensionless state but rather the striving and struggling for some goal worthy of him. What he needs is not the discharge of tension at any cost, but the call of a potential meaning waiting to be fulfilled by him.","Those who know how close the connection is between the state of mind of a man-his courage and hope, or lack of them-and the state of immunity of his body will understand that the sudden loss of hope and courage can have a deadly effect. The ultimate cause of my friend\'s death was that the expected liberation did not come and he was severely disappointed.","I do not forget any good deed done to me & I do not carry a grudge for a bad one.","Once an individual\'s search for meaning is successful, it not only renders him happy but also gives him the capability to cope with suffering","The last of the human freedoms \u2014 to choose one\'s attitude in any given set of circumstances, to choose one\'s own way.","Because of social pressure, individualism is rejected by most people in favor of conformity. Thus the individual relies mainly upon the actions of others and neglects the meaning of his own personal life. Hence he sees his own life as meaningless and falls into the \u201cexistential vacuum\u201d feeling inner void. Progressive automation causes increasing alcoholism, juvenile delinquency, and suicide.","And I quoted from Nietzsche: That which does not kill me, makes me stronger.","What you have experienced, no power on earth can take from you.","Happiness cannot be pursued; it must ensue.","No one can become fully aware of the very essence of another human being unless he loves him.","What will it matter to him if he notices that he is growing old? Has he any reason to envy the young people whom he sees, or wax nostalgic over his own lost youth? What reasons has he to envy a young person? For the possibilities that a young person has, the future which is in store for him? \\"No, thank you,\\" he will think. \\"Instead of possibilities, I have realities in my past, not only the reality of work done and love loved, but of sufferings bravely suffered. These sufferings are even the things of which I am most proud, though these things are things that cannot inspire envy.\\"","Life can be pulled by goals just as surely as it can be pushed by drives.","Consider a movie: it consists of thousands upon thousands of individual pictures, and each of them makes sense and carries a meaning, yet the meaning of the whole film cannot be seen before its last sequence is shown. However, we cannot understand the whole film without having first understood each of its components, each of the individual pictures. Isn\'t it the same with life? Doesn\'t the final meaning of life, too, reveal itself, it at all, only at its end, on the verge of death?","For what then matters is to bear witness to the uniquely human potential at its best, which is to transform a personal tragedy into a triumph, to turn one\u2019s predicament into a human achievement.","I do the unpleasant tasks before I do the pleasant ones.","There is nothing in the world, I venture to say, that would so effectively help one to survive even the worst conditions as the knowledge that there is a meaning in one\'s life.","View life as a series of movie frames, the ending and meaning may not be apparent until the very end of the movie, and yet, each of the hundreds of individual frames has meaning within the context of the whole movie.","Man does not simply exist but always decides what his existence will be, what he will become the next moment. By the same token, every human being has the freedom to change at any instant.","I understood how a man who has nothing left in this world may still know bliss, be it only for a brief moment, in the contemplation of his beloved. In a position of utter desolation, when a man cannot express himself in positive action, when his only achievement may consist in enduring his sufferings in the right way - an honorable way - in such a position man can, through loving contemplation of the image he carries of his beloved, achieve fulfillment.","Our attitude towards what has happened to us in life is the important thing to recognize. Once hopeless, my life is now hope-full, but it did not happen overnight. The last of human freedoms, to choose one\'s attitude in any given set of circumstances, is to choose one\'s own way.","It is this spiritual freedom - which cannot be taken away - \\n that makes life meaningful and purposeful.","Suffering presents us with a challenge: to find our goals and purpose in our lives that make even the worst situation worth living through.","Man ultimately decides for himself! And in the end, education must be education towards the ability to decide","If there is meaning in life at all, then there must be a meaning in suffering. Suffering is an ineradicable part of life, even as fate and death. Without suffering and death human life cannot be complete.","Since Auschwitz we know what man is capable of. And since Hiroshima we know what is at stake.","I try to do everything as soon as possible, and not at the last moment. This ensures that, when I am overburdened with work, I will not face the added pressure of knowing that something is still to be done.","Ultimately, man should not ask what the meaning of his life is, but rather he must recognize that it is he who is asked.","Our generation is realistic, for we have come to know man as he really is. After all, man is that being who invented the gas chambers of Auschwitz; however, he is also that being who entered those gas chambers upright, with the Lord\'s Prayer or the Shema Yisrael on his lips.","The angels are lost in perpetual contemplation of an infinite glory.","I never would have made it if I could not have laughed. It lifted me momentarily out of this horrible situation, just enough to make it livable.","The last of human freedoms - the ability to chose one\'s attitude especially an attitude of gratitude in a given set of circumstances especially in difficult circumstances.","When a man finds that it is his destiny to suffer, he will have to accept his suffering as his task. . . . He will have to acknowledge the fact that even in suffering he is unique and alone in the universe. No one can relieve him of his suffering or suffer in his place. His unique opportunity lies in the way in which he bears his burden.","Man is not fully conditioned and determined but rather determines himself whether he gives in to conditions or stands up to them.","In a last violent protest against the hopelessness of imminent death, I sensed my spirit piercing through the enveloping gloom. I felt it transcend that hopeless, meaningless world, and from somewhere I heard a victorious \\"Yes\\" in answer to my question of the existence of an ultimate purpose. At that moment a light was lit in a distant farmhouse, which stood on the horizon as if painted there, in the midst of the miserable gray of a dawning morning in Bavaria. \\"Et lux in tenebris lucet\\"-and the light shineth in the darkness.","I shall never forget how I was roused one night by the groans of a fellow prisoner, who threw himself about in his sleep, obviously having a horrible nightmare. Since I had always been especially sorry for people who suffered from fearful dreams or deliria, I wanted to wake the poor man. Suddenly I drew back the hand which was ready to shake him, frightened at the thing I was about to do. At that moment I became intensely conscious of the fact that no dream, no matter how horrible, could be as bad as the reality of the camp which surrounded us, and to which I was about to recall him.","Love is the ultimate and the highest goal to which man can aspire.","At such a moment, it is not the physical pain which hurts the most (and this applies to adults as much as to punished children); it is the mental agony caused by the injustice, the unreasonableness of it all.","Human kindness can be found in all groups, even those which as a whole it would be easy to condemn.","Ironically enough, in the same way that fear brings to pass what one is afraid of, likewise a forced intention makes impossible what one forcibly wishes... Pleasure is, and must remain, a side-effect or by-product, and is destroyed and spoiled to the degree to which it is made a goal in itself.","At any moment, man must decide, for better or for worse, what will be the monument of his existence.","I want you to listen to what your conscience commands you to do and go on to carry it out to the best of your knowledge. Then you will live to see that in the long run- in the long run, I say! - success will follow you precisely because you had forgotten to think of it.","Most important, however, is the third avenue to meaning in life: even the helpless victim of a\\nhopeless situation, facing a fate he cannot change, may rise above himself, may grow beyond\\nhimself, and by so doing change himself. He may turn a personal tragedy into a triumph.","It is always important to have something yet to do in life.","Life requires of man spiritual elasticity, so that he may temper his efforts to the chances that are offered.","As for the concept of collective guilt, I personally think that it is totally unjustified to hold one person responsible for the behavior of another person or a collective of persons.","A life of short duration...could be so rich in joy and love that it could contain more meaning than a life lasting eighty years.","No one can take away my freedom to choose how I will react.","Sleep [is like] a dove which has landed near one\'s hand and stays there as long as one does not pay any attention to it.","Pain from problems and disappointments, etc., is inevitable in life, but suffering is a choice determined by whether you choose to compare your experience and pain to something better and therefore feel unlucky and bitter or to something worse and therefore feel lucky and grateful!","Life ultimately means taking the responsibility to find the right answer to its problems and to fulfill the tasks which it constantly sets for each individual.","There are only two races, the decent and the indecent.","If architects want to strengthen a decrepit arch, they increase the load which is laid upon it, for thereby the parts are joined more firmly together. So if therapists wish to foster their patients\' mental health, they should not be afraid to increase that load through a reorientation toward the meaning of one\'s life.","In his creative work the artist is dependent on sources and resources deriving from the spiritual unconscious.","I had wanted simply to convey to the reader by way of concrete example that life holds a potential meaning under any conditions, even the most miserable ones. And I thought that if the point were demonstrated in a situation as extreme as that in a concentration camp, my book might gain a hearing. I therefore felt responsible for writing down what I had gone through, for I thought it might be helpful to people who are prone to despair.","[Speaking of his experience in a concentration camp:] As we said before, any attempt to restore a man\'s inner strength in the camp had first to succeed in showing him some future goal...Woe to him who saw no more sense in his life, no aim, no purpose, and therefore no point in carrying on. He was soon lost.","Happiness cannot be attained by wanting to be happy - it must come as the unintended consequence of working for a goal greater than oneself.","Instead of possibilities, I have realities in my past, not only the reality of work done and of love loved, but of sufferings bravely suffered. These sufferings are even the things of which I am most proud, though these are things which cannot inspire envy.","Set me like a seal upon thy heart, love is as strong as death.","It said to me, \'I am here \u2014 I am here \u2014 I am life, eternal life.\'","One can choose one\'s attitude in any given set of circumstances.","Austrian public-opinion pollsters recently reported that those held in highest esteem by most of the people interviewed are neither the great artists nor the great scientists, neither the great statesmen nor the great sport figures, but those who master a hard lot with their heads held high.","To the European, it is a characteristic of the American culture that, again and again, one is commanded and ordered to \'be happy.\' But happiness cannot be pursued; it must ensue. One must have a reason to \'be happy.\' Once the reason is found, however, one becomes happy automatically. As we see, a human being is not one in pursuit of happiness but rather in search of a reason to become happy, last but not least, through actualizing the potential meaning inherent and dormant in a given situation.","Everywhere man is confronted with fate , with a chance of achieving something through his own suffering.","Challenging the meaning of life is the truest expression of the state of being human.","Fear may come true that which one is afraid of.","Thus, human existence-at least as long as it has not been neurotically distorted-is always directed to something, or someone, other than itself, be it a meaning to fulfill or another human being to encounter lovingly.","Ultimately, we are not subject to the conditions that confront us; rather, these conditions are subject to our decision ... we must decide whether we will face up or give in, whether or not we will let ourselves be determined by the conditions.","Sports allow men to build up situations of emergency. What he then demands of himself is unnecessary achievement - and unnecessary sacrifice. He artificially creates the tension that he has been spared by affluent society.","To draw an analogy: a man\'s suffering is similar to the behavior of a gas. If a certain quantity of gas is pumped into an empty chamber, it will fill the chamber completely and evenly, no matter how big the chamber. Thus suffering completely fills the human soul and conscious mind, no matter whether the suffering is great or little. Therefore the \\"size\\" of human suffering is absolutely relative.","It is well known that humor, more than anything else in the human make-up, can afford an aloofness and an ability to rise above any situation, even if only for a few seconds.","It is a peculiarity of man that he can only live by looking to \\n the future...And this is his salvation in the most difficult moments \\n of his existence, although he sometimes has to force his mind to \\n the task.","Freedom is in danger of degenerating into mere arbitrariness unless it is lived in terms of responsibleness. That is why I recommend that the Statue of Liberty on the East Coast be supplemented by a Statue of Responsibility on the West Coast.","The salvation of man is through love and in love.","I recommend that the Statue of Liberty be supplemented by a Statue of Responsibility on the west coast.","It is not freedom from conditions, but it is freedom to take a stand toward the conditions.","We cannot, after all, judge a biography by its length, by the number of pages in it; we must judge by the richness of the contents...Sometimes the \'unfinisheds\' are among the most beautiful symphonies.","When we are not any lengthier capable to alter a predicament, we\'re challenged to alter ourselves","What is demanded of man is not, as some existential philosophers teach, to endure the meaninglessness of life, but rather to bear his incapacity to grasp its unconditional meaningfulness in rational terms.","The transitoriness of our existence in now way makes it meaningless. But it does constitute our responsibleness; for everything hinges upon our realizing the essentially transitory possibilities.","We had to learn...that it did not really matter what we expected from life but rather what life expected from us.","In psychiatry there is a certain condition known as delusion of reprieve. The condemned man, immediately before his execution, gets the illusion that he might be reprieved at the very last minute. No one could yet grasp the fact that everything would be taken away. all we possessed, literally, was our naked existence.","Fundamentally, therefore, any man can, even under such circumstances, decide what shall become of him\u2014mentally and spiritually. He may retain his human dignity even in a concentration camp.","I understood how a man who has nothing left in this world still may know bliss, be it only for a brief moment, in the contemplation of his beloved.","It is the pursuit of happiness that thwarts happiness.","Man is capable of changing the world for the better if possible, and of changing himself for the better if necessary.","A man\'s concern, even his despair, over the worthwhileness of life is an existential distress but by no means a mental disease.","Happiness must ensue. It cannot be pursued","Man\'s last freedom is his freedom to choose how he will react in any given situation","Now, it is my contention that the deneuroticization of humanity requires a rehumanization of psychotherapy.","It is a peculiarity of man that he can only live by looking to the future.",". . . nothing could touch the strength of my love, and the thoughts of my beloved. Had I known then that my wife was dead, I think that I still would have given myself, undisturbed by that knowledge, to the contemplation of that image, and that my mental conversation with her would have been just as vivid and just as satisfying. \\"Set me like a seal upon thy heart, love is as strong as death.\\"","Our main motivation for living is our will to find meaning in life.","Woe to him who saw no more sense in his life, no aim, no purpose, and therefore no point in carrying on.","Such a value system might be responsible for the fact that the burden of unavoidable unhappiness is increased by unhappiness about being unhappy.","A man who could not see the end of his\\"provisional existence\\" was not able to aim at an ultimate goal in life.","But my mind clung to my wife\'s image, imagining it with an uncanny acuteness. I heard her answering me, saw her smile, her frank and encouraging look. Real or not, her look then was more luminous than the sun which was beginning to rise.","Even though conditions such as lack of sleep, insufficient food and various mental stresses may suggest that the inmates were bound to react in certain ways, in the final analysis it becomes clear that the sort of person the prisoner became was the result of an inner decision, and not the result of camp influences alone.","It is true that we can see the therapist as a technician only if we have first viewed the patient as some sort of machine.","As the struggle for survival has subsided, the question has emerged: survival for what? Ever more people have the means to live, but no meaning to live for.","...to think of ourselves as those who were being questioned by life-daily and hourly. Our answer must consist, not in talk and meditation, but in right action and in right conduct.","These tasks, and therefore the meaning of life, differ from man to man, and from moment to moment. Thus it is impossible to define the meaning in life in a general way.","A human being is not one thing among others; things determine each other, but man is ultimately self-determining. What he becomes-within the limits of endowment and environment-he has made out of himself.","We dislike talking about our experiences. No explanations are needed for those who have been inside, and the others will understand neither how we felt then nor how we feel now.","As such, I also bear witness to the unexpected extent to which man is capable of defying and braving even the worst conditions conceivable.","The struggle for existence is a struggle \'for\' something; it is purposeful and only in so being is it meaningful and able to bring meaning into life.","The incurable sufferer is given very little opportunity to be proud of his suffering and to consider it ennobling rather than degrading\\" so that \\"he is not only unhappy, but also ashamed of being unhappy.","A sound philosophy of life, I think, may be the most valuable asset for a psychiatrist to have when he is treating a patient.","No one can take from us the ability to choose our attitudes toward the circumstances in which we find ourselves. This is the last of human freedoms.","Man\'s search for meaning is the primary motivation in his life and not a \\"secondary rationalization\\" of instinctual drives. This meaning is unique and specific in that it must and can be fulfilled by him alone; only then does it achieve a significance which will satisfy his own will to meaning.","Usually, to be sure, man considers only the stubble field of transitoriness and overlooks the full granaries of the past, wherein he had salvaged once and for all his deeds, his joys and also his sufferings. Nothing can be undone, and nothing can be done away with. I should say having been is the surest kind of being.","We needed to stop asking about the meaning of life.","There is also purpose in life which is almost barren of both creation and enjoyment and which admits of but one possibility of high moral behavior: namely, in man\'s attitude to his existence, an existence restricted by external forces.","The crowning experience of all, for the homecoming man, is the wonderful feeling that, after all he has suffered, there is nothing he need fear anymore\u2014except his God.","I became acquainted with those martyrs whose behavior in camp, whose suffering and death, bore witness to the fact that the last inner freedom cannot be lost.","Here lies the chance for a man either to make use of or to forgo the opportunities of attaining the moral values that a difficult situation may afford him. And this decides whether he is worthy of his sufferings or not.","Somewhere I heard a victorious \\"Yes\\" in answer to my question of the existence of ultimate purpose.","There are some authors who contend that meanings and values are \\"nothing but defense mechanisms, reaction formations and sublimations.\\" But as for myself, I would not be willing to live merely for the sake of my \\"defense mechanisms,\\" nor would I be ready to die merely for the sake of my \\"reaction formations.","How can we dare to predict the behavior of man? We may predict the movements of a machine, of an automaton; more than this, we many even try to predict the mechanisms or \\"dynamisms\\" of the human psyche as well. But man is more than psyche.","Having been is also a kind of being, and perhaps the surest kind.","Everything can be taken from a man but one thing: the last of the human freedoms\u2014to choose one\u2019s attitude in any given set of circumstances, to choose one\u2019s own way.","When we are no longer able to change a situation, we are challenged to change ourselves.","Don\'t aim at success. The more you aim at it and make it a target, the more you are going to miss it. For success, like happiness, cannot be pursued; it must ensue, and it only does so as the unintended side effect of one\'s personal dedication to a cause greater than oneself or as the by-product of one\'s surrender to a person other than oneself. Happiness must happen, and the same holds for success: you have to let it happen by not caring about it. I want you to listen to what your conscience commands you to do and go on to carry it out to the best of your knowledge. Then you will live to see that in the long-run\u2014in the long-run, I say!\u2014success will follow you precisely because you had forgotten to think about it","Those who have a \'why\' to live, can bear with almost any \'how\'.","Love is the only way to grasp another human being in the innermost core of his personality. No one can become fully aware of the very essence of another human being unless he loves him. By his love he is enabled to see the essential traits and features in the beloved person; and even more, he sees that which is potential in him, which is not yet actualized but yet ought to be actualized. Furthermore, by his love, the loving person enables the beloved person to actualize these potentialities. By making him aware of what he can be and of what he should become, he makes these potentialities come true.","Ultimately, man should not ask what the meaning of his life is, but rather must recognize that it is he who is asked. In a word, each man is questioned by life; and he can only answer to life by answering for his own life; to life he can only respond by being responsible.","So live as if you were living already for the second time and as if you had acted the first time as wrongly as you are about to act now!","The one thing you can\u2019t take away from me is the way I choose to respond to what you do to me. The last of one\u2019s freedoms is to choose one\u2019s attitude in any given circumstance.","The pessimist resembles a man who observes with fear and sadness that his wall calendar, from which he daily tears a sheet, grows thinner with each passing day. On the other hand, the person who attacks the problems of life actively is like a man who removes each successive leaf from his calendar and files it neatly and carefully away with its predecessors, after first having jotted down a few diary notes on the back. He can reflect with pride and joy on all the richness set down in these notes, on all the life he has already lived to the fullest. What will it matter to him if he notices that he is growing old? Has he any reason to envy the young people whom he sees, or wax nostalgic over his own lost youth? What reasons has he to envy a young person? For the possibilities that a young person has, the future which is in store for him?No, thank you,\' he will think. \'Instead of possibilities, I have realities in my past, not only the reality of work done and of love loved, but of sufferings bravely suffered. These sufferings are even the things of which I am most proud, although these are things which cannot inspire envy.","Love goes very far beyond the physical person of the beloved. It finds its deepest meaning in his spiritual being, his inner self. Whether or not he is actually present, whether or not he is still alive at all, ceases somehow to be of importance.","A man who becomes conscious of the responsibility he bears toward a human being who affectionately waits for him, or to an unfinished work, will never be able to throw away his life. He knows the \\"why\\" for his existence, and will be able to bear almost any \\"how\\".","By declaring that man is responsible and must actualize the potential meaning of his life, I wish to stress that the true meaning of life is to be discovered in the world rather than within man or his own psyche, as though it were a closed system. I have termed this constitutive characteristic \\"the self-transcendence of human existence.\\" It denotes the fact that being human always points, and is directed, to something or someone, other than oneself--be it a meaning to fulfill or another human being to encounter. The more one forgets himself--by giving himself to a cause to serve or another person to love--the more human he is and the more he actualizes himself. What is called self-actualization is not an attainable aim at all, for the simple reason that the more one would strive for it, the more he would miss it. In other words, self-actualization is possible only as a side-effect of self-transcendence.","But today\u2019s society is characterized by achievement orientation, and consequently it adores people who are successful and happy and, in particular, it adores the young. It virtually ignores the value of all those who are otherwise, and in so doing blurs the decisive difference between being valuable in the sense of dignity and being valuable in the sense of usefulness. If one is not cognizant of this difference and holds that an individual\u2019s value stems only from his present usefulness, then, believe me, one owes it only to personal inconsistency not to plead for euthanasia along the lines of Hitler\u2019s program, that is to say, \u2018mercy\u2019 killing of all those who have lost their social usefulness, be it because of old age, incurable illness, mental deterioration, or whatever handicap they may suffer. Confounding the dignity of man with mere usefulness arises from conceptual confusion that in turn may be traced back to the contemporary nihilism transmitted on many an academic campus and many an analytical couch.","I recommend that the Statue of Liberty on the East Coast be supplemented by a Statue of Responsiblity on the West Coast.","Dostoevski said once, \\"There is only one thing I dread: not to be worthy of my sufferings.\\" These words frequently came to my mind after I became acquainted with those martyrs whose behavior in camp, whose suffering and death, bore witness to the fact that the last inner freedom cannot be lost. It can be said that they were worthy of the their sufferings; the way they bore their suffering was a genuine inner achievement. It is this spiritual freedom\u2014which cannot be taken away\u2014that makes life meaningful and purposeful.","Everyone has his own specific vocation or mission in life; everyone must carry out a concrete assignment that demands fulfillment. Therein he cannot be replaced, nor can his life be repeated. Thus, everyone\'s task is unique as is his specific opportunity to implement it.","Man is originally characterized by his \\"search for meaning\\" rather than his \\"search for himself.\\" The more he forgets himself\u2014giving himself to a cause or another person\u2014the more human he is. And the more he is immersed and absorbed in something or someone other than himself the more he really becomes himself.","At the beginning of human history, man lost some of the basic animal instincts in which an animal\'s behavior is embedded and by which it is secured. Such security, like paradise, is closed to man forever; man has to make choices. In addition to this, however, man has suffered another loss in his more recent development inasmuch as the traditions which buttressed his behavior are now rapidly diminishing. No instinct tells him what he has to do, and no tradition tells him what he ought to do; sometimes he does not even know what he wishes to do. Instead, he either wishes to do what other people do (conformism) or he does what other people tell him to do (totalitarianism).","When a person can\'t find a deep sense of meaning, they distract themselves with pleasure.","For success, like happiness, cannot be pursued; it must ensue, and it only does so as the unintended side-effect of one\'s personal dedication to a cause greater than oneself or as the by-product of one\'s surrender to a person other than oneself. Happiness must happen, and the same holds for success: you have to let it happen by not caring about it.","Fear makes come true that which one is afraid of.","A thought transfixed me: for the first time in my life I saw the truth as it is set into song by so many poets, proclaimed as the final wisdom by so many thinkers. The truth-that love is the ultimate and the highest goal to which a man can aspire. Then I grasped the meaning of the greatest secret that human poetry and human thought and belief have to impart: The salvation of human is through love and in love. I understood how a man who has nothing left in this world still may know bliss, be it only for the brief moment, in the contemplation of his beloved. In a position of utter desolation, when a man cannot express himself in positive action, when his only achievement may consist in enduring his sufferings in the right way-an honorable way-in such a position man can, through loving contemplation of the image he carries of his beloved, achieve fulfillment. For the first time in my life I was able to understand the meaning of the words,\\"The angels are lost in perpetual contemplation of an infinite glory.","There are things which must cause you to lose your reason or you have none to lose","Thus it can be seen that mental health is based on a certain degree of tension, the tension between what one has already achieved and what one still ought to accomplish, or the gap between what one is and what one should become. Such a tension is inherent in the human being and therefore is indispensable to mental well-being. We should not, then, be hesitant about challenging man with a potential meaning for him to fulfill. It is only thus that we evoke his will to meaning from its state of latency. I consider it a dangerous misconception of mental hygiene to assume that what man needs in the first place is equilibrium or, as it is called in biology \\"homeostasis\\", i.e., a tensionless state. What man actually needs is not a tensionless state but rather the striving and struggling for a worthwhile goal, a freely chosen task. What he needs is not the discharge of tension at any cost but the call of a potential meaning waiting to be fulfilled by him.","The last of the human freedoms: to choose one\'s attitude in any given set of circumstances, to choose one\'s own way. And there were always choices to make. Every day, every hour, offered the opportunity to make a decision, a decision which determined whether you would or would not submit to those powers which threatened to rob you of your very self, your inner freedom; which determined whether or not you become the plaything to circumstance, renouncing freedom and dignity...","To Suffer unnecessarily is masochistic rather than heroic.","The meaning of life is to give life meaning.","Being human always points, and is directed, to something, or someone, other than oneself\u2014be it meaning to fulfill or another human being to encounter. The more one forgets himself\u2014by giving himself to a cause to serve or another person to love\u2014the more human he is and the more he actualizes himself. ... What is called self-actualization is not an attainable aim at all, for the simple reason that the more one would strive for it, the more he would miss it. In other words, self-actualization is possible only as a side-effect of self-transcendence.","Life is not primarily a quest for pleasure, as Freud believed, or a quest for power, as Alfred Adler taught, but a quest for meaning.","What was really needed was a fundamental change in our attitude toward life. We had to learn ourselves and, furthermore, we had to teach the despairing men, that it did not really matter what we expected from life, but rather what life expected from us. We needed to stop asking about the meaning of life, and instead to think of ourselves as those who were being questioned by life--daily and hourly. Our answer must consist, not in talk and meditation, but in right action and in right conduct. Life ultimately means taking the responsibility to find the right answer to its problems and to fulfill the tasks which it constantly sets for each individual.These tasks, and therefore the meaning of life, differ from man to man, and from moment to moment. Thus it is impossible to define the meaning of life in a general way. Questions about the meaning of life can never be answered by sweeping statements. \u201cLife does not mean something vague, but something very real and concrete, just as life\u2019s tasks are also very real and concrete. They form man\u2019s destiny, which is different and unique for each individual. No man and no destiny can be compared with any other man or any other destiny. No situation repeats itself, and each situation calls for a different response. Sometimes the situation in which a man finds himself may require him to shape his own fate by action. At other times it is more advantageous for him to make use of an opportunity for contemplation and to realize assets in this way. Sometimes man may be required simple to accept fate, to bear his cross. Every situation is distinguished by its uniqueness, and there is always only one right answer to the problem posed by the situation at hand.When a man finds that it is his destiny to suffer, he will have to accept his suffering as his task; his single and unique task. He will have to acknowledge the fact that even in suffering he is unique and alone in the universe. No one can relieve him of his suffering or suffer in his place. His unique opportunity lies in the way in which he bears his burden.\u201d","The truth-that love is the highest goal to which man can aspire.","Freedom, however, is not the last word. Freedom is only part of the story and half of the truth. Freedom is but the negative aspect of the whole phenomenon whose positive aspect is responsibleness. In fact, freedom is in danger of degenerating into mere arbitrariness unless it is lived in terms of responsibleness. That is why I recommend that the Statue of Liberty on the East Coast be supplemented by a Statue of Responsibility on the West Coast.","The salvation of man is through love and in love","Forces beyond your control can take away everything you possess except one thing, your freedom to choose how you will respond to the situation. You cannot control what happens to you in life, but you can always control what you will feel and do about what happens to you.","As each situation in life represents a challenge to man and presents a problem for him to solve, the question of the meaning of life may actually be reversed. Ultimately, man should not ask what the meaning of his life is, but rather he must recognize that it is he who is asked. In a word, each man is questioned by life; and he can only answer to life by answering for his own life; to life he can only respond by being responsible. Thus, logotherapy sees in responsibleness the very essence of human existence.","The way in which a man accepts his fate and all the suffering it entails, the way in which he takes up his cross, gives him ample opportunity \u2014 even under the most difficult circumstances \u2014 to add a deeper meaning to his life. It may remain brave, dignified and unselfish. Or in the bitter fight for self preservation he may forget his human dignity and become no more than an animal.","The story of the young woman whose death I witnessed in a concentration camp. It is a simple story. There is little to tell and it may sound as if I had invented it; but to me it seems like a poem. This young woman knew that she would die in the next few days. But when I talked to her she was cheerful in spite of this knowledge. \\"I am grateful that fate has hit me so hard,\\" she told me. \\"In my former life I was spoiled and did not take spiritual accomplishments seriously.\\" Pointing through the window of the hut, she said, \\"This tree here is the only friend I have in my loneliness.\\" Through that window she could see just one branch of a chestnut tree, and on the branch were two blossoms. \\"I often talk to this tree,\\" she said to me. I was startled and didn\'t quite know how to take her words. Was she delirious? Did she have occasional hallucinations? Anxiously I asked her if the tree replied. \\"Yes.\\" What did it say to her? She answered, \\"It said to me, \'I am here-I am here-I am life, eternal life.","Was Du erlebst, kann keine Macht der Welt Dir rauben. (What you have experienced, no power on earth can take from you.) Not only our experiences, but all we have done, whatever great thoughts we may have had and all we have suffered, all this is not lost, though it is past; we have brought it into being. Having been is a kind of being, and perhaps the surest kind.","Ultimate meaning necessarily exceeds and surpasses the finite intellectual capacities of man... What is demanded of man is not, as some existential philosophers teach, to endure the meaninglessness of life, but rather to bear his incapacity to grasp its unconditional meaningfulness in rational terms. Logos is deeper than logic.","So, let us be alert--alert in a twofold sense.Since Auschwitz we know what man is capable of. And since Hiroshima we know what is at stake.","One evening, when we were already resting on the floor of our hut, dead tired, soup bowls in hand, a fellow prisoner rushed in and asked us to run out to the assembly grounds and see the wonderful sunset. Standing outside we saw sinister clouds glowing in the west and the whole sky alive with clouds of ever-changing shapes and colors, from steel blue to blood red. The desolate grey mud huts provided a sharp contrast, while the puddles on the muddy ground reflected the glowing sky. Then, after minutes of moving silence, one prisoner said to another, \\"How beautiful the world could be...","We had to learn ourselves and, furthermore, we had to teach the despairing men, that it did not really matter what we expected from life, but rather what life expected from us. We need to stop asking about the meaning of life, and instead to think of ourselves as those who were being questioned by life\u2014hourly and daily.

He could not overcome the loss of his wife who had died two years before and whom he had loved above all else. Now, how can I help him? What should I tell him? Well, I refrained from telling him anything but instead confronted him with the question, \u201cWhat would have happened, Doctor, if you had died first, and your wife would have had to survive you? \u201cOh,\u201d he said, \u201cfor her this would have been terrible; how she would have suffered!\u201d Whereupon I replied, \u201cYou see, Doctor, such a suffering has been spared her, and it was you who have spared her this suffering \u2014 to be sure, at the price that now you have to survive and mourn her.\u201d He said no word but shook my hand and calmly left my office. In some way, suffering ceases to be suffering at the moment it finds a meaning, such as the meaning of a sacrifice.\u201d","The more one forgets himself\u2014by giving himself to a cause to serve or another person to love\u2014the more human he is and the more he actualizes himself.","Because of social pressure, individualism is rejected by most people in favor of conformity. Thus the individual relies mainly upon the actions of others and neglects the meaning of his own personal life. Hence he sees his own life as meaningless and falls into the \u201cexistential vacuum feeling inner void. Progressive automation causes increasing alcoholism, juvenile delinquency, and suicide.\u201d","Just consider a child who, absorbed in play, forgets himself\u2014this is the moment to take a snapshot; when you wait until he notices that you are taking a picture, his face congeals and freezes, showing his unnatural self-consciousness rather than his natural graciousness. Why do most people have that stereotyped expression on their faces whenever they are photographed? This expression stems from their concern with the impression they are going to leave on the onlooker. It is \\"cheese\\" that makes them so ugly. Forgetting themselves, the photographer, and the future onlooker would make them beautiful.","On the average, only those prisoners could keep alive who, after years of trekking from camp to camp, had lost all scruples in their fight for existence; they were prepared to use every means, honest and otherwise, even brutal force, theft, and betrayal of their friends, in order to save themselves. We who have come back, by the aid of many lucky chances or miracles - whatever one may choose to call them - we know: the best of us did not return.","The question was whether an ape which was being used to develop a poliomyelitis serum, and for this reason punctured again and again, would ever be able to grasp the meaning of its suffering. Unanimously, the group replied that of course it would not; with its limited intelligence, it could not enter into the world of man, i.e., the only world in which the meaning of its suffering would be understandable. Then I pushed forward with the following question: \u2018And what about man? Are you sure that the the human world is a terminal point in the evolution of the cosmos? Is it not conceivable that there is still another dimension, a world beyond man\u2019s world; a world in which the question of an ultimate meaning of human suffering would find an answer?","Live as if you were living already for the second time and as if you had acted the first time as wrongly as you are about to act now!\\" It seems to me that there is nothing which would stimulate a man\'s sense of responsibleness more than this maxim, which invites him to imagine first that the present is past and, second, that the past may yet be changed and amended.","Human potential at its best is to transform a tragedy into a personal triumph, to turn one\'s predicament into a human achievement.","Sigmund Freud once asserted, \\"Let one attempt to expose a number of the most diverse people uniformly to hunger. With the increase of the imperative urge of hunger all individual differences will blur, and in their stead will appear the uniform expression of the one unstilled urge.\\" Thank heaven, Sigmund Freud was spared knowing the concentration camps from the inside. His subjects lay on a couch designed in the plush style of Victorian culture, not in the filth of Auschwitz. There, the \\"individual differences\\" did not \\"blur\\" but, on the contrary, people became more different; people unmasked themselves, both the swine and the saints.","Life is not primarily a quest for pleasure, as Freud believed, or a quest for power, as Alfred Adler taught, but a quest for meaning. The greatest task for any person is to find meaning in his or her life. Frankl saw three possible sources for meaning: in work (doing something significant), in love (caring for another person), and in courage during difficult times. Suffering in and of itself is meaningless; we give our suffering meaning by the way in which we respond to it. At one point, Frankl writes that a person \u201cmay remain brave, dignified and unselfish, or in the bitter Fight for self-preservation he may forget his human dignity and become no more than an animal.","If we present a man with a concept of man which is not true, we may well corrupt him. When we present man as an automaton of reflexes, as a mind-machine, as a bundle of instincts, as a pawn of drives and reactions, as a mere product of instinct, heredity and environment, we feed the nihilism to which modern man is, in any case, prone.I became acquainted with the last stage of that corruption in my second concentration camp, Auschwitz. The gas chambers of Auschwitz were the ultimate consequence of the theory that man is nothing but the product of heredity and environment; or as the Nazi liked to say, \u2018of Blood and Soil.\u2019 I am absolutely convinced that the gas chambers of Auschwitz, Treblinka, and Maidanek were ultimately prepared not in some Ministry or other in Berlin, but rather at the desks and lecture halls of nihilistic scientists and philosophers.","It is the very pursuit of happiness that thwarts happiness.","The way in which a man accepts his fate and all the suffering it entails, the way in which he takes up his cross, gives him ample opportunity -even under the most difficult circumstances- to add a deeper meaning to his life.

Here lies the chance for a man either to make use of or forgo the opportunities of attaining the moral values that a difficult situation may afford him. And this decides whether he is worthy of his sufferings or not.","My mind still clung to the image of my wife. A thought crossed my mind: I didn\'t even know if she were still alive. I knew only one thing-which I have learned well by now: Love goes very far beyond the physical person of the beloved. It finds its deepest meaning in his spiritual being, his inner self. Whether or not he is actually present, whether or not he is still alive at all, ceases somehow to be of importance.","Fundamentally, therefore, any man can, even under such circumstances, decide what shall become of him-mentally and spiritually.

To put the question in general terms would be to the question posed to a chess champion: \\"Tell me, Master, what is the best move in the world?\\" There simply is no such thing as the best or even a good move apart from a particular situation in a game and the particular personality of one\'s opponent. The same holds for human existence. One should not search for an abstract meaning of life. Everyone has his own specific vocation or mission in life to carry out a concrete assignment which demands fulfillment. Therein he cannot be replaced, nor can his life be repeated. Thus, everyone\'s task is as unique as is his specific opportunity to implement it. As each situation in life represents a challenge to man and presents a problem for him to solve, the question of the meaning of life may actually be reversed. Ultimately, man should not ask what the meaning of life is, but rather he must recognize that it is he who is asked. In a word, each man is questioned by life; and he can only answer to life by answering for his own life; to life he can only respond by being responsible.","Thus suffering completely fills the human soul and conscious mind, no matter whether the suffering is great or little. Therefore the \'size\' of human suffering is absolutely relative\\".","We do not ask life what the meaning of life is. Life asks us, what is the meaning of your life. And life demands our answer.","I think it was Lessing who once said, \'There are things which must cause you to lose your reason or you have none to lose\'. An abnormal reaction to an abnormal situation is normal behaviour\\".","There were always choices to make. Every day, every hour, offered the opportunity to make a decision, a decision which determined whether you would or would not submit to those powers which threatened to rob you of your very self, your inner freedom; which determined whether or not you become the plaything to circumstance, renouncing freedom and dignity.","You may of course ask whether we really need to refer to \\"saints\\". Wouldn\'t it suffice just to refer to decent people? It is true that they form a minority. More than that, they always will remain a minority. And yet I see therein the very challenge to join the minority. For the world is in a bad state, but everything will become still worse unless each of us does his best.","A thought transfixed me: for the first time in my life I saw the truth as it is set into song by so many poets, proclaimed as the final wisdom by so many thinkers. The truth\u2014that love is the ultimate and the highest goal to which man can aspire. Then I grasped the meaning of the greatest secret that human poetry and human thought and belief have to impart: The salvation of man is through love and in love. I understood how a man who has nothing left in this world still may know bliss, be it only for a brief moment, in the contemplation of his beloved.","It is a peculiarity of man that he can only live by looking to the future - sub specie aeternitatis. And this is his salvation in the most difficult moments of his existence, although he sometimes has to force his mind to the task.","What man actually needs is not a tensionless state but rather the striving and struggling for a worthwhile goal, a freely chosen task. What he needs is not the discharge of tension at any cost but the call of a potential meaning waiting to be fulfilled by him.","\u062a\u062d\u0642\u064a\u0642 \u0627\u0644\u0630\u0627\u062a \u0644\u064a\u0633 \u0647\u0648 \u0627\u0644\u063a\u0627\u064a\u0629 \u0627\u0644\u0642\u0635\u0648\u0649 \u0639\u0646\u062f \u0627\u0644\u0627\u0646\u0633\u0627\u0646, \u0648\u0644\u0627 \u062d\u062a\u0649 \u0645\u0642\u0635\u062f\u0647 \u0627\u0644\u0623\u0648\u0644. \u0630\u0644\u0643 \u0623\u0646 \u062a\u062d\u0642\u064a\u0642 \u0627\u0644\u0630\u0627\u062a, \u0627\u0630\u0627 \u0635\u0627\u0631 \u063a\u0627\u064a\u0629 \u0641\u064a \u062d\u062f \u0630\u0627\u062a\u0647 \u0641\u0625\u0646\u0647 \u064a\u062a\u0639\u0627\u0631\u0636 \u0645\u0639 \u062e\u0627\u0635\u064a\u0629 \u062a\u062c\u0627\u0648\u0632 \u0627\u0644\u0630\u0627\u062a \u0623\u0648 \u0627\u0644\u062a\u0633\u0627\u0645\u064a \u0628\u0627\u0644\u0630\u0627\u062a \u0648\u0647\u064a \u0627\u0644\u062e\u0627\u0635\u064a\u0629 \u0627\u0644\u0645\u0645\u064a\u0632\u0629 \u0644\u0644\u0648\u062c\u0648\u062f \u0627\u0644\u0627\u0646\u0633\u0627\u0646\u064a. \u0648\u0628\u0627\u0644\u0627\u0636\u0627\u0641\u0629 \u0627\u0644\u0649 \u0630\u0644\u0643, \u0641\u0625\u0646 \u062a\u062d\u0642\u064a\u0642 \u0627\u0644\u0630\u0627\u062a \u0645\u0627 \u0647\u0648 \u0627\u0644\u0627 \u0646\u062a\u064a\u062c\u0629 \u0623\u0648 \u0623\u062b\u0631 -\u0623\u064a \u0623\u0646\u0647 \u0646\u062a\u064a\u062c\u0629 \u0623\u0648 \u0623\u062b\u0631 \u0644\u062a\u062d\u0642\u064a\u0642 \u0627\u0644\u0645\u0639\u0646\u0649, \u0648\u064a\u0646\u0628\u063a\u064a \u0623\u0646 \u064a\u0638\u0644 \u062a\u062d\u0642\u064a\u0642 \u0627\u0644\u0630\u0627\u062a \u0647\u0643\u0630\u0627. \u0630\u0644\u0643 \u0623\u0646 \u0627\u0644\u0627\u0646\u0633\u0627\u0646 \u0644\u0627 \u064a\u062d\u0642\u0642 \u0630\u0627\u062a\u0647 \u0627\u0644\u0627 \u0628\u0645\u0642\u062f\u0627\u0631 \u062a\u062d\u0642\u064a\u0642\u0647 \u0644\u0645\u0639\u0646\u0649 \u0641\u064a \u0647\u0630\u0627 \u0627\u0644\u0639\u0627\u0644\u0645. \u0648\u0639\u0644\u0649 \u0627\u0644\u0639\u0643\u0633 \u0645\u0646 \u0630\u0644\u0643, \u0625\u0630\u0627 \u0634\u0631\u0639 \u0627\u0644\u0641\u0631\u062f \u0641\u064a \u062a\u062d\u0642\u064a\u0642 \u0630\u0627\u062a\u0647 \u0628\u062f\u0644\u0627 \u0645\u0646 \u0623\u0646 \u064a\u062d\u0642\u0642 \u0645\u0639\u0646\u0649 \u0645\u0646 \u0627\u0644\u0645\u0639\u0627\u0646\u064a, \u0641\u0627\u0646 \u062a\u062d\u0642\u064a\u0642 \u0627\u0644\u0630\u0627\u062a \u0633\u0648\u0641 \u064a\u0641\u0642\u062f \u0645\u0628\u0631\u0631\u0627\u062a\u0647 \u0641\u064a \u0627\u0644\u062d\u0627\u0644.","\u0648\u0645\u0645\u0627 \u0644\u064a\u0628\u0639\u062b \u0639\u0646 \u0627\u0644\u0627\u0633\u062a\u063a\u0631\u0627\u0628 \u0627\u0646 \u0627\u0644\u0635\u0641\u0639\u0647 \u0627\u0644\u062a\u064a \u0644\u0627 \u062a\u062a\u0631\u0643 \u0639\u0644\u0649 \u0627\u0644\u0648\u062c\u0647 \u0639\u0644\u0627\u0645\u0627\u062a\u0647\u0627 \u062a\u0633\u062a\u0637\u064a\u0639 \u062a\u062d\u062a \u0638\u0631\u0648\u0641 \u0645\u0639\u064a\u0646\u0647 \u0627\u0646 \u062a\u0633\u0628\u0628 \u0627\u064a\u0644\u0627\u0645\u0627 \u0648\u0627\u064a\u0630\u0627\u0621 \u0627\u0643\u062b\u0631 \u0645\u0646 \u062a\u0644\u0643 \u0627\u0644\u0635\u0641\u0639\u0629 \u0627\u0644\u064a \u062a\u062a\u0631\u0643 \u0627\u062b\u0631\u0627 \u0639\u0644\u0649 \u0627\u0644\u0648\u062c\u0647","We must never forget that we may also find meaning in life even when confronted with a hopeless situation, when facing a fate that cannot be changed.

To be sure, people tend to see only the stubble fields of transitoriness but overlook and forget the full granaries of the past into which they have brought the harvest of their lives: the deeds done, the loves loved, and last but not least, the sufferings they have gone through with courage and dignity.From this one may see that there is no reason to pity the old people. Instead, young people should envy them. It is true that the old have no opportunities, no possibilities in the future. But they have more than that: Instead of possibilities in the future, they have realities in the past -the potentialities they have actualized, the meanings they have fulfilled, the values they have realized -and nothing and nobody can ever remove these assets from the past.","An active life serves the purpose of giving man the opportunity to realize values in creative work, while a passive life of enjoyment affords him the opportunity to obtain fulfillment in experiencing beauty, art, or nature. But there is also purpose in that life which is almost barren of both creation and enjoyment and which admits of but one possibility of high moral behavior: namely, in man\'s attitude to his existence, an existence restricted by external forces. A creative life and a life of enjoyment are banned to him. But not only creativeness and enjoyment are meaningful. If there is a meaning in life at all, then there must be a meaning in suffering. Suffering is an ineradicable part of life, even as fate and death. Without suffering and death human life cannot be complete.","No one has the right to do wrong, even if wrong has been done to them.","As to the causation, of the feeling of meaningless, one may say, albeit in an oversimplifying way, that people have enough to live by but nothing to live for; they have the means but no meaning.","A positive attitude enables a person to endure suffering and disappointment as well as enhance enjoyment and satisfaction. A negative attitude intensifies pain and deepens disappointments; it undermines and diminishes pleasure, happiness, and satisfaction; it may even lead to depression or physical illness.","Life is not primarily a quest for pleasure, as Freud believed, or a quest for power, as Alfred Adler taught, but a quest for meaning. The greatest task for any person is to find meaning in his or her life.

Whether or not he is actually present, whether or not he is still alive at all, ceases somehow to be of importance.I did not know whether my wife was alive, and I had no menas of finding out (during all my prison life there was no outgoing or incoming mail); but at that moment it ceased to matter. There was no need for me to know; nothing could touch the strength of my love, my thought, and the image of my beloved. Had I known then that my wife was dead, I think that I would still have given myself, undisturbed by that knowledge, to the contemplation of her image, and that my mental conversations with her would have been just as vivid and just as stisfying. \'Set me like a seal upon thy heart, love is as strong as death.","It is we ourselves who must answer the questions that life asks of us, and to those questions we can respond only by being responsible for our existence.","Love is the only way to grasp another human being in the innermost core of his personality. No one can become fully aware of the very essence of another human being unless he loves him. By his love he is enabled to see the essential traits and features in the beloved person; and even more, he sees that which is potential in him, which is not yet actualized but yet ought to be actualized. Furthermore, by his love, the loving person enables the beloved person to actualize these potentialities. By making him aware of what he can be and of what he should become, he makes these potentialities come true. In logotherapy, love is not interpreted as a mere epiphenomenon of sexual drives and instincts in the sense of a so-called sublimation. Love is as primary a phenomenon as sex. Normally, sex is a vehicle of expression for love. Sex is justified, even sanctified, as soon as, but only as long as, it is a vehicle of love. Thus love is not understood as a mere side-effect of sex; rather, sex is a way of expressing the experience of that ultimate togetherness which is called love.","When we spoke about attempts to give a man in camp mental courage, we said that he had to be shown something to look forward to in the future. He had to be reminded that life still waited for him, that a human being waited for his return. But after liberation? There were some men who found that no one awaited them. Woe to him who found that the person whose memory alone had given him courage in camp did not exist any more! Woe to him who, when the day of his dreams finally came, found it so different from all he had longed for! Perhaps he boarded a trolley, traveled out to the home which he had seen for years in his mind, and only in his mind, and pressed the bell, just as he has longed to do in thousands of dreams, only to find that the person who should open the door was not there, and would never be there again.","\u0644\u0642\u062f \u062f\u0639\u0648\u062a \u0627\u0644\u0644\u0647 \u0645\u0646 \u0633\u062c\u0646\u064a \u0627\u0644\u0636\u064a\u0642, \u0641\u0623\u062c\u0627\u0628\u0646\u064a \u0641\u064a \u0631\u062d\u0627\u0628\u0629 \u0627\u0644\u0643\u0648\u0646","Life is like being at the dentist.

To be sure, people tend to see only the stubble fields of transitoriness but overlook and forget the full granaries of the past into which they have brought the harvest of their lives: the deeds done, the loves loved, and last but not least, the sufferings they have gone through with courage and dignity.","Everywhere man is confronted with fate, with the chance of achieving something through his own suffering.","From all this we may learn that there are two races of men in this world, but only these two\u2014the \u201crace of the decent man and the \u201crace\u201d of the indecent man. Both are found everywhere; they penetrate into all groups of society. No group consists entirely of decent or indecent people. In this sense, no group is of \u201cpure race\u201d\u2014and therefore one occasionally found a decent fellow among the camp guards.\u201d","the meaning of life always changes, but that it never ceases to be. According to logotherapy, we can discover this meaning in life in three different ways: (1) by creating a work or doing a deed; (2) by experiencing something or encountering someone; and (3) by the attitude we take toward unavoidable suffering.","We stumbled on in the darkness, over big stones and through large puddles, along the one road leading from the camp. The accompanying guards kept shouting at us and driving us with the butts of their rifles. Anyone with very sore feet supported himself on his neighbor\'s arm. Hardly a word was spoken; the icy wind did not encourage talk. Hiding his mouth behind his upturned collar, the man marching next to me whispered suddenly: \\"If our wives could see us now! I do hope they are better off in their camps and don\'t know what is happening to us.\\"That brought thoughts of my own wife to mind. And as we stumbled on for miles, slipping on icy spots, supporting each other time and again, dragging one another up and onward, nothing was said, but we both knew: each of us was thinking of his wife. Occasionally I looked at the sky, where the stars were fading and the pink light of the morning was beginning to spread behind a dark bank of clouds. But my mind clung to my wife\'s image, imagining it with an uncanny acuteness. I heard her answering me, saw her smile, her frank and encouraging look. Real or not, her look was then more luminous than the sun which was beginning to rise.A thought transfixed me: for the first time in my life I saw the truth as it is set into song by so many poets, proclaimed as the final wisdom by so many thinkers. The truth \u2013 that love is the ultimate and the highest goal to which man can aspire. Then I grasped the meaning of the greatest secret that human poetry and human thought and belief have to impart: The salvation of man is through love and in love. I understood how a man who has nothing left in this world still may know bliss, be it only for a brief moment, in the contemplation of his beloved. In a position of utter desolation, when man cannot express himself in positive action, when his only achievement may consist in enduring his sufferings in the right way\u2014an honorable way\u2014in such a position man can, through loving contemplation of the image he carries of his beloved, achieve fulfillment. For the first time in my life I was able to understand the meaning of the words, \\"The angels are lost in perpetual contemplation of an infinite glory.","An active life serves the purpose of giving man the opportunity to realize values in creative work, while a passive life of enjoyment affords him the opportunity to obtain fulfillment in experiencing beauty, art, or nature.","There are two races of men in this world, but only these two\u2014the \u201crace of the decent man and the \u201crace\u201d of the indecent man.\u201d","Emotion, which is suffering, ceases to be suffering as soon as we form a clear and precise picture of it.","I doubt whether a doctor can answer this question in general terms. For the meaning of life differs from man to man, from day to day and from hour to hour. What matters, therefore, is not the meaning of life in general but rather the specific meaning of a person\u2019s life at a given moment. To put the question in general terms would be comparable to the question posed to a chess champion: \u201cTell me, Master, what is the best move in the world? There simply is no such thing as the best or even a good move apart from a particular situation in a game and the particular personality of one\u2019s opponent. The same holds for human existence. One should not search for an abstract meaning of life. Everyone has his own specific vocation or mission in life to carry out a concrete assignment which demands fulfillment. Therein he cannot be replaced, nor can his life be repeated. Thus, everyone\u2019s task is as unique as is his specific opportunity to implement it.\u201d","Love is the only way to grasp another human being in the innermost core of his personality. No one can become fully aware of the very essence of another human being unless he loves him.","For too long a time--for half a century, in fact--psychiatry tried to interpret the human mind merely as a mechanism, and consequently the therapy of mental disease merely in terms of technique. I believe this dream has been dreamt out. What now begins to loom on the horizon is not psychologized medicine but rather those of human psychiatry.","It did not really matter what we expected from life, but rather what life expected from us.","The second way of finding a meaning in life is by experiencing something\u2014such as goodness, truth and beauty\u2014by experiencing nature and culture or, last but not least, by experiencing another human being in his very uniqueness\u2014by loving him.","The third aspect of the tragic triad concerns death. But it concerns life as well, for at any time each of the moments of which life consists is dying, and that moment will never recur. And yet is not this transitoriness a reminder that challenges us to make the best possible use of each moment of our lives?","George, you must realize that the world is a joke. There is no justice, everything is random. Only when you realize this will you understand how silly it is to take yourself seriously. There is no grand purpose in the universe. It just is. There\u2019s no particular meaning in what decision you make today about how to act.","The meaning of your life is to help others find the meaning of theirs.","I refer to what is called mysterium iniquitatis, meaning, as I see it, that a crime in the final analysis remains inexplicable inasmuch as it cannot be fully traced back to biological, psychological and/or sociological factors. Totally explaining one\u2019s crime would be tantamount to explaining away his or her guilt and to seeing in him or her not a free and responsible human being but a machine to be repaired. Even criminals themselves abhor this treatment and prefer to be held responsible for their deeds. From a convict serving his sentence in an Illinois penitentiary I received a letter in which he deplored that \'the criminal never has a chance to explain himself. He is offered a variety of excuses to choose from. Society is blamed and in many instances the blame is put on the victim.","If there is a meaning in life at all, then there must be a meaning in suffering. Suffering is an ineradicable part of life, even as fate and death. Without suffering and death human life cannot be complete.","As long as a self is driven by an id to a Thou, it is not a matter of love, either. In love the self is not driven by the id, but rather the self chooses the Thou.","Don\'t aim at success - the more you aim at it and make it a target, the more you are going to miss it. For success, like happiness, cannot be pursued; it must ensue, and it only does so as the unintended side-effect of one\'s dedication to a cause greater than oneself or as the by-product of one\'s surrender to a person other than oneself. Happiness must happen, and the same holds for success: you have to let it happen by not caring about it.","The immediate influence of behavior is always more effective than that of words.","There are situations in which one is cut off from the opportunity to do one\'s work or enjoy one\'s life; but what can never be ruled out is the unavoidability of suffering. In accepting this challenge to suffer bravely, life has a meaning up to the last moment, and it retains this meaning literally to the end. In other words, life\'s meaning is an unconditional one, for it even includes the potential meaning of unavoidable suffering.","\u0623\u0646 \u0627\u0644\u062d\u0628 \u064a\u0630\u0647\u0628 \u0627\u0644\u0649 \u0645\u0627 \u0647\u0648\u0623\u0628\u0639\u062f \u0641\u064a \u063a\u0627\u064a\u062a\u0647 \u0645\u0646 \u0627\u0644\u0634\u062e\u0635 \u0627\u0644\u0628\u062f\u0646\u064a \u0644\u0644\u0645\u062d\u0628\u0648\u0628. \u0647\u0630\u0627 \u0627\u0644\u062d\u0628 \u064a\u062c\u062f \u0645\u0639\u0646\u0627\u0647 \u0627\u0644\u0623\u0639\u0645\u0642 \u0641\u064a \u0627\u0644\u0648\u062c\u0648\u062f \u0627\u0644\u0631\u0648\u062d\u064a \u0644\u0647\u0630\u0627 \u0627\u0644\u0634\u062e\u0635 \u0627\u0644\u0645\u062d\u0628\u0648\u0628\u060c \u0623\u064a \u0641\u064a \u0630\u0627\u062a\u0647 \u0627\u0644\u062f\u0627\u062e\u0644\u064a\u0629","\u0627\u0644\u0627\u0646\u0633\u0627\u0646 \u0644\u064a\u0633 \u0645\u0634\u0631\u0648\u0637\u0627 \u0627\u0648 \u0645\u062d\u062a\u0648\u0645 \u0627\u0644\u0633\u0644\u0648\u0643 \u0628\u0635\u0648\u0631\u0629 \u0643\u0644\u064a\u0629 \u0648\u0644\u0643\u0646\u0647 \u064a\u0642\u0631\u0631 \u0646\u0641\u0633\u0647 \u0633\u0648\u0627\u0621 \u0633\u0644\u0645 \u062a\u0633\u0644\u064a\u0645\u0627 \u0643\u0627\u0645\u0644\u0627 \u0644\u0644\u0638\u0631\u0648\u0641 \u0623\u0648 \u0627\u062a\u062e\u0630 \u0628\u0634\u0623\u0646 \u0647\u0630\u0647 \u0627\u0644\u0638\u0631\u0648\u0641 \u0645\u0648\u0642\u0641\u0627. \u0648\u0627\u0644\u0627\u0646\u0633\u0627\u0646 \u0628\u0642\u0648\u0644 \u0622\u062e\u0631, \u0627\u0646\u0645\u0627 \u064a\u0642\u0631\u0631 \u0644\u0646\u0641\u0633\u0647, \u064a\u0646\u062a\u0642\u064a \u0627\u0644\u063a\u0627\u064a\u0629 \u0648\u0627\u0644\u0646\u0647\u0627\u064a\u0629 \\"\u0627\u0644\u0645\u0642\u0631\u0631 \u0644\u0646\u0641\u0633\u0647\\". \u0648\u0647\u0630\u0627 \u0647\u0648 \u062c\u0648\u0647\u0631\u0647. \u0641\u0627\u0644\u0627\u0646\u0633\u0627\u0646 \u0644\u064a\u0633 \u0628\u0628\u0633\u0627\u0637\u0629 \u0623\u0645\u0631\u0627 \u0645\u0648\u062c\u0648\u062f\u0627, \u0648\u0644\u0643\u0646\u0647 \u064a\u0642\u0631\u0631 \u062f\u0627\u0626\u0645\u0627 \u0648\u062c\u0648\u062f\u0647 \u0627\u0644\u0630\u064a \u0633\u064a\u0643\u0648\u0646 \u0639\u0644\u064a\u0647, \u0648\u064a\u0642\u0631\u0631 \u0645\u0627 \u0627\u0644\u0630\u064a \u0633\u0648\u0641 \u064a\u0635\u064a\u0631 \u0627\u0644\u064a\u0647 \u0641\u064a \u0627\u0644\u0644\u062d\u0638\u0629 \u0627\u0644\u062a\u0627\u0644\u064a\u0629.","For the meaning of life differs from man to man, from day to day and from hour to hour.

When the impossibility of replacing a person is realized, it allows the responsibility which a man has for his existence and its continuance to appear in all its magnitude. A man who becomes conscious of the responsibility he bears toward a human being who affectionately waits for him, or to an unfinished work, will never be able to throw away his life.

Such detachment is granted to the outsider, but he is too far removed to make any statements of real value. Only the man inside knows.

What is dangerous is the attempt of a man who is an expert, say, in the field of biology, to understand and explain human beings exclusively in terms of biology. The same is true of psychology and sociology as well. At the moment at which totality is claimed, biology becomes biologism, psychology becomes psychologism, and sociology becomes sociologism. In other words, at that moment science is turned into ideology. What we have to deplore, I would say, is not that scientists are specializing, but that the specialists are generalizing.

This is understandable; it may be due to a twofold loss which man has had to undergo since he became a truly human being. At the beginning of human history, man lost some of the basic animal instincts in which an animal\'s behavior is embedded and by which it is secured. Such security, like paradise, is closed to man forever; man has to make choices. In addition to this, however, man has suffered another loss in his more recent development inasmuch as the traditions which buttressed his behavior are now rapidly diminishing. No instinct tells him what he has to do, and no tradition tells him what he ought to do; sometimes he does not even know what he wishes to do.

be valuable when it is not individuality for its own sake but individuality for the human community.","Life in a concentration camp tore open the human soul and exposed its depths.","There is nothing

The fear of sleeplessness12 results in a hyper-intention to fall asleep, which, in turn, incapacitates the patient to do so. To overcome this particular fear, I usually advise the patient not to try to sleep but rather to try to do just the opposite, that is, to stay awake as long as possible. In other words, the hyper-intention to fall asleep, arising from the anticipatory anxiety of not being able to do so, must be replaced by the paradoxical intention not to fall asleep, which soon will be followed by sleep.","They died less from lack of food or medicine than from lack of hope, lack of something to live for.","\u0627\u0644\u0643\u0627\u0626\u0646 \u0627\u0644\u0627\u0646\u0633\u0627\u0646\u064a \u0644\u064a\u0633 \u0634\u064a\u0626\u0627 \u0648\u0627\u062d\u062f\u0627 \u0628\u064a\u0646 \u0623\u0634\u064a\u0627\u0621 \u0623\u062e\u0631\u0649, \u0645\u0645\u0627 \u064a\u062d\u062f\u062f \u0628\u0639\u0636\u0647\u0627 \u0627\u0644\u0628\u0639\u0636 \u0627\u0644\u0622\u062e\u0631, \u0648\u0644\u0643\u0646 \u0627\u0644\u0627\u0646\u0633\u0627\u0646 \u0647\u0648 \u0627\u0644\u0630\u064a \u064a\u062d\u062f\u062f \u0641\u064a \u0627\u0644\u0646\u0647\u0627\u064a\u0629 \u0630\u0627\u062a\u0647. \u0641\u0645\u0627 \u064a\u0635\u064a\u0631 \u0639\u0644\u064a\u0647 -\u062f\u0627\u062e\u0644 \u062d\u062f\u0648\u062f \u0627\u0644\u0648\u0631\u0627\u062b\u0629 \u0648\u0627\u0644\u0628\u064a\u0626\u0629- \u0625\u0646\u0645\u0627 \u064a\u0643\u0648\u0646 \u0642\u062f \u062d\u0642\u0642\u0647 \u0625\u0646\u0637\u0644\u0627\u0642\u0627 \u0645\u0646 \u0630\u0627\u062a\u0647. \u0639\u0644\u0649 \u0633\u0628\u064a\u0644 \u0627\u0644\u0645\u062b\u0627\u0644, \u0641\u064a \u0645\u0639\u0633\u0643\u0631\u0627\u062a \u0627\u0644\u0627\u0639\u062a\u0642\u0627\u0644 - \u0623\u064a \u0641\u064a \u0647\u0630\u0627 \u0627\u0644\u0645\u0639\u0645\u0644 \u0627\u0644\u062d\u064a \u0648\u0641\u064a \u0647\u0630\u0627 \u0627\u0644\u0645\u062c\u0627\u0644 \u0627\u0644\u0627\u062e\u062a\u0628\u0627\u0631\u064a- \u0644\u0627\u062d\u0638\u0646\u0627 \u0648\u0634\u0647\u062f\u0646\u0627 \u0628\u0639\u0636\u0627 \u0645\u0646 \u0632\u0645\u0644\u0627\u0626\u0646\u0627 \u064a\u0633\u0644\u0643\u0648\u0646 \u0643\u0627\u0644\u062e\u0646\u0627\u0632\u064a\u0631, \u0641\u064a \u062d\u064a\u0646 \u064a\u0633\u0644\u0643 \u0627\u0644\u0628\u0639\u0636 \u0627\u0644\u0622\u062e\u0631 \u0643\u0627\u0644\u0645\u0644\u0627\u0626\u0643\u0629. \u0648\u064a\u0648\u062c\u062f \u0647\u0630\u0627\u0646 \u0627\u0644\u0646\u0645\u0637\u0627\u0646 \u0645\u0646 \u0627\u0644\u0627\u0645\u0643\u0627\u0646\u0627\u062a \u0643\u0644\u0627\u0647\u0645\u0627 \u0628\u062f\u0627\u062e\u0644 \u0627\u0644\u0627\u0646\u0633\u0627\u0646, \u0648\u0644\u0643\u0646 \u0627\u0644\u0646\u0645\u0637 \u0627\u0644\u0630\u064a \u064a\u062a\u062d\u0642\u0642 \u0645\u0646\u0647\u0627 \u0625\u0646\u0645\u0627 \u064a\u062a\u0648\u0642\u0641 \u0639\u0644\u0649 \u0645\u0627 \u064a\u062a\u062e\u0630 \u0645\u0646 \u0642\u0631\u0627\u0631\u0627\u062a \u0648\u0644\u0643\u0646\u0647 \u0644\u0627 \u064a\u062a\u0648\u0642\u0641 \u0639\u0644\u0649 \u0627\u0644\u0638\u0631\u0648\u0641.\u0627\u0646 \u062c\u064a\u0644\u0646\u0627 \u0644\u062c\u064a\u0644 \u0648\u0627\u0642\u0639\u064a \u0644\u0623\u0646\u0646\u0627 \u0642\u062f \u062a\u0648\u0635\u0644\u0646\u0627 \u0627\u0644\u0649 \u0623\u0646 \u0646\u0639\u0631\u0641 \u0627\u0644\u0627\u0646\u0633\u0627\u0646 \u0643\u0645\u0627 \u0647\u0648 \u0641\u064a \u0627\u0644\u0648\u0627\u0642\u0639. \u0648\u0645\u0639 \u0643\u0644 \u0630\u0644\u0643, \u0641\u0627\u0644\u0627\u0646\u0633\u0627\u0646 \u0647\u0648 \u0630\u0644\u0643 \u0627\u0644\u0643\u0627\u0626\u0646 \u0627\u0644\u0630\u064a \u0627\u0628\u062a\u062f\u0639 \u063a\u0631\u0641 \u0627\u0644\u0627\u0639\u062f\u0627\u0645 \u0628\u0627\u0644\u063a\u0627\u0632 \u0641\u064a \u0622\u0648\u0634\u0648\u064a\u062a\u0632, \u0648\u0628\u0627\u0644\u0631\u063a\u0645 \u0645\u0646 \u0630\u0644\u0643 \u0641\u0623\u0646\u0647 \u0647\u0648 \u0623\u064a\u0636\u0627 \u0630\u0644\u0643 \u0627\u0644\u0643\u0627\u0626\u0646 \u0627\u0644\u0630\u064a \u062f\u062e\u0644\u0647\u0627 \u0634\u0627\u0645\u062e \u0627\u0644\u0623\u0646\u0641, \u0645\u0631\u0641\u0648\u0639 \u0627\u0644\u0642\u0627\u0645\u0629, \u0634\u0627\u0643\u0631\u0627 \u0631\u0628\u0647.","Man does not simply exist, but always decides what his existence will be, what he will become in the next moment..","A human being is not one thing among others; things determine each other, but man is ultimately self-determining.

But how many free men, let alone prisoners, possess it?","Is it not conceivable that there is still another dimension, a world beyond man\'s world; a world in which the question of an ultimate meaning of human suffering would find an answer?","The way in which a man accepts his fate and all the suffering it entails, the way in which he takes up his cross, gives him ample opportunity\u2014even under the most diffcult circumstances\u2014to add a deeper meaning to his life. It may remain brave, dignified and unselfish. Or in the bitter fight for self-preservation he may forget his human dignity and become no more than an animal. Here lies the chance for a man either to make use of or to forgo the opportunities of attaining the moral values that a diffcult situation may afford him. And this decides whether he is worthy of his sufferings or not. A human being is not one thing among others; things determine each other, but man is ultimately self-determining. What he becomes\u2014within the limits of endowment and environment\u2014he has made out of himself. In the concentration camps, for example, in this living laboratory and on this testing ground, we watched and witnessed some of our comrades behave like swine while others behaved like saints. Man has both potentialities within himself; which one is actualized depends on decisions but not on conditions.","Normally pleasure is never the goal of human strivings but rather is, and must remain, an effect, more specifically, the side effect of attaining a goal. Attaining the goal constitutes a reason for being happy. In other words, if there is a reason for happiness, happiness ensues, automatically and spontaneously, as it were. And that is why one need not pursue happiness, one need not care for it once there is a reason for it. Figure 3 But, even more, one cannot pursue it. To the extent to which one makes happiness the objective of his motivation, he necessarily makes it the object of his attention. But precisely by so doing he loses sight of the reason for happiness, and happiness itself must fade away.","You cannot control what happens to you in life, but you can always control what you will feel and do about what happens to you.","\u062d\u064a\u0646\u0645\u0627 \u064a\u062c\u062f \u0627\u0644\u0625\u0646\u0633\u0627\u0646 \u0623\u0646 \u0645\u0635\u064a\u0631\u0647 \u0647\u0648 \u0627\u0644\u0645\u0639\u0627\u0646\u0627\u0629\u060c \u0641\u0625\u0646 \u0639\u0644\u064a\u0647 \u0623\u0646 \u064a\u062a\u0642\u0628\u0644 \u0622\u0644\u0627\u0645\u0647 \u0648 \u0645\u0639\u0627\u0646\u0627\u062a\u0647 \u0643\u0645\u0627 \u0644\u0648 \u0623\u0646\u0647\u0627 \u0645\u0647\u0645\u0629 \u0645\u0641\u0631\u0648\u0636\u0629 \u0639\u0644\u064a\u0647\u060c \u0648\u0647\u064a \u0645\u0647\u0645\u0629 \u0641\u0631\u064a\u062f\u0629 \u0648\u0645\u062a\u0645\u064a\u0632\u0629. \u0648 \u0639\u0644\u064a\u0647 \u0623\u0646 \u064a\u0639\u062a\u0631\u0641 \u0628\u0627\u0644\u062d\u0642\u064a\u0642\u0629 \u0628\u0623\u0646\u0647 \u062d\u062a\u0649 \u0641\u064a \u0627\u0644\u0645\u0639\u0627\u0646\u0627\u0629 \u0641\u0647\u0648 \u0641\u0631\u064a\u062f \u0648 \u0648\u062d\u064a\u062f \u0641\u064a \u0627\u0644\u0643\u0648\u0646. \u0644\u0627 \u064a\u0633\u062a\u0637\u064a\u0639 \u0623\u062d\u062f \u0623\u0646 \u064a\u062e\u0644\u0635\u0647 \u0645\u0646 \u0645\u0639\u0627\u0646\u0627\u062a\u0647 \u0623\u0648 \u064a\u0639\u0627\u0646\u064a \u0628\u062f\u0644\u0627\u064b \u0645\u0646\u0647. \u0641\u0641\u0631\u0635\u062a\u0647 \u0627\u0644\u0641\u0631\u064a\u062f\u0629 \u062a\u0643\u0645\u0646 \u0641\u064a \u0627\u0644\u0637\u0631\u064a\u0642\u0629 \u0627\u0644\u062a\u064a \u064a\u062a\u062d\u0645\u0644 \u0628\u0647\u0627 \u0623\u0639\u0628\u0627\u0621\u0647 \u0648 \u0645\u062a\u0627\u0639\u0628\u0647","The attempt to develop a sense of humor and to see things in a humorous light is some kind of a trick learned while mastering the art of living.

If a certain quantity of gas is pumped into an empty chamber, it will fill the chamber completely and evenly, no matter how big the chamber. Thus suffering completely fills the human soul and conscious mind, no matter whether the suffering is great or little.

But there is also purpose in that life which is almost barren of both creation and enjoyment which admits of but one possibility of high moral behavior: namely, in man\'s attitude to his existence, an existence restricted by external forces. A creative life and a life of enjoyment are banned to him. But not only creativeness and enjoyment are meaningful. If there is a meaning in life at all, then there must be a meaning in suffering. Suffering is an ineradicable part of life, even as fate and death. Without suffering and death human life cannot be complete.The way in which a man accepts his fate and all the suffering it entails, the way in which he takes up his cross, gives him ample opportunity-even under the most difficult circumstances- to add a deeper meaning to his life. It may remain brave, dignified, and unselfish. Or in the bitter fight for self-preservation he may forget his human dignity and become no more than an animal. Here lies the chance for a man either to make use of or to forgo the opportunities of attaining the moral values that a difficult situation may afford him. And this decides whether he is worthy of his sufferings or not. Do not think that these considerations are unworldly and too far removed from real life. It is true that only a few people are capable of reaching such high moral standards. Of the prisoners only a few kept their full inner liberty and obtained those values which their suffering afforded, but even one such example is sufficient proof that man\'s inner strength may raise him above his outward fate. Such men are not only in concentration camps. Everywhere man is confronted with fate, with the chance of achieving something through his own suffering.","\xbfQui\xe9n es, en realidad, el hombre? Es el ser que siempre decide lo que es.","fear brings about that which one is afraid of, and hyper-intention makes impossible what one wishes","Nadie deber\xeda juzgar, nadie, a no ser que con absoluta sinceridad pudiera asegurar que, en una situaci\xf3n similar, actuar\xeda de manera diferente.","Live as if you were living already for the second time and as if you had acted the first time as wrongly as you are about to act now.","In the concentration camps...we watched and witnessed some of our comrades behave like swine while others behaved like saints. Man has both potentialities within himself; which one is actualized depends on decisions but not on conditions.","Thus far we have shown that the meaning of life always changes, but that it never ceases to be. According to logotherapy, we can discover this meaning in life in three different ways: (1) by creating a work or doing a deed; (2) by experiencing something or encountering someone; and (3) by the attitude we take toward unavoidable suffering.","To invoke an analogy, consider a movie: it consists of thousands upon thousands of individual pictures, and each of them makes sense and carries a meaning, yet the meaning of the whole film cannot be seen before its last sequence is shown. However, we cannot understand the whole film without having first understood each of its components, each of the individual pictures. Isn\u2019t it the same with life? Doesn\u2019t the final meaning of life, too, reveal itself, if at all, only at its end, on the verge of death? And doesn\u2019t this final meaning, too, depend on whether or not the potential meaning of each single situation has been actualized to the best of the respective individual\u2019s knowledge and belief?","One could make a victory of those experiences, turning life into an inner triumph, or one could ignore the challenge and simply vegetate, as did a majority of the prisoners.","The truth\u2014that love is the ultimate and the highest goal to which man can aspire. Then I grasped the meaning of the greatest secret that human poetry and human thought and belief have to impart: The salvation of man is through love and in love.","Logotherapy bases its technique called \u201cparadoxical intention on the twofold fact that fear brings about that which one is afraid of, and that hyper-intention makes impossible what one wishes. In German I described paradoxical intention as early as 1939.11 In this approach the phobic patient is invited to intend, even if only for a moment, precisely that which he fears. Let me recall a case. A young physician consulted me because of his fear of perspiring. Whenever he expected an outbreak of perspiration, this anticipatory anxiety was enough to precipitate excessive sweating. In order to cut this circle formation I advised the patient, in the event that sweating should recur, to resolve deliberately to show people how much he could sweat. A week later he returned to report that whenever he met anyone who triggered his anticipatory anxiety, he said to himself, \u201cI only sweated out a quart before, but now I\u2019m going to pour at least ten quarts!\u201d The result was that, after suffering from his phobia for four years, he was able, after a single session, to free himself permanently of it within one week. The reader will note that this procedure consists of a reversal of the patient\u2019s attitude, inasmuch as his fear is replaced by a paradoxical wish. By this treatment, the wind is taken out of the sails of the anxiety. Such a procedure, however, must make use of the specifically human capacity for self-detachment inherent in a sense of humor. This basic capacity to detach one from oneself is actualized whenever the logotherapeutic technique called paradoxical intention is applied. At the same time, the patient is enabled to put himself at a distance from his own neurosis. A statement consistent with this is found in Gordon W. Allport\u2019s book, The Individual and His Religion: \u201cThe neurotic who learns to laugh at himself may be on the way to self-management, perhaps to cure.\u201d12 Paradoxical intention is the empirical validation and clinical application of Allport\u2019s statement.\u201d","Once the meaning of suffering had been revealed to us, we refused to minimize or alleviate the camp\u2019s tortures by ignoring them or harboring false illusions and entertaining artificial optimism. Suffering had become a task on which we did not want to turn our backs. We had realized its hidden opportunities for achievement, the opportunities which caused the poet Rilke to write, \u201cWie viel ist aufzuleiden! (How much suffering there is to get through!).\u201d","Life is not primarily a quest for pleasure, as Freud believed, or a quest for power, as Alfred Adler taught, but a quest for meaning. The greatest task for any person is to find meaning in his or her life. Frankl saw three possible sources for meaning: in work (doing something significant), in love (caring for another person), and in courage during difficult times.","there are various masks and guises under which the existential vacuum appears. Sometimes the frustrated will to meaning is vicariously compensated for by a will to power, including the most primitive form of the will to power, the will to money. In other cases, the place of frustrated will to meaning is taken by the will to pleasure. That is why existential frustration often eventuates in sexual compensation. We can observe in such cases that the sexual libido becomes rampant in the existential vacuum.","people have enough to live by but nothing to live for;","No instinct tells him what he has to do, and no tradition tells him what he ought to do; sometimes he does not even know what he wishes to do. Instead, he either wishes to do what other people do (conformism) or he does what other people wish him to do (totalitarianism).","The truth-that love is the ultimate and highest goal to which man can aspire. I understood how a man who has nothing left in this world still may know bliss, be it only for a brief moment, in the contemplation of his beloved.","What was really needed was a fundamental change in our attitude toward life. We had to learn ourselves and, furthermore, we had to teach the despairing men, that it did not really matter what we expected from life, but rather what life expected from us. We needed to stop asking about the meaning of life, and instead to think of ourselves as those who were being questioned by life\u2014daily and hourly. Our answer must consist, not in talk and meditation, but in right action and in right conduct.

The existential vacuum which is the mass neurosis of the present time can be described as a private and personal form of nihilism; for nihilism can be defined as the contention that being has no meaning. As for psychotherapy, however, it will never be able to cope with this state of affairs on a mass scale if it does not keep itself free from the impact and influence of the contemporary trends of a nihilistic philosophy; otherwise it represents a symptom of the mass neurosis rather than its possible cure. Psychotherapy would not only reflect a nihilistic philosophy but also, even though unwillingly and unwittingly, transmit to the patient what is actually a caricature rather than a true picture of man.First of all, there is a danger inherent in the teaching of man\'s \\"nothingbutness,\\" the theory that man is nothing but the result of biological, psychological and sociological conditions, or the product of heredity and environment. such a view of man makes a neurotic believe what he is prone to believe anyway, namely, that he is the pawn and victim of outer influences or inner circumstances. This neurotic fatalism is fostered and strengthened by a psychotherapy which denies that man is free.To be sure, a human being is a finite thing and his freedom is restricted. It is not freedom from conditions, but it is freedom to take a stand toward the conditions. As I once put it: \\"As a professor in two fields, neurology and psychiatry, I am fully aware of the extent to which man is subject to biological, psychological and sociological conditions. But in addition to being a professor in two fields I am a survivor of four camps-concentration camps, that is-and as such I also bear witness to the unexpected extent to which man is capable of defying and braving even the worst conditions conceivable.","Es esta libertad espiritual, que no se nos puede arrebatar, lo que hace que la vida tenga sentido y prop\xf3sito","We came to meadows full of flowers. We saw and realized that they were there, but we had no feelings about them. The first spark of joy came when we saw a rooster with a tail of multicolored feathers. But it remained only a spark; we did not yet belonged to this world.","Such widespread phenomena as depression, aggression and addiction are not understandable unless we recognize the existential vacuum underlying them.","Logotherapy, keeping in mind the essential transitoriness of human existence, is not pessimistic but rather activistic. To express this point figuratively we might say: The pessimist resembles a man who observes with fear and sadness that his wall calendar, from which he daily tears a sheet, grows thinner with each passing day. On the other hand, the person who attacks the problems of life actively is like a man who removes each successive leaf from his calendar and files it neatly and carefully away with its predecessors, after first having jotted down a few diary notes on the back. He can reflect with pride and joy on all the richness set down in these notes, on all the life he has already lived to the fullest. What will it matter to him if he notices that he is growing old? Has he any reason to envy the young people whom he sees, or wax nostalgic over his own lost youth? What reasons has he to envy a young person? For the possibilities that a young person has, the future which is in store for him? \u201cNo, thank you, he will think. \u201cInstead of possibilities, I have realities in my past, not only the reality of work done and of love loved, but of sufferings bravely suffered. These sufferings are even the things of which I am most proud, though these are things which cannot inspire envy.\u201d","The pleasure principle is an artificial creation of psychology. Pleasure is not the goal of our aspirations, but the consequence of attaining them.","In view of the possibility of finding meaning in suffering, life\'s meaning is an unconditional one, at least potentially. That unconditional meaning, however, is paralleled by the unconditional value of each and every person. It is that which warrants the indelible quality of the dignity of man. Just as life remains potentially meaningful under any conditions, even those which are most miserable, so too does the value of each and every person stay with him or her, and it does so because it is based on the values that he or she has realized in the past, and is not contingent on the usefulness that he or she may or may not retain in the present.More specifically, this usefulness is usually defined in terms of functioning for the benefit of society. But today\'s society is characterized by achievement orientation, and consequently it adores people who are successful and happy and, in particular, it adores the young. It virtually ignores the value of those who are otherwise, and in so doing blurs the decisive difference between being valuable in the sense of dignity and being valuable in the sense of usefulness. If one is not cognizant of this difference and holds that na individual\'s value stems only from his present usefulness, then, believe me, one owes it only to personal inconsistency not to plead for euthanasia along the lines of Hitler\'s program, that is to say, \\"mercy\\" killing of all those who have lost their social usefulness, be it because of old age, incurable illness, mental deterioration, or whatever handicap they may suffer.Confounding the dignity of man with mere usefulness arises from a conceptual confusion that in turn may be traced back to the contemporary nihilism transmitted on many an academic campus and many an analytical couch. Even in the setting of training analyses such an indoctrination may take place. Nihilism does not contend that there is nothing, but it states that everything is meaningless. And George A. Sargent was right when he promulgated the concept of \\"learned meaninglessness.\\" He himself remembered a therapist who said, \\"George, you must realize that the world is a joke. There is no justice, everything is random. Only when you realize this will you understand how silly it is to take yourself seriously. There is no grand purpose in the universe. It just is. There\'s no particular meaning in what decision you make today about how to act.\\"One must generalize such a criticism. In principle, training is indispensable, but if so, therapists should see their task in immunizing the trainee against nihilism rather than inoculating him with the cynicism that is a defense mechanism against their own nihilism.","man\'s main concern is not to gain pleasure or to avoid pain but rather to see a meaning in his life.","\u0625\u0646 \u0627\u0644\u0627\u0646\u0641\u0639\u0627\u0644\u060c \u0648 \u0647\u0648 \u0641\u064a \u062c\u0648\u0647\u0631\u0647 \u0645\u0639\u0627\u0646\u0627\u0629\u060c \u064a\u062a\u0648\u0642\u0641 \u0639\u0646 \u0623\u0646 \u064a\u0643\u0648\u0646 \u0627\u0646\u0641\u0639\u0627\u0644\u0627\u064b \u0648 \u0645\u0639\u0627\u0646\u0627\u0629 \u062d\u0627\u0644\u0645\u0627 \u0646\u0643\u0648\u0651\u0646 \u0635\u0648\u0631\u0629 \u0648\u0627\u0636\u062d\u0629 \u0648 \u062f\u0642\u064a\u0642\u0629 \u0639\u0646\u0647\\"-\u0633\u0628\u064a\u0646\u0648\u0632\u0627","suffering ceases to be suffering at the moment it finds a meaning,","man who becomes conscious of the responsibility he bears toward a human being who affectionately waits for him, or to an unfinished work, will never be able to throw away his life.

Edith Weisskopf-Joelson observed in this context that the logotherapeutic \u201cnotion that experiencing can be as valuable as achieving is therapeutic because it compensates for our one-sided emphasis on the external world of achievement at the expense of the internal world of experience.6 Most important, however, is the third avenue to meaning in life: even the helpless victim of a hopeless situation, facing a fate he cannot change, may rise above himself, may grow beyond himself, and by so doing change himself. He may turn a personal tragedy into a triumph.\u201d","When man can\u2019t find meaning in his life, he distracts himself with pleasure.","Dostoevski said once, \\"There is only one thing that I dread: not to be worthy of my sufferings.","Live as if you were living already for the second time and as if you had acted the first time as wrongly as you are about to act now! It seems to me that there is nothing which would stimulate a man\u2019s sense of responsibleness more than this maxim, which invites him to imagine first that the present is past and, second, that the past may yet be changed and amended. Such a precept confronts him with life\u2019s finiteness as well as the finality of what he makes out of both his life and himself.\u201d","In contrast to most of the existentialist schools of thought, logotherapy is in no way pessimistic; but it is realistic in that it faces the tragic triad of human existence: pain, death, and guilt.","Just as the dignity of man is based on his freedom--to the extent that he may even say no to God--likewise, the dignity of a science is based on that unconditional freedom which guarantees its independent search for truth. And just as human freedom must include the freedom to say no, so the freedom of scientific investigation must face the risk that its results will turn out to contradict religious beliefs and convictions. Only a scientist who is ready to fight militantly for such an autonomy of thought may triumphantly live to see how the results of his research eventually fit, without contradictions, in the truths of his belief.","But happiness cannot be pursued; it must ensue.","\u0627\u0644\u0627\u0646\u0633\u0627\u0646 \u0648\u0641\u0642\u0627 \u0644\u062c\u0627\u0646 \u0628\u0648\u0644 \u0633\u0627\u0631\u062a\u0631, \u064a\u062e\u062a\u0631\u0639 \u0646\u0641\u0633\u0647, \u0648\u064a\u0635\u0645\u0645 \u062c\u0648\u0647\u0631\u0647, \u0627\u064a \u064a\u0628\u062a\u062f\u0639 \u0648\u064a\u0635\u0645\u0645 \u062d\u0642\u064a\u0642\u0629 \u0645\u0627\u0647\u064a\u062a\u0647, \u0628\u0645\u0627 \u0641\u064a \u0630\u0644\u0643 \u0645\u0627 \u064a\u0646\u0628\u063a\u064a \u0623\u0646 \u064a\u0643\u0648\u0646 \u0639\u0644\u064a\u0647 \u0623\u0648 \u064a\u0635\u064a\u0631 \u0628\u0647. \u0648\u0645\u0639 \u0630\u0644\u0643, \u0641\u0627\u0646\u064a \u0627\u0639\u062a\u0642\u062f \u0627\u0646 \u0645\u0639\u0646\u0649 \u0648\u062c\u0648\u062f\u0646\u0627 \u0644\u064a\u0633 \u0623\u0645\u0631\u0627 \u0646\u0628\u062a\u062f\u0639\u0647 \u0646\u062d\u0646 \u0627\u0646\u0641\u0633\u0646\u0627, \u0648\u0627\u0646\u0645\u0627 \u0647\u0648 \u0628\u0627\u0644\u0623\u062d\u0631\u0649 \u0623\u0645\u0631 \u0646\u0643\u062a\u0634\u0641\u0647 \u0648\u0646\u0633\u062a\u0628\u064a\u0646\u0647.","But one thing I beg of you; he continued, \u201cshave daily, if at all possible, even if you have to use a piece of glass to do it \u2026 even if you have to give your last piece of bread for it.

In a different connection, we have already spoken of the tendency there was to look into the past, to help make the present, with all its horrors, less real. But in robbing the present of its reality there lay a certain danger. It became easy to overlook the opportunities to make something positive of camp life, opportunities which really did exist. Regarding our \u201cprovisional existence as unreal was in itself an important factor in causing the prisoners to lose their hold on life; everything in a way became pointless. Such people forgot that often it is just such an exceptionally difficult external situation which gives man the opportunity to grow spiritually beyond himself. Instead of taking the camp\u2019s difficulties as a test of their inner strength, they did not take their life seriously and despised it as something of no consequence. They preferred to close their eyes and to live in the past. Life for such people became meaningless.\u201d","Don\u2019t aim at success\u2014the more you aim at it and make it a target, the more you are going to miss it. For success, like happiness, cannot be pursued; it must ensue, and it only does so as the unintended side-effect of one\u2019s dedication to a cause greater than oneself or as the by-product of one\u2019s surrender to a person other than oneself. Happiness must happen, and the same holds for success: you have to let it happen by not caring about it. I want you to listen to what your conscience commands you to do and go on to carry it out to the best of your knowledge.

The\u201d","If the man in the concentration camp did not struggle against this in a last effort to save his self-respect, he lost the feeling of being an individual, a being with a mind, with inner freedom and personal value. He thought of himself then as only a part of an enormous mass of people; his existence descended to the level of animal life.","being human always points, and is directed, to something, or someone, other than oneself\u2014be it a meaning to fulfill or another human being to encounter. The more one forgets himself\u2014by giving himself to a cause to serve or another person to love\u2014the more human he is and the more he actualizes himself","The truth-that love is the ultimate and highest goal to which one man aspire. I understood how a man who has nothing left in this world still may know bliss, be it only for a brief moment, in the contemplation of his beloved.","the mental reactions of the inmates of a concentration camp must seem more to us than the mere expression of certain physical and sociological conditions. Even though conditions such as lack of sleep, insufficient food and various mental stresses may suggest that the inmates were bound to react in certain ways, in the final analysis it becomes clear that the sort of person the prisoner became was the result of an inner decision, and not the result of camp influences alone. Fundamentally, therefore, any man can, even under such circumstances, decide what shall become of him-mentally and spiritually. He may retain his human dignity even in a concentration camp. Dostoevski said once, \\"There is only one thing that I dread: not to be worthy of my sufferings.\\" These words frequently came to my mind after I became acquainted with those martyrs whose behavior in camp, whose suffering and death, bore witness to the fact that the last inner freedom cannot be lost. It can be said that they were worthy of their sufferings; the way they bore their suffering was a genuine inner achievement. It is this spiritual freedom-which cannot be taken away-that makes life meaningful and purposeful.","No man and no destiny can be compared with any other man or any other destiny. No situation repeats itself, and each situation calls for a different response.","Even more powerful than fate is the courage that bears it steadfastly.","En \xfaltima instancia, vivir significa asumir la responsabilidad de encontrar la respuesta correcta a las cuestiones que la existencia nos plantea, cumplir con las obligaciones que la vida nos asigna a cada uno en cada instante particular.","\u0645\u0627 \u0647\u0648 \u0645\u062a\u0648\u0642\u0639 \u0645\u0646 \u0627\u0644\u062d\u064a\u0627\u0629 \u0644\u064a\u0633 \u0641\u064a \u0648\u0627\u0642\u0639 \u0627\u0644\u0623\u0645\u0631 \u0647\u0648 \u0645\u0648\u0636\u0639 \u0627\u0644\u0623\u0647\u0645\u064a\u0629\u060c \u0628\u0644 \u0623\u0646 \u0645\u0627 \u064a\u0639\u0646\u064a\u0646\u0627 \u0647\u0648 \u0645\u0627 \u062a\u062a\u0648\u0642\u0639\u0647 \u0627\u0644\u062d\u064a\u0627\u0629 \u0645\u0646\u0640\u0640\u0640\u0640\u0640\u0640\u0627","Sigmund Freud once asserted, \\"Let one attempt to expose a number of the most diverse people uniformly to hunger. With the increase of the imperative urge of hunger all individual differences will blur, and in their stead will appear the uniform expression of the one unstilled urge.\\" Thank heaven, Sigmund Freud was spared knowing the concentration camps from the inside. His subjects lay on a couch designed in the plush style of Victorian culture, not in the filth of Auschwitz. There, the \\"individual differences\\" did not \\"blur\\" but, on the contrary, people became more different; people unmasked themselves, both the swine and the saints. And today you need no longer hesitate to use the word \\"saints\\": think of Father Maximilian Kolbe who was starved and finally murdered by an injection of carbolic acid at Auschwitz and who in 1983 was canonized.You may be prone to blame for invoking examples that are the exceptions ot the rule. \\"Sed omnia praeclara tam difficilia quam rara sunt\\" (but everything great is just as difficult to realize as it is rare to find) reads the last sentence of the Ethics of Spinoza. You may of course ask whether we really need to refer to \\"saints.\\" Wouldn\'t it suffice just to refer to decent people? It is true that they form a minority . More than that, they always will remain a minority. And yet I see therein the very challenge to join the minority. For the world is in a bad state, but everything will become still worse unless each of us does his best.So let us be alert-alert in a twofold sense:Since Auschwitz we know what man is capable of.And since Hiroshima we know what is at stake.","The salvation of man is through love and in love.

It is as far removed from logical reasoning as it is from moral exhortation. To put it figuratively, the role played by a logotherapist is that of an eye specialist rather than that of a painter. A painter tries to convey to us a picture of the world as he sees it; an ophthalmologist tries to enable us to see the world as it really is. The logotherapist\u2019s role consists of widening and broadening the visual field of the patient so that the whole spectrum of potential meaning becomes conscious and visible to him.","When the impossibility of replacing a person is realized, it allows the responsibility which a man has for his existence and its continuance to appear in all its magnitude.","There is nothing in the world, I venture to say, that would so effectively help one to survive even the worst conditions, as the knowledge that there is a meaning in one\u2019s life.Nevertheless, say \\"yes\\" to life; A Psychologist Experiences the Concentration Camp","Again and again I therefore admonish my students both in Europe and in America: \u201cDon\u2019t aim at success\u2014the more you aim at it and make it a target, the more you are going to miss it.

I want you to listen to what your conscience commands you to do and go on to carry it out to the best of your knowledge. Then you will live to see that in the long run - in the long run I say! - success will follow you precisely because you had forgotten to think of it.","Suffering in and of itself is meaningless; we give our suffering meaning by the way in which we respond to it.","Not only our experiences, but all we have done, whatever great thoughts we may have had, and all we have suffered, all this is not lost, though it is past; we have brought it into being. Having been is also a kind of being, and perhaps the surest kind.","To discover that there was any semblance of art in a concentration camp must be surprise enough for an outsider, but he may be even more astonished to hear that one could find a sense of humor there as well; of course, only the faint trace of one, and then only for a few seconds or minutes. Humor was another of the soul\u2019s weapons in the fight for self-preservation. It is well known that humor, more than anything else in the human make-up, can afford an aloofness and an ability to rise above any situation, even if only for a few seconds.","Then I spoke of the many opportunities of giving life a meaning. I told my comrades (who lay motionless, although occasionally a sigh could be heard) that human life, under any circumstances, never ceases to have a meaning, and that this infinite meaning of life includes suffering and dying, privation and death. I asked the poor creatures who listened to me attentively in the darkness of the hut to face up to the seriousness of our position. They must not lose hope but should keep their courage in the certainty that the hopelessness of our struggle did not detract from its dignity and its meaning. I said that someone looks down on each of us in difficult hours- a friend, a wife, somebody alive or dead, or a God- and he would not expect us to disappoint him.

What is even more important, fate cannot be changed; otherwise it would not be fate. Man, however, may well change himself, otherwise he would not be man. It is a prerogative of being human, and a constituent of human existence, to be capable of shaping and reshaping oneself. In other words, it is a privilege of man to become guilty, and his responsibility to overcome guilt. [...] As Max Scheler also pointed out, man has a right to be considered guilty and to be punished. Once we deal with man as the victim of circumstances and their influences, we not only cease to treat him as a human being but also lame his will to change.","Has all this suffering, this dying around us, a meaning? For, if not, then ultimately there is no meaning to survival; for a life whose meaning depends upon such a happenstance - as whether one escapes or not - ultimately would not be worth living at all.","Man is not fully conditioned and determined but rather determines himself whether he gives in to conditions or stands up to them. In other words, man is ultimately self-determining.Man does not simply exist but always decides what his existence will be, what he will become in the next moment.","\u0648\u0642\u0641\u0646\u0627 \u062e\u0627\u0631\u062c \u0627\u0644\u0643\u0648\u062e, \u0648\u0623\u0628\u0635\u0631\u0646\u0627 \u0627\u0644\u0633\u062d\u0628 \u062a\u062a\u0642\u062f \u0641\u064a \u0627\u0644\u063a\u0631\u0648\u0628, \u0648\u0627\u0644\u0633\u0645\u0627\u0621 \u0643\u0644\u0647\u0627 \u062a\u062a\u0623\u0644\u0642 \u0628\u0627\u0644\u0633\u062d\u0628 \u0627\u0644\u062a\u064a \u064a\u062a\u063a\u064a\u0631 \u0623\u0634\u0643\u0627\u0644\u0647\u0627 \u0648\u0623\u0646\u0648\u0627\u0639\u0647\u0627 \u0628\u0627\u0633\u062a\u0645\u0631\u0627\u0631, \u0645\u0646 \u0627\u0644\u0644\u0648\u0646 \u0627\u0644\u0623\u0632\u0631\u0642 \u0627\u0644\u0645\u0634\u0648\u0628 \u0628\u0627\u0644\u0631\u0645\u0627\u062f\u064a \u0627\u0644\u0649 \u0627\u0644\u0644\u0648\u0646 \u0627\u0644\u0623\u062d\u0645\u0631 \u0627\u0644\u062f\u0645\u0648\u064a. \u0623\u0645\u0627 \u0645\u0646\u0638\u0631 \u0627\u0644\u0637\u064a\u0646 \u0627\u0644\u0643\u062b\u064a\u0628 \u0641\u0642\u062f \u0627\u0639\u0637\u0649 \u062a\u0646\u0627\u0642\u0636\u0627 \u062d\u0627\u062f\u0627, \u062d\u064a\u062b \u0643\u0627\u0646\u062a \u0627\u0644\u0645\u0633\u062a\u0646\u0642\u0639\u0627\u062a \u0627\u0644\u0645\u0646\u062a\u0634\u0631\u0629 \u0639\u0644\u0649 \u0627\u0644\u0623\u0631\u0636 \u0627\u0644\u0637\u064a\u0646\u064a\u0629 \u062a\u0639\u0643\u0633 \u0627\u0644\u0633\u0645\u0627\u0621 \u0627\u0644\u0645\u062a\u0623\u0644\u0642\u0629. \u0648\u0628\u0639\u062f \u062f\u0642\u0627\u0626\u0642 \u0645\u0646 \u0627\u0644\u0635\u0645\u062a, \u0642\u0627\u0644 \u0633\u062c\u064a\u0646 \u0644\u0622\u062e\u0631: \\"\u0643\u0645 \u064a\u0645\u0643\u0646 \u0627\u0646 \u062a\u0643\u0648\u0646 \u0627\u0644\u062f\u0646\u064a\u0627 \u062c\u0645\u064a\u0644\u0629!","The experiences of camp life show that man does have a choice of action.

In his opinion, the explanation for this increase did not lie in the harder working conditions or the deterioration of our food supplies or a change of weather or new epidemics. It was simply that the majority of the prisoners had lived in the na\xefve hope that they would be home again by Christmas. As the time drew near and there was no encouraging news, the prisoners lost courage and disappointment overcame them. This had a dangerous influence on their powers of resistance and a great number of them died.

tension between what one has already achieved and what one still ought to accomplish, or the gap between what one is and what one should become. Such a tension is inherent in the human being and therefore is indispensable to mental well-being. We should not, then, be hesitant about challenging man with a potential meaning for him to fulfill. It is only thus that we evoke his will to meaning from its state of latency. I consider it a dangerous misconception of mental hygiene to assume that what man needs in the first place is equilibrium or, as it is called in biology, \\"homeostasis,\\" i.e., a tensionless state. What man actually needs is not a tensionless state but rather the striving and struggling for a worthwhile goal, a freely chosen task. What he needs is not the discharge of tension at any cost but the call of a potential meaning waiting to be fulfilled by him. What man needs is not homeostasis but what i call \\"noo-dynamics,\\" i.e., the existential dynamics in a polar field of tension where one pole is represented by a meaning that is to be fulfilled and the other pole by the man who has to fulfill it.

Nietzsche\u2019s words, \u201cHe who has a why to live for can bear with almost any how, could be the guiding motto for all psychotherapeutic and psychohygienic efforts regarding prisoners. Whenever there was an opportunity for it, one had to give them a why\u2014an aim\u2014for their lives, in order to strengthen them to bear the terrible how of their existence. Woe to him who saw no more sense in his life, no aim, no purpose, and therefore no point in carrying on. He was soon lost. The typical reply with which such a man rejected all encouraging arguments was, \u201cI have nothing to expect from life any more.\u201d What sort of answer can one give to that?\u201d","Life in a concentration camp tore open the human souland exposed its depths. Is it surprising that in thosedepths we again found only human qualities which intheir very nature were a mixture of good and evil? Therift dividing good from evil, which goes through allhuman beings, reaches into the lowest depths and becomesapparent even on the bottom of the abyss which islaid open by the concentration camp.","The existential vacuum is a widespread phenomenon of the twentieth century. This is understandable; it may be due to a twofold loss which man has had to undergo since he became a truly human being. At the beginning of human history, man lost some of the basic animal instincts in which an animal\'s behavior is imbedded and by which it is secured. Such security, like Paradise, is closed to man forever; man has to make choices. In addition to this, however, man has suffered another loss in his more recent development inasmuch as the traditions which buttressed his behavior are now rapidly diminishing. No instinct tells him what he has to do, and no tradition tells him what he ought to do; sometimes he does not even know what he wishes to do. Instead, he either wishes to do what other people do (conformism) or he does what other people wish him to do (totalitarianism). A statistical survey recently revealed that amount my European students, 25 percent showed a more-or-less marked degree of existential vacuum. Among my American students it is not 25 but 60 percent.The existential vacuum manifests itself mainly in a state of boredom. now we can understand Schopenhauer when he said that mankind was apparently doomed to vacillate eternally between the two extremes of distress and boredom. In actual fact, boredom is now causing, and certainly bringing to psychiatrists, more problems to solve than distress. And these problems are growing increasingly crucial, for progressive automation will probably lead to an enormous increase in leisure hours available to the average worker. The pity of it is that many of these will not know what to do with all their newly acquired free time.","Occasionally I looked at the sky, where the stars were fading and the pink light of the morning was beginning to spread behind a dark bank of clouds. But my mind clung to my wife\u2019s image, imagining it with an uncanny acuteness. I heard her answering me, saw her smile, her frank and encouraging look. Real or not, her look was then more luminous than the sun which was beginning to rise. A thought transfixed me: for the first time in my life I saw the truth as it is set into song by so many poets, proclaimed as the final wisdom by so many thinkers. The truth\u2014that love is the ultimate and the highest goal to which man can aspire. Then I grasped the meaning of the greatest secret that human poetry and human thought and belief have to impart: The salvation of man is through love and in love. I understood how a man who has nothing left in this world still may know bliss, be it only for a brief moment, in the contemplation of his beloved. In a position of utter desolation, when man cannot express himself in positive action, when his only achievement may consist in enduring his sufferings in the right way \u2014an honorable way\u2014in such a position man can, through loving contemplation of the image he carries of his beloved, achieve fulfillment. For the first time in my life I was able to understand the meaning of the words, \u201cThe angels are lost in perpetual contemplation of an infinite glory.","people forgot that often it is just such an exceptionally difficult external situation which gives man the opportunity to grow spiritually beyond himself","\u0645\u0646 \u064a\u0645\u062a\u0644\u0643 \u0633\u0628\u0628\u0627\u064b \u064a\u0639\u064a\u0634 \u0645\u0646 \u0623\u062c\u0644\u0647 \u0641\u0625\u0646\u0647 \u064a\u0633\u062a\u0637\u064a\u0639 \u063a\u0627\u0644\u0628\u0627\u064b \u0623\u0646 \u064a\u062d\u062a\u0645\u0644 \u0628\u0623\u064a\u0629 \u0637\u0631\u064a\u0642\u0629 \u0648 \u0628\u0623\u064a \u062d\u0627\u0644... \u0641\u0627\u0644\u0648\u064a\u0644 \u0644\u0645\u0646 \u0644\u0627 \u064a\u0631\u0649 \u0641\u064a \u062d\u064a\u0627\u062a\u0647 \u0645\u0639\u0646\u0649\u060c \u0648\u0644\u0627 \u064a\u0633\u062a\u0634\u0639\u0631 \u0647\u062f\u0641\u0627\u064b \u0623\u0648 \u063a\u0631\u0636\u0627\u064b \u0644\u0647\u0627 \u0648 \u0645\u0646 \u062b\u0645 \u0644\u0627 \u064a\u062c\u062f \u0642\u064a\u0645\u0629 \u0641\u064a \u0645\u0648\u0627\u0635\u0644\u0629 \u0647\u0630\u0647 \u0627\u0644\u062d\u064a\u0627\u0629. \u0648 \u0633\u0631\u0639\u0627\u0646 \u0645\u0627 \u064a\u062d\u0633 \u0628\u0627\u0644\u0636\u064a\u0627\u0639","(What you have experienced, no power on earth can take from you.)

A man who could not see the end of his \\"provisional existence\\" was not able to aim at an ultimate goal in life. He ceased living for the future, in contrast to a man in normal life. Therefore the whole structure of his inner life changed; signs of decay set in which we know from other areas of life. The unemployed worker, for example, is in a similar position. His existence has become provisional and in a certain sense he cannot live for the future or aim at a goal. Research work done on unemployed miners has shown that they suffer from a peculiar sort of deformed time-inner time- which is a result of their unemployed state. Prisoners, too, suffered from this strange \\"time-experience.\\" In camp, a small time unit, a day, for example, filled with hourly tortures and fatigue, appeared endless. A larger time unit, perhaps a week, seemed to pass very quickly.

But Viktor Frankl chose to stay in his native Vienna after being freed and became head of neurology at a main hospital in Vienna. The Austrians he lived among often perplexed Frankl by saying they did not know a thing about the horrors of the camps he had barely survived. For Frankl, though, this alibi seemed flimsy. These people, he felt, had chosen not to know. Another survivor of the Nazis, the social psychologist Ervin Staub, was saved from a certain death by Raoul Wallenberg, the diplomat who made Swedish passports for thousands of desperate Hungarians, keeping them safe from the Nazis. Staub studied cruelty and hatred, and he found one of the roots of such evil to be the turning away, choosing not to see or know, of bystanders. That not-knowing was read by perpetrators as a tacit approval. But if instead witnesses spoke up in protest of evil, Staub saw, it made such acts more difficult for the evildoers. For Frankl, the \u201cnot-knowing he encountered in postwar Vienna was regarding the Nazi death camps scattered throughout that short-lived empire, and the obliviousness of Viennese citizens to the fate of their own neighbors who were imprisoned and died in those camps. The underlying motive for not-knowing, he points out, is to escape any sense of responsibility or guilt for those crimes. People in general, he saw, had been encouraged by their authoritarian rulers not to know\u2014a fact of life today as well. That same plea of innocence, I had no idea, has contemporary resonance in the emergence of an intergenerational tension. Young people around the world are angry at older generations for leaving as a legacy to them a ruined planet, one where the momentum of environmental destruction will go on for decades, if not centuries. This environmental not-knowing has gone on for centuries, since the Industrial Revolution. Since then we have seen the invention of countless manufacturing platforms and processes, most all of which came to be in an era when we had no idea of their ecological impacts. Advances in science and technology are making ecological impacts more transparent, and so creating options that address the climate crisis and, hopefully, will be pursued across the globe and over generations.

He was soon lost. The typical reply with which such a man rejected all encouraging arguments was, \u201cI have nothing to expect from life any more. What sort of answer can one give to that?What was really needed was a fundamental change in our attitude toward life. We had to learn ourselves and, furthermore, we had to teach the despairing men, that it did not really matter what we expected from life, but rather what life expected from us. We needed to stop asking about the meaning of life, and instead to think of ourselves as those who were being questioned by life \u2014 daily and hourly. Our answer must consist, not in talk and meditation, but in right action and in right conduct. Life ultimately means taking the responsibility to find the right answer to its problems and to fulfill the tasks which it constantly sets for each individual.These tasks, and therefore the meaning of life, differ from man to man, and from moment to moment. Thus it is impossible to define the meaning of life in a general way. Questions about the meaning of life can never be answered by sweeping statements. \u201cLife\u201d does not mean something vague, but something very real and concrete, just as life\u2019s tasks are also very real and concrete. They form man\u2019s destiny, which is different and unique for each individual. No man and no destiny can be compared with any other man or any other destiny. No situation repeats itself, and each situation calls for a different response. Sometimes the situation in which a man finds himself may require him to shape his own fate by action. At other times it is more advantageous for him to make use of an opportunity for contemplation and to realize assets in this way. Sometimes man may be required simply to accept fate, to bear his cross. Every situation is distinguished by its uniqueness, and there is always only one right answer to the problem posed by the situation at hand.\u201d","Don\u2019t aim at success\u2014the more you aim at it and make it a target, the more you are going to miss it.

Normally, sex is a mode of expression for love. Sex is justified, even sanctified, as soon as, but only as long as, it is a vehicle of love.

But I added that along with being a professor in two fields (neurology and psychiatry) I am a survivor of four camps (that is, concentration camps), and as such I also bear witness to the unexpected extent to which man is, and always remains, capable of resisting and braving even the worst conditions. To detach oneself from even the worst conditions is a uniquely human capability. [...] By virtue of this capacity man is capable of detaching himself not only from a situation but also from himself. He is capable of choosing his attitude toward himself. By doing so he really takes a stand toward his own somatic and psychic conditions and determinants. Understandably this is a crucial issue for psychotherapy and psychiatry, education and religion. For, seen in this light, a person is free to shape his own character, and man is responsible for what he may have made out of himself.","To draw an analogy: a man\u2019s suffering is similar to the behavior of gas.

When given free rein, his imagination played with past events, often not important ones, but minor happenings and trifling things. His nostalgic memory glorified them and they assumed a strange character.

A similar chain of events, however, can be observed in obsessive-compulsive cases in which the patient fights the ideas which haunt him. Thereby, however, he increases their power to disturb him, since pressure precipitates counter-pressure. Again the symptom is reinforced! On the other hand, as soon as the patient stops fighting his obsessions and instead tries to ridicule them by dealing with them in an ironical way-by applying paradoxical intention-the vicious circle is cut, the symptom diminishes and finally atrophies. In the fortunate case where there is no existential vacuum which invites and elicits the symptom, the patient will not only succeed in ridiculing his neurotic fear but finally will succeed in completely ignoring it.As we see, anticipatory anxiety has to be counteracted by paradoxical intention; hyper-intention as well as hyper-reflection have to be counteracted by dereflection; dereflection, however, ultimately is not possible except by the patient\'s orientation toward his specific vocation and mission in life. It is not the neurotic\'s self-concern, whether pity or contempt, which breaks the circle formation; the cue to cure is self-transcendence.","Every day, every hour, offered the opportunity to make a decision, a decision which determined whether you would or would not submit to those powers which threatened to rob you of your very self, your inner freedom; which determined whether or not you would become the plaything of circumstance, renouncing freedom and dignity to become molded into the form of the typical inmate.","By [anticipatory anxiety] I mean that the patient reacts to an event with a fearful expectation of its recurrence. However, fear tends to make happen precisely that which one fears, and so does anticipatory anxiety. Thus a vicious circle is established. A symptom evokes a phobia and the phobia provokes the symptom. The recurrence of the symptom then reinforces the phobia. The patient is caught in a cocoon. [\u2026] [Obsessive-compulsives] fear the potential effects or the potential cause of the strange thoughts. The phobic pattern of flight from fear is paralleled by the obsessive-compulsive pattern. Obsessive-compulsive neurotics also display fear. But theirs is not \'fear of fear\' but rather fear of themselves, and their response is to fight against obsessions and compulsions. But the more the patients fight, the stronger their symptoms become. In other words, alongside the circle formation built up by anticipatory anxiety in phobic cases, there is another feedback mechanism which we encounter in the obsessive-compulsive neurotic. Pressure induces counter-pressure, and counter-pressure, in turn, increases pressure. If one succeeds in making the patient stop fighting his obsessions and compulsions -- and this may well be accomplished by paradoxical intention -- these symptoms soon diminish and finally atrophy.","al hombre se le puede arrebatar todo salvo una cosa: la \xfaltima de las libertades humanas \u2014\u2015la elecci\xf3n de la actitud personal que debe adoptar frente al destino\u2014\u2015 para decidir su propio camino.","We who have come back, by the aid of many lucky chances or miracles\u2014whatever one may choose to call them\u2014we know: the best of us did not return.","The way that led from the acute mental tension of the last days in camp (from the war of nerves to mental peace) was certainly not free from obstacles. It would be an error to think that a liberated prisoner was not in need of spiritual care any more. We have to consider that a man who has been under such enormous mental pressure for such a long time is naturally in some danger after his liberation, especially since the pressure was released quite suddenly. This danger (in the sense of psychological hygiene) is the psychological counterpart of the bends. Just as the physical health of the caisson worker would be endangered if he left his diver\'s chamber suddenly (where he is under enormous atmospheric pressure), so the man who has suddenly been liberated from mental pressure can suffer damage to his moral and spiritual health.During this psychological phase one observed that people with natures of a more primitive kind could not escape the influences of the brutality which had surrounded them in camp life. Now, being free, they thought they could use their freedom licentiously and ruthlessly. The only thing that had changed for them was that they were now the oppressors instead of the oppressed. They became instigators, not objects, of willful force and injustice. They justified their behavior by their own terrible experiences.","He who has a strong enough why will find the how.","We give life meaning not only through our actions but also through loving and, finally, through suffering. Because how human beings deal with the limitation of their possibilities regarding how it affects their actions and their ability to love, how they behave under these restrictions\u2014the way in which they accept their suffering under such restrictions\u2014in all of this they still remain capable of fulfilling human values.","\xbfNo recuerda esto el viejo cuento Muerte en Teher\xe1n?

frightened of making decisions and of taking any sort of initiative whatsoever. This was the result of a strong feeling that fate was one\'s master, and that one must not try to influence it in any way, but instead let it take its own course. In addition, there was a great apathy, which contributed in no small part to the feelings of the prisoner. at times, lightning decisions had to be made, decisions which spelled life or death. The prisoner would have preferred to let fate make the choice for him. This escape from commitment was most apparent when a prisoner had to make the decision for or against an escape attempt. In those minutes in which he had to make up his mind-and it was always a question of minutes-he suffered the tortures of Hell. Should he make the attempt to flee?

It finds its deepet meaning in his spiritual being, his inner self.","success will follow you precisely because you had forgotten to think of it.","For the meaning of life differs from man to man, from day to day and from hour to hour.

In both cases it was a question of getting them to realize that life was still expecting something from them; something in the future was expected of them. We found, in fact, that for the one it was his child whom he adored and who was waiting for him in a foreign country. For the other it was a thing, not a person.

His work could not be done by anyone else, any more than another person could ever take the place of the father in his child\u2019s affections. This uniqueness and singleness which distinguishes each individual and gives a meaning to his existence has a bearing on creative work as much as it does on human love. When the impossibility of replacing a person is realized, it allows the responsibility which a man has for his existence and its continuance to appear in all its magnitude. A man who becomes conscious of the responsibility he bears toward a human being who affectionately waits for him, or to an unfinished work, will never be able to throw away his life.

The greatest task for any person is to find meaning in his or her life. Frankl saw three possible sources for meaning: in work (doing something significant), in love (caring for another person), and in courage during difficult times. Suffering in and of itself is meaningless; we give our suffering meaning by the way in which we respond to it. At one point, Frankl writes that a person \u201cmay remain brave, dignified and unselfish, or in the bitter fight for self-preservation he may forget his human dignity and become no more than an animal. He concedes that only a few prisoners of the Nazis were able to do the former, \u201cbut even one such example is sufficient proof that man\u2019s inner strength may raise him above his outward fate.\u201d","Success, like happiness, cannot be pursued. It must ensue.

He","Along with unemployment neurosis, which is triggeredby an individual\'s socioeconomic situation,there are other types of depression which are traceableback to psychodynamic or biochemical conditions,whichever the case may be. Accordingly, psychotherapyand pharmacotherapy are indicated respectively.Insofar as the feeling of meaninglessness is concerned,however, we should not overlook and forget that, per se,it is not a matter of pathology; rather than being the sign and symptom of a neurosis, it is, I would say, the proofof one\'s humanness. But although it is not caused byanything pathological, it may well cause a pathologicalreaction; in other words, it is potentially pathogenic. Justconsider the mass neurotic syndrome so pervasive in theyoung generation: there is ample empirical evidence thatthe three facets of this syndrome - depression, aggression,addiction - are due to what is called in logotherapy\\"the existential vacuum,\\" a feeling of emptiness andmeaninglessness.","You may of course ask whether we really need to refer to \\"saints.\\" Wouldn\'t it suffice just to refer to decent people?

But there is also purpose in that life which is almost barren of both creation and enjoyment and which admits of but one possibility of high moral behavior: namely, in man\u2019s attitude to his existence, an existence restricted by external forces. A creative life and a life of enjoyment are banned to him. But not only creativeness and enjoyment are meaningful. If there is a meaning in life at all, then there must be a meaning in suffering.

He could not overcome the loss of his wife who had died two years before and whom he had loved above all else. Now, how could I help him? What should I tell him? Well, I refrained from telling him anything but instead confronted him with the question, \u201cWhat would have happened, Doctor, if you had died first, and your wife would have had to survive you? \u201cOh,\u201d he said, \u201cfor her this would have been terrible; how she would have suffered!\u201d Whereupon I replied, \u201cYou see, Doctor, such a suffering has been spared her, and it was you who have spared her this suffering\u2014to be sure, at the price that now you have to survive and mourn her.\u201d He said no word but shook my hand and calmly left my office.

Had I known then that my wife was dead, I think that I would still have given myself, undisturbed by that knowledge, to the contemplation of her image, and that my mental conversation with her would have been just as vivid and just as satisfying. \'Set me like a seal upon thy heart, love is as strong as death.","Of course, this was no therapy in the proper sense since, first, his despair was no disease; and second, I could not change his fate; I could not revive his wife.

Again and again I therefore admonish my students both in Europe and in America: \\"Don\'t aim at success-the more you aim at it and make it a target, the more you are going to miss it. For success, like happiness, cannot be pursued; it must ensue, and it only does so as the unintended side-effect of one\'s dedication to a cause greaterthan oneself or as the by-product of one\'s surrender to a person other than oneself. Happiness must happen, and the same holds for success: you have to let it happen by not caring about it. I want you to listen to what your conscience commands you to do and go on to carry it out to the best of your knowledge. Then you will live to see that in the long run-in the long run, I say!-success will follow you precisely because you had forgotten to think of it.","Nietzsche\u2019s words, \u201cHe who has a why to live for can bear with almost any how, could be the guiding motto for all psychotherapeutic and psychohygienic efforts regarding prisoners.

Yet it is possible to practice the art of living even in a concentration camp, although suffering is omnipresent. To draw an analogy: a man\u2019s suffering is similar to the behavior of gas. If a certain quantity of gas is pumped into an empty chamber, it will fill the chamber completely and evenly, no matter how big the chamber. Thus suffering completely fills the human soul and conscious mind, no matter whether the suffering is great or little. Therefore the \u201csize of human suffering is absolutely relative. It also follows that a very trifling thing can cause the greatest of joys. Take as an example something that happened on our journey from Auschwitz to the camp affiliated with Dachau. We had all been afraid that our transport was heading for the Mauthausen camp. We became more and more tense as we approached a certain bridge over the Danube which the train would have to cross to reach Mauthausen, according to the statement of experienced traveling companions. Those who have never seen anything similar cannot possibly imagine the dance of joy performed in the carriage by the prisoners when they saw that our transport was not crossing the bridge and was instead heading \u201conly\u201d for Dachau. And again, what happened on our arrival in that camp, after a journey lasting two days and three nights? There had not been enough room for everybody to crouch on the floor of the carriage at the same time. The majority of us had to stand all the way, while a few took turns at squatting on the scanty straw which was soaked with human urine. When we arrived the first important news that we heard from older prisoners was that this comparatively small camp (its population was 2,500) had no \u201coven,\u201d no crematorium, no gas! That meant that a person who had become a \u201cMoslem\u201d could not be taken straight to the gas chamber, but would have to wait until a so-called \u201csick convoy\u201d had been arranged to return to Auschwitz. This joyful surprise put us all in a good mood. The wish of the senior warden of our hut in Auschwitz had come true: we had come, as quickly as possible, to a camp which did not have a \u201cchimney\u201d\u2014unlike Auschwitz. We laughed and cracked jokes in spite of, and during, all we had to go through in the next few hours.\u201d","This uniqueness and singleness which distinguishes each individual and gives a meaning to his existence has a bearing on creative work as much as it does on human love.

From all this follows that life always offers us a possibility for the fulfillment of meaning, therefore there is always the option that it has a meaning. One could also say that our human existence can be made meaningful \u201cto the very last breath; as long as we have breath, as long as we are still conscious, we are each responsible for answering life\u2019s questions.\u201d","(...) can life retain its potential meaning in spite of its tragic aspects? After all, \'saying yes to life in spite of everything,\' (...) presupposes that life is potentially meaningful under any conditions, even those which are most miserable. And this in turn presupposes the human capacity to creatively turn life\u2019s negative aspects into something positive or constructive. In other words, what matters is to make the best of any given situation.","Man can preserve a vestige of spiritual freedom, of independence of mind, even in such terrible conditions of psychic and physical stress.","Forthe meaning of life differs from man to man, from day to day and from hour to hour. What matters, therefore, is not the meaning of life in general but rather the specific meaning of a person\u2019s life at a given moment.","Man\u2019s search for meaning is the primary motivation in his life","Si existe Dios, estoy convencido de que no tomar\xe1 a mal que alguien lo intercambie con el propio Yo y se dirija a \xc9l como a un T\xfa.","Ultimately, man should not ask what the meaning of his life is, but rather he must recognize that it is he who is asked. In a word, each man is questioned by life; and he can only answer to life by answering for his own life; to life he can only respond by being responsible. Thus, logotherapy sees in responsibleness the very essence of human existence.","There is nothing in the world, I venture to say, that would so effectively help one to survive even the worst conditions as the knowledge that there is a meaning in one\'s life. There is much wisdom in the words of Nietzsche: \\"He who has a why to live for can bear almost any how","loss of hope and courage can have a deadly effect.","If one cannot change a situation that causes his suffering, he can still choose his attitude.","For the meaning of life differs from man to man, from day to day and from hour to hour. What matters, therefore, is not the meaning of life in general but rather the specific meaning of a person\u2019s life at a given moment. To put the question in general terms would be comparable to the question posed to a chess champion: \u201cTell me, Master, what is the best move in the world? There simply is no such thing as the best or even a good move apart from particular situation in a game and the particular personality of one\u2019s opponent. The same holds for human existence. One should not search for an abstract meaning of life. Everyone has his own specific vocation or mission in life to carry out a concrete assignment which demands fulfillment. Therein he cannot be replaced, nor can his life be repeated. Thus, everyone\u2019s task is as unique as is his specific opportunity to implement it.\u201d","for the first time in my life I saw the truth as it is set into song by so many poets, proclaimed as the final wisdom by so many thinkers.

Therefore, remember: shave, stand and walk smartly; then you need not be afraid of gas","If there is a meaning in life at all, then there must be a meaning in suffering.","One must have a reason to \\"be happy.\\" Once the reason is found, however, one becomes happy automatically. As we see, a human being is not one in pursuit of happiness but rather in search of a reason to become happy, last but not least, through actualizing the potential meaning inherent and dormant in a given situation. This need for a reason is similar in another specifically human phenomenon - laughter. If you want anyone to laugh you have to provide him with a reason, e.g., you have to tell him a joke. In no way is it possible to evoke real laughter by urging him, or having him urge himself to laugh.","At such a moment it is not the physical pain which hurts the most, it is the mental agony caused by injustice, the unreasonableness of it all.","Thus suffering completely fills the human soul and conscious mind, no matter whether the suffering is great or little.","Life is not primarily a quest for pleasure, as Freud believed, or a quest for power, as Alfred Adler taught, but a quest for meaning. The greatest task for any person is to find meaning in his or her life. Frankl saw three possible sources for meaning: in work (doing something significant), in love (caring for another person), and in courage during difficult times. Suffering in and of itself is meaningless; we give our suffering meaning by the way in which we respond to it. At one point, Frankl writes that a person \u201cmay remain brave, dignified and unselfish, or","To say yes to life is not only meaningful under all circumstances--because life itself is--but it is also possible under all circumstances.","Man is that being which invented the gas chambers; but he is at the same time that being which walked with head held high into these very same gas chambers, the Lord\'s Prayer or the Jewish prayer for the dead on his lips.","we know: the best of us did not return.","man is that being who invented the gas chambers of Auschwitz; however, he is also that being who entered those gas chambers upright, with the Lord\u2019s Prayer or the Shema Yisrael on his lips.","Love goes very far beyond the physical person of the beloved. It finds its deepest meaning in his spiritual being, his inner self. Whether or not he is actually present, whether or not he is still alive at all, ceases somehow to be of importance.

Pero tambi\xe9n atesora sentido una vida exenta de creaci\xf3n o contemplaci\xf3n, que solo admite una \xfanica capacidad de respuesta: la actitud de mantenerse erguido ante su inexorable destino, como por ejemplo en un campo de concentraci\xf3n. En esas condiciones, al hombre se le niega el valor de la creaci\xf3n o de la vivencia, pero aun as\xed la vida ofrece un sentido. De manera que todos los aspectos de la vida son significativos; tambi\xe9n el sufrimiento. Si hay un sentido en la vida, entonces debe haber un sentido en el sufrimiento. La experiencia indica que el sufrimiento es parte sustancial de la vida, como el destino y la muerte.

And they smugly smiled. \'But do not forget,\' I added, \'that the Americans have retained their freedom also to choose their tasks, a freedom which sometimes seems to me to be denied to you.\' They stopped smiling. How fine it would be to synthesize East and West, to blend tasks with freedom. Freedom then could fully develop. It really is a negative concept which requires a positive complement. And the positive complement is responsibleness. [...] Freedom threatens to degenerate into mere arbitrariness unless it is lived in terms of responsibleness.

Human kindness can be found in all groups, even those which as a whole it would be easy to condemn. The boundaries between groups overlapped and we must not try to simplify matters by saying that these men were angels and those were devils. Certainly, it was a considerable achievement for a guard or foreman to be kind to the prisoners in spite of all the camp\'s influences, and, on the other hand, the baseness of a prisoner who treated his own companions badly was exceptionally contemptible.

As each situation in life represents a challenge to man and presents a problem for him to solve, the question of the meaning of life may actually be reversed. Ultimately, man should not ask what the meaning of his life is, but rather he must recognize that it is he who is asked.

However,precisely such tension is an indispensable prerequisiteof mental health. There is nothing in the world, Iventure to say, that would so effectively help one tosurvive even the worst conditions as the knowledgethat there is a meaning in one\'s life. There is muchwisdom in the words of Nietzsche: \\"He who has a whyto live for can bear almost any how.\\" I can see in thesewords a motto which holds true for any psychotherapy.In the Nazi concentration camps, one could havewitnessed that those who knew that there was a taskwaiting for them to fulfill were most apt to survive.The same conclusion has since been reached by otherauthors of books on concentration camps, and also bypsychiatric investigations into Japanese, North Koreanand North Vietnamese prisoner-of-war camps.","We had to strive to lead them back to this truth, or the consequences would have been much worse than the loss of a few thousand stalks of oats.","En general lograban sobrevivir solo aquellos prisioneros que, endurecidos tras a\xf1os de deambular por distintos campos, hab\xedan perdido todos los escr\xfapulos en su lucha por la supervivencia, y para salvarse recurr\xedan a cualquier medio, honrado o deshonroso, sirvi\xe9ndose incluso de la fuerza bruta, el robo o la traici\xf3n a sus amigos.

You always think that the worst is yet to come, & yet it is over already.","once lost, the will to live seldom returned.","Thus it can be seen that mental health is based on acertain degree of tension, the tension between whatone has already achieved and what one still ought toaccomplish, or the gap between what one is and whatone should become. Such a tension is inherent in thehuman being and therefore is indispensable to mentalwell-being. We should not, then, be hesitant aboutchallenging man with a potential meaning for him tofulfill. It is only thus that we evoke his will to meaningfrom its state of latency. I consider it a dangerousmisconception of mental hygiene to assume that whatman needs in the first place is equilibrium or, as it iscalled in biology, \\"homeostasis,\\" i.e., a tensionlessstate. What man actually needs is not a tensionlessstate but rather the striving and struggling for aworthwhile goal, a freely chosen task. What he needs isnot the discharge of tension at any cost but the call of apotential meaning waiting to be fulfilled by him. Whatman needs is not homeostasis but what I call \\"no\xf6dynamics,\\"i.e., the existential dynamics in a polarfield of tension where one pole is represented by ameaning that is to be fulfilled and the other pole by theman who has to fulfill it. And one should not think thatthis holds true only for normal conditions; in neuroticindividuals, it is even more valid. If architects want tostrengthen a decrepit arch, they increase the loadwhich is laid upon it, for thereby the parts are joined more firmly together. So if therapists wish to fostertheir patients\' mental health, they should not be afraidto create a sound amount of tension through a reorientationtoward the meaning of one\'s life.","To compare yourself with anyone else is to do an injustice either to yourself or to the other person. [...] For everyone has a different kind of start. But the person whose start was more difficult, whose fate was less kind, can be credited with the greater personal achievement, other things being equal. Since, however, all aspects of the situation imposed by fate can never be assessed, there is simply no basis and no standard for a comparison of achievements.","A man\u2019s concern, even his despair, over the worthwhileness of life is an existential distress but by no means a mental disease.

I understood how a man who has nothing left in this world still may know bliss, be it only for a brief moment, in the contemplation of his beloved.","For success, like happiness, cannot be pursued; it must ensue, and it only does so as the unintended side-effect of one\'s dedication to a cause greater than oneself.","He who has a why to live for can bear almost any how. I can see in these words a motto which holds true for any psychotherapy. In the Nazi concentration camps, one could have witnessed that those who knew that there was a task waiting for them to fulfill were most apt to survive. The same conclusion has since been reached by other authors of books on concentration camps, and also by psychiatric investigations into Japanese, North Korean and North Vietnamese prisoner-of-war camps.\u201d","Apathy, the blunting of the emotions and the feeling that one could not care any more, were the symptoms arising during the second stage of the prisoner\u2019s psychological reactions,","I remember a personal experience. Almost in tears from pain (I had terrible sores on my feet from wearing torn shoes), I limped a few kilometers with our long column of men from the camp to our work site. Very cold, bitter winds struck us. I kept thinking of the endless little problems of our miserable life. What would there be to eat tonight? If a piece of sausage came as extra ration, should I exchange it for a piece of bread? Should I trade my last cigarette, which was left from a bonus I received a fortnight ago, for a bowl of soup? How could I get a piece of wire to replace the fragment which served as one of my shoelaces? Would I get to our work site in time to join my usual working party or would I have to join another, which might have a brutal foreman? What could I do to get on good terms with the Capo, who could help me to obtain work in camp instead of undertaking this horribly long daily march? I became disgusted with the state of affairs which compelled me, daily and hourly, to think of only such trivial things. I forced my thoughts to turn to another subject. Suddenly I saw myself standing on the platform of a well-lit, warm and pleasant lecture room. In front of me sat an attentive audience on comfortable upholstered seats. I was giving a lecture on the psychology of the concentration camp! All that oppressed me at that moment became objective, seen and described from the remote viewpoint of science. By this method I succeeded somehow in rising above the situation, above the sufferings of the moment, and I observed them as if they were already of the past. Both I and my troubles became the object of an interesting psychoscientific study undertaken by myself. What does Spinoza say in his Ethics? \u2014\u201cAffectus, qui passio est, desinit esse passio simulatque eius claram et distinctam formamus ideam. Emotion, which is suffering, ceases to be suffering as soon as we form a clear and precise picture of it.\u201d","Vivir significa asumir la responsabilidad de encontrar la respuesta correcta a las cuestiones que la existencia nos plantea, cumplir con las obligaciones que la vida nos asigna a cada uno en cada instante particular.","The first is by creating a work or by doing a deed. The second is by experiencing something or encountering someone; in other words, meaning can be found not only in work but also in love.","So conscience is essentially intuitive. To anticipate what is not yet, but is to be made real, conscience must be based on intuition. And it is in this sense that consciencemay be called irrational.","To put it figuratively, the role played by a logotherapist is that of an eye specialist rather than that of a painter. A painter tries to convey to us a picture of the world as he sees it; an ophthalmologist tries to enable us to see the world as it really is. The logotherapist\u2019s role consists of widening and broadening the visual field of the patient so that the whole spectrum of potential meaning becomes conscious and visible to him.","It is one of the basic tenets of logotherapythat man\'s main concern is not to gain pleasure or toavoid pain but rather to see a meaning in his life. Thatis why man is even ready to suffer, on the condition, tobe sure, that his suffering has a meaning.","there is also purpose in that life which is almost barren of both creation and enjoyment and which admits of but one possibility of high moral behavior: namely, in man\u2019s attitude to his existence, an existence restricted by external forces. A creative life and a life of enjoyment are banned to him. But not only creativeness and enjoyment are meaningful. If there is a meaning in life at all, then there must be a meaning in suffering. Suffering is an ineradicable part of life, even as fate and death. Without suffering and death human life cannot be complete.","Having been is the surest kind of being.","\u0641\u064a \u0623\u062d\u062f \u0627\u0644\u0623\u064a\u0627\u0645 \u0628\u0639\u062f \u0641\u062a\u0631\u0629 \u0642\u0644\u064a\u0644\u0629 \u0645\u0646 \u0627\u0644\u0625\u0641\u0631\u0627\u062c\u060c \u0643\u0646\u062a \u0623\u0633\u064a\u0631 \u0641\u064a \u0627\u0644\u0645\u062f\u064a\u0646\u0629 \u0628\u062c\u0648\u0627\u0631 \u0627\u0644\u0645\u0631\u0648\u062c \u0627\u0644\u063a\u0646\u064a\u0629 \u0628\u0627\u0644\u0632\u0647\u0648\u0631\u060c \u0648\u0644\u0639\u062f\u0629 \u0623\u0645\u064a\u0627\u0644\u060c \u0635\u0648\u0628 \u0633\u0648\u0642 \u0627\u0644\u0645\u062f\u064a\u0646\u0629 \u0628\u0627\u0644\u0642\u0631\u0628 \u0645\u0646 \u0627\u0644\u0645\u0639\u0633\u0643\u0631. \u0648\u0643\u0627\u0646\u062a \u0627\u0644\u0637\u064a\u0648\u0631 \u062a\u062d\u0644\u0642 \u0641\u064a \u0627\u0644\u0633\u0645\u0627\u0621\u060c \u0648\u0623\u0633\u0645\u0639 \u063a\u0646\u0627\u0621\u0647\u0627 \u0627\u0644\u0630\u064a \u0628\u064a\u0639\u062b \u0639\u0644\u0649 \u0627\u0644\u0628\u0647\u062c\u0629. \u0644\u0645 \u064a\u0643\u0646 \u0647\u0646\u0627\u0643 \u0623\u064a \u0634\u062e\u0635 \u064a\u0645\u0643\u0646 \u0631\u0624\u064a\u062a\u0647 \u0644\u0639\u062f\u0629 \u0623\u0645\u064a\u0627\u0644 \u0645\u0646 \u062d\u0648\u0644\u064a\u061b \u0644\u0645 \u064a\u0643\u0646 \u0647\u0646\u0627\u0643 \u0623\u064a \u0634\u0626 \u0639\u062f\u0627 \u0627\u0644\u0623\u0631\u0636 \u0648\u0627\u0644\u0633\u0645\u0627\u0621 \u0627\u0644\u0645\u062a\u0631\u0627\u0645\u062a\u064a\u0646 \u0648\u062a\u063a\u0631\u064a\u062f \u0627\u0644\u0637\u064a\u0648\u0631 \u0648\u0631\u062d\u0627\u0628\u0629 \u0627\u0644\u0641\u0636\u0627\u0621. \u062a\u0648\u0642\u0641\u062a\u060c \u0648\u0646\u0638\u0631\u062a \u0645\u0646 \u062d\u0648\u0644\u064a \u0648\u062a\u0637\u0644\u0639\u062a \u0627\u0644\u0649 \u0627\u0644\u0633\u0645\u0627\u0621 -

If a certain quantity of gas is pumped into an empty chamber, it will fill the chamber completely and evenly, no matter how big the chamber.

Frankl\u2019s wisdom here is worth emphasizing: it is a question of the attitude one takes toward life\u2019s challenges and opportunities, both large and small. A positive attitude enables a person to endure suffering and disappointment as well as enhance enjoyment and satisfaction. A negative attitude intensifies pain and deepens disappointments; it undermines and diminishes pleasure, happiness, and satisfaction; it may even lead to depression or physical illness.","\xabNing\xfan poder de la tierra podr\xe1 arrancarte lo que has vivido\xbb.","Thus it can be seen that mental health is based on a certain degree of tension, the tension between what one has already achieved and what one still ought to accomplish, or the gap between what one is and what one should become. Such a tension is inherent in the human being and therefore is indispensable to mental well-being. We should not, then, be hesitant about challenging man with a potential meaning for him to fulfill.","An active life serves the purpose of giving man the opportunity to realize values in creative work, while a passive life of enjoyment affords him the opportunity to obtain fulfillment in experiencing beauty, art, or nature. But there is also purpose in that life which is almost barren of both creation and enjoyment and which admits of but one possibility of high moral behavior: namely, in man\u2019s attitude to his existence, an existence restricted by external forces. A creative life and a life of enjoyment are banned to him. But not only creativeness and enjoyment are meaningful. If there is a meaning in life at all, then there must be a meaning in suffering. Suffering is an ineradicable part of life, even as fate and death. Without suffering and death human life cannot be complete. The way in which a man accepts his fate and all the suffering it entails, the way in which he takes up his cross, gives him ample opportunity\u2014even under the most difficult circumstances\u2014to add a deeper meaning to his life. It may remain brave, dignified and unselfish. Or in the bitter fight for self-preservation he may forget his human dignity and become no more than an animal. Here lies the chance for a man either to make use of or to forgo the opportunities of attaining the moral values that a difficult situation may afford him. And this decides whether he is worthy of his sufferings or not.","Une vie active permet \xe0 l\u2019homme de r\xe9aliser ses valeurs \xe0 travers un travail cr\xe9atif, tandis que celui qui m\xe8ne une vie passive et qui vit pour son plaisir peut faire l\u2019exp\xe9rience de la beaut\xe9, de l\u2019art, ou de la nature.","If, thus, a strong meaning orientation plays a decisiverole in the prevention of suicide, what aboutintervention in cases in which there is a suicide risk?As a young doctor I spent four years in Austria\'slargest state hospital where I was in charge of thepavilion in which severely depressed patients wereaccommodated - most of them having been admittedafter a suicide attempt. I once calculated that I musthave explored twelve thousand patients during thosefour years. What accumulated was quite a store ofexperience from which I still draw whenever I amconfronted with someone who is prone to suicide. I explain to such a person that patients have repeatedlytold me how happy they were that the suicide attempthad not been successful; weeks, months, years later,they told me, it turned out that there was a solution totheir problem, an answer to their question, a meaningto their life. \\"Even if things only take such a good turnin one of a thousand cases,\\" my explanation continues,\\"who can guarantee that in your case it will nothappen one day, sooner or later?

Tobegin with, I would like to clarify that, in the firstplace, the logotherapist is concerned with the potentialmeaning inherent and dormant in all the single situationsone has to face throughout his or her life. Therefore,I will not be elaborating here on the meaning ofone\'s life as a whole, although I do not deny that sucha long-range meaning does exist. To invoke an analogy,consider a movie: it consists of thousands uponthousands of individual pictures, and each of themmakes sense and carries a meaning, yet the meaning ofthe whole film cannot be seen before its last sequenceis shown. However, we cannot understand the wholefilm without having first understood each of its components,each of the individual pictures. Isn\'t it the samewith life? Doesn\'t the final meaning of life, too, revealitself, if at all, only at its end, on the verge of death?And doesn\'t this final meaning, too, depend onwhether or not the potential meaning of each singlesituation has been actualized to the best of the respectiveindividual\'s knowledge and belief?","Happiness cannot be pursued; it must ensue. One must have a reason to \\"be happy\\". Once the reason is found, however, one becomes happy automatically.

We must also show him that the task he is responsible for is always a specific task. It is specific in a twin sense: one, that the task varies from person to person\u2014in accord with the uniqueness of each person. Two, that it changes from hour to hour, in accord with the singularity of every situation. We need only remind ourselves of what Scheler has called \u201csituational values\u201d in contrast to the \u201ceternal\u201d values which are valid at all times and for everyone. In a sense these situational values are always there, waiting until their hour strikes and a man seizes the single opportunity to actualize them. If that opportunity is missed, they are irrevocably lost; the situational value remains forever unrealized.

Logotherapyconceives of conscience as a prompterwhich, if need be, indicates the direction in which wehave to move in a given life situation. In order to carryout such a task, conscience must apply a measuringstick to the situation one is confronted with, and thissituation has to be evaluated in the light of a set ofcriteria, in the light of a hierarchy of values. Thesevalues, however, cannot be espoused and adopted byus on a conscious level - they are something that weare. They have crystallized in the course of the evolutionof our species; they are founded on our biological past and are rooted in our biological depth.

Suffering is an ineradicable part of life, even as fate and death. Without suffering and death human life cannot be complete. The way in which a man accepts his fate and all the suffering it entails, the way in which he takes up his cross, gives him ample opportunity\u2014even under the most difficult circumstances\u2014to add a deeper meaning to his life. It may remain brave, dignified and unselfish. Or in the bitter fight for self-preservation he may forget his human dignity and become no more than an animal. Here lies the chance for a man either to make use of or to forgo the opportunities of attaining the moral values that a difficult situation may afford him. And this decides whether he is worthy of his sufferings or not.","An active life serves the purpose of giving man the opportunity to realize values in creative work, while a passive life of enjoyment affords him the opportunity to obtain fulfilment in experiencing beauty, art, or nature. But there is also purpose in that life which is almost barren of both creation and enjoyment and which admits of but one possibility of high moral behavior: namely, in man\u2019s attitude to his existence, an existence restricted by external forces. A creative life and a life of enjoyment are banned to him. But not only creativeness and enjoyment are meaningful. If there is a meaning in life at all, then there must be a meaning in sufering. Sufering is an ineradicable part of life, even as fate and death. Without sufering and death human life cannot be complete.","As we see, the priority stays with creatively changingthe situation that causes us to suffer. But thesuperiority goes to the \\"know-how to suffer,\\" if needbe. And there is empirical evidence that - literally -the \\"man in the street\\" is of the same opinion. Austrianpublic-opinion pollsters recently reported thatthose held in highest esteem by most of the peopleinterviewed are neither the great artists nor the greatscientists, neither the great statesmen nor the greatsports figures, but those who master a hard lot withtheir heads held high.","They must not lose hope but should keep their courage in the certainty that the hopelessness of our struggle did not detract from its dignity and its meaning.","far we have shown that the meaning of life always changes, but that it never ceases to be.

This neurotic fatalism is fostered and strengthened by a psychotherapy which denies that man is free.To be sure, a human being is a finite thing, and his freedom is restricted.

We may predict the movements of a machine, of an automaton; more than this, we may even try to predict the mechanisms or \u201cdynamisms of the human psyche as well. But man is more than psyche.\u201d","I mentioned earlier how everything that was not connected with the immediate task of keeping oneself and one\'s closest friends alive lost its value. Everything was sacrificed to this end. A man\'s character became involved to the point that he was caught in a mental turmoil which threatened all the values he held and threw them into doubt. Under the influence of a world which no longer recognized the value of human life and human dignity, which had robbed man of his will and had made him an object to be exterminated (having planned, however, to make full use of him first-to the last ounce of his physical resources)-under this influence the personal ego finally suffered a loss of values. If the man in the concentration camp did not struggle against this in a last effort to save his self-respect, he lost the feeling of being an individual, a being with a mind, with inner freedom and personal value. He thought of himself then as only a part of an enormous mass of people; his existence descended to the level of animal life. The men were herded-sometimes to one place then to another; sometimes driven together, then apart-like a flock of sheep without a thought or a will of their own. A small but dangerous pack watched them from all sides, well versed in methods of torture and sadism. They drove the herd incessantly, backwards an forwards, with shouts, kicks and blows. And we, the sheep, thought of two things only-how to evade the bad dogs and how to get a little food.","Man\u2019s search for meaning is the primary motivation in his life and not a \u201csecondary rationalization of instinctual drives. This meaning is unique and specific in that it must and can be fulfilled by him alone; only then does it achieve a significance which will satisfy his own will to meaning. There are some authors who contend that meanings and values are \\"nothing but defense mechanisms, reaction formations and sublimations.\\" But as for myself, I would not be willing to live merely for the sake of my \\"defense mechanisms,\\" nor would I be ready to die merely for the sake of my \\"reaction formations.\\" Man, however, is able to live and even die for the sake of his ideals and values!\u201d","when we saw a comrade smoking his own cigarettes, we knew he had given up faith in his strength to carry on, and, once lost, the will to live seldom returned.","Is this to say that suffering is indispensable to the discovery of meaning? In no way. I only insist that meaning is available in spite of\u2014nay, even through\u2014suffering, provided, as noted in Part Two of this book, that the suffering is unavoidable. If it is avoidable, the meaningful thing to do is to remove its cause, for unnecessary suffering is masochistic rather than heroic.

The same holds for human existence. One should not search for an abstract meaning of life. Everyone has his own specific vocation or mission in life to carry out a concrete assignment which demands fulfillment... the question of the meaning of life may actually be reversed.

I did not give up but retorted, \u201cIs it not conceivable, Rabbi, that precisely this was the meaning of your surviving your children: that you may be purified through these years of suffering, so that finally you, too, though not innocent like your children, may become worthy of joining them in Heaven?

Dissi poi che ognuno di noi doveva chiedersi che cosa avesse perduto, finora, d\u2019insostituibile. Feci delle riflessioni su questo punto, concludendo che la maggior parte di noi aveva perso ben poco d\u2019essenziale. Almeno chi era ancora in vita aveva buoni motivi per sperare. Salute, felicit\xe0 domestica, rendimento professionale, patrimonio, posizione sociale \u2013 erano tutte cose che si potevano sostituire, che si potevano ritrovare o rifare. \xabAbbiamo ancora le ossa intatte!\xbb. E nonostante tutto quello che ci avevano costretto a subire in quell\u2019ultimo periodo, il futuro, per noi, poteva ancora avere un senso. Citai Nietzsche: \xabCi\xf2 che non mi uccide, mi rende pi\xf9 forte\xbb. E poi parlai del futuro. Dissi che il futuro poteva apparire squallido agli occhi di un osservatore imparziale. Convenni che ognuno di noi poteva calcolare approssimativamente quanto poco probabile fosse uscire vivi dal Lager. Bench\xe9 non vi fosse ancora l\u2019epidemia di tifo petecchiale, valutavo al 5% la speranza di sopravvivenza, e lo dissi agli altri. Poi dissi anche che io, per quanto mi concerneva, non pensavo neppure lontanamente, nonostante tutto, a rinunciare alla speranza, ad abbandonare la lotta: perch\xe9 nessun uomo conosce il futuro, nessun uomo sa che cosa pu\xf2 portargli magari l\u2019ora successiva. E se non era lecito attendere per l\u2019indomani eventi militari sensazionali, chi meglio di noi \u2013 con la nostra esperienza del Lager \u2013 poteva sapere se non sarebbe sopravvenuta all\u2019improvviso una qualche prospettiva, almeno per qualcuno: un\u2019insospettata inclusione in un piccolo trasporto verso un campo di lavoro a condizioni particolarmente favorevoli, o qualcosa del genere. Cose che sono la grande aspirazione di un internato: la sua \u201cfelicit\xe0. Ma non parlai soltanto del futuro e del buio che fortunatamente lo circondava e del presente con tutte le sue sofferenze; parlai anche del passato, di tutte le sue gioie e della luce ch\u2019esso emanava, pur nell\u2019oscurit\xe0 dei nostri giorni. Citai di nuovo, per non diventare idillico in prima persona, il poeta che dice: \xabQuanto hai vissuto, nessuna potenza del mondo pu\xf2 togliertelo\xbb. Ci\xf2 che abbiamo realizzato nella pienezza della nostra vita passata, nella sua ricchezza d\u2019esperienza, questa ricchezza interiore, nessuno pu\xf2 sottrarcela. Ma non solo ci\xf2 che abbiamo vissuto, anche ci\xf2 che abbiamo fatto, ci\xf2 che di grande abbiamo pensato e ci\xf2 che abbiamo sofferto... Tutto ci\xf2 l\u2019abbiamo salvato rendendolo reale, una volta per sempre. E se pure si tratta di un passato, \xe8 assicurato per l\u2019eternit\xe0! Perch\xe9 essere passato \xe8 ancora un modo di essere, forse, anzi, il pi\xf9 sicuro. E parlai anche delle molte possibilit\xe0 di dare un significato alla vita. Raccontai ai miei compagni (che giacevano in silenzio, quasi senza muoversi, tutt\u2019al pi\xf9 lasciandosi sfuggire un sospiro commosso) che la vita umana ha sempre, in tutte le circostanze, un significato e che quest\u2019infinito senso dell\u2019essere comprende anche sofferenze, morte, miseria e malattie mortali.\u201d","En este punto quisiera hacer una observaci\xf3n.

What matters, therefore, is not the meaning of life in general but rather the specific meaning of a person\u2019s life at a given moment. To put the question in general terms would be comparable to the question posed to a chess champion: \u201cTell me, Master, what is the best move in the world? There simply is no such thing as the best or even a good move apart from a particular situation in a game and the particular personality of one\u2019s opponent. The same holds for human existence. One should not search for an abstract meaning of life. Everyone has his own specific vocation or mission in life to carry out a concrete assignment which demands fulfillment. Therein he cannot be replaced, nor can his life be repeated. Thus, everyone\u2019s task is as unique as is his specific opportunity to implement it. As each situation in life represents a challenge to man and presents a problem for him to solve, the question of the meaning of life may actually be reversed. Ultimately, man should not ask what the meaning of his life is, but rather he must recognize that it is he who is asked. In a word, each man is questioned by life; and he can only answer to life by answering for his own life; to life he can only respond by being responsible. Thus, logotherapy sees in responsibleness the very essence of human existence.\u201d","C\xe2t prive\u0219te cauzele concrete ale nevrozelor, dincolo de factori de natur\u0103 constitutiv\u0103, fie ei somatici sau psihici, mecanismele de r\u0103spuns \u0219i anxietatea anticipatorie par a juca un rol foarte important din punct de vedere patogenic.

However, logotherapy has developed a special technique to handle such cases, too.

It is characteristic of this fear that it produces precisely that of which the patient is afraid.

Happiness must happen, and the same holds for success: you have to let it happen by not caring about it.","there are three main avenues on which one arrives at meaning in life. The first is by creating a work or by doing a deed. The second is by experiencing something or encountering someone; in other words, meaning can be found not only in work but also in love.","not primarily a quest for pleasure, as Freud believed, or a quest for power, as Alfred Adler taught, but a quest for meaning. The greatest task for any person is to find meaning in his or her life.

Everything was sacrificed to this end. A man\'s character became involved to the point that he was caught in a mental turmoil which threatened all the values he held and threw them into doubt. Under the influence of a world which no longer recognized the value of human life and human dignity, which had robbed man of his will and had made him an object to be exterminated (having planned, however, to make full use of him first\u2014to the last ounce of his physical resources)\u2014under this influence the personal ego finally suffered a loss of values. If the man in the concentration camp did not struggle against this in a last effort to save his self-respect, he lost the feeling of being an individual, a being with a mind, with inner freedom and personal value. He thought of himself then as only a part of an enormous mass of people; his existence descended to the level of animal life.","I know that without the suffering, the growth that I have achieved would have been impossible. Is this to say that suffering is indispensable to the discovery of meaning? In no way. I only insist that meaning is available in spite of\u2014nay, even through\u2014suffering, provided, as noted in Part Two of this book, that the suffering is unavoidable. If it is avoidable, the meaningful thing to do is to remove its cause, for unnecessary suffering is masochistic rather than heroic.\u201d","The man who experiences his way of being merely as something totally provisional is no longer taking his life quite seriously. So he is at risk of a kind of life in which he does not actualize the possibilities that are offered to him, but rather he forfeits them: he lets them pass him by. He constantly waits for something, without doing his part to make it happen. He becomes fatalistic. Instead of acting from the consciousness of a responsibility, he has the point of view that he should let things go, laissez aller, and let other people do as they please-laissez faire. He changes from a human subject into a mere object-an object of circumstances, of current conditions, of the moment in history. But he overlooks the fact that in history nothing has already been done-rather, everything is to be done. He overlooks the extent to which current conditions depend on him, the fact that they are creatively shapeable; he forgets that he bears a share of the responsibility.","As a professor in two fields, neurology and psychiatry, I am fully aware of the extent to which man is subject to biological, psychological and sociological conditions.

But in these times of crisis, with their woes, a new time is already being born. It is precisely in such times that every individual is burdened with an unprecedented, heavy but glorious responsibility: it depends on every individual what comes forth out of this time. It depends on the statesmen, what becomes of the atom bomb, whether it is a curse or a blessing to humanity; and it depends on every single \\"little\\" man, the \\"man in the street,\\" what comes of his life and that of his family in the next few years and decades. Every stone that-literally and figuratively-is laid for today for the purposes of rebuilding, will need to lie there in future decades-and it depends on the way in which it is laid whether the next generation will be able to keep building on this foundation. That is the glorious responsibility of such a time, that we know how many difficulties we have to bear, and yet at the same time how many opportunities we hold in our hands! \\"He who as a why to live for can bear almost any how,\\" Nietzsche once said. The consciousness of our unprecedented responsibility, which encompasses the future of one\'s own life, or that of a family, of a work, of a larger society, or of a people, a state even, of humanity, this true \\"historical\\" consciousness of responsibility will allow the man of today to bear the \\"how\\" of his difficult life circumstances, to shape them, to surmount them. In our struggle full of duties and responsibility every single one of us is indeed called upon. Accordingly nobody has the right to wait \\"until things become clearer\\" and to continue to live only provisionally. As soon as we try to shape the provisional, it is no longer provisional! Whether it is the provisional in the big things or the small things-each one of us has to reshape our own \\"provisional\\" life into a definitive one. Nobody is allowed to wait any longer-each of us must pitch in-each of us must ask ourselves, as a wise man asked sixteen centuries ago: \\"If I do not do it-who else will do it?

Whereupon I react by reporting that in the first place I do not at all see in the bestseller status of my book an achievement and accomplishment on my part but rather an expression of the misery of our time: if hundreds of thousands of people reach out for a book whose very title promises to deal with the question of a meaning to life, it must be a question that burns under their fingernails.\u201d","plantea.

It is only thus that we evoke his will to meaning from its state of latency.

Everyone has his own specific vocation or mission in life to carry out a concrete assignment which demands fulfillment. Therein he cannot be replaced, nor can his life be repeated. Thus, everyone\'s task is as unique as is his specific opportunity to implement it.","Not every conflict is necessarily neurotic; some amount of conflict is normal and healthy. In a similar sense suffering is not always a pathological phenomenon; rather than being a symptom of neurosis, suffering may well be a human achievement, especially if the suffering grows out of existential frustration. I would strictly deny that one\'s search or a meaning to his existence, or even his doubt of it, in every case is derived from, or results in, any disease. Existential frustration is neither pathological or pathogenic. A man\'s concern, even his despair, over the worthwhileness of life is an existential distress but by no means a mental disease. it may well be that interpreting the first in terms of the latter motivates a doctor to bury his patient\'s existential despair under a heap of tranquilizing drugs. It is his task, rather, to pilot the patient through his existential crises of growth and development. Logotherapy regards its assignment as that of assisting the patient to find meaning in his life. Inasmuch as logotherapy makes him aware of the hidden logos of his existence, it is an analytical process. To this extent, logotherapy resembles psychoanalysis. However, in logotherapy\'s attempt to make something conscious again it does not restrict its activity to instinctual facts within the individual\'s unconscious bu also cares for existential realities, such as the potential meaning of his existence to be fulfilled as well as his will to meaning. Any analysis, however, even when it refrains from including the noological dimension in its therapeutic process, tries to make the patient aware of what he actually longs for in the depth of his being. Logotherapy deviates from psychoanalysis insofar as it considers man a being whose main concern consists in fulfilling a meaning, rather than in the mere gratification and satisfaction of drives and instincts, or in merely reconciling the conflict claims of id, ego and supergo, or in the mere adaptation and adjustment to society and environment.","From this one may see that there is no reason to pity old people. Instead, young people should envy them. It is true that the old have no opportunities, no possibilities in the future. But they have more than that. Instead of possibilities in the future, they have realities in the past\u2014the potentialities they have actualized, the meanings they have fulfilled, the values they have realized\u2014and nothing and nobody can ever remove these assets from the past.","Our generation is realistic, for we have come to know man as he really is.

Is it surprising that in those depths we again found only human qualities which in their very nature were a mixture of good and evil? The rift dividing good from evil, which goes through all human beings, reaches into the lowest depths and becomes apparent even on the bottom of the abyss which is laid open by the concentration camp.","In spite of all the enforced physical and mental primitiveness of the life in a concentration camp, it was possible for spiritual life to deepen. Sensitive people who were used to a rich intellectual life may have suffered much pain (they were often of a delicate constitution), but the damage to their inner selves was less. They were able to retreat from their terrible surroundings to a life of inner riches and spiritual freedom. Only in this way can one explain the apparent paradox that some prisoners of a less hardy make-up often seemed to survive camp life better than did those of a robust nature. In order to make myself clear, I am forced to fall back on personal experience.","Freedom is but the negative aspect of the whole phenomenon whose positive aspect is responsibleness.

Dostoevsky said once, \u201cThere is only one thing that I dread: not to be worthy of my sufferings.","A given symptom is responded to by a phobia, the phobia triggers the symptom, and the symptom, in turn, reinforces the phobia. A similar chain of events, however, can be observed in obsessive-compulsive cases in which the patient fights the ideas which haunt him. Thereby, however, he increases their power to disturb him, since pressure precipitates counter-pressure. Again the symptom is reinforced! On the other hand, as soon as the patient stops fighting his obsessions and instead tries to ridicule them by dealing with them in an ironical way-by applying paradoxical intention-the vicious circle is cut, the symptom diminishes and finally atrophies. In the fortunate case where there is no existential vacuum which invites and elicits the symptom, the patient will not only succeed in ridiculing his neurotic fear but finally will succeed in completely ignoring it.","proof that everything can be taken from a man but one thing: the last of the human freedoms\u2014to choose one\u2019s attitude in any given set of circumstances, to choose one\u2019s own way.","What matters, therefore, is not the meaning of life in general but rather the specific meaning of a person\u2019s life at a given moment.","In a position of utter desolation, when man cannot express himself in positive action, when his only achievement may consist in enduring his sufferings in the right way \u2014an honorable way\u2014in such a position man can, through loving contemplation of the image he carries of his beloved, achieve fulfillment.","S\u0103 revenim la chestiunea propriu-zis\u0103 a sensului.

Nietzsche\u2019s words, \u201cHe who has a why to live for can bear with almost any how, could be the guiding motto for all psychotherapeutic and psychohygienic efforts regarding prisoners.\u201d","there is something which seems to me to be an...erroneous and dangerous assumption, namely, that which I call \\"pan-determinism.\\" By that I mean the view of man which disregards his capacity to take a stand toward any conditions whatsoever. Man is not fully conditioned and determined but rather determines himself whether he gives in to conditions or stands up to them. In other words, man is ultimately self-determining. Man does not simply exist but always decides what his existence will be, what he will become in the next moment.By the same token, every human being has the freedom to change at nay instant. Therefore, we can predict his future only within the large framework of a statistical survey referring to a whole group; the individual personality, however, remains essentially unpredictable. The basis for any predictions would be represented by biological, psychological or sociological conditions. Yet one of the main features of human existence is the capacity to rise above such conditions, to grow beyond them. Man is capable of changing the world for the better if possible, and of changing himself for the better if necessary.","we can predict his future only within the large framework of a statistical survey referring to a whole group; the individual personality, however, remains essentially unpredictable","How paradoxical was our time-experience! In this connection we are reminded of Thomas Mann\u2019s The Magic Mountain, which contains some very pointed psychological remarks. Mann studies the spiritual development of people who are in an analogous psychological position, i.e., tuberculosis patients in a sanatorium who also know no date for their release. They experience a similar existence\u2014without a future and without a goal.","under this influence the personal ego finally suffered a loss of values. If the man in the concentration camp did not struggle against this in a last effort to save his self-respect, he lost the feeling of being an individual, a being with a mind, with inner freedom and personal value.

It emphasizes that there is an ultimate purpose to life. And in its original version, before an appendix was added, it concluded with one of the most religious sentences written in the twentieth Century:","Every age has its own collective neurosis, and every age needs its own psychotherapy to cope with it. The existential vacuum which is the mass neurosis of the present time can be described as a private and personal form of nihilism; for nihilism can be defined as the contention that being has no meaning.","if she were still alive. I knew only one thing\u2014which I have learned well by now: Love goes very far beyond the physical person of the beloved. It finds its deepest meaning in his spiritual being, his inner self.

That is why man is ever ready to suffer, on the condition, to be sure, that his suffering has a meaning.","Don\'t aim at success -- the more you aim at it and make it a target, the more you are going to miss it. For success, like happiness, cannot be pursued; it must ensue, and it only does so as the unintended side-effect of one\'s dedication to a cause greater than oneself or as the by-product of one\'s surrender to a person other than oneself.","National Socialism nurtured racism. In reality there are only two races, namely the \\"race\\" of decent people and the \\"race\\" of people who are not decent. And \\"segregation\\" runs straight through all nations and within every single nation straight through all parties. Even in the concentration camps one came across halfway decent fellows here and there among the SS men-just as one came across the odd scoundrel or two among the prisoners. not to mention the Capos. That decent people are in the minority, that they have always been a minority and are likely to remain so is something we must come to terms with. Danger only threatens when a political system sends those not-decent people, i.e., the negative element of a nation, to the top. And no nation is immune from doing this, and in this respect every nation is in principle capable of a Holocaust! In support of this we have the sensational results of scientific experiments in the field of social psychology, for which we owe thanks to an American; they are known as the Milgram Experiment. If we want to extract the political consequences from all this, we should assume that there are basically only two styles of politics, or perhaps better said, only two types of politicians: the first are those believe that the end justifies the means, and that could be any means...While the other type of politician knows very well that there are mans that could desecrate the holiest end. And it is this type of politician whom I trust, despite the clamor around the year 1988, and the demands of the day, not to mention of the anniversary, trust to hear the voice of reason and to ensure that all who are of goodwill, stretch out their hands to each other, across all the graves and across all divisions.","Dostoevski said once, \u201cThere is only one thing that I dread: not to be worthy of my sufferings. These words frequently came to my mind after I became acquainted with those martyrs whose behavior in camp, whose suffering and death, bore witness to the fact that the last inner freedom cannot be lost.\u201d","A man who let himself decline because he could not see any future goal found himself occupied with retrospective thoughts. In a different connection, we have already spoken of the tendency there was to look into the past, to help make the present, with all its horrors, less real. But in robbing the present of its reality there lay a certain danger. It became easy to overlook the opportunities to make something positive of camp life, opportunities which really did exist.","Once, an elderly general practitioner consulted me because of his severe depression. He could not overcome the loss of his wife who had died two years before and whom he had loved above all else. Now, how could I help him? What should I tell him? Well, I refrained from telling him anything but instead confronted him with the question, \u201cWhat would have happened, Doctor, if you had died first, and your wife would have had to survive you? \u201cOh,\u201d he said, \u201cfor her this would have been terrible; how she would have suffered!\u201d Whereupon I replied, \u201cYou see, Doctor, such a suffering has been spared her, and it was you who have spared her this suffering\u2014to be sure, at the price that now you have to survive and mourn her.\u201d He said no word but shook my hand and calmly left my office.

The fear of sleeplessness13 results in a hyper-intention to fall asleep, which, in turn, incapacitates the patient to do so. To overcome this particular fear, I usually advise the patient not to try to sleep but rather to try to do just the opposite, that is, to stay awake as long as possible. In other words, the hyper-intention to fall asleep, arising from the anticipatory anxiety of not being able to do so, must be replaced by the paradoxical intention not to fall asleep, which soon will be followed by sleep.","From all this we may learn that there are two races of men in this world, but only these two\u2014the \u201crace of the decent man and the \u201crace\u201d of the indecent man.

Such a value system might be responsible for the fact that the burden of unavoidable unhappiness is increased by unhappiness about being unhappy.4 And in another paper she expressed the hope that logotherapy \u201cmay help counteract certain unhealthy trends in the present-day culture of the United States, where the incurable sufferer is given very little opportunity to be proud of his suffering and to consider it ennobling rather than degrading\u201d so that \u201che is not only unhappy, but also ashamed of being unhappy.\u201d5\u201d","Happiness must happen, and the same holds for success: you have to let it happen by not caring about it.

When a man finds that it is his destiny to suffer, he will have to accept his suffering as his task; his single and unique task. He will have to acknowledge the fact that even in suffering he is unique and alone in the universe.","All psychotherapy is ultimately something of an art. There is always an irrational element in psychotherapy. The doctor\'s artistic intuition and sensitivity is of considerable importance. The patient, too, brings an irrational element into the relationship: his individuality.","But Frankl\u2019s concern is less with the question of why most died than it is with the question of why anyone at all survived.","[T]he transitoriness of our existence in no way makes it meaningless. But it does constitute our responsibleness; for everything hinges upon our realizing the essentially transitory possibilities. Man constantly makes his choice concerning the mass of present potentialities; which of these will be condemned to nonbeing and which will be actualized? Which choice will bemade an actuality once and forever, an immortal \\"footprint in the sands of time\\"?At any moment, man must decide, for better or for worse, what will be the monument of his existence.","But everything great is just as difficult to realize as it is rare to find","Danger only threatens when a political system sends those not-decent people, i.e., the negative element of a nation, to the top.

When the impossibility of replacing a person is realised, it allows the responsibility which a man has for his existence and its continuance to appear in all its magnitude. A man who becomes conscious of the responsibility which a man bears toward a human being who affectionately waits for him, or to an unfinished work, will never be able to throw away his life.

When the surgeon has completed an amputation, he takes off his rubber gloves and appears to have done his duty as a physician. But if the patient then commits suicide because he cannot bear living as a cripple - of what use has the surgical therapy been? Is it not also part of the physician\'s work to do something about the patient\'s attitude toward the pain of surgery or the handicap that results from it?","Tudo pode ser tirado de uma pessoa, exceto uma coisa: a liberdade de escolher sua atitude em qualquer circunst\xe2ncia da vida.","A man who let himself decline because he could not see any future goal found himself occupied with retrospective thoughts.","the drug scene is one aspect of a more general mass phenomenon, namely the feeling of meaninglessness resulting from a frustration of our existential needs which in turn has become a universal phenomenon in our industrial societies...the feeling of meaninglessness plays an ever increasing role in the etiology of neurosis.

But apart from theselection of Capos which was undertaken by the SS,there was a sort of self-selecting process going on thewhole time among all of the prisoners. On the average,only those prisoners could keep alive who, after yearsof trekking from camp to camp, had lost all scruples intheir fight for existence; they were prepared to useevery means, honest and otherwise, even brutal force,theft, and betrayal of their friends, in order to savethemselves.

For what then matters is to bear witness to the uniquely human potential at its best, which is to transform a personal tragedy into a triumph, to turn one\'s predicament into a human achievement. When we are no longer able to change a situation--just think of an incurable disease such as inoperable cancer--we are challenged to change ourselves.","The way in which a man accepts his fate and all the suffering it entails, the way in which he takes up his cross, gives him ample opportunity\u2014even under the most difficult circumstances\u2014to add a deeper meaning to his life.","(That which does not kill me, makes me stronger.)","As we said before, any attempt to restore a man\u2019s inner strength in the camp had first to succeed in showing him some future goal. Nietzsche\u2019s words, \u201cHe who has a why to live for can bear with almost any how, could be the guiding motto for all psychotherapeutic and psychohygienic efforts regarding prisoners. Whenever there was an opportunity for it, one had to give them a why\u2014an aim\u2014for their lives, in order to strengthen them to bear the terrible how of their existence. Woe to him who saw no more sense in his life, no aim, no purpose, and therefore no point in carrying on. He was soon lost. The typical reply with which such a man rejected all encouraging arguments was, \u201cI have nothing to expect from life any more.\u201d What sort of answer can one give to that? \u201cWhat was really needed was a fundamental change in our attitude toward life. We had to learn ourselves and, furthermore, we had to teach the despairing men, that it did not really matter what we expected from life, but rather what life expected from us. We needed to stop asking about the meaning of life, and instead to think of ourselves as those who were being questioned by life\u2014daily and hourly. Our answer must consist, not in talk and meditation, but in right action and in right conduct. Life ultimately means taking the responsibility to find the right answer to its problems and to fulfill the tasks which it constantly sets for each individual. These tasks, and therefore the meaning of life, differ from man to man, and from moment to moment. Thus it is impossible to define the meaning of life in a general way. Questions about the meaning of life can never be answered by sweeping statements. \u201cLife\u201d does not mean something vague, but something very real and concrete, just as life\u2019s tasks are also very real and concrete. They form man\u2019s destiny, which is different and unique for each individual. No man and no destiny can be compared with any other man or any other destiny. No situation repeats itself, and each situation calls for a different response. Sometimes the situation in which a man finds himself may require him to shape his own fate by action. At other times it is more advantageous for him to make use of an opportunity for contemplation and to realize assets in this way. Sometimes man may be required simply to accept fate, to bear his cross. Every situation is distinguished by its uniqueness, and there is always only one right answer to the problem posed by the situation at hand.\u201d","they did not take their life seriously and despised it as something of no consequence.

But although it is not caused by anything pathological, it may well cause a pathological reaction; in other words, it is potentially pathogenic. Just consider the mass neurotic syndrome so pervasive in the young generation: there is ample empirical evidence that the three facets of this syndrome-depression, aggression, addiction-are due to what is called in logotherapy \\"the existential vacuum,\\" a feeling of emptiness and meaninglessness. It goes without saying that not each and every case of depression is to be traced back to a feeling of meaninglessness, nor does suicide-in which depression sometimes eventuates-always result from an existential vacuum. But even if each and every case of suicide had not been undertaken out of a feeling of meaninglessness, it may well be that na individual\'s impulse to take his life would have been overcome had he been aware of some meaning and purpose worth living for. If, thus, a strong meaning orientation plays a decisive role in the prevention of suicide, what about intervention in cases in which there is a suicide risk?","Apathy, the blunting of the emotions and the feelingthat one could not care any more, were the symptomsarising during the second stage of the prisoner\'s psychologicalreactions, and which eventually made himinsensitive to daily and hourly beatings.

We had to learn ourselvesand, furthermore, we had to teach the despairing men,that it did not really matter what we expected from life,but rather what life expected from us. We needed tostop asking about the meaning of life, and instead tothink of ourselves as those who were being questionedby life - daily and hourly. Our answer must consist,not in talk and meditation, but in right action and inright conduct. Life ultimately means taking the responsibilityto find the right answer to its problems andto fulfill the tasks which it constantly sets for eachindividual.","greatest task for any person is to find meaning in his or her life.","Seorang manusia yang menyadari tanggung jawabnya terhadap manusia lain yang menunggunya dengan kasih sayang, atau tanggung jawabnya terhadap pekerjaan yang belum selesai, tidak akan pernah bisa mengabaikan hidupnya.

When we are no longer able to change a situation... we are challenged to change ourselves.","love is as strong as death."]')}}]);
