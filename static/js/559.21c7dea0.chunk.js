Then take the plunge and discard all the rest. By doing this, you can reset your life and embark on a new lifestyle.","The best way to choose what to keep and what to throw away is to take each item in one\u2019s hand and ask: \u2018Does this spark joy?\u2019 If it does, keep it. If not, dispose of it. This is not only the simplest but also the most accurate yardstick by which to judge.","Imagine what it would be like to have a bookshelf filled only with books that you really love. Isn\u2019t that image spellbinding? For someone who loves books, what greater happiness could there be?","No matter how wonderful things used to be, we cannot live in the past. The joy and excitement we feel here and now are more important.","People cannot change their habits without first changing their way of thinking.","Clutter is caused by a failure to return things to where they belong. Therefore, storage should reduce the effort needed to put things away, not the effort needed to get them out.","The true purpose of a present is to be received.","For books, timing is everything. The moment you first encounter a particular book is the right time to read it. To avoid missing that moment, I recommend that you keep your collection small.","When you come across something that you cannot part with, think carefully about its true purpose in your life. You\u2019ll be surprised at how many of the things you possess have already fulfilled their role. By acknowledging their contribution and letting them go with gratitude, you will be able to truly put the things you own, and your life, in order. In the end, all that will remain are the things that you really treasure. To truly cherish the things that are important to you, you must first discard those that have outlived their purpose.","Visible mess helps distract us from the true source of the disorder.","I have yet to see a house that lacked sufficient storage. The real problem is that we have far more than we need or want.","People with large book collections are almost always diligent learners.","There\u2019s no need to finish reading books that you only got halfway through. Their purpose was to be read halfway.","If sweatpants are your everyday attire, you\u2019ll end up looking like you belong in them, which is not very attractive. What you wear in the house does impact your self-image.","It is the same with people. Not every person you meet in life will become a close friend or lover. Some you will find hard to get along with or impossible to like. But these people, too, teach you the precious lesson of who you do like, so that you will appreciate those.","We should be choosing what we want to keep, not what we want to get rid of.","From the moment you start tidying, you will be compelled to reset your life. As a result, your life will start to change. That\u2019s why the task of putting your house in order should be done quickly. It allows you to confront the issues that are really important. Tidying is just a tool, not the final destination. The true goal should be to establish the lifestyle you want most once your house has been put in order.","I recommend you dispose of anything that does not fall into one of three categories: currently in use, needed for a limited period of time, or must be kept indefinitely.","Storage experts are hoarders.","Tidy a little a day and you\u2019ll be tidying forever.","To truly cherish the things that are important to you, you must first discard those that have outlived their purpose. To get rid of what you no longer need is neither wasteful nor shameful. Can you truthfully say that you treasure something buried so deeply in a closet or drawer that you have forgotten its existence? If things had feelings, they would certainly not be happy. Free them from the prison to which you have relegated them. Help them leave that deserted isle to which you have exiled them. Let them go, with gratitude. Not only you, but your things as well, will feel clear and refreshed when you are done tidying.","All you need to do is take the time to sit down and examine each item you own, decide whether you want to keep or discard it, and then choose where to put what you keep.","When we disperse storage of a particular item throughout the house and tidy one place at a time, we can never grasp the overall volume and therefore can never finish. To escape this negative spiral, tidy by category, not by place.","By starting with the easy things first and leaving the hardest for last, you can gradually hone your decision-making skills, so that by the end, it seems simple.","What was it that motivated you to tidy in the first place? What do you hope to gain through tidying? Before you start getting rid of things, take the time to think this through carefully. This means visualizing the ideal lifestyle you dream of.","The ultimate secret of success is this: If you tidy up in one shot, rather than little by little, you can dramatically change your mind-set.","Can you place your hand on your heart and swear that you are happy when surrounded by so much stuff that you don\u2019t even remember what\u2019s there?","When your room is clean and uncluttered, you have no choice but to examine your inner state.","Your real life begins after putting your house in order.","As for you, pour your time and passion into what brings you the most joy, your mission in life.","My filing method is extremely simple. I divide them into two categories: papers to be saved and papers that need to be dealt with. Although my policy is to get rid of all papers, these are the only categories I make for those that can\u2019t be discarded.","Letting go is even more important than adding.","When you attend a seminar, do so with the resolve to part with every handout distributed. If you regret recycling it, take the same seminar again, and this time apply the learning. It\u2019s paradoxical, but I believe that precisely because we hang on to such materials, we fail to put what we learn into practice.","I\u2019m sure most of us have been scolded for not tidying up our rooms, but how many of our parents consciously taught us how to tidy as part of our upbringing?","Never, ever tie up your stockings. Never, ever ball up your socks. I pointed to the balled-up socks. \u201cLook at them carefully. This should be a time for them to rest. Do you really think they can get any rest like that?","The lives of those who tidy thoroughly and completely, in a single shot, are without exception dramatically altered.","After all, our possessions very accurately relate the history of the decisions we have made in life.","Putting your house in order is the magic that creates a vibrant and happy life.","Reducing the amount of stuff in our space also reduces the amount of dust, and we actually clean more often.","It is not memories but the person we have become because of those past experiences that we should treasure.","Repetition and wasted effort can kill motivation, and therefore it must be avoided.","We amass material things for the same reason that we eat\u2014to satisfy a craving. Buying on impulse and eating and drinking to excess are attempts to alleviate stress.","Ah! This is just the amount I need to live comfortably. This is all I need to be happy. I don\u2019t need anything more.","The key is to store things standing up rather than laid flat. Some people mimic store displays, folding each piece of clothing into a large square and then arranging them one on top of the other in layers. This is great for temporary sales displays in stores, but not what we should be aiming for at home, where our relationship with these clothes is long term.","A person\u2019s awareness and perspective on his or her own lifestyle are far more important than any skill at sorting, storing, or whatever.","If you live with your family, first clearly define separate storage spaces for each family member.","Start with clothes, then move on to books, papers, komono (miscellany), and finally things with sentimental value.","The process of deciding what to keep and what to discard will go much more smoothly if you begin with items that are easier to make decisions about. As you gradually work toward the harder categories, you will be honing your decision-making skills. Clothes are the easiest because their rarity value is extremely low.","We may think that we have stored things to suit our behavior, but usually we have unconsciously adjusted our actions to match where things are stored.","If you are aiming for an uncluttered room, it is much more important to arrange your storage so that you can tell at a glance where everything is than to worry about the details of who does what, where, and when.","Sorting papers rule of thumb: Discard everything once.","There are three approaches we can take toward our possessions: face them now, face them sometime, or avoid them until the day we die.","There is no need to buy dividers or any other gadget. You can solve your storage problems with things you already have in the house. The most common item I use is an empty shoebox.","Boxes are surprisingly bulky. Discard or recycle the box your cell phone comes in as soon as you unpack it. You don\u2019t need the manual or the CD that comes with it either. You\u2019ll figure out the applications you need through using it.","Only by discarding it will you be able to test how passionate you are about that subject.","Warranties are only used once a year if at all. What point is there in carefully sorting and separating them when the odds that they will be needed are so low?","Don\u2019t you think it is unnatural for us to possess things that don\u2019t bring us joy or things that we don\u2019t really need?","Treat your socks and stockings with respect.","By acknowledging their contribution and letting them go with gratitude, you will be able to truly put the things you own, and your life, in order.","The urge to point out someone else\u2019s failure to tidy is usually a sign that you are neglecting to take care of your own space.","Have you ever had the experience where you thought what you were doing was a good thing but later learned that it had hurt someone? At the time, you were totally unconcerned, oblivious to the other person\u2019s feelings. This is somewhat similar to the way many of us treat our socks.","To truly cherish the things that are important to you, you must first discard those that have outlived their purpose. To throw away what you no longer need is neither wasteful nor shameful.","Tidying is just a tool, not the final destination. The true goal should be to establish the lifestyle you want most once your house has been put in order.","I recommend storing vertically anything that can be stood up.","It\u2019s a very strange phenomenon, but when we reduce what we own and essentially \u2018detox\u2019 our house, it has a detox effect on our bodies as well.","The essence of effective storage is this: designate a spot for every last thing you own.","If you can say without a doubt, \u2018I really like this!\u2019 no matter what anyone else says, and if you like yourself for having it, then ignore what other people think.","When people revert to clutter no matter how much they tidy, it is not their room or their belongings but their way of thinking that is at fault.","Although we can get to know ourselves better by sitting down and analyzing our characteristics or by listening to others\u2019 perspectives on us, I believe that tidying is the best way.","If you want the book so badly after getting rid of it that you\u2019re willing to buy another copy, then buy one\u2014and this time read and study it.","Getting rid of other people\u2019s things without permission demonstrates a sad lack of common sense.","Never discard anything without saying thank you and good-bye.","I begin my course with these words: Tidying is a special event. Don\u2019t do it every day.","Unlike work, studies, or sports, there is no need to compare your performance to that of anyone else.","I believe that tidying is a celebration, a special send-off for those things that will be departing from the house, and therefore I dress accordingly.","The more time it takes, the more tired you feel, and the more likely you are to give up when you\u2019re only halfway through.","Be sure to completely finish the first task before starting the next.","The work involved can be broadly divided into two kinds: deciding whether or not to dispose of something and deciding where to put it. If you can do these two things, you can achieve perfection.","When you\u2019ve finished putting your house in order, your life will change dramatically. Once you have experienced what it\u2019s like to have a truly ordered house, you\u2019ll feel your whole world brighten.","Human beings can only truly cherish a limited number of things at one time. As I am both lazy and forgetful, I can\u2019t take proper care of too many things.","Things stored out of sight are dormant. This makes it much harder to decide whether they inspire joy or not.","Tidying is the act of confronting yourself.","Tidying orders and relaxes the mind.","Follow your intuition and all will be well.","Tidying your physical space allows you to tend to your psychological space.","Cherish the things you love. Cherish yourself.","Your parents\u2019 home is not a haven for mementos.","Just because you dispose of something does not mean you give up past experiences or your identity.","The moment you first encounter a book is the right time to read it.","Being messy is not hereditary nor is it related to lack of time.","It is very natural for me to say thank you to the goods that support us.","What you don\u2019t need, your family doesn\u2019t either.","The best way to choose what to keep and what to throw away is to take each item in one\u2019s hand and ask: \u201cDoes this spark joy? If it does, keep it. If not, dispose of it. This is not only the simplest but also the most accurate yardstick by which to judge.\u201d","The process of assessing how you feel about the things you own, identifying those that have fulfilled their purpose, expressing your gratitude, and bidding them farewell, is really about examining your inner self, a rite of passage to a new life.","Therefore, the best criterion for choosing what to keep and what to discard is whether keeping it will make you happy, whether it will bring you joy.","Keep only those things that speak to your heart. Then take the plunge and discard all the rest.","Discarding is not the point; what matters is keeping those things that bring you joy. If you discard everything until you have nothing left but an empty house, I don\u2019t think you\u2019ll be happy living there. Our goal in tidying should be to create a living environment filled with the things we love.","The best way to find out what we really need is to get rid of what we don\'t.","Many people carry this type of negative self-image for years, but it is swept away the instant they experience their own perfectly clean space. This drastic change in self-perception, the belief that you can do anything if you set your mind to it, transforms behavior and lifestyles. This is precisely why my students never experience rebound. Once you have experienced the powerful impact of a perfectly ordered space, you, too, will never return to clutter.","Tidying is the act of confronting yourself; cleaning is the act of confronting nature","You could say that tidying orders the mind while cleaning purifies it.","Does this spark joy? If it does, keep it. If not, dispose of it.\u201d","The best sequence is this: clothes first, then books, papers, komono (miscellany), and lastly, mementos.","The act of folding is far more than making clothes compact for storage. It is an act of caring, an expression of love and appreciation for the way these clothes support your lifestyle. Therefore, when we fold, we should put our heart into it, thanking our clothes for protecting our bodies.","If you missed your chance to read a particular book, even if it was recommended to you or is one you have been intending to read for ages, this is your chance to let it go. You may have wanted to read it when you bought it, but if you haven\'t read it by now, the book\'s purpose was to teach you that you didn\'t need it. There is no need to finish reading books that you only got halfway through. Their purpose was to be read halfway. So get rid of all those unread books.

Isn\u2019t this the lifestyle you dream of?","Presents are not \u201cthings but a means for conveying someone\u2019s feelings.

At this stage, the one disaster that can wreak more havoc than an earthquake is the entrance of that recycling expert who goes by the alias of \\"mother.","Effective tidying involves only two essential actions: discarding and deciding where to store things. Of the two, discarding must come first.","I want to live my life in such a way that it colors my things with memories.","people who can\u2019t stay tidy can be categorized into just three types: the \u201ccan\u2019t-throw-it-away type, the \u201ccan\u2019t-put-it-back\u201d type, and the \u201cfirst-two-combined\u201d type.\u201d","We amass material things for the same reason that we eat - to satisfy a craving.

Just thank it for the joy it gave you when you first received it. Of course, it would be ideal if you could use it with joy. But surely the person who gave it to you doesn\u2019t want you to use it out of a sense of obligation, or to put it away without using it, only to feel guilty every time you see it.

When did you get it and what meaning did it have for you then? Reassess the role it plays in your life. If, for example, you have some clothes that you bought but never wear, examine them one at a time. Where did you buy that particular outfit and why? If you bought it because you thought it looked cool in the shop, it has fulfilled the function of giving you a thrill when you bought it. Then why did you never wear it?

When these things are hard to obtain or replace (rarity), they become even harder to part with.","Clutter has only two possible causes: too much effort is required to put things away or it is unclear where things belong.","Tidying in the end is just a physical act. The work involved can be broadly divided into two kinds: deciding whether or not to dispose of something and deciding where to put it. If you can do these two things, you can achieve perfection. Objects can be counted. All you need to do is look at each item, one at a time, and decide whether or not to keep it and where to put it. That\u2019s all you need to do to complete this job.

This approach is a fatal trap. Clutter is caused by a failure to return things to where they belong. Therefore, storage should reduce the effort needed to put things away, not the effort needed to get them out.","Storage, after all, is the magical act of finding a home for your belongings.","Books you have read have already been experienced and their content is inside you,","During the selection process, if you come across something that does not spark joy but that you just can\u2019t bring yourself to throw away, stop a moment and ask yourself, \u201cAm I having trouble getting rid of this because of an attachment to the past or because of a fear for the future? Ask this for every one of these items. As you do so, you\u2019ll begin to see a pattern in your ownership of things, a pattern that falls into one of three categories: attachment to the past, desire for stability in the future, or a combination of both. It\u2019s important to understand your ownership pattern because it is an expression of the values that guide your life.\u201d","Discard anything that doesn\u2019t spark joy.","The true purpose of tidying is, I believe, to live in the most natural state possible.

It is life transforming.","I pointed to the balled-up socks. \u201cLook at them carefully. This should be a time for them to rest. Do you really think they can get any rest like that? That\u2019s right. The socks and stockings stored in your drawer are essentially on holiday. They take a brutal beating in their daily work, trapped between your foot and your shoe, enduring pressure and friction to protect your precious feet. The time they spend in your drawer is their only chance to rest. But if they are folded over, balled up, or tied, they are always in a state of tension, their fabric stretched and their elastic pulled. They roll about and bump into each other every time the drawer is opened and closed. Any socks and stockings unfortunate enough to get pushed to the back of the drawer are often forgotten for so long that their elastic stretches beyond recovery.\u201d","The energy of book titles and the words inside them are very powerful. In Japan, we say that \u201cwords make our reality. The words we see and with which we come into contact tend to bring about events of the same nature. In that sense, you will become the person who matches the books you have kept.\u201d","When you tidy, you gain a little confidence. You start to believe in the future. Things begin to go more smoothly. The people you meet change. Unexpected things happen in a positive way. Change begins to accelerate. And you begin to really enjoy your life.","It is not the number of folds but rather the amount of pressure applied that causes wrinkling.","The most basic rule is to hang clothes in the same category side by side, dividing your closet into a jacket section, a suit section, and so on. Clothes, like people, can relax more freely when in the company of others who are very similar in type, and therefore organizing them by category helps them feel more comfortable and secure.","As for you, pour your time and passion into what brings you the most joy, your mission in life. I am convinced that putting your house in order will help you find the mission that speaks to your heart. Life truly begins after you have put your house in order.","The moment you first encounter a particular book is the right time to read it.","Life becomes far easier once you know that things will still work out even if you are lacking something.","You won\u2019t die if your house isn\u2019t tidy, and there are many people in the world who really don\u2019t care if they can\u2019t put their house in order. Such people, however, would never pick up this book. You, on the other hand, have been led by fate to read it, and that means you probably have a strong desire to change your current situation, to reset your life, to improve your lifestyle, to gain happiness, to shine.","One of the reasons clutter eats away at us is because we have to search for something just to find out whether it\u2019s even there, and many times, no matter how much we search, we cannot seem to find what we are looking for. When we have reduced the amount we own and store our documents all in the same place, we can tell at a glance whether we have it or not. If it\u2019s gone, we can shift gears immediately and start thinking about what to do.","At their core, the things we really like do not change over time. Putting your house in order is a great way to discover what they are.","The real tragedy is to live your entire life without anything that brings you joy and never even realize it. From","This is why tidying must start with discarding. We need to exercise self-control and resist storing our belongings until we have finished identifying what we really want and need to keep.","Once you have an image of what the inside of your drawers will look like, you can begin folding. The goal is to fold each piece of clothing into a simple, smooth rectangle. First, fold each lengthwise side of the garment toward the center (such as the left-hand, then right-hand, sides of a shirt) and tuck the sleeves in to make a long rectangular shape. It doesn\u2019t matter how you fold the sleeves. Next, pick up one short end of the rectangle and fold it toward the other short end. Then fold again, in the same manner, in halves or in thirds. The number of folds should be adjusted so that the folded clothing when standing on edge fits the height of the drawer. This is the basic principle that will ultimately allow your clothes to be stacked on edge, side by side, so that when you pull open your drawer you can see the edge of every item inside. If you find that the end result is the right shape but too loose and floppy to stand up, it\u2019s a sign that your way of folding doesn\u2019t match the type of clothing.","A joy-filled home is like your own personal art museum","When you stand in front of a closet that has been reorganized so that the clothes rise to the right, you will feel your heart beat faster and the cells in your body buzz with energy. This energy will also be transmitted to your clothes. Even when you close the closet door, your room will feel fresher. Once you have experienced this, you\u2019ll never lose the habit of organizing by category. Some may question whether paying attention to such details can possibly cause such a change, but why waste your time doubting if incorporating this exciting magic into all your storage spaces could keep your room tidy?","To get rid of what you no longer need is neither wasteful nor shameful. Can you truthfully say that you treasure something buried so deeply in a closet or drawer that you have forgotten its existence?","Once you have experienced what it\u2019s like to have a truly ordered house, you\u2019ll feel your whole world brighten.","As I am both lazy and forgetful, I can\u2019t take proper care of too many things.","My clients always sound so happy, and the results show that tidying has changed their way of thinking and their approach to life. In fact, it has changed their future. Why? This question is addressed in more detail throughout the book, but basically, when you put your house in order, you put your affairs and your past in order, too.","Keep things because you love them- not \\"just because","The things we own are real. They exist here and now as a result of choices made in the past by no one other than ourselves. It is dangerous to ignore them or to discard them indiscriminately as if denying the choices we made. This is why I am against both letting things pile up and dumping things indiscriminately. It is only when we face the things we own one by one and experience the emotions they evoke that we can truly appreciate our relationship with them.","it is essential to create a quiet space in which to evaluate the things in your life.","What is the perfect amount of possessions? I think that most people don\u2019t know. If you have lived in Japan or the United States all your life, you have almost certainly been surrounded by far more than you need. This makes it hard for many people to imagine how much they need to live comfortably. As you reduce your belongings through the process of tidying, you will come to a point where you suddenly know how much is just right for you. You will feel it as clearly as if something has clicked inside your head and said, \u201cAh! This is just the amount I need to live comfortably. This is all I need to be happy. I don\u2019t need anything more. The satisfaction that envelops your whole being at that point is palpable. I call this the \u201cjust-right click point.\u201d Interestingly, once you have passed this point, you\u2019ll find that the amount you own never increases. And that is precisely why you will never rebound.\u201d","Clutter is caused by a failure to return things to where they belong. Therefore, storage should reduce the effort needed to put things away, not the effort needed to get them out. When we use something, we have a clear purpose for getting it out. Unless for some reason it is incredibly hard work, we usually don\u2019t mind the effort involved. Clutter has only two possible causes: too much effort is required to put things away or it is unclear where things belong.","If you tidy up in one shot, rather than little by little, you can dramatically change your mind-set. A change so profound that it touches your emotions will irresistibly affect your way of thinking and your lifestyle habits.","In cases like this, I recommend that my clients make a personal altar in a corner of their house. Although I use the word \u201caltar, there is no need to worry about the direction it faces or the design. Just make a corner that is shrine-like. I recommend the top shelf in a bookcase because locating it above eye level makes it more shrine-like. One theme underlying my method of tidying is transforming the home into a sacred space, a power spot filled with pure energy. A comfortable environment, a space that feels good to be in, a place where you can relax\u2014these are the traits that make a home a power spot. Would you rather live in a home like this or in one that resembles a storage shed? The answer, I hope, is obvious.\u201d","The moment you first encounter a particular book is the right time to read it. To avoid missing that moment, I recommend that you keep your collection small.","We live in this moment. Who you are now is more important than memories of your past. Be good to yourself.It is so hard to let go of things that once brought us joy and are filled with precious memories. It feels like we are losing the memories along with them. But that is not the case. Memories that are truly precious will never be forgotten, even if we discard an item associated with them. What really matters is not the past but the person we have now become, thanks to those past experiences. We should use our space not for the person we once were, but for our future selves.","My criterion for deciding to keep an item is that we should feel a thrill of joy when we touch it.","Success is 90 percent dependent on our mind-set.","But when we\'re caught up in the past and fear for the future, being unable to discard means that we can\'t see, what we need, what will satisfy us, or what we\'re really seeking.","Taking good care of your things leads to taking good care of yourself.","When a woman who is very anxious about the future chooses a partner, for example, she is less likely to select someone purely because she likes and enjoys being with him. She might choose someone she doesn\u2019t really like simply because the relationship seems advantageous to her or because she is afraid that if she doesn\u2019t choose him, she may not find anyone else.","Let\u2019s imagine a cluttered room. It does not get messy all by itself. You, the person who lives in it, makes the mess. There is a saying that \u201ca messy room equals a messy mind. I look at it this way. When a room becomes cluttered, the cause is more than just physical. Visible mess helps distract us from the true source of the disorder. The act of cluttering is really an instinctive reflex that draws our attention away from the heart of an issue. If you can\u2019t feel relaxed in a clean and tidy room, try confronting your feeling of anxiety. It may shed light on what is really bothering you. When your room is clean and uncluttered, you have no choice but to examine your inner state. You can see any issues you have been avoiding and are forced to deal with them. From the moment you start tidying, you will be compelled to reset your life. As a result, your life will start to change. That\u2019s why the task of putting your house in order should be done quickly. It allows you to confront the issues that are really important. Tidying is just a tool, not the final destination. The true goal should be to establish the lifestyle you want most once your house has been put in order. Storage\u201d","if you want to meet a beautiful home that is just right for you, take good care of the one you live in now.","When you\u2019ve finished tidying your books, step back and take a good look at your bookshelves. What kinds of words leap out at you from the titles on their spines? If you have been telling everyone you\u2019d like to get married sometime this year, but you have a lot of titles with words like \u201cXXX for Singles, or if you want to live a joyful life but own a lot of novels with tragic titles, watch out. The energy of book titles and the words inside them are very powerful. In Japan, we say that \u201cwords make our reality.\u201d The words we see and with which we come into contact tend to bring about events of the same nature. In that sense, you will become the person who matches the books you have kept.\u201d","A simple design that puts you at ease, a high degree of functionality that makes life simpler, a sense of rightness, or the recognition that a possession is useful in our daily lives\u2014these, too, indicate joy.","Having spent most of my life looking at things of every description, including those in my clients\u2019 homes, I have discovered three common elements involved in attraction: the actual beauty of the object itself (innate attraction), the amount of love that has been poured into it (acquired attraction), and the amount of history or significance it has accrued (experiential value).","What you wear in the house does impact your self-image.","Instead of suffering from the stress of looking and not finding, we take action, and these actions often lead to unexpected benefits... Life becomes far easier once you know that things will still work out even if you are lacking something.","It is only when you put your house in order that your furniture and decorations come to life.","Through this experience, I came to the conclusion that the best way to choose what to keep and what to throw away is to take each item in one\u2019s hand and ask: \u201cDoes this spark joy? If it does, keep it. If not, dispose of it. This is not only the simplest but also the most accurate yardstick by which to judge.\u201d","For books, timing is everything. The moment you first encounter a particular book is the right time to read it.","The meaning of a photo lies in the excitement and joy you feel when taking it.","In Japan, people believe that things like cleaning your room and keeping your bathroom spick-and-span bring good luck, but if your house is cluttered, the effect of polishing the toilet bowl is going to be limited.","In fact, I don\u2019t even own a dish rack. I put all the dishes I wash into a large bowl or colander and place this on the veranda to dry.","it seems to me that people have far more unread books than they once did, ranging from three to more than forty.","The question of what you want to own is actually the question of how you want to live your life. Attachment to the past and fears concerning the future not only govern the way you select the things you own but also represent the criteria by which you make choices in every aspect of your life, including your relationships with people and your job.","These include coats, suits, jackets, skirts, and dresses. My standard is this: hang any clothes that look like they would be happier hung up, such as those made with soft materials that flutter in the breeze or highly tailored cuts, which protest at being folded. These we should hang willingly.","One of my clients, a self-professed \\"dress fanatic\\" and successful businesswoman who has a whole closetful of them, calls the dress her \\"combat uniform.","The space in which we live should be for the person we are becoming now.

What","lies. The ultimate secret of success is this: If you tidy up in one shot, rather than little by little, you can dramatically change your mind-set.","During the selection process, if you come across something that does not spark joy but that you just can\u2019t bring yourself to throw away, stop a moment and ask yourself, \u201cAm I having trouble getting rid of this because of an attachment to the past or because of a fear for the future? Ask this for every one of these items. As you do so, you\u2019ll begin to see a pattern in your ownership of things, a pattern that falls into one of three categories: attachment to the past, desire for stability in the future, or a combination of both. It\u2019s important to understand your ownership pattern because it is an expression of the values that guide your life. The question of what you want to own is actually the question of how you want to live your life.\u201d","It\u2019s the information they contain that has meaning. There is no meaning in their just being on your shelves. You read books for the experience of reading.","In Japan, we say that \'words make our reality\'.","Rather, I found through this experience that there is significant similarity between meditating under a waterfall and tidying. When you stand under a waterfall, the only audible sound is the roar of water. As the cascade pummels your body, the sensation of pain soon disappears and numbness spreads. Then a sensation of heat warms you from the inside out, and you enter a meditative trance. Although I had never tried this form of meditation before, the sensation it generated seemed extremely familiar. It closely resembled what I experience when I am tidying. While not exactly a meditative state, there are times when I am cleaning that I can quietly commune with myself. The work of carefully considering each object I own to see whether it sparks joy inside me is like conversing with myself through the medium of my possessions. For this reason, it is essential to create a quiet space in which to evaluate the things in your life. Ideally, you should not even be listening to music. Sometimes I hear of methods that recommend tidying in time to a catchy song, but personally, I don\u2019t encourage this. I feel that noise makes it harder to hear the internal dialogue between the owner and his or her belongings. Listening to the TV is, of course, out of the question. If you need some background noise to relax, choose environmental or ambient music with no lyrics or well-defined melodies. If you want to add momentum to your tidying work, tap the power of the atmosphere in your room rather than relying on music. The best time to start is early morning. The fresh morning air keeps your mind clear and your power of discernment sharp. For this reason, most of my lessons commence in the morning. The earliest lesson I ever conducted began at six thirty, and we were able to clean at twice the usual speed. The clear, refreshed feeling gained after standing under a waterfall can be addictive. Similarly, when you finish putting your space in order, you will be overcome with the urge to do it again. And, unlike waterfall meditation, you don\u2019t have to travel long distances over hard terrain to get there. You can enjoy the same effect in your own home. That\u2019s pretty special, don\u2019t you think?","letting go is even more important than adding.","A short time after tidying, their space is a disorganized mess. The cause is not lack of skills but rather lack of awareness and the inability to make tidying a regular habit.","No matter how messy your house may be, tidying deals with physical objects. No matter how much stuff you may own, the amount is always finite.","Once you have piled your books, take them in your hand one by one and decide whether you want to keep or discard each one. The criterion is, of course, whether or not it gives you a thrill of pleasure when you touch it. Remember, I said when you touch it. Make sure you don\u2019t start reading it. Reading clouds your judgment. Instead of asking yourself what you feel, you\u2019ll start asking whether you need that book or not. Imagine what it would be like to have a bookshelf filled only with books that you really love. Isn\u2019t that image spellbinding? For someone who loves books, what greater happiness could there be?","A seminar\u2019s value begins the moment we start attending, and the key to extracting the full value is putting what we learn there into practice the moment the course ends.","Selecting and discarding one\u2019s possessions is a continuous process of making decisions based on one\u2019s own values.","If you just can\u2019t bring yourself to discard something, then keep it without any guilt.","Mi resi conto che il valore degli oggetti di cui ho goduto da sola \xe8 decisamente minore del valore degli oggetti che mi ricordano i bei momenti trascorsi insieme agli altri.","When you come across something that you cannot part with, think carefully about its true purpose in your life. You\u2019ll be surprised at how many of the things you possess have already fulfilled their role.","Previously, I had no confidence. I kept thinking that I needed to change, that I should be different, but now I can believe that I am okay just the way I am.","There is a saying that \u201ca messy room equals a messy mind.","In addition to the physical value of things, there are three other factors that add value to our belongings: function, information, and emotional attachment.","Not every person you meet in life will become a close friend or lover. Some you will find hard to get along with or impossible to like. But these people, too, teach you the precious lesson of who you do like, so that you will appreciate those special people even more.","Putting things away creates the illusion that the clutter problem has been solved. But sooner or later, all the storage units are full, the room once again overflows with things, and some new and \u201ceasy storage method becomes necessary, creating a negative spiral. This is why tidying must start with discarding. We need to exercise self-control and resist storing our belongings until we have finished identifying what we really want and need to keep.\u201d","Tidying is a special event. Don\u2019t do it every day.","Truly precious memories will never vanish even if you discard the objects associated with them. When you think about your future, is it worth keeping mementos of things that you would otherwise forget? We live in the present. No matter how wonderful things used to be, we cannot live in the past. The joy and excitement we feel here and now are more important.","Once you learn to choose your belongings properly, you will be left only with the amount that fits perfectly in the space you currently own.","Books are essentially paper\u2014sheets of paper printed with letters and bound together. Their true purpose is to be read, to convey the information to their readers. It\u2019s the information they contain that has meaning. There is no meaning in their just being on your shelves. You read books for the experience of reading. Books you have read have already been experienced and their content is inside you, even if you don\u2019t remember.","If you haven\u2019t done what you intended to do yet, donate or recycle that book. Only by discarding it will you be able to test how passionate you are about that subject. If your feelings don\u2019t change after discarding it, then you\u2019re fine as is. If you want the book so badly after getting rid of it that you\u2019re willing to buy another copy, then buy one\u2014and this time read and study it. Books","Effective tidying involves only two essential actions: discarding and deciding where to store things. Of the two, discarding must come first. This principle does not change. The rest depends on the level of tidiness you personally want to achieve.","Imagine your ideal lifestyle","The same goes for pajamas. If you are a woman, try wearing something elegant as nightwear. The worst thing you can do is to wear a sloppy sweat suit. I occasionally meet people who dress like this all the time, whether waking or sleeping. If sweatpants are your everyday attire, you\u2019ll end up looking like you belong in them, which is not very attractive. What you wear in the house does impact your self-image.","But that is not the only effect of folding. The real benefit is that you must handle each piece of clothing. As you run your hands over the cloth, you pour your energy into it. The Japanese word for healing is te-ate, which literally means \u201cto apply hands. The term originated prior to the development of modern medicine when people believed that placing one\u2019s hand on an injury promoted healing. We know that gentle physical contact from a parent, such as holding hands, patting a child on the head, and hugging, has a calming effect on children.\u201d","By putting our house in order, we can live in our natural state. We choose those things that bring us joy and cherish what is truly precious in our lives. Nothing can bring greater happiness than to be able to do something as simple and natural as this.","KonMari Method I describe in this book is not a mere set of rules on how to sort, organize, and put things away. It is a guide to acquiring the right mind-set for creating order and becoming a tidy person.","Are you happy wearing clothes that don\'t give you pleasure? Do you feel joy when surrounded by piles of unread books that don\'t touch your heart? Do you think that owning accessories you know you\'ll never use will ever bring you happiness?The answer to these questions should be no.Now imagine yourself living in a space that contains only things that spark joy.

Lay the toes one on top of the other and fold the stocking in half lengthwise. Then fold it into thirds, making sure that the toes are inside, not outside, and that the waistband protrudes slightly at the top. Finally, roll the stocking up toward the waistband. If the waistband is on the outside when you finish, you\u2019ve done it right. Fold knee-high stockings the same way. With thicker material, such as tights, it is easier to roll if you fold them in half rather than in thirds. The point is that the stocking should be firm and stable when you\u2019ve finished, much like a sushi roll. When you store the stockings in your drawer, arrange them on end so that the swirl is visible.","a messy environment taxes the brain. When surrounded by clutter, our brains are so busy registering all the things around us that we can\u2019t focus on what we should be doing in the moment, such as tackling the work on our desk or communicating with others. We feel distracted, stressed, and anxious, and our decision-making ability is impaired.","By handling each sentimental item and deciding what to discard, you process your past. If you just stow these things away in a drawer or cardboard box, before you realize it, your past will become a weight that holds you back and keeps you from living in the here and now.

To avoid this, I recommend tidying by category.

Precisely because no one is there to see you, it makes far more sense to reinforce a positive self-image by wearing clothes you love. The same goes for pajamas. If you are a woman, try wearing something elegant as nightwear. The worst thing you can do is to wear a sloppy sweat suit.","Being surrounded by things that spark joy makes you happy","One theme underlying my method of tidying is transforming the home into a sacred space, a power spot filled with pure energy.

Only you can know what kind of environment makes you feel happy. The act of picking up and choosing objects is extremely personal.

The\u201d","The things we own are real. They exist here and now as a result of choices made in the past by no one other than ourselves. It is dangerous to ignore them or to discard them indiscriminately as if denying the choices we made. This is why I am against both letting things pile up and dumping things indiscriminately. It is only when we face the things we own one by one and experience the emotions they evoke that we can truly appreciate our relationship with them","Keep only those things that speak to your heart.

If you\u2019ve tied them up, start by undoing the knot! Lay the toes one on top of the other and fold the stocking in half lengthwise. Then fold it into thirds, making sure that the toes are inside, not outside, and that the waistband protrudes slightly at the top. Finally, roll the stocking up toward the waistband. If the waistband is on the outside when you finish, you\u2019ve done it right. Fold knee-high stockings the same way. With thicker material, such as tights, it is easier to roll if you fold them in half rather than in thirds. The point is that the stocking should be firm and stable when you\u2019ve finished, much like a sushi roll. When you store the stockings in your drawer, arrange them on end so that the swirl is visible. If you are storing them in plastic drawers, I recommend putting them into a cardboard box first, so that they don\u2019t slip and unroll, and putting the box into the drawer. A shoebox is the perfect size for a stocking divider.","Kitchen gadgets are similar to children\u2019s toys.

If you\u2019ve folded back the tops, start by unfolding them. Place one sock on top of the other and follow the same principles as those for folding clothing. For low-cut socks that just cover the feet, folding twice is enough; for ankle socks, three times; for knee socks and over-knee socks, four to six times. You can adjust the number of folds to achieve the height that best suits the drawer. It\u2019s easy. Just aim to make a simple rectangle, the key to folding.

This excess is caused by our ignorance of how much we actually own.

Data show that the search for lost things adds up to an average of one workweek per year per employee. In a span of four years, that comes to a whole month. In the United States alone, this loss in productivity when converted to cash amounts to an estimated US$89 billion annually. This is more than double the combined profit of the world\u2019s five largest corporations. These figures are staggering, but this is the reality. The effects of clutter can be devastating. Still, there\u2019s no need to worry. All these problems can be solved by tidying up.","Once you have an image of what the inside of your drawers will look like, you can begin folding. The goal is to fold each piece of clothing into a simple, smooth rectangle. First, fold each lengthwise side of the garment toward the center (such as the left-hand, then right-hand, sides of a shirt) and tuck the sleeves in to make a long rectangular shape. It doesn\u2019t matter how you fold the sleeves. Next, pick up one short end of the rectangle and fold it toward the other short end. Then fold again, in the same manner, in halves or in thirds. The number of folds should be adjusted so that the folded clothing when standing on edge fits the height of the drawer. This is the basic principle that will ultimately allow your clothes to be stacked on edge, side by side, so that when you pull open your drawer you can see the edge of every item inside. If you find that the end result is the right shape but too loose and floppy to stand up, it\u2019s a sign that your way of folding doesn\u2019t match the type of clothing. Every piece of clothing has its own \u201csweet spot where it feels just right\u2014a folded state that best suits that item. This will differ depending on the type of material and size of the clothing, and therefore you will need to adjust your method until you find what works. This isn\u2019t difficult. By adjusting the height when folded so that it stands properly, you\u2019ll reach the sweet spot surprisingly easily.\u201d","When I put my house in order, I discovered what I really wanted to do.

In the same way, things that are loved by their owner and treated with care are vibrant and radiate an aura of wanting to be of more service to their owner. Things that are cherished shine.","Folding goes even more smoothly if you fold thin, soft material more tightly, reducing it to a small width and height, and thick, fluffy materials less.

I want to help others who feel the way I once did, who lack self-confidence and find it hard to open their hearts to others, to see how much support they receive from the space they live in and the things that surround them. This is why I spend my time visiting people\u2019s homes and instructing them in how to tidy.

They take a brutal beating in their daily work, trapped between your foot and your shoe, enduring pressure and friction to protect your precious feet. The time they spend in your drawer is their only chance to rest. But if they are folded over, balled up or tied, they are always in a state of tension, their fabric stretched and their elastic pulled. They roll about and bump into each other every time the drawer is opened and closed. Any socks and tights unfortunate enough to get pushed to the back of the drawer are often forgotten for so long that their elastic stretches beyond recovery. When the owner finally discovers them and puts them on, it will be too late and they will be relegated to the rubbish. What treatment could be worse than this? Let\u2019s begin with how to fold your tights. If you\u2019ve tied them up, start by undoing the knot! Lay the toes one on top of the other and fold the tights in half lengthwise.

If you\u2019re trying to feel good\u2014at least in the short term\u2014checking off an urgent task makes sense.

Can you place your hand on your heart and swear that you are happy when surrounded by so much stuff that you don\u2019t even remember what\u2019s there?

Unfortunately, the majority of them fail to embrace this as a \u201cspecial event\u201d and instead make do with rooms that are more like storage sheds. Decades drag by as they struggle unsuccessfully to maintain order by tidying every day. Believe me. Until you have completed the once-in-a-lifetime event of putting your house in order, any attempt to tidy on a daily basis is doomed to failure. Conversely, once you have put your house in order, tidying will be reduced to the very simple task of putting things back where they belong. In fact, this becomes an unconscious habit. I use the term \u201cspecial event\u201d because it is crucial to tackle this job within a short space of time while your spirits are uplifted.

While it may help you feel refreshed temporarily, the relief won\u2019t last because you haven\u2019t addressed the true cause of your anxiety.

You, the person who lives in it, makes the mess. There is a saying that \u201ca messy room equals a messy mind.\u201d I look at it this way. When a room becomes cluttered, the cause is more than just physical. Visible mess helps distract us from the true source of the disorder. The act of cluttering is really an instinctive reflex that draws our attention away from the heart of an issue. If you can\u2019t feel relaxed in a clean and tidy room, try confronting your feeling of anxiety. It may shed light on what is really bothering you. When your room is clean and uncluttered, you have no choice but to examine your inner state. You can see any issues you have been avoiding and are forced to deal with them.

Your desktop is a work surface, not a storage cupboard, so the rule of thumb is to store nothing on it. Pick a spot in your drawers and on your shelves for each item or category. As much as possible, the only things on your desk should be whatever you need right now for the project you are working on. Keep this image of a clear desktop in your mind when you start storing. People who do so usually finish with only a laptop and an ornament or potted plant on their desk. Designate a storage space even for things you use daily, such as a pen or memo pad. My clients are often surprised to find that it\u2019s not inconvenient at all to store these things out of sight when not in use.

I\u2019m ashamed to admit that it took me three years to see this. Many people are surprised to hear that such a seemingly viable approach is actually a common pitfall. The root of the problem lies in the fact that people often store the same type of item in more than one place. When we tidy each place separately, we fail to see that we\u2019re repeating the same work in many locations and become locked into a vicious circle of tidying. To avoid this, I recommend tidying by category. For example, instead of deciding that today you\u2019ll tidy a particular room, set goals like \u201cclothes today, books tomorrow. One reason so many of us never succeed at tidying is because we have too much stuff. This excess is caused by our ignorance of how much we actually own. When we disperse storage of a particular item throughout the house and tidy one place at a time, we can never grasp the overall volume and therefore can never finish.

But if you consider the rent you pay, turning your space into a storage shed for empty boxes, that probably costs you more than you would earn selling an appliance in a box.","Despite the fact that coins are perfectly good cash, they are treated with far less respect than paper money.","Not every person you meet in life will become a close friend or lover.","You\u2019ll be surprised at how many of the things you possess have already fulfilled their role. By acknowledging their contribution and letting them go with gratitude, you will be able to truly put the things you own, and your life, in order.","In fact, to go through life without knowing how to fold is a huge loss.","Through this experience, I came to the conclusion that the best way to choose what to keep and what to throw away is to take each item in one\u2019s hand and ask: \u201cDoes this spark joy? If it does, keep it. If not, dispose of it.\u201d","To face the things we own through tidying is to confront our past. There will be times when we regret our purchases or feel embarrassed by our decisions. But to face these feelings honestly and let things go with gratitude for teaching us what we really need is to acknowledge our past choices. By constantly repeating the mental process of identifying what we truly want and deciding what to do on the basis of what brings us joy, we acquire a positive perspective that affirms every choice we make.","Selection criterion: does it spark joy?","For the first category, clothing, I recommend dividing further into the following subcategories to increase efficiency: Tops (shirts, sweaters, etc.) Bottoms (pants, skirts, etc.) Clothes that should be hung (jackets, coats, suits, etc.) Socks Underwear Bags (handbags, messenger bags, etc.) Accessories (scarves, belts, hats, etc.) Clothes for specific events (swimsuits, kimonos, uniforms, etc.) Shoes And, yes, I include handbags and shoes as clothing.","In my work, the volume discarded by younger sisters is always greater than the volume discarded by older sisters, a phenomenon surely related to the fact that younger children are often accustomed to wearing hand-me-downs. There are two reasons why younger sisters tend to collect clothes they don\u2019t really like. One is that it\u2019s hard to get rid of something received from family. The other is that they don\u2019t really know what they like, which makes it hard to decide whether they should part with it. Because they receive so much clothing from others, they don\u2019t really need to shop and therefore they have less opportunity","Make sure you have gathered every last piece of clothing.","When choosing what to keep and what to let go, refer to the criteria introduced here: things that directly spark joy, those that provide functional joy, and those that lead to future joy.","You can forget about any clothes you find after this. They\u2019ll automatically go in the discard pile.","The first step is to check every closet and dresser in the house and gather all your clothes in one spot. Don\u2019t leave a single wardrobe or dresser drawer unopened.","When you come across something that\u2019s hard to discard, consider carefully why you have that specific item in the first place. When did you get it and what meaning did it have for you then? Reassess the role it plays in your life. If, for example, you have some clothes that you bought but never wear, examine them one at a time. Where did you buy that particular outfit and why? If you bought it because you thought it looked cool in the shop, it has fulfilled the function of giving you a thrill when you bought it. Then why did you never wear it? Was it because you realized that it didn\u2019t suit you when you tried it on at home? If so, and if you no longer buy clothes of the same style or color, it has fulfilled another important function\u2014it has taught you what doesn\u2019t suit you. In fact, that particular article of clothing has already completed its role in your life, and you are free to say, \u201cThank you for giving me joy when I bought you, or \u201cThank you for teaching me what doesn\u2019t suit me,\u201d and let it go. Every object has a different role to play. Not all clothes have come to you to be worn threadbare. It is the same with people. Not every person you meet in life will become a close friend or lover. Some you will find hard to get along with or impossible to like. But these people, too, teach you the precious lesson of who you do like, so that you will appreciate those special people even more.\u201d","it doesn\u2019t seem right to keep clothes we don\u2019t enjoy for relaxing around the house.","The proper order is to place clothes that are lighter in color at the front of the drawer and gradually progress to darker colors at the back. I don\u2019t know whether or not this increases good fortune, but when clothes are arranged in a gradation of color, it feels great to look at them whenever you open the drawer. For some reason, having lighter clothes at the front seems to have a calming effect.","Now, within the \u201cDocuments area, including its underlying folders, examine each file and ask yourself: Do I need this document to get my job done? Will this document provide me with guidance or inspiration for future work? Does this document spark joy?

A tidy desk results in a higher evaluation of our character and capacity. This raises our self-esteem and increases our motivation. As a result, we work harder and our performance improves.","Am I having trouble getting rid of this because of an attachment to the past or because of a fear for the future? Ask this for every one of these items. As you do so, you\u2019ll begin to see a pattern in your ownership of things, a pattern that falls into one of three categories: attachment to the past, desire for stability in the future, or a combination of both.\u201d","Photos Cherish who you are now If you have been sorting and discarding things in the order I recommend, you have likely stumbled across photographs in many different places, perhaps stuck between books on a shelf, lying in a desk drawer, or hidden in a box of odds and ends. While many may already have been in albums, I\u2019m sure you found the odd photo or two enclosed with a letter or still encased in the envelope from the photo shop. (I don\u2019t know why so many people leave photos in these envelopes.) Because photos tend to emerge from the most unexpected places when we are sorting other categories, it is much more efficient to put them in a designated spot every time you find one and deal with them all at the very end. There is a good reason to leave photos for last. If you start sorting photos before you have honed your intuitive sense of what brings you joy, the whole process will spin out of control and come to a halt. In contrast, once you have followed the correct order for tidying (i.e., clothes, books, papers, komono, sentimental items), sorting will proceed smoothly, and you will be amazed by your capacity to choose on the basis of what gives you pleasure. There is only one way to sort photos, and you should keep in mind that it takes a little time. The correct method is to remove all your photos from their albums and look at them one by one. Those who protest that this is far too much work are people who have never truly sorted photos. Photographs exist only to show a specific event or time. For this reason, they must be looked at one by one. When you do this, you will be surprised at how clearly you can tell the difference between those that touch your heart and those that don\u2019t. As always, only keep the ones that inspire joy. With this method, you will keep only about five per day of a special trip, but this will be so representative of that time that they bring back the rest vividly. Really important things are not that great in number. Unexciting photos of scenery that you can\u2019t even place belong in the garbage. The meaning of a photo lies in the excitement and joy you feel when taking it. In many cases, the prints developed afterward have already outlived their purpose. Sometimes people keep a mass of photos in a big box with the intention of enjoying them someday in their old age. I can tell you now that \u201csomeday never comes. I can\u2019t count how many boxes of unsorted photographs I have seen that were left by someone who has passed away. A typical conversation with my clients goes something like this: \u201cWhat\u2019s in that box?\u201d \u201cPhotos.\u201d \u201cThen you can leave them to sort at the end.\u201d \u201cOh, but they aren\u2019t mine. They belonged to my grandfather.\u201d Every time I have this conversation it makes me sad. I can\u2019t help thinking that the lives of the deceased would have been that much richer if the space occupied by that box had been free when the person was alive. Besides, we shouldn\u2019t still be sorting photos when we reach old age. If you, too, are leaving this task for when you grow old, don\u2019t wait. Do it now. You will enjoy the photos far more when you are old if they are already in an album than if you have to move and sort through a heavy boxful of them.\u201d","I have a good reason for choosing off-season clothing for their first foray into this tidying gala. It\u2019s the easiest category for tuning in to one\u2019s intuition concerning what feels good.","reinforce a positive self-image by wearing clothes you love.","Everyone\u2019s job has different requirements, but the three main folders I use should fit many types of work. Current projects, with a subfolder for each project. (You should try to keep these to no more than ten. After all, how many of us are simultaneously working on more than ten projects? If you are, you\u2019ll learn in the next chapter how to tidy your time.) Records, which contain policies and procedures you regularly access. Usually, these files are provided by others and you typically don\u2019t modify them. Examples include legal contracts and employee files. Saved work, which consists of documents from past projects that you\u2019ll use in the future. Examples include files that can help you with new projects, like a presentation from a previous client that can be a good template for a future one. Other types of saved work can include research you\u2019ve done that could be helpful later, such as benchmarking of competitors or industry research. You may also want to save some projects to have a portfolio to show to prospective clients or new employees for training purposes. If you keep personal files in the same space, add a \u201cPersonal folder so you don\u2019t intermingle personal and work files. Keep digital documents organized. Staying organized is much easier once you have a small set of intuitive, primary folders. If you decide to keep a new file, put it in the most appropriate folder. Otherwise, delete it. The usefulness of your folders will improve as you consistently place similar files in the same place and keep only what you need. When projects are done, decide whether they warrant being moved to your \u201cSaved Work\u201d folder or if you can discard them. There\u2019s no need to store records such as company policies if they\u2019re accessible in other places or won\u2019t be needed again.\u201d","Quando uso il termine \xabelettrico\xbb, intendo tutti gli oggetti che hanno un \xabodore\xbb elettrico, che emanano una sorta di aroma pungente, formicolante; quindi procedete a riordinare il komomo elettrico usando questa sensazione come guida.","First, fold each lengthwise side of the garment toward the center (such as the left-hand, then right-hand, sides of a shirt) and tuck the sleeves in to make a long rectangular shape. It doesn\u2019t matter how you fold the sleeves. Next, pick up one short end of the rectangle and fold it toward the other short end. Then fold again, in the same manner, in halves or in thirds. The number of folds should be adjusted so that the folded clothing when standing on edge fits the height of the drawer. This is the basic principle that will ultimately allow your clothes to be stacked on edge, side by side, so that when you pull open your drawer you can see the edge of every item inside. If you find that the end result is the right shape but too loose and floppy to stand up, it\u2019s a sign that your way of folding doesn\u2019t match the type of clothing.

This time at home is still a precious part of living. Its value should not change just because nobody sees us. So, starting today, break the habit of downgrading clothes that don\u2019t thrill you to loungewear. The real waste is not discarding clothes you don\u2019t like but wearing them even though you are striving to create the ideal space for your ideal lifestyle. Precisely because no one is there to see you, it makes far more sense to reinforce a positive self-image by wearing clothes you love. The same goes for pajamas. If you are a woman, try wearing something elegant as nightwear. The worst thing you can do is to wear a sloppy sweat suit. I occasionally meet people who dress like this all the time, whether waking or sleeping. If sweatpants are your everyday attire, you\u2019ll end up looking like you belong in them, which is not very attractive. What you wear in the house does impact your self-image.","The Japanese word for healing is te-ate, which literally means \u201cto apply hands.","If you have read this far, you have probably noticed that in my method your feelings are the standard","People have trouble discarding things that they could still use (functional value), that contain helpful information (informational value), and that have sentimental ties (emotional value).

I recognize necessary information much more easily. Many of my clients, particularly those who have disposed of a substantial number of books and papers, have also mentioned this. For books, timing is everything. The moment you first encounter a particular book is the right time to read it. To avoid missing that moment, I recommend that you keep your collection small.","The goal should be to organize the contents so that you can see where every item is at a glance,","The first step is to visualize what the inside of your drawer will look like when you finish. The goal should be to organize the contents so that you can see where every item is at a glance, just as you can see the spines of the books on your bookshelves. The key is to store things standing up rather than laid flat. Some people mimic store displays, folding each piece of clothing into a large square and then arranging them one on top of the other in layers. This is great for temporary sales displays in stores, but not what we should be aiming for at home, where our relationship with these clothes is long term. To store clothes standing, they must be made compact, which means more folds. Some people believe that more folds means more wrinkles, but this is not the case. It is not the number of folds but rather the amount of pressure applied that causes wrinkling. Even lightly folded clothes will wrinkle if they are stored in a pile because the weight of the clothes acts like a press.","Can you truthfully say that you treasure something buried so deeply in a closet or drawer that you have forgotten its existence?","The key is to store things standing up rather than laid flat.","others may prefer to go naked in the home and therefore have no loungewear at all.

It is not hard to tidy up perfectly and completely in one fell swoop. In fact, anyone can do it.

Take a moment to draw an arrow rising toward the right and then another descending to the right. You can do this on paper or just trace them in the air. Did you notice that when you draw an arrow rising to the right it makes you feel lighter? Lines that slope up to the right make people feel comfortable. By using this principle when you organize your closet, you can make the contents look far more exciting. To do so, hang heavy items on the left side of the closet and light items on the right. Heavy items include those with length, those made from heavier material, and those that are dark in color. As you move toward the right side of the closet, the length of the clothing grows shorter, the material thinner, and the color lighter. By category, coats would be on the far left, followed by dresses, jackets, pants, skirts, and blouses.","tuck the sleeves in to make a long rectangular shape.

Never, ever ball up your socks. I pointed to the balled-up socks. \u201cLook at them carefully. This should be a time for them to rest. Do you really think they can get any rest like that? That\u2019s right. The socks and stockings stored in your drawer are essentially on holiday. They take a brutal beating in their daily work, trapped between your foot and your shoe, enduring pressure and friction to protect your precious feet. The time they spend in your drawer is their only chance to rest. But if they are folded over, balled up, or tied, they are always in a state of tension, their fabric stretched and their elastic pulled. They roll about and bump into each other every time the drawer is opened and closed. Any socks and stockings unfortunate enough to get pushed to the back of the drawer are often forgotten for so long that their elastic stretches beyond recovery. When the owner finally discovers them and puts them on, it will be too late and they will be relegated to the garbage.

It\u2019s not uncommon now to see people wearing T-shirts indoors even in winter. So it\u2019s time to abandon this custom and keep all our clothes ready to be used year-round, regardless of the season. My clients love this approach, especially because they can grasp at all times exactly what clothes they have. No difficult techniques are required. All you need to do is organize your clothes on the premise that you aren\u2019t going to put off-season clothes in storage. The trick is not to overcategorize.

As long as you do it right away.\u201d I never thought anything of this until my clientele expanded to homes in rural towns. When I learned the true state of parents\u2019 houses, I was forced to retract my rash words. Now I realize that people who have a convenient place to send things, such as a parents\u2019 house, are actually quite unfortunate.

This is precisely why success depends on experiencing tangible results immediately.

The criterion is, of course, whether or not it gives you a thrill of pleasure when you touch it. Remember, I said when you touch it. Make sure you don\u2019t start reading it. Reading clouds your judgment. Instead of asking yourself what you feel, you\u2019ll start asking whether you need that book or not.

For someone who loves books, what greater happiness could there be?","I can think of no greater happiness in life than to be surrounded only by the things I love. How about you?

I can\u2019t count how many times people have complained to me that they don\u2019t have enough room, but I have yet to see a house that lacked sufficient storage. The real problem is that we have far more than we need or want. Once you learn to choose your belongings properly, you will be left only with the amount that fits perfectly in the space you currently own. This is the true magic of tidying. It may seem incredible, but my method of keeping only what sparks joy in the heart is really that precise. This is why you must begin by discarding. Once you have done that, it\u2019s easy to decide where things should go because your possessions will have been reduced to a third or even a quarter of what you started out with.

Before you start getting rid of things, take the time to think this through carefully. This means visualizing the ideal lifestyle you dream of. If you skip this step, not only will it delay the whole process, but it will also put you at higher risk for rebound. Goals like \u201cI want to live clutter-free or \u201cI want to be able to put things away\u201d are too broad. You need to think much more deeply than that.

By category, coats would be on the far left, followed by dresses, jackets, pants, skirts, and blouses. This is the basic order, but depending on the trends in your wardrobe, what classifies as \u201cheavy in each category will differ.

Look more closely at what is there. I had been so focused on what to discard, on attacking the unwanted obstacles around me, that I had forgotten to cherish the things that I loved, the things I wanted to keep.

You cannot judge whether or not a book really grabs you when it\u2019s still on the shelf.

If you ask yourself, \u201cDoes this spark joy?\u201d when you are just looking at the things on your shelves or in your drawers, the question won\u2019t mean much to you. To truly decide whether you want to keep something or to dispose of it, you must take your things out of hibernation. Even the piles of books already on the floor will be easier to assess if you move them to a different part of the floor or restack them. Just like the gentle shake we use to wake someone up, we can stimulate our belongings by physically moving them, exposing them to fresh air and making them \u201cconscious.\u201d While helping my clients tidy their homes or offices, I stand in front of the mound of books they have piled on the floor and clap my hands, or I gently stroke the book covers. Although my clients look at me strangely at first, they are inevitably surprised at how quickly and precisely they are able to choose after this. They can see exactly what they need and don\u2019t need. It is much harder to choose books when they are still on the shelf, which means you will have to repeat the process later.

But surely the person who gave it to you doesn\u2019t want you to use it out of a sense of obligation, or to put it away without using it, only to feel guilty every time you see it.

Line up these sets in your closet or wardrobe where you can see them. I stand them on the top shelf. The process of storing bags inside another bag, of finding the right combinations, is a lot of fun, much like making a jigsaw puzzle.

Before choosing what to keep, collect everything that falls within the same category at one time. Take every last item out and lay everything in one spot. To demonstrate the steps involved, let\u2019s go back to the example of clothing above. You start by deciding that you are going to organize and put away your clothes. The next step is to search every room of the house. Bring every piece of clothing you find to the same place, and spread them out on the floor. Then pick up each outfit and see if it sparks joy. Those and only those are the ones to keep. Follow this procedure for every category. If you have too many clothes, you can make subcategories such as tops, bottoms, socks, and so on, and examine your clothes, one subcategory at a time. Gathering every item in one place is essential to this process because it gives you an accurate grasp of how much you have.","LIFE TRULY BEGINS only after you have put your house in order.","You will never use spare buttons. In most cases, when a button falls off, it\u2019s a sign that the particular shirt or blouse has been well worn and loved and has now reached the end of its life.

When you think about your future, is it worth keeping mementos of things that you would otherwise forget? We live in the present. No matter how wonderful things used to be, we cannot live in the past. The joy and excitement we feel here and now are more important. So, once again, the way to decide what to keep is to pick up each item and ask yourself, \u201cDoes this spark joy?","By handling each sentimental item and deciding what to discard, you process your past. If you just stow these things away in a drawer or cardboard box, before you realize it, your past will become a weight that holds you back and keeps you from living in the here and now.

It is therefore my policy to keep everything out of the bath or shower. Whatever is used in the bath should be dried after use anyway, so it makes far more sense to just wipe down the few items we use with our bath towel and then put them away in the cupboard. While this may seem like more work at first glance, it is actually less. It is much quicker and easier to clean the bath or shower without these items cluttering that space, and there will be less slime buildup. The same is true for the kitchen sink area. Do you keep your sponges and dish detergent by the sink? I store mine underneath it. The secret is to make sure the sponge is completely dry. Many people use a wire sponge rack with suction cups that stick to the sink. If you do, too, I recommend that you remove it immediately. It cannot dry out if it is sprayed with water every time you use the sink, and it will soon start to smell. To prevent this, squeeze your sponge tightly after use and hang it up to dry. You can use a clothespin to pin it to your towel rack or to the handle of a kitchen drawer if you don\u2019t have a rack. Personally, I recommend hanging sponges outside, such as on the veranda.","A Father\u2019s Day present with the words \u201cThanks, Dad.

Not only is it economical, but it can also be a source of great joy to see these things being enjoyed and treasured by someone close to you. But that is not the same as forcing things onto your family members because you can\u2019t bring yourself to discard or donate them. Whether the victim is a sibling, a parent, or a child, this particular custom should be banned. Although my sister never complained, I am sure that she must have had mixed feelings when she accepted my hand-me-downs. Basically, I was simply transferring my guilt at not being able to discard them onto her. In retrospect, that was pretty despicable. If you want to give something away, don\u2019t push people to take it unconditionally or pressure them by making them feel guilty. Find out in advance what they like,","dry not only my sponges but also my cutting boards, colanders, and dishes on my veranda. Sunlight is a good disinfectant, and my kitchen always looks very tidy because I don\u2019t need a dish rack. In fact, I don\u2019t even own a dish rack. I put all the dishes I wash into a large bowl or colander and place this on the veranda to dry. I can wash them in the morning and just leave them outside. This is an excellent solution for people living on their own or for those who don\u2019t use many dishes. Where do you store your oil, salt, pepper, soy sauce, and other seasonings? Many people keep them right beside the stove because they want them close at hand for the sake of convenience. If you are one of these people, I hope you will rescue them right now. For one thing, a counter is for preparing food, not for storing things. Counter space beside the stove, in particular, is exposed to splatters of food and oil, and the seasonings kept here are usually sticky with grease. Rows of bottles in this area also make it much harder to keep clean, and the kitchen area will always be covered in a film of oil. Kitchen shelves and cupboards are usually designed to store seasonings and spices, so put them away where they belong. Quite often, a long, narrow drawer is located next to the oven that can be used for this purpose.","Never, ever ball up your socks.","And what about things from your own childhood? Do you still keep your report cards or graduation certificates? When my client pulled out a school uniform from forty years ago, even I felt my heart constrict with emotion.

By now, the person who wrote it has long forgotten what he or she wrote and even the letter\u2019s very existence. As for accessories you received as gifts, keep them only if they bring you pure joy. If you are keeping them because you can\u2019t forget a former boyfriend, it\u2019s better to discard or donate them.

They take a brutal beating in their daily work, trapped between your foot and your shoe, enduring pressure and friction to protect your precious feet. The time they spend in your drawer is their only chance to rest. But if they are folded over, balled up, or tied, they are always in a state of tension, their fabric stretched and their elastic pulled.

But how does this create the right mind-set? When you tidy your space completely, you transform the scenery. The change is so profound that you feel as if you are living in a totally different world. This deeply affects your mind and inspires a strong aversion to reverting to your previously cluttered state. The key is to make the change so sudden that you experience a complete change of heart. The same impact can never be achieved if the process is gradual. To achieve a sudden change like this, you need to use the most efficient method of tidying.

And this is not an isolated case. In my work, the volume discarded by younger sisters is always greater than the volume discarded by older sisters, a phenomenon surely related to the fact that younger children are often accustomed to wearing hand-me-downs. There are two reasons why younger sisters tend to collect clothes they don\u2019t really like. One is that it\u2019s hard to get rid of something received from family. The other is that they don\u2019t really know what they like, which makes it hard to decide whether they should part with it. Because they receive so much clothing from others, they don\u2019t really need to shop and therefore they have less opportunity to develop the instinct for what really inspires joy.","Over the next two days we went through his things in the correct order of clothes, books, papers, komono, and sentimental items.","Rather than buying something to make do for now, wait until you have completed the entire process and then take your time looking for storage items that you really like.","I had begun to see my things and even my house as an adversary that I had to beat, and I was constantly in fighting mode.","It might be a good rule to get rid of anything that you\'d be embarrassed for others to see if you died.","La gente no cambia de h\xe1bitos si primero no cambia su manera de pensar. \xa1Y eso no es f\xe1cil!","I had been so focused on using the turntable to create an amazing storage space that I had failed to really see what I was storing\u2014bottles that slide and topple easily.","As we\u2019ve seen, there are only two tasks involved\u2014discarding and deciding where to keep things.

In the middle of discarding, they start thinking about where to put things. As soon as they think, \u201cI wonder if it will fit in this drawer, the work of discarding comes to a halt.

The general assumption, in Japan at least, is that tidying doesn\u2019t need to be taught but rather is picked up naturally. Cooking skills and recipes are passed down as family traditions from grandmother to mother to daughter, yet one never hears of anyone passing on the family secrets of tidying, even within the same household.","Balling your socks and stockings, or tying them into knots, is cruel.

If we overlook this vital point, we are likely to create a system that results in clutter. For people like me who are naturally lazy, I strongly recommend focusing storage in one spot. More often than not, the notion that it\u2019s more convenient to keep everything within arm\u2019s reach is a biased assumption.","People have trouble discarding things that they could still use (functional value), that contain helpful information (informational value), and that have sentimental ties (emotional value). When these things are hard to obtain or replace (rarity), they become even harder to part with. The process of deciding what to keep and what to discard will go much more smoothly if you begin with items that are easier to make decisions about. As you gradually work toward the harder categories, you will be honing your decision-making skills. Clothes are the easiest because their rarity value is extremely low.","The Japanese believed that gods resided not only in natural phenomena such as the sea and the land but also in the cooking stove and even in each individual grain of rice, and therefore they treated all of them with reverence.","Tops (shirts, sweaters, etc.) Bottoms (pants, skirts, etc.) Clothes that should be hung (jackets, coats, suits, etc.) Socks Underwear Bags (handbags, messenger bags, etc.) Accessories (scarves, belts, hats, etc.) Clothes for specific events (swimsuits, kimonos, uniforms, etc.) Shoes","Up to now, I believed it was important to do things that added to my life, so I took seminars and studied to increase my knowledge.

This, however, is a waste. If you consider the rent or mortgage you pay, turning your space into a storage shed for empty boxes costs you more than what you could earn selling an appliance in a box. You don\u2019t need to keep them for moving either. You can worry about finding suitable boxes when the time comes.

I feel that noise makes it harder to hear the internal dialogue between the owner and his or her belongings. Listening to the TV is, of course, out of the question.

If you can\u2019t feel relaxed in a clean and tidy room, try confronting your feeling of anxiety. It may shed light on what is really bothering you. When your room is clean and uncluttered, you have no choice but to examine your inner state. You can see any issues you have been avoiding and are forced to deal with them. From the moment you start tidying, you will be compelled to reset your life. As a result, your life will start to change.

The true goal should be to establish the lifestyle you want most once your house has been put in order. Storage experts are hoarders What is the first problem that comes to mind when you think of tidying?\u201d","So if, like many of my clients, you have any books that fall into this category, I urge you to stop insisting that you will use them someday. Get rid of them today.","No cada persona que conozcas en la vida se convertir\xe1 en tu amigo \xedntimo o tu amante. Con algunos te costar\xe1 trabajo llevarte bien y otros nunca te agradar\xe1n. Pero tambi\xe9n esas personas te ense\xf1an la preciosa lecci\xf3n de quienes s\xed te agradan, de modo que apreciar\xe1s a\xfan m\xe1s a esas personas especiales.","When a woman who is very anxious about the future chooses a partner, for example, she is less likely to select someone purely because she likes and enjoys being with him. She might choose someone she doesn\u2019t really like simply because the relationship seems advantageous to her or because she is afraid that if she doesn\u2019t choose him, she may not find anyone else. When it comes to career choices, the same type of person is more likely to choose a job with a large company because it will give her more choices in the future, or to work toward certain qualifications as a guarantee rather than because she actually likes the work and wants to do it.","It is not our memories but the person we have become because of those past experiences that we should treasure. This is the lesson these keepsakes teach us when we sort them. The space in which we live should be for the person we are becoming now, not for the person we were in the past. Photos","However, the moment you start focusing on how to choose what to throw away, you have actually veered significantly off course. In this state, it is extremely risky to continue tidying.","Still, let me repeat: tidying should be done just once. Or, to put it more accurately, the work of tidying should be completed once and for all within a single period of time.","One of the magical effects of tidying is confidence in your decision-making capacity... People who lack confidence in their judgment lack confidence in themselves.","To me, it doesn\u2019t seem right to keep clothes we don\u2019t enjoy for relaxing around the house. This time at home is still a precious part of living. Its value should not change just because nobody sees us. So, starting today, break the habit of downgrading clothes that don\u2019t thrill you to loungewear.","Place every item of clothing in the house on the floor","Make sure that you keep all such papers in one spot only. Never let them spread to other parts of the house. I","By acknowledging their contribution and letting them go with gratitude, you will be able to truly put the things you own, and your life, in order. In the end, all that will remain are the things that you really treasure.","Va\u0161a myse\u013e ur\u010duje hodnotu v\u0161etk\xe9mu, \u010do vlastn\xedte.","But I think the main reason tidying has this effect is because through this process people come to know contentment. After tidying, many clients tell me that their worldly desires have decreased. Whereas in the past, no matter how many clothes they had, they were never satisfied and always wanted something new to wear, once they selected and kept only those things that they really loved, they felt that they had everything they needed.","That\u2019s right. By handling each sentimental item and deciding what to discard, you process your past. If you just stow these things away in a drawer or cardboard box, before you realize it, your past will become a weight that holds you back and keeps you from living in the here and now. To put your things in order means to put your past in order, too. It\u2019s like resetting your life and settling your accounts so that you can take the next step forward.","If they start with clothes they are currently using, clients are more likely to think, \u201cIt doesn\u2019t spark joy, but I just wore it yesterday, or \u201cIf I don\u2019t have any clothes left to wear, what am I going to do?\u201d This makes it harder for them to make an objective decision. Because off-season clothes are not imminently necessary, it is much easier to apply the simple criterion of whether or not they bring you joy. There\u2019s one question I recommend asking when you select off-season clothes. \u201cDo I want to see this outfit again next time it\u2019s in season?\u201d Or, to rephrase it, \u201cWould I want to wear this right away if the temperature suddenly changed?\u201d","The basic order for sorting komono is as follows: 1. CDs, DVDs 2. Skin care products 3. Makeup 4. Accessories 5. Valuables (passports, credit cards, etc.) 6. Electrical equipment and appliances (digital cameras, electric cords, anything that seems vaguely \u201celectric) 7. Household equipment (stationary and writing materials, sewing kits, etc.) 8. Household supplies (expendables like medicine, detergents, tissues, etc.) 9. Kitchen goods/food supplies (spatulas, pots, blenders, etc.) 10. Other (spare change, figurines, etc.)\u201d","Deciding what to keep on the basis of what sparks joy in your heart is the most important step in tidying.","Per quanti oggetti possediate, la loro quantit\xe0 \xe8 pur sempre limitata. Se riuscite a scoprire quali oggetti vi danno gioia e a decidere dove riporli, il riordino finir\xe0, prima o poi. Pi\xf9 andate avanti, pi\xf9 vi avvicinate all\'obiettivo di avere una casa piena di felicit\xe0.","Your goal is clearly in sight. The moment you have put everything in its place, you have crossed the finish line.","As you run your hands over the cloth, you pour your energy into it. The Japanese word for healing is te-ate, which literally means \u201cto apply hands. The term originated prior to the development of modern medicine when people believed that placing one\u2019s hand on an injury promoted healing. We know that gentle physical contact from a parent, such as holding hands, patting a child on the head, and hugging, has a calming effect on children. Likewise, a firm but gentle massage by human hands does much more to loosen knotted muscles than being pummeled by a massage machine. The energy that flows from the person\u2019s hands into our skin seems to heal both body and soul. The same is true for clothing. When we take our clothes in our hands and fold them neatly, we are, I believe, transmitting energy, which has a positive effect on our clothes. Folding properly pulls the cloth taut and erases wrinkles, and makes the material stronger and more vibrant.\u201d","The goal of the method shared in this book is not just to have a nice neat desk but to begin a dialogue with yourself through tidying - to discover what you value by exploring why you are working in the first place and what of working style you want. This process will help you see how each task you do is linked to a joyful future.","Marathon tidying produces a heap of garbage. At this stage, the one disaster that can wreak more havoc than an earthquake is the entrance of that recycling expert who goes by the alias of \u201cmother.","Putting your house in order is fun! The process of assessing how you feel about the things you own, identifying those that have fulfilled their purpose, expressing your gratitude, and bidding them farewell, is really about examining your inner self, a rite of passage to a new life. The yardstick by which you judge is your intuitive sense of attraction, and therefore there\u2019s no need for complex theories or numerical data. All you need to do is follow the right order.","One of the reasons clutter eats away at us is because we have to search for something just to find out whether it\u2019s even there, and many times, no matter how much we search, we cannot seem to find what we are looking for.","Presents are not \u201cthings but a means for conveying someone\u2019s feelings. When viewed from this perspective, you don\u2019t need to feel guilty for parting with a gift.\u201d","Once the process of tidying is under way, many of my clients remark that they have lost weight or that they have firmed up their tummies. It\u2019s a very strange phenomenon, but when we reduce what we own and essentially \u201cdetox our house, it has a detox effect on our bodies as well. When we discard everything in one go, which sometimes means disposing of forty garbage bags of stuff in one day, our bodies may respond in a way that resembles a short fast. We may get a bout of diarrhea or break out in pimples. There is nothing wrong with this. Our bodies are just getting rid of toxins that have built up over the years, and they will be back to normal, or in fact in even better shape, within a day or two. One of my clients cleared out a closet and shed that she had neglected for ten years. Immediately after, she had a strong bout of diarrhea after which she felt much lighter. I know it sounds like false advertising to claim that you can lose weight by tidying or that it will make your skin clearer, but it is not necessarily untrue.\u201d","The many days I spent tidying without seeing permanent results now seem hard to believe. In contrast, I feel happy and content. I have time to experience bliss in my quiet space, where even the air feels fresh and clean; time to sit and sip herbal tea while I reflect on my day.","The whole point in both discarding and keeping things is to be happy. It may seem obvious, but it is important to experience this realization for yourself and let it sink into your heart.","decreased.","If you let the temporary relief achieved by tidying up your physical space deceive you, you will never recognize the need to clean up your psychological space.","quirk","One reason so many of us never succeed at tidying is because we have too much stuff. This excess is caused by our ignorance of how much we actually own. When we disperse storage of a particular item throughout the house and tidy one place at a time, we can never grasp the overall volume and therefore can never finish. To escape this negative spiral, tidy by category, not by place.","Believe me. Until you have completed the once-in-a-lifetime event of putting your house in order, any attempt to tidy on a daily basis is doomed to failure. Conversely, once you have put your house in order, tidying will be reduced to the very simple task of putting things back where they belong. In fact, this becomes an unconscious habit. I use the term \u2018special event\u2019 because it is crucial to tackle this job within a short space of time while you are energised and excited about what you are doing.","your heart? Do you think that owning accessories you","a messy room equals a messy mind.","The term \u201ctops includes clothes for every season, from T-shirts and camisoles to knitted sweaters.\u201d","I do, however, have confidence in my environment. When it comes to the things I own, the clothes I wear, the house I live in, and the people in my life, when it comes to my environment as a whole, although it may not seem particularly special to anyone else, I am confident and extremely grateful to be surrounded by what I love, by things and people that are, each and every one, special, precious, and exceedingly dear to me.","I usually say, \u201cLet\u2019s start with off-season clothes. I have a good reason for choosing off-season clothing for their first foray into this tidying gala. It\u2019s the easiest category for tuning in to one\u2019s intuition concerning what feels good. If they start with clothes they are currently using, clients are more likely to think, \u201cIt doesn\u2019t spark joy, but I just wore it yesterday,\u201d or \u201cIf I don\u2019t have any clothes left to wear, what am I going to do?\u201d This makes it harder for them to make an objective decision. Because off-season clothes are not imminently necessary, it is much easier to apply the simple criterion of whether or not they bring you joy.\u201d","A verdadeira fun\xe7\xe3o de um presente \xe9 ser recebido.

Well, not necessarily.\u2026 If that\u2019s how you feel, throw it in the discard or donate pile. And if you got a lot of wear out of it last season, don\u2019t forget to express your appreciation. You might fear that you\u2019ll have no clothes left if you use this standard. But don\u2019t worry. It may seem as if you have discarded an awful lot, but as long as you are choosing clothes that give you pleasure, you\u2019ll be left with the amount you need.\u201d","and keep only those things that inspire joy.","The most important points to remember are these: Make sure you gather every piece of clothing in the house and be sure to handle each one."]')}}]);
