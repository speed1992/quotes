Non nostrum inter vos tantas componere lites (Virgil).","Were you ever in France, Mr. Martin?\\" said Candide. \\"Yes,\\" said Martin, \\"I have been in several provinces. In some one-half of the people are fools, in others they are too cunning; in some they are weak and simple, in others they affect to be witty; in all, the principal occupation is love, the next is slander, and the third is talking nonsense.\\" \\"But, Mr. Martin, have you seen Paris?\\" \\"Yes, I have. All these kinds are found there. It is a chaos\u2014a confused multitude, where everybody seeks pleasure and scarcely any one finds it, at least as it appeared to me. I made a short stay there. On my arrival I was robbed of all I had by pickpockets at the fair of St. Germain. I myself was taken for a robber and was imprisoned for eight days, after which I served as corrector of the press to gain the money necessary for my return to Holland on foot. I knew the whole scribbling rabble, the party rabble, the fanatic rabble. It is said that there are very polite people in that city, and I wish to believe it.","Every evil begets some good.","L\'homme est n\xe9 pour vivre dans les convulsions de l\'inqui\xe9tude ou dans la l\xe9thargie de l\'ennui.","Meanwhile, all the travellers whom Candide met in the inns along his route, said to him, \\"We go to Paris.\\" This general eagerness at length gave him, too, a desire to see this capital; and it was not so very great a d\xe9tour from the road to Venice. He entered Paris by the suburb of St. Marceau, and fancied that he was in the dirtiest village of Westphalia. Scarcely was Candide arrived at his inn, than he found himself attacked by a slight illness, caused by fatigue. As he had a very large diamond on his finger, and the people of the inn had taken notice of a prodigiously heavy box among his baggage, there were two physicians to attend him, though he had never sent for them, and two devotees who warmed his broths. \\"I remember,\\" Martin said, \\"also to have been sick at Paris in my first voyage; I was very poor, thus I had neither friends, devotees, nor doctors, and I recovered.","Descartes gave sight to the blind. These saw the errors of antiquity and of the sciences. The path he struck out is since become boundless [....] In fathoming this abyss no bottom has been found. We are now to examine what discoveries Sir Isaac Newton has made in it.","By what incomprehensible mechanism are our organs held in subjection to sentiment and thought? How is it that a single melancholy idea shall disturb the whole course of the blood; and that the blood should in turn communicate irregularities to the human understanding? What is that unknown fluid which certainly exists and which, quicker and more active than light, flies in less than the twinkling of an eye into all the channels of life,\u2014produces sensations, memory, joy or grief, reason or frenzy,\u2014recalls with horror what we would choose to forget; and renders a thinking animal, either a subject of admiration, or an object of pity and compassion?","Consequently they who assert that all is well have said a foolish thing, they should have said all is for the best.","The moment of meeting, and that of parting are the two greatest epochs of life as sayeth the great book of Zend.","I do not know by what power I think; but well I know that I should never have thought without the assistance of my senses.

Throughout Italy we write only what we do not think; and the present inhabitants of the country of the Caesars and Antonines dare not acquire a single idea without the permission of a Dominican father. I should be enamored of the spirit of the English nation, did it not utterly frustrate the good effects it would produce by passion and the spirit of party.\u201dCandide, seeing a Milton, asked the senator if he did not think that author a great man. \u201cWho?\u201d said Pococurante sharply; \u201cthat barbarian who writes a tedious commentary in ten books of rumbling verse, on the first chapter of Genesis? that slovenly imitator of the Greeks, who disfigures the creation, by making the Messiah take a pair of compasses fromHeaven\u2019s armory to plan the world; whereas Moses represented the Diety as producing the whole universe by his fiat? Can I think you have any esteem for a writer who has spoiled Tasso\u2019s Hell and the Devil; who transforms Lucifer sometimes into a toad, and at others into apygmy; who makes him say the same thing over again a hundred times; who metamorphoses him into a school\u2013divine; and who, by an absurdly serious imitation of Ariosto\u2019s comic invention of firearms, represents the devils and angels cannonading each other in Heaven? Neither I nor any other Italian can possibly take pleasure in such melancholyreveries; but the marriage of Sin and Death, and snakes issuing from the womb of the former, are enough to make any person sick that is not lost to all sense of delicacy. This obscene, whimsical, and disagreeable poem met with the neglect it deserved at its first publication; and I onlytreat the author now as he was treated in his own country by his contemporaries.\u201d","I scarce ever knew a city that did not wish the destruction of its neighbouring city, nor a family that did not desire to exterminate some other family.

A theologian, a missionary, or a partisan of any description, is always for conquering like a prince, and there are many more sects than there are sovereigns in the world\u2026. I conclude, that every sensible man, every honest man, ought to hold Christianity in abhorrence. \u2018The great name of Theist, which we can never sufficiently revere,\u2019 is the only name we ought to adopt. The only gospel we should read is the grand book of nature, written with God\u2019s own hand, and stamped with his own seal. The only religion we ought to profess is, \'to adore God, and act like honest men.\u2019 It would be as impossible for this simple and eternal religion to produce evil, as it would be impossible for Christian fanaticism not to produce it\u2026.

I tell you to rid yourselves of this beast, and you ask me what you shall put in its place! Is it you that put this question to me? Then you are a hundred times more odious than the Pagan Pontiffs, who permitted themselves to enjoy tranquility among their ceremonies and sacrifices, who did not attempt to enslave the mind by dogmas, who never disputed the powers of the magistrates, and who introduced no discord among mankind.

Creech, the commentator on Lucretius, marked upon his manuscripts: \u201cN. B. Must hang myself when I have finished.

Plato observed a long while ago that those stomachs are not the best that reject all sorts of food.\\"\\"But is there not a pleasure,\\" said Candide, \\"in criticising everything, in pointing out faults where others see nothing but beauties?","The abbe of Perigord offered his service to introduce him to her at her own house. Candide, who was brought up in Germany, desired to know what might be the ceremonial used on those occasions, and how a queen of England was treated in France. \u201cThere is a necessary distinction to be observed in these matters, said the abbe. \u201cIn a country town we take them to a tavern; here in Paris, they are treated with great respect during their lifetime, provided they are handsome, and when they die we throw their bodies upon adunghill.\u201d","I exist, you will say; but is this existence always a benefit?","Quise suicidarmemontones de veces, pero a pesar de todo amaba la vida.

world that it is very probable he may be in me as well aseverywhere else; but I must confess, when I cast my eye on this globe, or rather globule, I cannot help thinking that God has abandoned it to some malignant being. I always except El Dorado. I scarce ever knew a city that did not wish the destruction of its neighboring city; nor afamily that did not desire to exterminate some other family. The poor in all parts of the world bear an inveterate hatred to the rich, even while they creep and cringe to them; and the rich treat the poor like sheep, whose wool and flesh they barter for money; a million of regimentedassassins traverse Europe from one end to the other, to get their bread by regular depredation and murder, because it is the most gentlemanlike profession. Even in those cities which seem to enjoy theblessings of peace, and where the arts flourish, the inhabitants are devoured with envy, care, and inquietudes, which are greater plagues than any experienced in a town besieged. Private chagrins are still more dreadful than public calamities.
