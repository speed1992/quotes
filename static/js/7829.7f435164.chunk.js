When artists get together, they talk about money.","The secret to life is to enjoy the pleasure of being terribly, terribly deceived.","The soul is born old but grows young. That is the comedy of life.","The most terrible thing about it is not that it breaks one\u2019s heart\u2014hearts are made to be broken\u2014but that it turns one\u2019s heart to stone.","we always misunderstood ourselves, and rarely understood others","I like persons better than principles, and I like persons with no principles better than anything else in the world.","If people were meant to be nude, they would have been born this way.","Beauty is the only thing that time cannot harm.","Prayer must never be answered: if it is, it ceases to be prayer and becomes correspondence.","The systems that fail are those that rely on the permanency of human nature, and not its growth and development.","To live in this world is a rare thing; most people just exist.","The heart was made to be broken.","I have the simplest tastes.

A woman\'s face is her work of fiction.","The aim of love is to love. No more, no less.","I never approve, or disapprove, of anything now. It is an absurd attitude to take towards life.

If a personality fascinates me, whatever mode of expression that personality selects is absolutely delightful to me.","Some things are more precious because they don\'t last long.","To make men Socialists is nothing, but to make Socialism human is a great thing.","They spoil every romance by trying to make it last forever.","Because sometimes you have to do something bad to do something good.","Art is individualism, and individualism is a disturbing and disintegrating force. There lies its immense value. For what it seeks is to disturb monotony of type, slavery of custom, tyranny of habit, and the reduction of man to the level of a machine.

It makes me far too conceited.","Yet each man kills the thing he loves, By each let this be heard, Some do it with a bitter look, Some with a flattering word, The coward does it with a kiss, The brave man with a sword! Some kill their love when they are young, And some when they are old; Some strangle with the hands of Lust, Some with the hands of Gold: The kindest use a knife, because The dead so soon grow cold. Some love too little, some too long, Some sell, and others buy; Some do the deed with many tears, And some without a sigh: For each man kills the thing he loves, Yet each man does not die.","Man is least himself when he talks in his own person. Give him a mask, and he will tell you the truth.","Love is like a war; easy to start but hard to end and you never know where it might take you.","No man dies for what he knows to be true. Men die for what they want to be true, for what some terror in their hearts tells them is not true.","There is one thing infinitely more pathetic than to have lost the woman one is in love with, and that is to have won her and found out how shallow she is!","A work of art is the unique result of a unique temperament. Its beauty comes from the fact that the author is what he is.

They make their God first and worship him afterwards.","But what is the good of friendship if one cannot say exactly what one means? Anybody can say charming things and try to please and to flatter, but a true friend always says unpleasant things, and does not mind giving pain. Indeed, if he is a really true friend he prefers it, for he knows that then he is doing good.","Fashion is a form of ugliness so intolerable that we have to alter it every six months.","Art only begins where Imitation ends.","When a woman marries again, it is because she detested her first husband. When a man marries again, it is because he adored his first wife. Women try their luck; men risk theirs.","The best people to work for are me, myself and I.","The reason we all like to think so well of others is that we are all afraid for ourselves. The basis of optimism is sheer terror.","A mask tells us more than a face.","Duty is what one expects from others.","A true gentleman is one who is never intentionally rude.","The sick do not ask if the hand that smoothes their pillow is pure, nor the dying care if the lips that touch their brow have known the kiss of sin.","They get up early, because they have so much to do, and go to bed early, because they have so little to think about.","Without order nothing can exist-without chaos nothing can evolve. Nowadays people know the price of everything and the value of nothing.","Every little action of the common day makes or unmakes character.","Scandal is gossip made tedious by morality.","The only way to get rid of a temptation is to yield to it. Resist it, and your soul grows sick with longing for the things it has forbidden to itself, with desire for what its monstrous laws have made monstrous and unlawful.","I never travel without my diary.

What they call their loyalty, and their fidelity, I call either the lethargy of custom or their lack of imagination.. Faithfulness is to the emotional life what consistency is to the life of the intellect---simply a confession of failures. Faithfulness! I must analyse it some day. The passion for property is in it. There are many things that we would throw away if we were not afraid that others might pick them up. But I don\'t want to interrupt you. Go on with your story.","I don\'t want to earn a living. I want to live.","Women are never disarmed by compliments. Men always are. That is the difference between the sexes.","I like talking to a brick wall- it\'s the only thing in the world that never contradicts me!","Looking good and dressing well is a necessity. Having a purpose in life is not.","Behind joy and laughter there may be a temperament, coarse, hard and callous. But behind sorrow there is always sorrow. Pain, unlike pleasure, wears no mask. ... For this reason there is no truth comparable to sorrow. There are times when sorrow seems to me to be the only truth. Other things may be illusions of the eye or the appetite, made to blind the one and cloy the other, but out of sorrow have the worlds been built, and at the birth of a child or a star there is pain.","In America the young are always ready to give to those who are older than themselves the full benefits of their inexperience.","Patriotism is the virtue of the vicious.","There is no such thing as morality or immorality in thought.

The Japanese people are ... simply a mode of style, an exquisite fancy of art.","What a pity that in life we only get our lessons when they are of no use to us.","The supreme object of life is to live.

Music always seems to me to produce that effect. It creates for one a past of which one has been ignorant, and fills one with a sense of sorrows that have been hidden from one\u2019s tears.","Appearance blinds, whereas words reveal.","If you are not long, I will wait for you all my life.","Those who have much are often greedy.

One should sympathise with the colour, the beauty, the joy of life. The less said about life\'s sores the better.","One can live for years sometimes without living at all, and then all life comes crowding into one single hour.","Keep love in your heart. A life without it is like a sunless garden when the flowers are dead.","Everything in moderation, including moderation.","A man can\'t be too careful in the choice of his enemies.","What a silly thing love is! It is not half as useful as logic, for it does not prove anything and it is always telling one things that are not going to happen, and making one believe things that are not true.","Good intentions are invariably ungrammatical.","Ridicule is the tribute paid to the genius by the mediocrities.","The advantage of the emotions is that they lead us astray.","Mere color, unspoiled by meaning, and unallied with definite form, can speak to the soul in a thousand different ways.","Most people die of a sort of creeping common sense, and discover when it is too late that the only things one never regrets are one\'s mistakes.","One should absorb the colour of life, but one should never remember its details. Details are always vulgar.","Ones real life is often the life that one does not lead.","A man who is master of himself can end a sorrow as easily as he can invent a pleasure.","History is only gossip.","A work of art is the unique result of a unique temperament.","Most people live for love and admiration. But it is by love and admiration that we should live.","Each of the professions means a prejudice. The necessity for a career forces every one to take sides. We live in the age of the overworked, and the under-educated; the age in which people are so industrious that they become absolutely stupid.","Pleasure without Champagne is purely artificial.","Every one is worthy of love, except him who thinks that he is. Love is a sacrament that should be taken kneeling.","Indeed, as any one who has ever worked among the poor knows only too well, the brotherhood of man is no mere poet\'s dream, it is a most depressing and humiliating reality.","Men become old, but they never become good.","I put all my genius into my life; I put only my talent into my works.","Genius is born-not paid","I wrote when I did not know life;\\nnow that I do know the meaning of life,\\nI have no more to write.\\nLife cannot be written; life can only be lived.","The only horrible thing in the world is ennui.","I have put my talent into writing, my genius I have saved for living.","A virtuous abstinence from the joys of pederasty comes most easily to those who have no taste for it.","Everything popular is wrong.","I like men who have a future and women who have a past.","The great events of the world take place in the brain.","The well bred contradict other people. The wise contradict themselves.","Men always want to be a woman\'s first love. That is their clumsy vanity. We women have a more subtle instinct about things.","What is a cynic? A man who knows the price of everything and the value of nothing.","Deceiving others. That is what the world calls a romance.","Where there is no love there is no understanding.","The simplicity of your character makes you exquisitely incomprehensible to me.","Intuition is a strange instinct that tells a woman she is right, whether she is or not.","When the gods wish to punish us they answer our prayers.","The true perfection of man lies not in what man has, but in what man is.","Give children beauty, not the record of bloody slaughters and barbarous brawls, as they call history, or of the latitude and longitude of places nobody cares to visit, as they call geography.","Genius learns from nature, its own nature. Talent learns from art.","Beauty is a form of genius -- is higher, indeed, than genius, as it needs no explanation.","Art is the most intense mode of individualism that the world has known.","I am a man of simple pleasures. The best suits me perfectly.","Consistency is the last refuge of the unimagininative.","I am always astonishing myself. It is the only thing that makes life worth living.","The public is wonderfully tolerant. It forgives everything except genius.","Sometimes the poor are praised for being thrifty.

It is like advising a man who is starving to eat less.","A man who moralizes is a hypocrite, and a woman who does so is invariably plain.","After the first glass, you see things as you wish they were. After the second, you see things as they are not. Finally, you see things as they really are, and that is the most horrible thing in the world.","Hearts Live By Being Wounded","It is awfully hard work doing nothing.","To get back my youth I would do anything in the world, except take exercise, get up early, or be respectable.","Public opinion exists only where there are no ideas.","Every woman is a rebel.","Rich bachelors should be heavily taxed. It is not fair that some men should be happier than others.","Now, nothing should be able to harm a man except himself. Nothing should be able to rob a man at all. What a man really has, is what is in him. What is outside of him should be a matter of no importance.","Finding the meaning of life is easy. Simply get a dictionary, go to the \'L\' section, and find the word \'life.\'","Even now I cannot help feeling that it is a mistake to think that the passion one feels in creation is ever really shown in the work one creates.","One should always be a little improbable.","To expect the unexpected shows a thoroughly modern intellect.","What is said of man is nothing; the point is, who says it.","A woman who cannot make her mistakes charming, is only a female.","Genius lasts longer than beauty","Now it seems to me that love of some kind is the only possible explanation of the extraordinary amount of suffering that there is in the world. I cannot conceive of any other explanation. I am convinced that there is no other, and that if the world has indeed, as I have said, been built of sorrow, it has been built by the hands of love, because in no other way could the soul of man, for whom the world was made, reach the full stature of its perfection. Pleasure for the beautiful body, but pain for the beautiful soul.","Too much work, and no vacation, Deserves at least a small libation. So hail! my friends, and raise your glasses, Work\'s the curse of the drinking classes.","Quotation is a serviceable substitute for wit.","It is so easy to convince others; it is so difficult to convince oneself.","When people talk to me about the weather, I always feel they mean something else.","I prefer women with a past. They\'re always so damned amusing to talk to.","A bishop keeps on saying at the age of eighty what he was told to say at the age of eighteen.","I am afraid he has one of those terribly weak natures that are susceptible to influence.","One\'s dreams must be big enough so as not to lose sight of them.","Credit is a young man\'s capital.","All charming people, I fancy, are spoiled. It is the secret of their attraction.","A man who pays his bills on time is soon forgotten.","Now art should never try to be popular.

Sooner or later one comes to that dreadful universal thing called human nature.","In war,\\" answered the weaver, \\"the strong make slaves of the weak, and in peace the rich make slaves of the poor. We must work to live, and they give us such mean wages that we die. We toil for them all day long, and they heap up gold in their coffers, and our children fade away before their time, and the faces of those we love become hard and evil. We tread out the grapes, another drinks the wine. We sow the corn, and our own board is empty. We have chains, though no eye beholds them; and are slaves, though men call us free.","Veil after veil of thin dusky gauze is lifted, and by degrees the forms and colours of things are restored to them, and we watch the dawn remaking the world in its antique pattern.","Morality, like art, means drawing a line someplace.","The Roman Catholic Church is for saints and sinners alone - for respectable people, the Anglican Church will do.","Reported as Oscar Wilde\'s last words on his death bed... This wallpaper is killing me. One of us has to go.","The one person who has more illusions than the dreamer is the man of action.","A live unexamined isn\'t worth living. I will add, \\"A life unlived isn\'t worth examining.","But beauty, real beauty, ends where an intellectual expression begins. Intellect is in itself a mode of exaggeration, and destroys the harmony of any face. The moment one sits down to think, one becomes all nose, or all forehead, or something horrid. Look at the successful men in any of the learned professions. How perfectly hideous they are! Except, of course, in the Church. But then in the Church they don\'t think.","The secret of life is in art.","You silly Arthur! If you knew anything about...anything, which you don\'t, you would know that I adore you. Everyone in London knows it except you. It is a public scandal the way I adore you. I have been going about for the last six months telling the whole of society that I adore you. I wonder you consent to have anything to say to me. I have no character left at all. At least, I feel so happy that I am quite sure I have no character left at all.","You love the beauty that you can see and touch and handle, the beauty that you can destroy, and do destroy, but of the unseen beauty of life, of the unseen beauty of a higher life, you know nothing.","To be good is to be in harmony with oneself. Discord is to be forced to be in harmony with others.","Each of us has heaven and hell in him.","America had often been discovered before Columbus, but it had always been hushed up.","Romance should never begin with sentiment. It should begin with science and end with a settlement.","The condition of perfection is idleness: the aim of perfection is youth.","The public have an insatiable curiosity to know everything, except what is worth knowing.","I am sorry my life is so marred and maimed by extravagance. But I cannot live otherwise. I, at any rate, pay the penalty of suffering.","The critic has to educate the public; the artist has to educate the critic.","Discontent is the first step in the progress of a man or a nation.","I have said to you to speak the truth is a painful thing. To be forced to tell lies is much worse.","The only excuse for making a useless thing is that one admires it intensely. All art is quite useless.","The tragedy of the poor is that they can afford nothing but self denial.","Literature always anticipates life. It doesn\'t copy it but moulds it to it\'s purpose.","The way of paradoxes is the way of truth. To test Reality we must see it on the tight-rope.","The moon in her chariot of pearl","Things are because we see them, and what we see, and how we see it, depends on the Arts that influenced us. To look at a thing is very different from seeing a thing. One does not see anything until one sees its beauty. Then, and then only, does it comes into existence.","If a friend of mine gave a feast, and did not invite me to it, I should not mind a bit. But if a friend of mine had a sorrow and refused to allow me to share it, I should feel it most bitterly.","Few parents nowadays pay any regard to what their children say to them. The old fashioned respect for the young is fast dying out.","People say sometimes that Beauty is superficial. That may be so. But at least it is not so superficial as Thought is. To me, Beauty is the wonder of wonders. It is only shallow people who do not judge by appearances. The true mystery of the world is the visible, not the invisible.","Only the unimaginative can fail to find a reason for drinking Champagne","If one could only teach the English how to talk, and the Irish how to listen, society here would be quite civilized.","I did not think I should be ever loved: do you indeed Love me so much as now you say you do? Ask of the sea-bird if it loves the sea, Ask of the roses if they love the rain, Ask of the little lark, that will not sing Till day break, if it loves to see the day: And yet, these are but empty images, Mere shadows of my love, which is a fire So great that all the waters of the main Can not avail to quench it.","When you really want love you will find it waiting for you.","Sometime you will find, even as I have found, that there is no such thing as romantic experience; there are romantic memories, and there is the desire of romance- that is all.

I was quite right in saying you were a Bunburyist. You are one of the most advanced Bunburyists I know.","Friendship never forgets. That is the wonderful thing about it.","One should always play fairly when one has the winning cards.","Christ did not die to save people, but to teach people how to save each other. This is, I have no doubt, a grave heresy, but it is also a fact.","I wonder who it was defined man as a rational animal. It was the most premature definition ever given. Man is many things, but he is not rational.","Women represent the triumph of matter over mind, just as men represent the triumph of mind over morals.","One must have some sort of occupation nowadays. If I hadn\'t my debts I shouldn\'t have anything to think about.","We live, I regret to say, in an age of Big Data hype.","The first duty in life is to be as artificial as possible.  What the second duty is no one has as yet discovered.","Art finds her own perfection within, and not outside of, herself.

We are complex. Life is simple, and the simple thing is the right thing.","Know thyself\' was written over the portal of the antique world. Over the portal of the new world, \'Be thyself\' shall be written.","I live in terror of not being misunderstood.","The artistic life is a long, lovely suicide.","The soul is a terrible reality. It can be bought and sold and bartered away.","It is because Humanity has never known where it was going that it has been able to find its way.","The best art is about individualism, free self-expression and realising a unique, imaginative perspective- A true artist takes no notice whatever of the public. The public are to him non-existent.","I love hearing my relations abused. It is the only thing that makes me put up with them at all. Relations are simply a tedious pack of people, who haven\'t got the remotest knowledge of how to live nor the smallest instinct about when to die.","A gentleman never offends unintentionally","Good taste is the excuse I\'ve always given for leading such a bad life","Nothing is so aggravating than calmness.","Humanity takes itself too seriously.

Destiny does not send us heralds. She is too wise or too cruel for that.","Agitators are a set of interfering, meddling people, who come down to some perfectly contented class of the community and sow the seeds of discontent amongst them. That is the reason why agitators are so absolutely necessary. Without them, in our incomplete state, there would be no advance towards civilization.","To lose one parent may be regarded as a misfortune; to lose both looks like carelessness.","Romance should never begin with sentiment. It should begin with science and end with a settlement. Nothing spoils romance so much as a sense of humor in the woman. When one is in love one always begins by deceiving oneself, and one always ends by deceiving others. This is what the world calls a romance.","Music is the art... which most completely realizes the artistic idea and is the condition to which all the other arts are constantly aspiring.","He must have a truly romantic nature, for he weeps when there is nothing at all to weep about.","I treated Art as the supreme reality and life as a mere mode of fiction.","To be in love is to surpass one\'s self.","Let me be surrounded by luxury, I can do without the necessities!","Never regret thy fall, O Icarus of the fearless flight For the greatest tragedy of them all Is never to feel the burning light.","My wallpaper and I are fighting a duel to the death.

Moral people, as they are termed, are simple beasts.","When we are happy, we are always good, but when we are good, we are not always happy.","Nothing is good in moderation. You cannot know good in anything until you have torn the heart out of it by excess.","Be happy, be happy; you shall have your red rose. I will build it out of music by moonlight, and stain it with my own heart\'s-blood. All that I ask of you in return is that you will be a true lover, for Love is wiser than Philosophy, though she is wise, and mightier than Power, though he is mighty.","Pessimist: One who, when he has the choice of two evils, chooses both.","If Nature had been comfortable, mankind would never have invented architecture.","Beauty is the only thing that time cannot harm. Philosophies fall away like sand, and creeds follow one another like the withered leaves of Autumn; but what is beautiful is a joy for all seasons and a possession for all eternity.","Life is the art of being well deceived, and to succeed, it must be habitual and uninterrupted.","Behind the perfection of a man\'s style, must lie the passion of a man\'s soul.","Time is a waste of money.","To make a good salad is to be a brilliant diplomatist - the problem is entirely the same in both cases. To know exactly how much oil one must put with one\'s vinegar.","The birds that were singing in the dew-drenched garden seemed to be telling the flowers about her.","Music is the art which is most nigh to tears and memories.","Rugby is a game for barbarians played by gentlemen.

It is that I have put my genius into my life...I have put only my talent into my works.","Philanthropy [has become] simply the refuge of people who wish to annoy their fellow creatures.","Experience is a question of instinct about life.","The great things in life are what they seem to be. And for that reason, strange as it may sound to you, often are very difficult to interpret (understand). Great passions are for the great of souls. Great events can only be seen by people who are on a level with them. We think we can have our visions for nothing. We cannot. Even the finest and most self-sacrificing visions have to be paid for. Strangely enough, that is what makes them fine.","But we never get back our youth\u2026 The pulse of joy that beats in us at twenty becomes sluggish. Our limbs fail, our senses rot. We degenerate into hideous puppets, haunted by the memory of the passions of which we were too much afraid, and the exquisite temptations that we had not the courage to yield to.","Questions are never indiscreet, answers sometimes are.","A man is called affected, nowadays, if he dresses as he likes to dress. But in doing that he is acting in a perfectly natural manner. Affectation, in such matters, consists in dressing according to the views of one\'s neighbour, whose views, as they are the views of the majority, will probably be extremely stupid.","Thinking is the most unhealthy thing in the world, and people die of it just as they die of any other disease. Fortunately, in England at any rate, thought is not catching.","What seems to us as bitter trials are often blessings in disguise [in the future. But only if we set out to make this true and anticipate it so we look for the blessings until we find them].","The things one feels absolutely certain about are never true. That is the fatality of faith, and the lesson of romance.","Believe me, no civilized man ever regrets a pleasure, and no uncivilized man ever knows what a pleasure is.","Extravagance is the luxury of the poor; penury is the luxury of the rich.","Perhaps, after all, America never has been discovered. I myself would say that it had merely been detected.","She is very clever, too clever for a woman. She lacks the indefinable charm of weakness.","And all the woods are alive with the murmur and sound of Spring,\\n And the rose-bud breaks into pink on the climbing briar,\\n And the crocus-bed is a quivering moon of fire\\n Girdled round with the belt of an amethyst ring.","My desire to live is as intense as ever, and though my heart is broken, hearts are made to be broken: that is why God sends sorrow into the world.","Love is not fashionable anymore; the poets have killed it.","A map of the world that does not include Utopia is not worth even glancing at, for it leaves out the one country at which Humanity is always landing. And when Humanity lands there, it looks out, and, seeing a better country, sets sail. Progress is the realisation of Utopias.","What of Art? -It is a malady. --Love? -An Illusion. --Religion? -The fashionable substitute for Belief. --You are a sceptic. -Never! Scepticism is the beginning of Faith. --What are you? -To define is to limit.","If I am occasionally a little over-dressed, I make up for it by being always immensely over-educated.","I must remember that a good friend is a new world.","True friends stab you in the front.","Love is fed by the imagination, by which we become wiser than we know, better than we feel, nobler than we are: by which we can see life as a whole, by which and by which alone we can understand others in their real and their ideal relation. Only what is fine, and finely conceived can feed love. But anything will feed hate.","A red rose is not selfish because it wants to be a red rose. It would be horribly selfish if it wanted all the other flowers in the garden to be both red and roses.","Do you really think it is weakness that yields to temptation? I tell you that there are terrible temptations which it requires strength, strength and courage to yield to.","You can\'t possibly ask me to go without having some dinner. It\'s absurd. I never go without my dinner. No one ever does, except vegetarians and people like that.","Every portrait that is painted with feeling is a portrait of the artist, not of the sitter.","Life! Life! Don\'t let us go to life for our fulfillment or our experience. It is a thing narrowed by circumstances, incoherent in its utterance, and without that fine correspondence of form and spirit which is the only thing that can satisfy the artistic","The honest ratepayer and his healthy family have no doubt often mocked at the dome-like forehead of the philosopher, and laughed over the strange perspective of the landscape that lies beneath him. If they really knew who he was, they would tremble. For Chuang Ts\u01d4 spent his life in preaching the great creed of Inaction, and in pointing out the uselessness of all things.","Diversity of opinion about a work of art shows that the work \\n is new, complex, and vital.","Her trust makes me faithful, her belief makes me good.","Love! What is love? It\'s nothing. It\'s just a word. It doesn\'t exist. Only pleasure is important.","It is a sad truth, but we have lost the faculty of giving lovely names to things.","Art persists, it timelessly continues.","The ugly can be beautiful. The pretty, never.","Conversation should touch everything, but should concentrate itself on nothing.","Yet each man kills the thing he loves By each let this be heard Some do it with a bitter look Some with a flattering word The coward does it with a kiss The brave man with a sword","There are moments, psychologists tell us, when the passion for sin, or what the world calls sin, so dominates a nature, that every fibre of the body, as every cell of the brain, seems to be instinct with fearful impulses. Men and women at such moments lose the freedom of their will. They move to their terrible end as automatons move. Choice is taken from them, and conscience is either killed, or, if it lives at all, lives but to give rebellion its fascination, and disobedience its charm.","I tremble with pleasure when I think that on the very day of my leaving prison both the laburnum and the lilac will be blooming in the gardens, and that I shall see the wind stir into restless beauty the swaying gold of the one, and make the other toss the pale purple of its plumes, so that all the air shall be Arabia for me.","What consoles one nowadays is not repentance but pleasure. Repentance is quite out of date.","I am very glad I have travelled. Travel improves the mind wonderfully, and does away with all one\'s prejudices.","In America the President reigns for four years, and Journalism governs forever and ever.","Nothing spoils romance so much as a sense of humor in the woman","It is a sad thing to think of, but there is no doubt that genius lasts longer than beauty. That accounts for the fact that we all take such pains to over-educate ourselves. In the wild struggle for existence, we want to have something that endures, and so we fill our minds with rubbish and facts, in the silly hope of keeping our place. The thoroughly well-informed man--that is the modern ideal. And the mind of the thoroughly well-informed man is a dreadful thing. It is like a bric-a-brac shop, all monsters and dust, with everything priced above its proper value.","It is only the intellectually lost who ever argue.","The work of art is to dominate the spectator: the spectator is not to dominate the work of art.","Schools should be the most beautiful place in every town and village-so beautiful that the punishment for undutiful children should be barred from going to school the following day.","To disagree with three-fourths of the British public is one of the first requisites of sanity.","Every impulse we strangle will only poison us.","I\'ll bet you anything you like that half an hour after they have met, they will be calling each other sister. Women only do that when they have called each other a lot of other things first.","No publisher should ever express an opinion of the value of what he publishes.  That is a matter entirely for the literary critic to decide.","Nothing can cure the soul but the senses, just as nothing can cure the senses but the soul.","You must have a cigarette. A cigarette is the perfect type of a perfect pleasure. It is exquisite, and it leaves one unsatisfied. What more can one want?","Every woman is wrong until she cries.","Memory is the diary that chronicles things that never have happened and couldn\'t possibly have happened.","To believe is very dull. To doubt is intensely engrossing. To be on the alert is to live, to be lulled into security is to die.","Wordsworth went to the Lakes, but he was never a lake poet. He found in stones the sermons he had already hidden there.","One can always be kind to people about whom one cares nothing.","When one is in love, one always begins by deceiving one\'s self, and one always ends by deceiving others. That is what the world calls a romance.","When our eyes met, I felt that I was growing pale. A curious sensation of terror came over me. I knew that I had come face to face with some one whose mere personality was so fascinating that, if I allowed it to do so, it would absorb my whole nature, my whole soul, my very art itself.","You have filled my tea with lumps of sugar, and though I asked most distinctly for bread and butter, you have given me cake. I am known for the gentleness of my disposition, and the extraordinary sweetness of my nature, but I warn you, Miss Cardew, you may go too far.","More than half of modern culture depends upon what one shouldn\'t read.","When one pays a visit it is for the purpose of wasting other people\'s time, not one\'s own.","I don\u2019t write this letter to put bitterness into your heart, but to pluck it out of mine. For my own sake I must forgive you.","Pleasure is Nature\'s test, her sign of approval. When man is happy, he is in harmony with himself and his environment.","He lives the poetry that he cannot write. The others write the poetry that they dare not realize","Love does not traffic in a marketplace, nor use a huckster\'s scales. Its joy, like the joy of the intellect, is to feel itself alive. The aim of Love is to love: no more, and no less. You were my enemy: such an enemy as no man ever had. I had given you all my life, and to gratify the lowest and most contemptible of all human passions, hatred and vanity and greed, you had thrown it away. In less than three years you had entirely ruined me in every point of view. For my own sake there was nothing for me to do but to love you.","[T]he recognition of private property has really harmed Individualism, and obscured it, by confusing a man with what he possesses. It has led Individualism entirely astray. It has made gain, not growth its aim. So that man thought that the important thing is to have, and did not know that the important thing is to be.","It\'s an odd thing, but anyone who disappears is said to be seen in San Francisco. It must be a delightful city and possess all the attractions of the next world","I regard the theatre as the greatest of all art forms, the most immediate way in which a human being can share with another the sense of what it is to be a human being.","What art seeks to disturb is monotony of type, slavery of custom, tyranny of habit, and the reduction of man to the level of a machine.","sorrow...is a wound that bleeds when any hand but that of love touches it","Do not forget that small daily actions do or undo character.","If there was less sympathy in the world, there would be less trouble in the world.","Nothing, indeed, is more dangerous to the young artist than any \\n conception of ideal beauty: he is constantly led by it either into \\n weak prettiness or lifeless abstraction: whereas to touch the \\n ideal at all you must not strip it of vitality. You must find it in life and re-create it in art.","Nobody of any real culture, for instance, ever talks nowadays about the beauty of sunset. Sunsets are quite old fashioned. To admire them is a distinct sign of provincialism of temperament. Upon the other hand they go on.","I never change, except in my affections.","Fashion is what one wears oneself. What is unfashionable is what other people wear.","What is a cynic? A man who knows the price of everything and the value of nothing. And a sentimentalist, my dear Darlington, is a man who sees an absurd value in everything, and doesn\'t know the market place of any single thing.","Good resolutions are simply checks that men draw on a bank where they have no account.","To me, Beauty is the wonder of wonders...It is only shallow people who do not judge by appearances.","Rugby is a good occasion for keeping thirty bullies far from the center of the city.","I can\'t help detesting my relations. I suppose it comes from the fact that none of us can stand other people having the same faults as ourselves.","If one doesn\'t talk about a thing, it has never happened. It is simply expression that gives reality to things.","Suffering is one very long moment. We cannot divide it by seasons.","All art is immortal. For emotion for the sake of emotion is the aim of art, and emotion for the sake of action is the aim of life.","It is only the modern that ever becomes old-fashioned.","Football is all very well as a game for rough girls, but is hardly suitable for delicate boys.","People are very fond of giving away what they need most themselves. It is what I call the depth of generosity.","I now see that sorrow, being the supreme emotion of which man is capable, is at once the type and test of all great art.","Technique is really personality. That is the reason why the artist cannot teach it, why the pupil cannot learn it, and why the aesthetic critic can understand it. To the great poet, there is only one method of music - his own. To the great painter, there is only one manner of painting - that which he himself employs. The aesthetic critic, and the aesthetic critic alone, can appreciate all forms and all modes. It is to him that Art makes her appeal.","Freedom, individualism and being yourself so long as you don\'t hurt another\'s physical person or property: The true artist is a man who believes absolutely in himself, because he is absolutely himself.","It is always worth while asking a question, though it is not always worth while answering one.","The burden of this world is too great for one man to bear, and the world\u2019s sorrow too heavy for one heart to suffer.","Give him a mask, and he will tell you the truth.","All art is at once surface and symbol. Those who go beneath the surface do so at their peril.","Plain women are always jealous of their husbands. Beautiful women never are. They are always so occupied with being jealous of other women\'s husbands.","The exquisite art of idleness, one of the most important things that any University can teach.","Pleasure is Nature\'s test, her sign of approval.","I made art a philosophy, and philosophy an art: I altered the minds of men, and the colour of things: I awoke the imagination of my century so that it created myth and legend around me: I summed up all things in a phrase, all existence in an epigram: whatever I touched I made beautiful","Only people who look dull ever get into the House of Commons, and only people who are dull ever succeed there.","Travel ennobles the spirit and does away with our prejudices.","There is one thing worse than an absolutely loveless marriage: a marriage in which there is love, but on one side only.","Selfishness is not living as one wishes to live, it is asking others to live as one wishes to live.","The worst vice of the fanatic is his sincerity.","If one tells the truth, one is sure, sooner or later, to be found out.","There is always something ridiculous about the emotions of people whom one has ceased to love.","Misfortunes one can endure--they come from outside, they are accidents. But to suffer for one\'s own faults--ah!--there is the sting of life.","Only dull people are brilliant at breakfast.","One should either be a work of art, or wear a work of art.","Experience is merely the name men gave to their mistakes.","He was always late on principle, his principle being that punctuality is the thief of time.","The mere mechanical technique of acting can be taught, but the spirit that is to give life to lifeless forms must be born in a man. No dramatic college can teach its pupils to think or to feel. It is Nature who makes our artists for us, though it may be Art who taught them their right mode of expression.","Anybody can have common sense, provided that they have no imagination.","Ethics, like natural selection, make existence possible. Aesthetics, like sensual selection, make life lovely and wonderful, fill it with new forms, and give it progress, and variety and change.","I have always been of opinion that a man who desires to get married should know either everything or nothing.","There are times when sorrow seems to me to be the only truth.","One should never trust a woman who tells one her real age. A woman who would tell one that would tell one anything.","The youth of the present day are quite monstrous. They have absolutely no respect for dyed hair.","They are always asking a writer why he does not write like somebody else, or a painter why he does not paint like somebody else, quite oblivious of the fact that if either of them did anything of the kind he would cease to be an artist.","How marriage ruins a man! It is as demoralizing as cigarettes, and far more expensive.","Progress is the realization of utopia.","There is a fatality about good resolutions \u2013 that they are always made too late","Science is out of the reach of morals, for her eyes are fixed upon eternal truths. Art is out of the reach of morals, for her eyes are fixed upon things beautiful and immortal and ever-changing.","every portrait that is painted with feeling is a portrait of the artist, not of the sitter. The sitter is merely the accident, the occasion. It is not he who is revealed by the painter; it is rather the painter who, on the coloured canvas, reveals himself.","By giving us the opinions of the uneducated, journalism keeps us in touch with the ignorance of the community.","It would leave no room for developments and I intend to develop in many directions.","She lives the poetry she cannot write.","In fact, I am never wrong.","Thirty-five is a very attractive age. London society is full of women of the very highest birth who have, of their own free choice, remained thirty-five for years.","There is no mode of action, no form of emotion, that we do not share with the lower animals. It is only by language that we rise above them.","Each class preaches the importance of those virtues it need not exercise. The rich harp on the value of thrift, the idle grow eloquent over the dignity of labor.","There is no feeling more comforting and consoling than knowing you are right next to the one you love.","Spontaneity is a meticulously prepared art","Every great man nowadays has his disciples, and it is usually Judas who writes the biography.","He wants to enslave you.\' \'I shudder at the thought of being free.","All authority is quite degrading. It degrades those who exercise it, and it degrades those over whom it is exercised.","One is not always happy when one is good; but one is always good when one is happy.","Life has been your art. You have set yourself to music. Your days are your sonnets.","Twenty years of romance makes a woman look like a ruin; but twenty years of marriage makes her something like a public building.","Other people are quite dreadful. The only possible society is oneself.","Oh! it is absurd to have a hard-and-fast rule about what one should read and what one shouldn\'t. More than half of modern culture depends on what one shouldn\'t read.","It is only an auctioneer who can equally and impartially admire all schools of art.","When a man has once loved a woman he will do anything for her except continue to love her.","Laughter is not at all a bad beginning for a friendship, and it is far the best ending for one.","I think you are wrong, Basil, but I won\'t argue with you. It is only the intellectually lost who ever argue.","The one charm of marriage is that it makes a life of deception absolutely necessary for both parties.","It was not intended as a compliment. It was a confession. Now that I have made it, something seems to have gone out of me. Perhaps one should never put one\'s worship into words.","His sudden mad love for Sibyl Vane was a psychological phenomenon of no small interest. There was no doubt that curiosity had much to do with it, curiosity and the desire for new experiences; yet it was not a simple but rather a very complex passion.","Niagara Falls is simply a vast unnecessary amount of water going over the wrong way and then falling over unnecessary cliffs...The wonder would be if the water did not fall.","Words! Mere words! How terrible they were! How clear, and vivid, and cruel! One could not escape from them. And yet what a subtle magic there was in them! They seemed to be able to give a plastic form to formless things, and to have a music of their own as sweet as that of viol or of lute. Mere words! Was there anything so real as words?","There is nothing in the world like the devotion of a married woman. It is a thing no married man knows anything about.","Walt Whitman and Emerson are the poets who have given the world more than anyone else. Perhaps Whitman is not so widely read in England, but England never appreciates a poet until he is dead.","There is a luxury in self-reproach. When we blame ourselves we feel no one else has a right to blame us.","There were opium-dens, where one could buy oblivion, dens of horror where the memory of old sins could be destroyed by the madness of sins that were new.","Salom\xe9, Salom\xe9, dance for me. I pray thee dance for me. I am sad to-night. Yes, I am passing sad to-night. When I came hither I slipped in blood, which is an evil omen; and I heard, I am sure I heard in the air a beating of wings, a beating of giant wings. I cannot tell what they mean .... I am sad to-night. Therefore dance for me. Dance for me, Salom\xe9, I beseech you. If you dance for me you may ask of me what you will, and I will give it you, even unto the half of my kingdom.","If you want to be a doormat you have to lay yourself down first.","A grapefruit is just a lemon that saw an opportunity and took advantage of it.","When I like people immensely I never tell their names to anyone. It is like surrendering a part of them. I have grown to love secrecy.","Philanthropic people lose all sense of humanity. It is their distinguishing characteristic.","I love scandals about other people, but scandals about myself don\u2019t interest me. They have not got the charm of novelty.","Actual life was chaos, but there was something terribly logical in the imagination. It was the imagination that set remorse to dog the feet of sin. It was the imagination that made each crime bear its misshapen brood. In the common world of fact the wicked were not punished, nor the good rewarded. Success was given to the strong, failure thrust upon the weak. That was all.","It is a sad truth, but we have lost the faculty of giving lovely names to things. Names are everything. I never quarrel with actions. My one quarrel is with words. The man who could call a spade a spade should be compelled to use one. It is the only thing he is fit for.","An acquaintance that begins with a compliment is sure to develop into a real friendship.","Truth in art is the unity of a thing with itself: the outward rendered expressive of the inward: the soul made incarnate: the body instinct with spirit. For this reason there is no truth comparable to sorrow.","I have pleasures, and passions, but the joy of life is gone. I am going under: the morgue yawns for me. I go and look at my zinc-bed there. After all, I had a wonderful life, which is, I fear, over.","There is no such thing as a heterosexual male, only men who haven\'t met Oscar Wilde yet.","It is not wise to find symbols in everything that one sees. It makes life too full of terrors.","Life is far too important a thing ever to talk seriously about.","This suspense is terrible. I hope it will last.","Life imitates art far more than art imitates Life.","All the spring may be hidden in the single bud, and the low ground nest of the lark may hold the joy that is to herald the feet of many rose-red dawns.","I write because it gives me the greatest possible artistic pleasure to write. If my work pleases the few I am gratified. As for the mob, I have no desire to be a popular novelist. It is far too easy.","I really don\'t see anything romantic in proposing. It is very romantic to be in love. But there is nothing romantic about a definite proposal. Why, one may be accepted. One usually is, I believe. Then the excitement is all over. The very essence of romance is uncertainty. If ever I get married, I\'ll certainly try to forget the fact.","The bureaucracy is expanding to meet the needs of the expanding bureaucracy.","Find expression for a sorrow, and it will become dear to you. Find expression for a joy, and you will intensify its ecstasy.","Actors are so fortunate. They can choose whether they will appear in tragedy or in comedy, whether they will suffer or make merry, laugh or shed tears. But in real life it is different. Most men and women are forced to perform parts for which they have no qualifications. Our Guildensterns play Hamlet for us, and our Hamlets have to jest like Prince Hal. The world is a stage, but the play is badly cast.","The world has grown suspicious of anything that looks like a happy married life.","Bad artists always admire each other\'s work. They call it being large-minded and free from prejudice. But a truly great artist cannot conceive of life being shown, or beauty fashioned, under any conditions other than those he has selected.","If you want to be witty, say what you think at all times","One should never listen. To listen is a sign of indifference to one\'s hearers.","The artist is the creator of beautiful things. To reveal art and conceal the artist is art\'s aim.","Beauty is a form of Genius--is higher, indeed, than Genius, as it needs no explanation. It is one of the great facts of the world, like sunlight, or springtime, or the reflection in the dark waters of that silver shell we call the moon. It cannot be questioned. It has divine right of sovereignty. It makes princes of those who have it.","It was only in the theatre that I lived","The gods have been good to you. But what the gods give they quickly take away. You have only a few years in which to live really, perfectly, and fully. When your youth goes, your beauty will go with it, and then you will suddenly discover that there are no triumphs left for you, or have to content yourself with those mean triumphs that the memory of your past will make more bitter than defeats. Every month as it wanes bring you nearer to something dreadful. Time is jealous of you, and wars against your lilies and your roses.","I always like to know everything about my new friends, and nothing about my old ones.","All women become like their mothers. That is their tragedy. No man does. That\'s his.","In the old times men carried out their rights for themselves as they lived, but nowadays every baby seems born with a social manifesto in its mouth much bigger than itself.","Those who are faithful know only the trivial side of love: it is the faithless who know love\'s tragedies.","The stage is not merely the meeting place of all the arts, but is also the return of art to life.","It is exactly because a man cannot do a thing that he is a proper judge of it","The vilest deeds like poison weeds  Bloom well in prison air; It is only what is good in man  That wastes and withers there.","It is the confession, not the priest, that gives us absolution.","Create yourself. Be yourself your poem.","He rides in the row at ten o clock in the morning, goes to the Opera three times a week, changes his clothes at least five times a day, and dines out every night of the season. You don\'t call that leading an idle life, do you?","Women have become so highly educated... that nothing should surprise us nowadays, except happy marriages.","Never buy anything simply because it is expensive.","I love the French language... it\'s a delightful language, especially to curse with. It\'s like whopping your ass with silk.","And if it feels good... Feel it!","It\'s tragic how few people ever \'possess their souls\' before they die. \'Nothing is more rare in any man\', says Emerson, \'than an act of his own.\' It is quite true. Most people are other people. Their thoughts are someone else\'s opinions, their life is a mimicry, their passions a quotation.","When a man does exactly what a woman expects him to do she doesn\'t think much of him. One should always do what a woman doesn\'t expect, just as one should say what she doesn\'t understand.","Being natural is simply a pose, and the most irritating pose I know.","Modern pictures are, no doubt, delightful to look at. At least, some of them are. But they are quite impossible to live with; they are too clever, too assertive, too intellectual. Their meaning is too obvious, and their method too clearly defined. One","Would you be in any way offended if I said that you seem to me to be in every way the visible personification of absolute perfection?","but the bravest man among us is afraid of himself","The English public takes no interest in a work of art until it is told that the work in question is immoral.","Now it seems to me that love of some kind is the only possible explanation of the extraordinary amount of suffering that there is in the world.","He wanted to be where no one would know who he was. He wanted to escape from himself.","Every single work of art is the fulfillment of a prophecy; for every work of art is the conversion of an idea into an image.","When I think of all the harm [the Bible] has done, I despair of ever writing anything to equal it.","The problem with the common person is that he is so unbearably common!","But beauty, real beauty, ends where an intellectual expression begins. Intellect is in itself a mode of exaggeration, and destroys the harmony of any face.","To get into the best society, nowadays, one has either to feed people, amuse people, or shock people - that is all!","The artist is the creator of beautiful things. To reveal art and conceal the artist is art\'s aim. The critic is he who can translate into another manner or a new material his impression of beautiful things.","Sphinxes without secrets.","What is termed Sin is an essential element of progress. Without it the world would stagnate, or grow old, or become colorless. By its curiosity Sin increases the experience of the race. Through its intensified assertion of individualism it saves us from monotony of type. In its rejection of the current notions about morality, it is one with the higher ethics.","Unless one is wealthy there is no use in being a charming fellow. Romance is the privilege of the rich, not the profession of the unemployed. The poor should be practical and prosaic. It is better to have a permanent income than to be fascinating.","The fatal errors of life are not due to man\'s being unreasonable: an unreasonable moment may be one\'s finest moment. They are due to man\'s being logical.","Married men are horribly tedious when they are good husbands, and abominably conceited when they are not.","I hate people who are not serious about meals. It is so shallow of them.","A flower blossoms for its own joy.","I have grown tired of the articulate utterances of men and things. The Mystical in Art, the Mystical in Life, the Mystical in Nature this is what I am looking for. It is absolutely necessary for me to find it somewhere.","What men call the shadow of the body is not the shadow of the body, but is the body of the soul.","If there is anything more annoying in the world than having people talk about you, it is certainly having no one talk about you.","The tragedy of growing old is not that one is old but that one is young.","Always! That is a dreadful word. It makes me shudder when I hear it. Women are so fond of using it. They spoil every romance by trying to make it last forever. It is a meaningless word, too. The only difference between a caprice and a life-long passion is that the caprice lasts a little longer.","Women have a much better time than men in this world; there are far more things forbidden to them.","By persistently remaining single a man converts himself into a permanent public temptation.","The Book of Life begins with a man and a woman in a garden. It ends with Revelations.","To be natural is such a very difficult pose to keep up.","A man\'s very highest moment is, I have no doubt at all, when he kneels in the dust, and beats his breast, and tells all the sins of his life.","The liar at any rate recognizes that recreation, not instruction, is the aim of conversation, and is a far more civilized being than the blockhead who loudly expresses his disbelief in a story which is told simply for the amusement of the company.","Knowledge would be fatal. It is the uncertainty that charms one. A mist makes things wonderful.","Nothing makes one so vain as being told that one is a sinner.","I must say to myself that I ruined myself, and that nobody great or small can be ruined except by his own hand. I am quite ready to say so. ... Terrible as was what the world did to me, what I did to myself was far more terrible still.","The cities of America are inexpressibly tedious. The Bostonians take their learning too sadly; culture with them is an accomplishment rather than an atmosphere; their Hub, as they call it, is the paradise of prigs. Chicago is a sort of monster-shop, full of bustles and bores. Political life at Washington is like political life in a suburban vestry. Baltimore is amusing for a week, but Philadelphia is dreadfully provincial; and though one can dine in New York one could not dwell there.","It is only the sacred things that are worth touching","Whenever cannibals are on the brink of starvation, Heaven, in its infinite mercy, sends them a fat missionary.","The English country-gentleman galloping after a fox \u2014 the unspeakable in full pursuit of the uneatable.","To be really medi\xe6val one should have no body. To be really modern one should have no soul. To be really Greek one should have no clothes.","When asked what he thought of sports, Oscar Wilde replied, \\"I approve of any activity that requires the wearing of special clothing.","It is that deep spiritual affection that is as pure as it is perfect. It is beautiful, it is fine, it is the noblest form of affection. There is nothing unnatural about it.","Irony is wasted on the stupid","The security of Society lies in custom and unconscious instinct, and the basis of the stability of Society, as a healthy organism, is the complete absence of any intelligence amongst its members.","I sometimes think that God in creating man somewhat overestimated his ability.","Children begin by loving their parents; after a time they judge them; rarely, if ever, do they forgive them.","That very concentration of vision and intensity of purpose which is the characteristic of the artistic temperament is in itself a mode of limitation. To those who are preoccupied with the beauty of form nothing else seems of much importance.","A burnt child loves the fire.","A dreamer is one who can only find his way by moonlight, and his punishment is that he sees the dawn before the rest of the world.","We quaff the cup of life with eager haste without draining it, instead of which it only overflows the brim - objects press around us, filling the mind with the throng of desires that wait upon them, so that we have no room for the thoughts of death.","People sometimes inquire what form of government is most suitable for an artist to live under. To this question there is only one answer. The form of government that is most suitable to the artist is no government at all.","It is quite true that I have worshipped you with far more romance of feeling than a man usually gives to a friend. Somehow, I had never loved a woman. I suppose I never had time. Perhaps, as Harry says, a really grande passion is the privilege of those who have nothing to do, and that is the use of the idle classes in a country","It is always a silly thing to give advice, but to give good advice is absolutely fatal.","Tea is the only simple pleasure left to us.","There\'s no sin but stupidity.","If you are going to tell people the truth, you had better make them laugh or they will kill you.","The final mystery is oneself... Who can calculate the orbit of his own soul.","And what sort of lives do these people, who pose as being moral, lead themselves? My dear fellow, you forget that we are in the native land of the hypocrite.","I have grown to love secrecy. It seems to be the one thing that can make modern life mysterious or marvelous to us. The commonest thing is delightful if only one hides it.","I analyzed you, though you did not adore me.","It is only shallow people who require years to get rid of an emotion. A man who is master of himself can end a sorrow as easily as he can invent a pleasure. I don\'t want to be at the mercy of my emotions. I want to use them, to enjoy them, and to dominate them.","My dear young lady, there was a great deal of truth; I dare say, in what you said, and you looked very pretty while you said it, which is much more important.","Society takes upon itself the right to inflict appalling punishment on the individual, but it also has the supreme vice of shallowness, and fails to realize what it has done. When the man\'s punishment is over, it leaves him to himself; that is to say, it abandons him at the very moment when its highest duty towards him begins.","Just as the orator marks his good things by a dramatic pause, or by raising and lowering his voice, or by gesture, so the writer marks his epigrams with italics, setting the little gem, so to speak, like a jeweler.","It is art, and art only, that reveals us to ourselves.","More women grow old nowadays through the faithfulness of their admirers than through anything else.","Miss Prism: And you do not seem to realize, dear Doctor, that by persistently remaining single, a man converts himself into a permanent public temptation. Men should be more careful; this very celibacy leads weaker vessels astray. Chasuble: But is a man not equally attractive when married? Miss Prism: No married man is ever attractive except to his wife. Chasuble: And often, I\'ve been told, not even to her.","As long as a woman can look ten years younger than her own daughter, she is perfectly satisfied.","I was working on the proof of one of my poems all the morning, and took out a comma. In the afternoon I put it back again.","The only thing I can\'t resist is temptation.","Oh, I love London Society! It is entirely composed now of beautiful idiots and brilliant lunatics. Just what Society should be.","Poets know how useful passion is for publication. Nowadays a broken heart will run to many editions.","The one advantage of playing with fire...is\\nthat no one ever gets singed. It is the people who don\'t know how to play with it who get burned up.","Ah, on what little things does happiness depend! I have read all that the wise men have written, and all the secrets of philosophy are mine, yet for want of a red rose is my life made wretched.","I won\'t belong to a club that accepts me as a member","One of the many lessons that one learns in prison is, that things are what they are and will be what they will be.","Dammit Sir, it\'s your duty to get married. You can\'t always be living for pleasure!","I find it harder and harder every day to live up to my blue china.","In a temple everything should be serious except the thing that is being worshiped.","I feel that if I kept it secret it might grow in my mind (as poisonous things grow in the dark) and take its place with the other terrible thoughts that gnaw me","Conversation about the weather is the last refuge of the unimaginative.","The only artists I have ever known who are personally delightful are bad artists. Good artists exist simply in what they make, and consequently are perfectly uninteresting in what they are. A great poet, a really great poet, is the most unpoetical of all creatures. But inferior poets are absolutely fascinating. The worse their rhymes are, the more picturesque they look. The mere fact of having published a book of second-rate sonnets makes a man quite irresistible. He lives the poetry that he cannot write. The others write the poetry that they dare not realize.","Don\'t feed the trolls; nothing fuels them so much.","Youth is the only thing worth having.","Life is a nightmare that prevents one from sleeping.","There is nothing that art cannot express.","It is awfully hard work doing nothing. However, I don\'t mind hard work when there is no definite object of any kind. To do nothing at all is the most difficult thing.","All modes of government are failures. Despotism is unjust to everybody, including the despot, who was probably made for better things. Oligarchies are unjust to the many, and ochlocracies are unjust to the few. High hopes were once formed of democracy; but democracy means simply the bludgeoning of the people by the people for the people. It has been found out. I must say that it was high time, for all authority is quite degrading. It degrades those who exercise it, and degrades those over whom it is exercised.","Some temptations are so great it takes great courage to yield to them.","Life under a good government is rarely dramatic; life under a bad government is always so.","Im Krieg machen die Starken die Schwachen zu Sklaven, im Frieden machen die Reichen die Armen zu Sklaven.","The Lord\'s Prayer is 66 words, the Gettysburg Address is 286 words, there are 1.322 words in the Declaration of Independence, but government regulations on the sale of cabbage total 26.911 words. The difference between literature and journalism is that journalism is unreadable and literature is not read.","Experience was of no ethical value. It was merely the name men gave to their mistakes. Moralists had, as a rule, regarded it as a mode of warning, had claimed for it a certain ethical efficacy in the formation of character, had praised it as something that taught us what to follow and showed us what to avoid. But there was no motive power in experience. It was as little of an active cause as conscience itself. All that it really demonstrated was that our future would be the same as our past, and that the sin we had done once, and with loathing, we would do many times, and with joy.","One\'s past is what one is. It is the only way by which people should be judged.","The fact is, that civilization requires slaves. Human slavery is wrong, insecure, and demoralizing. On mechanical slavery, on the slavery of the machine, the future of the world depends.","Nothing annoys people so much as not receiving invitations.","It is a very sad thing that nowadays there is so little useless information.","A woman will flirt with anybody in the world as long as other people are looking on.","Flowers are as common in the country as people are in London.","To be premature is to be perfect","The man who can dominate a London dinner-table can dominate the world.","Alcohol, taken in sufficient quantities, may produce all the effects of drunkenness.","How else but through a broken heart may Lord Christ enter in?","When one has never heard a man\'s name in the course of one\'s life, it speaks volumes for him; he must be quite respectable.","All bad poetry springs from genuine feeling.","I can stand brute force, but brute reason is quite unbearable. There is something unfair about its use. It is hitting below the intellect.","Biography lends to death a new terror.","It is always the unreadable that occurs.","Paradoxically though it may seem, it is none the less true that life imitates art far more than art imitates life.","Youth! There is nothing like youth. The middle-aged are mortgaged to Life. The old are in Life\'s lumber-room. But youth is the Lord of Life. Youth has a kingdom waiting for it. Every one is born a king, and most people die in exile.","Bad art is a great deal worse than no art at all.","All trials are trials for one\'s life, just as all sentences are sentences of death.","An actor is part illusionist, part artist, part ham.","The dim roar of London was like the bourdon note of a distant organ","Sins of the flesh are nothing. They are maladies for physicians to cure, if they should be cured. Sins of the soul alone are shameful.","Oh, brothers! I don\'t care for brothers. My elder brother won\'t die, and my younger brothers seem never to do anything else.","This wallpaper is dreadful, one of us will have to go.","The world is changed because you are made of ivory and gold. The curves of your lips rewrite history.","Its a beautiful woman\'s fate to be the subject of conversation where ever she goes","There was so much in you that charmed me that I felt I must tell you something about yourself. I thought how tragic it would be if you were wasted.","The past could always be annihilated. Regret, denial, or forgetfulness could do that. But the future was inevitable.","Pray don\'t talk to me about the weather, Mr. Worthing. Whenever people talk to me about the weather, I always feel quite certain that they mean something else. And that makes me quite nervous.","Like dear St. Francis of Assisi I am wedded to Poverty: but in my case the marriage is not a success.","Marriage is the one subject on which all women agree and all men disagree.","The only sin is stupidity.","Nothing that actually occurs is of the smallest importance","I never read a book I must review; it prejudices you so.","Better the rule of One, whom all obey, than to let clamorous demagogues betray our freedom with the kiss of anarchy.","The camera, you know, will never capture you. Photography, in my experience, has the miraculous power of transferring wine into water.","I hope you have not been leading a double life, pretending to be wicked and being good all the time. That would be hypocrisy.","Suffering is one very long moment. We cannot divide it by seasons. We can only record its moods, and chronicle their return. With us time itself does not progress. It revolves. It seems to circle round one center of pain.","I am a born antinomian. I am one of those who are made for exceptions, not for laws. But while I see that there is nothing wrong in what one does, I see that there is something wrong in what one becomes.","And thus we rust Life\'s iron chain\\nDegraded and alone:\\nAnd some men curse, and some men weep,\\nAnd some men make no moan:\\nBut God\'s eternal Laws are kind\\nAnd break the heart of stone","While to the claims of charity a man may yield and yet be free, to the claims of conformity no man may yield and remain free at all.","Public Opinion... an attempt to organize the ignorance of the community, and to elevate it to the dignity of physical force.","No man should have a secret from his wife. She invariably finds it out.","Do you know that I am afraid that good people do a great deal of harm in this world? Certainly the greatest harm they do is that they make badness of such extraordinary importance.","And suddenly the moon withdraws her sickle from the lightening skies, and to her sombre cavern flies, wrapped in a veil of yellow gauze.","Even things that are true can be proved.","It is much more easy to have sympathy with suffering than it is to have sympathy with thought.","Philosophies fall away like sand, and creeds follow on another like the withered leaves of Autumn.","The gods are strange. It is not our vices only they make instruments to scourge us. They bring us to ruin through what in us is good, gentle, humane, loving.","Nothing worth knowing can be taught.","I think life too complex a thing to be settled by these hard and fast rules.","To be entirely free, and at the same time entirely dominated by law, is the eternal paradox of human life.","I wonder that no criminal has ever pleaded the ugliness of your city as an excuse for his crimes.","Those who find ugly meanings in beautiful things are corrupt without being charming. This is a fault.","There are works which wait, and which one does not understand for a long time; the reason is that they bring answers to questions which have not yet been raised; for the question often arrives a terribly long time after the answer.","Please do not shoot the pianist. He is doing his best.","If we\'re always guided by other people\'s thoughts, what\'s the point in having our own?","One should always eat muffins quite calmly. It is the only way to eat them.","Private information is practically the source of every large modern fortune.","The growing influence of women is the one reassuring thing in our political life.","I want to be good. I can\'t bear the idea of my soul being hideous.","Education is very admirable but let us not forget that anything worth knowing cannot be taught.","I tried to visit Albania but I couldn\'t find it on the map.","Don\'t run down dyed hair and painted faces. There is an extraordinary charm in them, sometimes.","I know not whether Laws be right, \\nOr whether Laws be wrong; \\nAll that we know who be in jail \\nIs that the wall is strong; \\nAnd that each day is like a year, \\nA year whose days are long.","Each man lived his own life and paid his own price for living it. The only pity was one had to pay so often for a single fault. One had to pay over and over again, indeed. In her dealings with man, Destiny never closed her accounts.","As for the virtuous poor, one can pity them, of course, but one cannot possibly admire them. They have made private terms with the enemy, and sold their birthright for very bad pottage. They must also be extraordinarily stupid.","The ancient historians gave us delightful fiction in the form of fact; the modern novelist presents us with dull facts under the guise of fiction.","We live in the age of the overworked and the undereducated.","Oh, I hate the cheap severity of abstract ethics!","Where your life leads you, you must go","The trouble with the lower classes is that they lack the sense of tragedy given to them by the upper classes.","I am happy in my prison of passion","Before Turner there was no fog in London.","The only beautiful things are the things that do not concern us.","The only thing in the world worse than being Oscar Wilde is not being Oscar Wilde.","When I am in trouble, eating is the only thing that consoles me. Indeed, as any one who knows me intimately will tell you, I refuse everything except food and drink. At the present moment I am eating muffins because I am unhappy. Besides, I am particularly fond of muffins.","Fashion is what one wears oneself. What is unfashionable is what other people wear. Just as vulgarity is simply the conduct of other people. And falsehoods the truths of other people. Other people are quite dreadful. The only possible society is oneself. To love oneself is the beginning of a life-long romance.","The mind of the thoroughly well-informed man is a dreadful thing. It is like a bric-\xe0-brac shop, all monsters and dust, with everything priced above its proper value.","Starvation, not sin, is the parent of modern crime.","There are only two kinds of women, the plain and the coloured.","Those who find beautiful meanings in beautiful things are the cultivated. For these there is hope. They are the elect to whom beautiful things mean only beauty.","The reason we are so pleased to find other people\'s secrets is that it distracts public attention from our own.","Everybody in American seems in a rush to catch a train.","However, I think anything is better than high intellectual pressure. That is the most unbecoming thing there is. It makes the noses of the young girls so particularly large.","The only real people are the people who never existed.","My philosophy? I\'m always right and you are wrong.","I suppose society is wonderfully delightful. To be in it is merely a bore. But to be out of it is simply a tragedy.","Lord AUGUSTUS:(looking around) Time to educate yourself, I suppose. DUMBY: No, time to forget all I have learned. That is much more important.","Good resolutions are useless attempts to interfere with scientific laws. Their origin is pure vanity. Their result is absolutely nil. They give us, now and then, some of those luxurious sterile emotions that have a certain charm for the weak.... They are simply cheques that men draw on a bank where they have no account.","It is not the prisoners who need reformation, it is the prisons.","If a man needs an elaborate tombstone in order to remain in the memory of his country, it is clear that his living at all was an act of absolute superfluity.","In the common world of fact the wicked were not punished, nor the good rewarded. Success was given to the strong, failure thrust upon the weak. That was all.","The ability of the theist to misunderstand a thing is directly proportional to the obviousness of the thing.","I like to do all the talking myself. It saves time, and prevents arguments.","A poet can survive everything but a misprint.","I am not at all cynical, I have merely got experience, which, however, is very much the same thing.","I can resist everything except temptation.","I forgot that every little action of the common day makes or unmakes character, and that therefore what one has done in the secret chamber one has some day to cry aloud on the house-tops.","To toil for a hard master is bitter, but to have no master to toil for is more bitter still.","Ah! The strength of women comes from the fact that psychology cannot explain us. Men can be analyzed, women...merely adored.","Philosophy teaches us to bear with equanimity the misfortunes of others.","Crying is the refuge of plain women but the ruin of pretty ones.","One\'s only real life is the life one never leads.","The man who sees both sides of a question is a man who sees absolutely nothing at all.","I have never met any really wicked person before. I feel rather frightened. I am so afraid he will look just like every one else.","My experience is that as soon as people are old enough to know better, they don\'t know anything at all.","There is only one class in the community that thinks more about money than the rich, and that is the poor. The poor can think of nothing else.","Man is a rational animal who always loses his temper when he is called upon to act in accordance with the dictates of reason.","There is no such thing as a moral or an immoral book. Books are well written, or badly written.","Music makes one feel so romantic - at least it always gets on one\'s nerves - which is the same thing nowadays.","I don\'t like compliments, and I don\'t see why a man should think he is pleasing a woman enormously when he says to her a whole heap of things that he doesn\'t mean.","Life cheats us with shadows. We ask it for pleasure. It gives it to us with bitterness and disappointment in its train.","When critics disagree the artist is in accord with himself.","The one charm of the past is that it is the past.","Truth, in matters of religion, is simply the opinion that has survived.","All great ideas are dangerous.","She is all the great heroines of the world in one. She is more than an individual. I love her, and I must make her love me. I want to make Romeo jealous. I want the dead lovers of the world to hear our laughter, and grow sad. I want a breath of our passion to stir dust into consciousness, to wake their ashes into pain.","It is personalities not principles that move the age.","The past is of no importance. The present is of no importance. It is with the future that we have to deal. For the past is what man should not have been. The present is what man ought not to be. The future is what artists are.","When liberty comes with hands dabbled in blood it is hard to shake hands with her.","With an evening coat and a white tie, anybody, even a stockbroker, can gain a reputation for being civilized","Examinations, sir, are pure humbug from beginning to end. If a man is a gentleman, he knows quite enough, and if he is not a gentleman, whatever he knows is bad for him.","The final mystery is oneself.","A well-tied tie is the first serious step in life.","The public has always, and in every age, been badly brought up. They are continually asking Art to be popular, to please their want of taste, to flatter their absurd vanity, to tell them what they have been told before, to show them what they ought to be tired of seeing, to amuse them when they feel heavy after eating too much, and to distract their thoughts when they are wearied of their own stupidity.","Most people are boring and stupid.","As for the virtuous poor, one can pity them of course, but one cannot possibly admire them.","If a woman wants to hold a man she has merely to appeal to what is worst in him.","The greatest of all sins is stupidity.","There is only one real tragedy in a woman\'s life. The fact that her past is always her lover, and her future invariably her husband.","I am the only person in the world I should like to know thoroughly.","It was a fatal day when the public discovered that the pen is mightier than the paving-stone, and can be made as offensive as the brickbat. They at once sought for the journalist, found him, developed him, and made him their industrious and well-paid servant. It is greatly to be regretted, for both their sakes.","By doing just a little every day, I can gradually let the task completely overwhelm me.","Disobedience is man\'s original virtue.","Prosperity, pleasure and success, may be rough of grain and common in fibre, but sorrow is the most sensitive of all created things. There is nothing that stirs in the whole world of thought to which sorrow does not vibrate in terrible and exquisite pulsation. The thin beaten-out leaf of tremulous gold that chronicles the direction of forces the eye cannot see is in comparison coarse. It is a wound that bleeds when any hand but that of love touches it, and even then must bleed again, though not in pain.","There are many things that we would throw away if we were not afraid that others might pick them up.","There can be nothing more frequent than an occasional drink.","A kiss may ruin a human life","I may have said the same thing before... but my explanation, I am sure, will always be different.","Nothing is so aggravating as calmness. There is something positively brutal about the good temper of most modern men.","Bigamy ? It\'s having one wife too much...\\n...Monogamy ?

The very sun and moon seem taken from us.","Medievalism, with its saints and martyrs, its love of self-torture, its wild passion for wounding itself, its gashing with knives, and its whipping with rods - Medievalism is real Christianity, and the medieval Christ is the real Christ.","To be good is to be in harmony with one\'s self.","My own business always bores me to death; I prefer other people\'s.","I don\'t play accurately--any one can play accurately--but I play with wonderful expression. As far as the piano is concerned, sentiment is my forte. I keep science for Life.","One\'s days were too brief to take the burden of another\'s errors on one\'s shoulders. Each man lived his own life and paid his own price for living it.","Ambition is the germ from which all growth of nobleness proceeds.","My dear Arthur, I never talk scandal. I only talk gossip. What is the difference between scandal and gossip? Oh! Gossip is charming! History is merely gossip. But scandal is gossip made tedious by morality.","At every single moment of one\'s life one is what one is going to be no less than what one has been.","It is love, and not German philosophy, that is the true explanation of the world, whatever may be the explanation of the next.","Is it thy will that I should wax and wane,\\nBarter my cloth of gold for hodden grey,\\nAnd at thy pleasure weave that web of pain\\nWhose brightest threads are each a wasted day?","Alas, I am dying beyond my means.","Anybody can make history; only a great man can write it.","There are few of us who have not sometimes wakened before dawn, either after one of those dreamless nights that make one almost enamoured of death, or one of those nights of horror and misshapen joy, when through the chambers of the brain sweep phantoms more terrible than reality itself, and instinct with that vivid life that lurks in all grotesques, and that lends to Gothic art its enduring vitality, this art being, one might fancy, especially the art of those whose minds have been troubled with the malady of reverie.","But then one regrets the loss even of one\'s worst habits. Perhaps one regrets them the most. They are such an essential part of one\'s personality.","Of course I have played outdoor games. I once played dominoes in an open air cafe in Paris.","The only thing worse than being misquoted is being sentenced to two years\' hard labour for buggery","And now, I am dying beyond my means. (Said while sipping champagne on his deathbed.)","I can believe anything provided it is quite incredible.","There were moments when he looked on evil simply as a mode through which he could realize his conception of the beautiful.","A really well-made buttonhole is the only link between Art and Nature.","Artists, like the Greek gods, are only revealed to one another.","One should not be too severe on English novels; they are the only relaxation of the intellectually unemployed.","Wisdom comes with winters","Do you really keep a diary? I\'d give anything to look at it. May I? Oh, no. You see, it is simply a very young girl\'s record of her own thoughts and impressions, and consequently meant for publication. When it appears in volume form I hope you will order a copy.","But she is happiest alone. She is happiest alone.","There is nothing so difficult to marry as a large nose.","We can forgive a man for making a useful thing as long as he does not admire it","She...can talk brillantly upon any subject provided she knows nothing about it.","There is a tiny yellow daffodil, The butterfly can see it from afar, Although one summer evening\'s dew could fill Its little cup twice over, ere the star Had called the lazy shepherd to his fold, And be no prodigal.","The truth is rarely pure and never simple. Modern life would be very tedious if it were either, and modern literature a complete impossibility!","If the poor only had profiles there would be no difficulty in solving the problem of poverty","Like all people who try to exhaust a subject, he exhausted his listeners.","I gave my genius to my life, but my talent to my art.","When I see a spade, I call it a spade. I\'m glad to say I have never seen a spade. The man who would call a spade a spade should be compelled to use it. It\'s the only thing he\'s fit for.","We have really everything in common with America nowadays, except, of course, language.","Every woman becomes their mother. That\'s their tragedy. And no man becomes his. That\'s his tragedy.","The truth about the life of a man is not what he does, but the legend which he creates around himself.","God and other artists are always a little obscure.","Make some sacrifice for your art and you will be repaid, but ask of art to sacrifice herself for you and a bitter disappointment may come to you.","A grand passion is the privelege of people who have nothing to do.","We have been able to have fine poetry in England because the public do not read it, and consequently do not influence it. The public like to insult poets because they are individual, but once they have insulted them, they leave them alone.","A subject that is beautiful in itself gives no suggestion to the artist.  It lacks imperfection.","Nothing is so dangerous as being too modern; one is apt to grow old fashioned quite suddenly.","The only thing that one really knows about human nature is that it changes. Change is the one quality we can predicate of it.  The systems that fail are those that rely on the permanency of human nature, and not on its growth and development.  The error of Louis XIV was that he thought human nature would always be the same.  The result of his error was the French Revolution.  It was an admirable result.","It is only through Art and through Art only that we can realize our perfection; Through Art and art only that we can shield ourselves from the sordid perils of actual existence.","The good ended happily, and the bad unhappily. That is what fiction means.","I am sick of women who love one. Women who hate one are much more interesting.","Your machinery is beautiful. Your society people have apologized to me for the envious ridicule with which your newspapers have referred to me. Your newspapers are comic but never amusing. Your Water Tower is a castellated monstrosity with pepperboxes stuck all over it. I am amazed that any people could so abuse Gothic art and make a structure not like a water tower but like a tower of a medieval castle. It should be torn down. It is a shame to spend so much money on buildings with such an unsatisfactory result. Your city looks positively dreary.","The wild Bee reels from bough to bough\\nWith his furry coat and his gauzy wing,\\nNow in a lily cup, and now\\nSetting a jacinth bell a-swing,\\nIn his wandering.","For, try as we may, we cannot get behind the appearence of things to reality. And the terrible reason may be that there is no reality in the things apart from their appearences.","When a man is old enough to do wrong he should be old enough to do right also.","The typewriting machine, when played with expression, is no more annoying than the piano when played by a sister or near relation.","While we look to the dramatist to give romance to realism, we ask of the actor to give realism to romance.","The amount of women in London who flirt with their own husbands is perfectly scandalous. It looks so bad. It is simply washing one\'s clean linen in public.","On an occasion of this kind it becomes more than a moral duty to speak one\'s mind. It becomes a pleasure.","There are moments when art attains almost to the dignity of manual labor.","The job of the critic is to report to us his moods.","There is no necessity to separate the monarch from the mob; all authority is equally bad.","He has no enemies, but he is intensely disliked by his friends.","The basis of optimism is sheer terror.","Actions are the first tragedy in life, words are the second. Words are perhaps the worst. Words are merciless. . .","Religions die when they are proved to be true. Science is the record of dead religions.","I never saw anybody take so long to dress, and with such little result.","The truth is never pure and rarely simple.","A glass of absinthe is as poetical as anything in the world. What difference is there between a glass of absinthe and a sunset?","To become a spectator of one\'s own life is to escape the suffering of life.","In the old days men had the rack. Now they have the Press.","Ordinary people waited till life disclosed to them its secrets, but to the few, to the elect, the mysteries of life were revealed before the veil was drawn away. Sometimes this was the effect of art, and chiefly of the art of literature, which dealt immediately with the passions and the intellect.","Books are never finished, They are merely abandoned.","The man who says he has exhausted life generally means that life has exhausted him.","The history of women is the history of the worst form of tyranny the world has ever known. The tyranny of the weak over the strong. It is the only tyranny that lasts.","Death and vulgarity are the only two facts in the nineteenth century that one cannot explain away.","The proper basis for marriage is mutual misunderstanding. The happiness of a married man depends on the people he has not married. One should always be in love - that\'s the reason one should never marry.","I do not approve of anything that tampers with natural ignorance. Ignorance is like a delicate exotic fruit; touch it and the bloom is gone. The whole theory of modern education is radically unsound. Fortunately in England, at any rate, education produces no effect whatsoever. If it did, it would prove a serious danger to the upper classes, and probably lead to acts of violence in Grosvenor Square.","The ugly and stupid have the best of it in this world. They can sit at their ease and gape at the play. If they know nothing of victory, they are at least spared the knowledge of defeat. They live as we all should live-- undisturbed, indifferent, and without disquiet. They never bring ruin upon others, nor ever receive it from alien hands. Your rank and wealth, Henry; my brains, such as they are-- my art, whatever it may be worth; Dorian Gray\'s good looks-- we shall all suffer for what the gods have given us, suffer terribly.","As one reads history, not in the expurgated editions written for schoolboys and passmen, but in the original authorities of each time, one is absolutely sickened, not by the crimes that the wicked have committed, but by the punishments that the good have inflicted; and a community is infinitely more brutalised by the habitual employment of punishment than it is by the occasional occurrence of crime.","He is fairer than the morning star, and whiter than the moon. For his body I would give my soul, and for his love I would surrender heaven.","It is the stupid and the ugly who have the best of it in this world","There is more to be said for stupidity than people imagine.  Personally I have a great admiration for stupidity.  It is a sort of fellow-feeling, I suppose.","Whenever one has anything unpleasant to say, one should always be quite candid.","There is no man who is not, at each moment, what he has been and what he will be.","There are two ways of disliking poetry, one way is to dislike it, the other is to read Pope.","The world is made by the singer for the dreamer.","I expect I shall have to die beyond my means.","I put my talent in my work, I save my Genius for my life.","A woman\'s life revolves in curves of emotions. It is upon lines of intellect that a man\'s life progresses.","Man is many things, but he is not rational.","Poor? What does that matter? When poverty creeps in at the door, love flies in through the window.","To stake all one\'s life on a single moment, to risk everything on one throw, whether the stake be power or pleasure, I care not - there is no weakness in that.","A thing is not necessarily true because a man dies for it.","Life is one fool thing after another whereas love is two fool things after each other.","In matters of grave importance, style, not sincerity, is the vital thing.","Shallow sorrows and shallow loves live on. The loves and sorrows that are great are destroyed by their own plenitude.","I threw the pearl of my soul into a cup of wine. I went down the primrose path to the sound of flutes. I lived on honeycomb.","The worst thing to do with success, is to boast about it.","I like looking at geniuses and listening to beautiful people.","When I ask for a water cress sandwich, I do not mean a loaf with a field in the middle of it.","Marco Polo had seen the inhabitants of Zipangu place rose-colored pearls in the mouths of the dead. A sea-monster had been enamoured of the pearl that the diver brought to King Perozes, and had slain the thief, and mourned for seven moons over its loss.","From the point of view of literature Mr. Kipling is a genius who drops his aspirates. From the point of view of life, he is a reporter who knows vulgarity better than any one has ever known it.","I am tired of myself to-night. I should like to be somebody else.","If one hears bad music, it is one\'s duty to drown it by one\'s conversation.","The world is a stage, but the play is badly cast.","When good Americans die they go to Paris.","Anybody can be good in the country. There are no temptations there.","I don\'t like novels that end happily. They depress me so much","The youth of America is their oldest tradition. It has been going on now for three hundred years.","I have the kiss of Walt Whitman still on my lips","One can survive everything, nowadays, except death, and live down everything except a good reputation.","There is no Mystery so great as Misery.","Nothing worth learning can ever be taught","Fathers should be neither seen nor heard. That is the only proper basis for family life.","Who am I to tamper with a masterpiece?","I adore simple pleasures. They are the last refuge of the complex.","I knew nothing but shadows and I thought them to be real.","You can have your secret as long as I have your heart[.]","I am but too conscious of the fact that we are born in an age when only the dull are treated seriously, and I live in terror of not being misunderstood.","Life is terrible. It rules us, we do not rule it.","If one plays good music, people don\'t listen and if one plays bad music people don\'t talk.","I wanted to eat of the fruit of all the trees in the garden of the world\u2026 And so, indeed, I went out, and so I lived. My only mistake was that I confined myself so exclusively to the trees of what seemed to me the sun-lit side of the garden, and shunned the other side for its shadow and its gloom.","I usually say what I really think. A great mistake nowadays. It makes one so liable to be misunderstood.","It is only fair to state, with regard to modern journalists, that they always apologize to one in private for what they have written against one in public.","\\"I hope your hair curls naturally, does it?\\" \\"Yes, darling, with a little help from others.\\"","Nothing should be out of the reach of hope. Life is a hope.","Genius lasts longer than Beauty. That accounts for the fact that we all take such pains to over-educate ourselves.","Like two doomed ships that pass in storm we had crossed each other\'s way: but we made no sign, we said no word, we had no word to say.","We become lovers when we see Romeo and Juliet, and Hamlet makes us students. The blood of Duncan is upon our hands, with Timon werage against the world, and when Lear wanders out upon the heath the terror of madness touches us. Ours is the white sinlessness of Desdemona, and ours, also, the sin of Iago.","Each time that one loves is the only time one has ever loved.","No art ever survived censorship; no art ever will.","You can fake intelligence, but you can\'t fake wit.","You shut out from your society the gentle and the good. You laugh at the simple and the pure. living, as you all do, on other and by them, you need at self-sacrifice, and if you throw bread to the poor, it is merely to keep them quiet for a season.","The State is to make what is useful. The individual is to make what is beautiful.","Self-denial is the shining sore on the leprous body of Christianity.","When one is in town one amuses oneself. When one is in the country one amuses other people. It is excessively boring.","God, bless me with luxury. Necessities I can do without.","No crime is vulgar,\\nbut all vulgarity is crime.","To be good, according to the vulgar standard of goodness, is obviously quite easy.

It fills one with the terror of eternity.","Bad artists always admire each others work.","The happiness of a married man depends on the people he has not married.","I live constantly in the fear of not being misunderstood.","It is a vulgar error to suppose that America was ever discovered. It was merely detected.","Ah, on what little things does happiness depend.","I can stand brute force, but brute reason is quite unbearable.","Arguments are extremely vulgar, for everybody in good society holds exactly the same opinions.","Just because a man has died for it, does not make it true.","The only thing that one really knows about human nature is that it changes. Change is the one quality we can predicate of it.","He hadn\u2019t a single redeeming vice.","Life is not governed by will or intention. Life is a question of nerves, and fibres, and slowly built-up cells in which thought hides itself and passion has its dreams.","If people are dishonest once, they will be dishonest a second time. And honest people should keep away from them. (Lady Chiltern)","Even men of the noblest possible moral character are extremely susceptible to the influence of the physical charms of others. Modern, no less then Ancient History, supplies us with many most painful examples of what I refer to. If it were not so, indeed, History would be quite unreadable.","Romance lives by repetition, and repetition converts an appetite into an art. Besides, each time that one loves is the only time one has ever loved. Difference of object does not alter singleness of passion. It merely intensifies it. We can have in life but one great experience at best, and the secret of life is to reproduce that experience as often as possible.","I don\'t recognize you - I\'ve changed a lot.","As a wicked man I am a complete failure. Why, there are lots of people who say I have never really done anything wrong in the whole course of my life.

In the interest of the rich we must get rid of it.","Art is not to be taught in Academies. It is what one looks at, not what one listens to, that makes the artist.

They never have anything to say, but they say it charmingly","Temperament is the primary requisite for the critic - a temperament exquisitely susceptible to beauty, and to the various impressions that beauty gives us.","We spend our days, each one of us, in looking for the secret of life. Well, the secret of life is in Art.","I am afraid that woman appreciate cruelty, downright cruelty, more than anything else. They have wonderfully primitive instincts.

Experience was of no ethical value. It was merely the name men gave to their mistakes.","The trouble with women is, that when they grow up, they turn into their mothers. The trouble with men is, that they don\'t.","St. Paul\'s\\nLoomed like a bubble o\'er the town.","The real weakness of England lies, not in incomplete armaments or unfortified coasts, not in the poverty that creeps through sunless lanes, or the drunkenness that brawls in loathsome courts, but simply in the fact that her ideals are emotional and not intellectual.","The Americans are identical to the British in all respects except, of course, language.","Oh, how I vainly wished to the bearded man in the sky that I was Neapolitan. Why? So I could bring in a fine Neapolitan pest control to help with Queensberry\'s problem before it gets out of hand.","The best way to appreciate your job is to, is here to stay.","We have quite the same ideas. No; I think our ideas are quite different. But he has been most pleasant.","Tread Lightly, she is near Under the snow, Speak gently, she can hear The daisies grow.","No artist has ethical sympathies. An ethical sympathy in an artist is an unpardonable mannerism of style.","Though of all poses a moral pose is the most offensive, still to have a pose at all is something.","As long as war is regarded as wicked, it will always have its fascination. When it is looked upon as vulgar, it will cease to be popular.","The aim of life is self-development. To realize one\'s nature perfectly - that is what each of us is here for.","To give an accurate description of what has never occurred is not merely the proper occupation of the historian, but the inalienable privilege of any man of parts and culture.","I love scrapes. They are the only things that are never serious.\\" \\"Oh, that\'s nonsense, Algy. You never talk anything but nonsense.\\" \\"Nobody ever does.","I have invented an invaluable permanent invalid called Bunbury, in order that I may be able to go down into the country whenever I choose.","There was purification in punishment. Not \'Forgive us our sins,\' but \'Smite us for our iniquities\' should be the prayer of a man to a most just God.","But whether I become a believer or remain an agnostic, my belief or disbelief must derive its source from within, not from without. I, myself, must create its symbols. The transcendental is that which produces its own form. I will never discover its secret if I do not find it in my own heart; if I do not possess it already I shall never be able to acquire it.","Dear Prince, I must leave you, but I will never forget you, and next spring I will bring you back two beautiful jewels in place of those you have given away. The ruby shall be redder than a red rose, and the sapphire shall be as blue as the great sea.","I was wrong. God\'s law is only Love.","A man whose desire is to be something separate from himself, to be a member of Parliament, or a successful grocer, or a prominent solicitor, or a judge, or something equally tedious, invariably succeeds in being what he wants to be. That is his punishment. Those who want a mask have to wear it.","Each little thing that we do passes into the great machine of life which may grind our virtues to powder and make them worthless, or transform our sins into elements of a new civilization, more marvelous and more splendid than any that has gone before.","Nobody ever commits a crime without doing something stupid.","Bad manners make a journalist.","In a very ugly and sensible age, the arts borrow, not from life, but from each other.","Man is made for something better than disturbing dirt.","For us there is only one season, the season of sorrow. The very sun and moon seem taken from us. Outside, the day may be blue and gold, but the light that creeps down through the thickly-muffled glass of the small iron-barred window beneath which one sits is grey and niggard. It is always twilight in one\'s cell, as it is always twilight in one\'s heart. And in the sphere of thought, no less than in the sphere of time, motion is no more.","I never saw so many well-dressed, well-fed, business-looking Bohemians in my life.","There is no such thing as romance in our day, women have become too brilliant; nothing spoils a romance so much as a sense of humor in the woman.","I am thoroughly sick of pearls. They make one look so plain, so good and so intellectual.","The last person who ever crossed me is dead under my bed!!!","People are either charming or tedious.","What we have to do, what at any rate it is our duty to do, is to revive the old art of Lying.","Sin is a thing that writes itself across a man\'s face. It cannot be concealed.","I am sick to death of cleverness. Everybody is clever nowadays.","You have never been poor, and never known what ambition is.","No theory of life seemed to him to be of any importance compared with life itself","Sin is a thing that writes itself across a man\'s face. It cannot be concealed. People talk sometimes of secret vices, there are no such things. If a wretched man has a vice, it shows itself in the lines of his mouth, the droop of his eyelids, the moulding of his hands even.","Most of our modern portrait painters are doomed to absolute oblivion. They never paint what they see. They paint what the public sees, and the public never sees anything.","It is through art, and through art only, that we can realise our perfection.","No woman should ever be quite accurate about her age. It looks so calculating.","I hate vulgar realism in literature. The man who would call a spade a spade should be compelled to use one.","For life is terribly deficient in form. Its catastrophes happen in the wrong way and to the wrong people. There is a grotesque horror about its comedies, and its tragedies seem to culminate in farce.","America is the noisiest country that ever existed. One is waked up in the morning, not by the singing of the nightingale, but by the steam whistle.","Sympathy with joy intensifies the sum of sympathy in the world, sympathy with pain does not really diminish the amount of pain.","How does one cure the soul? Through the senses","I do not approve of anything which tampers with natural ignorance","Every one of course represents the spirit of his age, but there is an eternal aspect of the Spirit of every age which may be caught. To recreate the past from the mutilated fragments of the present is the task of the Historian.","Hard work is amply the refuge of those who have nothing to do.","To exercise power costs effort and demands courage. That is why so many fail to assert rights to which they are perfectly entitled - because a right is a kind of power but they are too lazy or too cowardly to exercise it. The virtues which cloak these faults are called patience and forbearance.","Yet, even for us, there is left some loveliness of environment, and the dullness of tutors and professors matters very little when one can loiter in the grey cloisters at Magdalen, and listen to some flute-like voice singing in Waynfleete\'s chapel, or lie in the green meadow, among the strange snakespotted fritillaries, and watch the sunburnt noon smite to a finer gold the tower\'s gilded vanes, or wander up the Christ Church staircase beneath the vaulted ceiling\'s shadowy fans, or pass through the sculptured gateway of Laud\'s building in the College of St. John.","The intellect is not a serious thing, and never has been. It is an instrument on which one plays, that is all.","A beautiful woman risking everything for a mad passion. A few wild weeks of happiness cut short by a hideous, treacherous crime. Months of voiceless agony, and then a child born in pain. The mother snatched away by death, the boy left to solitude and the tyranny of an old and loveless man. Yes, it was an interesting background. It posed the lad, made him more perfect as it were. Behind every exquisite thing that existed, there was something tragic.","Charity creates a multitude of sins.","He had that curious love of green, which in individuals is always the sign of a subtle artistic temperament, and in nations is said to denote a laxity, if not a decadence of morals.","Oh, he occasionally takes an alcoholiday.","Surely Love is a wonderful thing. It is more precious than emeralds, and dearer than fine opals. Pearls and pomegranates cannot buy it, nor is it set forth in the marketplace. It may not be purchased of the merchants, for can it be weighed out in the balance for gold.","Cultivated leisure is the aim of man.","Lean on principles, one day they\'ll end up giving way.","It is only the unimaginative who ever invents. The true artist is known by the use he makes of what he annexes.","Never so sweet a repast as the Reaper\'s when you tread upon the threshold of a Quiznos.","All art is at once surface and symbol. Those who go beneath the surface do so at their peril. Those who read the symbol do so at their peril. It is the spectator, and not life, that art really mirrors. Diversity of opinion about a work of art shows that the work is new, complex, and vital. When critics disagree, the artist is in accord with himself.","I love acting. It is so much more real than life.","London is full of women who trust their husbands. One can always recognize them. They look so thoroughly unhappy.","Imitation is the homage mediocrity pays to greatness.","All art is quite useless.","At twilight, nature is not without loveliness, though perhaps its chief use is to illustrate quotations from the poets.","Like strange mechanical grotesques,\\nMaking fantastic arabesques,\\nThe shadows raced across the blind.","The form of government that is most suitable to the artist is no government at all. Authority over him and his art is ridiculous.","George Moore leads his readers to the latrine and locks them in.","It is a great mistake for men to give up paying compliments, for when they give up saying what is charming, they give up thinking what is charming.","Through our sunless lanes creeps Poverty with her hungry eyes, and Sin with his sodden face follows close behind her.  Misery wakes us in the morning and Shame sits with us at night.","Art never expresses anything but itself.","Whenever people agree with me I always feel I must be wrong.","Why was I born with such contemporaries?","Books are well written, or badly written. That is all.","The studio was filled with the rich odour of roses, and when the light summer wind stirred amidst the trees of the garden, there came through the open door the heavy scent of the lilac, or the more delicate perfume of the pink-flowering thorn.","Fruitcake is like semen, there\'s a lot of it about but no one wants to swallow it","Do not be afraid of the past. If people tell you that it is irrevocable, do not believe them.","Any place you love is the world to you\u201d, explained the pensive Catherine Wheel, who had been attached to an old deal box in early life, and prided herself on her broken heart; \u201cbut love is not fashionable any more, the poets have killed it. They wrote so much about that nobody believed them, and I am not surprised. True love suffers, and is silent. I remember myself once- But it is no matter now. Romance is a thing of the past.","Women defend themselves by attacking, just as they attack by sudden and strange surrenders.","To speak frankly, I am not in favour of long engagements. They give people the opportunity of finding out each other\'s character before marriage, which I think is never advisable.","Many people become bankrupt through having invested too heavily in the prose of life. To have ruined one\'s self over poetry is an honor.","Caricature is the tribute which mediocrity pays to genius.","If we men married the women we deserved, we should have a very bad time of it.","I am too fond of reading books to care to write them.","A process which makes one rogue cleverer than another.","A book or poem which has no pity in it had better not be written.","Love is a sacrament that should be taken kneeling.","I am quite incapable of understanding how any work of art can be criticized from a moral standpoint. The sphere of art and the sphere of ethics are absolutely distinct and separate.","If God really wanted to punish, he\'d answer all our prayers.","I didn\'t have a life until I went up onstage.","Missionaries are going to reform the world whether it wants to or not.","When I was young, I was no one. Now, I\'m worldwilde.","Mothers, of course, are all right. They pay a chap\'s bills and don\'t bother him. But fathers bother a chap and never pay his bills.","The moment you think you understand a great work of art, it\'s dead for you.","His morality is all sympathy, just what morality should be","Just as the worst slave-owners were those who were kind to their slaves, and so prevented the horror of the system being realized by those who suffered from it, and understood by those who contemplated it, so, in the present state of things in England, the people who do most harm are the people who try to do most good.","It is a very dangerous thing to know one\u2019s friends.","The proper aim is to try and reconstruct society on such a basis that poverty will be impossible.","In all unimportant matters, style, not sincerity, is the essential. In all important matters, style, not sincerity, is the essential.","Then there was a man who said, \'I never knew what real happiness was until I got married; by then it was too late\'","Art creates an incomparable and unique effect, and, having done so, passes on to other things. Nature, upon the other hand, forgetting that that imitation can be made the sincerest form of insult, keeps on repeating this effect until we all become absolutely wearied of it.","M. Zola is determined to show that, if he has not got genius, he can at least be dull.","Gwendolen, it is a terrible thing for a man to find out suddenly that all his life he has been speaking nothing but the truth. Can you forgive me?","All thought is immoral. Its very essence is destruction. If you think of anything, you kill it. Nothing survives being thought of.","Yes, I am a thorough republican. No other form of government is so favorable to the growth of art. ...because of the importance it places on the individual, their liberty, self-expression, creativity, and personal responsibility.","I love hearing my relations abused. It is the only thing that makes me put up with them at all.","A work of art is the unique result of a unique temperament. Its beauty comes from the fact that the author is what he is. ...Art is the most intense mode of Individualism that the world has known. I am inclined to say that it is the only real mode of Individualism that the world has known. ...Art is Individualism.","The chin a little higher, dear. Style largely depends on the way the chin is worn. They are worn very high, just at present.","Great passions are for the great of soul, and great events can be seen only by those who are on a level with them","In the wild struggle for existence, we want to have something that endures, and so we fill our minds with rubbish and facts, in the silly hope of keeping our place.","My sweet rose, my delicate flower, my lily of lilies, it is perhaps in prison that I am going to test the power of love. I am going to see if I cannot make the bitter warders sweet by the intensity of the love I bear you. I have had moments when I thought it would be wise to separate. Ah! Moments of weakness and madness! Now I see that would have mutilated my life, ruined my art, broken the musical chords which make a perfect soul. Even covered with mud I shall praise you, from the deepest abysses I shall cry to you. In my solitude you will be with me.","I envy you going to Oxford: it is the most flower-like time of one\'s life. One sees the shadow of things in silver mirrors. Later on, one sees the Gorgon\'s head, and one suffers, because it does not turn one to stone.","That is what the highest criticism really is, the record of one\'s own soul. It is more fascinating than history, as it is concerned simply with oneself. It is more delightful than philosophy, as its subject is concrete and not abstract, real and not vague. It is the only civilized form of autobiography.","An artist should create beautiful things, but should put nothing of his own life into them.","I don\'t know how to talk. Oh! talk to every woman as if you loved her, and to every man as if he bored you, and at the end of your first season you will have the reputation of possessing the most perfect social tact.","So lets knock a couple back and make some noise","A temperament capable of receiving, through an imaginative medium, and under imaginative conditions, new and beautiful impressions, is the only temperament that can appreciate a work of art.","The only possible form of exercise is to talk, not to walk.","And certainly once a man begins to neglect his domestic duties he becomes painfully effeminate, does he not? And I don\'t like that. It makes men so very attractive.","You might see nothing in him. I see everything in him.","The girl never really lived, and so she has never really died.","The poet is the supreme artist, for he is the master of colour and of form, and the real musician besides, and is lord over all life and all arts.","Sin is the only real colour element left in modern life.","There are three kinds of despots. There is the despot who tyrannizes over the body. There is the despot who tyrannizes over the soul. There is the despot who tyrannizes over the soul and body alike. The first is called the Prince. The second is called the Pope. The third is called the People.","Men of thoughts should have nothing to do with action.","I have never admitted that I am more than twenty-nine, or thirty at the most. Twenty-nine when there are pink shades, thirty when there are not.","He watched it with that strange interest in trivial things that we try to develop when things of high import make us afraid, or when we are stirred by some new emotion for which we cannot find expression.","We are the zanies of sorrow. We are clowns whose hearts are broken.","When I had to fill in my immigration papers, I gave my age as 19, and my profession as genius; I added that I had nothing to declare except my talent.","One has a right to judge a man by the effect he has over his friends.","Scepticism is the beginning of Faith.","Ideals are dangerous things. Realities are better. They wound, but they\'re better.","To know anything about oneself one must know all about others.","There is much to be said in favor of modern journalism. By giving us the opinions of the uneducated, it keeps us in touch with the ignorance of the community. By carefully chronicling the current events of contemporary life, it shows us of what very little importance such events really are. By invariably discussing the unnecessary, it makes us understand what things are requisite for culture, and what are not.","The only way to atone for being occasionally overdressed is to be massively overeducated.","If it is not nailed to the floor, it\'s mine. If I can pry it loose, it is not nailed down.","Talk to a woman as if you loved her, and to a man as if he bored you.","We who live in prison, and in whose lives there is no event but sorrow, have to measure time by throbs of pain, and the record of bitter moments.","As one knows the poet by his fine music, so one can recognize the liar by his rich rhythmic utterance, and in neither case will the casual inspiration of the moment suffice. Here, as elsewhere, practice must precede perfection.","It often happens that the real tragedies of life occur in such an inartistic manner that they hurt us by their crude violence, their absolute incoherence, their absurd want of meaning, their entire lack of style.","He who stands most remote from his age is he who mirrors it best.","Perhaps there may come into my art also, no less than into my life, a still deeper note, one of greater unity of passion, and directness of impulse. Not width but intensity is the true aim of modern art. We are no longer in art concerned with the type. It is with the exception that we have to do. I cannot put my sufferings into any form they took, I need hardly say. Art only begins where Imitation ends, but something must come into my work, of fuller memory of words perhaps, of richer cadences, of more curious effects, of simpler architectural order, of some aesthetic quality at any rate.","She is a peacock in everything but beauty!","Poets are not so scrupulous as you are. They know how useful passion is for publication. Nowadays a broken heart will run to many editions.\\" \\"I hate them for it,\\" cried Hallward. \\"An artist should create beautiful things, but should put nothing of his own life into them. We live in an age when men treat art as if it were meant to be a form of autobiography. We have lost the abstract sense of beauty. Some day I will show the world what is it; and for that the world shall never see my portrait of Dorian Gray.","She was a curious woman, whose dresses always looked as if they had been designed in a rage and put on in a tempest. She was usually in love with somebody, and, as her passion was never returned, she had kept all her illusions. She tried to look picturesque, but only succeeded in being untidy.","The true critic is he who bears within himself the dreams and ideas and feelings of myriad generations, and to whom no form of thought is alien, no emotional impulse obscure.","He is really not so ugly after all, provided, of course, that one shuts one\'s eyes, and does not look at him.","It is he who has broken the bond of marriage - not I. I only break its bondage.","Conscience and cowardice are really the same things, Basil. Conscience is the trade-name of the firm. That is all.","Everyone should keep someone else\'s diary.","Well, I can\u2019t help going to see Sibyl play, even if it is only for an act. I get hungry for her presence; and when I think of the wonderful soul that is hidden away in that little ivory body, I am filled with awe.\\" \\"You can dine with me to-night, Dorian, can\u2019t you?\\" He shook his head. \\"To night she is Imogen,\\" he answered, \\"and tomorrow night she will be Juliet.\\" \\"When is she Sibyl Vane?\\" \\"Never.\\" \\"I congratulate you.","The great poet is always a seer, seeing less with the eyes of the body than he does with the eyes of the mind.","We think that we are generous because we credit our neighbor with those virtues that are likely to benefit ourselves. We praise the banker that we may overdraw our account, and find good qualities in the highwayman in the hope that he may spare our pockets.","The nineteenth century is a turning point in history, simply on account of the work of two men, Darwin and Renan, the one the critic of the Book of Nature, the other the critic of the books of God. Not to recognise this is to miss the meaning of one of the most important eras in the progress of the world.","George Moore wrote brilliant English until he discovered grammar.","\\"There is no such thing as a good influence, Mr. Gray. All influence is immoral \u2014 immoral from the scientific point of view.\\" \\"Why?\\" \\"Because to influence a person is to give him one\'s own soul.\\"","Men know life too early. Women know life too late. That is the difference between men and women.","Well, I know, of course, how important it is not to keep a business engagement, if one wants to retain any sense of the beauty of life.","I made art a philosophy, and philosophy an art.","Jack? . . . No, there is very little music in the name Jack, if any at all, indeed. It does not thrill. It produces absolutely no vibrations . . . I have known several Jacks, and they all, without exception, were more than usually plain. Besides, Jack is a notorious domesticity for John! And I pity any woman who is married to a man called John. She would probably never be allowed to know the entrancing pleasure of a single moment\u2019s solitude. The only really safe name is Ernest.","It is only the superficial qualities that last. Man\'s deeper nature is soon found out.","Personality must be accepted for what it is. You mustn\'t mind that a poet is a drunk, rather that drunks are not always poets.","Common sense is the enemy of Romance :P:P","The modern sympathy with invalids is morbid. Illness of any kind is hardly a thing to be encouraged in others.","Women, as some witty Frenchman once put it, inspire us with the desire to do masterpieces and always prevent us from carrying them out.","To get back one\'s youth one has merely to repeat one\'s follies.","I am not laughing, Dorian; at least I am not laughing at you. But you should not say the greatest romance of your life. You should say the first romance of your life. You will always be loved, and you will always be in love with love. A grande passion is the privilege of people who have nothing to do. That is the one use of the idle classes of a country. Don\'t be afraid. There are exquisite things in store for you. This is merely the beginning.","All sins, except a sin against itself, Love should forgive. All lives, save loveless lives, true Love should pardon.","Romantic literature is in effect imaginative lying.","I didn\'t say I liked it Harry. I said it fascinated me. There is a great difference.","Yes, very sensible... People die of common sense, Dorian, one lost moment at a time. Life is a moment. There is no hereafter. So make it burn always with the hardest flame.","It is well for his peace that the saint goes to his martyrdom. He is spared the sight of the horror of his harvest.","While one should always study the method of a great artist, one should never imitate his manner. The manner of an artist is essentially individual, the method of an artist is absolutely universal. The first personality, which no one should copy.","I often take exercise. Why only yesterday I had breakfast in bed.","The only form of lying that is absolutely beyond reproach is lying for its own sake.","Moderation is a fatal thing. Enough is as bad as a meal. More than enough is as good as a feast.","An egg is always an adventure; the next one may be different.","The more we study Art, the less we care for Nature. What Art really reveals to us is Nature\'s lack of design, her curious crudities, her extraordinary monotony, her absolutely unfinished condition.","It is not good for one\'s morals to see bad acting","The English public always feels perfectly at ease when a mediocrity is talking to it.","Science can never grapple with the irrational. That is why it has no future before it, in this world.","California is an Italy without its art.","My dear fellow, the truth isn\u2019t quite the sort of thing one tells to a nice, sweet, refined girl. What extraordinary ideas you have about the way to behave to a woman!","Faithfulness is to the emotional life what consistency is to the life of the intellect - simply a confession of failures.","All bad poetry springs from genuine feeling. To be natural is to be obvious, and to be obvious is to be inartistic.","We women, as some one says, love with our ears, just as you men love with your eyes.","I could deny it if I liked. I could deny anything if I liked.","When good Americans die, they go to Paris\\" \\"Where do bad Americans go?\\" \\"They stay in America","They are the elect to whom beautiful things mean only Beauty.","What is mind but motion in the intellectual sphere?","The only thing that the artist cannot see is the obvious. The only thing that the public can see is the obvious.","The best work in literature is always done by those who do not depend on it for their daily bread and the highest form of literature, Poetry, brings no wealth to the singer.","No object is so beautiful that, under certain conditions, it will not look ugly.","Death is a great price to pay for a red rose\u201c, cried the Nightingale, \\"and Life is very dear to all. \u201c It is pleasant to sit in the green wood, and watch the Sun in his chariot of gold, and the Moon in her chariot of pearl. Sweet is the scent oft he hawthorn, and sweet are the bluebells that hide in the valley, and the heather that blows on the hill. Yet Love is better than Life, and what is the heart of a bird compared to the heart of a man?","I see that any materialism in life coarsens the soul, and that the hunger of the body and the appetites of the flesh desecrate always, and often destroy.","Psycholog\xady is in its infancy, as a science. I hope in the interests of Art, it will always remain so.","The beautiful, passionate, ruined South, the land of magnolias and music, of roses and romance . . . living on the memory of crushing defeats","The first thing that struck me on landing in America was that if the Americans are not the most well-dressed people in the world, they are the most comfortably dressed.","True love is just like regular love, but with more truth.","Don\'t imagine that your perfection lies in accumulating or possessing external things. Your affection is inside of you.","She behaves as if she was beautiful. Most American women do. It is the secret of their charm.","The fact is, the public make use of the classics of a country as a means of checking the progress of Art. They degrade the classics into authorities. They use them as bludgeons for preventing the free expression of Beauty in new forms.","Oh, I don\u2019t care about Jack. I don\u2019t care for anybody in the whole world but you. I love you, Cecily. You will marry me, won\u2019t you? You silly boy! Of course. Why, we have been engaged for the last three months. For the last three months?","Outcasts always mourn.","He to whom the present is the only thing that is present, knows nothing of the age in which he lives.","The worst of having a romance of any kind is that it leaves one so unromantic.","Never speak disrespectfully of Society, Algernon. Only people who can\u2019t get into it do that.","The basis of action is lack of imagination. It is the last resource of those who know not how to dream.","For the canons of good society are, or should be, the same as the canons of art. Form is absolutely essential to it.","What is abnormal in Life stands in normal relations to Art.  It is the only thing in Life that stands in normal relations to Art.","In England, an inventor is regarded almost as a crazy man, and in too many instances invention ends in disappointment and poverty. In America, an inventor is honoured, help is forthcoming, and the exercise of ingenuity, the application of science to the work of man, is there the shortest road to wealth.","Aestheticism is a search after the signs of the beautiful. It is the science of the beautiful through which men seek the correlation of the arts. It is, to speak more exactly, the search after the secret of life.","The 19thc hatred of Realism is Caliban\'s enraged reaction to seeing his own face in the mirror. The 19thc rejection of Romanticism is Caliban\'s fury at not seeing his face reflected in the mirror.","A method of procuring sensations? Do you think then, that a man who has once committed a murder could possibly do the same crime again? Don\'t tell me that.\\" says Dorian. \\"Oh! anything becomes a pleasure if one does it too often,\\" says Lord Henry","We in the House of Lords are never in touch with public opinion. That makes us a civilised body.","Nature....she will hang the night stars so that I may walk abroad in the darkness without stumbling, and send word the wind over my footprints so that none may track me to my hurt: she will cleanse me in great waters, and with bitter herbs make me whole.","I have never learned anything except from people younger than myself.","His style is chaos illumined by flashes of lightning. As a writer he has mastered everything except language.","I never play cricket. It requires one to assume such indecent postures.","It is perfectly monstrous,\' he said, at last, \'the way people go about nowadays saying things against one behind one\'s back that are absolutely and entirely true.","\\"I hope to-morrow will be a fine day, Lane.\\" \\"It never is, sir.\\" \\"Lane, you\'re a perfect pessimist.\\" \\"I do my best to give satisfaction, sir.\\"","In fact, now you mention the subject, I have been very bad in my own small way. I don\'t think you should be so proud of that, though I am sure it must have been very pleasant.","I have a business appointment that I am anxious... to miss.","And now, dear Mr. Worthing, I will not intrude any longer into a house of sorrow. I would merely beg you not to be too much bowed down by grief. What seem to us bitter trials are often blessings in disguise. This seems to me a blessing of an extremely obvious kind.","I find I have, and a heart doesn\u2019t suit me, Windermere. Somehow it doesn\u2019t go with modern dress. It makes one look old.","You told me you had destroyed it.\\" \\"I was wrong. It has destroyed me.","To be popular one must be a mediocrity.\\" \\"Not with Women,\\" said the duchess, shaking her head; \\"and women rule the world. I assure you we can\'t bear mediocrities. We women, as someone says, love with our ears, just as you men love with your eyes, if you ever love at all.\\" \\"It seems to me that we never do anything else,\\" murmered Dorian.","I worshipped you too much. I am punished for it. You worshipped yourself too much. We are both punished.","LORD ILLINGWORTH: The soul is born old but grows young. That is the comedy of life. MRS ALLONBY: And the body is born young and grows old. That is life\'s tragedy.","What is termed Sin is an essential element of progress.

A woman who didn\'t love me? Oh, all my life!","And when wind and winter harden All the loveless land, It will whisper of the garden, You will understand.","I am not in favour of this modern mania for turning bad people into good people at a moment\'s notice.","memory, like a horrible malady, was eating his soul away","Requiescat Tread lightly, she is near Under the snow, Speak gently, she can hear The daisies grow. All her bright golden hair Tarnished with rust, She that was young and fair Fallen to dust. Lily-like, white as snow, She hardly knew She was a woman, so Sweetly she grew. Coffin-board, heavy stone, Lie on her breast, I vex my heart alone She is at rest. Peace, Peace, she cannot hear Lyre or sonnet, All my life\u2019s buried here, Heap earth upon it.","I don\u2019t regret for a single moment having lived for pleasure.

It is really a revelation.","The essence of thought, as the essence of life, is growth.","Every thing to be true must become a religion.","There is no country in the world where machinery is so lovely as in America.","It is sometimes said that the tragedy of an artist\'s life is that he cannot realise his ideal. But the true tragedy that dogs the steps of most artists is that they realise their ideal too absolutely. For, when the ideal is realised, it is robbed of its wonder and its mystery, and becomes simply a new starting-point for an ideal that is other than itself.","No publisher should ever express an opinion on the value of what he publishes. That is a matter entirely for the literary critic to decide. I can quite understand how any ordinary critic would be strongly prejudiced against a work that was accompanied by a premature and unnecessary panegyric from the publisher. A publisher is simply a useful middle-man. It is not for him to anticipate the verdict of criticism.","The value of an idea has nothing whatsoever to do with the sincerity of the man who expresses it. Indeed, the probabilities are that the more insincere the man is, the more purely intellectual will the idea be, as in that case it will not be coloured by either his wants, his desires, or his prejudices.","The Ideal Man should talk to us as if we were goddesses, and treat us as if we were children. He should refuse all our serious requests, and gratify every one of our whims. He should encourage us to have caprices, and forbid us to have missions. He should always say much more than he means, and always mean much more than he says.","A man who does not think for himself does not think at all. It is grossly selfish to require of one\'s neighbour that he should think in the same way, and hold the same opinions. Why should he? If he can think, he will probably think differently. If he cannot think, it is monstrous to require thought of any kind from him.","It\'s not hard to get the ideas when they come. They just come... it\'s painful waiting for them.","As for modern journalism, it is not my business to defend it. It justifies its own existence by the great Darwinian principle of the survival of the vulgarest.","Life is a great disappointment.","Varnishing is the only artistic process with which Royal Academicians are thoroughly familiar.","It is absurd to say that the age of miracles is past. It has not yet begun.","The salesman knows nothing of what he is selling save that he is charging a great deal too much for it.","Mr. Henry James writes fiction as if it were a painful duty.","There is always something infinitely mean about other people\'s tragedies.","Those who find ugly meanings in beautiful things are corrupt without being charming. This is a fault. Those who find beautiful meanings in beautiful things are the cultivated. For these there is hope. They are the elect to whom beautiful things mean only Beauty. There is no such thing as a moral or an immoral book. Books are well written, or badly written. That is all.","Cheap editions of great books may be delightful, but cheap editions of great men are absolutely detestable","A simile committing suicide is always a depressing spectacle.","To shut one\'s eyes to half of life that one may live securely is as though one blinded oneself that one might walk with more safety in a land of pit and precipice.","Out of the unreal shadows of night comes back the real life that we had known.

That is not such a tragic thing as possibly it sounds to you. To those who are in prison tears are a part of every day\'s experience. A day in prison on which one does not weep is a day on which one\'s heart is hard, not a day on which one\'s heart is happy.","She knew nothing, but she had everything that he had lost.","But what world says that [I\'m wicked]?

Only people like stockbrokers do that, and then only at dinner parties.","The General was essentially a man of peace, except in his domestic life.","And let me touch those curving claws of yellow ivory; and grasp the tail that like a monstrous asp coils round your heavy velvet paws.","You know what a woman\'s curiosity is.","I don\'t like Switzerland; it has produced nothing but theologians and waiters.","The British cook, for her iniquities, is a foolish woman who should be turned into a pillar of salt which she never knows how to use.","Fashion: by which what is really fantastic becomes for a moment the universal.","Give me the luxuries and I can dispense with the necessities.","The only thing that can console one for being poor is extravagance.","As yet, Bernard Shaw hasn\'t become prominent enough to have any enemies, but none of his friends like him.","I could never quite accustom myself to absinthe, but it suits my style so well","Bore: a man who is never unintentionally rude.","The quivering, ardent sunlight showed him the lines of cruelty round the mouth as clearly as if he had been looking into a mirror after he had done some dreadful thing.","It is always with the best intentions that the worst work is done.","The best one can say of modern creative art is that it is just a little less vulgar than reality.","The study of law is sublime, and its practice vulgar.","How strange a thing this is!  The Priest telleth me that the Soul is worth all the gold in the world, and the merchants say that it is not worth a clipped piece of silver.","He had uttered a mad wish that he himself might remain untarnished, and the face on the canvas bear the burden of his passions and his sins; that the painted image might be seared with the lines of suffering and thought, and that he might keep all the delicate bloom and loveliness of his then just conscious boyhood.","If only the picture could grow old, and I stay young.

Life! Don\'t let us go to life for our fulfilment or our experience. Life makes us pay too high a price for its wares, and we purchase the meanest of its secrets at a cost that is monstrous and infinite.","It is difficult not to be unjust to what one loves.","Nature constantly imitates art.","Look at the moon. How strange the moon seems! She is like a woman rising from a tomb. She is like a dead woman. One might fancy she was looking for dead things.","And once, or twice, to throw the dice is a gentlemanly game, But he does not win who plays with Sin in the secret house of shame","Only the great masters of style ever succeed in being obscure.","It was a fatal day when the public discovered that the pen is mightier than the paving-stone and can be made as offensive as a brickbat.","Man is a being with myriad lives and myriad sensations, a complex, multiform creature that bears within itself strange legacies of thought and passion, and whose very flesh is tainted with the monstrous maladies of the dead.","Men are such cowards. They outrage every law in the world and are afraid of the world\'s tongue.","One should absorb the color of life.","People seldom tell the truths that are worth telling. We ought to choose our truths as carefully as we choose our lies and to select our virtues with as much thought as we bestow upon the selection of our enemies.","The world has been made by fools that wise men may live in it.","There is only good art and mediocre art.","Imagination is imitative-the real innovation lies in criticism.","The proper school to learn art is not life but art","Education is an admirable thing.","It is chiefly, I regret to say, through journalism that such people find expression. I regret it because there is much to be said in favour of modern journalism. By giving us the opinions of the uneducated, it keeps us in touch with the ignorance of the community.","In England people actually try to be brilliant at breakfast. That is so dreadful of them! Only dull people are brilliant at breakfast.","Palermo was lovely. The most beautifully situated town in the world - it dreams away its life in the Conca d\'Oro, the exquisite valley that lies between two seas. The lemon groves and the orange gardens were entirely perfect.","Anybody can sympathise with all the sufferings of the pal, nevertheless it involves an extremely great mother nature to sympathise by using a friend\'s achievement.","There were times when it appeared to Dorian Gray that the whole of history was merely the record of his own life, not as he had lived it in act and circumstand, but as his imagination had created it for him, as it had been in his brain and in his passions. He felt that he had known them all, those strange terrible figures that had passed across the stage of the world and made sin so marvellous, and evil so full of subtlety. It seemed to him that in some mysterious way their lives had been his own.","Fashion rests upon folly. Art rests upon law. Fashion is ephemeral. Art is eternal. Indeed what is a fashion really? A fashion is merely a form of ugliness so absolutely unbearable that we have to alter it every six months! It is quite clear that were it beautiful and rational we would not alter anything that combined those two rare qualities. And wherever dress has been so, it has remained unchanged in law and principle for many hundred years.","I am Irish by race but the English have condemned me to talk the language of Shakespeare.","A true artist takes no notice whatever of the public. The public to him are non-existent.","No one wants to see a play called \'Lady Windermere\'s Fan\'. It\'s going to be called \'Cocks in Frocks II\' or I will find another publisher","With subtle and finely-wrought temperaments it is always so. Their strong passions must either bruise or bend. They either slay the man, or themselves die. Shallow sorrows and shallow loves live on. The loves and the sorrows that are great are destroyed by their own plenitude.","She had a passion for secrecy, but she herself was merely a Sphinx without a secret.","The supreme vice is shallowness.","What are American dry-goods? asked the duchess, raising her large hands in wonder and accentuating the verb. American novels, answered Lord Henry.","Why can\'t these American women stay in their own country? They are always telling us that it is the paradise for women. It is. That is the reason why, like Eve, they are so excessively anxious to get out of it.","Young people, nowadays, imagine that money is everything. Yes, murmured Lord Henry, settling his button-hole in his coat; and when they grow older they know it.","Words! Mere words! How terrible they were! How clear, and vivid, and cruel! One could not escape from them. And yet what a subtle magic there was in them!","It is sweet to dance to violins When love and life are fair: To dance to flutes, to dance to lutes Is delicate and rare: But it is not sweet with nimble feet To dance upon the air!","The one charm about the past is that it is the past. But women never know when the curtain has fallen.","Well I won\'t argue about the matter. You always want to argue about things. That is exactly what things were originally made for.","I have been right, Basil, haven\u2019t I, to take my love out of poetry, and to find my wife in Shakespeare\u2019s plays? Lips that Shakespeare taught to speak have whispered their secret in my ear. I have had the arms of Rosalind around me, and kissed Juliet on the mouth.","What the worm was to the corpse, his sins would be to the painted image on the canvas. They would mar its beauty, and eat away its grace. they would defile it, and make it shameful. And yet the thing would still live on. It would be always alive. (Dorian Gray regarding his portrait)","There is no such thing as a good influence. Because to influence a person is to give him one\'s own soul. He does not think his natural thoughts, or burn with his natural passions. His virtures are not real to him. His sins, if there are such thing as sins, are borrowed. He becomes an echo of someone else\'s music, an actor of a part that has not been written for him.","Oh! I don\'t think I would like to catch a sensible man. I shouldn\'t know what to talk to him about.","Most modern calendars mar the sweet simplicity of our lives by reminding us that each day that passes is the anniversary of some perfectly uninteresting event.","My friend is not allowed to go out today. I sit by his side and read him passages from his own life. They fill him with surprise. Everyone should keep someone else\'s diary; I sometimes suspect you of keeping mine.","It can never be necessary to do what is not honourable.","The world has become sad because a puppet was once melancholy. The nihilist, that strange martyr who has no faith, who goes to the stake without enthusiasm, and dies for what he does not believe in, is a purely literary product. He was invented by Turgenev, and completed by Dostoevsky. Robespierre came out of the pages of Rousseau as surely as the People\'s Palace rose out debris of a novel. Literature always anticipates life. It does not copy it, but moulds it to its purpose.","Well, I can\'t eat muffins in an agitated manner. The butter would probably get on my cuffs.","I\'ve now realised for the first time in my life the vital Importance of Being Earnest.","I asked the question for the best reason possible, for the only reason, indeed, that excuses anyone for asking any question - simple curiosity.","My dear Algy, you talk exactly as if you were a dentist. It is very vulgar to talk like a dentist when one isn\'t a dentist. It produces false impression","The weather is entrancing, but in my heart there is no sun.","My writing has gone to bits - like my character. I am simply a self-conscious nerve in pain.","The unread is always better than the unreadable.","There is no good talking to him,\\" said a Dragon-fly, who was sitting on the top of a large brown bulrush; \\"no good at all, for he has gone away.\\" \\"Well, that is his loss, not mine,\\" answered the Rocket. \\"I am not going to stop talking to him merely because he pays no attention. I like hearing myself talk. It is one of my greatest pleasures. I often have long conversations all by myself, and I am so clever that sometimes I don\'t understand a single word of what I am saying.\\" \\"Then you should definitely lecture on Philosophy,\\" said the Dragon-fly.","There were sins whose fascination was more in the memory than in the doing of them, strange triumphs that gratified the pride more than the passions, and gave to the intellect a quickened sense of joy, greater than any joy they brought, or could ever bring, to the senses.","\\"Why is it that at a bachelor\'s establishment the servants invariably drink the champagne? I ask merely for information.\\" \\"I attribute it to the superior quality of the wine, sir. I have often observed that in married households the champagne is rarely of a first-rate brand.\\" \\"Good Heavens! Is marriage so demoralizing as that?\\" \\"I believe it is a very pleasant state, sir. I have had very little experience of it myself up to the present. I have only been married once. That was in consequence of a misunderstanding between myself and a young person.\\"","Well, in the first place girls never marry the men they flirt with. Girls don\'t think it right.","To begin with, I dined there on Monday, and once a week is quite enough to dine with one\'s own relations.","JACK That is nonsense. If I marry a charming girl like Gwendolen, and she is the only girl I ever saw in my life that I would marry, I certainly won\'t want to know Bunbury. ALGERNON Then your wife will. You don\'t seem to realize, that in married life three is company and two is none. JACK That, my dear young friend, is the theory that the corrupt French Drama has been propounding for the last fifty years. ALGERNON Yes; and that the happy English home has proved in half the time.","Yes; poor Bunbury is a dreadful invalid. Well, I must say, Algernon, that I think it is high time that Mr. Bunbury made up his mind whether he was going to live or to die. This shillyshallying with the question is absurd.","Algy, you always adopt a strictly immoral attitude towards life. You are not quite old enough to do that.","JACK Your duty as a gentleman calls you back. ALGERNON My duty as a gentleman has never interfered with my pleasures in the smallest degree.","LADY BRACKNELL Algernon is an extremely, I may almost say an ostentatiously, eligible young man. He has nothing, but he looks everything. What more can one desire?","Nowadays we are all of us so hard up that the only pleasant things to pay are compliments. They\u2019re the only things we can pay.","God knows; I won\'t be an Oxford don anyhow. I\'ll be a poet, a writer, a dramatist. Somehow or other I\'ll be famous, and if not famous, I\'ll be notorious. Or perhaps I\'ll lead the life of pleasure for a time and then\u2014who knows?\u2014rest and do nothing. What does Plato say is the highest end that man can attain here below? To sit down and contemplate the good. Perhaps that will be the end of me too.","Be warned in time, James, and remain, as I do, incomprehensible: to be great is to be misunderstood.","We call ours a utilitarian age, and we do not know the uses of any single thing. We have forgotten that water can cleanse, that fire can purify, and that the Earth is mother to us all.","In England ... education produces no effect whatsoever. If it did, it would prove a serious danger to the upper classes, and would probably lead to acts of violence in Grosvenor Square.","The only form of fiction in which real characters do not seem out of place is history. In novels they are detestable.","Those who try to lead the people can only do so by following the mob.","Ah! somehow life is bigger after all\\nThan any painted angel could we see\\nThe God that is within us!","Religion is the fashionable substitute for belief.","I was disappointed in Niagara - most people must be disappointed in Niagara. Every American bride is taken there, and the sight of the stupendous waterfall must be one of the earliest, if not the keenest, disappointments in American married life.","It is a dangerous thing to reform anyone.","Sometimes it takes courage to give into temptation.","The Americans are certainly hero-worshipers, and always take their heroes from the criminal classes.","If you meet at dinner a man who has spent his life in educating himself - a rare type in our time ... you rise from table richer, and conscious that a high ideal has for a moment touched and sanctified your days. But Oh! my dear Ernest, to sit next to a man who has spent his life in trying to educate others! What a dreadful experience that is!","Youth! There is nothing like youth. The middle-aged are mortgaged to Life. The old are in Life\'s lumber","Personally, I have a great admiration for stupidity.","It is a pity to make a mystery out of what should most easily be understood. There is nothing occult about the thought that all things maybe made well or made ill. A work of art is a well-made thing - that is all. It may be a well-made statue of a well-made chair or a well-made book. Art is not a special sauce applied to ordinary cooking; it is the cooking itself that is good. Most simply and generally, Art may be thought of as \\"The Well Doing of What Needs Doing.\\"","I would not a bit mind sleeping in the cool grass in summer, and when winter came on sheltering myself by the warm close-thatched rick, or under the penthouse of a great barn, provided I had love in my heart.","The form of government that is most suitable to the artist is no government at all. ... One might point out how the Renaissance was great, because it sought to solve no social problem, and busied itself not about such things, but suffered the individual to develop freely, beautifully, and naturally, and so had great and individual artists, and great, individual men. One might point out how Louis XIV, by creating the modern state, destroyed the individualism of the artist.","Anybody can write a three-volume novel. It merely requires a complete ignorance of both life and literature.","Nowadays to be intelligible is to be found out.","There is something very morbid about modern sympathy with pain.","He knew the precise psychological moment when to say nothing.","I can sympathize with everything, except suffering.","The body sins once, and has done with its sin, for action is a mode of purification. Nothing remains then but the recollection of a pleasure, or the luxury of a regret.","The value of an idea has nothing whatever to do with the sincerity of the man who expresses it.","History is merely gossip","Absolute catholicity of taste is not without its dangers.  It is only an auctioneer who should admire all schools of art.","In going to America one learns that poverty is not a necessary accompaniment to civilization.","As for begging, it is safer to beg than to take, but it is finer to take than to beg","It is in the brain that the poppy is red, that the apple is odorous, that the skylark sings.","In art, the public accept what has been, because they cannot alter it, not because they appreciate it. They swallow their classics whole, and never taste them.","He was a hero to his valet, who bullied him, and a terror to most of his relations, whom he bullied in turn. Only England could have produced him, and he always said that the country was going to the dogs. His principles were out of date, but there was a good deal to be said for his prejudices.","I don\'t mind plain women being puritans. It is the only excuse they have for being plain.","Let me be dressed as I will, yet flies worms and flowers exceed me still.","The only proper intoxication is conversation.","Individualism has really the higher aim. Modern morality consists in accepting the standard of one\'s age.","I don\'t like principles. I prefer prejudices.","Intellectual generalities are always interesting, but generalities in morals mean absolutely nothing.","We women adore failures. They lean on us.","The sure way of knowing nothing about life is to try to make oneself useful.","Tell the cook of this restaurant with my compliments that these are the very worst sandwiches in the whole world, and that, when I ask for a watercress sandwich, I do not mean a loaf with a field in the middle of it.","Really, if the lower orders don\'t set a good example, what on earth is the use of them?","Musical people always want one to be perfectly dumb at the very moment when one is longing to be perfectly deaf.","However, it is always nice to be expected, and not to arrive.","The English have a miraculous power of turning wine into water.","America is one long expectoration.","Nowadays, all the married men live like bachelors, and all the bachelors like married men.","The man with a clear conscience probably has a poor memory.","Self-denial is simply a method by which arrests his progress, and self-sacrifice a survival of the mutilation of the savage.","Learned conversation is either the affectation of the ignorant or the profession of the mentally unemployed.","When people talk to us about others they are usually dull. When they talk to us about themselves they are nearly always interesting.","A community is infinitely more brutalised by the habitual employment of punishment than it is by the occasional occurence of crime.","It takes a thoroughly good woman to do a thoroughly stupid thing","A person who, because he has corns himself, always treads on other people\'s toes.","Art, like Nature, has her monsters, things of bestial shape and with hideous voices.","I adore political parties. They are the only place left to us where people don\'t talk politics.","Most men and women are forced to perform parts for which they have no qualification.","Reforms in Russia are very tragic, but they always end in a farce.","Her love was trembling in laughter on her lips.","It is absurd to say that there are neither ruins nor curiosities in America when they have their mothers and their manners.","In England it is enough for a man to try and produce any serious, beautiful work to lose all his rights as a citizen.","I believe it is customary in good society to take some slight refreshment at five o\'clock.","Perhaps in nearly every joy, as certainly in every pleasure, cruelty has its place.","There is something tragic about the enormous number of young men there are in England at the present moment who start life with perfect profiles, and end by adopting some useful profession.","Life, Lady Stutfield, is simply a mauvais quart d\'heure made up of exquisite moments.","Judges, like the criminal classes, have their lighter moments","God\'s eternal laws are kind-and break the heart of stone.","I dislike modern memoirs. They are generally written by people who have either entirely lost their memories, or have never done anything worth remembering.","One should never make one\'s entrance with a scandal. One should reserve that to give an interest to one\'s old age.","Marriage is hardly a thing one can do now and then, except in America.","Women\'s styles may change but their designs remain the same.","Her capacity for family affection is extraordinary. When her third husband died, her hair turned quite gold from grief.","All art is at once surface and symbol.","It is a much cleverer thing to talk nonsense than to listen to it.","Immanuel isn\'t a pun; he Kant be!","All criticism is a form of autobiography","Nature is always behind the age","The only thing that sustains one through life is the consciousness of the immense inferiority of everybody else, and this is a feeling that I have always cultivated.","It is immoral to use private property in order to alleviate the horrible evils that result from the institutions of private property.","I played with an idea, and grew willful; tossed it into the air; transformed it; let it escape and recaptured it; made it iridescent with fancy, and winged it with paradox.","Concordantly, while your first question may be the most pertinent, you may or may not realize it is also the most irrelevant.","Industry is the root of all ugliness.","What do you call a bad man? The sort of man who admires innocence.","It is always painful fo part from people whom one has known for a very brief space of time. The absence of old friends one can endure with equanimity. But even a momentary separation from anyone to whom one has just been introduced is almost unbearable.","Nothing looks so like innocence as an indiscretion.","Early in life she had discovered the important truth that nothing looks so like innocence as an indiscretion; and by a series of reckless escapades, half of them quite harmless, she had acquired all the privileges of a personality.","In spite of the roaring of the young lions at the Union, and the screaming of the rabbits in the home of the vivisect, in spite of Keble College, and the tramways, and the sporting prints, Oxford still remains the most beautiful thing in England, and nowhere else are life and art so exquisitely blended, so perfectly made one.","Everything is dangerous, my dear fellow. If it wasn\'t so, life wouldn\'t be worth living.","There are few things easier than to live badly and die well.","I never saw a man who looked With such a wistful eye Upon that little tent of blue Which prisoners call the sky.","An alliterative prefix served as an ornament of oratory.","I can resist anything but the temptation to make a clever witticism.","Music is the perfect type of art.","It is Nature who makes our artists for us, though it may be Art who taught them their right mode of expression.","Art, like Nature, has her monsters","Nature, which makes nothing durable, always repeats itself so that nothing which it makes may be lost.","Shakespeare might have met Rosencrantz and Guildenstern in the white streets of London, or seen the serving-men of rival houses bite their thumbs at each other in the open square; but Hamlet came out of his soul, and Romeo out of his passion.","Misery and poverty are so absolutely degrading, and exercise such \\n a paralysing effect over the nature of men, that no class is ever really conscious of its own suffering. They have to be told of it by other people, and they often entirely disbelieve them.","Authority is quite degrading.","I was very much disappointed in the Atlantic Ocean.","In one dancing saloon I saw the only rational method of art criticism I have ever come across. Over the piano was printed a notice: \'Please do not shoot the pianist. He is doing his best.\'","America is not a country, it is a world.","Why is it that at a bachelor\'s establishment the servants invariably drink the champagne.","So much had been surrendered! And to such little purpose! There had been mad wilful rejections, monstrous forms of self-torture and self-denial, whose origin was fear and whose result was a degradation infinitely more terrible than that fancied degradation from which, in their ignorance, they had sought to escape.","Who is that man over there? I don\'t know him. What is he doing? Is he a conspirator? Have you searched him? Give him till tomorrow to confess, then hang him! -- hang him!","Despotism is unjust to everybody, including the despot, who was probably made for better things.","Dullness is the coming of age of seriousness.","The American father is never seen in London. He passes his life entirely in Wall Street and communicates with his family once a month by means of a telegram in cipher.","I\'m sure I don\'t know half the people who come to my house. Indeed, from all I hear, I shouldn\'t like to.","On the whole, the great success of marriage in the States is due partly to the fact that no American man is ever idle, and partly to the fact that no American wife is considered responsible for the quality of her husband\'s dinners.","They flaunt their conjugal felicity in one\'s face, as if it were the most fascinating of sins.","Newspapers have degenerated. They may now be absolutely relied upon.","For an artist to marry his model is as fatal as for a gourmet to marry his cook: the one gets no sittings, and the other gets no dinners.","The sign of a Philistine age is the cry of immorality against art.","He thinks like a Tory, and talks like a Radical, and that\'s so important nowadays.","What between the duties expected of one during one\'s lifetime, and the duties exacted from one after one\'s death, land has ceased to be either a profit or a pleasure.

I haven\'t a word to say... Too much care was taken with our education, I am afraid. To have been well brought up is a great drawback nowadays. It shuts one out from so much.","And, as for what is called improving conversation, that is merely the foolish method by which the still more foolish philanthropist feebly tries to disarm the just rancour of the criminal classes.","As a rule, I think they are quite impossible.

And they are always thinking about themselves, when I want them to be thinking about me.","But beauty, real beauty, ends where an intellectual expression begins.","I am afraid that we are beginning to be over-educated; at least everybody who is incapable of learning has taken to teaching -that is really what our enthusiasm for education has come to.","I am afraid that you have been listening to the conversation of someone older than yourself. That is always a dangerous thing to do, and if you allow it to degenerate into a habit, you will find it absolutely fatal to any intellectual development.","The English mind is always in a rage.

This is no time for wearing the shallow mask of manners. When I see a spade I call it a spade. Gwendolen. [Satirically.] I am glad to say that I have never seen a spade. It is obvious that our social spheres have been widely different.","This ghastly state of things is what you call Bunburying, I suppose? Algernon. Yes, and a perfectly wonderful Bunbury it is. The most wonderful Bunbury I have ever had in my life. Jack. Well, you\'ve no right whatsoever to Bunbury here. Algernon. That is absurd. One has a right to Bunbury anywhere one chooses.

It is so loud that one can talk the whole time without other people hearing what one says.","Miss Prism: Do not speak slightingly of the three-volume novel, Cecily. I wrote one myself in earlier days. Cecily: Did you really, Miss Prism? How wonderfully clever you are! I hope it did not end happily? I don\'t like novels that end happily. They depress me so much. Miss Prism: The good ended happily, and the bad unhappily. That is what fiction means.","They did not understand a single word of what he was saying, but that made no matter, for they put their heads on one side, and looked wise, which is quite as good as understanding a thing, and very much easier.","You can hardly imagine that I and Lord Bracknell would dream of allowing our only daughter - a girl brought up with the utmost care - to marry into a cloak-room, and form an alliance with a parcel?","To be born, or at any rate bred, in a hand-bag, whether it had handles or not, seems to me to display a contempt for the ordinary decencies of family life that reminds one of the worst excesses of the French Revolution.","Human life--that appeared to him the one thing worth investigating. Compared to it there was nothing else of any value. It was true that as one watched life in its curious crucible of pain and pleasure, one could not wear over one\'s face a mask of glass, nor keep the sulphurous fumes from troubling the brain and making the imagination turbid with monstrous fancies and misshapen dreams.","It was the passions about whose origin we deceived ourselves that tyrannized most strongly over us.","Thin-lipped wisdom spoke at her from the worn chair, hinted at prudence, quoted from that book of cowardice whose author apes the name of common sense.","Prism!

Crimson was the girdle of petals, and crimson as a ruby was the heart","The great events of life often leave one unmoved; they pass out of consciousness, and, when thinks of them, become unreal. Even the scarlet flowers of passion seem to grow in the same meadow as the poppies of oblivion. We reject the burden of their memory, and have anodynes against them. But the little things, the things of no moment, remain with us. In some tiny ivory cell the brain stores the most delicate, and the most fleeting impressions.","My life-my whole life- take it, and do with it what you will. I love you-love you as I have never loved any living thing. From the moment I met you I loved you, loved you blindly, adoringly,madly! You didn\'t know it then-you know it now.","The terror of society, which is the basis of morals, the terror of God, which is the secret of religion-these are the two things that govern us.","Civilization is not by means an easy thing to attain to. There are only two ways by which man can reach it. One is by being cultured, the other by being corrupt.","And her sweet red lips on these lips of mine Burned like the ruby fire set In the swinging lamp of a crimson shrine, Or the bleeding wounds of the pomegranate, Or the heart of the lotus drenched and wet With the spilt-out blood of the rose-red wine.","It is in the brain, and the brain only, that the great sins of the world take place also.

JACK: Well, yes, I must admit I smoke. LADY BRACKNELL: I\'m glad to hear it. A man should always have an occupation of some kind.","[on his deathbed in a Paris hotel room] Either this wallpaper goes, or I do.","Bunbury? Oh, he was quite exploded. Exploded! Was he the victim of a revolutionary outrage? I was not aware that Mr. Bunbury was interested in social legislation. If so, he is well punished for his morbidity. My dear Aunt Augusta, I mean he was found out! The doctors found out that Bunbury could not , that is what I mean\u2014so Bunbury died. He seems to have had great confidence in the opinion of his physicians.","There was something terribly enthralling in the exercise of influence. No other activity was like it. To project one\'s soul into some gracious form, and let it tarry there for a moment; to hear one\'s own intellectual views echoed back to one with all the added music of passion and youth; to convey one\'s temperament into another as though it were a subtle fluid or a strange perfume: there was a real joy in that - perhaps the most satisfying joy left to us in an age so limited and vulgar as our own, an age grossly carnal in its pleasures, and grossly common in its aims.","You and I will always be friends.\\" \\"Yet you poisoned me with a book once. I should not forgive that.","Then I feel, Harry, that I have given away my whole soul to someone who treats it as if it were a flower to put in his coat, a bit of decoration to charm his vanity, an ornament for a summer\'s day.","Can they feel, I wonder, those white silent people we call the dead?","I had buried my romance in a bed of asphodel.","I am jealous of everything whose beauty does not die.","Any preoccupation with ideas of what is right or wrong in conduct shows an arrested intellectual development.","How you can sit there, calmly eating muffins when we are in this horrible trouble, I can\u2019t make out. You seem to me to be perfectly heartless.\\" \\"Well, I can\u2019t eat muffins in an agitated manner. The butter would probably get on my cuffs. One should always eat muffins quite calmly. It is the only way to eat them.\\" \\"I say it\u2019s perfectly heartless your eating muffins at all, under the circumstances.","Is insincerity such a terrible thing? I think not. It is merely a method by which we can multiply our personalities.","The Number our envious Persons, confirmation our capability.","A man\'s life is of more value than a woman\'s. It has larger issues, wider scope, greater ambitions. Our lives revolve in curves of emotions. It is upon lines of intellect that a man\'s life progresses. I have just learnt this, and much else with it, from Lord Goring. And I will not spoil your life for you, nor see you spoil it as a sacrifice to me, a useless sacrifice.","I will not bare my soul to their shallow prying eyes. My heart shall never be put under their microscope.","American girls are as clever at concealing their parents as English women are at concealing their past.","I was dominated, soul, brain, and power by you. You became to me the visible incarnation of that unseen ideal whose memory haunts us artists like an exquisite dream.","The longer I live, Dorian, the more keenly I feel that whatever was good enough for our fathers is not good enough for us. In art, as in politics, les grand-p\xe8res ont toujours tort.","Oh, don\'t cough, Ernest. When one is dictating one should speak fluently and not cough. Besides, I don\'t know how to spell a cough.","The people who have adored me-- there have not been very many, but there have been some-- have always insisted on living on, long after I had ceased to care for them, or they to care for me.","MRS ALLONBY Is she such a mystery?

MRS ALLONBY Either marry you, or strike you across the face with her glove. What would you do if she struck you across the face with her glove? LORD ILLINGWORTH Fall in love with her, probably.","LADY STUTFIELD I adore silent men. MRS ALLONBY Oh, Ernest isn\'t silent. He talks the whole time. But he has got no conversation. What he talks about I don\'t know. I haven\'t listened to him for years.","It was you I thought of all the time, I gave to them the love you did not need: lavished on them a love that was not theirs.","Lady Bracknell. Good afternoon, dear Algernon, I hope you are behaving very well. Algernon. I\u2019m feeling very well, Aunt Augusta. Lady Bracknell. That\u2019s not quite the same thing. In fact the two things rarely go together.","No woman should have a memory. Memory in a woman is the beginning of dowdiness. One can always tell from a woman\'s bonnet whether she has got a memory or not.","Only love can keep anyone alive.","You know I have loved him always. But we are very poor. Who, being loved, is poor? Oh, no one. I hate my riches. They are a burden.","Women treat us [men] like humanity treats gods \u2013 they worship us and keep bothering us to do something.","Far away beyond the pine-woods,\' he answered, in a low dreamy voice, \'there is a little garden. There the grass grows long and deep, there are the great white stars of the hemlock flower, there the nightingale sings all night long. All night long he sings, and the cold, crystal moon looks down, and the yew-tree spreads out its giant arms over the sleepers.","How sad it is!\\" murmured Dorian Gray with his eyes still fixed upon his own portrait. \\"How sad it is! I shall grow old, and horrible, and dreadful. But this picture will remain always young. It will never be older than this particular day of June\u2026 . If it were only the other way!

I would give my soul for that!","I am jealous of everything whose beauty does not die. I am jealous of the portrait you have painted of me. Why should it keep what I must lose? Every moment that passes takes something from me and gives something to it. Oh, if it were only the other way! If the picture could change, and I could be always what I am now! Why did you paint it? It will mock me some day\u2014mock me horribly!","the costume of the nineteenth century is detestable. It is so sombre, so depressing. Sin is the only real colour-element left in modern life.","What a fuss people make about fidelity!\\" exclaimed Lord Henry. \\"Why, even in love it is purely a question for physiology. It has nothing to do with our own will. Young men want to be faithful, and are not; old men want to be faithless, and cannot: that is all one can say.","When a golden girl can win Prayer from out the lips of sin, When the barren almond bears, And a little child gives away its tears, Then shall all the house be still And peace come to Canterville.","We should treat all the trivial things of life seriously, and all the serious things of life with sincere and studied triviality.","The moment one sits down to think, one becomes all nose, or all forehead, or something horrid","I find him in the curves of certain lines, in the loveliness and subtleties of certain colours.","What a silly thing love is!\' said the student as he walked away. \'It is not half as useful as logic, for it does not prove anything, and it is always telling one of things that are not going to happen, and making one believe things that are not true.

JACK: What fools.","Behind Joy and Laughter there may be a temperament, coarse, hard and callous. But behind Sorrow there is always Sorrow. Pain, unlike Pleasure, wears no mask.","She has form,\\" he said to himself, as he walked away through the grove - \\"that cannot be denied to her; but has she got feeling? I am afraid not. In fact, she is like most artists; she is all style, without any sincerity. She would not sacrifice herself for others. She thinks merely of music, and everybody knows that arts are selfish.

That looks like repentance","Society, civilized society at least, is never very ready to believe anything to the detriment of those who are both rich and fascinating.

To mature its powers, to concentrate its action, to learn the secret of its own strength and of England\'s weakness, the Celtic intellect has had to cross the Atlantic. At home it had but learned the pathetic weakness of nationality; in a strange land it realised what indomitable forces nationality possesses. What captivity was to the Jews, exile has been to the Irish: America and American influence have educated them.","Come down, O Christ, and help me! reach thy hand,\\nFor I am drowning in a stormier sea\\nThan Simon on thy lake of Galilee","In his very rejection of art Walt Whitman is an artist. He tried to produce a certain effect by certain means and he succeeded....He stands apart, and the chief value of his work is in its prophecy, not in its performance. He has begun a prelude to larger themes. He is the herald to a new era. As a man he is the precursor of a fresh type. He is a factor in the heroic and spiritual evolution of the human being. If Poetry has passed him by, Philosophy will take note of him.","There should be a law that no ordinary newspaper should be allowed to write about art. The harm they do by their foolish and random writing it would be impossible to overestimate--not to the artist but to the public.... Without them we would judge a man simply by his work; but at present the newspapers are trying hard to induce the public to judge a sculptor, for instance, never by his statues but by the way he treats his wife; a painter by the amount of his income and a poet by the colour of his necktie.","Whatever, in fact, is modern in our life we owe to the Greeks.

To realize one\'s nature perfectly -- that is what each of us is here for. People are afraid of themselves, nowadays. They have forgotten the highest of all duties, the duty that one owes to oneself. Of course they are charitable. They feed the hungry, and clothe the beggar. But their own souls starve, and are naked. Courage has gone out of our race. Perhaps we never really had it. The terror of society, which is the basis of morals, the terror of God, which is the secret of religion -- these are the two things that govern us.","Never regret thy fall,O Icarus of the fearless flightFor the greatest tragedy of them all Is never to feel the burning light.","I won\'t tell you that the world matters nothing, or the world\'s voice, or the voice of society.

They affect us just as vulgarity affects us. They give usan impression of sheer brute force, and we revolt against that.Sometimes, however, a tragedy that possesses artistic elements ofbeauty crosses our lives. If these elements of beauty are real, thewhole thing simply appeals to our sense of dramatic effect. Suddenlywe find that we are no longer the actors, but the spectators of theplay. Or rather we are both. We watch ourselves, and the mere wonderof the spectacle enthralls us.","I do not approve of anything that tampers with natural ignorance.

That is a very different thing.\\"\\"That may be, but the muffins are the same!","Selfishness is not living as one wishes to live, it is asking others to live as one wishes to live. And unselfishness is letting other people\'s lives alone, not interfering with them. Selfishness always aims at creating around it an absolute uniformity of type. Unselfishness recognizes infinite variety of type as a delightful thing, accepts it, acquiesces in it, enjoys it. It is not selfish to think for oneself. A man who does not think for himself does not think at all. It is grossly selfish to require of one\'s neighbor that he should think in the same way, and hold the same opinions. Why should he? If he can think, he will probably think differently. If he cannot think, it is monstrous to require thought of any kind from him. A red rose is not selfish because it wants to be a red rose. It would be horribly selfish if it wanted all the other flowers in the garden to be both red and roses.","The error all women commit. Why can\u2019t you women love us, faultsand all? Why do you place us on monstrous pedestals? We have all feet ofclay, women as well as men; but when we men love women, we love themknowing their weaknesses, their follies, their imperfections, love them allthe more, it may be, for that reason. It is not the perfect, but the imperfect,who have need of love. It is when we are wounded by our own hands,or by the hands of others, that love should come to cure us \u2013 else what useis love at all? All sins, except a sin against itself, Love should forgive. Alllives, save loveless lives, true Love should pardon. A man\u2019s love is like that.It is wider, larger, more human than a woman\u2019s. Women think that theyare making ideals of men. What they are making of us are false idolsmerely. You made your false idol of me, and I had not the courage tocome down, show you my wounds, tell you my weaknesses.

Gradually white fingers creep through the curtains, and they appear to tremble. In black fantastic shapes, dumb shadows crawl into the corners of the room and crouch there. Outside, there is the stirring of birds among the leaves, or the sound of men going forth to their work, or the sigh and sob of the wind coming down from the hills and wandering round the silent house, as though it feared to wake the sleepers and yet must needs call forth sleep from her purple cave. Veil after veil of thin dusky gauze is lifted, and by degrees the forms and colours of things are restored to them, and we watch the dawn remaking the world in its antique pattern. The wan mirrors get back their mimic life. The flameless tapers stand where we had left them, and beside them lies the half-cut book that we had been studying, or the wired flower that we had worn at the ball, or the letter that we had been afraid to read, or that we had read too often. Nothing seems to us changed. Out of the unreal shadows of the night comes back the real life that we had known. We have to resume it where we had left off, and there steals over us a terrible sense of the necessity for the continuance of energy in the same wearisome round of stereotyped habits, or a wild longing, it may be, that our eyelids might open some morning upon a world that had been refashioned anew in the darkness for our pleasure, a world in which things would have fresh shapes and colours, and be changed, or have other secrets, a world in which the past would have little or no place, or survive, at any rate, in no conscious form of obligation or regret, the remembrance even of joy having its bitterness and the memories of pleasure their pain.","Society, as we have constituted it, will have no place for me, has none to offer; but Nature, whose sweet rains fall on unjust and just alike, will have clefts in the rocks where I may hide, and secret valleys in whose silence I may weep undisturbed. She will hang the night with stars so that I may walk abroad in the darkness without stumbling, and send the wind over my footprints so that none may track me to my hurt: she will cleanse me in great waters, and with bitter herbs make me whole.","I can believe anything provided it is incredible.","I hope, Cecily, I shall not offend you if I state quite frankly and openly that you seem to me to be in every way the visible personification of absolute perfection.","Every one is worthy of love, except him who thinks that he is.

It is like surrendering a part of them. I have grown to love secrecy. It seems to be the one thing that can make modern life mysterious or marvelous to us. The commonest thing is delightful if one only hides it. When I leave town now I never tell my people where I am going. If I did, I would lose all my pleasure. It is a silly habit, I daresay, but somehow it seems to bring a great deal of romance into one\'s life.","The aim of life is self-development.

Even if people employ actual violence, they are not to be violent in turn. That would be to fall to the same low level. After all, even in prison, a man can be quite free. His soul can be free. His personality can be untroubled. He can be at peace. And, above all things, they are not to interfere with other people or judge them in any way. Personality is a very mysterious thing. A man cannot always be estimated by what he does. He may keep the law, and yet be worthless. He may break the law, and yet be fine. He may be bad, without ever doing anything bad. He may commit a sin against society, and yet realize through that sin his true perfection.","If one plays good music, people don\'t listen, and if one plays bad music people don\'t talk.","It\'s an odd thing, but anyone who disappears is said to be seen in San Francisco.It must be a delightful city and possess all the attractions of the next world.","But youth smiles without any reason.

Will it always be so? . . . You have a wonderfully beautiful face, Mr. Gray. Don\'t frown. You have. And beauty is a form of genius-- is higher, indeed, than genius, as it needs no explanation.

It has its divine right of sovereignty. It makes princes of those who have it.You smile? Ah! when you have lost it you won\'t smile. . . . People say sometimes that beauty is only superficial.That may be so, but at least it is not so superficial as thought is. To me, beauty is the wonder of wonders.It is only shallow people who do not judge by appearances. The true mystery of the world is the visible, not the invisible. . . . Yes, Mr. Gray, the gods have been good to you.But what the gods give they quickly take away.

Time is jealous of you, and wars against your lilies and your roses. You will become sallow, and hollow-cheeked, and dull-eyed. You will suffer horribly.... Ah! realize your youth while you have it. Don\'t squander the gold of your days,listening to the tedious, trying to improve the hopeless failure,or giving away your life to the ignorant, the common, and the vulgar.

There was so much in you that charmed me that I felt I must tell you something about yourself.I thought how tragic it would be if you were wasted. For there is such a little time that your youth will last--such a little time.The common hill-flowers wither, but they blossom again.The laburnum will be as yellow next June as it is now.In a month there will be purple stars on the clematis, and year after year the green night of its leaves will hold its purple stars. But we never get back our youth. The pulse of joy that beats in us at twenty becomes sluggish. Our limbs fail, our senses rot. We degenerate into hideous puppets, haunted by the memory of the passions of which we were too much afraid, and the exquisite temptations that we had not the courage to yield to. Youth! Youth!

We cannot. Even the finest and most self-sacrificing emotions have to be paid for. Strangely enough, that is what makes them fine. The intellectual and emotional life of ordinary people is a very contemptible affair. Just as they borrow their ideas from a sort of circulating library of thought\u2014-the Zeitgeist of an age that has no soul\u2014-and send them back soiled at the end of each week, so they always try to get their emotions on credit, and refuse to pay the bill when it comes in. You should pass out of that conception of life. As soon as you have to pay for an emotion you will know its quality, and be the better for such knowledge.

That is the comedy of life.MRS ALLONBY: And the body is born young and grows old. That is life\'s tragedy.","And, after all, what is a fashion?

Life is a question of nerves, and fibres, and slowly built-up cells in which thought hides itself and passion has its dreams. You may fancy yourself safe, and think yourself strong. But a chance tone of colour in a room or a morning sky, a particular perfume that you had once loved and that brings sublte memories with it, a line from a piece of music that you had ceased to play--I tell you Dorian, that it is on things like these that our lives depend.","I know he likes me. Of course I flatter him dreadfully. I find a strange pleasure in saying things to him that I know I shall be sorry for having said...Then I feel, Harry, that I have given away my whole soul to someone who treats it as if it were a flower to put in his coat, a bit of decoration to charm his vanity, an ornament for a summer\'s day.","You, who know all the secrets of life, tell me how to charm Sibyl Vane to love me!

Si se resiste, el alma enferma, anhelando lo que ella misma se ha prohibido, deseando lo que sus leyes monstruosas han hecho monstruoso e ilegal","All authority is quite degrading. It degrades those who exercise it, and degrades those over whom it is exercised. When it is violently, grossly, and cruelly used, it produces a good effect by creating, or at any rate bringing out, the spirit of revolt and individualism that is to kill it. When it is used with a certain amount of kindness, and accompanied by prizes and rewards, it is dreadfully demoralising. People, in that case, are less conscious of the horrible pressure that is being put on them, and so go through their lives in a sort of coarse comfort, like petted animals, without ever realising that they are probably thinking other people\'s thoughts, living by other people\'s standards, wearing practically what one may call other people\'s second-hand clothes, and never being themselves for a single moment.","The Love that dare not speak its name\\" in this century is such a great affection of an elder for a younger man as there was between David and Jonathan, such as Plato made the very basis of his philosophy, and such as you find in the sonnets of Michelangelo and Shakespeare. It is that deep, spiritual affection that is as pure as it is perfect. It dictates and pervades great works of art like those of Shakespeare and Michelangelo, and those two letters of mine, such as they are. It is in this century misunderstood, so much misunderstood that it may be described as the \\"Love that dare not speak its name,\\" and on account of it I am placed where I am now. It is beautiful, it is fine, it is the noblest form of affection. There is nothing unnatural about it. It is intellectual, and it repeatedly exists between an elder and a younger man, when the elder man has intellect, and the younger man has all the joy, hope and glamour of life before him. That it should be so, the world does not understand. The world mocks at it and sometimes puts one in the pillory for it.","There is no such thing as a good influence, Mr. Gray. All influence is immoral - immoral from the scientific point of view.\'\'Why?\'\'Because to influence a person is to give him one\'s own soul. He does not think his natural thoughts, or burn with his natural passions. His virtues are not real to him. His sins, if there are such things as sins, are borrowed. He becomes an echo of someone else\'s music, an actor of a part that has not been written for him. The aim of life is self-development. To realize one\'s nature perfectly - that is what each of us is here ofr. People are afraid of themselves, nowadays. They have forgotten the highest of all duties, the duty that one owes to one\'s self. Of course they are charitable. They feed the hungry, and clothe the beggar. But their own souls starve, and are naked. Courage has gone out of our race. Perhaps we never had it. The terror of society, which is the basis of morals, the terror of God, which is the secret of religion - these are the two things that govern us. And yet [...] I believe that if one man were to live out his life fully and completely, were to give form to every feeling, expression to every thought, reality to every dream - I believe that the world would gain such a fresh impulse of joy that we would forget all maladies of medievalism, and return to the Hellenic ideal - to something finer, richer, than the Hellenic ideal, it may be.

You have thrown it all away. You are shallow and stupid. My God! how mad I was to love you! What a fool I have been! You are nothing to me now. I will never see you again. I will never think of you.

To test reality we must see it on the tight rope. When the verities become acrobats, we can judge them.","When first I was put into prison some people advised me to try and forget who I was. It was ruinous advice. It is only by realising what I am that I have found comfort of any kind. Now I am advised by others to try on my release to forget that I have ever been in a prison at all. I know that would be equally fatal. It would mean that I would always be haunted by an intolerable sense of disgrace, and that those things that are meant for me as much as for anybody else - the beauty of the sun and moon, the pageant of the seasons, the music of daybreak and the silence of great nights, the rain falling through the leaves, or the dew creeping over the grass and making it silver - would all be tainted for me, and lose their healing power, and their power of communicating joy. To regret one\'s own experiences is to arrest one\'s own development. To deny one\'s own experiences is to put a lie into the lips of one\'s own life. It is no less than a denial of the soul.","I hate people who talk about themselves, as you do, when one wants to talk about oneself, as I do.","Religion does not help me.

This shillyshallying with the question is absurd.","In the square below,\u2019 said the Happy Prince, \u2018there stands a little match-girl.

When they go into the world, the world will disagree with them. That is inevitable. The world hates Individualism. But that is not to trouble them. They are to be calm and self-centred. If a man takes their cloak, they are to give him their coat, just to show that material things are of no importance. If people abuse them, they are not to answer back. What does it signify? The things people say of a man do not alter a man. He is what he is. Public opinion is of no value whatsoever. Even if people employ actual violence, they are not to be violent in turn. That would be to fall to the same low level. After all, even in prison, a man can be quite free. His soul can be free. His personality can be untroubled. He can be at peace. And, above all things, they are not to interfere with other people or judge them in any way. Personality is a very mysterious thing. A man cannot always be estimated by what he does. He may keep the law, and yet be worthless. He may break the law, and yet be fine. He may be bad, without ever doing anything bad. He may commit a sin against society, and yet realise through that sin his true perfection.","MISS PRISMMemory, my dear Cecily, is the diary that we all carry about with us.","The pure and simple truth is rarely pure and never simple.","It is in the brain, and the brain only, that the great sins of the world take place","What the artist isalways looking for is the mode of existence in which soul and body areone and indivisible: in which the outward is expressive of the inward: inwhich form reveals.","MRS ALLONBY Is she such a mystery?LORD ILLINGWORTH She is more than a mystery - she is a mood.MRS ALLONBY Moods don\'t last.LORD ILLINGWORTH It is their chief charm.","Man is least himself when he talks in his own person.

It is better not to be different from one\'s fellows. The ugly and the stupid have the best of it in this world. They can sit at their ease and gape at the play.

Sick of using it about others. Weak? Do you really think, that it is weakness that yields to temptation? I tell you that there are terrible temptations that it requires strength, strength and courage, to yield to. To stake all one\'s life on a single moment, to risk everything on one throw, whether the stake be power or pleasure, I care not-there is no weakness in that. There is a horrible, terrible courage. I had that courage.","Nobody is worthy to be loved. The fact that God loves man shows us that in the divine order of ideal things it is written that eternal love is to be given to what is eternally unworthy. Or if that phrase seems to be a bitter one to bear, let us say that everybody is worthy of love, except him who thinks he is.","Behind every exquisite thing that existed, there was something tragic.

Be afraid of nothing","I did not think I should be ever loved: do you indeed Love me so much as now you say you do?Ask of the sea-bird if it loves the sea, Ask of the roses if they love the rain, Ask of the little lark, that will not sing Till day break, if it loves to see the day:And yet, these are but empty images, Mere shadows of my love, which is a fire So great that all the waters of the main Can not avail to quench it.","Down the long and silent street, The dawn, with silver-sandaled feet,Crept like a frightened girl.","Out of the unreal shadows of the night comes back the real life that we had known","Anybody can sympathise with the sufferings of a friend, but it requires a very fine nature \u2013 it requires, in fact, the nature of a true Individualist \u2013 to sympathise with a friend\u2019s success.","there are moments when one has to choose between living one\'s own life, fully, entirely, completely - or dragging out some false, shallow, degrading existence that the world in its hypocrisy demands.","Like two doomed ships that pass in stormWe had crossed each other\'s way:But we made no sign, we said no word,We had no word to say;","The truth is rarely pure and never simple.\xa0 Modern life would be very tedious if it were either, and modern literature a complete impossibility!","What are the unreal things, but the passions that once burned one like fire? What are the incredible things, but the things that one has faithfully believed? What are the improbable things? The things that one has done oneself. No, Ernest; life cheats us with shadows, like a puppet- master. We ask it for pleasure. It gives it to us, with bitterness and disappointment in its train. We come across some noble grief that we think will lend the purple dignity of tragedy to our days, but it passes away from us, and things less noble take its place, and on some grey windy dawn, or odorous eve of silence and of silver, we find ourselves looking with callous wonder, or dull heart of stone, at the tress of gold-flecked hair that we had once so wildly worshipped and so madly kissed.","What nonsense people talk about happy marriages!\\" exclaimed Lord Henry. \\" A man can be happy with any woman, as long as he does not love her.","Oh, I love London Society! It has immensely improved. It is entirely composed now of beautiful idiots and brilliant lunatics. Just what Society should be.","The artist is the creator of beautiful things. To reveal art and conceal the artist is art\'s aim. The critic is he who can translate into another manner or a new material his impression of beautiful things.The highest as the lowest form of criticism is a mode of autobiography. Those who find ugly meanings in beautiful things are corrupt without being charming. This is a fault.Those who find beautiful meanings in beautiful things are the cultivated. For these there is hope.

That is all.The nineteenth century dislike of realism is the rage of Caliban seeing his own face in a glass.The nineteenth century dislike of romanticism is the rage of Caliban not seeing his own face in a glass. The moral life of man forms part of the subject-matter of the artist, but the morality of art consists in the perfect use of an imperfect medium. No artist desires to prove anything. Even things that are true can be proved. No artist has ethical sympathies. An ethical sympathy in an artist is an unpardonable mannerism of style. No artist is ever morbid. The artist can express everything. Thought and language are to the artist instruments of an art. Vice and virtue are to the artist materials for an art. From the point of view of form, the type of all the arts is the art of the musician. From the point of view of feeling, the actor\'s craft is the type. All art is at once surface and symbol. Those who go beneath the surface do so at their peril. Those who read the symbol do so at their peril. It is the spectator, and not life, that art really mirrors. Diversity of opinion about a work of art shows that the work is new, complex, and vital. When critics disagree, the artist is in accord with himself. We can forgive a man for making a useful thing as long as he does not admire it. The only excuse for making a useless thing is that one admires it intensely.All art is quite useless.","It is tragic how few people ever \u2018possess their souls\u2019 before they die. \u2018Nothing is more rare in any man,\u2019 says Emerson, \u2018than an act of his own.\u2019 It is quite true.

Romance is a thing of the past.\u201d","God made the world just as much for me as for any one else.","What a silly thing Love is. It is not as useful as Logic, for it does not prove anything, and it is always telling one of things that are not going to happen, and making one believe things that are not true. In fact, it is quite unpractical, and, as in this age to be practical is everything, I shall go back to Philosophy and study Metaphysics.","I like to do all the talking myself.\xa0 It saves time, and prevents arguments. \u201cBut\u201d","One should never do anything that one cannot talk about after dinner.","What are you?\\" \\"To define is to limit.","The great things of life are what they seem to be, and for that reason, strange as it may sound to you, are often difficult to interpret.

We have nothing else to think of. Suffering \u2015 curious as it may sound to you \u2015 is the means by which we exist, because it is the only means by which we become conscious of existing; and the remembrance of suffering in the past is necessary to us as the warrant, the evidence, of our continued identity.","You know I have loved him always.But we are very poor.Who, being loved, is poor?

But the true tragedy that dogs the steps of most artists is that they realize their ideal too absolutely. For, when the ideal is realized, it is robbed of its wonder and its mystery, and becomes simply a new starting point for an ideal that is other than itself. This is why music is the perfect type of art. Music can never reveal its ultimate secret.","Do you think that I would not have let you know that, if you suffered, I was suffering too: that if you wept there were tears in my eyes also: and that if you lay in the house of bondage and were despised of men, I out of my griefs had built a house in which to dwell until your coming, a treasury in which all that man had denied to you would be laid up for your healing, one hundredfold in increase?","What are American dry-goods? asked the duchess, raising her large hands in wonder and accentuating the verb.American novels, answered Lord Henry.","I didn\u2019t say I liked it.

Romance is a thing of the past.","The majority of people spoil their lives by an unhealthy and exaggerated altruism \u2013 are forced, indeed, so to spoil them. They find themselves surrounded by hideous poverty, by hideous ugliness, by hideous starvation. It is inevitable that they should be strongly moved by all this. The emotions of man are stirred more quickly than man\u2019s intelligence; and, as I pointed out some time ago in an article on the function of criticism, it is much more easy to have sympathy with suffering than it is to have sympathy with thought. Accordingly, with admirable, though misdirected intentions, they very seriously and very sentimentally set themselves to the task of remedying the evils that they see. But their remedies do not cure the disease: they merely prolong it. Indeed, their remedies are part of the disease.They try to solve the problem of poverty, for instance, by keeping the poor alive; or, in the case of a very advanced school, by amusing the poor.But this is not a solution: it is an aggravation of the difficulty. The proper aim is to try and reconstruct society on such a basis that poverty will be impossible. And the altruistic virtues have really prevented the carrying out of this aim. Just as the worst slave-owners were those who were kind to their slaves, and so prevented the horror of the system being realised by those who suffered from it, and understood by those who contemplated it, so, in the present state of things in England, the people who do most harm are the people who try to do most good; and at last we have had the spectacle of men who have really studied the problem and know the life \u2013 educated men who live in the East End \u2013 coming forward and imploring the community to restrain its altruistic impulses of charity, benevolence, and the like. They do so on the ground that such charity degrades and demoralises. They are perfectly right. Charity creates a multitude of sins.","I like hearing myself talk. It is one of my greatest pleasures. I often have long conversations all by myself, and I am so clever that I sometimes don\'t understand a single word of what I am saying.","What you have told me is quite a romance, a romance of art one might call it, and the worst of having a romance of any kind is that it leaves one so unromantic.","A true artist takes no notice whatever of the public.

One who is entirely ignorant of the modes of Art in its revolution or the moods of thought in its progress, of the pomp of the Latin line or the richer music of the vowelled Greeks, of Tuscan sculpture or Elizabethan song may yet be full of the very sweetest wisdom. The real fool, such as the gods mock or mar, is he who does not know himself. I was such a one too long. You have been such a one too long. Be so no more. Do not be afraid.

They are Hamlet\'s college friends. They have been his companions. They bring with them memories of pleasant days together. At the moment when they come across him in the play he is staggering under the weight of a burden intolerable to one of his temperament. The dead have come armed out of the grave to impose on him a mission at once too great and too mean for him. He is a dreamer, and he is called upon to act. He has the nature of the poet, and he is asked to grapple with the common complexity of cause and effect, with life in its practical realisation, of which he knows nothing, not with life in its ideal essence, of which he knows so much. He has no conception of what to do, and his folly is to feign folly. Brutus used madness as a cloak to conceal the sword of his purpose, the dagger of his will, but the Hamlet madness is a mere mask for the hiding of weakness. In the making of fancies and jests he sees a chance of delay. He keeps playing with action as an artist plays with a theory. He makes himself the spy of his proper actions, and listening to his own words knows them to be but \'words, words, words.\' Instead of trying to be the hero of his own history, he seeks to be the spectator of his own tragedy. He disbelieves in everything, including himself, and yet his doubt helps him not, as it comes not from scepticism but from a divided will.Of all this Guildenstern and Rosencrantz realise nothing. They bow and smirk and smile, and what the one says the other echoes with sickliest intonation. When, at last, by means of the play within the play, and the puppets in their dalliance, Hamlet \'catches the conscience\' of the King, and drives the wretched man in terror from his throne, Guildenstern and Rosencrantz see no more in his conduct than a rather painful breach of Court etiquette. That is as far as they can attain to in \'the contemplation of the spectacle of life with appropriate emotions.\' They are close to his very secret and know nothing of it. Nor would there be any use in telling them. They are the little cups that can hold so much and no more.","It is perfectly monstrous the way people go about, nowadays, saying things against one behind one\'s back that are absolutely and entirely true.","And now, dear Mr. Worthing, I will not intrude any longer into a house of sorrow.

Movement, that problem of the visible arts, can be truly realised by Literature alone.

They degrade the classics into authorities.... A fresh mode of Beauty is absolutely distasteful to them, and whenever it appears they get so angry and bewildered that they always use two stupid expressions--one is that the work of art is grossly unintelligible; the other, that the work of art is grossly immoral. What they mean by these words seems to me to be this. When they say a work is grossly unintelligible, they mean that the artist has said or made a beautiful thing that is new; when they describe a work as grossly immoral, they mean that the artist has said or made a beautiful thing that is true.","Pray do!

The faith that others give to what is unseen, I give to what one can touch, and look at. My gods dwell in temples made with hands; and within the circle of actual experience is my creed made perfect and complete: too complete, it may be, for like many or all of those who have placed their heaven in this earth, I have found in it not merely the beauty of heaven, but the horror of hell also. When I think about religion at all, I feel as if I would like to found an order for those who cannot believe: the Confraternity of the Faithless, one might call it, where on an altar, on which no taper burned, a priest, in whose heart peace had no dwelling, might celebrate with unblessed bread and a chalice empty of wine. Every thing to be true must become a religion. And agnosticism should have its ritual no less than faith. It has sown its martyrs, it should reap its saints, and praise God daily for having hidden Himself from man. But whether it be faith or agnosticism, it must be nothing external to me. Its symbols must be of my own creating. Only that is spiritual which makes its own form. If I may not find its secret within myself, I shall never find it: if I have not got it already, it will never come to me.","Well, I can\u2019t help going to see Sibyl play, even if it is only for an act.

He saw that there was no mood of the mind that had not its counterpart in the sensuous life, and set himself to discover their true relations, wondering what there was in frankincense that made one mystical, and in ambergris that stirred one\u2019s passions, and in violets that woke the memory of dead romances, and in musk that troubled the brain, and in champak that stained the imagination; and seeking often to elaborate a real psychology of perfumes, and to estimate the several influences of sweet-smelling roots, and scented pollen-laden flower, of aromatic balms, and of dark and fragrant woods, of spikenard that sickens, of hovenia that makes men mad, and of aloes that are said to be able to expel melancholy from the soul.","Sin is the only real colour-element left in modern life.\'\'You really must not say things like that before Dorian, Harry.\'\'Before which Dorian?

When the man\u2019s punishmentis over, it leaves him to himself; that is to say, it abandons him at thevery moment when its highest duty towards him begins.

To have friends, you know, one need only be good-natured; but when a man has no enemy left there must be something mean about him.","A man who is master of himself can end a sorrow as easily as he can invent a pleasure.

To realise the nineteenth century, one must realise every century that has preceded it and that has contributed to its making. To know anything about oneself one must know all about others.","Well, I can\'t eat muffins in an agitated manner. The butter would probably get on my cuffs. One should always eat muffins quite calmly. It is the only way to eat them.","Sometimes the poor are praised for being thrifty. But to recommend thrift to the poor is both grotesque and insulting. It is like advising a man who is starving to eat less. For a town or country labourer to practise thrift would be absolutely immoral. Man should not be ready to show that he can live like a badly-fed animal. He should decline to live like that, and should either steal or go on the rates, which is considered by many to be a form of stealing.","We caught the tread of dancing feet,We loitered down the moonlit street,And stopped beneath the harlot\'s house.Inside, above the din and fray,We heard the loud musicians playThe \'Treues Liebes Herz\' of Strauss.Like strange mechanical grotesques,Making fantastic arabesques,The shadows raced across the blind.We watched the ghostly dancers spinTo sound of horn and violin,Like black leaves wheeling in the wind.Like wire-pulled automatons,Slim silhouetted skeletonsWent sidling through the slow quadrille,Then took each other by the hand,And danced a stately saraband;Their laughter echoed thin and shrill. Sometimes a clockwork puppet pressedA phantom lover to her breast,Sometimes they seemed to try to sing.Sometimes a horrible marionetteCame out, and smoked its cigaretteUpon the steps like a live thing.Then, turning to my love, I said,\'The dead are dancing with the dead,The dust is whirling with the dust.\'But she--she heard the violin,And left my side, and entered in:Love passed into the house of lust.Then suddenly the tune went false,The dancers wearied of the waltz,The shadows ceased to wheel and whirl.And down the long and silent street,The dawn, with silver-sandalled feet,Crept like a frightened girl.","When they entered they found, hanging upon the wall, a splendid portrait of their master as they had last seen him, in all the wonder of his exquisite youth and beauty. Lying on the floor was a dead man, in evening dress, with a knife in his heart. He was withered, wrinkled, and loathsome of visage. It was not till they had examined the rings that they recognised who it was.","My existence is a scandal","I love you, I love you, my heart is a rose which your love has brought to bloom, my life is a desert fanned by the delicious breeze of your breath, and whose cool spring are your eyes; the imprint of your little feet makes valleys of shade for me, the odour of your hair is like myrrh, and wherever you go you exhale the perfumes of the cassia tree.Love me always, love me always. You have been the supreme, the perfect love of my life; there can be no other...","To make a good salad is to be a brilliant diplomat - the problem is entirely the same in both cases. To know how much oil to mix in with one\'s vinegar.","Perhaps one never seems so much at one\'s ease as when one has to play a part.","Well, she wore far too much rouge last night, and not quite enough clothes. That is always a sign of desperation in a woman.","Out of the unreal shadows of the night comes back the real life that we had known. We have to resume it where we had left off, and there steals over us a terrible sense of the necessity for the continuance of energy in the same wearisome round of stereotyped habits, or a wild longing, it may be, that our eyelids might open some morning upon a world that had been refashioned anew in the darkness for our pleasure, a world in which things would have fresh shapes and colours, and be changed, or have other secrets, a world in which the past would have little or no place, or survive, at any rate, in no conscious form of obligation or regret, the remembrance even of joy having its bitterness and the memories of pleasure their pain.","Men marry because they are tired; women because they are curious. Both are disappointed.","If after I am free a friend of mine gave a feast, and did not invite me to it, I should not mind a bit. I can be perfectly happy by myself. With freedom, flowers, books, and the moon, who could not be perfectly happy?","I never saw sad men who lookedWith such a wistful eye Upon that little tent of blue We prisoners called the sky, And at every happy cloud that passed In such strange freedom by.","That is one of the great secrets of life Nowadays most people die of a sort of creeping common sense, and discover when it is too late that the only things one never regrets are one\'s mistakes.","With an evening coat and a white tie, as you told me once, anybody, even a stock-broker, can gain a reputation for being civilized.","But the bravest man amongst us is afraid of himself. The mutilation of the savage has its tragic survival in the self-denial that mars our lives. We are punished for our refusals. Every impulse that we strive to strangle broods in the mind and poisons us. The body sins once, and has done with its sin, for action is a mode of purification. Nothing remains then but the recollection of a pleasure, or the luxury of a regret. The only way to get rid of a temptation is to yield to it. Resist it, and your soul grows sick with longing for the things it has forbidden to itself, with desire for what its monstrous laws have made monstrous and unlawful. It has been said that the great events of the world take place in the brain. It is in the brain, and the brain only, that the great sins of the world take place also.","For the recognition of private property has really harmed Individualism, and obscured it, by confusing a man with what he possesses.\xa0 It has led Individualism entirely astray.\xa0 It has made gain not growth its aim.\xa0 So that man thought that the important thing was to have, and did not know that the important thing is to be.\xa0 The true perfection of man lies, not in what man has, but in what man is.","Ah! thou wouldst not suffer me to kiss thy mouth, Iokanaan. Well! I will kiss it now. I will bite it with my teeth as one bites a ripe fruit. Yes, I will kiss thy mouth, Iokanaan. I said it; did I not say it? I said it. Ah! I will kiss it now . . . . But wherefore dost thou not look at me, Iokanaan? Thine eyes that were so terrible, so full of rage and scorn, are shut now. Wherefore are they shut? Open thine eyes! Lift up thine eyelids, Iokanaan! Wherefore dost thou not look at me? Art thou afraid of me, Iokanaan, that thou wilt not look at me?","Of course, I should have got rid of you.

It is an absurd attitude to take towards life. We are not sent into the world to air our moral prejudices.","What the paradox was to me in the sphere of thought, perversitybecame to me in the sphere of passion.

It annihilates the desire to act. It is superbly sterile. The books that the world calls immoral are books that show the world its own shame.","He is all my art to me now,\\" said the painter gravely. \\"I sometimes think, Harry, that there are only two eras of any importance in the world\'s history. The first is the appearance of a new medium for art, and the second is the appearance of a new personality for art also. What the invention of oil-painting was to the Venetians, the face of Antinous was to late Greek sculpture, and the face of Dorian Gray will some day be to me. It is not merely that I paint from him, draw from him, sketch from him. Of course, I have done all that. But he is much more to me than a model or a sitter. I won\'t tell you that I am dissatisfied with what I have done of him, or that his beauty is such that art cannot express it. There is nothing that art cannot express, and I know that the work I have done, since I met Dorian Gray, is good work, is the best work of my life. But in some curious way\u2014I wonder will you understand me?\u2014his personality has suggested to me an entirely new manner in art, an entirely new mode of style. I see things differently, I think of them differently. I can now recreate life in a way that was hidden from me before. \'A dream of form in days of thought\'\u2014who is it who says that? I forget; but it is what Dorian Gray has been to me. The merely visible presence of this lad\u2014for he seems to me little more than a lad, though he is really over twenty\u2014 his merely visible presence\u2014ah! I wonder can you realize all that that means? Unconsciously he defines for me the lines of a fresh school, a school that is to have in it all the passion of the romantic spirit, all the perfection of the spirit that is Greek. The harmony of soul and body\u2014 how much that is! We in our madness have separated the two, and have invented a realism that is vulgar, an ideality that is void. Harry! if you only knew what Dorian Gray is to me! You remember that landscape of mine, for which Agnew offered me such a huge price but which I would not part with? It is one of the best things I have ever done. And why is it so? Because, while I was painting it, Dorian Gray sat beside me. Some subtle influence passed from him to me, and for the first time in my life I saw in the plain woodland the wonder I had always looked for and always missed.","The artist is the creator of beautiful things. To reveal art and conceal the artist is art\'s aim. The critic is he who can translate into another manner or a new material his impression of beautiful things. The highest as the lowest form of criticism is a mode of autobiography. Those who find ugly meanings in beautiful things are corrupt without being charming. This is a fault. Those who find beautiful meanings in beautiful things are the cultivated. For these there is hope. They are the elect to whom beautiful things mean only beauty. There is no such thing as a moral or an immoral book. Books are well written, or badly written. That is all. The nineteenth century dislike of realism is the rage of Caliban seeing his own face in a glass. The nineteenth century dislike of romanticism is the rage of Caliban not seeing his own face in a glass. The moral life of man forms part of the subject-matter of the artist, but the morality of art consists in the perfect use of an imperfect medium. No artist desires to prove anything. Even things that are true can be proved. No artist has ethical sympathies. An ethical sympathy in an artist is an unpardonable mannerism of style. No artist is ever morbid. The artist can express everything. Thought and language are to the artist instruments of an art. Vice and virtue are to the artist materials for an art. From the point of view of form, the type of all the arts is the art of the musician. From the point of view of feeling, the actor\'s craft is the type. All art is at once surface and symbol. Those who go beneath the surface do so at their peril. Those who read the symbol do so at their peril. It is the spectator, and not life, that art really mirrors. Diversity of opinion about a work of art shows that the work is new, complex, and vital. When critics disagree, the artist is in accord with himself. We can forgive a man for making a useful thing as long as he does not admire it. The only excuse for making a useless thing is that one admires it intensely. All art is quite useless. OSCAR WILDE","In love, one always begins in deceiving oneself, and one always ends in deceiving others.","I make a great difference between people. I choose my friends for their good looks, my acquaintances for their good characters, and my enemies for their good intellects. A man cannot be too careful in the choice of his enemies. I have not got one who is a fool. They are all men of some intellectual power, and consequently they all appreciate me. Is that very vain of me? I think it is rather vain.","My dear boy,\\" said Lord Henry, smiling, \\"anybody can be good in the country. There are no temptations there. That is the reason why people who live out of town are so absolutely uncivilized. Civilization is not, by any means, an easy thing to attain to. There are only two ways by which men can reach it. One is by being cultured, the other by being corrupt. Country people have no opportunity of being either, so they stagnate.","Once in New York, you are sure to be a great success.

In the wild struggle for existence, we want to have something that endures, and so we fill our minds with rubbish and facts, in the silly hope of keeping our place. The thoroughly well-informed man - that is the modern ideal. And the mind of the thoroughly well-informed man is a dreadful thing. It is like a bric-a-brac shop, all monsters and dust, with everything priced above its proper value.","Every impulse that we strive to strangle broods in the mind and poisons us.","To call an artist morbid because he deals with morbidity as his subject-matter is as silly as if one called Shakespeare mad because he wrote \u2018King Lear.","Punctuality is the thief of time.","The life that was to make his soul would mar his body.","Mary Farquhar, who always flirts with her own husband across the dinner-table.

The basis of optimism is sheer terror. We think that we are generous because we credit our neighbor with the possession of those virtues that are likely to be a benefit to us.","My father told me to go to bed an hour ago.

People are either hunting for husbands, or hiding from them.","That is what the highest criticism really is, the record of one\'s own soul. It is more fascinating than history, as it is concerned simply with oneself. It is more delightful than philosophy, as its subject is concrete and not abstract, real and not vague. It is the only civilized form of autobiography, as it deals not with events, but with the thoughts of one\'s life; not with life\'s physical accidents of deed or circumstance, but with the spiritual moods and imaginative passions of the mind...The best that one can say of most modern creative art is that it is just a little less vulgar than reality, and so the critic, with his fine sense of distinction and sure instinct of delicate refinement, will prefer to look into the silver mirror or through the woven veil, and will turn his eyes away from the chaos and clamor of actual existence, though the mirror be tarnished and the veil be torn. His sole aim is to chronicle his own impressions. It is for him that pictures are painted, books written, and marble hewn into form.","There is no such thing as a good influence, Mr. Gray.

He does not think his natural thoughts, or burn with his natural passions. His virtues are not real to him. His sins, if there are such things as sins, are borrowed. He becomes an echo of some one else\'s music, an actor of a part that has not been written for him. The aim of life is self-development. To realize one\'s nature perfectly\u2014that is what each of us is here for. People are afraid of themselves, nowadays. They have forgotten the highest of all duties, the duty hat one owes to one\'s self. Of course, they are charitable. They feed the hungry and clothe the beggar. But their own souls starve, and are naked. Courage has gone out of our race. Perhaps we never really had it. The terror of society, which is the basis of morals, the terror of God, which is the secret of religion\u2014these are the two things that govern us. And yet, I believe that if one man were to live out his life fully and completely, were to give form to every feeling, expression to every thought, reality to every dream\u2014I believe that the world would gain such a fresh impulse of joy that we would forget all the maladies of mediaevalism, and return to the Hellenic ideal\u2014to something finer, richer than the Hellenic ideal, it may be.

As for keeping myself dry, there is evidently no one here who can at all appreciate an emotional nature. Fortunately for myself, I don\u2019t care.

When they opened, the mist of a dream had passed across them.","Do you want to kill his love for you? What sort of existence will he have if you rob him of the fruits of his ambition, if you take him from the splendour of a great political career, if you close the doors of public life against him, if you condemn him to sterile failure, he who was made for triumph and success? Women are not meant to judge us but to forgive us when we need forgiveness. Pardon, not punishment, is their mission. Why should you scourge him with rods for a sin done in his youth, before he knew you, before he knew himself? A man\'s life is of more value than a woman\'s. It has larger issues, wider scope, greater ambitions. A women\'s life revolves around curves of emotions. It is upon lines of intellect that man\'s life progresses. Don\'t make any terrible mistake, Lady Chiltern. A woman who can keep a man\'s love, and love him in return, has done all the world wants of women, or should want of them.","Never trust a woman who wears mauve.","Relations are simply a tedious pack of people, who haven\u2019t got the remotest knowledge of how to live, nor the smallest instinct about when to die.","It would kill the past, and when that was dead, he would be free.","We live, I regret to say, in an age of surfaces","To get back one\'s youth, one has merely to repeat one\'s follies.","Dorian Gray listened, open-eyed and wondering. The spray of lilac fell from his hand upon the gravel. A furry bee came and buzzed round it for a moment. Then it began to scramble all over the oval stellated globe of the tiny blossoms. He watched it with that strange interest in trivial things that we try to develop when things of high import make us afraid, or when we are stirred by some new emotion for which we cannot find expression, or when some though that terrifies us lays sudden siege to the brain and calls on us to yield.","But I loved Narcissus because as he lay on my banks and looked down at me, in the mirror of his eyes I saw ever my own beauty mirrored.","What you have told me is quite a romance, a romance of art one might call it, and the worst of having a romantic of any kind is that it leaves one so unromantic.","It is always twilight in one\u2019s cell, as it is always twilight in one\u2019s heart.

She was a curious woman, whose dresses always looked as if they had been designed in a rage and put on in a tempest.

It was merely weakness. One half-hour with Art was always more to me than a cycle with you. Nothing really at any period of my life was ever of the smallest importance to me compared with Art.

Faithlessness is to the emotional life what consistency is to the intellectual life,\u2014simply a confession of failure.","If one hears bad music, it is one\'s duty to drown it in conversation.","You came to me to learn the Pleasure of Life and the Pleasure of Art. Perhaps I am chosen to teach you something much more wonderful, the meaning of Sorrow and its beauty.","Of course married life is merely a habit, a bad habit. But then one regrets the loss even of one\'s worse habits.","I love scandals about other people, but scandals about myself do not interest me. The have not got the charm of novelty.","She was usually in love with somebody, and, as her passion was never returned, she had kept all her illusions.","It often happened that when we thought we were experimenting on others we were really experimenting on ourselves.","The passion for property is in it. There are many things that we would throw away if we were not afraid others might pick them up.","I never change.MRS.

Beautiful sins, like beautiful things, are the privilege of the rich.","I suppose because we have no ruins and no curiosities, said Virginia satirically.\u201d","How dreadful!\\" cried Lord Harry. \\"I can stand brute force, but brute reason is quite unbearable. There is something unfair about its use. It is hitting below the intellect.","out of sorrow have the worlds been built, and at the birth of a child or a star, there is pain","I can sympathise with everything, except suffering\\", cried Lord Harry, Shrugging his shoulders. \\"I cannot sympathise with that. It is too ugly, too horrible, too distressing. There is something terribly morbid in the modern sympathy with pain.","As one reads history, not in the expurgated editions written for schoolboys and passmen, but in the original authorities of each time, one is absolutely sickened, not by the crimes that the wicked have committed, but by the punishments that the good have inflicted; and a community is infinitely more brutalized by the habitual employment of punishment than it is by the occasional occurrence of crime.","Looking around his hotel room not long before expiring: \\"This wallpaper is killing me.

But women never know when the curtain has fallen. They always want a sixth act, and as soon as the interest of the play is entirely over, they propose to continue it. If they were allowed their own way, every comedy would have a tragic ending, and every tragedy would culminate in a farce. They are charmingly artificial, but they have no sense of art.","I can resist anything but temptation","You have not realized how I have developed. I was a schoolboy when you knew me. I am a man now.

A green, an unripe time, a time of shallow moods, and sickly thoughts.","I want to make Romeo jealous. I want the dead lovers of the world to hear our laughter, and grow sad.

Happy they whose hearts can breakAnd peace of pardon win!How else may man make straight his pathAnd cleanse his soul from sin?How else but through a broken heartMay the Lord Christ enter in?","I understand what you mean, and I believe in this girl. Anyone you love must be marvellous, and any girl that has the effect you describe must be fine and noble. To spiritualise one\'s age--that is something worth doing. If this girl can give a soul to those who have lived without one, if she can create the sense of beauty in people whose lives have been sordid and ugly, if she can strip them of their selfishness and lend them tears for sorrows that are not their own, she is worthy of all your adoration, worthy of the adoration of the world.","Yet the roses are not less lovely for all that","MRS ALLONBY You have your looking-glassLORD ILLINGWORTH It is unkind.

I certainly hope that I do; for where there is no exaggeration there is no love, and where there is no love there is no understanding. It is only about things that do not interest one, that one can give a really unbiassed opinion; and this is no doubt the reason why an unbiassed opinion is always valueless.","Most people become bankrupt through having invested too heavily in the prose of life. To have ruined one\'s self over poetry is an honour.","When they make up their ledger, they balance stupidity by wealth, and vice by hypocrisy.","I should be sorry to be on the same level as an age like this.","Of course to one so modern as I am, `Enfant de mon si\xe8cle,\u2019 merely to look at the world will be always lovely. I tremble with pleasure when I think that on the very day of my leaving prison both the laburnum and the lilac will be blooming in the gardens, and that I shall see the wind stir into restless beauty the swaying gold of the one, and make the other toss the pale purple of its plumes, so that all the air shall be Arabia for me. Linnaeus fell on his knees and wept for joy when he saw for the first time the long heath of some English upland made yellow with the tawny aromatic brooms of the common furze; and I know that for me, to whom flowers are part of desire, there are tears waiting in the petals of some rose. It has always been so with me from my boyhood. There is not a single colour hidden away in the chalice of a flower, or the curve of a shell, to which, by some subtle sympathy with the very soul of things, my nature does not answer. Like Gautier, I have always been one of those \u2018pour qui le monde visible existe.","Nowadays people know the price of everything, and the value of nothing.","something was dead in each of us,and what was dead was hope.","The only artists I have ever known, who are personally delightful, are bad artists. Good artists exist simply in what they make, and consequently are perfect uninteresting in what they are.","No object is so beautiful that, under certain conditions, it will not look ugly","Morality does not help me. I am a born antinomian. I am one of those who are made for exceptions, not for laws. But while I see that there is nothing wrong in what one does, I see that there is something wrong in what one becomes.

Poetry is an instance of what I mean. We have been able to have fine poetry in England because the public do not read it, and consequently do not influence it.","There is nothing sane about the worship of beauty. It is too splendid to be sane. Those of whose lives it forms the dominant note will always seem to the world to be pure visionaries.","My dear fellow, I am prepared to prove anything.","The harmony of soul and body - how much that is! We in our madness have separated the two, and have invented a realism that is vulgar, and ideality that is void.","As he looked back upon man moving through History, he was haunted by a feeling of loss. So much had been surrendered! and to such little purpose!...Hedonism... was to teach man to concentrate himself upon the moments of a life that is but itself a moment.","It is to do nothing that the elect exist. Action is limited and relative. Unlimited and absolute is the vision of him who sits at ease and watches, who walks in loneliness and dreams.","There is always something ridiculous about the emotions of people whom one has ceased to love. Sibyl Vane seemed to him to be absurdly melodramatic. Her tears and sobs annoyed him.","Every good story-teller nowadays starts with the end, andthen goes on to the beginning, and concludes with themiddle...","I can resist everything but temptation.","You will always be loved, and you will always be in love with love.","It is only shallow people who require years to get rid of an emotion. A man who is master of himself can end a sorrow as easily as he can invent a pleasure.","Thou knowest all; I seek in vainWhat lands to till or sow with seed -The land is black with briar and weed,Nor cares for falling tears or rain.Thou knowest all; I sit and waitWith blinded eyes and hands that fail,Till the last lifting of the veilAnd the first opening of the gate.Thou knowest all; I cannot see.I trust I shall not live in vain,I know that we shall meet againIn some divine eternity.","Lady Bracknell: Is this Miss Prism a female of repellent aspect, remotely connected with education?Chasuble: (Somewhat indignantly) She is the most cultivated of ladies, and the very picture of respectability.Lady Bracknell: It is obviously the same person.","Ah!

You may come and look at it with me, if you care to.","It is not he who is revealed by the painter; it is rather the painter, who on the coloured canvas, reveals himself.","in every pleasure, cruelty has its place...","The value of an idea has nothing to do with the honesty of the man expressing it.","LORD GORING: (after a long pause) Nobody is incapable of doing a foolish thing. Nobody is incapable of doing a wrong thing.","For Man\'s grim Justice goes its way, And will not swerve aside: It slays the weak, it slays the strong, It has a deadly stride: With iron heel it slays the strong, The monstrous parricide!","For the canons of good society are, or should be, the same as the canons of art. Form is absolutely essential to it. It should have the dignity of a ceremony, as well as its unreality, and should combine the insincere character of a romantic play with the wit and beauty that make such plays delightful to us.","Laughter is not at all a bad beginning for a friendship, and it is far the best ending for one,\\" said the young lord, plucking another daisy.","Up to the present man has hardly cultivated sympathy at all. He has merely sympathy with pain, and sympathy with pain is not the highest form of sympathy. All sympathy is fine, but sympathy with suffering is the least fine mode. It is tainted with egotism. It is apt to become morbid. There is in it a certain element of terror for our own safety. We become afraid that we ourselves might be as the leper or as the blind, and that no man would have care of us. It is curiously limiting, too. One should sympathise with the entirety of life, not with life\'s sores and maladies merely, but with life\'s joy and beauty and energy and health and freedom.","Oh! talk to every woman as if you loved her and to every man as if he bored you, and at the end of your first season you will have the reputation of possessing the most perfect social tact.","The body sins once, and has done with its sin, for action is a mode of purification. Nothing remains then but the recollection of a pleasure, or the luxury of a regret. The only way to get rid of a temptation is to yield to it. Resist it, and your soul grows sick with longing for the things it has forbidden to itself, with desire for what its monstrous laws have made monstrous and unlawful.","Dale una m\xe1scara a un hombre y te dir\xe1 la verdad","Laughter is not at all a bad beginning for a friendship, and it is far the best ending for one, said the young lord, plucking another daisy.Hallward shook his head. \u201cYou don\u2019t understand what friendship is, Harry,\u201d he murmured -\u201dor what enmity is, for that matter. You like everyone; that is to say, you are indifferent to everyone.\u201d","Genie w\xe4hrt l\xe4nger als Sch\xf6nheit.","There is much to be said in favour of modern journalism. By giving us the opinions of the uneducated, it keeps us in touch with the ignorance of the community","A cold rain began to fall, and the blurred street-lamps looked ghastly in the dripping mist.","Don\'t spoil him. Don\'t try to influence him. Your influence would be bad. The world is wide and has many marvellous people in it. Don\'t take away from me the one person who gives to my art whatever charm that possesses: my life as an artist depends on him.","They take their punishment so well, so cheerfully: I go out with an adder in my heart, and an asp in my tongue, and every night I sow thorns in the garden of my soul.","Life is short, art is infinite.","Sweet rains fall on just and unjust alike","I don\'t think now that people can be divided into the good and the bad, as though they were two separate races or creations. What are called good women may have terrible things in them, mad moods of recklessness, assertion, jealousy, sin. Bad women. as they are termed, may have in them sorrow, repentence, pity, sacrifice.","Besides, women were better suited to bear sorrow than men. They lived on their emotions. They only thought of their emotions. When they took lovers, it was merely to have some one with whom they could have scenes.","One should not look at anything. Neither at things, nor at people should one look. Only in mirrors is it well to look, for mirrors do but show us masks.","Cada impulso que intentamos aniquilar germina en la mente y nos envenena","It is safer to beg than to take, but it is finer to take than to beg.","There is a great deal to be said in favour of reading a novel backwards. The last page is as a rule the most interesting, and when one begins with the catastrophe or the d\xe9nouement one feels on pleasant terms of equality with the author. It is like going behind the scenes of a theatre. One is no longer taken in, and the hair-breadth escapes of the hero and the wild agonies of the heroine leave one absolutely unmoved. One knows the jealously guarded secret, and one can afford to smile at the quite unnecessary anxiety that the puppets of fiction always consider it their duty to display.","Ah, Iokanaan, Iokanaan, thou wert the man that I loved alone among men! All other men were hateful to me. But thou wert beautiful! Thy body was a column of ivory set upon feet of silver. It was a garden full of doves and lilies of silver. It was a tower of silver decked with shields of ivory. There was nothing in the world so white as thy body. There was nothing in the world so black as thy hair. In the whole world there was nothing so red as thy mouth. Thy voice was a censer that scattered strange perfumes, and when I looked on thee I heard a strange music. Ah! wherefore didst thou not look at me, Iokanaan?","I wish i could write them down, these little coloured parables or poems that live for a moment in some cell of my brain, and then leave it to go wandering elsewhere. I hate writing; the mere act of writing a thing down is troublesome to me. I want some fine medium, and look for it in vain.","We lose too soon, and only find delightIn withered husks of some dead memory.","For his mourners will be outcast menAnd outcasts always mourn...","If a man is a gentleman, he knows quite enough, and if he is not a gentleman, whatever he knows is bad for him.","The public is largely influenced by the look of a book. So are we all. It is the only artistic thing about the public.","Besides, if Hans came here, he might ask me to let him have some flour on credit, and that I could not do. Flour is one thing, and friendship is another, and they should not be confused. Why, the words are spelled differently, and mean quite different things. Everyone can see that.","He has certainly not been paying me compliments. Perhaps that is thereason that I don\'t believe anything he has told me.","The wind shook some blossoms from the trees, and the heavy lilac blooms, with their clustering stars, moved to and fro in the languid air. A grasshopper began to chirp by the wall, and like a blue thread a long, thin dragonfly floated past on its brown gauze wings. Lord Henry felt as if he could hear Basil Hallward\'s heart beating, and wondered what was coming.","Algernon.\xa0 Then your wife will.\xa0 You don\u2019t seem to realise, that in married life three is company and two is none. Jack.\xa0 [Sententiously.]\xa0 That, my dear young friend, is the theory that the corrupt French Drama has been propounding for the last fifty years. Algernon.\xa0 Yes; and that the happy English home has proved in half the time. Jack.\xa0 For heaven\u2019s sake, don\u2019t try to be cynical.\xa0 It\u2019s perfectly easy to be cynical. Algernon.\xa0 My dear fellow, it isn\u2019t easy to be anything nowadays.\xa0 There\u2019s such a lot of beastly competition about.","One should never take sides in anything, Mr. Kelvil. Taking sides is the beginning of sincerity, and earnestness follows shortly afterwards, and the human being becomes a bore.","The critic will certainly be an interpreter, but he will not treat Art as a riddling Sphinx, whose shallow secret may be guessed and revealed by one whose feet are wounded and who knows not his name. Rather, he will look upon Art as a goddess whose mystery it is his province to intensify, and whose majesty his privilege to make more marvellous in the eyes of men.","For the future let those who come to play with me have no hearts,\' she cried, and she ran out into the garden.","\u062b\u0645\u0629 \u0634\u064a\u0621 \u0641\u064a \u0648\u062c\u0647\u0647 \u064a\u062c\u0639\u0644\u0643 \u062a\u062b\u0642 \u0628\u0647 \u0639\u0644\u0649 \u0627\u0644\u0641\u0648\u0631\u060c \u0643\u0623\u0646 \u0647\u0630\u0627 \u0627\u0644\u0641\u062a\u0649 \u0638\u064e\u0644\u064e\u0651 \u0641\u064a \u0645\u0639\u0632\u0644 \u0639\u0646 \u0622\u062b\u0627\u0645 \u0627\u0644\u0639\u0627\u0644\u0645.","I am all expectation.","She began to complain. Women defend themselves by attacking, just as they attack by sudden and strange surrenders.","The man who sees both sides of a question is a man who sees absolutely nothing.","Poets are not so scrupulous as you are. They know how useful passion is for publication. Nowadays a broken heart will run to many editions.","Mi bella Princesa, your funny little dwarf will never dance again. It is a pity, for he is so ugly that he might have made the King smile.\'\'But why will he not dance again?\' asked the Infanta, laughing.\'Because his heart is broken,\' answered the Chamberlain.And the Infanta frowned, and her dainty rose-leaf lips curled in pretty disdain. \'For the future let those who come to play with me have no hearts,\' she cried, and she ran out into the garden.","I am less to you than your ivory Hermes or your silver Faun. You will like them always. How long will you like me? Till I have my first wrinkle, I suppose. I know, now, that when one loses one\'s good looks, whatever they may be, one loses everything. Your picture has taught me that. Lord Henry Wotton is perfectly right. Youth is the only thing worth having. When I find that I am growing old, I shall kill myself.","Ordinary people waited till life disclosed to them its secrets, but to the few, to the elect, the mysteries of life were revealed before the veil was drawn away.","Nothing really at any period of my life was ever of the smallest importance to me compared with Art. But in the case of an artist, weakness is nothing less than a crime, when it is a weakness that paralyses the imagination","Women have no appreciation of good looks-at least, good women have not.","\xbfDebe la alegr\xeda vestirse con lo que fabrico el Dolor?","That certainly seems a satisfactory explanation, does it not?\u2013 Yes dear, if you can believe him.\u2013 I don\'t. But that does not affect the wonderful beauty of his answer.","Mere words.. Was there anything so real as words?","The more he knew, the more he desired to know. He had mad hungers that grew more ravenous as he fed them.","It was only in the theatre that I lived.","When I like people immensely I never tell their names to anyone. It is like surrendering a part of them. I have grown to love secrecy. It seems to be the only thing that can make modern life mysterious or marvellous to us. The commonest thing is delightful if one only hides it.","I don\'t like novels that end happily. They depress me so much.","My first impressions of people are invariably right.","Oh! Anything becomes a pleasure if one does it too often.","Oh my dear fellow...should you not be askind, \'Would the tea like the cup?","An artist should create beautiful things, but should put nothing of his own life into them. We live in an age when men treat art as if it were meant to be a form of autobiography. We have lost the abstract sense of beauty. Some day I will show the world what it is; and for that reason the world shall never see my portrait of Dorian Gray.","What a laugh she had!--just like a thrush singing. And how pretty she had been in her cotton dresses and her large hats! She knew nothing, but she had everything that he had lost.","The true artist is a man who believes absolutely in himself, because he is absolutely himself.","There was something in his face that made one trust him at once. All the candour of youth was there, as well as youth\'s passionate purity. One felt that he had kept himself unspotted from the world.","To tell people what to read is, as a rule, either useless or harmful; for the appreciation of literature is a question of temperament not of teaching; to Parnassus there is no primer and nothing that one can learn is ever worth learning.","But it appeared to Dorian Gray that the true nature of the senses had never been understood, and that they had remained savage and animal merely because the world had sought to stave them into submission or to kill them by pain, instead of aiming at making them elements of a new spirituality, of which a fine instinct for beauty was to be the dominant characteristic.","the secrets of art are best learned in secret, and that Beauty, like Wisdom, loves the lonely worshipper.","I would sooner say, or hear it said of me, that I was so typical a child of my age, that in my perversity, and for that perversity`s sake, I turned the good things of my life to evil, and the evil things of my life to good.","The man who says his wife can\'t take a joke, forgets she took him.","Forty is the old age of youth; fifty is the youth of old age.","In this world there are only two tragedies. One is not getting what one wants, and the other is getting it. The last is much the worst; the last is a real tragedy!","To recommend thrift to the poor is both grotesque and insulting. It is like advising a man who is starving to eat less.","The real tragedies of life occur in such an inartistic manner that they hurt us by their crude violence, their absolute incoherence, their absurd want of meaning, their entire lack of style.","When one is in love, one always begins by deceiving one\'s self, and one always ends by deceiving others.","I can sympathize with everything except suffering,\\" said Lord Henry, shrugging his shoulders. \\"I cannot sympathize with that. It is too ugly, too horrible, too distressing. There is something terribly morbid in the modern sympathy with pain. One should sympathize with the colour, the beauty, the joy of life.

Indeed I am not sure that I quite know what Pessimism really means. All I do know is that life cannot be understood without much charity, it cannot be lived without much charity. It is love, and not German philosophy, that is the true explanation of this world, whatever may be the explanation of the next.","Pinkerton\'s Champion Stain Remover and Paragon Detergent","By the way, Dorian, he (Lord Henry) said, after a pause, what does it profit a man if he gain the whole world and lose - how does the quotation run? - his own soul?","My dear Hiram,\\" cried Mrs. Otis, \\"what can we do with a woman who faints?\\" \\"Charge it to her like breakages,\\" answered the Minister; \\"she won\'t faint after that;","JACK.I am sick to death of cleverness.

I turned half-way round and saw Dorian Gray for the first time. When our eyes met, I felt that I was growing pale. A curious sensation of terror came over me. I knew that I had come face to face with some one whose mere personality was so fascinating that, if I allowed it to do so, it would absorb my whole nature, my whole soul, my very art itself.","These days man knows the price of everything but the value of nothing.","Yet, as has been said of him before, no theory of life seemed to him to be of any importance compared with life itself. He felt keenly conscious of how barren all intellectual speculation is when separated from action and experiment.

The praise of folly, as he went on, soared into a philosophy, and Philosophy herself became young, and catching the mad music of Pleasure, wearing, one might fancy, her wine-stained robe and wreath of ivy, danced like a bacchante over the hills of life, and mocked the slow Silenus for being sober. Facts fled before her like frightened forest things. Her white feet trod the huge press at which wise Omar sits, till the seething grape-juice rose round her bare limbs in waves of purple bubbles, or crawled in red foam over the vat\u2019s black, dripping, sloping sides.","Men marry because they are tired, women because they are curious.

It was only in the theatre that I lived. I thought that it was all true. I was Rosalind one night and Portia the other. The joy of Beatrice was my joy, and the sorrows of Cordelia were mine also. I believed in everything. The common people who acted with me seemed to me to be godlike. The painted scenes were my world. I knew nothing but shadows, and I thought them real. You came\u2014oh, my beautiful love!\u2014 and you freed my soul from prison. You taught me what reality really is. To-night, for the first time in my life, I saw through the hollowness, the sham, the silliness of the empty pageant in which I had always played. To-night, for the first time, I became conscious that the Romeo was hideous, and old, and painted, that the moonlight in the orchard was false, that the scenery was vulgar, and that the words I had to speak were unreal, were not my words, were not what I wanted to say. You had brought me something higher, something of which all art is but a reflection.","Ah! it is so easy to convert others. It is so difficult to convert oneself. To arrive at what one really believes, one must speak through lips different from one\'s own. To know the truth one must imagine myriads of falsehoods.","You know how I love secrecy. It is the only thing that can make modern life wonderful or mysterious to us. The commonest thing is delightful if one only hides it.","Ordinary cruelty is simple stupidity. It comes from the entire want of imagination. It is the result in our days of stereotyped systems, of hard-and-fast rules, of centralisation, of officialism, and of irresponsible authority. Whenever there is centralisation there is stupidity. What is inhuman in modern life is officialism. Authority is as destructive to those who exercise it as it is to those on whom it is exercised.","Scelgo i miei amici per la loro bellezza, le mie conoscenze per la loro rispettabilit\xe0, e i miei nemici per la loro intelligenza.","It had brought melancholy across his passions. Its mere memory had marred many moments of joy. It had been like conscience to him. Yes, it had been conscience.

Upon my word, Basil, I didn\'t know you were so vain; and I really can\'t see any resemblance between you, with your rugged strong face and your coal-black hair, and this young Adonis, who looks as if he was made out of ivory and rose-leaves. Why, my dear Basil, he is a Narcissus, and you\u2014 well, of course you have an intellectual expression and all that. But beauty, real beauty, ends where an intellectual expression begins. Intellect is in itself a mode of exaggeration, and destroys the harmony of any face. The moment one sits down to think, one becomes all nose, or all forehead, or something horrid. Look at the successful men in any of the learned professions. How perfectly hideous they are! Except, of course, in the Church. But then in the Church they don\'t think. A bishop keeps on saying at the age of eighty what he was told to say when he was a boy of eighteen, and as a natural consequence he always looks absolutely delightful. Your mysterious young friend, whose name you have never told me, but whose picture really fascinates me, never thinks. I feel quite sure of that. He is some brainless beautiful creature who should be always here in winter when we have no flowers to look at, and always here in summer when we want something to chill our intelligence. Don\'t flatter yourself, Basil: you are not in the least like him.","He seems to read nothing but my books, and says his one desire is to \'follow in my footsteps\'! But I have told him that they lead to terrible places.","Every day. I couldn\'t be happy if I didn\'t see him every day. He is absolutely necessary to me.","Hoy en d\xeda la gente conoce el precio de todo y el valor de nada.","Those who find ugly meanings in beautiful things are corrupt without being charming. This is a fault. Those who find beautiful meanings in beautiful things are the cultivated. For these there are hope.","truth is rarely pure and never simple.","Disobedience, in the eyes of anyone who has read history, is man\'s original virtue. It is through disobedience that progress has been made, through disobedience and through rebellion. Sometimes the poor are praised for being thrifty. But to recommend thrift to the poor is both grotesque and insulting. It is likeadvising a man who is starving to eat less. For a town and countrylaborer to practice thrift would be absolutely immoral. Man shouldnot be ready to show that he can live like a badly fed animal. Heshould decline to live like that, and should either steal or go onthe rates, which is considered by many to be a form of stealing. As for begging, it is safer to beg than to take, but it is finer totake than to beg. No: a poor man who is ungrateful, unthrifty, discontented and rebellious, is probably a real personality, and has much to him. He is at any rate a healthy protest. As for the virtuous poor, one can pitythem, of course, but one cannot possibly admire them. They have made privateterms with the enemy, and sold their birthright for very bad pottage.","The worst vice of a fanatic is his sincerity.","The moral life of man forms part of the subject matter of the artist, but the morality of art consists in the perfect use of an imperfect medium.","Jack: [Slowly and hesitatingly] \u201cGwendolen\u2013Cecily\u2013it is very painful for me to be forced to speak the truth. It is the first time in my life that I have ever been reduced to such a painful position, and I am really quite inexperienced in doing anything of the kind.","One\'s days were too brief to take the burden of another\'s errors on one\'s shoulders.","Lady Bracknell: \u201cHe was eccentric, I admit. But only in later years. And that was the result of the Indian climate, and marriage, and indigestion, and other things of that kind.","The only real people are the people who never existed, and if a novelist is base enough to go to life for his personages he should at least pretend that they are creations, and not boast of them as copies.","He felt that he had known them all, those strange terrible figures that had passed across the stage of the world and made sin so marvelous and evil so full of subtlety.","I fancy that the true explanation is this: It often happens that the real tragedies of life occur in such an inartistic manner that they hurt us by their crude violence, their absolute incoherence, their absurd want of meaning, their entire lack of style. They affect us just as vulgarity affects us. They give us an impression of sheer brute force, and we revolt against that. Sometimes, however, a tragedy that possesses artistic elements of beauty crosses our lives. If these elements of beauty are real, the whole thing simply appeals to our sense of dramatic effect. Suddenly we find that we are no longer the actors, but the spectators of the play. Or rather we are both. We watch ourselves, and the mere wonder of the spectacle enthralls us. In the present case, what is it that has really happened? Some one has killed herself for love of you. I wish that I had ever had such an experience. It would have made me in love with love for the rest of my life. The people who have adored me\u2014there have not been very many, but there have been some\u2014have always insisted on living on, long after I had ceased to care for them, or they to care for me. They have become stout and tedious, and when I meet them, they go in at once for reminiscences. That awful memory of woman! What a fearful thing it is! And what an utter intellectual stagnation it reveals! One should absorb the colour of life, but one should never remember its details. Details are always vulgar.","I should fancy that crime was to them what art is to us, simply a method of procuring extraordinary sensations.","Saat \xfc\xe7\xfc vurdu, d\xf6rd\xfc vurdu, d\xf6rt bu\xe7u\u011fu vurdu ama o yerinden k\u0131m\u0131ldamad\u0131.

Something was dead within each of us, And what was dead was Hope.","No, she will never come to life. She has played her last part. But you must think of that lonely death in the tawdry dressing-room simply as a strange lurid fragment from some Jacobean tragedy, as a wonderful scene from Webster, or Ford, or Cyril Tourneur. The girl never really lived, and so she has never really died. To you at least she was always a dream, a phantom that flitted through Shakespeare\'s plays and left them lovelier for its presence, a reed through which Shakespeare\'s music sounded richer and more full of joy. The moment she touched actual life, she marred it, and it marred her, and so she passed away. Mourn for Ophelia, if you like. Put ashes on your head because Cordelia was strangled. Cry out against Heaven because the daughter of Brabantio died. But don\'t waste your tears over Sibyl Vane. She was less real than they are.","More than half of modern culture depends on what one shouldn\u2019t read.","People who shout so loud, my lords, do nothing; the only men I fear are silent men","Practice precedes perfection.","Crime belongs exclusively to the lower orders. I don\'t blame them in the smallest degree. I should fancy that crime is to them what art is to us, simply a method of procuring extraordinary sensations.","Girls never marry the men they flirt with. Girls don\'t think it right.","Yes: the public is wonderfully tolerant.\xa0 It forgives everything except genius.","Besides, nothing makes one so vain as being told that one is a sinner.","Yet ruled he not long, so great had been his suffering, and so bitter the fire of his testing, for after the space of three years he died. And he who came after him ruled evilly.","For romantic young people like he is, the world always looks best at a distance; and a prison where one\'s allowed to order one\'s own dinner is not at all bad.","Don\u2019t speak. Let me think, or, rather, let me try not to think.","He atones for being occasionally somewhat overdressed by being always absolutely over-educated. He is a very modern type.","The fact is, that the public have an insatiable curiosity to know everything, except what is worth knowing.","As for marriage, of course that would be silly, but there are other and more interesting bonds between men and women.","Es perfectamente monstruoso -dijo por fin- la costumbre que tiene la gente hoy d\xeda de hablar a espaldas de uno y decir de \xe9l cosas que son completa y absolutamente ciertas.","I believe that you are really a very good husband but that you are thoroughly ashamed of your own virtues. You are an extraordinary fellow. You never say a moral thing and you never do a wrong thing.

To realize one\'s nature perfectly.","Yes Harry I believe that is true. I cannot help telling you things. You have a curious influence over me. If I ever did a crime I would come and confess it to you. You would understand me.","Women are wonderfully practical,\' murmured Lord Henry, \'much more practical than we are. In situations of that kind we often forget to say anything about marriage, and they always remind us.","Well, I must say, Algernon, that I think it is high time that Mr. Bunbury made up his mind whether he was going to live or to die. This shilly-shallying with the question is absurd. Nor do I in any way approve of the modern sympathy with invalids. I consider it morbid. Illness of any kind is hardly a thing to be encouraged in others. Health is the primary duty of life.","Art is not a thing. It is a way.","But neither milk-white rose nor red May bloom in prison air;The shard, the pebble, and the flint, Are what they give us there:For flowers have been known to heal A common man\'s despair.","Women have a wonderful instinct about things.\xa0 They can discover everything except the obvious.","Describe us as a sex,\\" was her challenge. \\"Sphinxes without secrets.","Do you know I am afraid that good people do a great deal of harm in this world. Certainly the greatest harm they do is that they make badness of such extraordinary importance. It is absurd to divide people into good and bad. People are either charming or tedious.","The separation of spirit from matter was a mystery and the union of spirit with matter was a mystery also.","And unselfish people are colourless. They lack individuality.","It is the spectator, and not life, that art really mirrors.","the value of an idea has nothing whatsoever to do with the sincerity of the man who expresses it.","Why didn\'t you tell me that the only thing worth loving is an actress?","I keep a diary in order to enter the wonderful secrets of my life.

The world is made by it, and yet the world cannot understand it: that is because the imagination is simply a manifestation of love, and it is love and the capacity for it that distinguishes one human being from another.","Terrible as was what the world did to me, what I did to myself was far more terrible still.","Yes; she is a peacock in everything but beauty,","Secret to remain young is to have an inordinate passion for pleasure.","Romance lives by repetition, and repetition converts an appetite into an art. Besides, each time that one loves is the only time one has ever loved. Difference of object does not alter singleness of passion. It merely intensifies it. We can have in life but one great experience at best, and the secret of life is to reproduce that experience as often as possible.\\" \\"Even when one has been wounded by it, Harry?\\" asked the duchess after a pause. \\"Especially when one has been wounded by it,\\" answered Lord Henry.","Diversity of opinion about a work of art shows that the work is new, complex, and vital.","People cry out against the sinner, yet it is not the sinful, but the stupid, who are our shame. There is no sin except stupidity.","It is only an auctioneer who should admire all schools of art.","It is very vulgar to talk about one\'s business.","artists have sex but art has none","Anything approaching an explanation is always derogatory to a work of art.","Indeed, as a rule, everybody turns out to be somebody else.","When I see a spade I call it a spade.I\'m glad to say I have never seen a spade!","It would be unfair to expect other people to be as brilliant as oneself.","Wishing to make an effective entrance, he flung it wide open, when a heavy jug of water fell right down on him, wetting him to the skin, and just missing his left shoulder by a couple of inches. At the same moment he heard stifled shrieks of laughter proceeding from the four-post bed.","What has the actual lapse of time got to do with it? It is only shallow people who require years to get rid of an emotion. A man who is master of himself can end a sorrow as easily as he can invent a pleasure. I don\'t want to be at the mercy of my emotions. I want to use them, to enjoy them, and to dominate them.","In war,\u2019 answered the weaver, \u2018the strong make slaves of the weak, and in peace the rich make slaves of the poor.","To get back one\'s youth, one has merely to repeat one\'s follies.\\" \\"A delightful theory!\\" she exclaimed. \\"I must put it into practice.\\" \\"A dangerous theory!\\" came from Sir Thomas\'s tight lips.

Each man lived his own life, and paid his own price for living it. The only pity was one had to pay so often for a single fault. One had to pay over and over again, indeed.

To a large extent the lad was his own creation. He had made him premature. That was something. Ordinary people waited till life disclosed to them its secrets, but to the few, to the elect, the mysteries of life were revealed before the veil was drawn away. Sometimes this was the effect of art, and chiefly of the art of literature, which dealt immediately with the passions and the intellect. But now and then a complex personality took the place and assumed the office of art, was indeed, in its way, a real work of art, life having its elaborate masterpieces, just as poetry has, or sculpture, or painting.","Like all good reputations... every effect that one produces gives one an enemy.

The critic is he who can translate into another manner or a new material his impression of beautiful things. The highest as the lowest form of criticism is a mode of autobiography. Those who find ugly meanings in beautiful things are corrupt without being charming. This is a fault. Those who find beautiful meanings in beautiful things are the cultivated. For these there is hope. They are the elect to whom beautiful things mean only beauty. There is no such thing as a moral or an immoral book. Books are well written, or badly written. That is all.","Os calculistas, aqueles que v\xeaem a vida como um jogo de ast\xfacia que depende de uma cuidadosa avalia\xe7\xe3o de modos e meios, sempre sabem para onde est\xe3o indo e conseguem chegar l\xe1.

His whole conception of Humanity sprang right out of the imagination and can only be realised by it. What God was to the pantheist, man was to Him. He was the first to conceive the divided races as a unity. Before his time there had been gods and men, and, feeling through the mysticism of sympathy that in himself each had been made incarnate, he calls himself the Son of the one or the Son of the other, according to his mood. More than any one else in history he wakes in us that temper of wonder to which romance always appeals.","He did not wring his hands, as doThose witless men who dareTo try to rear the changeling HopeIn the cave of black Despair.","The only real people are the people who never existed, and if a novelist is base enough to go to life for his personages he should at least pretend that they are creations, and not boast of them as copies.

In his own entreaty to the young man, \'Sell all that thou hast and give to the poor,\' it is not of the state of the poor that he is thinking but of the soul of the young man, the soul that wealth was marring. In his view of life he is one with the artist who knows that by the inevitable law of self-perfection, the poet must sing, and the sculptor think in bronze, and the painter make the world a mirror for his moods, as surely and as certainly as the hawthorn must blossom in spring, and the corn turn to gold at harvest-time, and the moon in her ordered wanderings change from shield to sickle, and from sickle to shield.","The fact is that we look back on the ages entirely through the medium of Art, and Art, very fortunately, has never once told us the truth.","Really the answers I get are idiotic.

It is something that has dwelt in fearful places, and in ancient sepulchres has made its abode. It is sick with many maladies, and has memories of curious sins. It is wiser than we are, and its wisdom is bitter. It fills us with impossible desires, and makes us follow what we know we cannot gain. One thing, however, Ernest, it can do for us. It can lead us away from surroundings whose beauty is dimmed to us by the mist of familiarity, or whose ignoble ugliness and sordid claims are marring the perfection of our development. It can help us to leave the age in which we were born, and to pass into other ages, and find ourselves not exiled from their air. It can teach us how to escape from our experience, and to realise the experiences of those who are greater than we are. The pain of Leopardi crying out against life becomes our pain. Theocritus blows on his pipe, and we laugh with the lips of nymph and shepherd. In the wolfskin of Pierre Vidal we flee before the hounds, and in the armour of Lancelot we ride from the bower of the Queen. We have whispered the secret of our love beneath the cowl of Abelard, and in the stained raiment of Villon have put our shame into song. We can see the dawn through Shelley\'s eyes, and when we wander with Endymion the Moon grows amorous of our youth. Ours is the anguish of Atys, and ours the weak rage and noble sorrows of the Dane. Do you think that it is the imagination that enables us to live these countless lives? Yes: it is the imagination; and the imagination is the result of heredity.

In the case of the novel and the drama, arts in which the public do take an interest, the result of the exercise of popular authority has been absolutely ridiculous. No country produces such badly-written fiction, such tedious, common work in the novel form, such silly, vulgar plays as England. It must necessarily be so. The popular standard is of such a character that no artist can get to it. It is at once too easy and too difficult to be a popular novelist. It is too easy, because the requirements of the public as far as plot, style, psychology, treatment of life, and treatment of literature are concerned are within the reach of the very meanest capacity and the most uncultivated mind. It is too difficult, because to meet such requirements the artist would have to do violence to his temperament, would have to write not for the artistic joy of writing, but for the amusement of half-educated people, and so would have to suppress his individualism, forget his culture, annihilate his style, and surrender everything that is valuable in him.","The commonest thing is delightful if only one hides it.","Moral grounds are always the last refuge of people who have no sense of beauty.","I await the revises, and promise you not to \'make my quietus with a bare bodkin\' till I have returned them.

And perhaps it is a good thing for most of us that it is not.","The heart contains passion but the imagination alone contains poetry,\u2019 says Charles Baudelaire. This too was the lesson that Theophile Gautier, most subtle of all modern critics, most fascinating of all modern poets, was never tired of teaching - \u2018Everybody is affected by a sunrise or a sunset.\u2019 The absolute distinction of the artist is not his capacity to feel nature so much as his power of rendering it. The entire subordination of all intellectual and emotional faculties to the vital and informing poetic principle is the surest sign of the strength of our Renaissance.","Ehrgeiz ist die letzte Zuflucht des Versagers","Yet one had ancestors in literature as well as in one\'s own race, nearer perhaps in type and temperament, many of them, and certainly with an influence of which one was more absolutely conscious.","I had come face to face with some one whose mere personality was so fascinating that, if I allowed it to do so, it would absorb my whole nature, my whole soul, my very art itself.","Unconsciously he defines for me the lines of a fresh new school, a school that is to have in it all the passion of the romantic spirit, all the perfection of the spirit that is Greek. The harmony of soul and body - how much that is! We in our madness have separated the two, and have invented a realism that is vulgar, an ideality that is void. Harry! If only you knew what Dorian Gray is to me!","Then I feel, Harry, that I have given away my whole soul to some one who treats it as if it were a flower to put in his coat, a bit of decoration to charm his vanity, an ornament for a summer\'s day.","What on earth you are serious about I haven\u2019t got the remotest idea.\xa0 About everything, I should fancy.\xa0 You have such an absolutely trivial nature.","Nor do I in any way approve of the modern sympathy with invalids.\xa0 I consider it morbid.\xa0 Illness of any kind is hardly a thing to be encouraged in others.","People used to say of me that I was too individualistic. I must be far more of an individualist than ever I was. I must get far more out of myself than ever I got, and ask far less of the world than ever I asked. Indeed, my ruin came not from too great individualism of life, but from too little. The one disgraceful, unpardonable, and to all time contemptible action of my life was to allow myself to appeal to society for help and protection.","We are not sent into the world to air our moral prejudices.","To live is the rarest thing in the world.

It seems to me that we all look at Nature too much, and live with her too little.","Selfishness is not living as one wishes to live, it is asking others to live as one wishes to live: and unselfishness is letting other people\'s lives alone, not interfering with them.","And beauty is a form of genius--is higher, indeed, than genius, as it needs no explanation. It is of the great facts of the world, like sunlight, or spring-time, or the reflection in dark waters of that silver shell we call the moon. It cannot be questioned. It has its divine right of sovereignty. It makes princes of those who have it. You smile? Ah! when you have lost it you won\'t smile.... People say sometimes that beauty is only superficial. That may be so, but at least it is not so superficial as thought is. To me, beauty is the wonder of wonders. It is only shallow people who do not judge by appearances. The true mystery of the world is the visible, not the invisible.... Yes, Mr. Gray, the gods have been good to you. But what the gods give they quickly take away. You have only a few years in which to live really, perfectly, and fully. When your youth goes, your beauty will go with it, and then you will suddenly discover that there are no triumphs left for you, or have to content yourself with those mean triumphs that the memory of your past will make more bitter than defeats. Every month as it wanes brings you nearer to something dreadful. Time is jealous of you, and wars against your lilies and your roses. You will become sallow, and hollow-cheeked, and dull-eyed. You will suffer horribly.... Ah! realize your youth while you have it. Don\'t squander the gold of your days, listening to the tedious, trying to improve the hopeless failure, or giving away your life to the ignorant, the common, and the vulgar. These are the sickly aims, the false ideals, of our age. Live! Live the wonderful life that is in you! Let nothing be lost upon you. Be always searching for new sensations. Be afraid of nothing.... A new Hedonism--that is what our century wants. You might be its visible symbol. With your personality there is nothing you could not do. The world belongs to you for a season.... The moment I met you I saw that you were quite unconscious of what you really are, of what you really might be. There was so much in you that charmed me that I felt I must tell you something about yourself. I thought how tragic it would be if you were wasted. For there is such a little time that your youth will last--such a little time. The common hill-flowers wither, but they blossom again. The laburnum will be as yellow next June as it is now. In a month there will be purple stars on the clematis, and year after year the green night of its leaves will hold its purple stars. But we never get back our youth. The pulse of joy that beats in us at twenty becomes sluggish. Our limbs fail, our senses rot. We degenerate into hideous puppets, haunted by the memory of the passions of which we were too much afraid, and the exquisite temptations that we had not the courage to yield to. Youth! Youth!

He realised in the entire sphere of human relations that imaginative sympathy which in the sphere of Art is the sole secret of creation. He understood the leprosy of the leper, the darkness of the blind, the fierce misery of those who live for pleasure, the strange poverty of the rich. Someone wrote to me in trouble, \'When you are not on your pedestal you are not interesting.\' How remote was the writer from what Matthew Arnold calls \'the Secret of Jesus.\' Either would have taught him that whatever happens to another happens to oneself, and if you want an inscription to read at dawn and at night-time, and for pleasure or for pain, write up on the walls of your house in letters for the sun to gild and the moon to silver, \'Whatever happens to oneself happens to another.","When I am in trouble, eating is the only thing that consoles me.

You were always afraid of a shower, Just like a flower: I remember you started and ran When the rain began. I remember I never could catch you, For no one could match you, You had wonderful, luminous, fleet, Little wings to your feet. I remember your hair - did I tie it? For it always ran riot - Like a tangled sunbeam of gold: These things are old. I remember so well the room, And the lilac bloom That beat at the dripping pane In the warm June rain; And the colour of your gown, It was amber-brown, And two yellow satin bows From your shoulders rose. And the handkerchief of French lace Which you held to your face - Had a small tear left a stain? Or was it the rain? On your hand as it waved adieu There were veins of blue; In your voice as it said good-bye Was a petulant cry, \'You have only wasted your life.\' (Ah, that was the knife!)

It lies at the base of all noble, realistic and romantic work as opposed to the colourless and empty abstractions of our own eighteenth-century poets and of the classical dramatists of France, or of the vague spiritualities of the German sentimental school: opposed, too, to that spirit of transcendentalism which also was root and flower itself of the great Revolution, underlying the impassioned contemplation of Wordsworth and giving wings and fire to the eagle- like flight of Shelley, and which in the sphere of philosophy, though displaced by the materialism and positiveness of our day, bequeathed two great schools of thought, the school of Newman to Oxford, the school of Emerson to America. Yet is this spirit of transcendentalism alien to the spirit of art. For the artist can accept no sphere of life in exchange for life itself. For him there is no escape from the bondage of the earth: there is not even the desire of escape. He is indeed the only true realist: symbolism, which is the essence of the transcendental spirit, is alien to him. The metaphysical mind of Asia will create for itself the monstrous, many-breasted idol of Ephesus, but to the Greek, pure artist, that work is most instinct with spiritual life which conforms most clearly to the perfect facts of physical life.","The supreme object of life is to live.

Byron was a rebel and Shelley a dreamer; but in the calmness and clearness of his vision, his perfect self-control, his unerring sense of beauty and his recognition of a separate realm for the imagination, Keats was the pure and serene artist, the forerunner of the pre-Raphaelite school, and so of the great romantic movement of which I am to speak.","I am afraid it is quite clear, Cecily, that neither of us is engaged to be married to any one.","Cuando somos felices siempre somos buenos, pero cuando somos buenos no siempre somos felices","\u039f\u03b9 \u03c0\u03b5\u03c1\u03b9\u03c3\u03c3\u03cc\u03c4\u03b5\u03c1\u03bf\u03b9 \u03ac\u03bd\u03b8\u03c1\u03c9\u03c0\u03bf\u03b9 \u03b5\u03af\u03bd\u03b1\u03b9 \u03ac\u03bb\u03bb\u03bf\u03b9 \u03ac\u03bd\u03b8\u03c1\u03c9\u03c0\u03bf\u03b9.\u039f\u03b9 \u03c3\u03ba\u03ad\u03c8\u03b5\u03b9\u03c2 \u03c4\u03bf\u03c5\u03c2 \u03b5\u03af\u03bd\u03b1\u03b9 \u03bf\u03b9 \u03b1\u03c0\u03cc\u03c8\u03b5\u03b9\u03c2 \u03ba\u03ac\u03c0\u03bf\u03b9\u03bf\u03c5 \u03ac\u03bb\u03bb\u03bf\u03c5,\u03b7 \u03b6\u03c9\u03ae \u03c4\u03bf\u03c5\u03c2 \u03bc\u03b9\u03b1 \u03bc\u03af\u03bc\u03b7\u03c3\u03b7,\u03c4\u03b1 \u03c0\u03ac\u03b8\u03b7 \u03c4\u03bf\u03c5\u03c2 \u03ad\u03bd\u03b1 \u03c1\u03b7\u03c4\u03cc.","Cuando uno est\xe1 enamorado, siempre comienza enga\xf1\xe1ndose a s\xed mismo y termina enga\xf1ando a otros.

For it is not enough that a work of art should conform to the aesthetic demands of its age: there must be also about it, if it is to affect us with any permanent delight, the impress of a distinct individuality, an individuality remote from that of ordinary men, and coming near to us only by virtue of a certain newness and wonder in the work, and through channels whose very strangeness makes us more ready to give them welcome.","When your youth goes, your beauty will go with it, and then you will suddenly discover that there are no triumphs left for you, or have to content yourself with those mean triumphs that the memory of your past will make more bitter than defeats.","We are punished for our refusals.

There was animalism in the soul, and the body had its moments of spirituality. The senses could refine, and the intellect could degrade. Who could say where the fleshly impulse ceased, or the psychical impulse began? How shallow were the arbitrary definitions of ordinary psychologists! And yet how difficult to decide between the claims of the various schools! Was the soul a shadow seated in the house of sin? Or was the body really in the soul, as Giordano Bruno thought? The separation of spirit from matter was a mystery, and the union of spirit with matter was a mystery also.","And so it is in poetry also: all this love of curious French metres like the Ballade, the Villanelle, the Rondel; all this increased value laid on elaborate alliterations, and on curious words and refrains, such as you will find in Dante Rossetti and Swinburne, is merely the attempt to perfect flute and viol and trumpet through which the spirit of the age and the lips of the poet may blow the music of their many messages. And so it has been with this romantic movement of ours: it is a reaction against the empty conventional workmanship, the lax execution of previous poetry and painting, showing itself in the work of such men as Rossetti and Burne-Jones by a far greater splendour of colour, a far more intricate wonder of design than English imaginative art has shown before. In Rossetti\u2019s poetry and the poetry of Morris, Swinburne and Tennyson a perfect precision and choice of language, a style flawless and fearless, a seeking for all sweet and precious melodies and a sustaining consciousness of the musical value of each word are opposed to that value which is merely intellectual. In this respect they are one with the romantic movement of France of which not the least characteristic note was struck by Theophile Gautier\u2019s advice to the young poet to read his dictionary every day, as being the only book worth a poet\u2019s reading.","Most people live for love and admiration. But it is by love and admiration that we should live. If any love is shown us we should recognise that we are quite unworthy of it. Nobody is worthy to be loved. The fact that God loves man shows us that in the divine order of ideal things it is written that eternal love is to be given to what is eternally unworthy. Or if that phrase seems to be a bitter one to bear, let us say that every one is worthy of love, except him who thinks that he is. Love is a sacrament that should be taken kneeling, and Domine, non sum dignus should be on the lips and in the hearts of those who receive it.","Shallow sorrows and shallow loves live on... The loves and sorrows that are great are destroyed by their own plentitude.","There are few of us who have not sometimes wakened before dawn, either after one of those dreamless nights that make one almost enamoured of death, or one of those nights of horror and misshapen joy, when through the chambers of the brain sweep phantoms more terrible than reality itself, and instinct with that vivid life that lurks in all grotesques, and that lends to Gothic art its enduring vitality, this art being, one might fancy, especially the art of those whose minds have been troubled with the malady of revery. Gradually white fingers creep through the curtains, and they appear to tremble. Black fantastic shadows crawl into the corners of the room, and crouch there. Outside, there is the stirring of birds among the leaves, or the sound of men going forth to their work, or the sigh and sob of the wind coming down from the hills, and wandering round the silent house, as though it feared to wake the sleepers. Veil after veil of thin dusky gauze is lifted, and by degrees the forms and colors of things are restored to them, and we watch the dawn remaking the world in its antique pattern.","El \xfanico error imperdonable en el que incurren todas las personas verdaderamente buenas y que nunca pueden evitar es conversar de forma sincera","I am sick to death of cleverness.\xa0 Everybody is clever nowadays.\xa0 You can\u2019t go anywhere without meeting clever people.\xa0 The thing has become an absolute public nuisance.","There is indeed a poetical attitude to be adopted towards all things, but all things are not fit subjects for poetry. Into the secure and sacred house of Beauty the true artist will admit nothing that is harsh or disturbing, nothing that gives pain, nothing that is debatable, nothing about which men argue. He can steep himself, if he wishes, in the discussion of all the social problems of his day, poor-laws and local taxation, free trade and bimetallic currency, and the like; but when he writes on these subjects it will be, as Milton nobly expressed it, with his left hand, in prose and not in verse, in a pamphlet and not in a lyric. This exquisite spirit of artistic choice was not in Byron: Wordsworth had it not. In the work of both these men there is much that we have to reject, much that does not give us that sense of calm and perfect repose which should be the effect of all fine, imaginative work. But in Keats it seemed to have been incarnate, and in his lovely ODE ON A GRECIAN URN it found its most secure and faultless expression; in the pageant of the EARTHLY PARADISE and the knights and ladies of Burne-Jones it is the one dominant note. It is to no avail that the Muse of Poetry be called, even by such a clarion note as Whitman\u2019s, to migrate from Greece and Ionia and to placard REMOVED and TO LET on the rocks of the snowy Parnassus. Calliope\u2019s call is not yet closed, nor are the epics of Asia ended; the Sphinx is not yet silent, nor the fountain of Castaly dry. For art is very life itself and knows nothing of death; she is absolute truth and takes no care of fact; she sees (as I remember Mr. Swinburne insisting on at dinner) that Achilles is even now more actual and real than Wellington, not merely more noble and interesting as a type and figure but more positive and real.","Cecily: - La explicaci\xf3n parece satisfactoria, \xbfno?Gwendolen: - S\xed, siempre que usted le crea.Cecily: - No le creo, pero eso no afecta la belleza de su respuesta","Who had a large wardrobe of Humour\'s cast-off clothes","The Book of Life begins with a man and a woman in a garden.

To stake all one\'s life on one throw--whether thestake be power or pleasure I care not--there is no weakness in that.There is a horrible, a terrible, courage.","The steam whistle will not affright him nor the flutes of Arcadia weary him: for him there is but one time, the artistic moment; but one law, the law of form; but one land, the land of Beauty - a land removed indeed from the real world and yet more sensuous because more enduring; calm, yet with that calm which dwells in the faces of the Greek statues, the calm which comes not from the rejection but from the absorption of passion, the calm which despair and sorrow cannot disturb but intensify only. And so it comes that he who seems to stand most remote from his age is he who mirrors it best, because he has stripped life of what is accidental and transitory, stripped it of that \u2018mist of familiarity which makes life obscure to us.","The people who love only once in their lives are really the shallow people. what they call thier loyalty, and thier fidelity, i call either the lethargy of custom or their lack of imagination. faithfulness is to the emotional life what consistency is to the life of the intellect- simply a confession of failure.","There Is Only One Thing In The World Worse Than Being Talked About, And That Is Not Being Talked About.\\" \u2013 Oscar Wilde","Lo \xfanico que realmente demuestra es que nuestro futuro ser\xe1 igual a nuestro pasado, y que el pecado que hemos cometido una vez, y con amargura, lo repetiremos muchas veces, y con alegr\xeda.","I never saw a man who looked With such a wistful eye Upon that little tent of blue Which prisoners call the sky,","I am sick to death of cleverness.

Where in the arts themselves are we to find that breadth of human sympathy which is the condition of all noble work; where in the arts are we to look for what Mazzini would call the social ideas as opposed to the merely personal ideas? By virtue of what claim do I demand for the artist the love and loyalty of the men and women of the world? I think I can answer that. Whatever spiritual message an artist brings to his aid is a matter for his own soul. He may bring judgment like Michael Angelo or peace like Angelico; he may come with mourning like the great Athenian or with mirth like the singer of Sicily; nor is it for us to do aught but accept his teaching, knowing that we cannot smite the bitter lips of Leopardi into laughter or burden with our discontent Goethe\u2019s serene calm. But for warrant of its truth such message must have the flame of eloquence in the lips that speak it, splendour and glory in the vision that is its witness, being justified by one thing only - the flawless beauty and perfect form of its expression: this indeed being the social idea, being the meaning of joy in art. Not laughter where none should laugh, nor the calling of peace where there is no peace; not in painting the subject ever, but the pictorial charm only, the wonder of its colour, the satisfying beauty of its design.","It is very vulgar to talk like a dentist when one isn\'t a dentist.

Well, I think that the first duty of an art critic is to hold his tongue at all times, and upon all subjects: C\'EST UN GRAND AVANTAGE DE N\'AVOIR RIEN FAIT, MAIS IL NE FAUT PAS EN ABUSER.It is only through the mystery of creation that one can gain any knowledge of the quality of created things. You have listened to PATIENCE for a hundred nights and you have heard me for one only. It will make, no doubt, that satire more piquant by knowing something about the subject of it, but you must not judge of aestheticism by the satire of Mr. Gilbert. As little should you judge of the strength and splendour of sun or sea by the dust that dances in the beam, or the bubble that breaks on the wave, as take your critic for any sane test of art. For the artists, like the Greek gods, are revealed only to one another, as Emerson says somewhere; their real value and place time only can show. In this respect also omnipotence is with the ages. The true critic addresses not the artist ever but the public only. His work lies with them. Art can never have any other claim but her own perfection: it is for the critic to create for art the social aim, too, by teaching the people the spirit in which they are to approach all artistic work, the love they are to give it, the lesson they are to draw from it.","My dear boy, the people who love only once in their lives are really the shallow people.

Some day, when you are old and wrinkled and ugly, when thought has seared your forehead with its lines, and passion branded your lips with its hideous fires, you will feel it, you will feel it terribly. Now, wherever you go, you charm the world. Will it always be so? ... You have a wonderfully beautiful face, Mr. Gray. Don\'t frown. You have. And beauty is a form of genius--is higher, indeed, than genius, as it needs no explanation. It is of the great facts of the world, like sunlight, or spring-time, or the reflection in dark waters of that silver shell we call the moon. It cannot be questioned. It has its divine right of sovereignty. It makes princes of those who have it. You smile? Ah! when you have lost it you won\'t smile.... People say sometimes that beauty is only superficial. That may be so, but at least it is not so superficial as thought is. To me, beauty is the wonder of wonders. It is only shallow people who do not judge by appearances. The true mystery of the world is the visible, not the invisible.... Yes, Mr. Gray, the gods have been good to you. But what the gods give they quickly take away. You have only a few years in which to live really, perfectly, and fully. When your youth goes, your beauty will go with it, and then you will suddenly discover that there are no triumphs left for you, or have to content yourself with those mean triumphs that the memory of your past will make more bitter than defeats. Every month as it wanes brings you nearer to something dreadful. Time is jealous of you, and wars against your lilies and your roses. You will become sallow, and hollow-cheeked, and dull-eyed. You will suffer horribly.... Ah! realize your youth while you have it. Don\'t squander the gold of your days, listening to the tedious, trying to improve the hopeless failure, or giving away your life to the ignorant, the common, and the vulgar. These are the sickly aims, the false ideals, of our age. Live! Live the wonderful life that is in you! Let nothing be lost upon you. Be always searching for new sensations. Be afraid of nothing.... A new Hedonism--that is what our century wants. You might be its visible symbol. With your personality there is nothing you could not do. The world belongs to you for a season.... The moment I met you I saw that you were quite unconscious of what you really are, of what you really might be. There was so much in you that charmed me that I felt I must tell you something about yourself. I thought how tragic it would be if you were wasted. For there is such a little time that your youth will last--such a little time. The common hill-flowers wither, but they blossom again. The laburnum will be as yellow next June as it is now. In a month there will be purple stars on the clematis, and year after year the green night of its leaves will hold its purple stars. But we never get back our youth. The pulse of joy that beats in us at twenty becomes sluggish. Our limbs fail, our senses rot. We degenerate into hideous puppets, haunted by the memory of the passions of which we were too much afraid, and the exquisite temptations that we had not the courage to yield to. Youth! Youth! There is absolutely nothing in the world but youth!","Enough is as bad as a meal.

Nay, it is rather the beholder who lends to the beautiful thing its myriad meanings, and makes it marvellous for us, and sets it in some new relation to the age, so that it becomes a vital portion of our lives and a symbol of what we pray for, or perhaps of what, having prayed for, we fear that we may receive.","Like all poetical natures he loved ignorant people.

In every relation of life with others one has to find some moyen de vivre. In your case, one had either to give up to you or to give you up. There was no alternative. Through deep if misplaced affection for you: through great pity for your defects of temper and temperament: through my own proverbial good-nature and Celtic laziness: through an artistic aversion to coarse scenes and ugly words: through that incapacity to bear resentment of any kind which at that time characterised me: through my dislike of seeing life made bitter and uncomely by what to me, with my eyes really fixed on other things, seemed to be mere trifles too petty for more than a moment\'s thought or interest \u2013 through these reasons, simple as they may sound, I gave up to you always. As a natural result, your claims, your efforts at domination, your exactions grew more and more unreasonable. Your meanest motive, your lowest appetite, your most common passion, became to you laws by which the lives of others were to be guided always, and to which, if necessary, they were to be without scruple sacrificed. Knowing that by making a scene you could always have your way, it was but natural that you should proceed, almost unconsciously I have no doubt, to every excess of vulgar violence. At the end you did not know to what goal you were hurrying, or with what aim in view. Having made your own of my genius, my will-power, and my fortune, you required, in the blindness of an inexhaustible greed, my entire existence. You took it.","Like two doomed ships that pass in storm We had crossed each other\'s way: But we made no sign, we said no word, We had no word to say; For we did not meet in the holy night, But in the shameful day.","No married man is ever attractive except to his wife.","Colonel.

Apollo had been victor. The lyre had vanquished the reed. But perhaps the Greeks were mistaken. I hear in much modern Art the cry of Marsyas. It is bitter in Baudelaire, sweet and plaintive in Lamartine, mystic in Verlaine. It is in the deferred resolutions of Chopin\'s music. It is in the discontent that haunts Burne- Jones\'s women. Even Matthew Arnold, whose song of Callicles tells of \'the triumph of the sweet persuasive lyre,\' and the \'famous final victory,\' in such a clear note of lyrical beauty, has not a little of it; in the troubled undertone of doubt and distress that haunts his verses, neither Goethe nor Wordsworth could help him, though he followed each in turn, and when he seeks to mourn for THYRSIS or to sing of the SCHOLAR GIPSY, it is the reed that he has to take for the rendering of his strain. But whether or not the Phrygian Faun was silent, I cannot be. Expression is as necessary to me as leaf and blossoms are to the black branches of the trees that show themselves above the prison walls and are so restless in the wind.

According to the great alchemist, Pierre de Boniface, the diamond rendered a man invisible, and the agate of India made him eloquent. The cornelian appeased anger, and the hyacinth provoked sleep, and the amethyst drove away the fumes of wine. The garnet cast out demons, and the hydropicus deprived the moon of her color. The selenite waxed and waned with the moon, and the meloceus, that discovers thieves, could be affected only by the blood of kids.

Certainly few people had ever interested him so much as Dorian Gray, and yet the lad\'s mad adoration of some one else caused him not the slightest pang of annoyance or jealousy. He was pleased by it. It made him a more interesting study. He had been always enthralled by the methods of natural science, but the ordinary subject-matter of that science had seemed to him trivial and of no import. And so he had begun by vivisecting himself, as he had ended by vivisecting others. Human life\u2014that appeared to him the one thing worth investigating. Compared to it there was nothing else of any value. It was true that as one watched life in its curious crucible of pain and pleasure, one could not wear over one\'s face a mask of glass, nor keep the sulphurous fumes from troubling the brain and making the imagination turbid with monstrous fancies and misshapen dreams. There were poisons so subtle that to know their properties one had to sicken of them. There were maladies so strange that one had to pass through them if one sought to understand their nature. And, yet, what a great reward one received! How wonderful the whole world became to one! To note the curious hard logic of passion, and the emotional coloured life of the intellect\u2014to observe where they met, and where they separated, at what point they were in unison, and at what point they were at discord\u2014there was a delight in that! What matter what the cost was? One could never pay too high a price for any sensation.","The very violence of a revolution may make the public grand and splendid for a moment. It was a fatal day when the public discovered that the pen is mightier than the paving-stone, and can be made as offensive as the brickbat.

But talk not of the soul, for to us it is nought, nor has it any value for our service.\' And the young Fisherman said to himself: \'How strange a thing this is! The Priest telleth me that the soul is worth all the gold in the world, and the merchants say that it is not worth a clipped piece of silver.\' And he passed out of the market-place, and went down to the shore of the sea, and began to ponder on what he should do.","Women treat us just as Humanity treats its gods. They worship us, and are always bothering us to do something for them\', answered Lord Henry, toying with some fruits. \'I should have said that whatever they ask for they had first given to us,\' murmured Dorian Gray, gravely. \'They create Love in our natures.

The great majority of people being fully aware of this, rank themselves naturally on the side of that splendid system that elevates them to the dignity of machines, and rage so wildly against the intrusion of the intellectual faculty into any question that concerns life, that one is tempted to define man as a rational animal who always loses his temper when he is called upon to act in accordance with the dictates of reason.","I am quite content with philosophic contemplation. But, as the nineteenth century has gone bankrupt through an over-expenditure of sympathy, I would suggest that we should appeal to science to put us straight.

Something seemed to tell me that I was on the verge of a terrible crisis in my life. I had a strange feeling that Fate had in store for me exquisite joys and exquisite sorrows. I grew afraid, and turned to quit the room. It was not conscience that made me do so: it was a sort of cowardice.

It was to have its service of the intellect, certainly,yet it was never to accept any theory or system that would involvethe sacrifice of any mode of passionate experience. Its aim,indeed, was to be experience itself, and not the fruits ofexperience, sweet or bitter as they might be. Of the asceticismthat deadens the senses, as of the vulgar profligacy that dullsthem, it was to know nothing. But it was to teach man toconcentrate himself upon the moments of a life that is itself but amoment.","When I was brought down from my prison to the Court of Bankruptcy, between two policemen,\u2014waited in the long dreary corridor that, before the whole crowd, whom an action so sweet and simple hushed into silence, he might gravely raise his hat to me, as, handcuffed and with bowed head, I passed him by.

It was in this spirit, and with this mode of love, that the saints knelt down to wash the feet of the poor, or stooped to kiss the leper on the cheek. I have never said one single word to him about what he did. I do not know to the present moment whether he is aware that I was even conscious of his action. It is not a thing for which one can render formal thanks in formal words. I store it in the treasure-house of my heart.

The basis of optimism is sheer terror. We think that we are generous because we credit our neighbour with the possession of those virtues that are likely to be a benefit to us. We praise the banker that we may overdraw our account, and find good qualities in the highwayman in the hope that he may spare our pockets. I mean everything that I have said.

And all men kill the thing they love, By all let this be heard, Some do it with a bitter look, Some with a flattering word, The coward does it with a kiss, The brave man with a sword!","The greatest events of life often leave one unmoved; they pass out of consciousness, and, when one thinks of them, become unreal. Even the scarlet flowers of passion seem to grow out in the same meadow as the poppies of oblivion. We reject the burden of their memory, and have anodynes against them. But the little things, the things of no moment, remain with us.","I He did not wear his scarlet coat, For blood and wine are red, And blood and wine were on his hands When they found him with the dead, The poor dead woman whom he loved, And murdered in her bed.

He winced at the memory of all that he had suffered, and for a moment the same curious feeling of loathing for Basil Hallward that had made him kill him as he sat in the chair came back to him, and he grew cold with passion. The dead man was still sitting there, too, and in the sunlight now. How horrible that was! Such hideous things were for the darkness, not for the day.","To have ruined one\'s self over poetry is an honour.","No sooner, in fact, had I sent it off than a curious reaction came over me. It seemed to me that I had given away my capacity for belief in the Willie Hughes theory of the Sonnets, that something had gone out of me, as it were, and that I was perfectly indifferent to the whole subject. What was it that had happened? It is difficult to say, perhaps, by finding perfect expression for a passion I had exhausted the passion itself. Emotional forces, like the forces of physical life, have their positive limitations. Perhaps the mere effort to convert any one to a theory involves some form of renunciation of the power of credence. Perhaps I was simply tired of the whole thing, and, my enthusiasm having burnt out, my reason was left to its own unimpassioned judgment. However it came about, and I cannot pretend to explain it, there was no doubt that Willie Hughes suddenly became to me a mere myth, an idle dream, the boyish fancy of a young man who, like most ardent spirits, was more anxious to convince others than to be himself convinced.","But then no artist expects grace from the vulgar mind, or style from the suburban intellect.

And these pre-Raphaelites, what were they? If you ask nine-tenths of the British public what is the meaning of the word aesthetics, they will tell you it is the French for affectation or the German for a dado; and if you inquire about the pre-Raphaelites you will hear something about an eccentric lot of young men to whom a sort of divine crookedness and holy awkwardness in drawing were the chief objects of art. To know nothing about their great men is one of the necessary elements of English education. As regards the pre-Raphaelites the story is simple enough. In the year 1847 a number of young men in London, poets and painters, passionate admirers of Keats all of them, formed the habit of meeting together for discussions on art, the result of such discussions being that the English Philistine public was roused suddenly from its ordinary apathy by hearing that there was in its midst a body of young men who had determined to revolutionise English painting and poetry. They called themselves the pre- Raphaelite Brotherhood. In England, then as now, it was enough for a man to try and produce any serious beautiful work to lose all his rights as a citizen; and besides this, the pre-Raphaelite Brotherhood - among whom the names of Dante Rossetti, Holman Hunt and Millais will be familiar to you - had on their side three things that the English public never forgives: youth, power and enthusiasm.","There are things that are right to say but that may be said at the wrong time and to the wrong people.

The discovery of marble quarries in the purple ravines of Pentelicus and on the little low-lying hills of the island of Paros gave to the Greeks the opportunity for that intensified vitality of action, that more sensuous and simple humanism, to which the Egyptian sculptor working laboriously in the hard porphyry and rose-coloured granite of the desert could not attain. The splendour of the Venetian school began with the introduction of the new oil medium for painting. The progress in modern music has been due to the invention of new instruments entirely, and in no way to an increased consciousness on the part of the musician of any wider social aim.","Los ingleses tienen 3 cosas de las que mostrarse orgullosos: El t\xe9, el whisky y un escritor como yo.Pero resulta que el t\xe9 es chino; el whisky, escoc\xe9s; y yo soy irland\xe9s.","Live the wonderful life that is in you!

We find it in the mysticism of Plato and in the rationalism of Aristotle. We find it later in the Italian Renaissance agitating the minds of such men as Leonardo da Vinci. Schiller tried to adjust the balance between form and feeling, and Goethe to estimate the position of self-consciousness in art. Wordsworth\u2019s definition of poetry as \u2018emotion remembered in tranquillity\u2019 may be taken as an analysis of one of the stages through which all imaginative work has to pass; and in Keats\u2019s longing to be \u2018able to compose without this fever\u2019 (I quote from one of his letters), his desire to substitute for poetic ardour \u2018a more thoughtful and quiet power,\u2019 we may discern the most important moment in the evolution of that artistic life. The question made an early and strange appearance in your literature too; and I need not remind you how deeply the young poets of the French romantic movement were excited and stirred by Edgar Allan Poe\u2019s analysis of the workings of his own imagination in the creating of that supreme imaginative work which we know by the name of THE RAVEN.","Une fatalit\xe9 s\'attache \xe0 toute sup\xe9riorit\xe9 de l\'esprit ou du corps, cette m\xeame fatalit\xe9 qu\'on voit, \xe0 travers l\'histoire, s\'\xe9lancer sur les pas mal assur\xe9s des rois.

Upon my word, Basil, I didn\'t know you were so vain; and I really can\'t see any resemblance between you, with your rugged strong face and your coal-black hair, and this young Adonis, who looks as if he was made out of ivory and rose-leaves. Why, my dear Basil, he is a Narcissus, and you--well, of course you have an intellectual expression and all that. But beauty, real beauty, ends where an intellectual expression begins. Intellect is in itself a mode of exaggeration, and destroys the harmony of any face. The moment one sits down to think, one becomes all nose, or all forehead, or something horrid. Look at the successful men in any of the learned professions. How perfectly hideous they are! Except, of course, in the Church. But then in the Church they don\'t think. A bishop keeps on saying at the age of eighty what he was told to say when he was a boy of eighteen, and as a natural consequence he always looks absolutely delightful. Your mysterious young friend, whose name you have never told me, but whose picture really fascinates me, never thinks. I feel quite sure of that. He is some brainless beautiful creature who should be always here in winter when we have no flowers to look at, and always here in summer when we want something to chill our intelligence.

It is like a bric-a-brac shop, all monsters and dust, with everything priced above its proper value.","It is said that all martyrdoms seemed mean to the looker-on.","Un homme peut \xeatre heureux avec n\'importe quelle femme, \xe0 condition de ne pas l\'aimer.","All these appeals to art to set herself more in harmony with modern progress and civilisation, and to make herself the mouthpiece for the voice of humanity, these appeals to art \'to have a mission,\' are appeals which should be made to the public. The art which has fulfilled the conditions of beauty has fulfilled all conditions: it is for the critic to teach the people how to find in the calm of such art the highest expression of their own most stormy passions. \'I have no reverence,\' said Keats, \'for the public, nor for anything in existence but the Eternal Being, the memory of great men and the principle of Beauty.\'Such then is the principle which I believe to be guiding and underlying our English Renaissance, a Renaissance many-sided and wonderful, productive of strong ambitions and lofty personalities, yet for all its splendid achievements in poetry and in the decorative arts and in painting, for all the increased comeliness and grace of dress, and the furniture of houses and the like, not complete. For there can be no great sculpture without a beautiful national life, and the commercial spirit of England has killed that; no great drama without a noble national life, and the commercial spirit of England has killed that too.It is not that the flawless serenity of marble cannot bear the burden of the modern intellectual spirit, or become instinct with the fire of romantic passion - the tomb of Duke Lorenzo and the chapel of the Medici show us that - but it is that, as Theophile Gautier used to say, the visible world is dead, LE MONDE VISIBLE A DISPARU.","we live in an age when unnecessary things are our only necessities;","The very essence of romance is uncertainty.

The work of Balzac and of Hugo grew up side by side together; nay, more, were complementary to each other, though neither of them saw it. While all other forms of poetry may flourish in an ignoble age, the splendid individualism of the lyrist, fed by its own passion, and lit by its own power, may pass as a pillar of fire as well across the desert as across places that are pleasant. It is none the less glorious though no man follow it - nay, by the greater sublimity of its loneliness it may be quickened into loftier utterance and intensified into clearer song.","To get back my youth I would do anything in the world, except take exercise, get up early, or be respectable. Youth! There is nothing like it.","Todo o retrato que \xe9 pintado com sentimento \xe9 um retrato do artista e n\xe3o do modelo. O modelo \xe9 apenas o acidente, o pretexto.

But the drama is the meeting-place of art and life; it deals, as Mazzini said, not merely with man, but with social man, with man in his relation to God and to Humanity. It is the product of a period of great national united energy; it is impossible without a noble public, and belongs to such ages as the age of Elizabeth in London and of Pericles at Athens; it is part of such lofty moral and spiritual ardour as came to Greek after the defeat of the Persian fleet, and to Englishman after the wreck of the Armada of Spain.","Der Tr\xe4umer braucht nur den Mond, um sich zurechtzufinden, und zur Strafe sieht er den Morgen schon vor dem Rest der Welt.","For you, at least, are young; \u2018no hungry generations tread you down,\u2019 and the past does not weary you with the intolerable burden of its memories nor mock you with the ruins of a beauty, the secret of whose creation you have lost. That very absence of tradition, which Mr. Ruskin thought would rob your rivers of their laughter and your flowers of their light, may be rather the source of your freedom and your strength.","A we wszystkich romansach najgorsze jest to, \u017ce cz\u0142owiek wychodzi z nich pozbawiony wszelkiego romantyzmu.","I foresee,\u2019 said Goethe, \u2018the dawn of a new literature which all people may claim as their own, for all have contributed to its foundation.\u2019 If, then, this is so, and if the materials for a civilisation as great as that of Europe lie all around you, what profit, you will ask me, will all this study of our poets and painters be to you? I might answer that the intellect can be engaged without direct didactic object on an artistic and historical problem; that the demand of the intellect is merely to feel itself alive; that nothing which has ever interested men or women can cease to be a fit subject for culture."]')}}]);
