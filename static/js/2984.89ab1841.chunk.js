They move the rubbisharound, but the solid mountain of true naturestays where it\'s always been.There\'s nothing nowexcept the divine qualities.Come through the opening into me.Your impudence was better than any reverence,because in this moment I am you and you are me.I give you this opened heart as God gives gifts:the poison of your spit has becomethe honey of friendship.","I wonderfrom these thousand of \\"me\'s\\",which one am I?Listen to my cry, do not drown my voiceI am completely filled with the thought of you.Don\'t lay broken glass on my pathI will crush it into dust.I am nothing, just a mirror in the palm of your hand,reflecting your kindness, your sadness, your anger.If you were a blade of grass or a tiny flowerI will pitch my tent in your shadow.Only your presence revives my withered heart.You are the candle that lights the whole worldand I am an empty vessel for your light.

We are lutes, no more, no less. If the soundbox is stuffed full of anything, no music. If the brain and belly are burning clean with fasting, every moment a new song comes out of the fire. The fog clears, and new energy makes you run up the steps in front of you. Be emptier and cry like reed instruments cry. Emptier, write secrets with the reed pen. When you\'re full of food and drink, Satan sits where your spirit should, an ugly metal statue in place of the Kaaba. When you fast, good habits gather like friends who want to help. Fasting is Solomon\'s ring. Don\'t give it to some illusion and lose your power, but even if you have, if you\'ve lost all will and control, they come back when you fast, like soldiers appearing out of the ground, pennants flying above them. A table descends to your tents, Jesus\' table. Expect to see it, when you fast, this table spread with other food, better than the broth of cabbages.","Wherever you stand, be the Soul of that place.\\"  -Rumi","Don\u2019t sit and wait.

Thou art in thy senses, but Majnun is beside himself. In love to be wide awake is treason. The more a man is awake, the more he sleeps (to love); His (critical) wakefulness is worse than slumbering. Our wakefulness fetters our spirits, Then our souls are a prey to divers whims, Thoughts of loss and gain and fears of misery.

Only a sleeper considers it real. Then death comes like dawn, and you wake up laughing at what you thought was your grief. But there\u2019s a difference with this dream. Everything cruel and unconscious done in the illusion of the present world, all that does not fade away at the death-waking. It stays, and it must be interpreted. All the mean laughing, all the quick, sexual wanting, those torn coats of Joseph, they change into powerful wolves that you must face.

Those who say, instead, \\"I am a servant of God\\" believe that two exist, themselves and God. But those who say, \\"I am God\\" have become nothing and have cast themselves to the winds. They say, \\"I am God\\" meaning, \\"I am not, God is all. There is no existence but God. I have lost all separation. I am nothing.\\" In this the humility is greater.This is what ordinary people don\u2019t understand. When they render service in honor of God\u2019s glory, their servanthood is still present. Even though it is for the sake of God, they still see themselves and their own actions as well as God\u2014they are not drowned in the water.

They roll head over heels,  rushing toward the Beautiful One  like a torrent of water  In truth, everyone is a shadow of the Beloved \u2013 Our seeking is His seeking,  Our words are His words.  At times we flow toward the Beloved  like a dancing stream.  At times we are still water  held in His pitcher.  At times we boil in a pot  turning to vapor \u2013 that is the job of the Beloved.  He breathes into my ear  until my soul  takes on His fragrance.  He is the soul of my soul \u2013 How can I escape?  But why would any soul in this world  want to escape from the Beloved?  He will melt your pride  making you thin as a strand of hair,  Yet do not trade, even for both worlds,  One strand of His hair.  We search for Him here and there  while looking right at Him.  Sitting by His side we ask,  \\"O Beloved, where is the Beloved?\\"  Enough with such questions! \u2013 Let silence take you to the core of life.

Someone asks, \\"Don\'t you worryabout God\'s wrath when you spank a child?\\" \\"I\'m not spanking my child, but the demonin him.\\" When a mother screams, \\"Get out of here!\\" she means the mean part of the child.Don\'t run from those who scold, and don\'t turn away from cleansing conflict, or you willremain weak.

It can happen any moment. It takes thirty-five hundred yearsto get to Saturn, but Saturnine qualities are constantly here making us solemn and serious.Influence goes the other way too. An enlightened master, which is to say the innernature of each of us, is continually affecting the universe. Philosophers say a human being isthe universe in samll, but it is more true that the essence of a human is the whole from which the cosmos grew.

The true watchers and seekers are those whoremember, who return in sleep like elephants to Hindustan.","There is a way of loving not attached to what is loved.Observe how water is with the ground,always moving toward the ocean,though the ground tries to hold water\u2019s footand not let it go.","The animal soul, the intelligent soul, and two kinds of knowingThere\'s a part of us that\'s like an itch. Call itthe animal soul, a foolishness that, when we\'re in it, makes hundreds of others around usitchy. And there is an intelligent soul with another desire, more like sweet basil or the feelof a breeze. Listen and be thankful even for scolding that comes from the intelligent soul.It flows out close to where you flowed out. But that itchiness wants to put foodin our mouths that will make us sick, feverish with the aftertaste of kissing a donkey\'s rump. It\'s like blackening your robe against a kettle without being anywherenear a table of companionship. The truth of being human is an empty table made ofsoul intelligence. Gradually reduce what you give your animal soul, the breadthat after all overflows from sunlight. The animal soul itself spilled out and sproutedfrom the other. Taste more often what nourishes your clear light, and you\'ll have less usefor the smoky oven. You\'ll bury that baking equipment in the ground! There are two kindsof knowing: one acquired, as a child in school memorizes facts and concepts from booksand from what the teacher says, collecting information from the traditional sciences as well asthe new sciences. With such intelligence you rise in the world. You get rankedahead or behind others with regard to your competence in retaining information. YOustroll with this intelligence in and out of fields of knowledge, getting always moremarks on your tablets. There is another kind of tablet, one already completed inside you.A spring overflowing its springbox. A freshness in the center of your chest. Thisintelligence does not turn yellow or stagnate. It\'s fluid, and it doesn\'t move from outsideto inside through the conduits of plumbing-learning. This second knowing is a fountainheadfrom within you moving out. Drink from there!","If there were no grace and no kindness,conversation would be useless, and nothing we do would matter. Listento the new stories that begin every day. If light were not beginningagain in the east, I would not now wake and walk out inside this dawn.","Muhammad once was talking to a crowdof chieftains, princes with great influence,when a poor blind man interrupted him.Muhammad frowned and said to the man,\\"Let me attend to these visitors.This is a rare chance,whereas you are already my friend.We\'ll have ample time.\\"Then somebody nearby said, \\"That blind manmay be worth a hundred kings. Remember the proverb, Human beings are mines.\\"World-power means nothing. Only the unsayable, jeweled inner life matters.Muhammad replied, \\"Do not think that I\'m concerned with being acknowledged by these authorities.If a beetle moves toward rosewater, it provesthat the solution is diluted. Beetleslove dung, not rose essence.If a coin is eager to be testedby the touchstone, that coinitself may be a touchstone.A thief loves the night.I am day.

Move outside the tangle of fear-thinking. Live in silence. Flow down and down in always widening rings of being.","Drink all your passion, and be a disgrace. Close both eyes to see with the other eye.","To dance is not to jump to your feet and rise painlessly in the air like dust. To rise above both worlds is to dance in the blood of your pain and give up your life.","AFTER BEING IN LOVE, THE NEXT RESPONSIBILITYTurn me like a waterwheel turning a millstone. Plenty of water, a Living River. Keep me in one place and scatter the love. Leaf-moves in wind, straw drawn toward amber, all parts of the world are in love, but they do not tell their secrets. Cows grazing on a sacramental table, ants whispering in Solomon\'s ear. Mountains mumbling an echo. Sky, calm. If the sun were not in love, he would have no brightness, the side of the hill no grass on it. The ocean would come to rest somewhere.Be a lover as they are, that you come to know you Beloved. Be faithful that you may know Faith. The other parts of the universe did not accept the next responsibility of love as you can.

The body is like a cloak and my heart in it like a mystic, The world is like a monastery and He is my Guide.

There is a world outside Islam and Disbelief, We are enamoured of the atmosphere therein. The mystic lays down his head when he reaches there. There is neither Islam nor Disbelief in this place.

Someone who thinks there\'s no meaning or purposefeels drawn to images of futility. Each moves to be with its own. The ox does not turntoward a lion. Wolves have no interest in Joseph, unless to devour him. But if a wolfis cured of wolfishness, it will sleep close by Joseph, like a dog in the presence ofmeditators.

The arrow of his glance needs not a bow that I should beguile the shaft of his gaze with a bow. He is not prisoner of the world, fettered to this world of earth, that I should beguile him with gold of the  kingdom of the world. He is an angel, though in form he is a man; he is not lustful that I should beguile him with women. Angels start away from the house wherein this form is, so how should I beguile him with such a form and likeness? He does not take a flock of horses, since he flies on wings; his food is light, so how should I beguile him with bread? He is not a merchant and trafficker in the market of the world that I should beguile him with enchantment of gain and loss. He is not veiled that I should make myself out sick and utter sighs, to beguile him with lamentation. I will bind my head and bow my head, for I have got out of hand; I will not beguile his compassion with sickness or fluttering. Hair by hair he sees my crookedness and feigning; what\u2019s hidden from him that I should beguile him with anything hidden. He is not a seeker of fame, a prince addicted to poets, that I should beguile him with verses and lyrics and flowing poetry.

No matter whether love is of this world or of the next, it steals us to that world. Whatever words I say to explain this love, when I arrive at love, I am ashamed.

We may reprimand our friends, but wenever reprimand a stranger.Now there are levels of reprimand. When aperson is stung by it and sees the truth in it, thatis a sign that God loves them and cares for them.But if the reprimand flies by that person withoutcausing any pain at all, then this is no sign of love.When a carpet is beaten to get rid of the dust,intelligent people do not call that a reprimand.But if a woman beats her own darling child, thenthat is called a reprimand and is a proof of herlove. Therefore, as long as you find pain andregret within yourself, that is a proof of God\u2019slove and guidance.If you find fault in your brother or sister, thefault you see in them is within yourself.

All evil qualities\u2014oppression, hatred, envy, greed, mercilessness, pride\u2014when they are within yourself, they bring no pain. When you see them in another, then you shy away and feel the pain. We feel no disgust at our own scab and abscess. We will dip our infected hand into our food and lick our fingers without turning in the least bit squeamish. But if we see a tiny abscess or half a scratch on another\u2019s hand, we shy away from that person\u2019s food and have no stomach for it whatsoever. Evil qualities are just like scabs and abscesses; when they are within us they cause no pain, but when we see them even to a small degree in another, then we feel pain and disgust. Just as you shy away from your brother or sister, so you should excuse them for shying away from you. The pain you feel comes from those faults, and they see the same faults. The seeker of truth is a mirror for their neighbors. But those who cannot feel the sting of truth are not mirrors to anyone but themselves.\u201d","INWARD OCCUPATION When Satan sees, to the left or right, anyone who is perfect, he becomes ill with envy, for every wretch whose stack has been burnt is unwilling that anyone else\u2019s candle should be lighted.

The former have ulterior motives.They want the midwife near, because she gives them milk.The others love the beauty of the nurse. The former memorize the prooftexts of conformity,and repeat them.

The sun became dispersed through the windows; the windows became shut, and the numbers departed. Those numbers which existed in the grapes are naughted in the juice which flows from the grapes. Whosoever is living by the light of God, the death of this spirit is replenishment to him. Speak not evil, speak not good regarding those who have passed away from good and evil. Fix your eye on God, and speak not of what you have not seen, that He may implant another eye in your eye. That eye is the eye of the eye, nothing unseen or secret escapes from it. When its gaze is by the Light of God, to such a light what can be hidden? Though all lights are the Light of God, call not all of those the eternal Light. Eternal light is that which is the Light of God, transient light is the attribute of flesh and body. The light in this mortal eye is a fire, save for that eye which God anoints with surmeh {collyrium}. His fire became light for the sake of Abraham; the eye of reason became in quality like the eye of an ass. O God, the bird of the eye which has seen Your bounty flies in Your air. The Pole, he who is the sky of the skies, is on the lookout in search of You; Either grant him vision to see You, or do not dismiss him on account of this fault. Make tearful the eye of your soul every moment, guard it against the snare of human stature and cheek. Eye asleep and yourself wakeful\u2014such a sleep is perfection and rectitude; But the eye asleep that finds no interpretation (of dreams)\u2014expel it from sleep, despite envy. Else it will labour and be boiling in the fire of love of the One, even to the grave.","Somewhere out beyond rightness and wrongness, there is a field...I\'ll meet you there.","Out beyond ideas of wrong doing & right doing there is a field.

Don\'t stroll idly through the bazaar of the perfume-markers: Stay in the shop of the sugar-seller. If you don\'t find true balance, anyone can deceive you; Anyone can trick out of a thing of straw, And make you take it for gold Don\'t squat with a bowl before every boiling pot; In each pot on the fire you find very different things. Not all sugarcanes have sugar, not all abysses a peak; Not all eyes possess vision, not every sea is full of pearls. O nightingale, with your voice of dark honey! Go on lamenting! Only your drunken ecstasy can pierce the rock\'s hard heart! Surrender yourself, and if you cannot be welcomes by the Friend, Know that you are rebelling inwardly like a thread That doesn\'t want to go through the needle\'s eye! The awakened heart is a lamp; protect it by the him of your robe! Hurry and get out of this wind, for the weather is bad. And when you\'ve left this storm, you will come to a fountain; You\'ll find a Friend there who will always nourish your soul. And with your soul always green, you\'ll grow into a tall tree Flowering always with sweet light-fruit, whose growth is interior.","When the Queen of Sheba thought to honor Solomon, she loaded forty mules with gold bricks, butwhen her caravan reached the wide plain leading to Solomon\'s palace, they noticed thatthe top layer of the plateau was pure gold!
