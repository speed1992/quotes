One is to believe what isn\'t true; the other is to refuse to believe what is true.","Life can only be understood backwards; but it must be lived forwards.","The most common form of despair is not being who you are.","I found I had less and less to say, until finally, I became silent, and began to listen. I discovered in the silence, the voice of God","Life is not a problem to be solved, but a reality to be experienced.","People demand freedom of speech as a compensation for the freedom of thought which they seldom use.","It is better to try something and fail than to try nothing and succeed. The result may be the same, but you won\'t be. We always grow more through defeats than victories.","Christ was crucified because he would have nothing to do with the crowd (even though he addressed himself to all). He did not want to form a party, an interest group, a mass movement, but wanted to be what he was, the truth, which is related to the single individual. Therefore everyone who will genuinely serve the truth is by that very fact a martyr. To win a crowd is no art; for that only untruth is needed, nonsense, and a little knowledge of human passions. But no witness to the truth dares to get involved with the crowd.","Above all, do not lose your desire to walk. Everyday, I walk myself into a state of well-being & walk away from every illness. I have walked myself into my best thoughts, and I know of no thought so burdensome that one cannot walk away from it. But by sitting still, & the more one sits still, the closer one comes to feeling ill. Thus if one just keeps on walking, everything will be all right.","Take a chance and you may lose. Take not a chance and you have lost already.","The Bible is very easy to understand. But we Christians are a bunch of scheming swindlers. We pretend to be unable to understand it because we know very well that the minute we understand, we are obliged to act accordingly.","People settle for a level of despair they can tolerate and call it happiness.","A fire broke out backstage in a theatre. The clown came out to warn the public; they thought it was a joke and applauded. He repeated it; the acclaim was even greater. I think that\'s just how the world will come to an end: to the general applause of wits who believe it\'s a joke.","The function of prayer is not to influence God, but rather to change the nature of the one who prays.","The unhappy person is never present to themself because they always live in the past or the future.","God creates everything out of nothing. And everything which God is to use, he first reduces to nothing","Once you label me you negate me.","The highest and most beautiful things in life are not to be heard about, nor read about, nor seen but, if one will, are to be lived.","In order to help another effectively, I must understand what he understands. If I do not know that, my greater understanding will be of no help to him... instruction begins when you put yourself in his place so that you may understand what he understands and in the way he understands it.","To love another person is to help them love God.","Truth always rests with the minority, and the minority is always stronger than the majority, because the minority is generally formed by those who really have an opinion, while the strength of a majority is illusory, formed by the gangs who have no opinion - and who, therefore, in the next instant (when it is evident that the minority is the stronger) assume its opinion ... while Truth again reverts to a new minority.","Do it or don\'t do it - you will regret both.","The greatest danger to Christianity is, I contend, not heresies, not heterodoxies, not atheists, not profane secularism - no, but the kind of orthodoxy which is cordial drivel, mediocrity served up sweet. There is nothing that so insidiously displaces the majestic as cordiality.","Our life always expresses the result of our dominant thoughts.","A man prayed, and at first he thought that prayer was talking. But he became more and more quiet until in the end he realized prayer is listening.","The most painful state of being is remembering the future, particularly the one you\'ll never have.","Face the facts of being what you are, for that is what changes what you are.","The more people who believe something, the more apt it is to be wrong. The person who\'s right often has to stand alone.","It is the duty of the human understanding to understand that there are things which it cannot understand.","And this is the simple truth - that to live is to feel oneself lost. He who accepts it has already begun to find himself, to be on firm ground. Instinctively, as do the shipwrecked, he will look around for something to which to cling, and that tragic, ruthless glance, absolutely sincere, because it is a question of his salvation, will cause him to bring order into the chaos of his life. These are the only genuine ideas; the ideas of the shipwrecked. All the rest is rhetoric, posturing, farce.","Confidence is the present tense of hope.","It is not where we breathe, but where we Love, that we live.","It is not the path which is the difficulty; rather, it is the difficulty which is the path.","The daily press is the evil principle of the modern world, and time will only serve to disclose this fact with greater and greater clearness. The capacity of the newspaper for degeneration is sophistically without limit, since it can always sink lower and lower in its choice of readers. At last it will stir up all those dregs of humanity which no state or government can control.","For without risk there is no faith, and the greater the risk, the greater the faith.","How did I get into the world? Why was I not asked about it and why was I not informed of the rules and regulations but just thrust into the ranks as if I had been bought by a peddling shanghaier of human beings? How did I get involved in this big enterprise called actuality? Why should I be involved? Isn\'t it a matter of choice? And if I am compelled to be involved, where is the manager\u2014I have something to say about this. Is there no manager? To whom shall I make my complaint?","The question is not \\"To be or not to be,\\" it is what we should be until we are not.","The door to happiness opens outward.","The thing that cowardice fears most is decision","If you think you understand, it isn\'t God.","Future is everything that past has forgotten.","And this is one of the most crucial definitions for the whole of Christianity; that the opposite of sin is not virtue but faith.","In a theatre it happened that a fire started off stage. The clown came out to tell the audience. They thought it was a joke and applauded. He told them again, and they became still more hilarious. This is the way, I suppose, that the world will be destroyed-amid the universal hilarity of wits and wags who think it is all a joke.","Who am I? How did I come into the world? Why was I not consulted?","Hope is passion for what is possible.","Wherever there is a crowd there is untruth.","Are you not aware that there comes a midnight hour when everyone must unmask...","To be a woman is something so strange, so confusing and so complicated that only a woman could put up with it.","Love is the expression of the one who loves, not of the one who is loved. Those who think they can love only the people they prefer do not love at all. Love discovers truths about individuals that others cannot see","Do not interrupt the flight of your soul; do not distress what is best in you; do not enfeeble your spirit with half wishes and half thoughts. Ask yourself and keep on asking until you find the answer, for one may have known something many times, acknowledged it; one may have willed something many times, attempted it - and yet, only the deep inner motion, only the heart\'s indescribable emotion, only that will convince you that what you have acknowledged belongs to you, that no power can take it from you - for only the truth that builds up is truth for you.","To dare is to lose one\'s footing momentarily. Not to dare is to lose oneself.","Life is lived forwards, but understood backwards.","If I were a physician, and if I were allowed to prescribe just one remedy for all the ills of the modern world, I would prescribe silence. For even if the Word of God were proclaimed in the modern world, how could one hear it with so much noise? Therefore, create silence.","I\'m so misunderstood that people misunderstand me even when I tell them I\'m misunderstood.","The spiritual differs from the religious in being able to endure isolation. The rank of a spiritual person is proportionate to his strength for enduring isolation, whereas we religious people are constantly in need of \'the others,\' the herd. We religious folks die, or despair, if we are not reassured by being in the assembly, of the same opinion as the congregation, and so on. But the Christianity of the New Testament is precisely related to the isolation of the spiritual man.","The difference between an admirer and a follower still remains, no matter where you are. The admirer never makes any true sacrifices. He always plays it safe. Though in words, phrases, songs, he is inexhaustible about how highly he prizes Christ, he renounces nothing, gives up nothing, will not reconstruct his life, will not be what he admires, and will not let his life express what it is he supposedly admires.","The self-assured believer is a greater sinner in the eyes of God than the troubled disbeliever.","The tyrant dies and his rule is over, the martyr dies and his rule begins.","Once you are born in this world you\u2019re old enough to die.","The best news the World has ever heard came from a graveyard - Christ is risen!","Most people are subjective toward themselves and objective toward all others, frightfully objective sometimes--but the task is precisely to be objective toward oneself and subjective toward all others.","Which is more difficult, to awaken one who sleeps or to awaken one who, awake, dreams that he is awake?","Where am I? Who am I? How did I come to be here? What is this thing called the world? How did I come into the world? Why was I not consulted? And If I am compelled to take part in it, where is the director? I want to see him.","A man may perform astonishing feats and comprehend a vast amount of knowledge, and yet have no understanding of himself. But suffering directs a man to look within. If it succeeds, then there, within him, is the beginning of his learning.","The deepest form of despair is to choose to be another than himself.","If a man cannot forget, he will never amount to much.","There is nothing with which every man is so afraid as getting to know how enormously much he is capable of doing and becoming.","Above all, do not lose your desire to walk.","The object of (Christian) faith is not the teaching but the Teacher.","If I could prescribe only one remedy for all the ills of the modern world, I would prescribe silence.","Only the noble of heart are called to difficulty.","What is a poet? An unhappy person who conceals profound anguish in his heart but whose lips are so formed that as sighs and cries pass over them they sound like beautiful music.","Patience is necessary, and one cannot reap immediately where one has sown.","Truth is not something you can appropriate easily and quickly. You certainly cannot sleep or dream yourself to the truth. No, you must be tried, do battle, and suffer if you are to acquire the truth for yourself. It is a sheer illusion to think that in relation to the truth there is an abridgement, a short cut that dispenses with the necessity for struggling for it.","Don\'t forget to love yourself.","...Christ did not appoint professors, but followers. If Christianity ... is not reduplicated in the life of the person expounding it, then he does not expound Christianity, for Christianity is a message about living and can only be expounded by being realized in men\'s lives.","The truth is a trap: you cannot get it without it getting you; you cannot get the truth by capturing it, only by its capturing you.","The minority is always stronger than the majority, because the minority is generally formed by those who really have an opinion.","Comparison is the most dangerous acquaintance love can make.","Prayer is a silent surrendering of everything to God.","I must find a truth that is true for me.",". . .the larger the crowd, the more probable that that which it praises is folly, and the more improbable that it is truth; and the most improbable of all that it is any eternal truth.","The commandment is that you shall love, but when you understand life and yourself, then it is as if you should not need to be commanded, because to love human beings is still the only thing worth living for; without this life you really do not live.","Anxiety is the dizziness of freedom.","Listen to the cry of a woman in labor at the hour of giving birth - look at the dying man\'s struggle at his last extremity, and then tell me whether something that begins and ends thus could be intended for enjoyment.","Most men pursue pleasure with such breathless haste that they hurry past it.","All the shrewdness of \'man\' seeks one thing: to be able to live without responsibility.","Teach me, 0 God, not to torture myself, not to make a martyr out of myself through stifling reflection, but rather teach me to breathe deeply in faith.","God does not think; he creates. He does not exist; he is eternal.","A road well begun is the battle half won. The important thing is to make a beginning and \\n get under way.","We live as if we were unaware of our impending destruction","For love is exultant when it unites equals, but it is triumphant when it makes that which was unequal equal in love.","God creates out of nothing. Wonderful you say. Yes, to be sure, but he does what is still more wonderful: he makes saints out of sinners.","If you want to be loathsome to God, just run with the herd.","Happiness is the greatest hiding place for despair.","The more a person limits himself, the more resourceful he becomes.","Love is all, it gives all, and it takes all.","During the first period of a man\'s life the greatest danger is not to take the risk.","The truth must essentially be regarded as in conflict with this world; the world has never been so good, and will never become so good that the majority will desire the truth.","Life has its own hidden forces which you can only discover by living.","This is what is sad when one contemplates human life, that so many live out their lives in quiet lostness...they live, as it were, away from themselves and vanish like shadows. Their immortal souls are blown away, and they are not disquieted by the question of its immortality, because they are already disintegrated before they die.","It\'s better to get lost in the passion than to lose the passion","This is all that I\'ve known for certain, that God is love. Even if I have been mistaken on this or that point: God is nevertheless love.","As my prayer became more attentive and inward, I had less and less to say. I finally became completely silent... This is how it is. To pray does not mean to listen to oneself speaking. Prayer involves becoming silent, and being silent, and waiting until God is heard.","The Bible is God\'s love letter to us","Christ has not only spoken to us by his life but has also spoken for us by his death.","Love believes all things  and yet is never deceived.","The most terrible fight is not when there is one opinion against another, the most terrible is when two men say the same thing -- and fight about the interpretation, and this interpretation involves a difference of quality.","To cheat oneself out of love is the most terrible deception; it is an eternal loss for which there is no reparation, either in time or in eternity.","People have an idea that the preacher is an actor on a stage and they are the critics, blaming or praising him. What they don\'t know is that they are the actors on the stage; he (the preacher) is merely the prompter standing in the wings, reminding them of their lost lines.","You live life looking forward, you understand life looking backward.","It is more blessed to give than to receive, but then it is also more blessed to be able to do without than to have to have.","...the person who surrenders absolutely to God, with no reservations, is absolutely safe. From this safe hiding-place he can see the devil , but the devil cannot see him.","Geniuses are like thunderstorms: they go against the wind, terrify people, clear the air.","To Dare is to risk losing your foothold for a moment, Not to Dare is to risk losing yourself.","If anyone on the verge of action should judge himself according to the outcome, he would never begin.","A possibility is a hint from God. One must follow it.","Be that self which one truly is.","Idleness, we are accustomed to say, is the root of all evil. To prevent this evil, work is recommended.... Idleness as such is by no means a root of evil; on the contrary, it is truly a divine life, if one is not bored.","The truth is lived before it is understood. It must be fought for, tested, and appropriated. Truth is the way... Anyone will easily understand it if he just gives himself to it.","People understand me so poorly that they don\'t even understand my complaint about them not understanding me.","What labels me, negates me.","People commonly travel the world over to see rivers and mountains, new stars, garish birds, freak fish, grotesque breeds of human; they fall into an animal stupor that gapes at existence and they think they have seen something.","to have faith is precisely to lose one\'s mind so as to win God.","Truth has always had many loud proclaimers, but the question is whether a person will in the deepest sense acknowledge the truth, allow it to permeate his whole being, accept all its consequences, and not have an emergency hiding place for himself and a Judas kiss for the consequence.","A man who as a physical being is always turned toward the outside, thinking that his happiness lies outside him, finally turns inward and discovers that the source is within him.","It is very important in life to know when your cue comes.","Everyone looks the same to me in a photograph: stupid.","Every day I walk myself into a state of well-being and walk away from every illness; I have walked myself into my best thoughts.","Since my earliest childhood a barb of sorrow has lodged in my heart. As long as it stays I am ironic - if it is pulled out I shall die.","The truly simple way of presenting Christianity is to do it.","...the greatest thing each person can do is to give himself to God utterly and unconditionally - weaknesses, fears, and all. For God loves obedience more than good intentions or second-best offerings, which are all too often made under the guise of weakness.","How could it occur to anyone to demonstrate that God exists unless one has already allowed Himself to ignore Him? A king\'s existence is demonstrated by way of subjection and submissiveness. Do you want to try and demonstrate that the king exists? Will you do so by offering a string of proofs, a series of arguments? No. If you are serious, you will demonstrate the king\'s existence by your submission, by the way you live. And so it is with demonstrating God\'s existence. It is accomplished not by proofs but by worship. Any other way is but a thinker\'s pious bungling.","Hope is a passion for the possible.","The human race in the course of time has taken the liberty of softening and softening Christianity until at last we have contrived to make it exactly the opposite of what it is in the New Testament.","Most people rush after pleasure so fast that they rush right past it.","On the whole, the longing for solitude is a sign that there still is spirit in a person and is a measure of what spirit there is.","On the secretly blushing cheek is reflected the glow of the heart","Adversity not only draws people together, but brings forth that beautiful inward friendship.","Take away paradox from the thinker and you have a professor.","The melancholy have the best sense of the comic, the opulent often the best sense of the rustic, the dissolute often the best sense of the moral, and the doubter often the best sense of the religious.","I see it all perfectly; there are two possible situations - one can either do this or that. My honest opinion and my friendly advice is this: do it or do not do it - you will regret both.","Freedom\'s possibility is not the ability to choose the good or the evil. The possibility is to be able.","Prayer does not change God, but it changes him who prays.","When you read God\'s Word, you must constantly be saying to yourself, \\"It is talking to me, and about me\\".","The wisdom of the years is confusing. Only the wisdom of eternity is edifying.","There is peace and rest and comfort in sorrow","Men think that it is impossible for a human being to love his enemies, for enemies are hardly able to endure the sight of one another. Well, then, shut your eyes--and your enemy looks just like your neighbor.","Never cease loving a person, and never give up hope for him, for even the prodigal son who had fallen most low, could still be saved; the bitterest enemy and also he who was your friend could again be your friend; love that has grown cold can kindle.","The God that can be named is not God.","There is nothing everyone is so afraid of as being told how vastly much he is capable of. You are capable of - do you want to know? - you are capable of living in poverty; you are capable of standing almost any kind of maltreatment, abuse, etc. But you do not wish to know about it, isn\'t that so? You would be furious with him who told you so, and only call that person your friend who bolsters you in saying: \'No, this I cannot bear, this is beyond my strength, etc.","Father in Heaven! When the thought of thee wakes in our hearts let it not awaken like a frightened bird that flies about in dismay, but like a child waking from its sleep with a heavenly smile.","Man is spirit. But what is spirit? Spirit is the self. But what is the self? The self is a relation which relates itself to itself.","Christians remind me of schoolboys who want to look up the answers to their math problems in the back of the book rather than work them through.","A good decision is our will to do everything we can within our power. It means to serve God with all we\'ve got, be it little or much. Every person can do that.","Job endured everything - until his friends came to comfort him, then he grew impatient.","In the eyes of God, the infinite spirit, all the millions that have lived and now live do not make a crowd. He only sees each individual","It takes moral courage to grieve; it requires religious courage to rejoice.","To grumble about the world and its unhappiness is always easier than to beat one\'s breast and groan over oneself.","The more a man can forget, the greater the number of metamorphoses which his life can undergo; the more he can remember, the more divine his life becomes.","People try to persuade us that the objections against Christianity spring from doubt. That is a complete misunderstanding. The objections against Christianity spring from insubordination, the dislike of obedience, rebellion against all authority. As a result, people have hitherto been beating the air in their struggle against objections, because they have fought intellectually with doubt instead of fighting morally with rebellion.","God has given each of us our \\"marching order.\\" Our purpose here on Earth is to find those orders and carry them out. Those orders acknowledge our special gifts.","Personality is only ripe when a man has made the truth his own.","What looks like politics, and imagines itself to be political, will one day unmask itself as a religious movement.","The greatest hazard of all, losing one\u2019s self, can occur very quietly in the world, as if it were nothing at all. No other loss can occur so quietly; any other loss - an arm, a leg, five dollars, a wife, etc. - is sure to be noticed.","That is the road we all have to take - over the Bridge of Sight into eternity.","Faith is holding onto uncertainties with passionate conviction.","... the more one needs God the more perfect he is. To need God is nothing to be ashamed of but is perfection itself. It is the saddest thing in the world if a human being goes through life without discovering that he needs God!","Seek first God\'s Kingdom, that is, become like the lilies and the birds, become perfectly silent - then shall the rest be added unto you.","No one is so terribly deceived as he who does not himself suspect it.","Where there are two people, there is untruth.","Christendom has done away with Christianity without being quite aware of it.","To be a teacher in the right sense is to be a learner. I am not a teacher, only a fellow student.","Therefore do not deceive yourself! Of all deceivers fear most yourself!","There is no greater evil one can suffer than to hate reasonable discourse.","Boredom is the root of all evil - the despairing refusal to be oneself.","It is easy to see, though it scarcely needs to be pointed out, since it is involved in the fact that Reason is set aside, that faith is not a form of knowledge; for all knowledge is either a knowledge of the eternal, excluding the temporal and historical as indifferent, or it is pure historical knowledge. No knowledge can have for its object the absurdity that the eternal is the historical.","Faith is the highest passion in a human being. Many in every generation may not come that far, but none comes further.","To pace about, looking to obtain status, looking to attain \'importance\' - I can think of nothing more ridiculous.","It seems essential, in relationships and all tasks, that we concentrate only on what is most significant and important.","To the Christian, love is the works of love. To say that love is a feeling or anything of the kind is an unchristian conception of love. That is the aesthetic definition and therefore fits the erotic and everything of that nature. But to the Christian love is the works of love. Christ\'s love was not an inner feeling, a full heart and what not, it was the work of love which was his life.","Out of love, God becomes man. He says: \'See, here is what it is to be a human being\'.","It is tragic-comic to see that all this knowledge and understanding exercises no power at all over men\'s lives, that their lives do not express in the remotest way what they have understood, but rather the opposite.","O Luther, you had 95 theses . . . The matter is far more terrible-there is only one thesis. The Christianity of the New Testament does not exist at all. Here there is nothing to reform.","Faith is the highest passion in a man.","God is present in the moment of choice, not in order to watch but in order to be chosen. Therefore, each person must choose. Terrible is the battle, in a person\'s innermost being, between God and the world. The crowning risk involved lies in the possession of choice.","Why I so much prefer autumn to spring is that in the autumn one looks at heaven--in the spring at the earth.","Philosophy is perfectly right in saying that life must be understood backward. But then one forgets the other clause - that it must be lived forward. The more one thinks through this clause, the more one concludes that life in temporality never becomes properly understandable, simply because never at any time does one get perfect repose to take the stance - backward.","With respect to physical existence, one needs little, and to the degree that one needs less, the more perfect one is.","Take a book, the poorest one written, but read it with the passion that it is the only book you will read. Ultimately, you will read everything out of it, that is, as much as there was in yourself, and you could never get more out of reading, even if you read the best of books.","Only when it is a duty to love, only then is love eternally and happily secured against despair.","It is so hard to believe because it is so hard to obey.","To stand on one leg and prove God\'s existence is a very different thing from going on one\'s knees and thanking him.","I would have perished had I not perished.","The difference between a man who faces death for the sake of an idea and an imitator who goes in search of martyrdom is that whilst the former expresses his idea most fully in death it is the strange feeling of bitterness which comes from failure that the latter really enjoys; the former rejoices in his victory, the latter in his suffering.","I believe that there is a longing in my soul that searches the whole world.","The highest of all is not to understand the highest but to act upon it.","It is modest of the nightingale not to require anyone to listen to it; but it is also proud of the nightingale not to care whether any one listens to it or not.","What if everything in the world were a misunderstanding, what if laughter were really tears?","It was not to save a nation that Abraham went to sacrifice Isaac, nor to appease angry gods... Then why does Abraham do it? For God\'s sake... He does it for the sake of God because God demands proof of his faith... He was not justified by being virtuous, but by being an individual submitted to God in faith.","Whoever has learned to be anxious in the right way has learned the ultimate.","Don\'t you know that a midnight hour comes when everyone has to take off his mask? Do you think life always lets itself be trifled with? Do you think you can sneak off a little before midnight to escape this?","You wanted God\'s ideas about what was best for you to coincide with your ideas, but you also wanted him to be the almighty Creator of heaven and earth so that he could properly fulfill your wish. And yet, if he were to share your ideas, he would cease to be the almighty Father.","Deep within every man there lies the dread of being alone in the world, forgotten by God, overlooked among the tremendous household of millions and millions.","...there is one thing that all Satan\'s cunning and all the snares of temptation cannot take by surprise - an undivided will.","It is a wonderful thing to see a first-rate philosopher at prayer. Tough-minded thinking and tenderhearted reverence are friends, not enemies. We have for too long separated the head from the heart, and we are the lesser for it. We love God with the mind and we love God with the heart. In reality, we are descending with the mind into the heart and there standing before God in ceaseless wonder and endless praise. As the mind and the heart work in concert, a kind of loving rationality pervades all we say and do. This brings unity to us and glory to God.","A genius may perhaps be a century ahead of his age and hence stands there as a paradox, but in the end, the race will assimilate what was once a paradox, so it is no longer paradoxical.","People generally think that it is the world, the environment, external relationships, which stand in one\'s way, in the way of ones\' good fortune... and at bottom it is always man himself that stands in his own way.","If I had a humble spirit in my service who, when I asked for a glass of water, brought me the world\'s costliest wines blended in a chalice, I should dismiss him, in order to teach him that my pleasure consists, not in what I enjoy, but in having my own way.","There are two kinds of geniuses. The characteristic of the one is roaring, but the lightning is meagre and rarely strikes; the other kind is characterized by reflection by which it constrains itself or restrains the roaring. But the lightning is all the more intense; with the speed and sureness of lightning it hits the selected particular points - and is fatal.","I feel as if I were a piece in a game of chess, when my opponent says of it: That piece cannot be moved.","Not just in commerce but in the world of ideas too our age is putting on a veritable clearance sale. Everything can be had so dirt cheap that one begins to wonder whether in the end anyone will want to make a bid.","This age will die not as a result of some evil, but from a lack of passion.","The most common despair is...not choosing, or willing, to be oneself...[but] the deepest form of despair is to choose to be another than oneself.","For he who loves God without faith reflects on himself, while the person who loves God in faith reflects on God.","However much one generation learns from another, it can never learn from its predecessor the genuinely human factor. In this respect every generation begins afresh. Thus no generation has learned from another how to love, no generation can begin other than at the beginning.","The idea of demonstrating that this unknown something [God] exists, could scarcely suggest itself to Reason. For if God does not exist it would of course be impossible to prove it, and if he does exist it would be folly to attempt it.","In the end, therefore, money will be the one thing people will desire, which is moreover only representative, an abstraction. Nowadays a young man hardly envies anyone his gifts, his art, the love of a beautiful girl, or his fame; he only envies him his money. Give me money, he will say, and I am saved...He would die with nothing to reproach himself with, and under the impression that if only he had had the money he might really have lived and might even have achieved something great.","In addition to my other numerous acquaintances, I have one more intimate confidant. ... My depression is the most faithful mistress I have known - no wonder, then, that I return the love.","It was completely fruitless to quarrel with the world, whereas the quarrel with oneself was occasionally fruitful and always, she had to admit, interesting.","Since boredom advances and boredom is the root of all evil, no wonder, then, that the world goes backwards, that evil spreads. This can be traced back to the very beginning of the world. The gods were bored; therefore they created human beings.","And when the hourglass has run out, the hourglass of temporality, when the noise of secular life has grown silent and its restless or ineffectual activism has come to an end, when everything around you is still, as it is in eternity, then eternity asks you and every individual in these millions and millions about only one thing: whether you have lived in despair or not.","With respect to love we speak continually about perfection and the perfect person. With respect to love Christianity also speaks continually about perfection and the perfect person. Alas, but we men talk about finding the perfect person in order to love him. Christianity speaks about being the perfect person who limitlessly loves the person he sees.","Intelligence has got the upper hand to such an extent that it transforms the real task into an unreal trick and reality into a play.","A human being is a spirit. But what is spirit? Spirit is the self. But what is self? The self is a relation that relates itself to itself or is the relation\'s relating itself to itself in the relation.","Let others mock at you, oppose you, when you are under the influence of any passion; do not be in the least offended with those who mock at or oppose you, for they do you good; crucify your self-love and acknowledge the wrong, the error of your heart. But have the deepest pity for those who mock at words and works of faith and piety, of righteousness; for those who oppose the good which you are doing... God preserve you - getting exasperated at them.","One must not think slightingly of the paradoxical\u2026for the paradox is the source of the thinker\u2019s passion, and the thinker without a paradox is like a lover without feeling: a paltry mediocrity.","The stone that was rolled before Christ\'s tomb might appropriately be called the philosopher\'s stone because its removal gave not only the pharisees but, now for 1800 years, the philosophers so much to think about.","Without risk, faith is an impossibility.","Any truth is only true up to a certain point. When one oversteps the mark, it becomes a non-truth.","Had I to carve an inscription on my tombstone I would ask for none other than \\"The Individual.\\"","Worldly wisdom thinks that love is a relationship between man and man. Christianity teaches that love is a relationship between man-God-man, that is, that God is the middle term.","A man who cannot seduce men cannot save them either.","...it is not the obscure passages in Scripture that bind you but the ones you understand. With these you are to comply at once. If you understood only one passage in all of Scripture, well, then you must do that first of all. It will be this passage God asks you about. Do not first sit down and ponder the obscure passages. God\'s Word is given in order that you shall act according to it, not that you gain expertise in interpreting it.","It is very dangerous to go into eternity with possibilities which one has oneself prevented from becoming realities. A possibility is a hint from God. One must follow it.","My standpoint is armed neutrality.","Human relations are like the irregular verbs in a number of languages where nearly all verbs are irregular.","If I am capable of grasping God objectively, I do not believe, but precisely because I cannot do this I must believe. If I wish to preserve myself in faith I must constantly be intent upon holding fast the objective uncertainty so as to remain out upon the deep, over seventy thousand fathoms of water, still preserving my faith.","No time of life is so beautiful as the early days of love, when with every meeting, every glance, one fetches something new home to rejoice over.","This, then, is the ultimate paradox of thought: to want to discover something that thought itself cannot think.","Whoever thou art, whatever in other respects thy life may be, my friend, by ceasing to take part (if ordinarily thou doest) in the public worship of God, as it now is (with the claim that it is the Christianity of the New Testament), thou hast constantly one guilt the less, and that a great one: thou dost not take part in treating God as a fool by calling that the Christianity of the New Testament which is not the Christianity of the New Testament.","When you say \'Yes\' or promise something, you can very easily deceive yourself and others also, as if you had already done what you promised. It is easy to think that by making a promise you have at least done part of what you promised to do, as if the promise itself were something of value. Not at all! In fact, when you do not do what you promise, it is a long way back to the truth.","Trouble is the common denominator of living. It is the great equalizer.","Christianity demands the crucifixion of the intellect.","You train yourself in the art of being mysterious to everyone. My dear friend! What if there were no one, who cared about guessing your riddle, what pleasure would you then take in it?","Dread is a womanish debility in which freedom swoons. Psychologically speaking, the fall into sin always occurs in impotence. But dread is at the same time the most egotistic thing.","The ever increasing intensity of despair depends upon the degree of consciousness or is proportionate to this increase: the greater the degree of consciousness, the more intensive the despair. This is everywhere apparent, most clearly in despair at its maximum and minimum. The devil\'s despair is the most intensive despair, for the devil is sheer spirit and hence unqualified consciousness and transparency; there is no obscurity in the devil that could serve as a mitigating excuse. Therefore, his despair is the most absolute defiance. . . .","I have just now come from a party where I was its life and soul; witticisms streamed from my lips, everyone laughed and admired me, but I went away - yes, the dash should be as long as the radius of the earth\'s orbit \u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014 and wanted to shoot myself.","There is something almost cruel about the Christian\'s being placed in a world which in every way wants to pressure him to do the opposite of what God bids him to do.","Oh, can I really believe the poet\'s tales, that when one first sees the object of one\'s love, one imagines one has seen her long ago, that all love like all knowledge is remembrance, that\\nlove too has its prophecies in the individual.","With the daguerreotype, everyone will be able to have their portrait taken . . . and at the same time everything is being done to make us all look exactly the same.","Busyness, keeping up with others, hustling hither and yon, makes it almost impossible for an individual to form a heart.","If anyone on the verge of action should judge himself according to the outcome, he would never begin. Even though the result may gladden the whole world, that cannot help the hero; for he knows the result only when the whole thing is over, and that is not how he became a hero, but by virtue of the fact that he began.","To defend something is always to discredit it. Let a man have a warehouse full of gold, let him be willing to give away a ducat to every one of the poor - but let him also be stupid enough to begin this charitable undertaking of his with a defense in which he offers three good reasons in justification; and it will almost come to the point of people finding it doubtful whether indeed he is doing something good. But now for Christianity. Yes, the person who defends that has never believed in it.","If I am capable of grasping God objectively, I do not believe, but precisely because I cannot do this I must believe.","Knowledge of the truth I may perhaps have attained to; happiness certainly not. What shall I do? Accomplish something in the world, men tell me. Shall I then publish my grief to the world, contribute one more proof for the wretchedness and misery of existence, perhaps discover a new flaw in human life, hitherto unnoticed? I might then reap the rare reward of becoming famous, like the man who discovered the spots on Jupiter. I prefer, however, to keep silent.","Death induces the sensual person to say: Let us eat and drink, because tomorrow we shall die - but this is sensuality\'s cowardly lust for life, that contemptible order of things where one lives in order to eat and drink instead of eating and drinking in order to live.","...a human being not only can choose but... he must choose... for in this way God retains His honor while at the same time has a fatherly concern for humankind. Though God has lowered Himself to being that which can be chosen, yet each person must on his part choose. God is not mocked. Therefore the matter stands thus: If a person avoids choosing, this is the same as the presumption of choosing the world.","Pain reconciles one to existence. Infinite resignation is that shirt in the old fable. The thread is spun with tears, bleached by tears, the shirt sewn in tears, but then it also gives better protection than iron. The secret in life is that everyone must sew it for himself.","It is perfectly true, as philosophers say, that life must be understood backwards. But they forget the other proposition, that it must be lived forwards.","The great trick with a woman is to get rid of her while she think\'s she\'s rid of you.","I have only one friend, and that is echo. Why is it my friend? Because I love my sorrow, and echo does not take it away from me. I have only one confidant, and that is the silence of night. Why is it my confidant? Because it remains silent.","It is quite true what Philosophy says: that Life must be understood backwards. But that makes one forget the other saying: that it must be lived\u2014forwards. The more one ponders this, the more it comes to mean that life in the temporal existence never becomes quite intelligible, precisely because at no moment can I find complete quiet to take the backward- looking position.","Genius never desires what does not exist.","Death is not earnest in the same way the eternal is. To the earnestness of death belongs precisely that remarkable capacity for awakening, that resonance of a profound mockery which, detached from the thought of the eternal, is an empty and often brash jest, but together with the thought of the eternal is just what it should be, utterly different from the insipid solemness which least of all captures and holds a thought with tension like that of death.","It goes against the grain for me to do what so often happens, to speak inhumanly about the great as if a few millennia were an immense distance. I prefer to speak humanly about it, as if it happened yesterday, and let only the greatness itself be the distance.","Purity of heart is to will one thing.","I stick my finger into existence and it smells of nothing.","I stick my finger into existence.. it smells of nothing. Where am I? Who am I? What is this thing called the world? What does this word mean?","A man\'s personality is matured only when he appropriates the truth, whether it is spoken by Balaam\'s ass or a sniggering wag or an apostle or an angel.","What a misfortune to be a woman! And yet, the worst misfortune is not to understand what a misfortune it is.","As I stood alone and forsaken, and the power of the sea and the battle of the elements reminded me of my own nothingness, and on the other hand, the sure flight of the birds recalled the words spoken by Christ: Not a sparrow shall fall on the ground without your Father: then, all at once, I felt how great and how small I was; then did those two mighty forces, pride and humility, happily unite in friendship.","You should therefore say: alone in one\'s boat, alone with one\'s care, alone with one\'s despair, which one is craven enough to want rather to keep than submit to the pain of being healed.","...my soul always reverts to the Old Testament and to Shakespeare. There at least one feels that it\'s human beings talking. There people hate, people love, people murder their enemy and curse his descendants through all generations, there people sin.","Men are not on such intimate terms with the sublime that they really can believe in it","In the life of the individual when love awakens it is older than everything else, because when it exists it seems as if it has existed for a long time; it presupposes itself back into the distant past until all searching ends in the inexplicable origin.","The crucial thing is to find a truth which is truth for me, to find the idea for which I am willing to live and die.","This is the miracle of life:  that each person who heeds him or herself knows what no scientist can ever know:  who he or she is.","My melancholy is the most faithful sweetheart I have had.","One should be an enigma not just to others but to oneself too. I study myself. When I\'m tired of that I light a cigar to pass the time, and think: God only knows what the good Lord really meant with me, or what He meant to make of me.","It is impossible to exist without passion","Every mental act is composed of doubt and belief, but it is belief that is the positive, it is belief that sustains thought and holds the world together.","Now, with God\'s help, I shall become myself.","Human justice is very prolix, and yet at times quite mediocre; divine justice is more concise and needs no information from the prosecution, no legal papers, no interrogation of witnesses, but makes the guilty one his own informer and helps him with eternity\'s memory.","The thing is to understand myself: the thing is to find a truth which is true for me, to find the idea for which I can live and die. That is what I now recognize as the most important thing.","Irony is a disciplinarian feared only by those who do not know it, but cherished by those who do. He who does not understand irony and has no ear for its whispering lacks of what might called the absolute beginning of the personal life. He lacks what at moments is indispensable for the personal life, lacks both the regeneration and rejuvenation, the cleaning baptism of irony that redeems the soul from having its life in finitude though living boldly and energetically in finitude.","It is the duty of the human understanding to understand that there are things which it cannot understand, and what those things are.  Human understanding has vulgarly occupied itself with nothing but understanding, but if it would only take the trouble to understand itself at the same time it would simply have to posit the paradox.","Every human being is tried this way in the active service of expectancy. Now comes the fulfillment and relieves him, but soon he is again placed on reconnaissance for expectancy; then he is again relieved, but as long as there is any future for him, he has not yet finished his service. And while human life goes on this way in very diverse expectancy, expecting very different things according to different times and occasions and in different frames of mind, all life is again one nightwatch of expectancy.","Instruction begins when you, the teacher, learn from the learner; put yourself in his place so that you may understand . . . what he learns and the way he understands it.","Old age realizes the dreams of youth: look at Dean Swift; in his youth he built an asylum for the insane, in his old age he was himself an inmate.","I do not care for anything. I do not care to ride, for the exercise is too violent. I do not care to walk, walking is too strenuous. I do not care to lie down, for I should either have to remain lying, and I do not care to do that, or I should have to get up again, and I do not care to do that either. Summa summarum: I do not care at all.","You love the accidental. A smile from a pretty girl in an interesting situation, a stolen glance, that is what you are hunting for, that is a motif for your aimless fantasy. You who always pride yourself on being an observateur must, in return, put up with becoming an object of observation. Ah, you are a strange fellow, one moment a child, the next an old man; one moment you are thinking most earnestly about the most important scholarly problems, how you will devote your life to them, and the next you are a lovesick fool. But you are a long way from marriage.","What is a poet? An unhappy man who hides deep anguish in his heart, but whose lips are so formed that when the sigh and cry pass through them, it sounds like lovely music.... And people flock around the poet and say: \'Sing again soon\' - that is, \'May new sufferings torment your soul but your lips be fashioned as before, for the cry would only frighten us, but the music, that is blissful.","Death cannot explain itself. The earnestness consists precisely in this, that the observer must explain it to himself.","Affliction is able to drown out every earthly voice. . . but the voice of eternity within a person it cannot drown.","If there were no eternal consciousness in a man, if at the bottom of everything there were only a wild ferment, a power that twisting in dark passions produced everything great or inconsequential; if an unfathomable, insatiable emptiness lay hid beneath everything, what would life be but despair?","It will be easy for us the first time we receive that ball of yarn from Ariadne (love) and then go through all the mazes of the labyrinth (life) and kill the monster. But how many there are who plunge into life (the labyrinth) without taking that precaution?","It is the normal state of the human heart to try to build its identity around something besides God.","The more men believe an idea to be true the greater the likelihood that the idea is mistaken. Those who are right usually stand alone.","That which is truly human no generation learns from the one before it. No generation learns from another how to love. No generation has a shorter task assigned to it except insofar as the previous generation shirked its task and deluded itself.","It is perhaps the misfortune of my life that I am interested in far too much but not decisively in any one thing; all my interests are not subordinated in one but stand on an equal footing.","It is only all too easy to understand the requirements contained in God\'s Word (\'Give all your goods to the poor.\' \'If anyone strikes you on the right cheek, turn the left.\' \'If anyone takes your coat, let him have your cloak also. Rejoice always.\' \'Count it sheer joy when you meet various temptations\' etc.). The most ignorant, poor creature cannot honestly deny being able to understand God\'s requirements. But it is tough on the flesh to will to understand it and to then act accordingly. It is not a question of interpretation, but action.","May new sufferings torment your soul.","Take it and return it: the kiss of love.","I go fishing for a thousand monsters in the depths of my own self","...why bother remembering a past that cannot be made into a present?","Reflection is not the evil; but a reflective condition and the deadlock which it involves, by transforming the capacity for action into a means of escape from action, is both corrupt and dangerous, and leads in the end to a retrograde movement.","What a difference! Under the esthetic sky, everything is buoyant, beautiful, transient! when ethics arrives on the scene, everything becomes harsh, angular and infinitely boring","The absurd . . . the fact that with God all things are possible. The absurd is not one of the factors which can be discriminated within the proper compass of the understanding: it is not identical with the improbable, the unexpected, the unforeseen.","My life is absolutely meaningless. When I consider the different periods into which it falls, it seems like the word Schnur in the dictionary, which means in the first place a string, in the second, a daughter-in-law. The only thing lacking is that the word Schnur should mean in the third place a camel, in the fourth, a dust-brush.","Whoever has the world\'s treasures has them no matter how he got them. In the world of the spirit it is otherwise.","There can be no faith without risk.","I am so stupid that I cannot understand philosophy; the antithesis of this is that philosophy is so clever that it cannot comprehend my stupidity. These antitheses are mediated in a higher unity; in our common stupidity.","The gods were bored and so they created man.  Adam was bored because he was alone, so Eve was created.  Thus boredom entered the world, and increased in proportion to the increase in population.  Adam was bored alone, then Adam and Eve were bored together; them Adam and Eve and Cain and Abel were bored en famille; then the population of the world increased, and the people were bored en masse.","I am convinced that God is love, this thought has for me a primitive lyrical validity. When it is present to me, I am unspeakably blissful, when it is absent, I long for it more vehemently than does the lover for his object.","My sorrow is my castle.","The thinker without a paradox is like a lover without a feeling: a paltry mediocrity.","Talent warms-up the given (as they say in cookery) and makes it apparent; genius brings something new. But our time lets talent pass for genius. They want to abolish the genius, deify the genius, and let talent forge ahead.","To venture causes anxiety, but not to venture is to lose one\'s self.... And to venture in the highest is precisely to be conscious of one\'s self.","The individual (no matter how well-meaning he might be, no matter how much strength he might have, if only he would use it) does not have the passion to rip himself away from either the coils of Reflection or the seductive ambiguities of Reflection; nor do the surroundings and times have any events or passions, but rather provide a negative setting of a habit of reflection, which plays with some illusory project only to betray him in the end with a way out: it shows him that the most clever thing to do is nothing at all.","Concepts, like individuals, have their histories and are just as incapable of withstanding the ravages of time as are individuals. But in and through all this they retain a kind of homesickness for the scenes of their childhood.","...even the richest personality is nothing before he has chosen himself, and on the other hand even what one might call the poorest personality is everything when he has chosen himself; for the great thing is not to be this or that but to be oneself, and this everyone can be if he wills it.","Most people believe that the Christian commandments are intentionally a little too severe","A \'no\' does not hide anything, but a \'yes\' very easily becomes a deception.","The person who praises God is on the tracks of justice.","Marriage brings one into fatal connection with custom and tradition, and traditions and customs are like the wind and weather, altogether incalculable.","Boredom rests upon the nothingness that winds its way through existence; its giddiness, like that which comes from gazing down into an infinite abyss, is infinite.","Compared with the person who is conscious of his despair, the despairing individual who is ignorant of his despair is simply a negativity further away from the truth and deliverance. . . . Yet ignorance is so far from breaking the despair or changing despair to nondespairing that it can in fact be the most dangerous form of despair. . . . An individual is furthest from being conscious of himself as spirit when he is ignorant of being in despair. But precisely this-not to be conscious of oneself as spirit-is despair, which is spiritlessness. . . .","Most people live dejectedly in worldly joys or sorrows. They sit on the sidelines and do not join the dance.","Truth is not introduced into the individual from without, but was within him all the time.","There are many people who reach their conclusions about life like schoolboys: they cheat their master by copying the answer out of a book without having worked the sum out for themselves.","When you were called, did you answer or did you not? Perhaps softly and in a whisper?","And then the spirit brings hope, hope in the strictest Christian sense, hope which is hoping against hope. For an immediate hope exists in every person; it may be more powerfully alive in one person than in another; but in death every hope of this kind dies and turns into hopelessness. Into this night of hopelessness (it is death that we are describing) comes the life-giving spirit and brings hope, the hope of eternity. It is against hope, for there was no longer any hope for that merely natural hope; this hope is therefore a hope contrary to hope.","Christianity does not oppose debauchery and uncontrollable passions and the like as much as it opposes... flat mediocrity, this nauseating atmosphere, this homey, civil togetherness, where admittedly great crimes, wild excesses, and powerful aberrations cannot easily occur - but where God\'s unconditional demand has even greater difficulty in accomplishing what it requires: the majestic obedience of submission.","The reign of the tyrant ends with his death, and the reign of the martyr starts with it.","Irony is the birth-pangs of the objective mind (based upon the misrelationship, discovered by the I , between existence and the idea of existence). Humor is the birth -pangs of the absolute mind (based upon the misrelationship, discovered by the I , between the I and the idea of the I .","What is existence for but to be laughed at if men in their twenties have already attained the utmost?","If I were to wish for anything, I should not wish for wealth and power, but for the passionate sense of the potential, for the eye which, ever young and ardent, sees the possible. Pleasure disappoints, possibility never. And what wine is so sparkling, what so fragrant, what so intoxicating, as possibility!","Men who not religious or artists are fools.","Irony is the cultivation of the spirit and therefore follows next after immediacy; then comes the ethicist, then the humourist, then the religious person.","The resolving of the ethical, is freedom; the negative resolution also has this, but the freedom, blank and bare, is as if tongue-tied, hard to express, and generally has something hard in its nature. Falling in love, however, promptly sets it to music, even if this composition contains a very difficult passage.","Do you know of any more overwhelming and humbling expression for God\'s condescension and extravagance towards us human beings than that He places Himself, so to say, on the same level of choice with the world, just so that we may be able to choose; that God, if language dare speak thus, woos humankind - that He, the eternally strong one, woos sapless humanity? Yet, how insignificant is the young lover\'s choice between her pursuers by comparison with this choice between God and the world.","Irony is a disciplinarian feared only by those who do not know it, but cherished by those who do","The task must be made difficult, for only the difficult inspires the noble-hearted.","As the arrow, loosed from the bow by the hand of the practiced archer, does not rest till it has reached the mark, so men pass from God to God. He is the mark for which they have been created, and they do not rest till they find their rest in him.","An individual in despair despairs over something. . . . In despairing over something, he really despair[s] over himself, and now he wants to get rid of himself. Consequently, to despair over something is still not despair proper. . . . To despair over oneself, in despair to will to be rid of oneself-this is the formula for all despair.","There are, as is known, insects that die in the moment of fertilization. So it is with all joy: life\'s highest, most splendid moment of enjoyment is accompanied by death.","It belongs to the imperfection of everything human that man can only attain his desire by passing through its opposite.","How ironical that it is by means of speech that man can degrade himself below the level of dumb creation -- for a chatterbox is truly of a lower category than a dumb creature.","Genius, like a thunderstorm, comes up against the wind.","All moral elevation consists first and foremost of being weaned from the momentary.","Out of love for mankind, and out of despair at my embarrassing situation, seeing that I had accomplished nothing and was unable to make anything easier than it had already been made, and moved by a genuine interest in those who make everything easy, I conceived it as my task to create difficulties everywhere.","When all combine in every way to make everything easier, people will want difficulty. I conceived it as my task to make difficulties everywhere.","The truth is a snare: you cannot have it, without being caught. You cannot have the truth in such a way that you catch it, but only in such a way that it catches you.","He who does not know how to encircle a girl so that she loses sight of everything he does not want her to see, he who does not know how to poetize himself into a girl so that it is from her that everything proceeds as he wants it-he is and remains a bungler","In order to swim one takes off all one\'s clothes--in order to aspire to the truth one must undress in a far more inward sense, divest oneself of all one\'s inward clothes, of thoughts, conceptions, selfishness etc., before one is sufficiently naked.","Only one deception is possible in the infinite sense, self-deception.","A curiously interested observer sees a great deal, a scientifically interested observer is worthy of all honor, and anxiously interested observer sees what others do not see, but a crazy observer sees perhaps the most, his observation is more intense and more persistent, just as the senses of certain animals are sharper than those of man.","Absolute passion cannot be understood by a third party.","All essential knowledge relates to existence, or only such knowledge as has an essential relationship to existence is essential knowledge.","Just as in the great moment of resignation one does not mediate but chooses, now the task is to gain proficiency in repeating the impassioned choice and, existing, to express it in existence.","Learning to know anxiety is an adventure which every man has to affront if he would not go to perdition either by not having known anxiety or by sinking under it. He therefore who has leaned rightly to be in anxiety has learned the most important thing.","One is not unpopular because he uses peculiar expressions; that just so happens; such terms become a fad, and by and by everybody, down to the last simpleton, uses them. But a person who follows through an idea in his mind is, and always will be, essentially unpopular. That is why Socrates was unpopular, though he did not use any special terms, for to grasp and hold his \'ignorance\' requires greater vital effort than understanding the whole of Hegel\'s philosophy.","No grand inquisitor has in readiness such terrible tortures as has anxiety and no spy knows how to attack more artfully the man he suspects, choosing the instant when he is weakest; nor knows how to lay traps where he will be caught and ensnared as anxiety knows how, and no sharp-witted judge knows how to interrogate, to examine the accused, as anxiety does, which never lets him escape.","What I really need is to get clear about what I must do, not what I must know, except insofar as knowledge must precede every act. What matters is to find a purpose, to see what it really is that God wills that I shall do; the crucial thing is to find a truth which is truth for me, to find the idea for which I am willing to live and die.","Maturity consists in the discovery that there comes a critical moment where everything is reversed, after which the point becomes to understand more and more that there is something which cannot be understood.","...he who always hopes for the best becomes old, deceived by life, and he who is always prepared for the worst becomes old prematurely; but he who has faith, retains eternal youth.","It is a very curious thing about superstition. One would expect that the man who had once seen his morbid dreams were not fulfilled would abandon them for the future; but on the contrary they grow even stronger just as the love of gambling increases in a man who has once lost in a lottery.","Shows itself in the notion that what may be objectively true may in the mouth of certain people become false.","Dread is a sympathetic antipathy and an antipathetic sympathy.","In the deepest sense, the being in a state of sin is the sin, the particular sins are not the continuation of sin, they are expressions of its continuation.","Of all ridiculous things the most ridiculous seems to me, to be busy \u2014 to be a man who is brisk about his food and his work. Therefore, whenever I see a fly settling, in the decisive moment, on the nose of such a person of affairs; or if he is spattered with mud from a carriage which drives past him in still greater haste; or the drawbridge opens up before him; or a tile falls down and knocks him dead, then I laugh heartily.","This fact, that the opposite of sin is by no means virtue, has been overlooked. The latter is partly a pagan view, which is content with a merely human standard, and which for that very reason does not know what sin is, that all sin is before God. No, the opposite of sin is faith.","Worship isn\'t God\'s show. God is the audience. God\'s watching. The congregation, they are the actors in this drama. Worship is their show. And the minister is just reminding the people of their forgotten lines.","It is intelligent to ask two questions: (1) Is it possible? (2) Can I do it?. But it is unintelligent to ask these questions: (1) Is it real? (2) Has my neighbor done it?","Imagine hidden in a simpler exterior a secret receptacle wherein the most precious treasure is deposited - there is a spring which has to be pressed, but the spring is hidden, and the pressure must have a certain strength, so that an accidental pressure would not be sufficient.  So likewise is the hope of eternity hidden in man\'s inmost parts, and affliction is the pressure. When it presses the hidden spring, and strongly enough, then the contents appear in all their glory.","Knowledge is an attitude, a passion, actually an illicit attitude. For the compulsion to know is like dipsomania, erotomania, and homicidal mania, in producing a character that is out of balance. It is not at all that the scientist goes after the truth.","What I really need is to get clear out about what I must do, not what I must know, except insofar as knowledge precedes every act.","But the life of freedom requires a beginning, and here a beginning is a resolution, and the resolution has its work and its pain-thus the beginning has its difficulty.","To despair over one\'s sins indicates that sin has become or wants to be internally consistent. It wants nothing to do with the good, does not want to be so weak as to listen occasionally to other talk. No, it insists on listening only to itself, on having dealings only with itself; it closes itself up within itself, indeed, locks itself inside one more inclosure, and protects itself against every attack or pursuit by the good by despairing over sin.","The paradox is really the pathos of intellectual life and just as only great souls are exposed to passions it is only the great thinker who is exposed to what I call paradoxes, which are nothing else than grandiose thoughts in embryo.","It occurs to me that artists go forward by going backward, something which I have nothing against intrinsically when it is a reproduced retreat - as is the case with the better artists.","About as genuine as tea made from a bit of paper which once lay in a drawer beside another piece of paper which had been used to wrap up a few tea leaves from which tea had already been made three times.","Deep within every human being there still lives the anxiety over the possibility of being alone in the world, forgotten by God, overlooked among the millions and millions in this enormous household. One keeps this anxiety at a distance by looking at the many round about who are related to him as kin and friends, but the anxiety is still there, nevertheless, and one hardly dares think of how he would feel if all this were taken away.","Adversity draws men together and produces beauty and harmony in life\'s relationships, just as the cold of winter produces ice-flowers on the window-panes, which vanish with the warmth.","My tactics were, by God\'s aid, to employ every means to make it clear what the requirement of Christianity truly is.","One could construe the life of man as a great discourse in which the various people represent different parts of speech (the same might apply to states).","It is (to describe it figuratively) as if an author were to make a slip of the pen, and as if this clerical error became conscious of being such. Perhaps this was no error but in a far higher sense was an essential part of the whole exposition. It is, then, as if this clerical error were to revolt against the author, out of hatred for him, were to forbid him to correct it, and were to say, \\"No, I will not be erased, I will stand as a witness against thee, that thou art a very poor writer.\\"","...knowing God is the condition for the sanctification of a human being by God\'s assistance and according to His intention. Wherever God is, there He is always creating... He wants to create a new human being. To need God is to become new. And to know God is the crucial thing.","Silence is the demon\'s trap, and the more one is silenced, the more terrible the demon; but silence is also the divinity\'s mutual understanding with the single individual.","The proud person always wants to do the right thing, the great thing. But because he wants to do it in his own strength, he is fighting not with man, but with God.","It is not a gain that guilt should be wholly forgotten. On the contrary, it is loss and perdition. But it is a gain to win an inner intensity of heart through a deeper and deeper inner sorrowing over guilt.","Love does not alter the beloved, it alters itself.","Where unclarity resides, there is temptation, and there it proves only too easily the stronger. Wherever there is ambiguity, wherever there is wavering, there is disobedience down at the bottom.","The present generation, wearied by its chimerical efforts, relapses into complete indolence. Its condition is that of a man who has only fallen asleep towards morning: first of all come great dreams, then a feeling of laziness, and finally a witty or clever excuse for remaining in bed.","Spiritual superiority only sees the individual. But alas, ordinarily we human beings are sensual and, therefore, as soon as it is a gathering, the impression changes - we see something abstract, the crowd, and we become different. But in the eyes of God, the infinite spirit, all the millions that have lived and now live do not make a crowd, He only sees each individual.","The extreme rarity of transitional forms in the fossil record persists as the trade secret of paleontology.","The question of immortality is of its nature not a scholarly question. It is a question welling up from the interior which the subject must put to itself as it becomes conscious of itself.","Irony limits, finitizes, and circumscribes and thereby yields truth, actuality, content; it disciplines and punishes and thereby yields balance and consistency.","To the frivolous Christianity is certainly not glad tidings, for it wishes first of all to make them serious.","In order to learn true humility (I use this expression to describe the state of mind under discussion), it is good for a person to withdraw from the turmoil of the world (we see that Christ withdrew when the people wanted to proclaim him king as well as when he had to walk the thorny path), for in life either the depressing or the elevating impression is too dominant for a true balance to come about. Here, of course, individuality is very decisive.","To be a saint is to will the one thing.","Philosophy is life\'s dry-nurse, who can take care of us - but not suckle us.","Preparation for becoming attentive to Christianity does not consist in reading many books ... but in fuller immersion in existence.","If someone who wanted to learn to dance were to say: For centuries, one generation after the other has learned the positions, and it is high time that I take advantage of this and promptly begin with the quadrille--people would presumably laugh a little at him, but in the world of spirit this is very plausible. What, then, is education? I believed it is the course the individual goes through in order to catch up with himself, and the person who will not go through this course is not much helped by being born in the most enlightened age.","Philosophy always requires something more, requires the eternal, the true, in contrast to which even the fullest existence as such is but a happy moment.","In actuality, no one ever sank so deep that he could not sink deeper, and there may be one or many who sank deeper. So it is always possible to be happy and grateful that things are not worse!","So to be sick unto death is, not to be able to die-yet not as though there were hope of life; no, the hopelessness in this case is that even the last hope, death, is not available. When death is the greatest danger, one hopes for life; but when one becomes acquainted with an even more dreadful danger, one hopes for death. So when the danger is so great that death has become one\'s hope, despair is the disconsolateness of not being able to die.","Faith is a marvel, and yet no human being is excluded from it; for that in which all human life is united is passion, and faith is a passion.","Sin is in itself separation from the good, but despair over sin is separation a second time.","I have never fought in such a way as to say: I am the true Christian, others are not Christians.","The more one suffers, the more, I believe, has one a sense for the comic. It is only by the deepest suffering that one acquires true authority in the use of the comic, an authority which by one word transforms as by magic the reasonable creature one calls man into a caricature.","Fate, then, is the nothing of anxiety.","Sin is: before God, or with the conception of God, in despair not to will to be oneself, or in despair to will to be oneself. Thus sin is intensified weakness or intensified defiance: sin is the intensification of despair. The emphasis is on before God, or with a conception of God; it is the conception of God that makes sin dialectically, ethically, and religiously what lawyers call \'aggravated\' despair.","I am so fed up and joyless that not only have I nothing to fill my soul, I cannot even conceive of anything that could possibly satisfy it - alas, not even the bliss of heaven.","What our age lacks is not reflection, but passion.","When you open the door which you shut in order to pray to God, the first person you meet as you go out is your neighbour whom you shall love. Wonderful!","Choose to be who you are. . . The individual who would become a person must at some point take over his entire being - must, that is, choose herself.","A poet is not an apostle; he drives out devils only by the power of the devil.","Leap of faith \u2013 yes, but only after reflection","It seems to be my destiny to discourse on truth, insofar as I discover it, in such a way that all possible authority is simultaneously demolished.","Faith is precisely the paradox that the single individual as the single individual is higher than the universal, is justified before it, not as inferior to it but superior - yet in such a way, please note, that it is the single individual who, after being subordinate as the single individual to the universal, now by means of the universal becomes the single individual who as the single individual is superior, that the single individual as the single individual stands in an absolute relation to the absolute.","Pleasure disappoints, possibility never. And what wine is so sparkling, who so fragrant, what so intoxicating, as possibility.","How absurd men are! They never use the liberties they have, they demand those they do not have. They have freedom of thought, they demand freedom of speech.","It is human self-renunciation when a man denies himself and the world opens up to him. But it is Christian self-renunciation when he denies himself and, because the world precisely for this shuts itself up to him, he must as one thrust out by the world seek God\'s confidence. The double-danger lies precisely in meeting opposition there where he had expected to find support, and he has to turn about twice; whereas the merely human self-resignation turns once.","I divide my time as follows: half the time I sleep, the other half I dream. I never dream when I sleep, for that would be a pity, for sleeping is the highest accomplishment of genius.","Destroy your primitivity, and you will most probably get along well in the world, maybe achieve great success--but Eternity will reject you. Follow up your primitivity, and you will be shipwrecked in temporality, but accepted by Eternity.","The present state of the world and the whole of life is diseased. If I were a doctor and were asked for my advice, I should reply, \'Create silence\'.","It requires courage not to surrender oneself to the ingenious or compassionate counsels of despair that would induce a man to eliminate himself from the ranks of the living; but it does not follow from this that every huckster who is fattened and nourished in self-confidence has more courage than the man who yielded to despair.","Far from idleness being the root of all evil, it is rather the only true good.","Just as in earthly life lovers long for the moment when they are able to breathe forth their love for each other, to let their souls blend in a soft whisper, so the mystic longs for the moment when in prayer he can, as it were, creep into God.","One can advise comfortably from a safe port.","For like a poisonous breath over the fields, like a mass of locusts over Egypt, so the swarm of excuses is a general plaque, a ruinous infection among men, that eats off the sprouts of the Eternal.","No, I won\'t leave the world--I\'ll enter a lunatic asylum and see if the profundity of insanity reveals to me the riddles of life. Idiot, why didn\'t I do that long ago, why has it taken me so long to understand what it means when the Indians honour the insane, step aside for them? Yes, a lunatic asylum--don\'t you think I may end up there?","It is a frightful satire and an epigram on the modern age that the only use it knows for solitude is to make it a punishment, a jail sentence.","Repetition is the reality and the seriousness of life.","For the sadness in legitimate humour consists in the fact that honestly and without deceit it reflects in a purely human way upon what it is to be a child.","I have, I believe, the courage to doubt everything; I have, I believe, the courage to fight against everything; but I do not have the courage to acknowledge anything, the courage to possess, to own anything.","The only analogy I have before me is Socrates. My task is a Socratic task, to revise the definition of what it is to be a Christian. For my part I do not call myself a \\"Christian\\" (thus keeping the ideal free), but I am able to make it evident that the others are still less than I.","I have only one confidant, and that is the silence of night.","There are men who are wanting in the comparative, they as a rule are the most interesting.","The paradox in Christian truth is invariably due to the fact that it is the truth that exists for God. The standard of measure and the end is superhuman; and there is only one relationship possible: faith.","If the ethical - that is, social morality- is the highest ... then no categories are needed other than the Greek philosophical categories.","Backwards understood be only can but, forwards lived be must life.","Theology sits rouged at the window and courts philosophy\'s favor, offering to sell her charms to it.","Language has time as its element; all other media have space as their element.","I begin with the principle that all men are bores. Surely no one will prove himself so great a bore as to contradict me in this.","To be lost in spiritlessness is the most terrible thing of all.","My scholarly expectation is then that I may succeed in becoming clever in philosophy in spite of my stupidity.","Most people believe that the Christian commandments, e.g. to love one\'s neighbor as oneself, are intentionally a little too severe - like setting a clock half an hour ahead to make sure of not being late in the morning.","...the reason for [this age\'s] anxiety and unrest is because in one direction, \'truth\' increases in scope and quantity - via science and technology - while in the other, certainty and confidence steadily decline. Our age is a master in developing truths while being wholly indifferent to certitude. It lacks confidence in the good.","If anyone proposes to believe, i.e., imagines himself to believe, because many good and upright people living here on the hill have believed, i.e., have said that they believedthen he is a fool, and it is essentially indifferent whether he believes on account of his own and perhaps a widely held opinion about what good and upright people believe, or believes a M\xfcnchhausen.","In a mathematical proposition, for example, the objectivity is given, but therefore its truth is also an indifferent truth.","Where am I? Who am I? How did I come to be here? What is this thing called the world?","What the philosophers have to say about reality is often as disappointing as a sign you see in a shop window, which reads Pressing Done Here. If you brought your clothes in to be pressed, you would be fooled: for the sign is only for sale.","But doubt is wily and cunning and never, as it is sometimes said to be, loud or defiant. It is unassuming and sly, not bold or assertive - and the more unassuming, the more dangerous.","The meaning lies in the appropriation.","During the first period of our lives the greatest danger is not to take the risk. When once the risk has been taken, then the greatest danger is to risk too much. By not risking at first one turns aside and serves trivialities; in the second case, by risking too much, one turns aside to the fantastic and perhaps to presumption.","...it is presumptuous ridicule of God if someone thinks that only the person who desires great wealth chooses mammon. Alas, the person who insists on having a penny without God, wants to have a penny all for himself. He thereby chooses mammon. A penny is enough, the choice is made, he has chosen mammon; that it is little makes not the slightest difference. The love of God is hatred of the world and love of the world hatred of God.","I would rather be a swineherd, understood by the swine, than a poet misunderstood by men.","Jurists say that a capital crime submerges all lesser crimes; and so it is with faith. Its absurdity makes all petty difficultiesvanish.","Irony is a qualification of subjectivity.","In the Christianity of Christendom the Cross has become something like the child\u2019s hobby-horse and trumpet.","Doubt is thought\'s despair; despair is personality\'s doubt. . . . Doubt and despair . . . belong to completely different spheres; different sides of the soul are set in motion. . . . Despair is an expression of the total personality, doubt only of thought.","Certainty... lurks at the door of faith and threatens to devour it.","Sleeping is the height of genius","Thus our own age is essentially one of understanding, and on the average, perhaps, more knowledgeable than any former generation, but it is without passion. Every one knows a great deal, we all know which way we ought to go and all the different ways we can go, but nobody is willing to move.","Pleasure disappoints; possibility never.","In my great melancholy, I loved life, for I love my melancholy.","... all comparisons injure.","Nothing is as heady as the wine of possibility","It doesn\'t occur to me at this moment to say more; another time, perhaps tomorrow, I may have more to say, but always the same thing and about the same, for only gypsies, robber gangs and swindlers follow the adage that where a person has once been he is never to go again.","Your own tactic is to train yourself in the art of becoming enigmatic to everybody. My young friend, suppose there was no one who troubld himself to guess your riddle--what joy, then, would you have in it?","Ulysses was not comely, but he was eloquent, Yet he fired two goddesses of the sea with love","Those who dream must be awakened, and the deeper the people are who slumber, or the deeper they slumber, the more important it is that they be awakened, and the more powerfully must they be awakened.","Only one human being recognized as one\'s neighbour is necessary in order to cure a man of self-love","The presence of irony does not necessarily mean that the earnestness is excluded. Only assistant professors assume that.","The self is a relation which relates itself to its own self, or it is that in the relation that the relation relates itself to its own self; the self is not the relation but that the relation relates itself to its own self.","Our age is essentially one of understanding and reflection, without passion, momentarily bursting into enthusiasm and shrewdly relapsing into repose.","If a man wants to set up as an innkeeper and he does not succeed, it is not comic. If, on the contrary, a girl asks to be allowed to set up as a prostitute and she fails, as sometimes happens, it is comic.","Humor (is) intrinsitc to Christianity.","And if something should be found, particularly in the first part of the dissertation, that one is generally not accustomed to come across in scholarly writings, the reader must forgive my jocundity, just as I, in order to lighten the burden, sometimes sing at my work.","To be a teacher does not mean simply to affirm that such a thing is so, or to deliver a lecture, etc.","I have attacked no one as not being a Christian, I have condemned no one.","No one may pride himself at being more than an individual, and no one despondently think that he is not an individual.","Spirit is the third, yet in such a way that one can speak of a synthesis only when the spirit is posited.","At one time my only wish was to be a police official. It seemed to me to be an occupation for my sleepless intriguing mind. I had the idea that there, among criminals, were people to fight: clever, vigorous, crafty fellows. Later I realized that it was good that I did not become one, for most police cases involve misery and wretchedness-not crimes and scandals.","The conclusions of passion are the only reliable ones.","Who is also aware of the tremendous risk involved in faith - when he nevertheless makes the leap of faith - this [is] subjectivity ... at its height.","A poet is an unhappy creature whose heart is tortured by deepest suffering but whose lips are so formed that when his sighs and cries stream out over them, their sound beomes like the sound of beautiful music . . . . And men flock about the poet saying, Sing for us soon again; that is to say, may new sufferings torture your soul, and may your lips continue to be formed as before.","Nowadays not even a suicide kills himself in desperation. Before taking the step he deliberates so long and so carefully that he literally chokes with thought. It is even questionable whether he ought to be called a suicide, since it is really thought which takes his life. He does not die with deliberation but from deliberation.","I do not lack the courage to think a thought whole.","To venture causes anxiety.  Not to venture is to lose oneself.","At the bottom of enmity between strangers lies indifference.","The question is asked in ignorance, by one who does not even know what can have led him to ask it.","Because of its tremendous solemnity death is the light in which great passions, both good and bad, become transparent, no longer limited by outward appearances.","I see it all perfectly; there are two possible situations \u2014 one can either do this or that. My honest opinion and my friendly advice is this: do it or do not do it \u2014 you will regret both.","Marry, and you will regret it; don\u2019t marry, you will also regret it; marry or don\u2019t marry, you will regret it either way. Laugh at the world\u2019s foolishness, you will regret it; weep over it, you will regret that too; laugh at the world\u2019s foolishness or weep over it, you will regret both. Believe a woman, you will regret it; believe her not, you will also regret it\u2026 Hang yourself, you will regret it; do not hang yourself, and you will regret that too; hang yourself or don\u2019t hang yourself, you\u2019ll regret it either way; whether you hang yourself or do not hang yourself, you will regret both. This, gentlemen, is the essence of all philosophy.","In addition to my other numerous acquaintances, I have one more intimate confidant\u2026 My depression is the most faithful mistress I have known \u2014 no wonder, then, that I return the love.","A fire broke out backstage in a theatre. The clown came out to warn the public; they thought it was a joke and applauded. He repeated it; the acclaim was even greater. I think that\'s just how the world will come to an end: to general applause from wits who believe it\'s a joke.","Many of us pursue pleasure with such breathless haste that we hurry past it.","Truth always rests with the minority, and the minority is always stronger than the majority, because the minority is generally formed by those who really have an opinion, while the strength of a majority is illusory, formed by the gangs who have no opinion \u2014 and who, therefore, in the next instant (when it is evident that the minority is the stronger) assume its opinion\u2026 while truth again reverts to a new minority.","I have just now come from a party where I was its life and soul; witticisms streamed from my lips, everyone laughed and admired me, but I went away \u2014 yes, the dash should be as long as the radius of the earth\'s orbit \u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014 and wanted to shoot myself.","It is the duty of the human understanding to understand that there are things which it cannot understand...","Listen to the cry of a woman in labor at the hour of giving birth \u2014 look at the dying man\u2019s struggle at his last extremity, and then tell me whether something that begins and ends thus could be intended for enjoyment.","The matter is quite simple. The bible is very easy to understand. But we Christians are a bunch of scheming swindlers. We pretend to be unable to understand it because we know very well that the minute we understand, we are obliged to act accordingly. Take any words in the New Testament and forget everything except pledging yourself to act accordingly. My God, you will say, if I do that my whole life will be ruined. How would I ever get on in the world? Herein lies the real place of Christian scholarship. Christian scholarship is the Church\u2019s prodigious invention to defend itself against the Bible, to ensure that we can continue to be good Christians without the Bible coming too close. Oh, priceless scholarship, what would we do without you? Dreadful it is to fall into the hands of the living God. Yes it is even dreadful to be alone with the New Testament.","Every mental act is composed of doubt and belief,but it is belief that is the positive, it is beliefthat sustains thought and holds the world together.","Do you not know that there comes a midnight hour when every one has to throw off his mask? Do you believe that life will always let itself be mocked? Do you think you can slip away a little before midnight in order to avoid this? Or are you not terrified by it? I have seen men in real life who so long deceived others that at last their true nature could not reveal itself;... In every man there is something which to a certain degree prevents him from becoming perfectly transparent to himself; and this may be the case in so high a degree, he may be so inexplicably woven into relationships of life which extend far beyond himself that he almost cannot reveal himself. But he who cannot reveal himself cannot love, and he who cannot love is the most unhappy man of all.","Idleness, we are accustomed to say, is the root of all evil. To prevent this evil, work is recommended.... Idleness as such is by no means a root of evil; on the contrary, it is truly a divine life, if one is not bored....","What is talkativeness? It is the result of doing away with the vital distinction between talking and keeping silent. Only some one who knows how to remain essentially silent can really talk--and act essentially. Silence is the essence of inwardness, of the inner life. Mere gossip anticipates real talk, and to express what is still in thought weakens action by forestalling it. But some one who can really talk, because he knows how to remain silent, will not talk about a variety of things but about one thing only, and he will know when to talk and when to remain silent. Where mere scope is concerned, talkativeness wins the day, it jabbers on incessantly about everything and nothing...In a passionate age great events (for they correspond to each other) give people something to talk about. And when the event is over, and silence follows, there is still something to remember and to think about while one remains silent. But talkativeness is afraid of the silence which reveals its emptiness.","When I was young, I forgot how to laugh in the cave of Trophonius; when I was older, I opened my eyes and beheld reality, at which I began to laugh, and since then, I have not stopped laughing. I saw that the meaning of life was to secure a livelihood, and that its goal was to attain a high position; that love\u2019s rich dream was marriage with an heiress; that friendship\u2019s blessing was help in financial difficulties; that wisdom was what the majority assumed it to be; that enthusiasm consisted in making a speech; that it was courage to risk the loss of ten dollars; that kindness consisted in saying, \u201cYou are welcome, at the dinner table; that piety consisted in going to communion once a year. This I saw, and I laughed.\u201d","The only intelligent tactical response to life\u2019s horror is to laugh defiantly at it","The same thing happened to me that, according to legend, happened to Parmeniscus, who in the Trophonean cave lost the ability to laugh but acquired it again on the island of Delos upon seeing a shapeless block that was said to be the image of the goddess Leto. When I was very young, I forgot in the Trophonean cave how to laugh; when I became an adult, when I opened my eyes and saw actuality, then I started to laugh and have never stopped laughing since that time. I saw that the meaning of life was to make a living, its goal to be- come a councilor, that the rich delight oflove was to acquire a well-to-do girl, that the blessedness of friendship was to help each other in financial difficulties, that wisdom was whatever the majority assumed it to be, that enthusiasm was to give a speech, that courage was to risk being fined ten dollars, that cordiality was to say \\"May it do you good\\" after a meal, that piety was to go to communion once a year. This I saw, and I laughed.","My melancholy is the most faithful mistress I have known; what wonder, then, that I love her in return.","\u0622\u06cc\u0627 \u0645\u0636\u062d\u06a9 \u062a\u0631 \u0627\u0632 \u0627\u06cc\u0646 \u0645\u0631\u062f\u0645 \u06cc\u0627\u0641\u062a \u0645\u06cc \u0634\u0648\u062f\u060c \u06a9\u0647 \u0647\u06cc\u0686 \u0648\u0642\u062a \u0627\u0632 \u0622\u0632\u0627\u062f\u06cc \u0627\u06cc \u06a9\u0647 \u062f\u0627\u0631\u0646\u062f \u0627\u0633\u062a\u0641\u0627\u062f\u0647 \u0646\u0645\u06cc \u06a9\u0646\u0646\u062f\u060c \u0627\u0645\u0627 \u0622\u0632\u0627\u062f\u06cc \u0627\u06cc \u06a9\u0647 \u0646\u062f\u0627\u0631\u0646\u062f \u0631\u0627 \u0645\u06cc \u0637\u0644\u0628\u0646\u062f\u061f\u0622\u0646 \u0647\u0627 \u0622\u0632\u0627\u062f\u06cc \u0627\u0646\u062f\u06cc\u0634\u0647 \u062f\u0627\u0631\u0646\u062f\u060c \u0648 \u0622\u0632\u0627\u062f\u06cc \u0628\u06cc\u0627\u0646 \u0645\u06cc \u0637\u0644\u0628\u0646\u062f. \u0622\u0632\u0627\u062f\u06cc \u0628\u06cc\u0627\u0646 \u0645\u06cc \u0637\u0644\u0628\u0646\u062f \u062a\u0627 \u062c\u0628\u0631\u0627\u0646\u06cc \u0628\u0627\u0634\u062f \u0628\u0631\u0627\u06cc \u0622\u0632\u0627\u062f\u06cc \u0627\u0646\u062f\u06cc\u0634\u0647 \u0627\u06cc \u06a9\u0647 \u062a\u0642\u0631\u06cc\u0628\u0627\u064b \u0647\u06cc\u0686 \u0648\u0642\u062a \u0628\u0647 \u06a9\u0627\u0631\u0634 \u0646\u0645\u06cc \u0628\u0631\u0646\u062f.","I have the courage, I believe, to doubt everything; I have the courage, I believe, to fight with everything; but I have not the courage to know anything; not the courage to possess, to own anything. Most people complain that the world is so prosaic, that life is not like romance, where opportunities are always so favorable. I complain that life is not like romance, where one had hard-hearted parents and nixies and trolls to fight, and enchanted princesses to free. What are all such enemies taken together, compared with the pale, bloodless, tenacious, nocturnal shapes with which I fight, and to whom I give life and substance?","No! No one who was great in the world will be forgotten, but everyone was great in his own way, and everyone in proportion to the greatness of that which he loved. He who loved himself became great by virtue of himself, and he who loved other men became great by his devotedness, but he who loved God became the greatest of all. Everyone shall be remembered, but everyone became great in proportion to his expectancy. One became great by expecting the possible, another by expecting the eternal; but he who expected the impossible became the greatest of all. Everyone shall be remembered, but everyone was great wholly in proportion to the magnitude of that with which he struggled. For he who struggled with the world became great by conquering the world, and he who struggled with himself became great by conquering himself, but he who struggled with God became the greatest of all. Thus did they struggle in the world, man against man, one against thousands, but he who struggled with God was the greatest of all. Thus did they struggle on earth: there was one who conquered everything by his power, and there was one who conquered God by his powerlessness. There was one who relied upon himself and gained everything; there was one who in the security of his own strength sacrificed everything; but the one who believed God was the greatest of all. There was one who was great by virtue of his power, and one who was great by virtue of his hope, and one who was great by virtue of his love, but Abraham was the greatest of all, great by that power whose strength is powerlessness, great by that wisdom which is foolishness, great by that hope whose form is madness, great by the love that is hatred to oneself.","A strange thing happened to me in my dream. I was rapt into the Seventh Heaven. There sat all the gods assembled. As a special dispensation I was granted the favor to have one wish. \\"Do you wish for youth,\\" said Mercury, \\"or for beauty, or power, or a long life; or do you wish for the most beautiful woman, or any other of the many fine things we have in our treasure trove? Choose, but only one thing!\\" For a moment I was at a loss. Then I addressed the gods in this wise: \\"Most honorable contemporaries, I choose one thing \u2014 that I may always have the laughs on my side.\\" Not one god made answer, but all began to laugh. From this I concluded that my wish had been granted and thought that the gods knew how to express themselves with good taste: for it would surely have been inappropriate to answer gravely: your wish has been granted.","People understand me so little that they do not even understand when I complain of being misunderstood.","When I was very young and in the cave of Trophonius I forgot to laugh. Then, when I got older, when I opened my eyes and saw the real world, I began to laugh and I haven\u2019t stopped since. I saw that the meaning of life was to get a livelihood, that the goal of life was to be a High Court judge, that the bright joy of love was to marry a well-off girl, that the blessing of friendship was to help each other out of a financial tight spot, that wisdom was what the majority said it was, that passion was to give a speech, that courage was to risk being fined 10 rix-dollars, that cordiality was to say \u2018You\u2019re welcome\u2019 after a meal, and that the fear of God was to go to communion once a year. That\u2019s what I saw. And I laughed.","If you marry, you will regret it; if you do not marry, you will also regret it; if you marry or do not marry, you will regret both; Laugh at the world\u2019s follies, you will regret it, weep over them, you will also regret that; laugh at the world\u2019s follies or weep over them, you will regret both; whether you laugh at the world\u2019s follies or weep over them, you will regret both. Believe a woman, you will regret it, believe her not, you will also regret that; believe a woman or believe her not, you will regret both; whether you believe a woman or believe her not, you will regret both. Hang yourself, you will regret it; do not hang yourself, and you will also regret that; hang yourself or do not hang yourself, you will regret both; whether you hang yourself or do not hang yourself, you will regret both. This, gentlemen, is the sum and substance of all philosophy.","With every increase in the degree of consciousness, and in proportion to that increase, the intensity of despair increases: the more consciousness the more intense the despair","Let other complain that the age is wicked; my complaint is that it is paltry; for it lacks passion. Men\'s thoughts are thin and flimsy like lace, they are themselves pitiable like the lacemakers. The thoughts of their hearts are too paltry to be sinful. For a worm it might be regarded as a sin to harbor such thoughts, but not for a being made in the image of God. Their lusts are dull and sluggish, their passions sleepy...This is the reason my soul always turns back to the Old Testament and to Shakespeare.

I can imagine him able to bring a girl to the point where he was sure she would sacrifice all then he would leave without a word let a lone a declaration a promise.   The unhappy girl would retain the consciousness of it with double bitterness because there was not the slightest thing she could appeal to.

Nothing ever happens but there is immediate publicity everywhere. In the present age a rebellion is, of all things, the most unthinkable. Such an expression of strength would seem ridiculous to the calculating intelligence of our times. On the other hand a political virtuoso might bring off a feat almost as remarkable. He might write a manifesto suggesting a general assembly at which people should decide upon a rebellion, and it would be so carefully worded that even the censor would let it pass. At the meeting itself he would be able to create the impression that his audience had rebelled, after which they would all go quietly home--having spent a very pleasant evening.","He who loved himself became great in himself, and he who loved others became great through his devotion, but he who loved God became greater than all.","A human being is spirit. But what is spirit? Spirit is the self. But what is the self? The self is a relation that relates itself to itself or is the relation\'s relating itself to itself in the relation; the self is not the relation but is the relation\'s relating itself to itself. A human being is a synthesis of the infinite and the finite, of the temporal and the eternal, of freedom and necessity, in short, a synthesis. A synthesis is a relation between two. Considered in this way a human being is still not a self.... In the relation between two, the relation is the third as a negative unity, and the two relate to the relation and in the relation to the relation; thus under the qualification of the psychical the relation between the psychical and the physical is a relation. If, however, the relation relates itself to itself, this relation is the positive third, and this is the self.","\u0634\u0627\u0639\u0631 \u06a9\u06cc\u0633\u062a\u061f \u0627\u0646\u0633\u0627\u0646\u06cc \u0627\u0646\u062f\u0648\u0647\u06af\u06cc\u0646 \u06a9\u0647 \u063a\u0645 \u0698\u0631\u0641\u0634 \u0631\u0627 \u062f\u0631 \u0642\u0644\u0628 \u0646\u0647\u0627\u0646 \u0645\u06cc \u062f\u0627\u0631\u062f\u060c \u0627\u0645\u0627 \u0644\u0628 \u0647\u0627\u06cc\u0634 \u0686\u0646\u0627\u0646 \u062d\u0627\u0644\u062a\u06cc \u06cc\u0627\u0641\u062a\u0647 \u0627\u0646\u062f \u06a9\u0647 \u0648\u0642\u062a\u06cc \u0622\u0647 \u0645\u06cc \u06a9\u0634\u062f \u0648 \u0646\u0627\u0644\u0647 \u0628\u0631 \u0645\u06cc \u0622\u0648\u0631\u062f\u060c \u0627\u0632 \u0628\u06cc\u0646 \u062f\u0648 \u0644\u0628 \u0646\u063a\u0645\u0647 \u0627\u06cc \u062f\u0644\u0646\u0634\u06cc\u0646 \u0628\u0647 \u06af\u0648\u0634 \u0645\u06cc \u0631\u0633\u062f. \u0645\u0631\u062f\u0645\u06cc \u06a9\u0647 \u062f\u0631 \u0627\u0637\u0631\u0627\u0641 \u0627\u0648 \u062c\u0645\u0639 \u0634\u062f\u0647 \u0627\u0646\u062f\u060c \u0645\u06cc \u06af\u0648\u06cc\u0646\u062f: \xab\u0628\u0627\u0632 \u0647\u0645 \u0628\u062e\u0648\u0627\u0646\u060c\xbb \u06a9\u0647 \u0645\u0639\u0646\u0627\u06cc\u0634 \u0622\u0646 \u0627\u0633\u062a \u06a9\u0647: \xab\u0628\u0627\u0634\u062f \u06a9\u0647 \u0628\u0627\u0632 \u062f\u0631\u062f\u0647\u0627 \u0631\u0648\u062d\u062a \u0631\u0627 \u0634\u06a9\u0646\u062c\u0647 \u062f\u0647\u0646\u062f\u060c \u062a\u0627 \u0645\u0627 \u0628\u0627 \u0646\u063a\u0645\u0647 \u06cc \u0646\u0627\u0644\u0647 \u0647\u0627\u06cc\u062a \u0628\u0647 \u0648\u062c\u062f \u0622\u06cc\u06cc\u0645.\xbb","Loving just one is too little; loving all is being superficial; knowing yourself and loving as many as possible, letting your soul hide all the powers of love in itself, so that each gets its particular nourishment while consciousness nevertheless embraces it all \u2013 that is enjoyment, that is living.","Above all, do not loose your desire to walk.

People not only write anonymously, they sign their anonymous works: they even talk anonymously...Nowadays one can talk with any one, and it must be admitted that people\'s opinions are exceedingly sensible, yet the conversation leaves one with the impression of having talked to an anonymity. The same person will say the most contradictory things and, with the utmost calm, make a remark, which coming from him is a bitter satire on his own life. The remark itself may be sensible enough, and of the kind that sounds well at a meeting, and may serve in a discussion preliminary to coming to a decision, in much the same way that paper is made out of rags. But all these opinions put together do not make one human, personal opinion such as you may hear from quite a simple man who talks about very little but really does talk. People\'s remarks are so objective, so all all-inclusive, that it is a matter of complete indifference who expresses them, and where human speech is concerned that is the same as acting \'on principle\'. And so our talk becomes like the public, a pure abstraction. There is no longer any one who knows how to talk, and instead, objective thought produces an atmosphere, an abstract sound, which makes human speech superfluous, just as machinery makes man superfluous. In Germany they even have phrase-books for the use of lovers, and it will end with lovers sitting together talking anonymously. In fact there are hand-books for everything, and very soon education, all the world over, will consist in learning a greater or lesser number of comments by heart, and people will excel according to their capacity for singling out the various facts like a printer singling out the letters, but completely ignorant of the meaning of anything.","I have walked myself into my best thoughts and I know of no thought so burdensome that one cannot walk away from it...but by sitting still, and the more one sits still, the closer one comes to feeling ill.","The greatest danger to Christianity is, I contend, not heresies, heterodoxies, not atheists, not profane secularism \u2013 no, but the kind of orthodoxy which is cordial drivel, mediocrity served up sweet.","That God lets himself be born and becomes a human being, is no idle whim, something that occurs to him so as to have something to do, perhaps to put a stop to the boredom that has brashly been said to be bound up with being God-it is not to have an adventure. No, the fact that God does this is the seriousness of existence. And the seriousness in this seriousness is, in turn, that each shall have an opinion about it.","There is something frightful in the fact that the most dangerous thing of all, playing at Christianity, is never included in the list of heresies and schisms.","Come, sleep and death; you promise nothing, you hold everything.","I choose one thing: always to have the laughter on my side.","I can compel no man to agree with my opinions, but at least I can compel him to have an opinion.","And so when the generation, which itself desired to level and to be emancipated, to destroy authority and at the same time itself, has, through the scepticism of the principle association, started the hopeless forest fire of abstraction; when as a result of levelling with this scepticism, the generation has rid itself of the individual and of everything organic and concrete, and put in its place \'humanity\' and the numerical equality of man and man: when the generation has, for a moment, delighted in this unlimited panorama of abstract infinity, unrelieved by even the smallest eminence, undisturbed by even the slightest interest, a sea of desert; then the time has come for work to begin, for every individual must work for himself, each for himself. No longer can the individual, as in former times, turn to the great for help when he grows confused. That is past; he is either lost in the dizziness of unending abstraction or saved for ever in the reality of religion. Perhaps very many will cry out in despair, but it will not help them--already it is too late...Nor shall any of the unrecognizable presume to help directly or to speak directly or to teach directly at the head of the masses, in order to direct their decisions, instead of giving his negative support and so helping the individual to make the decision which he himself has reached; any other course would be the end of him, because he would be indulging in the short-sighted compassion of man, instead of obeying the order of divinity, of an angry, yet so merciful, divinity. For the development is, in spite of everything, a progress because all the individuals who are saved will receive the specific weight of religion, its essence at first hand, from God himself. Then it will be said: \'behold, all is in readiness, see how the cruelty of abstraction makes the true form of worldliness only too evident, the abyss of eternity opens before you, the sharp scythe of the leveller makes it possible for every one individually to leap over the blade--and behold, it is God who waits. Leap, then, into the arms of God\'. But the \'unrecognizable\' neither can nor dares help man, not even his most faithful disciple, his mother, or the girl for whom he would gladly give his life: they must make the leap themselves, for God\'s love is not a second-hand gift. And yet the \'unrecognizable\' neither can nor dares help man, not even his most faithful disciple, his mother, or the girl for whom he would gladly give his life: they must make the leap themselves, for God\'s love is not a second-hand gift. And yet the \'unrecognizable\' (according to his degree) will have a double work compared with the \'outstanding\' man (of the same degree), because he will not only have to work continuously, but at the same time labour to conceal his work.","The more one suffers, the more, I believe, has one a sense for the comic.","The specific character of despair is precisely this: it is unaware of being despair.","It is a question of discovering a truth which is truth for me, of finding the idea for which I am willing to live and die.","The crowd, in fact, is composed of individuals; it must therefore be in every man\'s power to become what he is, an individual. From becoming an individual no one, no one at all, is excluded, except he who excludes himself by becoming a crowd. To become a crowd, to collect a crowd about one, is on the contrary to affirm the distinctions of human life. The most well-meaning person who talks about these distinctions can easily offend an individual. But then it is not the crowd which possesses power, influence, repute, and mastery over men, but it is the invidious distinctions of human life which despotically ignore the single individual as the weak and impotent, which in a temporal and worldly interest ignore the eternal truth- the single individual.","Faith begins precisely where thinking leaves off","Anxiety can be replaced only by the freedom whose harsh requirements are its cause. Being free requires us to release the brakes that anxiety represents in order to accept and appropriate our proper spiritual fulfillment or perhaps even to recognize, if that is what we in the end believe, that no such prospect is in store.","I have walked myself into my best thoughts and I know of no thought so burdensome that one cannot walk away from it.","The ethical expression for what Abraham did is that he meant to murder Isaac; the religious expression is that he meant to sacrifice Isaac\u2014but precisely in this contradiction is the anxiety that can make a person sleepless, and yet without this anxiety Abraham is not who he is.","He who is educated by anxiety is educated by possibility\u2026 When such a person, therefore, goes out from the school of possibility, and knows more thoroughly than a child knows the alphabet that he demands of life absolutely nothing, and that terror, perdition, annihilation, dwell next door to every man, and has learned the profitable lesson that every dread which alarms may the next instant become a fact, he will then interpret reality differently\u2026","Who tricked me into this whole thing and leaves me standing here? Who am I? How did I get into the world? Why was I not asked about it, why was I not informed of the rules and regulations and just thrust into the ranks as if I had been bought from a peddling shanghaier of human beings? How did I get involved in the big enterprise called actuality? Why should I be involved? Isn\u2019t it a matter of choice? If I am compelled to be involved, where is the manager-I have something to say about this. Is there no manager? To whom shall I make my complaint?","Whatever the one generation may learn from the other, that which is genuinely human no generation learns from the foregoing...Thus no generation has learned from another to love, no generation begins at any other point than at the beginning, no generation has a shorter task assigned to it than had the previous generation.","When you are one of several, then you have lost your freedom; you cannot send for your traveling boots whenever you wish, you cannot move aimlessly about in the world. ~ Either/Or","There is a view of life which conceives that where the crowd is, there is also truth. There is another view of life which conceives that wherever there is a crowd, there is untruth.","The spiritual differs from the religious in being able to endure isolation. The rank of a spiritual person is proportionate to his strength for enduring isolation, whereas we religious people are constantly in need of \u2018the others,\u2019 the herd. We religious folks die, or despair, if we are not reassured by being in the assembly, of the same opinion as the congregation, and so on. But the Christianity of the New Testament is precisely related to the isolation of the spiritual man.","The public is a host, more numerous than all the peoples together, but it is a body which can never be reviewed, it cannot even be represented, because it is an abstraction. Nevertheless, when the age is reflective and passionless and destroys everything concrete, the public becomes everything and is supposed to include everything. And that again shows how the individual is thrown back upon himself.","And to contend with the whole world is a comfort, but to contend with oneself dreadful.","No one may pride himself at being more than an individual, and no one despondently think that he is not an individual...","Do it or don\u2019t do it \u2014 you will regret both.","Now, it is of course well known that Christ continually uses the expression \'imitators.\' He never says that he asks for admirers, adoring admirers, adherents; and when he uses the expression \'follower\' he always explains it in such a way that one perceives that \'imitators\' is meant by it, that is not adherents of a teaching but imitators of a life....","He who first invented the notion of defending Christianity is de facto Judas No. 2; he also betrays with a kiss, only his treachery is that of stupidity.","Man has made a discovery ... the way to make life easy is to make it meaningless.","No one ever comes back from the dead., no one ever enters the world without weeping; no one is ever asked when he wishes to enter life, no one is ever asked when he wishes to leave.","I am poor\u2014you are my riches; dark\u2014you are my light; I own nothing, need nothing. And how could I own anything? After all, it is a contradiction that he can own something who does not own himself. I am happy as a child who is neither able to own anything nor allowed to. I own nothing, for I belong only to you; I am not, I have ceased to be, in order to be yours.\u2014Johannes the Seducer, from_Either/Or_\u201d","What is a poet? A poet is an unhappy being whose heart is torn by secret sufferings, but whose lips are so strangely formed that when the sighs and the cries escape them, they sound like beautiful music\u2026 and men crowd about the poet and say to him: \u201cSing for us soon again; that is as much to say: May new sufferings torment your soul.\u201d","Supliciul disper\u0103rii const\u0103 tocmai \xeen faptul c\u0103 nu po\u0163i muri.

The true knight of faith is a witness, never a teacher, and in this lies the deep humanity in him which is more worth than this foolish concern for others\u2019 weal and woe which is honoured under the name of sympathy, but which is really nothing but vanity.","Philosophy cannot and should not give us an account of faith, but should understand itself and know just what it has indeed to offer, without taking anything away, least of all cheating people out of something by making them think it is nothing.","She was a riddle, who mysteriously possessed her own solution, a secret, and what are all diplomats\' secrets compared with this, an enigma, and what in all the world is so beautiful as the word that solves it?","Now she has power and passion and the struggle has significance for me-let the momentary consequences be what they may.

But I do not have the courage to know anything, nor to possess, to own anything. Most people complain that the world is so prosaic, that life isn\'t like a romantic novel where opportunities are always so favourable. What I complain of is that life is not like a novel where there are hard-hearted fathers, and goblins and trolls to fight with, enchanted princesses to free. What are all such enemies taken together compared to the pallid, bloodless, glutinous nocturnal shapes with which I fight and to which I myself give life and being.","What philosophers say about actuality [Virkelighed] is often just as disappointing as it is when one reads on a sign in a secondhand shop: Pressing Done Here. If a person were to bring his clothes to be pressed, he would be duped, for the sign is merely for sale.","He cannot become old, for he has never been young; he cannot become young, for he has already become old; in a way he cannot die, for he has never lived; in a way he cannot live, for he is already dead.","\u0645\u0627\u0630\u0627 \u0644\u0648 \u0623\u0646 \u0643\u0644 \u0634\u064a\u0621 \u0641\u064a \u0647\u0630\u0627 \u0627\u0644\u0639\u0627\u0644\u0645 \u0647\u0648 \u0639\u0628\u0627\u0631\u0629 \u0639\u0646 \u0633\u0648\u0621 \u0641\u0647\u0645\u061f\u0645\u0627\u0630\u0627 \u0644\u0648 \u0623\u0646 \u0627\u0644\u0636\u062d\u0643 \u0641\u064a \u0627\u0644\u062d\u0642\u064a\u0642\u0629 \u0647\u0648 \u0628\u0643\u0627\u0621\u061f","In fact one is tempted to ask whether there is a single man left ready, for once, to commit an outrageous folly.","No one is any longer carried away by the desire for the good to perform great things, no one is precipitated by evil into atrocious sins, and so there is nothing for either the good or the bad to talk about, and yet for that very reason people gossip all the more, since ambiguity is tremendously stimulating and much more verbose than rejoicing over goodness or repentance over evil.","In order than everything should be reduced to the same level, it is first of all necessary to procure a phantom, its spirit, a monstrous abstraction, an all-embracing something which is nothing, a mirage--and that phantom is the public.","Only the one who descends into the underworld rescues the beloved.","More and more individuals, owing to their bloodless indolence, will aspire to be nothing at all--in order to become the public: that abstract whole formed in the most ludicrous way, by all participants becoming a third party (an onlooker).","Deep within every man there lies the dread of being alone in the world, forgotten by God, overlooked among the household of millions upon millions.","Boredom is the root of all evil. It is very curious that boredom, which itself has such a calm and sedate nature, can have such a capacity to initiate motion. The effect that boredom brings about is absolutely magical, but this effect is one not of attraction but of repulsion.","Spiritual superiority only sees the individual. But alas, ordinarily we human beings are sensual and, therefore, as soon as it is a gathering, the impression changes- we see something abstract, the crowd, and we become different. But in the eyes of God, the infinite spirit, all the millions that have lived and now live do not make a crowd, He only sees each individual.","I am convinced that God is love, this thought has for me a primitive lyrical validity. When it is present to me, I am unspeakably blissful, when it is absent, I long for it more vehemently than does the lover for his object; but I do not believe, this courage I lack. For me the love of God is, both in a direct and in an inverse sense, incommensurable with the whole of reality. I am not cowardly enough to whimper and complain, but neither am I deceitful enough to deny that faith is something much higher. I can well endure living in my way, I am joyful and content, but my joy is not that of faith, and in comparison with that it is unhappy.","On the whole, the longing for solitude is a sign that there still is spirit in a person and is the measure of what spirit there is. [...] In antiquity as well as in the Middle Ages there was an awareness of this longing for solitude and a respect for what it means; whereas in the constant sociality of our day we shrink from solitude to the point (what a capital epigram!) that no use for it is known other than as a punishment for criminals.","\u0644\u0642\u062f \u0643\u062a\u0628\u062a \u0641\u0644\u0633\u0641\u062a\u064a \u0628\u062f\u0645\u064a","Metaphorically speaking, a person\'s ideas must be the building he lives in - otherwise there is something terribly wrong.","- a bad conscience is indeed able to make life interesting.","Anyone not wanting to sink in the wretchedness of the finite is obliged in the most profound sense to struggle with the infinite.","\u062e\u0648\u062f \u0628\u0648\u062f\u0646\u060c \u0645\u0627\u062c\u0631\u0627\u062c\u0648\u06cc\u0627\u0646\u0647 \u0627\u0633\u062a. \u0645\u0627\u0646\u0646\u062f \u062f\u06cc\u06af\u0631\u0627\u0646 \u0628\u0648\u062f\u0646\u060c \u0646\u0633\u062e\u0647 \u06cc \u062a\u0642\u0644\u06cc\u062f\u06cc \u0628\u0648\u062f\u0646\u060c \u062a\u0628\u062f\u06cc\u0644 \u0634\u062f\u0646 \u0628\u0647 \u06cc\u06a9 \u0639\u062f\u062f \u062f\u0631 \u0645\u06cc\u0627\u0646 \u062c\u0645\u0639\u06cc\u062a\u060c \u0628\u0633\u06cc\u0627\u0631 \u0622\u0633\u0627\u0646 \u062a\u0631 \u0648 \u0627\u0645\u0646 \u062a\u0631 \u0627\u0633\u062a.","Ulysses was not comely, but he was eloquent,Yet he fired two goddesses of the sea with love","They were not unfortunate girls who, as outcasts or in the belief that they were cast out by society, grieved wholesomely and intensely and, once in a while at times when the heart was too full, ventilated it in hate or forgiveness. No visible change took place in them; they lived in the accustomed context, were respected as always, and yet they were changed, almost unaccountably to themselves and incomprehensibly to others. Their lives were not cracked or broken, as others\' were, but were bent into themselves; lost to others, they futilely sought to find themselves.","To be isolated is always to assert oneself numerically; when you assert yourself as one, that is isolation.","If we ask what poetry is we may say in general that it is a victory over the world;it is through a negation of the imperfect actuality that poetry opens up a higher actuality","Prayer is listening.","Birka\xe7 a\u011flama n\xf6betinin ard\u0131ndan \u015fimdi \u015fu dingin ruh haliyle ne kadar g\xfczelle\u015fti.

One man is curious about another, every one is undecided, and their way of escape is to say that some one must come who will do something--and then they will bet on him.","How empty life is and without meaning. - We bury a man, we follow him to the grave, we throw three spades of earth on him, we ride out in a coach, we ride home in a coach, we take comfort in the thought that a long life awaits us. But how long is threescore years and ten?

Was it perhaps that you kept it to yourself, like the beloved whose name one still cannot bear the world to mention? For a poet buys this power of words to utter all the grim secrets of others at the cost of a little secret he himself cannot utter.","No one shall be forgotten who was great in this world; but everyone was great in his own way, and everyone in proportion to the greatness of what he loved.","Sitting calmly on a ship in fair weather is not a metaphor for having faith; but when the ship has sprung a leak, then enthusiastically to keep the ship afloat by pumping and not to seek the harbor--that is the metaphor for having faith.

From it I fly down into reality to seize my prey; but i do not remain down there, I bring it home with me, and this prey is a picture I weave into the tapestries of my palace. There I live as one dead. I immerse everything I have experienced in a baptism of forgetfulness unto an eternal remembrance. Everything finite and accidental is forgotten and erased.

The more devotedness one can bring to erotic love, the more interesting. This momentary enjoyment is a rape, even if not outwardly but nevertheless mentally, and in a rape there is only imagined enjoyment; it is like a stolen kiss, something nondescript. No, if one can bring it to a point where a girl has but one task for her freedom, to give herself, so that she feels her whole happiness in this, so that she practically begs for this devotedness and yet is free-only then is there enjoyment, but this always takes a discerning touch","It isn\'t at all difficult for philosophy to begin. Far from it: it begins with nothing and can accordingly always begin. What seems so difficult to philosophy and the philosophers is to stop.","All men have a natural fear of making a mistake--by believing too well of a person. However, the error of believing too ill of a person is perhaps not feared, at least not in the same degree as the other.","Only the lower natures forget themselves and become something new. Thus the butterfly has entirely forgotten that it was a caterpillar, perhaps it may in turn so entirely forget it was a butterfly that is becomes a fish.","To relate oneself expectantly to the possibility of the good is to hope. To relate oneself expectantly to the possibility of evil is to fear. By the decision to choose hope one decides infinitely more than it seems, because it is an eternal decision","These words were spoken by Him to whom, according to His own statement, is given all power in heaven and on earth. You who hear me must consider within yourselves whether you will bow before his authority or not, accept and believe the words or not. But if you do not wish to do so, then for heaven\'s sake do not go and accept the words because they are clever or profound or wonderfully beautiful, for that is a mockery of God.","The humorous self-sufficiency of genius is the unity of a modest resignation in the world and a proud elevation above the world: of being an unnecessary superfluity and a precious ornament. If the genius is an artist, then he accomplishes his work of art, but neither he nor his work of art has a telos outside him. Or he is an author, who abolishes every teleological relation to his environment and humorously defines himself as a poet. Lyrical art has certainly no telos outside it: and whether a man writes a short lyric or folios, it makes no difference to the quality of the nature of his work. The lyrical author is only concerned with his production, enjoys the pleasure of producing, often perhaps only after pain and effort; but he has nothing to do with others, he does not write in order that: in order to enlighten men or in order to help them along the right road, in order to bring about something; in short, he does not write in order that. The same is true of every genius. No genius has an in order that; the Apostle has absolutely and paradoxically, an in order that.","In eternity it will be asked whether you may not have damaged a good thing, in order that you also might judge with them that did not know how to judge, but who possessed the crowd\'s strength, which in the temporal sense is significant, but to which eternity is wholly indifferent.","The biggest danger, that of losing oneself, can pass off in the world as quietly as if it were nothing; every other loss, an arm, a leg, five dollars, a wife, etc. is bound to be noticed.","Boredom is the only continuity the ironist has.","The misfortune of our time is just this, that it has become simply nothing else but \'time\', the temporal, which is impatient of hearing anything about eternity.","Man is the synthesis of the infinite and the finite, the temporal and the eternal, of freedom and necessity, in short it is a synthesis. A synthesis is a relation between two factors. So regarded, man is not yet a self.","By seeing the multitude of people around it, by being busied with all sorts of worldly affairs, by being wise to the ways of the world, such a person forgets himself, in a divine sense forgets his own name, dares not believe in himself, finds being himself too risky, finds it much easier and safer to be like the others, to become a copy, a number, along with the crowd. Now this form of despair goes practically unnoticed in the world. Precisely by losing oneself in this way, such a person gains all that is required for a flawless performance in everyday life, yes, for making a great success out of life. Here there is no dragging of the feet, no difficulty with his self and its infinitizing, he is ground smooth as a pebble, as exchangeable as a coin of the realm.

This sectarianism is an attempt to leap away from the narrow path of the paradox and become a tragic hero at a cheap price. The tragic hero expresses the universal and sacrifices himself for it. The sectarian punchinello, instead of that, has a private theatre, i.e. several good friends and comrades who represent the universal just about as well as the beadles in The Golden Snuffbox represent justice. The knight of faith, on the contrary, is the paradox, is the individual, absolutely nothing but the individual, without connections or pretensions. This is the terrible thing which the sectarian manikin cannot endure. For instead of learning from this terror that he is not capable of performing the great deed and then plainly admitting it (an act which I cannot but approve, because it is what I do) the manikin thinks that by uniting with several other manikins he will be able to do it.

The ressentiment which results from want of character can never understand that eminent distinction really is distinction. Neither does it understand itself by recognizing distinction negatively (as in the case of ostracism) but wants to drag it down, wants to belittle it so that it really ceases to be distinguished. And ressentiment not only defends itself against all existing forms of distinction but against that which is still to come.The ressentiment which is establishing itself is the process of levelling.","Reflection is and remains the hardest creditor in existence; hitherto it has cunningly bought up all the possible views of life, but it cannot buy the essentially religious and eternal view of life.","What is decisive is that with God everything is possible. . .

Then the question is whether he will believe that for God everything is possible...","What we call worldliness simply consists of such people who, if one may so express it, pawn themselves to the world.","The reward of the good man is to be allowed to worship in truth.","How to be listed as a dream in the mind of a young girl is an art, going out is a masterpiece.","It is now my intention to draw out from the story of Abraham the dialecticalconsequences inherent in it, expressing them in the form ofproblemata, in order to seewhat a tremendous paradox faith is, a paradox which is capable of transforming amurder into a holy act well-pleasing to God, a paradox which gives Isaac back toAbraham, which no thought can master, because faith begins precisely there wherethinking leaves off.","The genius differs from us men in being able to endure isolation, his rank as a genius is proportionate to his strength for enduring isolation, whereas we men are constantly in need of \\"the others,\\" the herd; we die, or despair, if we are not reassured by being in the herd, of the same opinion as the herd.","As the calm lake stems from the deep spring that no eye saw, so too a person\'s love has a still deeper ground, in God\'s love. If there were no gushing spring at the bottom, if Hod were not love, then neither would there be the little lake nor either a person\'s love. As the calm lake stems darkly from the deep spring, so a person\'s love originate mysteriously in God\'s. As the calm lake indeed invites you to contemplate it, yet with the darkness of the reflection prevents you from seeing through it, so does love\'s mysterious origin in God\'s love prevent you from seeing its ground. When you think you see it, it is a reflection that deceives you, as if what only hides the deeper ground were itself the ground.","To stand on one leg and prove God\'s existence is a very different thing from going on one\'s knees and thanking Him.","The more consciousness there is in such a sufferer who in despair wills to be himself, the more his despair intensifies and becomes demonic. It usually originates as follows. A self that in despair wills to be itself is pained in some distress or other that does not allow itself to be taken away from or separated from his concrete self. So now he makes precisely this torment the object of all his passion, and finally it becomes a demonic rage. By now, even if God in heaven and all the angels offered to help him out of it- no, he does not want that, now it is too late. Once he would gladly have given everything to be rid of this agony, but he was kept waiting; now it is too late, now he would rather rage against everything and be the wronged victim of the whole world and of all life, and it is of particular significance to him to make sure that he has his torment on hand and that no one takes it away from him- for then he would not be able to demonstrate and prove to himself that he is right. This eventually becomes such a fixation that for an extremely strange reason he is afraid of eternity, afraid that it will separate him from his, demonically understood, infinite superiority over other men, his justification, demonically understood, for being what he is.","one cannot seek for what he knows, and it seems equally impossible for him to seek for what he does not know.

Seseorang yang tidak bahagia yang menyembunyikan kesedihan yang sangat mendalam di dalam hatinya, tapi bibirnya berbentuk sedemikian rupa, sehingga desakan dan tangisan yang melaluinya terdengar seperti musik yang indah.","she does not suspect how much reason I have for deprecating all sympathy.","An increased power of reflection like an increased knowledge only adds to man\'s affliction, and above all it is certain that for the individual as for the generation no task is more difficult than to escape from the temptations of reflection, simply because they are so dialectical and the result of one clever discovery may give the whole question a new turn, because at any moment reflection is capable of explaining everything quite differently and allowing one some way of escape; because at the last moment of a reflective decision reflection is capable of changing everything--after one has made far greater exertions than are necessary to get a man of character into the midst of things.","Were I to wish for anything I would not wish for wealth and power, but for the passion of the possible, that eye which everywhere, ever young, ever burning, sees possibility. Pleasure disappoints, not possibility.","There are many people who reach their conclusions about life like schoolboys; they cheat their master by copying the answer out of a book without having worked out the sum for themselves.","Not merely in the realm of commerce but in the world of ideas as well our age is organizing a regular clearance sale. Everything is to be had at such a bargain that it is questionable whether in the end there is anybody who will want to bid.","The dialectic of antiquity tended towards leadership (the great individual and the masses--the free man and the slaves); so far the dialectic of Christendom tends towards representation (the majority sees itself in its representative and is set free by the consciousness that it is the majority which is represented, in a sort of self-consciousness); the dialectic of the present age tends towards equality, and its most logical--though mistaken--fulfilment is levelling, as the negative unity of the negative reciprocity of all individuals.","Spiritually, a man\'s thoughts must be the building in which he lives, otherwise it\'s wrong.","But the present generation, wearied by its chimerical efforts, relapses into complete indolence. Its condition is that of a man who has only fallen asleep towards morning: first of all come great dreams, then a feeling of laziness, and finally a witty or clever excuse for remaining in bed.","The tedium vitae so constant in antiquity was due to the fact that the outstanding individual was what others could not be; the inspiration of modern times will be that any man who finds himself, religiously speaking, has only achieved what every one can achieve.","What is reasoning? It is the result of doing away with the vital distinction which separates subjectivity and objectivity. As a form of abstract thought reasoning is not profoundly dialectical enough; as an opinion and a conviction it lacks full-blooded individuality. But where mere scope is concerned, reasoning has all the apparent advantage; for a thinker can encompass his science, a man can have an opinion upon a particular subject and a conviction as a result of a certain view of life, but one can reason about anything.","A crowd in its very concept is the untruth, by reason of the fact that it renders the individual completely impenitent and irresponsible, or at least weakens his sense of responsibility by reducing it to a fraction.","What I complain of is that life is not like a novel where there are hard-hearted fathers, and goblins and trolls to fight with, enchanted princesses to free. What are all such enemies taken together compared to the pallid, bloodless, glutinous nocturnal shapes with which I fight and to which I myself give life and being.","I might be tempted to make to Christendom a proposal different from that of the Bible society. Let us collect all the New Testaments we have, let us bring them out to an open square or up to the summit of a mountain, and while we all kneel let one man speak to God thus: \'Take this book back again; we men, such as we now are, are not fit to go in for this sort of thing, it only makes us unhappy,\' This is my proposal, that like those inhabitants in Gerasa we beseech Christ to depart from our borders. This would be an honest and human way of talking -- rather different from the disgusting hypocritical priestly fudge...","But the eternal is not a thing which can be had regardless of the way in which it is acquired; no, the eternal is not really a thing, but is the way in which it is acquired.","It is unbelievable what a person of prayer can achieve if he would but close the doors behind him.","What is a poet ? An unhappy person who conceals profound anguish in his heart but whose lips are so formed that as sighs and cries pass over them they sound like beautiful music\u2026And people crowd around the poet and say to him, \u201cSing again soon\u2014in other words, may new sufferings torture your soul, and may your lips continue to be formed as before, because your screams would only alarm us, but the music is charming.\u201d","How dreadful boredom is \u2014 how dreadfully boring; I know no stronger expression, no truer one, for like is recognized only by like\u2026 I lie prostrate, inert; the only thing I see is emptiness, the only thing I live on is emptiness, the only thing I move in is emptiness. I do not even suffer pain\u2026 Pain itself has lost its refreshment for me. If I were offered all the glories of the world or all the torments of the world, one would move me no more than the other; I would not turn over to the other side either to attain or to avoid. I am dying death. And what could divert me? Well, if I managed to see a faithfulness that withstood every ordeal, an enthusiasm that endured everything, a faith that moved mountains; if I were to become aware of an idea that joined the finite and the infinite.","If anyone thinks he has faith and yet is indifferent towards this possession, is neither cold nor hot, he can be certain that he does not have faith. If anyone thinks he is Christian and yet is indifferent towards his being a Christian, then he really is not one at all. What would we think of a man who affirmed that he was in love and also that it was a matter of indifference to him?","Oh Thou that givest both the beginning and the completion, give Thou victory in the day of need so that what neither a man\'s burning wish nor his determined resolution may attain to, may be granted unto him in the sorrowing of repentance: to will only one thing.","There is nothing so seductive to a girl as to be loved by a poetic-depressive type. And if she is vain enough to deceive herself into thinking that she loves him faithfully by clinging to him instead of giving him up, then her task will be easy. She will enjoy both the distinction and the good conscience of being faithful, and at the same time the most finely distilled romantic love. God save everyone from such faithfulness!","In association with the ordinary run of men I have had but little to win or to lose ... My companions have with few exceptions exerted no marked influence on me ... So I am standing once more at the point where I must begin in another way. I shall now try to look calmly at myself and begin to act inwardly; for only in this way will I be able ... to call myself \'I\' in a profounder sense ... So let the die be cast - I am crossing the Rubicon. This road no doubt leads me into battle, but I will not give up.","The person whose joy is dependant upon certain conditions is not himself joyful; his joy, after all, is that of the conditions and is conditional upon them.","Besides, Christianity is not a doctrine to be taught, but rather a life to be lived.","If the ethical - that is, social morality - is the highest and if there is in a person no residual incommensurability in some way such that this incommensurability is not evil then no categories are needed other than what Greek philosophy had... and what their wisdom amounts to is the beautiful proposition that basically everything is the same.","It is a positive starting point for philosophy when Aristotle says that philosophy begins with wonder, not as in our day with doubt. Moreover the world will learn that the thing is not to begin with the negative, and the reason why it has succeeded up to the present is that it has never really given itself over to the negative, and so has never seriously done what it said. Its doubt is mere child\'s play.","\u0645\u0627\u0630\u0627 \u0644\u0648 \u0623\u0646 \u0643\u0644 \u0634\u064a\u0626 \u0641\u064a \u0647\u0630\u0627 \u0627\u0644\u0639\u0627\u0644\u0645 \u0647\u0648 \u0639\u0628\u0627\u0631\u0629 \u0639\u0646 \u0633\u0648\u0621 \u0641\u0647\u0645\u061f \u0645\u0627\u0630\u0627 \u0644\u0648 \u0623\u0646 \u0627\u0644\u0636\u062d\u0643 \u0641\u064a \u0627\u0644\u062d\u0642\u064a\u0642\u0629 \u0647\u0648 \u0639\u0628\u0627\u0631\u0629 \u0639\u0646 \u0628\u0643\u0627\u0621","The Good is one thing; the reward is something else. To will the Good for the sake of reward is not to will one thing but two. If a man loves a woman for the sake of her wealth, who will call him a lover? To will the Good for the sake of reward is hypocrisy \u2013 sheer duplicity!","Imagination is what providence uses to take men captive in actuality, in existence, in order to get them far enough out, or within, or down into existence. And when imagination has helped them get as far out as they should be - then actuality genuinely begins.","Ask me what you wish; just do not ask me for reasons.","What every man can do is to make the movement of infinite resignation, and I for my part would not hesitate to pronounce everyone cowardly who wishes to make himself believe he can not do it. With faith it is a different matter. But what every man has not a right to do, is to make others believe that faith is something lowly, or that it is an easy thing, whereas it is the greatest and the hardest. People","What am I? The modest narrator who accompanies your triumphs; the dancer who supports you when you rise in your lovely grace; the branch upon which you rest a moment when you are tired of flying; the bass that interposes itself below the soprano\u2019s fervour to let it climb even higher\u2014what am I? I am the earthly gravity that keeps you on the ground. What am I, then? Body, mass, earth, dust and ashes.\u2014You, my Cordelia, you are soul and spirit. \u2014Johannes the Seducer, from_Either/Or_\u201d","Anxiety is freedom\u2019s possibility; this anxiety alone is, through faith, absolutely formative, since it consumes all finite ends, discovers all their deceptions.","Something wonderful has happened to me. I was carried up into the seventh heaven. There all the gods sat assembled. By special grace I was granted the favor of a wish. \\"Will you,\\" said Mercury, \\"have youth, or beauty, or power, or a long life, or the most beautiful maiden, or any of the other glories we have in the chest? Choose, but only one thing.\\" For a moment I was at a loss. Then I addressed myself to the gods as follows: \\"Most honorable contemporaries, I choose this one thing, that I may always have the laugh on my side.\\" Not one of the gods said a word, on the contrary, they all began to laugh. Hence, I concluded that my request was granted, and found that the gods knew how to express themselves with great taste; for it would hardly have been suitable for them to answer gravely: \\"It is granted thee.","My love consumes me. Only my voice is left, a voice which has fallen in love with you whispers to you everywhere that I love you. Oh! Does it weary you to hear this voice? Everywhere it enfolds you; like an inexhaustible, shifting surround, I place my transparently reflected soul about your pure, deep being. \u2014Johannes the Seducer, from_Either/Or_\u201d","Courage is life\'s only measure.","The girl made an impression on me, and I forgot her; the other made no impression, and her I can remember.","For the universal will constantly torture him and say, \'You ought to have talked. Where will you find the certainty that it was not after all a hidden pride which governed your resolution?","The whole world can be divided into those who write and those who do not write. Those who write represent despair, and those who read disapprove of it and believe that they have a superior wisdom \u2013 and yet, if they were able to write, they would write the same thing. Basically they are all equally despairing, but when one does not have the opportunity to become important with his despair, then it is hardly worth the trouble to despair and show it. Is this what it is to have conquered despair?","All distinctions between the many different kinds of love are essentially abolished by Christianity.","So now begins the first war with Cordelia\' in which I retreat and thereby teach her to be victorious as she pursues me. I continually fall back, and in this backward movement I teach her to know through me all the powers of erotic love, its turbulent thoughts\' its passion, what longing is, and hope, and impatient expectancy. As I perform this set of steps before her\' all this will correspondingly in her\' It is a triumphant procession in which I am leading her, and I myself am just as much the one who dithyrambically sings praises to her victory as I am the one who shows the way. She will gain courage to believe in erotic love, to believe it is an etemal force, when she sees its dominion over me, sees my movements. She will believe me, partly because I rely on my artistry, and partly because at the bottom of what I am doing there is truth. If that were not the case, she would not believe me. With my every move, she becomes stronger and stronger; love is awakening in her soul; she is being enthroned in her meaning as a woman","The highest and most beautiful things in life are not to be heard, nor read about, nor seen, but, if one will, are to be lived.","As the ironist does not have the new within his power, it might be asked how he destroys the old, and to this it must be answered: he destroys the given actuality by the given actuality itself.","A young girl is excused for not being able to give reasons, they say she lives in her feelings. It is different with me. Generally, I have so many and usually mutually contradictory reasons that, for that reason, it is impossible for me to give reasons.","So it isn\'t I who am master of my life, I am just one of the threads to be woven into life\'s calico!

Then I sit thoughtful like an old man, grey-headed, and in a low voice, almost a whisper, explain the pictures; and by my side a child sits and listens, even though he remembers everything before I tell it.","\u064a\u0642\u0648\u0644 \u0645\u062b\u0644 \u0642\u062f\u064a\u0645 \u0645\u0623\u062e\u0648\u0630 \u0645\u0646 \u0627\u0644\u0639\u0627\u0644\u0645 \u0627\u0644\u062e\u0627\u0631\u062c\u064a \u0627\u0644\u0645\u0631\u0626\u064a \\"\u0644\u0646 \u064a\u0646\u0627\u0644 \u0627\u0644\u062e\u0628\u0632 \u0625\u0644\u0627 \u0627\u0644\u0631\u062c\u0644 \u0627\u0644\u0643\u0627\u062f\u062d\\" \u0648\u0627\u0644\u063a\u0631\u064a\u0628 \u0623\u0646 \u0647\u0630\u0627 \u0627\u0644\u0645\u062b\u0644 \u0644\u0627 \u064a\u0646\u0637\u0628\u0642 \u0628\u0635\u062f\u0642 \u0641\u064a \u0630\u0644\u0643 \u0627\u0644\u0639\u0627\u0644\u0645 \u0627\u0644\u0630\u064a \u064a\u0646\u062a\u0645\u064a \u0625\u0644\u064a\u0647 \u0628\u062c\u0644\u0627\u0621 \u0630\u0644\u0643 \u0623\u0646 \u0639\u0627\u0644\u0645 \u0627\u0644\u0638\u0627\u0647\u0631 \u062e\u0627\u0636\u0639 \u0644\u0642\u0627\u0646\u0648\u0646 \u0627\u0644\u0646\u0642\u0635-\u0648\u0641\u064a\u0647 \u062a\u062a\u0643\u0631\u0631 \u062d\u064a\u0646\u0627\u064b \u0628\u0639\u062f \u0622\u062e\u0631 \u062a\u0644\u0643 \u0627\u0644\u062a\u062c\u0631\u0628\u0629 \u0627\u0644\u062a\u064a \u0646\u0631\u0649 \u0641\u064a\u0647\u0627 \u0623\u0646 \u0645\u0646 \u0644\u0627 \u064a\u0639\u0645\u0644 \u064a\u062d\u0635\u0644 \u0623\u064a\u0636\u0627\u064b \u0639\u0644\u0649 \u0627\u0644\u062e\u0628\u0632-\u0628\u0644 \u0625\u0646 \u0645\u0646 \u064a\u0646\u0627\u0645 \u064a\u062d\u0635\u0644 \u0639\u0644\u064a\u0647 \u0628\u0648\u0641\u0631\u0629 \u0623\u0643\u062b\u0631 \u0645\u0646 \u0627\u0644\u0631\u062c\u0644 \u0627\u0644\u0643\u0627\u062f\u062d\u060c\u0641\u0647\u0630\u0627 \u0627\u0644\u0639\u0627\u0644\u0645 \u0627\u0633\u064a\u0631 \u0644\u0642\u0627\u0646\u0648\u0646 \u0639\u062f\u0645 \u0627\u0644\u0627\u0643\u062a\u0631\u0627\u062b(\u0623\u0648 \u0642\u0627\u0646\u0648\u0646 \u0627\u0633\u062a\u0648\u0627\u0621 \u0627\u0644\u0637\u0631\u0641\u064a\u0646)-\u0623\u0645\u0627 \u0641\u064a \u0639\u0627\u0644\u0645 \u0627\u0644\u0631\u0648\u062d \u0641\u0627\u0644\u0623\u0645\u0631 \u062c\u062f \u0645\u062e\u062a\u0644\u0641-\u0641\u0647\u0646\u0627 \u064a\u0633\u0648\u062f \u0627\u0644\u0646\u0638\u0627\u0645 \u0627\u0644\u0625\u0644\u0647\u064a \u0627\u0644\u0623\u0628\u062f\u064a-\u0648\u0647\u0646\u0627 \u0644\u0627 \u062a\u0645\u0637\u0631 \u0627\u0644\u0633\u0645\u0627\u0621 \u0639\u0644\u0649 \u0627\u0644\u0639\u0627\u062f\u0644 \u0648\u0627\u0644\u0638\u0627\u0644\u0645 \u0633\u0648\u0627\u0621-\u0648\u0647\u0646\u0627 \u0644\u0627 \u062a\u0634\u0631\u0642 \u0627\u0644\u0634\u0645\u0633 \u0639\u0644\u0649 \u0627\u0644\u0637\u064a\u0628 \u0648\u0627\u0644\u0634\u0631\u064a\u0631 \u0645\u0639\u0627\u064b-\u0648\u0647\u0646\u0627 \u064a\u0646\u0637\u0628\u0642 \u0630\u0644\u0643 \u0627\u0644\u0645\u062b\u0644-\u0645\u0646 \u064a\u0639\u0645\u0644 \u0647\u0648 \u0648\u062d\u062f\u0647 \u0627\u0644\u0630\u064a \u064a\u062d\u0635\u0644 \u0639\u0644\u0649 \u0627\u0644\u062e\u0628\u0632-\u0648\u0645\u0646 \u0644\u0627 \u064a\u0639\u0645\u0644 \u0644\u0627 \u064a\u062d\u0635\u0644 \u0639\u0644\u0649 \u0627\u0644\u062e\u0628\u0632 \u0628\u0644 \u064a\u0628\u0642\u0649 \u0645\u062e\u062f\u0648\u0639\u0627\u064b-\u0648\u0623\u0646 \u0645\u0646 \u064a\u062d\u064a\u0627 \u0641\u064a \u0627\u0644\u0642\u0644\u0642 \u0648\u062d\u062f\u0647 \u0627\u0644\u0630\u064a \u064a\u062c\u062f \u0627\u0644\u0631\u0627\u062d\u0629-\u0648\u0623\u0646 \u0645\u0646 \u064a\u0634\u0647\u0631 \u0627\u0644\u0633\u0643\u064a\u0646 \u0647\u0648 \u0648\u062d\u062f\u0647 \u0627\u0644\u0630\u064a \u064a\u0646\u0642\u0630 \u0627\u0633\u062d\u0642","Pe peretele opus se afl\u0103 o oglind\u0103; ea nu se sinchise\u015fte de aceast\u0103 oglind\u0103, \xeen schimb oglinda se sinchise\u015fte de ea.

His head is heavy, his knees are weak, yet he rests on none but himself. He is faint, yet how powerful!

On the other hand almost any theological student is capable of something far more wonderful. He could found a society with the sole object of saving all those who are lost. The age of great and good actions is past, the present is the age of anticipation when even recognition is received in advance.","For it is great to give up one\'s wish, but it is greater to hold it fast after having given it up, it is great to grasp the eternal, but it is greater to hold fast to the temporal after having given it up.","Ceea ce \xeemi lipse\u015fte de fapt e s\u0103 \xeemi l\u0103muresc mie \xeensumi ce trebuie s\u0103 fac, nu ce trebuie s\u0103 cunosc, dec\xe2t \xeen m\u0103sura \xeen care cunoa\u015fterea precede \xeen mod necesar orice act.

That is the idea of religion. But, under those conditions, the equalitarian order is severe and the profit is seemingly very small; seemingly, for unless the individual learns in the reality of religion and before God to be content with himself, and learns, instead of dominating others, to dominate himself, content as priest to be his own audience, and as author his own reader, if he will not learn to be satisfied with that as the highest, because it is the expression of the equality of all men before God and of our likeness to others, then he will not escape from reflection.","But Abraham believed, therefore he was young; for he who always hopes for the best becomes old, and he who is always prepared for the worst grows old early, but he who believes preserves an eternal youth.","But it was not to remain thus. Still once more Abraham was to be tried. He had fought with that cunning power which invents everything, with that alert enemy which never slumbers, with that old man who outlives all things\u2013he had fought with Time and preserved his faith. Now all the terror of the strife was concentrated in one instant.","If Hegel had written the whole of his logic and then said, in the preface or some other place, that it was merely an experiment in thought in which he had even begged the question in many places, then he would certainly have been the greatest thinker who had ever lived. As it is, he is merely comic.","Yet Abraham believed, and believed for this life. Yea, if his faith had been only for a future life, he surely would have cast everything away in order to hasten out of this world to which he did not belong. But Abraham\'s faith was not of this sort, if there be such a faith; for really this is not faith but the furthest possibility of faith which has a presentiment of its object at the extremest limit of the horizon, yet is separated from it by a yawning abyss within which despair carries on its game. But Abraham believed precisely for this life, that he was to grow old in the land, honored by the people, blessed in his generation, remembered forever in Isaac, his dearest thing in life, whom he embraced with a love for which it would be a poor expression to say that he loyally fulfilled the father\'s duty of loving the son, as indeed is evinced in the words of the summons, \\"the son whom thou lovest.","If a man had a little button sewn on the inner pocket of his coat \'on principle\' his otherwise unimportant and quite serviceable action would become charged with importance--it is not improbable that it would result in the formation of a society.","On principle\' a man can do anything, take part in anything and himself remain inhuman and indeterminate. \'On principle\' a man may interest himself in the founding of a brothel, and the same man can \'on principle\' assist in the publication of a new Hymn book because it is supposed to be the great need of the times. But it would be as unjustifiable to conclude from the first fact that he was debauched as it would, perhaps, be to conclude from the second that he read or sang hymns.","Job endured everything \u2014 until his friends came to comfort him, then he grew impatient.","As a genius St. Paul cannot be compared with either Plato or Shakespeare, as a coiner of beautiful similes he comes pretty low down in the scale, as a stylist his name is quite obscure--and as an upholsterer: well, I frankly admit I have no idea how to place him.","An Apostle can never come to himself in such a way that he becomes conscious of his apostolic calling as a factor in the development of his life. Apostolic calling is a paradoxical factor, which from first to last in his life stands paradoxically outside his personal identity with himself as the definite person he is.","To ask whether Christ is profound is blasphemy, and is an attempt (whether conscious or not) to destroy Him surreptitiously; for the question conceals a doubt concerning His authority, and this attempt to weigh Him up is impertinent in its directness, behaving as though He were being examined, instead of which it is to Him that all power is given in heaven and upon earth.","A \u201cno does not hide anything, but a yes can very easily become a deception, a self-deception; which of all difficulties is the most difficult to conquer. Ah, it is all tootrue that, \u201cThe road to hell is paved with good intentions.\u201d","I shall be as willing as the next man to fall down in worship before the System, if only I can manage to set eyes on it. Hitherto I have had no success; and though I have young legs, I am almost weary from running back and forth... Once or twice I have been on the verge of bending the knee. But at the last moment, when I already had my handkerchief spread on the ground, to avoid soiling my trousers, and I made a trusting appeal to one of the initiated who stood by: \\"Tell me now sincerely, is it entirely finished; for if so I will kneel down before it, even at the risk of ruining a pair of trousers (for on account of the heavy traffic to and from the system, the road has become quite muddy),\\" - I always receive the same answer: \\"No, it is not yet quite finished.\\" And so there was another postponement - of the system, and of my homage. System and finality are pretty much one and the same, so much so that if the system is not finished, there is no system.","He had thought that to pray was to talk; he learned that to pray is not only to keep silent, but to listen. And that is how it is: to pray is not to listen to oneself speak, but is to come to keep silent, and to continue keeping silent, to wait, until the person who prays hears God.","If this had not been the case with Abraham, then perhaps he might have loved God but notbelieved; for he who loves God without faith reflects upon himself, he who loves God believingly reflects upon God.","An illusion can never be destroyed directly, and only by indirect means can it be radically removed... That is, one must approach from behind the person who is under an illusion.","The merman does not want to seduce Agnes, although previously he had seduced many. He is no longer a merman, or, if one so will, he is a miserable merman who already has long been sitting on the floor of the sea and sorrowing. However, he knows (as the legend in fact teaches), that he can be delivered by the love of an innocent girl. But he has a bad conscience with respect to girls and does not dare to approach them. Then he sees Agnes. Already many a time when he was hidden in the reeds he had seen her walking on the shore. Her beauty, her quiet occupation with herself, fixes his attention upon her ; but only sadness prevails in his soul, no wild desire stirs in it. And so when the merman mingles his sighs with the soughing of the reeds she turns her ear thither, and then stands still and falls to dreaming, more charming than any woman and yet beautiful as a liberating angel which inspires the merman with confidence. The merman plucks up courage, he approaches Agnes, he wins her love, he hopes for his deliverance. But Agnes was no quiet maiden, she was fond of the roar of the sea, and the sad sighing beside the inland lake pleased her only because then she seethed more strongly within. She would be off and away, she would rush wildly out into the infinite with the merman whom she loved \u2013 so she incites the memman. She disdained his humility, now pride awakens. And the sea roars and the waves foam and the merman embraces Agnes and plunges with her into the deep. Never had he been so wild, never so full of desire, for he had hoped by this girl to find deliverance. He soon became tired of Agnes, yet no one ever found her corpse, for she became a mermaid who tempted men by her songs.","Thus when the ambitious man, whose slogan was \\"Either Caesar or nothing\\", does not become Caesar, he is in despair over it. But this signifies something else, namely, that precisely because he did not become Caesar he now cannot bear to be himself. Consequently he is not in despair over the fact that he did not become Caesar, but he is in despair over himself for the fact that he did not become Caesar.","He follows his heart\'s desire, but having found what he sought he wanders round to everyone\'s door with his song and speech, so that all can admire the hero as he does, be proud of the hero as he is.","Satan\'s despair is absolute because Satan, as pure spirit, is pure consciousness, and for Satan (and all men in his predicament) every increase in consciousness is an increase in despair.","I don\'t feel like doing anything. I don\'t feel like riding the motion is too powerful; I don\'t feel like walking-it is too tiring; I don\'t feel like lying down, for either I would have to stay down, and I don\'t feel like doing that, or I would have to get up again, and I don\'t feel like doing that, either. Summa Summarum: I don\'t feel like doing anything.","My depression is the most faithful mistress I have known -- no wonder, then, that I return the love.","I lack altogether patience to live. I cannot see the grass grow, but since I cannot I don\u2019t feel at all inclined to. My views are the fleeting observations of a \u2018travelling scholar\u20199 rushing through life in the greatest haste. People say the good Lord fills the stomach before the eyes. I haven\u2019t noticed; my eyes have had enough and I am weary of everything, and yet I hunger.","The present state of the world and the whole of life is diseased. If I were a doctor and were asked for my advice, I would reply: Create silence! The Word of God cannot be heard in the noisy world of today. And even if it were blazoned forth with all the panoply of noise so that it could be heard in the midst of all the other noise, then it would no longer be the Word of God.

However much heartache it has, it keeps silent. It does not complain; it accuses no one; it sighs only to fall silent again. The bird is not free from suffering, but the silent bird frees itself from what makes the suffering more burdensome: from the misunderstood sympathy of others; frees itself from what makes the suffering last longer: from all the talk of suffering; frees itself from what makes the suffering into something worse than suffering: from the sin of impatience and sadness.","Battle day and night against the guile of oblivion...","Precisely because a human being has the ability to speak, for this very reason the ability to keep silent is an art; and precisely because this advantage of his tempts him so easily, the ability to keep silent is a great art.","The bird keeps silent and waits: it knows, or rather it fully and firmly believes, that everything takes place at its appointed time. Therefore the bird waits, but it knows that it is not granted to it to know the hour or the day; therefore it keeps silent. Then, when the moment comes, the silent bird understands that this is the moment; it makes use of it and is never put to shame.","At vove er at miste fodf\xe6stet et kort \xf8jeblik - ikke at vove er at miste sig selv.","A man\u2019s life is wasted when he lives on, so deceived by the joys of life or by its sorrows, that he never becomes decisively conscious of himself as spirit, as self, that is, he never is aware in the deepest sense that there is a God.","Personally, I do not lack the courage to think a thought whole.","Whatever can be the meaning of this life? If we divide mankind into two large classes, we can say that one works for a living, the other has no need to. But working for one\u2019s living can\u2019t be the meaning of life; to suppose that constantly procuring the conditions of life should be the answer to the question of the meaning of what they make possible is a contradiction. Usually the lives of the other class have no meaning either, beyond that of consuming the said conditions. To say that","And although this (marital love) cannot be portrayed artistically, then let your consolation be, as it is mine, that we are not to read about or listen to or look at what is highest and the most beautiful in life, but are, if you please, to live it. Therefore, when I readily admit that romantic love lends itself much better to artistic portrayal than marital love, this does not at all mean that it is less esthetic than the other - on the contrary, it is more esthetic.","M\xfckemmel a\u015fk, insan\u0131n kendisini mutsuz edecek ki\u015fiyi sevmesidir.","Love has many positionings. Cordelia makes good progress. She is sitting on my lap, her arm twines, soft and warm, round my neck; she leans upon my breast, light, without gravity; the soft contours scarcely touch me; like a flower her lovely figure twines about me, freely as a ribbon. Her eyes are hidden beneath her lashes, her bosom is dazzling white like snow, so smooth that my eye cannot rest, it would glance off if her bosom were not moving. What does this movement mean? Is it love? Perhaps. It is a presentiment of it, its dream. It still lacks energy. Her embrace is comprehensive, as the cloud enfolding the transfigured one, detached as a breeze, soft as the fondling of a flower; she kisses me unspecifically, as the sky kisses the sea, gently and quietly, as the dew kisses a flower, solemnly as the sea kisses the image of the moon. I would call her passion at this moment a naive passion. When the change has been made and I begin to draw back in earnest, she will call on everything she has to captivate me. She has no other means for this purpose than the erotic itself, except that this will now appear on a quite different scale. It then becomes a weapon in her hand which she wields against me. I then have the reflected passion. She fights for her own sake because she knows I possess the erotic; she fights for her own sake so as to overcome me. She herself is in need of a higher form of the erotic. What I taught her to suspect by arousing her, my coldness now teaches her to understand but in such a way that she thinks it is she herself who discovers it. So she wants to take me by surprise; she wants to believe that she has outstripped me in audacity, and that makes me her prisoner. Her passion then becomes specific, energetic, conclusive, dialectical; her kiss total, her embrace without hesitation.\u2014In me she seeks her freedom and finds it the better the more firmly I encompass her. The engagement bursts. When that has happened she needs a little rest, so that nothing unseemly will emerge from this wild tumult. Her passion then composes itself once more and she is mine. \u2014from_Either/Or: A Fragment of Life_, (as written by his pseudonym Johannes the Seducer)\u201d","What is to come? What does the future hold? I don\u2019t know, I have no idea. When from a fixed point a spider plunges down as is its nature, it sees always before it an empty space in which it cannot find a footing however much it flounders. That is how it is with me: always an empty space before me, what drives me on is a result that lies behind me. This life is back-to-front and terrible, unendurable.","I have often discovered how profitable it is to give sorrow an ethical expression, not to erase the aesthetic factor in sorrow but to master it ethically. As long as sorrow is quiet and humble, I do not fear it; if it becomes vehement and passionate, sophistical so that it deludes me into despondency, I arise, I brook no rebellion, I will have nothing in the world cheat me of what I have from God\u2019s hand as a gift of grace. I do not chase sorrow away, do not try to forget it, I repent.","In spiritlessness there is no anxiety. It is too happy for that, too content, and too spiritless. But this is a very pitiable reason, and paganism differs from spiritlessness in the former being definable as directed toward spirit and the latter as directed from spirit. Paganism is, if you will, the absence of spirit and thus differs far from spiritlessness. Paganism is in this respect much to be preferred. Spiritlessness is spirit\u2019s stagnation and ideality\u2019s caricature. Spiritlessness is accordingly not literally dumb when it comes to repetition by rote, but it is dumb [has lost its sense] in the way in which it is said of salt that it has lost its flavor\u2020 and when one asks then how it can be salted.","Al\u0163ii sunt virtuo\u015fi ziua \u015fi p\u0103c\u0103tuiesc noaptea;eu ziua sunt pur\u0103 prefec\u0103torie,iar noaptea sunt numai dorin\u0163e.","Freedom is always in communication (even taking the religious meaning of the word into consideration does no harm); unfreedom withdraws ever more in its reserve and will not communicate.","Tambi\xe9n yo he sentido la inclinaci\xf3n a obligarme, casi de una manera demon\xedaca, a ser m\xe1s fuerte de lo que en realidad soy.","an adventure that every human being has to live through, learning to be anxious so as not to be ruined either by never having been in anxiety or by sinking into it. Whoever has learned to be anxious in the right way has learned the ultimate.","No woman in maternity confinement can have stranger and more impatient wishes than I have.","Every individual, however original he may be, is still a child of God, of his age, of his nation, of his family and friends. Only thus is he truly himself. If in all this relativity he tries to be the absolute, then he becomes ridiculous.","In relation to the labyrinth of her heart, every young girl is an Ariadne; she owns the thread by which one can find one\u2019s way through it, but she owns it without herself knowing how to use it.","In the first case, he personally enjoyed the esthetic; in the second case, he esthetically enjoyed his personality.","Riches and abundance come hypocritically clad in sheep\'s clothing, pretending to be security against anxieties, and they become then the object of anxiety. They secure a man against anxieties just about as well as the wolf that is put to tending the sheep.","...The discrepancy is that the ethical self should be found immanently in the despair, that the individual won himself by persisting in the despair. True, he has used something within the category of freedom, choosing himself, which seem to remove the difficulty, one that presumably has not struck many, since philosophically doubting everything and then finding the true beginning goes one, two, three. But that does not help. In despairing, I use myself to despair, and therefore I can indeed despair of everything by myself. But if I do this, I cannot come back by myself. It is in this moment of decision that the individual needs divine assistance, whereas it is quite correct that in order to be at this point one must first have understood the existence-relation between the aesthetic and the ethical; that is to say, by being there in passion and inwardness, one surely becomes aware of the religious - and of the leap.","The more he needs God, the more deeply he comprehends he is in need of God, and then the more he in his need presses forward to God, the more perfect he is... To need God is nothing to be ashamed of but is perfection itself.","I see it perfectly; there are two possible situations - once can either do this or that.

He lost his way in the world. In his need he looked about for a Socrates but found none among his contemporaries. Then he requested the gods to change him into one. But now--he who had been so proud of being an Alcibiades was so humiliated and humbled by the gods\' favor that, just when he received what he could be proud of, he felt inferior to all.","What is youth? A dream. What is love? The dream\u2019s content.","But it is just as useless for a man to want first of all to decide the externals and after that the fundamentals as it is for a cosmic body, thinking to form itself, first of all to decide the nature of its surface, to what bodies it should turn its light, to which its dark side, without first letting the harmony of centrifugal and centripetal forces realize [*realisere*] its existence [*Existents*] and letting the rest come of itself. One must learn first to know himself before knowing anything else (\u03b3\u03bd\u1ff6\u03b8\u03b9 \u03c3\u03b5 \u03b1\u03c5\u03c4\u03cc\u03bd). Not until a man has inwardly understood himself and then sees the course he is to take does his life gain peace and meaning; only then is he free of the irksome, sinister traveling companion\u2015that irony of life which manifests itself in the sphere of knowledge and invites true knowing to begin with a not-knowing (Socrates), just as God created the world from nothing. But in the waters of morality it is especially at home to those who still have not entered the tradewinds of virtue. Here it tumbles a person about in a horrible way, for a time lets him feel happy and content in his resolve to go ahead along the right path, then hurls him into the abyss of despair. Often it lulls a man to sleep with the thought, \\"After all, things cannot be otherwise,\\" only to awaken him suddenly to a rigorous interrogation. Frequently it seems to let a veil of forgetfulness fall over the past, only to make every single trifle appear in a strong light again. When he struggles along the right path, rejoicing in having overcome temptation\'s power, there may come at almost the same time, right on the heels of perfect victory, an apparently insignificant external circumstance which pushes him down, like Sisyphus, from the height of the crag. Often when a person has concentrated on something, a minor external circumstance arises which destroys everything. (As in the case of a man who, weary of life, is about to throw himself into the Thames and at the crucial moment is halted by the sting of a mosquito). Frequently a person feels his very best when the illness is the worst, as in tuberculosis. In vain he tries to resist it but he has not sufficient strength, and it is no help to him that he has gone through the same thing many times; the kind of practice acquired in this way does not apply here. Just as no one who has been taught a great deal about swimming is able to keep afloat in a storm, but only the man who is intensely convinced and has experiences that he is actually lighter than water, so a person who lacks this inward point of poise is unable to keep afloat in life\'s storms.\u2015Only when a man has understood himself in this way is he able to maintain an independent existence and thus avoid surrendering his own I.

Is my love then a work of memory? Even if time expunged everything from its tablets, expunged even memory itself, my relation to you would stay just as alive, you would still not be forgotten. If I could forget you! What then should I remember? For after all, I have forgotten myself in order to remember you: so if I forgot you I would come to remember myself; but the moment I remembered myself I would have to remember you again. If I could forget you! What would happen then? There is a picture from antiquity. It depicts Ariadne. She is leaping up from her couch and gazing anxiously after a ship that is hurrying away under full sail. By her side stands Cupid with unstrung bow and drying his eyes. Behind her stands a winged female figure in a helmet. It is usually assumed this is Nemesis. Imagine this picture, imagine it changed a little. Cupid is not weeping and his bow is not unstrung; or would you have become less beautiful, less victorious, if I had become mad? Cupid smiles and bends his bow. Nemesis does not stand inactive by your side; she too draws her bow. In that other picture we see a male figure on the ship, busily occupied. It is assumed it is Theseus. Not so in my picture. He stands on the stern, he looks back longingly, spreads his arms. He has repented, or rather, his madness has left him, but the ship carries him away. Cupid and Nemesis both aim at him, an arrow flies from each bow; their aim is true; one sees that, one understands, they have both hit the same place in his heart, a sign that his love was the Nemesis that wrought vengeance.\\"  \u2015Johannes de Silentio, from_Either/Or: A Fragment of Life_","By comparison with a passionate age, an age without passion gains in scope what is loses in intensity.","Christianity will not be content to be an evolution within the total category of human nature; an engagement such as that is too little to offer to a god. Neither does it even want to be the paradox for the believer, and then surreptitiously, little by little, provide him with understanding, because the martyrdom of faith (to crucify one\'s understanding) is not a martyrdom of the moment, but the martyrdom of continuance.","On principle\' one can do anything and what one does is, fundamentally, a matter of indifference, just as a man\'s life remains insignificant even though \'on principle\' he gives his support to all the \'needs of the times.","Whatever one generation learns from another, it can never learn from a predecessor the genuinely human factor. In this respect every generation begins afresh, has no task other than that of any previous generation, and comes no further, provided the latter didn\'t shirk its task and deceive itself. This authentically human factor is passion, in which the one generation also fully understands the other and understands itself. Thus no generation has learned from another how to love, no generation can begin other than at the beginning, the task of no later generation is shorter than its predecessor\'s, and if someone, unlike the previous generation, is unwilling to stay with love but wants to go further, then that is simply idle and foolish talk.","Of a man who only wills the Good out of fear of punishment, it is necessary to say with special emphasis, that he fears what a man should not and ought not to fear: loss of money, loss of reputation, misjudgment by others, neglect, the world\u2019s judgment, the ridicule of fools, the laughter of the frivolous, the cowardly whining of consideration, the inflated triviality of the moment, the fluttering mist-forms of vapor.","Socrates proved the immortality of the soul from the fact that the sickness of the soul (sin) does not consume it as sickness of the body consumes the body. So also we can demonstrate the eternal in man from the fact that despair cannot consume his self, that this precisely is the torment of contradiction in despair. If there were nothing eternal in a man, he could not despair; but if despair could consume his self, there would still be no despair.","With every increase in the degree of consciousness, and in proportion to that increase, the intensity of despair increases: the more consciousness the more intense the despair.","All this is only fooling, for if it is true that every man must work for his own salvation, then all the prophecies about the future of the world are only valuable and allowable as a recreation, or a joke, like playing bowls or cards.","If the sphere of paradox-religion is abolished, or explained away in aesthetics, an Apostle becomes neither more nor less than a genius, and then--good night, Christianity! Esprit and the Spirit, revelation and originality, a call from God and genius, all end by meaning more or less the same thing.","It may happen, however, that he falls into despair just for the fact that he has opened his heart to another; it may be that he thinksit would have been infinitely preferable to maintain silence rather than have anyone privy to his secret. There are examples of introverts who are brought to despair precisely because they have acquired a confidant.","In love with myself, that is what people say I am. It doesn\u2019t surprise me, for how could they notice that I can love when I love only you; how could anyone else suspect it when I love only you? In love with myself. Why? Because I\u2019m in love with you, because it is you I love, you alone, and all that truly belongs to you, and it is thus I love myself, because this, my self, belongs to you, so that if I ceased loving you I would cease loving myself. What then is, in the eyes of the profane world, an expression of the greatest egoism, is for your initiated eyes the expression of purest sympathy; what in the profane eyes of the world is an expression of the most prosaic self-preservation, is for your sacred sight the expression of the most enthusiastic self-annihilation.\u2015Johannes de Silentio, from_Either/Or: A Fragment of Life_\u201d","But now how can an Apostle prove that he has authority? If he could prove it physically, then he would not be an Apostle. He has no other proof than his own statement. That has to be so; for otherwise the believer\'s relationship to him would be direct instead of being paradoxical.","In any case one can never forbear to smile at such a despairer, who, humanly speaking, although he is in despair, is so very innocent. Commonly such a despairer is infinitely comic. Think of a self (and next to God there is nothing so eternal as a self), and then that this self gets the notion of asking whether it might not let itself become or be made into another\u2026than itself. And yet such a despairer, whose only wish is this most crazy of all transformations, loves to think that this change might be accomplished as easily as changing a coat. For the immediate man does not recognize his self, he recognizes himself only by his dress, he recognizes (and here again appears the infinitely comic trait) he recognizes that he has a self only by externals.","If there were no eternal consciousness in a man, if at the foundation of all there lay only a wildly seething power which writhing with obscure passions produced everything that is great and everything that is insignificant, if a bottomless void never satiated lay hidden beneath all\u2013what then would life be but despair?","Just as gold is purified in the fire, so the soul is purified in sufferings.","Instead of proclaiming the ideals, they educe what experience teaches, what the experience of all the centuries has taught, that the millions get no further than mediocrity.","if god loves me, he is my mortal enemy","[T]he content of the discourse should be about loving the un-lovable object\u2026 The beloved and the friend are the immediate and direct objects of immediate love, the choice of passion and of inclination. And what is the ugly? It is the neighbor, whom one shall love (373).","An existing individual is constantly in process of becoming,... and translates all his thinking into terms of process. It is with (him)... as it is with a writer and his style; for he only has a style who never has anything finished, but \'moves the waters of the language\' every time he begins, so that the most common expression comes into being for him with the freshness of a new birth.","Love is everything. So, for one who loves, everything has ceased to have meaning in itself and only means something through the interpretation love gives it. Thus if another betrothed became convinced there was some other girl he cared for, he would presumably stand there like a criminal and his fianc\xe9e be outraged. You, however, I know would see a tribute in such a confession; for me to be able to love another you know is an impossibility; it is my love for you casting its reflections over the whole of life. So when I care about someone else, it is not to convince myself that I do not love her but only you\u2014that would be presumptuous; but since my whole soul is filled with you, life takes on another meaning for me: it becomes a myth about you.\\"\u2014Johannes the Seducer, from_Either/Or_","For every single individual who escapes into the crowd... flees in cowardice from being a single individual.","What is a poet? An unhappy man who hides deep anguish in his heart, but whose lips are so formed that when the sigh and cry pass through them, it sounds like lovely music\u2026. And people flock around the poet and say: \u2018Sing again soon\u2019 - that is, \u2018May new sufferings torment your soul but your lips be fashioned as before, for the cry would only frighten us, but the music, that is blissful.","What good would it do me if truth stood before me, cold and naked, not caring whether I recognized her or not?","Everyone take his revenge on the world. My revenge consists in bearing my distress and anguish enclosed deeply within me while my laughter entertains everyone. If I see someone suffer I give him my sympathy, console him as best I can, and listen to him calmly when he assures me that I am fortunate. If only I can keep this up until the day I die I shall have had my revenge","It is (to describe it figuratively) as if an author were to make a slip of the pen, and as if this clerical error became conscious of being such. Perhaps this was no error but in a far higher sense was an essential part of the whole exposition. It is, then, as if this clerical error were to revolt against the author, out of hatred for him, were to forbid him to correct it, and were to say, \\"No, I will not be erased, I will stand as a witness against thee, that thou art a very poor writer.","When indeed does the temporal suffering oppress a man most terribly? Is it not when it seems to him that it has no significance, that it neither secures nor gains anything for him? Is it not when the suffering, as the impatient man expresses it, is without meaning or purpose?","If anything is to be done, one must try to introduce Christianity into Christendom.","I am poor\u2014you are my riches; dark\u2014you are my light; I own nothing, need nothing. And how could I own anything? After all, it is a contradiction that he can own something who does not own himself. I am happy as a child who is neither able to own anything nor allowed to. I own nothing, for I belong only to you; I am not, I have ceased to be, in order to be yours. \u2014Johannes De Silentio, from_Either/Or_\u201d","Let the thunder of a hundred cannon remind you three times daily to resist the force of habit.","After all, it is the best time of one\u2019s life, the first period of falling in love, when with every meeting, every glance, one brings home something new to rejoice over.","I admire you, and yet at times it seems to me as if you were deranged. Or is it not a sort of mental derangement that you subject to such a degree every passion, every emotion of the heart, every mood, to the cold discipline of reflection? Is it not mental derangement to be so normal, to be a mere idea, not a human being like the rest of us, pliant and yielding, capable of being lost and of losing ourselves? Is it not mental derangement to be always awake, always sure, never obscure and dreaming?","Only by investing and speaking yourvision with passion can the truth, oneway or the other, finally penetrate thereluctance of the world.","A Reflex\xe3o \xe9 o anjo exterminador da espontaneidade\u2026 Se fosse verdade que a reflex\xe3o devesse controlar a inclina\xe7\xe3o amorosa, nunca haveria casamento.","So wonderful a power is remorse, so sincere is its friendship that to escape it entirely is the most terrible thing of all.","It is comic that a mentally disordered man picks up any piece of granite and carries it around because he thinks it is money, and in the same way it is comic that Don Juan has 1,003 mistresses, for the number simply indicates that they have no value. Therefore, one should stay within one\u2019s means in the use of the word \\"love\\".","I want to run out of the world, not into a monastery\u2014I still have my strength\u2014but in order to find myself (that is what every fool says), in order to forget myself; nor will I go where the wandering stream / in the meadow is seen.\u2014I don\'t know whether this poem has been written by some poet, but I would wish that an uncompromising irony would compel some sentimental poet to write it, though in such a way that he himself always read something else.

Yes, Echo, avenge all the sentimental nonsense which conceals itself in the forests and meadows, in the church and the theater, and which breaks out there now and then, drowning out everything for me. I do not hear the trees in the forest telling old legends and such. No, to me they whisper all the nonsense to which they have been witness for so long, to me they plead in the name of God to be cut down in order to be freed from these nature worshipers who spout nonsense.\u2014Yes, would that all these drivel-heads sat upon a single neck, then, like Caligula, I would know what to do.","What shall it profit the sick man to imagine himself, as all men do, to be well, if the physician says he is sick!","There are two ways to be fooled. One is to believe what isn\'t true. The other is to refuse to accept what is true.","The truth is introduced \u2013 and with that it enters into the process of history. But unfortunately this does not (as so many ludicrously assume) result in the purification of the idea, which never is purer than in its primitive form. No, it results, with steadily increasing momentum, in garbling the truth, in making it dull, trite, in wearing it out, in introducing impure ingredients that originally were not present. What happens is the very opposite of filtering, until at last, by the enthusiastic cooperation and mutual consent of a number of successive generations, the point is reached where the truth is entirely extinguished and its opposite embraced","Just as the weak, despairing person is unwilling to hear anything about any consolation eternity has for him, so a person in such despair does not want to hear anything about it, either, but for a different reason: this very consolation would be his undoing; as a denunciation of all existence. Figuratively speaking, it is as if an error slipped into an author\'s writing and the error became conscious of itself as an error; perhaps it actually was not a mistake but in a much higher sense an essential part of the whole production, and now this error wants to mutiny against the author, out of hatred toward him, forbidding him to correct it and in maniacal defiance saying to him: No! I refuse to be erased! I will stand as a witness against you; a witness that you are a second-rate author.","Love is the unfathomable ground that is hidden in darkness, but the resolution is the triumphant victor who, like Orpheus, fetches the infatuation of falling in love to the light of day, for the resolution is the true form of love, the true explanation and transfiguration.","This emphasis on the situation was particularly important in order to show that what was central for Socrates was not a fixed point but an ubique et nusquam. It was needed in order to point up the Socratic sensibility which under the subtlest and weakest contact immediately discerned the presence of the Idea, immediately felt the electricity pervading the whole existence.","I need the enchantment of creative work to help me forget life\u2019s mean pettinesses.","sessizliklerin en kesini susmak de\u011fil, konu\u015fmaktir.","Numbers are the most dangerous of all illusions","Just as in earthly life lovers long for the moment when they are able to breath forth their love for each other, to let their souls blend in a soft whisper, so the mystic longs for the moment when in prayer he can, as it were, creep into God","\u0414\u0430, \u0438\u0441\u0442\u0438\u043d\u043d\u0430\u044f \u043b\u044e\u0431\u043e\u0432\u044c \u043d\u0435 \u043f\u043e\u0439\u0434\u0435\u0442 \u0431\u043e\u043b\u044c\u0448\u043e\u0439 \u0434\u043e\u0440\u043e\u0433\u043e\u0439 \u2014 \u043f\u043e \u043d\u0435\u0439 \u0445\u043e\u0434\u0438\u0442 \u0442\u043e\u043b\u044c\u043a\u043e \u0431\u0440\u0430\u043a; \u043e\u043d\u0430 \u043d\u0435 \u0438\u0437\u0431\u0435\u0440\u0435\u0442 \u0438 \u043f\u0440\u043e\u0441\u0435\u043b\u043e\u0447\u043d\u043e\u0439 \u0442\u0440\u043e\u043f\u0438\u043d\u043a\u0438 \u2014 \u0442\u0440\u043e\u043f\u0438\u043d\u043a\u0430 \u044d\u0442\u0430 \u0443\u0436\u0435 \u043f\u0440\u043e\u0442\u043e\u043f\u0442\u0430\u043d\u0430; \u043b\u044e\u0431\u043e\u0432\u044c \u043f\u0440\u0435\u0434\u043f\u043e\u0447\u0438\u0442\u0430\u0435\u0442 \u0441\u0430\u043c\u0430 \u043f\u0440\u043e\u0431\u0438\u0432\u0430\u0442\u044c \u0441\u0435\u0431\u0435 \u0434\u043e\u0440\u043e\u0433\u0443.","The more consciousness there is in such a sufferer who in despair wills to be himself, the more his despair intensifies and becomes demonic. It usually originates as follows. A self that in despair wills to be itself is pained in some distress or other that does not allow itself to be taken away from or separated from his concrete self. So now he makes precisely this torment the object of all his passion, and finally it becomes a demonic age. By now, even if God in heaven and all the angels offered to help him out of it- no, he does not want that, now it is too late. Once he would gladly have given everything to be rid of this agony, but he was kept waiting; now it is too late, now he would rather rage against everything and be the wronged victim of the whole world and of all life, and it is of particular significance to him to make sure that he has his torment on hand and that no one takes it away from him- for then he would not be able to demonstrate and prove to himself that he is right. This eventually becomes such a fixation that for an extremely strange reason he is afraid of eternity, afraid that it will separate him from his, demonically understood, infinite superiority over other men, his justification, demonically understood, for being what he is.","With the daguerreotype everyone will be able to have their portrait taken\u2014formerly it was only the prominent\u2014and at the same time everything is being done to make us all look exactly the same, so we shall only need one portrait.","An individual in despair despairs over something. So it seems for a moment, but only for a moment; in the same moment the true despair or despair in its true form shows itself. In despairing over something, he really despaired over himself, and now he wants to get rid of himself. For example, when the ambitious man whose slogan is \u201cEither Caesar or nothing does not get to be Caesar, he despairs over it. But this also means something else: precisely because he did not get to be Caesar, he now cannot bear to be himself. Consequently he does not despair because he did not get to be Caesar but despairs over himself because he did not get to be Caesar.\u201d","A thinker erects an immense building, a system, a system which embraces the whole of existence and world-history, etc. And if we contemplate his personal life, we discover to our astonishment this terrible and ludicrous fact, that he himself personally does not live in this immense high-vaulted palace, but in a barn alongside of it, or in a dog kennel, or at the most in the porter\u2019s lodge. If one were to take the liberty of calling his attention to this by a single word, he would be offended. For he has no fear of being under a delusion, if only he can get the system completed\u2026 by means of the delusion.","If a pastor\'s activity in the church is merely a once-a-week attempt to tow the congregation\'s cargo ship a little closer to eternity, the whole thing comes to nothing. A human life, unlike a cargo ship, cannot lie in the same place until the next Sunday.","Philosophy cannot and should not give faith, but it should understand itself and know what it has to offer and take nothing away, and least of all should fool people out of something as if it were nothing. I am not unacquainted with the perplexities and dangers of life, I do not fear them, and I encounter them buoyantly. I am not unacquainted with the dreadful, my memory is a faithful wife, and my imagination is (as I myself am not) a diligent little maiden who all day sits quietly at her work, and in the evening knows how to chat to me about it so prettily that I must look at it, though not always, I must say, is it landscapes, or flowers, or pastoral idylls she paints.","Oleminen ei ole mukavuuskysymys.","Only the lower natures forget themselves and become something new.

A revolutionary but passionless and reflecting age changes the manifestation of power into a dialectical sleight-of-hand, letting everything remain but slyly defrauding it of its meaning; it culminates, instead of in an uprising, in the exhaustion of the inner reality of the relationships, in a reflecting tension that nevertheless lets everything remain; and it has transformed the whole of existence into an equivocation.","What is truth but to live for an idea?","For the outward world is subjected to the law of imperfection, and again and again the experience is repeated that he too who does not work gets the bread, and that he who sleeps gets it more abundantly than the man who works.

It begins with the teaching about sin. The category of sin is the category of individuality. Sin cannot be thought speculativelyat all. The individual human being lies beneath the concept; an individual human being cannot be thought, but only the concept \\"man.\\" \u2014That is why speculation promptly embarks upon the teaching about the predominance of the generation over the individual, for it is too much to expect that speculation should acknowledge the impotence of the concept in relation to actuality. \u2014But just as one individual person cannot be thought, neither can one individual sinner; sin can be thought (then it becomes negation), but not one individual sinner. That is precisely why there is no earnestness about sin if it is only to be thought, for earnestness is simply this: that you and I are sinners. Earnestness is not sin in general; rather, the accent of earnestness rests on the sinner, who is the single individual. With respect to \\"the single individual,\\" speculation, if it is consistent, must make light of being a single individual or being that which cannot be thought. If it cares to do anything along this line, it must say to the individual: Is this anything to waste your time on? Forget it! To be an individual human being is to be nothing! Think\u2014then you are all mankind: cogito ergo sum [I think therefore I am]. But perhaps that is a lie; perhaps instead the single individual human being and to be a single human being are the highest. Just suppose it is. To be completely consistent, then, speculation must also say: To be an individual sinner is not to be something; it lies beneath the concept; do not waste any time on it etc. [. . .] Sin is a qualification of the single individual; it is irresponsibility and new sin to pretend as if it were nothing to be an individual sinner\u2014when one himself is this individual sinner. Here Christianity steps in, makes the sign of the cross before speculation; it is just as impossible for speculation to get around this issue as for a sailing vessel to sail directly against a contrary wind. The earnestness of sin is its actuality in the single individual, be it you or I. Speculatively, we are supposed to look away from the single individual; therefore, speculatively, we can speak only superficially about sin. The dialectic of sin is diametrically contrary to that of speculation","Fortvivlelsens Misforhold er ikke et simpelt Misforhold, men et Misforhold i et Forhold, der forholder sig til sig selv, og er sat af et Andet, saa Misforholdet i hiint for sig v\xe6rende Forhold tillige reflekterer sig uendeligt i Forholdet til den Magt, som satte det.","A man ten times regrets havingspoken, for the once he regrets his silence. And why? Because the factof having spoken is an external fact, which may involve one inannoyances, since it is an actuality. But the fact of having kept silent!Yet this is the most dangerous thing of all. For by keeping silent one isrelegated solely to oneself, no actuality comes to a man\u2019s aid bypunishing him, by bringing down upon him the consequences of hisspeech. No, in this respect, to be silent is the easy way. But he whoknows what the dreadful is, must for this very reason be most fearfulof every fault, of every sin, which takes an inward direction and leavesno outward trace.","No puedo evitar sonre\xedrme cuando pienso la habilidad con la que s\xe9 pronunciar su nombre, ese nombre, en un momento decisivo.","Ten\xeda una confidente \xedntima -mi melancol\xeda-, y en medio de mi alegr\xeda, en medio de mi trabajo, ella me atrae, me llama a un lado aunque f\xedsicamente yo permanezca en el lugar.

This, of course, is because the ancient world did not have subjectivity reflected in itself. Even if the individual moved freely, he nevertheless rested in substantial determinants, in the state, the family, in fate. This substantial determinant is the essential fateful factor in Greek tragedy and is its essential characteristic. The hero\'s downfall, therefore, is not a result solely of his action but is also a suffering, whereas in modern tragedy the hero\'s downfall is not really suffering but is a deed. Thus, in the modern period situation and character are in fact predominant","After my death, no one will find in my papers (this is my consolation) the least information about what has really filled my life, find the inscription in my innermost being which explains everything and what, more often than not, makes what the world would call trifles into, for me, events of immense importance, and which I too consider of no significance once I take away the secret note which explains it.","So soon as I talk I express the universal, and if I do not do so, no one can understand me.","In infinite resignation there is peace and repose; anyone who wants it, who has not debased himself by\u2014what is still worse than being too proud\u2014belittling himself, can discipline himself into making this movement, which in its pain reconciles one to existence.","Things here go just as they did with me and my physician.

And that is how it is with us human beings. All of earthly existence is a sort of infirmity.","Creo que se podr\xeda vivir constantemente absorto en la contemplaci\xf3n de un ser femenino.","There is not a single human being who does not despair at least a little, in whose innermost being there does not dwell an uneasiness, an unquiet, a discordance, an anxiety in the face of an unknown something.","With his Don Juan Mozart enters the little immortal circle of those whose names, whose works, time will not forget, because eternity remembers them.

An admirer who feels that he cannot become happy by abandoning himself to it chooses to be envious of that which he admires.

Admiration is happy self-surrender; envy is unhappy self-assertion.","life has always in store analogous phenomena which perhaps one will not escape.

But each was great in his own way, and each in proportion to the greatness of that which he loved. For he who loved himself became great by himself, and he who loved other men became great by his selfless devotion, but he who loved God became greater than all. Everyone shall be remembered, but each became great in proportion to his expectation. One became great by expecting the possible, another by expecting the eternal, but he who expected the impossible became greater than all.","There are two ways to be fooled: one is to believe what isn\'t true, the other is to refuse to believe what is true.","It costs a man just as much or even more to go to hell than to come to heaven.

This is what my soul thirsts for as the African deserts thirst for water. This is what I need to live, a completely human life and not merely one of knowledge","What is it to be God\'s elect? It is to be denied in youth the wishes of youth, so as with great pains to get them fulfilled in old age.","He who loves God without faith reflects on himself, while the person who loves God in faith reflects on God.","To love him who makes one happy, is to a reflective mind an inadequate definition of what love is; to love him who made one unhappy out of malice, is virtue; but to love him who out of love, though by a misunderstanding, yet out of love, made one unhappy \u2013 that is the formula never yet enunciated, so far as I know, but nevertheless the normal formula in reflection for what it is to love.","Wenn man die Philosophen von der Wirklichkeit reden h\xf6rt, so ist das oft ebenso irref\xfchrend, wie wenn man im Schaufenster eines Tr\xf6dlers auf einem Schild die Worte liest: Hier wird gerollt.

Der Schild h\xe4ngt nur zum Verkauf da.","When it is stated in Genesis that God said to Adam, \\"Only from the tree of the knowledge of good and evil you must not eat,\\" it follows as a matter of course that Adam really has not understood this word, for how could he understand the difference between good and evil when this distinction would follow as a consequence of the enjoyment of the fruit?When it is assumed that the prohibition awakens the desire, one acquires knowledge instead of ignorance, and in that case Adam must have had a knowledge of freedom, because the desire was to use it. The explanation is therefore subsequent. The prohibition induces in him anxiety, for the prohibition awakens in him freedom\'s possibility. What passed by innocence as the nothing of anxiety has now entered into Adam, and here again it is a nothing -the anxious possibility of","Marry, and you will regret it; don\u2019t marry, you will also regret it; marry or don\u2019t marry, you will regret it either way. Laugh at the world\u2019s foolishness, you will regret it; weep over it, you will regret that too\u2026 Hang yourself, you will regret it; do not hang yourself, and you will regret that too; hang yourself or don\u2019t hang yourself, you\u2019ll regret it either way; whether you hang yourself or do not hang yourself, you will regret both. This, gentlemen, is the essence of all philosophy","Such works are mirrors: when an ape peers into them, no Apostle can be seen looking out.","Whereas in the old days one acquired eternal happiness by the grace of God, now too often the eternal happiness seems to have become like an aged and infirm pensioner who sustains his life in the house of the rich on the wretched crust of poverty.","It is not what happens to me that makes me great, but what I do.","That one is in despair is not a rarity; no, it is rare, very rare, that one is\u2026not in despair.","Love for that princess became for him the expression for an eternal love, assumed a religious character, was transfigured into a love for the Eternal Being, which did to be sure deny him the fulfilment of his love, yet reconciled him again by the eternal consciousness of its validity in the form of eternity, which no reality can take from him.","The majority of men are curtailed \\"I\'s\\"; what was planned by nature as a possibility capable of being sharpened into an I is soon dulled into a third person.","The most painful state of being is remembering the future, particularly one you can never have.","Every person shudders at becoming a personality, shudders at standing as a personality vis-\xe0-vis others\u2015he shudders at it because he knows very well that this makes it possible for the others to catch sight of him. The human being shudders at becoming manifest; thus he loves, if not pitch darkness, then at any rate twilight, mystification, impersonality.","Hence it is a superficial view (which presumably has never seen a person in despair, not even one\u2019s own self) when it is said of a man in despair, \\"He is consuming himself.\\" For precisely this it is he despairs of, and to his torment it is precisely this he cannot do, since by despair fire has entered into something that cannot burn, or cannot burn up, that is, into the self.","A poet is an unhappy being whose heart it torn by secret sufferings, but whose lips are so strangely formed that when the sighs and the cries escape them, they sound like beautiful music.","Do not fly so high with your decisions that you forget that a decision is but a beginning. How wretched and miserable it is to find in a person many good intentions but few good deeds. And there are other dangers too, dangers of sin. With all your good intentions, you must not forget your duty, neither should you forget to do it with joy. And strive to carry your burdens and responsibilities in a surrendered way. If you don\u2019t, there is a danger of losing your decisiveness; of going through life without courage and fading away in death.","The two will preserve their love young and sound, she also will have triumphed over her pains, even though she does not, as it is said in the ballad, \xab lie every night beside her lord. \xbb These two will to all eternity remain in agreement with one another, with a well-timed harmonia praestabilita, so that if ever the moment were to come, the moment which does not, however, concern them finitely (for then they would be growing older), if ever the moment were to come which offered to give love its expression in time, then they will be capable of beginning precisely at the point where they would have begun if originally they had been united. He","salvation consists primarily in his beginning to sorrow earnestly over himself!","Unless you grasp that it requires all the strength of spirit to die, that the hero always dies before his death, you will not come particularly far in your observations on life.","In a theater it happened that a fire stated offstage. The clown came out to tell the audience. They thought it was a joke and applauded. He told them again, and they became still more hilarious. This is the way, I suppose, that the world will be destroyed- amid the universal hilarity of wits and wags who think it is all a joke.","Anxiety may be the dizziness of freedom.","Is it not possible that my activity as an objective observer of nature will weaken my strength as a human being?","Subjectivity is truth and if subjectivity is in existing, then, if I may put it this way, Christianity is a perfect fit.","For, humanly speaking, death is the last thing of all; and, humanly speaking, there is hope only so long as there is life. But Christianly understood death is by no means the last thing of all, hence it is only a little event within that which is all, an eternal life; and Christianly understood there is in death infinitely much more hope than merely humanly speaking there is when there not only is life but this life exhibits the fullest health and vigor.","Suppose someone wanting to learn to dance said: \'For hundreds of years now one generation after another has been learning dance steps, it\'s high time I took advantage of this and began straight off with a set of quadrilles.\' One would surely laugh a little at him: but in the world of spirit such an attitude is considered utterly plausible. What then is education? I had thought it was the curriculum the individual ran through in order to catch up with himself; and anyone who does not want to go through this curriculum will be little helped by being born into the most enlightened age.","A f\xe9 n\xe3o constitui, portanto, um impulso de ordem est\xe9tica; \xe9 de outra ordem muito mais elevada, justamente porque pressup\xf5e a resigna\xe7\xe3o.

With a premature anxiety I have tried to avoid coming in close contact with those things whose force of attraction might be too powerful for me. I have sought to appropriate much from them, studied their distinctive characteristics and meaning in human life, but at the same time guarded against coming, like the moth, too close to the flame. I have had little to win or to lose in association with the ordinary run of men, partly because what they do\u2015so-called practical life\u2015does not interest me much, partly because their coldness and indifference to the spiritual and deeper currents in man alienate me even more from them. With few exceptions my companions have had no special influence upon me. A life that has not arrived at clarity about itself must necessarily exhibit an uneven side-surface; confronted by certain facts [*Facta*] and their apparent disharmony, they simply halted there, for, as I see it, they did not have sufficient interest to seek a resolution in a higher harmony or to recognize the necessity of it. Their opinion of me was always one-sided, and I have vacillated between putting too much or too little weight on what they said. I have now withdrawn from their influence and the potential variations of my life\'s compass resulting from it. Thus I am again standing at the point where I must begin again in another way. I shall now calmly attempt to look at myself and begin to initiate inner action; for only thus will I be able, like a child calling itself \\"I\\" in its first consciously undertaken act, be able to call myself \\"I\\" in a profounder sense.But that takes stamina, and it is not possible to harvest immediately what one has sown. I will remember that philosopher\'s method of having his disciples keep silent for three years; then I dare say it will come. Just as one does not begin a feast at sunrise but at sundown, just so in the spiritual world one must first work forward for some time before the sun really shines for us and rises in all its glory; for although it is true as it says that God lets his sun shine upon the good and the evil and lets the rain fall on the just and the unjust, it is not so in the spiritual world. So let the die be cast\u2015I am crossing the Rubicon! No doubt this road takes me into battle, but I will not renounce it. I will not lament the past\u2015why lament? I will work energetically and not waste time in regrets, like the person stuck in a bog and first calculating how far he has sunk without recognizing that during the time he spends on that he is sinking still deeper. I will hurry along the path I have found and shout to everyone I meet: Do not look back as Lot\'s wife did, but remember that we are struggling up a hill.\\"\u2015from_Journals_, (The Search for Personal Meaning)","This is quite as clear to the knight of faith, so the only thing that can save him is the absurd, and this he grasps by faith. So he recognizes the impossibility, and that very instant he believes the absurd ; for, if without recognizing the impossibility with all the passion of his soul and with all his heart, he should wish to imagine that he has faith, he deceives himself, and his testimony has no bearing, since he has not even reached the infinite resignation. Faith therefore is not an aesthetic emotion but something far higher, precisely because it has resignation as its presupposition ; it is not an immediate instinct of the heart, but is the paradox of life and existence.","our Lord satisfied the stomach before satisfying the eye, but the imagination acts in the reverse fashion","Confess your love, you will regret it, confess it not, you will also regret that; confessing your love or not confessing your love, you will regret both; whether you confess your love or not confess your love, you will regret both.","A necessidade de solid\xe3o revela sempre a nossa espiritualidade, e serve para dar a sua medida. \\"Essa esp\xe9cie estouvada de homens, que o n\xe3o s\xe3o, esse rebanho de insepar\xe1veis\\" sentem-no t\xe3o pouco que, como os periquitos, morrem, mal se veem sozinhos; como a criancinha que n\xe3o adormece sem uma can\xe7\xe3o, \xe9-lhes necess\xe1rio, para comer, beber, dormir, orar e apaixonar-se, etc, o trauteio tranquilizador da sociabilidade.

For every man is primitively planned to be a self, appointed to become oneself; and while it is true that every self as such is angular, the logical consequence of this merely is that it has to be polished, not that it has to be ground smooth, not that for fear of men it has to give up entirely being itself, nor even that for fear of men it dare not be itself in its essential accidentality (which precisely is what should not be ground away), by which in fine it is itself. But while one sort of despair plunges wildly into the infinite and loses itself, a second sort permits itself as it were to be defrauded by \u201cthe others. By seeing the multitude of men about it, by getting engaged in all sorts of worldly affairs, by becoming wise about how things go in this world, such a man forgets himself, forgets what his name is (in the divine understanding of it), does not dare to believe in himself, finds it too venturesome a thing to be himself, far easier and safer to be like the others, to become an imitation, a number, a cipher in the crowd.\u201d","The one who in mortal danger forgets himself and lets the other have the only life-saving plank, that one loves much.

It is indeed very far from being true that, literally understood, one dies of this sickness, or that this sickness ends with bodily death.

So to be sick unto death is, not to be able to die -- yet not as though there were hope of life; no the hopelessness in this case is that even the last hope, death, is not available. When death is the greatest danger, one hopes for life; but when one becomes acquainted with an even more dreadful danger, one hopes for death.

I was carried up into the seventh heaven. There all the gods sat assembled. By special grace I was granted the favor of a wish. \\"Will you,\\" said Mercury, \\"have youth, or beauty, or power, or a long life, or the most beautiful maiden, or any of the other glories we have in the chest? Choose, but only one thing.\\" For a moment I was at a loss. Then I addressed myself to the gods as follows: \\"Most honorable contemporaries, I choose this one thing, that I may always have the laugh on my side.\\" Not one of the gods said a word, on the contrary, they all began to laugh. Hence, I concluded that my request was granted, and found that the gods knew how to express themselves with taste; for it would hardly have been suitable for them to have answered gravely: \\"It is granted thee.","Anxiety may be compared with dizziness. He whose eye happens to look down into the yawning abyss becomes dizzy. But what is the reason for this? It is just as much in his own eyes as in the abyss . . .

What else can one expect from following the truth?","Anxiety is a response to the awareness of one\u2019s freedom, of one\u2019s power to gaze into the yawning abyss of possibilities, and through an act of choice actualize one of those potentialities. It is a response to the recognition that one is free to choose from possibilities, and therefore ultimately responsible for oneself and one\u2019s future.

For it may not be the inner anxiety of heart but only the momentary feeling that presents the guilt so actively. This kind of repentance is selfish, a matter of the senses, sensually powerful for the moment, excited in expression, impatient in the most diverse exaggerations \u2014 and, just on this account, is not real repentance. Sudden repentance would drink down all the bitterness of sorrow in a single draught and then hurry on. It wants to get away from guilt. It wants to banish all recollection of it, fortifying itself by imagining that it does this in order not to be held back in the pursuit of the Good. It is its wish that guilt, after a time, might be wholly forgotten. And once again, this is impatience.

But there is a concerned guide, a knowing one, who attracts the attention of the wanderer, who calls out to him that he should take care. That guide is remorse.

For the eager traveler who travels lightly along the way does not, in this fashion, learn to know it as well as a wayfarer with a heavy burden. The one who merely strives to get on does not learn to know the way as well as the remorseful man. The eager traveler hurries forward to the new, to the novel, and, indeed, away from experience. But the remorseful one, who comes behind, laboriously gathers up experience.","Life must be lived forwards, but can only be understood backwards.","For when an old man relives his life, he lives it only by dwelling upon his memories; and when wisdom in an old man has outgrown the immediate impressions of life, the past viewed from the quiet of memory is something different from the present in all its bustle.

Moreover repentance delays action, and action is precisely what ethics demands. Finally, repentance must become an object to itself, seeing that the moment of repentance becomes a deficit of action.","Above all, do not lose your desire to walk: every day I walk myself into a state of well being and walk away from every illness.","For clarity\'s sake, and before going further with this account, I shall identify true aesthetic sorrow a little more closely. Sorrow has the opposite movement to that of pain. So long as one doesn\'t spoil things out of a misplaced mania for consistency\u2015something I shall prevent also in another way\u2015one may say: the more innocence, the deeper the sorrow. If you press this too far, you destroy the tragic. There is always an element of guilt left over, but it is never properly reflected in the subject; which is why in Greek tragedy the sorrow is so deep. In order to prevent misplaced consistency, I shall merely remark that exaggeration only succeeds in carrying the matter over into another sphere. The synthesis of absolute innocence and absolute guilt is not an aesthetic feature but a metaphysical one. This is the real reason why people have always been ashamed to call the life of Christ a tragedy; one feels instinctively that aesthetic categories do not exhaust the matter. It is clear in another way, too that Christ\'s life amounts to more than can be exhausted in aesthetic terms, namely from the fact that these terms neutralize themselves in this phenomenon, and are rendered irrelevant. Tragic action always contains an element of suffering, and tragic suffering an element of action; the aesthetic lies in the relativity. The identity of an absolute action and an absolute suffering is beyond the powers of aesthetics and belongs to metaphysics. This identity is exemplified in the life of Christ, for His suffering is absolute because the action is absolutely free, and His action is absolute suffering because it is absolute obedience. The element of guilt that is always left over is, accordingly, not subjectively reflected and this makes the sorrow deep. Tragic guilt is more than just subjective guilt, it is inherited guilt. But inherited guilt, like original sin, is a substantial category, and it is just this substantiality that makes the sorrow deeper. Sophocles\' celebrated tragic trilogy, *Oedipus at Colonus*, *Oedipus Rex*, and *Antigone*, turns essentially on this authentic tragic interest. But inherited guilt contains the self-contradiction of being guilt yet not being guilt. The bond that makes the individual guilty is precisely piety, but the guilt which he thereby incurs has all possible aesthetic ambiguity. One might well conclude that the people who developed profound tragedy were the Jews. Thus, when they say of Jehova that he is a jealous God who visits the sins of the fathers on the children unto the third and fourth generations, or one hears those terrible imprecations in the Old Testament, one might feel tempted to look here for the material of tragedy. But Judaism is too ethically developed for this. Jehova\'s curses, terrible as they are, are nevertheless also righteous punishment. Such was not the case in Greece, there the wrath of the gods has no ethical, but aesthetic ambiguity\\" (Either/Or).","Surrounded by hordes of people, busy with all sorts of secular matters, more and more shrewd about the ways of the world \u2013 such a person forgets himself, forgets his name divinely understood, does not dare to believe in himself, finds it too risky to be himself, far easier and safer to be like the others, to become a copy, a number, part of the crowd.","Mine\u2019: what does this word mean?

My God is not the God that belongs to me, but the God to whom I belong; and so, too, when I say my native land, my home, my calling, my longing, my hope. If there had been no immortality before, this thought that I am yours would be a breach of the normal course of nature. \u2014Johannes the Seducer, from_Either/Or_\u201d","Do you not know that there comes a midnight hour when every one has to throw off his mask? Do you believe that life will always let itself be mocked? Do you think you can slip away a little before midnight in order to avoid this? Or are you not terrified by it? I have seen men in real life who so long deceived others that at last their true nature could not reveal itself;\u2026 In every man there is something which to a certain degree prevents him from becoming perfectly transparent to himself; and this may be the case in so high a degree, he may be so inexplicably woven into relationships of life which extend far beyond himself that he almost cannot reveal himself. But he who cannot reveal himself cannot love, and he who cannot love is the most unhappy man of all.","metaphysics, the mood becomes that of dialectical uniformity and disinterestedness, which ponder sin as something that cannot withstand the scrutiny of thought. The concept of sin is also altered, for sin is indeed to be overcome, yet","What am I?

But to will only one thing, genuinely to will the Good, as an individual, to will to hold fast to God, which things each person without exception is capable of doing, this is what unites.","The spirit of dialectical fearlessness is not so easily acquired; and the sense of isolation which remains despite the conviction of right, the sadness of the parting from admired and trustworthy [or trusted?] authorities, is the line of demarcation which marks the threshold of its acquirement.","When the discoveries of possibility are honestly administered, possibility will discover all finitudes but idealize them in the shape of infinity, in anxiety overwhelm the individual, until the individual again overcomes them in the anticipation of faith.","However, a self, every instant it exists, is in process of becoming, for the self [potentially] does not actually exist, it is only that which it is to become. In so far as the self does not become itself, it is not its own self; but not to be one\u2019s own self is despair.","A Panegyric upon Abraham","Passion excites, earthly wisdom cools, but neither this heat nor this coolness, nor the blending of the heat and coolness is the pure air of the eternal. There is in this heat something ardent, and in this coolness something sharp, and in the blending of the two something indefinite, or an unconscious deceitfulness, as in the hazardous season of spring. But this \'thou shalt love\' takes away all the unsoundness and preserves the soundness of eternity.","God mocks the greatness of man by forging them into the law of occasion, so a person in turn mocks by making the occasion in to everything and the next moment into foolishness, whereby God then becomes superfluous, the concept of wise Governance becomes a piece of folly, the occasion becomes a wag who pokes fun at God just as much as at man, so that all existence ends in a jest, a joke, a charade.","Exist\u0103 mai multe feluri de ro\u015fea\u0163\u0103 feminin\u0103.E mai \xeent\xe2i,ro\u015ful grosier al c\u0103r\u0103mizii.De el se servesc autorii de romane c\xe2nd \xee\u015fi fac eroinele s\u0103 ro\u015feasc\u0103 iar \u015fi iar.E apoi ro\u015fea\u0163a fin\u0103;zorii spiritului de nepre\u0163uit la o fat\u0103 t\xe2n\u0103r\u0103.Apoi ro\u015fea\u0163a furi\u015f\u0103,adus\u0103 de o idee fericit\u0103:frumoas\u0103 la un b\u0103rbat,mai frumoas\u0103 la un adolescent,\xeenc\xe2nt\u0103toare la o femeie.E lumina fulgerului,str\u0103fulgerarea c\u0103ldurii spiritului.E foarte frumoas\u0103 la un adolescent,e \xeenc\xe2nt\u0103toare la o fat\u0103 t\xe2n\u0103r\u0103,fiindc\u0103 se arat\u0103 \xeen toat\u0103 virginitatea ei,\u015fi de aceea are pudoarea surprizei.Cu c\xe2t \xeemb\u0103tr\xe2ne\u015fti cu at\xe2t ro\u015fea\u0163a dispare.","Something wonderful has happened to me. I was carried up into the seventh heaven. There all the gods sat assembled. By special grace I was granted the favor of a wish. \\"Will you,\\" said Mercury, \\"have youth, or beauty, or power, or a long life, or the most beautiful maiden, or any of the other glories we have in the chest? Choose, but only one thing.\\" For a moment I was at a loss. Then I addressed myself to the gods as follows: \\"Most honorable contemporaries, I choose this one thing, that I may always have the laugh on my side.\\" Not one of the gods said a word, on the contrary, they all began to laugh. Hence, I concluded that my request was granted, and found that the gods knew how to express themselves with great taste; for it would hardly have been suitable for them to answer gravely: \\"It is granted thee\\".","Tap for all del ikke lysten til \xe5 g\xe5: jeg g\xe5r meg til det daglige velbefinnende hver dag og g\xe5r fra enhver sykdom; jeg har g\xe5tt meg til mine beste tanker og jeg kjenner ingen tanke s\xe5 tung at man ikke kan g\xe5 fra den.","There is something spectral about me - and this is both the good and the bad in me - something that makes it impossible for anyone to endure having to see me every day and thus have a real relationship with me. Of course, in the light cloak in which I generally show myself, it is another matter. But at home it would be noted that I fundamentally dwell in a spirit world. I had been engaged to her for 1 year, and she did not really know me. - So she would have been shattered. In turn, she would probably have made a mess of me, for I was constantly overstraining myself with her because in a certain sense reality was too light. I was too heavy for her, and she was too light for me, but both can truly lead to overstraining myself.","What is it to be God\u2019s elect ? It is to be denied in youth the wishes of youth, so as with great pains to get them fulfilled in old age.","To go beyond Hegel is a miracle, but to get beyond Abraham is the easiest thing of all. I for my part have devoted a good deal of time to the understanding of the Hegelian philosophy, I believe also that I understand it tolerably well, but when in spite of the trouble I have taken there are certain passages I cannot understand, I am foolhardy enough to think that he himself has not been quite clear. All","Why then did Abraham do it ? For God\u2019s sake, and (in complete identity with this) for his own sake. He did it for God\u2019s sake because God required this proof of his faith ; for his own sake he did it in order that he might furnish the proof.","Kierkegaard lo niega: placer f\xedsico y reflexi\xf3n no pueden convivir).","By my own strength I am able to give up the princess, and I shall not become a grumbler, but shall find joy and repose in my pain ; but by my own strength I am not able to get her again, for I am employing all my strength to be resigned. But by faith, says that marvellous knight, by faith I shall get her in virtue of the absurd.","For when faith is eliminated by becoming null or nothing, then there only remains the crude fact that Abraham wanted to murder Isaac \u2013 which is easy enough for anyone to imitate who has not faith, the faith, that is to say, which makes it hard for him. 1","Con toda seguridad, quien induce al error a los dem\xe1s, debe caer tambi\xe9n en este mismo error.

He grieves. But he is a sincere and faithful friend.","I lie stretched out, inert; all I see is emptiness, all I live on is emptiness, all I move in is emptiness. I do not even suffer pain.

But the ultimate potentiation of every passion is always to will its own downfall, and so it is also the ultimate passion of the understanding to will the collision, although in one way or another the collision must become its downfall. This, then, is the ultimate paradox of thought: to want to discover something that thought itself cannot think.","Whenever nowadays we hear the words \u2018That\u2019s to be judged by the outcome\u2019 we know immediately with whom we have the honour of conversing. Those who speak thus are a populous tribe which, to give them a common name, I shall call the \u2018lecturers\u2019. They live in their thoughts, secure in life, they have a permanent position and sure prospects in a well-organized State; they are separated by centuries, even millennia, from the convulsions of existence; they have no fear that such things could happen again; what would the police and the newspapers say? Their lifework is to judge the great, to judge them according to the outcome. Such conduct in respect of greatness betrays a strange mixture of arrogance and pitifulness, arrogance because they feel called to pass judgement, pitifulness because they feel their lives unrelated in even the remotest manner to those of the great.","From this, however, it does not follow that the ethical is to be abolished, but it acquires an entirely different expression, the paradoxical expression \u2013 that, for example, love to God may cause the knight of faith to give his love to his neighbor the opposite expression to that which, ethically speaking, is required by duty. If","The sorcerer Virgil had himself chopped in pieces and placed in a cauldron to be cooked for eight days, thus to become rejuvenated.10 He had someone watch out that no intruder peeped into the cauldron. The watchman was unable, however, to resist the temptation. It was too soon. Virgil disappeared with a cry, like a little child. I, too, have probably looked too early into the cauldron, into the cauldron of life and its historical development, and no doubt will never manage to be more than a child. [\u2026]","What to me also seems most striking in this respect is how the great poetic geniuses (an Ossian, a Homer) are presented as blind. Naturally it doesn\'t matter to me whether they really were blind; the point is people have imagined them so, as if to indicate that what they saw when they sang of the beauty of nature appeared not to the external eye but to an inner intuition. How remarkable that one of the writers on bees - yes, the best of them - was blind from early youth; it\'s as if to show that here, where you would have thought external observation so important, he had found that point and from it was then able by purely mental activity to infer back to all particulars and reconstruct them in analogy with nature.","The thought of death gives the earnest person the right momentum in life and the right goal toward which he directs his momentum","Kazna odgovara krivici: da nam bude uskra\u0107eno svako zadovoljstvo\u017eivljenja, da smo dovedeni do najvi\u0161eg stepena odvratnosti prema \u017eivotu.","\u0622\u0647 \u0627\u064a\u0651\u0648\u0628! \u0622\u0647! \u0627\u06cc \u0627\u064a\u0651\u0648\u0628! \u0622\u064a\u0627 \u0628\u0631\u0627\u0633\u062a\u06cc \u062a\u0648 \u0686\u064a\u0632\u06cc \u0628\u0647 \u063a\u064a\u0631 \u0627\u0632 \u0627\u064a\u0646 \u0643\u0644\u0645\u0627\u062a \u0632\u064a\u0628\u0627 \u0628\u0631 \u0632\u0628\u0627\u0646 \u0646\u064a\u0627\u0648\u0631\u062f\u06cc: \u062e\u062f\u0627\u0648\u0646\u062f \u062f\u0627\u062f \u0648 \u062e\u062f\u0627\u0648\u0646\u062f \u06af\u0631\u0641\u062a: \u0648 \u0646\u0627\u0645 \u062e\u062f\u0627\u0648\u0646\u062f \u0645\u062a\u0628\u0631\u0643 \u0628\u0627\u062f\u061f \u0622\u064a\u0627 \u0627\u064a\u0646\u200c\u0647\u0627 \u062a\u0646\u0647\u0627 \u0643\u0644\u0645\u0627\u062a\u06cc \u0628\u0648\u062f \u0643\u0647 \u0628\u0631 \u0632\u0628\u0627\u0646 \u0622\u0648\u0631\u062f\u06cc\u061f \u0628\u0627 \u062a\u0645\u0627\u0645 \u062f\u0631\u062f \u0648 \u0639\u0630\u0627\u0628\u06cc \u0643\u0647 \u0643\u0634\u064a\u062f\u06cc \u0641\u0642\u0637 \u0647\u0645\u064a\u0646\u200c\u0647\u0627 \u0631\u0627 \u062a\u0643\u0631\u0627\u0631 \u0643\u0631\u062f\u06cc\u061f \u0686\u0631\u0627 \u0647\u0641\u062a \u0631\u0648\u0632 \u0648 \u0647\u0641\u062a \u0634\u0628 \u062e\u0627\u0645\u0648\u0634 \u0645\u0627\u0646\u062f\u06cc\u060c \u062f\u0631 \u0631\u0648\u062d\u062a \u0622\u062e\u0631 \u0686\u0647 \u0645\u06cc\u200c\u06af\u0630\u0634\u062a\u061f \u0647\u0646\u06af\u0627\u0645\u06cc \u0643\u0647 \u062a\u0645\u0627\u0645 \u0647\u0633\u062a\u06cc \u0628\u0631 \u0633\u0631\u062a \u062e\u0631\u0627\u0628 \u0634\u062f \u0648 \u0647\u0645\u0686\u0648 \u062a\u0643\u0647\u200c\u0647\u0627\u06cc \u0633\u0641\u0627\u0644\u06cc \u0634\u0643\u0633\u062a\u0647 \u062f\u0631 \u0627\u0637\u0631\u0627\u0641 \u067e\u0627\u0647\u0627\u064a\u062a \u067e\u062e\u0634\u200c\u0648\u200c\u067e\u0644\u0627 \u0634\u062f\u060c \u0622\u064a\u0627 \u0628\u0644\u0627\u0641\u0627\u0635\u0644\u0647 \u0628\u0647 \u0627\u064a\u0646 \u0634\u0643\u0644 \u0641\u0648\u0642 \u0628\u0634\u0631\u06cc \u0628\u0631 \u062e\u0648\u062f \u0645\u0633\u0644\u0637 \u06af\u0634\u062a\u06cc\u060c \u0622\u064a\u0627 \u0628\u0644\u0627\u0641\u0627\u0635\u0644\u0647 \u0628\u0647 \u0627\u064a\u0646 \u062a\u0639\u0628\u064a\u0631 \u0627\u0632 \u0639\u0634\u0642 \u062f\u0633\u062a \u064a\u0627\u0641\u062a\u06cc\u060c \u0628\u0647 \u0627\u064a\u0646 \u067e\u064f\u0631\u062f\u0644\u06cc \u0628\u0631\u062e\u0627\u0633\u062a\u0647 \u0627\u0632 \u0627\u064a\u0645\u0627\u0646 \u0648 \u0627\u0639\u062a\u0645\u0627\u062f\u061f...","La hora del dolor puede volvernos altivos, si es que no nos quiebra: en ella, nada se ha quebrado\u2026"]')}}]);
