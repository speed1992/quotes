We say he has no business being here at all.","Our form of government does not enter into rivalry with the institutions of others. Our government does not copy our neighbors\', but is an example to them. It is true that we are called a democracy, for the administration is in the hands of the many and not of the few. But while there exists equal justice to all and alike in their private disputes, the claim of excellence is also recognized; and when a citizen is in any way distinguished, he is preferred to the public service, not as a matter of privilege, but as the reward of merit","As for poverty, no one need be ashamed to admit it, the real shame is in not taking practical measures to escape from it.","Those who can truly be accounted brave are those who best know the meaning of what is sweet in life and what is terrible, and then go out, undeterred, to meet what is to come.","Time is the wisest counselor of all.","Having knowledge but lacking the power to express it clearly is no better than never having any ideas at all.","In private matters everyone is equal before the law.

We regard wealth as something to be properly used, rather than as\\nsomething to boast about. As for poverty, no one need be ashamed to admit it, the real shame is in not taking practical measures to escape from it.","Just because you are not interested in politics, does not mean that politics is not interested in you.","We do not imitate, but are a model to others.","The marketplace is democratic.","We Athenians hold that it is not poverty that is disgraceful but the failure to struggle against it.","Remember, too, that if your country has the greatest name in all the world, it is because she never bent before disaster; because she has expended more life and effort in war than any other city, and has won for herself a power greater than any hitherto known, the memory of which will descend to the latest posterity.","Our love of what is beautiful does not lead to extravagance; our love of the things of the mind does not make us soft.","If Athens shall appear great to you, consider then that her glories were purchased by valiant men, and by men who learned their duty.","For grief is felt not so much for the want of what we have never known, as for the loss of that to which we have been long accustomed.","I am of opinion that national greatness is more for the advantage of private citizens, than any individual well-being coupled with public humiliation.

We do not regard a man who takes no interest in public affairs as harmless. We do not say that such a man \'minds his own business\'. Rather we say he has no business here at all.","Trees, though they are cut and loped, grow up again quickly, but if men are destroyed, it is not easy to get them again","For the whole earth is the tomb of famous men; not only are they commemorated by columns and inscriptions in their own country, but in foreign lands there dwells also an unwritten memorial of them, graven not on stone but in the hearts of men.","For heroes have the whole earth for their tomb; and in lands far from their own, where the column with its epitaph declares it, there is enshrined in every breast a record unwritten with no tablet to preserve it, except that of the heart."]')}}]);
