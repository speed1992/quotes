These simple things are the givens longed for by him and the other ghosts, those that would have wept to step barefoot into reality, That would have wept and been happy, have shivered in the frost And cried out to feel it again, have run fingers over leaves And against the most coiled thorn, have seized on what was ugly And laughed . . .","Perverse mankind! whose wills, created free, Charge all their woes on absolute degree; All to the dooming gods their guilt translate, And follies are miscall\'d the crimes of fate.","Many are the birds who under the sun\'s rays wander the sky; not all of them mean anything","Prophet of evil,\' he cried, \'never have you said a word to my advantage.

These conclusions have been reached through independent experiments not related to educational work in foreign countries. While sojourning in Athens I had the pleasure of visiting the best schools, both public and private, and found the reading especially spirited. I examined the books in use and found the regular reading-books to consist of the classic tales of the country, the stories of Herakles, Theseus, Perseus, and so forth, in the reader succeeding the primer, and the stories of Odysseus, or Ulysses, as we commonly call him, following as a third book, answering to our second or third reader.","The introduction to the original book as I found it in Greece contains many interesting points, since it shows that educators in foreign countries, notably in Germany, had come to the same conclusion with our best American teachers. The editor of the little Greek reading-book says: \\"In editing this work we have made use not only of Homer\'s \'Odyssey,\' but also of that excellent reader which is used in the public schools of Germany, Willman\'s \'Lesebuch aus Homer.\' We have divided the little volume into three parts, the first of which gives a short resum\xe9 of the war against Troy and the destruction of that city, the second the wanderings of Odysseus till his arrival in Ithaca, the third his arrival and the killing of the wooers. We have no apology to make in presenting this book to the public as a school-book, since many people superior to us have shown the need of such books in school-work. The new public schools, as is well known, have a mission of the highest importance. They do not aim, as formerly, at absolute knowledge pounded into the heads of children in a mechanical way. Their aim is the mental and ethical development of the pupils. Reading and writing lead but half way to this goal. With all nations the readers used in the public schools are a collection of the noblest thoughts of their authors.\\" The Greek editor had never read the inane rat and cat stories of American school \\"readers\\" when he wrote that.","He continues: \\"Happily the Greek nation, more than any other, abounds in literary masterpieces. Nearly all of the Greek writings contain an abundance of practical wisdom and virtue. Their worth is so great that even the most advanced European nations do not hesitate to introduce them into their schools. The Germans do this, although their habits and customs are so different from ours. They especially admire Homer\'s works. These books, above all others, afford pleasure to the young, and the reason for it is clearly set forth by the eminent educator Herbart: \\"\'The little boy is grieved when told that he is little. Nor does he enjoy the stories of little children. This is because his imagination reaches out and beyond his environments. I find the stories from Homer to be more suitable reading for young children than the mass of juvenile books, because they contain grand truths.\' \\"Therefore these stories are held in as high esteem by the German children as by the Greek. In no other works do children find the grand and noble traits in human life so faithfully and charmingly depicted as in Homer. Here all the domestic, civic, and religious virtues of the people are marvellously brought to light and the national feeling is exalted. The Homeric poetry, and especially the \'Odyssey,\' is adapted to very young children, not only because it satisfies so well the needs which lead to mental development, but also for another reason. As with the people of olden times bravery was considered the greatest virtue, so with boys of this age and all ages. No other ethical idea has such predominance as that of prowess. Strength of body and a firm will characterize those whom boys choose as their leaders. Hence the pleasure they derive from the accounts of celebrated heroes of yore whose bravery, courage, and prudence they admire.","With that she loosed from her breasts the breastband,pierced and alluring, with every kind of enchantmentwoven through it . . . There is the heat of Love,the pulsing rush of Longing, the lover\u2019s whisper,irresistible\u2014magic to make the sanest man go mad.","Now as these two were conversing thus with each other, a dog who was lying there raised his head and ears. This was Argos, patient-hearted Odysseus\' dog, whom he himself raised, but got no joy of him, since before that he went to sacred Ilion. In the days before, the young men had taken him 295 out to follow goats of the wild, and deer, and rabbits; but now he had been put aside, with his master absent,","Rage - Goddess, sing the rage of Peleus\' son Achilles, murderous, doomed, that cost the Achaeans countless losses, hurling down to the House of Death so many sturdy souls,great fighters\' souls, but made their bodies carrion, feasts for the dogs and birds","The editor further extols the advantages arising from the study of Homer, it making the youthful students acquainted with the earliest periods of Greek history, the manners and customs of the people, and he ends by quoting from Herbart: \\"Boys must first get acquainted with the noisy market-place of Ithaca and then be led to the Athens of Miltiades and Themistokles.\\" With equal truth the American can say that the child whose patriotism is kindled by the Homeric fire will the more gladly respond to the ideals set forth in the history of a Columbus or a Washington.

Demeter did not take part in this, she of the golden double-axe, she who glories in the harvest.5 She [Persephone] was having a good time, along with the daughters of Okeanos, who wear their girdles slung low. She was picking flowers: roses, crocus, and beautiful violets. Up and down the soft meadow. Iris blossoms too she picked, and hyacinth. And the narcissus, which was grown as a lure for the flower-faced girl by Gaia [Earth]. All according to the plans of Zeus. She [Gaia] was doing a favor for the one who receives many guests [Had\xeas].10 It [the narcissus] was a wondrous thing in its splendor. To look at it gives a sense of holy awe to the immortal gods as well as mortal humans. It has a hundred heads growing from the root up. Its sweet fragrance spread over the wide skies up above. And the earth below smiled back in all its radiance. So too the churning mass of the salty sea.15 She [Persephone] was filled with a sense of wonder, and she reached out with both hands to take hold of the pretty plaything.[2] And the earth, full of roads leading every which way, opened up under her. It happened on the Plain of Nysa. There it was that the Lord who receives many guests made his lunge. He was riding on a chariot drawn by immortal horses. The son of Kronos. The one known by many names. He seized her against her will, put her on his golden chariot,20 And drove away as she wept. She cried with a piercing voice, calling upon her father [Zeus], the son of Kronos, the highest and the best. But not one of the immortal ones, or of human mortals, heard her voice.","no es un bien la soberan\xeda de muchos; uno solo sea pr\xedncipe, uno solo rey: aqu\xe9l a quien el hijo del artero Crono ha dado cetro y leyes para que reine sobre nosotros.","It were too much toil for me, as if I were a god, to tell all this, for all about the stone wall the inhuman strength of the fire was rising,","It is the height of folly to be wise too late.","Ah how shameless\xa0\u2014the way these mortals blame the gods. \xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0From us alone, they say, come all their miseries, yes, \xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0but they themselves, with their own reckless ways, \xa040\xa0\xa0compound their pains beyond their proper share.","As they were urgent to cross a bird sign had appeared to them, an eagle, flying high and holding to the left of the people and carrying in its talons a gigantic snake, blood-colored, alive still and breathing, it had not forgotten its warcraft yet, for writhing back it struck the eagle that held it 205\xa0\xa0by chest and neck, so that the eagle let it drop groundward in pain of the bite, and dashed it down in the midst of the battle and itself, screaming high, winged away down the wind\u2019s blast. And the Trojans shivered with fear as they looked on the lithe snake lying in their midst, a portent of Zeus of the aegis.","There was no room for fear in Achilles\' heart and he sprang at the Trojans with his terrible war-cry.","Man, supposing you and I, escaping this battle, would be able to live on forever, ageless, immortal, so neither would I myself go on fighting in the foremost 325\xa0\xa0nor would I urge you into the fighting where men win glory. But now, seeing that the spirits of death stand close about us in their thousands, no man can turn aside nor escape them, let us go on and win glory for ourselves, or yield it to others.","Ah great goddess, don\u2019t be angry with me, please. All that you say is true, how well I know. Look at my wise Penelope. She falls far short of you, your beauty, stature. She is mortal after all and you, you never age or die \u2026 Nevertheless I long\u2014I pine, all my days\u2014 to travel home and see the dawn of my return. And if a god will wreck me yet again on the wine-dark sea, I can bear that too, with a spirit tempered to endure. Much have I suffered, labored long and hard by now in the waves and wars. Add this to the total\u2014 bring the trial on!","The young fool might have known his prayers were doomed to fail. Achilles was not kind or tender-hearted, but a man of fierce passions","Odysseus","El pueblo me silba, pero yo me aplaudo en mi casa mientras contemplo cari\xf1osamente las monedas en mi caja fuerte.","The son of Peleus pressed on in search of glory, bespattering his unconquerable hands with gore.","he strode among the champions in fear for the shepherd of the people, lest he be hurt, and all their labor slip away into nothing.","For few are the children who turn out to be equals of their fathers, and the greater number are worse; few are better than their father is.","the English of the nineteenth or early twentieth century is no closer to Homeric Greek than the language of today. The use of a noncolloquial or archaizing linguistic register can blind readers to the real, inevitable, and vast gap between the Greek original and any modern translation. My use of contemporary language\u2014rather than the English of a generation or two ago\u2014is meant to remind readers that this text can engage us in a direct way, and also that it is genuinely ancient.","they arise from over-saturation with the \\"Iliad.","We men are wretched things, and the gods, who have no cares themselves, have woven sorrow into the very pattern of our lives...Zeus the Thunderer has two jars standing on the floor of his palace, in which he keeps his gifts, the evils in one and the blessings in the other.","Canta, diosa, de Aquiles el Pelida ese resentimiento -\xa1que mal haya!- que infligi\xf3 a los aqueos mil dolores, y muchas almas de h\xe9roes esforzados precipit\xf3 al Hades...","For nothing is better than this more steadfast than when two people, a man and his wife, keep a harmonious household; a thing that brings much distress to the people who hate them and pleasure to their will-wishers, and for them the best reputation.","B\xeabedo, que tens a vista do c\xe3o e a coragem do veado, nunca a armadura envergaste para ir combater como os outros, nunca \xe0s ciladas te atreves, ao lado dos nobres Aquivos, que no imo peito tens medo pois sabes que a Morte te espera. Mais lucrativo, de fato, \xe9 correr todo o ex\xe9rcito Aquivo, 230 para esbulhar dos seus pr\xeamios a quem se atrever a objetar-te. Devorador do teu povo! N\xe3o fosse imprest\xe1vel, Atrida, toda esta gente, e ficara como \xfaltimo ultraje esse de hoje."]')}}]);
