I am an analyzer, trying to leave out as much as I can.","Yes, there were times when I forgot not only who I was but that I was, forgot to be.","Go on failing. Go on.

The essential is to go on squirming forever at the edge of the line, as long as there are waters and banks and ravening in heaven a sporting God to plague his creature, per pro his chosen shits.

Vladimir: Hmm. It\'d give us an erection.","We are not saints, but we have kept our appointment. How many people can boast as much?","Watt\'s concern, deep as it appeared, was not after all what the figure was, in reality, but with what the figure appeared to be, in reality.","To think, when one is no longer young, when one is not yet old, that one is no longer young, that one is not yet old, that is perhaps something.","Success and failure on the public level never mattered much to me, in fact I feel more at home with the latter, having breathed deep of its vivifying air all my writing life up to the last couple of years.","My characters have nothing. I\'m working with impotence, ignorance... that whole zone of being that has always been set aside by artists as something unusable - something by definition incompatible with art.","I did not want to write, but I had to resign myself to it in the end.","For the only way one can speak of nothing is to speak of it as though it were something, just as the only way one can speak of God is to speak of him as though he were a man, which to be sure he was, in a sense, for a time, and as the only way one can speak of man, even our anthropologists have realized that, is to speak of him as though he were a termite.","It was the only way to progress, to stop.","Deplorable mania, when something happens, to inquire what.","Silence, yes, but what silence! For it is all very fine to keep silence, but one has also to consider the kind of silence one keeps.","So all things limp together for the only possible.","It is right that he too should have his little chronicle, his memories, his reason, and be able to recognize the good in the bad, the bad in the worst, and so grow gently old down all the unchanging days, and die one day like any other day, only shorter.","There are two moments worthwhile in writing, the one when you start and the other when you throw it in the waste-paper basket.","I love order. It\'s my dream. A world where all would be silent and still, and each thing in its last place, under the last dust.","All I say cancels out, I\u2019ll have said nothing.","How long have I been here, what a question, I\'ve often wondered. And often I could answer, An hour, a month, a year, a century, depending on what I meant by here, and me, and being, and there I never went looking for extravagant meanings, there I never much varied, only the here would sometimes seem to vary.","Personally I have no bone to pick with graveyards, I take the air there willingly, perhaps more willingly than elsewhere, when take the air I must.","You are not satisfied unless form is so strictly divorced from content that you can comprehend the one without almost without bothering to read the other.","No painting is more replete than Mondrian\'s.","But I know what darkness is, it accumulates, thickens, then suddenly bursts and drowns everything.","I am such a good man, at bottom, such a good man, how is it that nobody ever noticed it?","I, of whom I know nothing, I know my eyes are open, because of the tears that pour from them unceasingly.","Hold the old holding hand. Hold and be held. Plod on and never recede. Slowly with never a pause plod on and never recede.","Suffering is the main condition of the artistic experience.","Unhappy, but not unhappy enough.","And truly it little matters what I say, this or that or any other thing. Saying is inventing. Wrong, very rightly wrong. You invent nothing, you think you are inventing, you think you are escaping, and all you do is stammer out your lesson, the remnants of a pensum one day got by heart and long forgotten, life without tears, as it is wept.","Never but the one matter. The dead and gone. The dying and going. From the word go.","I hope I am not too old to take it up seriously, nor too stupid about machines to qualify as a commercial pilot. I do not feel like spending the rest of my life writing books that no one will read. It is not as though I wanted to write them.","The reality of the individualis an incoherent reality and must be expressed incoherently.","To what will love not stoop!","Finished, it\'s finished, nearly finished, it must be nearly finished. Grain upon grain, one by one, and one day, suddenly, there\'s a heap, a little heap, the impossible heap. I can\'t be punished any more. I\'ll go now to my kitchen, ten feet by ten feet by ten feet, and wait for him to whistle me.

I fail. I try again. I fail better.","it\'s impossible I should have a mind and I have one","We could have saved sixpence. We could have saved fivepence.

There has been nothing else worthwhile... a stain upon the silence.","Love requited is a short circuit.","And all these questions I ask myself. It is not in a spirit of curiosity. I cannot be silent.

Rhetoric.","Estragon: We always find something, eh Didi, to give us the impression we exist? Vladimir: Yes, yes, we\'re magicians.","It is suicide to be abroad. But what it is to be at home, ... what it is to be at home? A lingering dissolution.","I say me, knowing all the while it\'s not me.","I open the door of the cell and go. I am so bowed I only see my feet, if I open my eyes, and between my legs a little trail of black dust. I say to myself that the earth is extinguished, though I never saw it lit.","in reality we are one and all from the unthinkable first to the no less unthinkable last glued together in a vast imbrication of flesh without breach or fissure","Yesterday is not a milestone that has been passed, but a daystone on the beaten track of the years, and irremediably part of us, within us, heavy and dangerous.

It was like difficult music heard for the first time.","My life, my life, now I speak of it as of something over, now as of a joke which still goes on, and it is neither, for at the same time it is over and it goes on, and is there any tense for\\n that? Watch wound and buried by the watchmaker, before he died, whose ruined works will one day speak of God, to the worms.","How all becomes clear and simple when one opens an eye on the within, having of course previously exposed it to the without, in order to benefit by the contrast.","Yes, I dont know why, but I have never been disappointed, and I often was in the early days, without feeling at the same time, or a moment later, an undeniable relief.","Estragon: I\'m like that.

In the madhouse of the skull and nowhere else. Where no more precautions to be taken. No precautions possible. Cooped up there with the rest. Hovel and stones. The lot. And the eye.

For each one who begins to weep somewhere else another stops. The same is true of the laugh. Let us not then speak ill of our generation, it is not any unhappier than its predecessors. Let us not speak well of it either. Let us not speak of it at all. It is true the population has increased.","The short winter\u2019s day was drawing to a close.

And we are blessed in this, that we happen to know the answer. Yes, in the immense confusion one thing alone is clear. We are waiting for Godot to come","The time is perhaps not altogether too green for the vile suggestion that art has nothing to do with clarity, does not dabble in the clear and does not make clear, and more than the light of day (or night) makes the subsolar, -lunar, and -stellar excrement.

A mug\'s game in my opinion and tiring on top of that, in the long run. But I lent myself to it with a good enough grace, knowing it was love, for she had told me so. She bent over the couch, because of her rheumatism, and in I went from behind. It was the only position she could bear, because of her lumbago. It seemed all right to me, for I had seen dogs, and I was astonished when she confided that you could go about it differently. I wonder what she meant exactly. Perhaps after all she put me in her rectum. A matter of complete indifference to me, I needn\'t tell you. But is it true love, in the rectum? That\'s what bothers me sometimes. Have I never known true love, after all? She too was an eminently flat woman and she moved with short stiff steps, leaning on an ebony stick. Perhaps she too was a man, yet another of them. But in that case surely our testicles would have collided, while we writhed. Perhaps she held hers tight in her hand, on purpose to avoid it. She favoured voluminous tempestuous shifts and petticoats and other undergarments whose names I forget. They welled up all frothing and swishing and then, congress achieved, broke over us in slow cascades. And all I could see was her taut yellow nape which every now and then I set my teeth in, forgetting I had none, such is the power of instinct. We met in a rubbish dump, unlike any other, and yet they are all alike, rubbish dumps. I don\'t know what she was doing there. I was limply poking about in the garbage saying probably, for at that age I must still have been capable of general ideas, This is life. She had no time to lose, I had nothing to lose, I would have made love with a goat, to know what love was. She had a dainty flat, no, not dainty, it made you want to lie down in a corner and never get up again. I liked it. It was full of dainty furniture, under our desperate strokes the couch moved forward on its castors, the whole place fell about our ears, it was pandemonium. Our commerce was not without tenderness, with trembling hands she cut my toe-nails and I rubbed her rump with winter cream. This idyll was of short duration. Poor Edith, I hastened her end perhaps. Anyway it was she who started it, in the rubbish dump, when she laid her hand upon my fly. More precisely, I was bent double over a heap of muck, in the hope of finding something to disgust me for ever with eating, when she, undertaking me from behind, thrust her stick between my legs and began to titillate my privates. She gave me money after each session, to me who would have consented to know love, and probe it to the bottom, without charge. But she was an idealist. I would have preferred it seems to me an orifice less arid and roomy, that would have given me a higher opinion of love it seems to me. However. Twixt finger and thumb tis heaven in comparison. But love is no doubt above such contingencies. And not when you are comfortable, but when your frantic member casts about for a rubbing-place, and the unction of a little mucous membrane, and meeting with none does not beat in retreat, but retains its tumefaction, it is then no doubt that true love comes to pass, and wings away, high above the tight fit and the loose.","Astride of a grave and a difficult birth.Down in the hole, lingeringly, the grave digger puts on the forceps.We have time to grow old.The air is full of our cries.But habit is a great deadener.At me too someone is looking, of me too someone is saying, He is sleeping, he knows nothing.Let him sleep on.","Dying for dark - the darker the worse.

What a pity I have no arms, there might still be something to be wrung from it. No, \'tis better thus. At my age, to start manstuprating again, it would be indecent. And fruitless. And yet one can never tell. With a yo heave yo, concentrating with all my might on a horse\'s rump, at the moment when the tail raises, who knows, I might not go altogether empty-handed away. Heaven, I almost felt it flutter!","I say to myself\u2014sometimes, Clov, you must learn to suffer better than that if you want them to weary of punishing you\u2014one day. I say to myself\u2014sometimes, Clov, you must be better than that if you want them to let you go\u2014one day. But I feel too old, and too far, to form new habits. Good, it\'ll never end, I\'ll never go.","Having oscillated all his life between the torments of a superficial loitering and the horrors of disinterested endeavour, he finds himself at last in a situation where to do nothing exclusively would be an act of the highest value, and significance.","For what is this shadow of the going in which we come, this shadow of the coming in which we go, this shadow of the coming and the going in which we wait, if not the shadow of purpose, of the purpose that budding withers, that withering buds, whose blooming is a budding withering.","You invent nothing, you think you are inventing, you think you are escaping, and all you do is stammer out your lesson, the remnants of a pensum one day got by heart and long forgotten, life without tears, as it is wept. To","Misfortunes, blessings, I have no time to pick my words, I am in a hurry to be done. And yet no, I am in no hurry.","But what\'s all this about not being able to die, live, be born? That must have some bearing. All this about staying where you are, dying, living, being born, unable to go forwards or back, not knowing where you came from, or where you are, or where you\'re going, or that it\'s possible to be elsewhere, to be otherwise? Supposing nothing, asking yourself nothing? You can\'t, you\'re there.","In order to be company he must display a certain mental activity. But it need not be of a high order. Indeed it might be argued the lower the better. Up to a point. The lower the order of mental activity the better the company. Up to a point.","I knew it would soon be the end, so I played the part, you know, the part of-how shall I say, I don\u2019t know.","For in me there have always been two fools, among others, one asking nothing better than to stay where he is and the other imagining that life might be slightly less horrible a little further on. So that I was never disappointed, so to speak, whatever I did, in this domain. And these inseparable fools I indulged turn about, that they might understand their foolishness.","Vladimir, be reasonable, you haven\'t yet tried everything. And I resumed the struggle.","There at least is a first affirmation, I mean negation, on which to build.","It is gone, the heart is gone, the head is gone, no one feels anything, asks anything, seeks anything, says anything, hears anything, there is only silence.","Bloom of adulthood. Try a whiff of that. On your back in the dark you remember. Ah you remember. Cloudless May day. She joins you in the little summerhouse. Entirely of logs. Both larch and fir. Six feet across. Eight from floor to vertex. Area twenty-four square feet to the furthest decimal. Two small multicoloured lights vis-a-vis. Small stained diamond panes. Under each a ledge. There on summer Sundays after his midday meal your father loved to retreat with Punch and a cushion. The waist of his trousers unbuttoned he sat on the one ledge and turned the pages. You on the other your feet dangling. When he chuckled you tried to chuckle too. When his chuckle died yours too. That you should try to imitate his chuckle pleased and amused him greatly and sometimes he would chuckle for no other reason than to hear you try to chuckle too. Sometimes you turn your head and look out through a rose-red pane. You press your little nose against the pane and all without is rosy. The years have flown and there at the same place as then you sit in the bloom of adulthood bathed in rainbow light gazing before you. She is late.","Clov: Why this farce, day after day? Hamm: Routine. One never knows. [Pause.] Last night I saw inside my breast. There was a big sore. Clov: Pah! You saw your heart. Hamm: No, it was living. [Pause. Anguished.] Clov! Clov: Yes. Hamm: What\'s happening? Clov: Something is taking its course. [Pause.] Hamm: Clov! Clov: [impatiently] What is it? Hamm: We\'re not beginning to ... to ... mean something? Clov: Mean something! You and I, mean something! [Brief laugh.] Ah that\'s a good one! Hamm: I wonder. [Pause.]","Je suis comme \xe7a. Ou j\'oublie tout de suite ou je n\'oublie jamais","All is ready. Except me. I am being given, if I may venture the expression, birth to into death, such is my impression. The feet are clear already, of the great cunt of existence. Favourable presentation I trust. My head will be the last to die. Haul in your hands. I can\'t. The render rent. My story ended I\'ll be living yet. Promising lag. That is the end of me. I shall say I no more.","My master then, assuming he is solitary, in my image, wishes me well, poor devil, wishes my good, and if he does not seem to do very much in order not to be disappointed it is because there is not very much to be done or, better still, because there is nothing to be done, otherwise he would have done it, my great and good master, that must be it, long ago, poor devil. Another supposition, he has taken the necessary steps, his will is done as far as I am concerned (for he may have other prot\xe9g\xe9s) and all is well with me without my knowing it. Cases one and two. I\u2019ll consider the former first, if I can. Then I\u2019ll admire the latter, if my eyes are still open.","Some hours later Cooper took the packet of ash from his pocket, where earlier in the evening he had put it for greater security, and threw it angrily at a man who had given him great offence. It bounced, burst, off the wall on to the floor, where at once it became the object of much dribbling, passing, trapping, shooting, punching, heading and even some recognition from the gentleman\'s code. By closing time the body, mind and soul of Murphy were freely distributed over the floor of the saloon; and before another dayspring greyened the earth had been swept away with the sand, the beer, the butts, the glass, the matches, the spits, the vomit.","It is indeed becoming more and more difficult, even senseless, for me to write an official English. And more and more my own language appears to me like a veil that must be torn apart in order to get at the things (or the Nothingness) behind it. Grammar and style. To me they have become as irrelevant as a Victorian bathing suit or the imperturbability of a true gentleman. A mask. Let us hope the time will come, thank God that in certain circles it has already come, when language is most efficiently used where it is being most efficiently misused. As we cannot eliminate language all at once, we should at least leave nothing undone that might contribute to its falling into disrepute. To bore one hole after another in it, until what lurks behind it - be it something or nothing - begins to seep through; I cannot imagine a higher goal for a writer today.","I have changed refuge so often, in the course of my rout, that now I can\'t tell between dens and ruins. But there was never any city but the one. It is true you often move along in a dream, houses and factories darken the air, trams go by and under your feet wet from the grass there are suddenly cobbles. I only know the city of my childhood, I must have seen the other, but unbelieving. All I say cancels out, I\'ll have said nothing.","Yes it sometimes happens and will sometimes happen again that I forget who I am and strut before my eyes, like a stranger. Then I see the sky different from what it is and the earth too takes on false colours. It looks like rest, it is not, I vanish happy in that alien light, which must have once been mine, I am willing to believe it, then the anguish of return, I won\u2019t say where, I can\u2019t, to absence perhaps, you must return, that\u2019s all I know, it\u2019s misery to stay, misery to go.

Who is not spared by the mad need to speak, to think, to know where one is, where one was, during the wild dream, up above, under the skies, venturing forth at night. The one ignorant of himself and silent, ignorant of his silence and silent, who could not be and gave up trying. Who crouches in their midst who see themselves in him and in their eyes stares his unchanging stare.","I don\'t like animals. It\'s a strange thing, I don\'t like men and I don\'t like animals. As for God, he is beginning to disgust me. Crouching down I would stroke his ears, through the railings, and utter wheedling words. He did not realize he disgusted me. He reared up on his hind legs and pressed his chest against the bars. Then I could see his little black penis ending in a thin wisp of wetted hair. He felt insecure, his hams trembled, his little paws fumbled for purchase, one after the other. I too wobbled, squatting my heels. With my free hand I held on to the railings. Perhaps I disgusted him too. I found it hard to tear myself away from these vain thoughts.","A bright light is not necessary, a taper is all one needs to live in strangeness, if it faithfully burns.","But all is forgotten and I have done nothing, unless what I am doing now is something, and nothing could give me greater satisfaction.","The syndrome known as life is too diffuse to admit of palliation. For every symptom that is eased, another is made worse. The horse leech\'s daughter is a closed system. Her quantum of wantum cannot vary.","When I penetrate into that house, if I ever do, it will be to go on turning, faster and faster, more and more convulsive, like a constipated dog, or one suffering from worms, overturning furniture, in the midst of my family all trying to embrace me at once, until by virtue of a supreme spasm I am catapulted in the opposite direction and gradually leave backwards, without having said good evening.","Neary\u2019s conception of friendship was very curious. He expected it to last. He never said, when speaking of an enemy: \u201cHe used to be a friend of mine, but always, with affected precision: \u201cI used to think he was a friend of mine.\u201d","So one invents obscurities. Rhetoric.","But politeness and candour run together, when one is not fitting neither is the other. Then the occasion calls for silence, that frail partition between the ill-concealed and the ill-revealed, the clumsily false and the unavoidably so.","That movements of an extreme complexity were taking place seemed certain, and yet what a simple thing it seemed, that vast yellow light sailing slowly behind my bars and which little by little the dense wall devoured, and finally eclipsed. And now its tranquil course was written on the walls, a radiance scored with shadow, then a brief quivering of leaves, if they were leaves, then that too went out, leaving me in the dark. How","My other writings are no sooner dry than they revolt me, but my epitaph still meets with my approval. There is little chance unfortunately of its ever being reared above the skull that conceived it, unless the State takes up the matter. But to be unearthed I must first be found, and I greatly fear those gentlemen will have as much trouble finding me dead as alive. So I hasten to record it here and now, while there is yet time: Hereunder lies the above who up belowSo hourly died that he lived on till now.","On. Stare on. Say on. Be on. Somehow on. Anyhow on.

May not there be another with him in the dark to and of whom the voice is speaking? Is he not perhaps overhearing a communication not intended for him? If he is alone on his back in the dark why does the voice not say so? Why does it never say for example, you saw the light on such and such a day and now you are alone on your back in the dark? Why?

It always seemed to me I died old, about ninety years old, and what years, and that my body bore it out, from head to foot. But this evening, alone in my icy bed, I have the feeling I\'ll be older than the day, the night, when the sky with all its lights fell upon me, the same I had so often gazed on since my first stumblings on the distant earth. For I\'m too frightened this evening to listen to myself rot, waiting for the great red lapses of the heart, the tear sings at the caecal walls, and for the slow killings to finish in my skull, the assaults on unshakable pillars, the fornications with corpses. So I\'ll tell myself a story, I\'ll try and tell myself another story, to try and calm myself, and it\'s there I feel I\'ll be old, old, even older than the day I fell, calling for help, and it came. Or is it possible that in this story I have come back to life, after my death?

They were pebbles but I call them stones. Yes, on this occasion I laid in a considerable store. I distributed them equally between my four pockets, and sucked them turn and turn about. This raised a problem which I first solved in the following way. I had say sixteen stones, four in each of my four pockets these being the two pockets of my trousers and the two pockets of my greatcoat. Taking a stone from the right pocket of my greatcoat, and putting it in my mouth, I replaced it in the right pocket of my greatcoat by a stone from the right pocket of my trousers, which I replaced by a stone from the left pocket of my trousers, which I replaced by a stone from the left pocket of my greatcoat, which I replaced by the stone which was in my mouth, as soon as I had finished sucking it. Thus there were still four stones in each of my four pockets, but not quite the same stones. And when the desire to suck took hold of me again, I drew again on the right pocket of my greatcoat, certain of not taking the same stone as the last time. And while I sucked it I rearranged the other stones in the way I have just described. And so on. But this solution did not satisfy me fully. For it did not escape me that, by an extraordinary hazard, the four stones circulating thus might always be the same four. In which case, far from sucking the sixteen stones turn and turn about, I was really only sucking four, always the same, turn and turn about. But I shuffled them well in my pockets, before I began to suck, and again, while I sucked, before transferring them, in the hope of obtaining a more general circulation of the stones from pocket to pocket. But this was only a makeshift that could not long content a man like me. So I began to look for something else.","No matter, no matter how, they are doing the best they can, with the miserable means at their disposal, a voice, a little light, poor devils, that\'s what they\'re paid for, they say, No sign of hardening, no sign of softening, impossible to say, no matter, it\'s a good average, we only have to continue, one day he\'ll understand, one day he\'ll thrill, the little spasm will come, a change in the eye, and cast him up among us.

The light contained the docile elements of a new manifold, the world of the body broken up into the pieces of a toy; the half light, states of peace.

And then sometimes there arose within me, confusedly, a kind of consciousness, which I express by saying, I said, etc., or don\u2019t do it Molloy, or is that your mother\u2019s name? said the sergeant, I quote from memory. Or which I express without sinking to the level of oratio recta, but by means of other figures quite as deceitful, as for example.
