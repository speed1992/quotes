It is because people know all too well what unhappiness is.","Capel said, \\"Remember that you\'re a woman.\\" All too often I forgot that.","I love luxury.

Art: an ugly thing that becomes beautiful.","In the act of deciding what to eliminate, you place value on what\'s left behind.","I invented my life because I wasn\'t pleased with it.","After a fashion, they did, mingling the sale of perfumes with anti-Nazi propaganda. In the event, my tirelessly publicised determination to wrest back control of the business neutralised most of the adverse repercussions on me from an unwilling association with their propaganda.","Material things aside, we need not advice but approval.","Winston [ Churchill] is a dandy and a visionary. Unfortunately, in winning wars, principles are inevitably debased. That\'s politics.","Fashion is everything that can pass fashionable","Passion always goes, and boredom stays.","Some people pursue unhappiness because happiness is too mild a sensation.","With four pairs of shoes I can travel the world.","The hat is not for the street: it will never be democratized. But there are certain houses that one cannot enter without a hat. And one must always wear a hat when lunching with people whom one does not know well. One appears to one\'s best advantage.","It is best to be as pretty as possible for destiny.","One can get used to ugliness, but never to negligence.","Clothes by a man who doesn\'t know women, never had one, and dreams of being one!","Nothings makes a woman look older that a rich costume.","Youth is something very new: twenty years ago no one mentioned it.","A style does not go out of style as long as it adapts itself to its period","Fashion is in the sky, in the street.","If I cut my hair, others did.

I would have killed myself.","A major shortcoming of the Resistance is the outnumbering, before long, of the genuine warriors by camera-carrying midgets intent on leaving a record of their purported heroism.","Disregarding the fact that I am old enough to be [Walter] Schellenberg\'s mother, I would feel nauseated to be coupled with a man whose ideology has debased our hearts.","I remember confuting one of Westminster\'s favourite maxims, \\"better the devil you know than the devil you don\'t\\". In the annals of popular wisdom, this is one of the most cretinous sayings I have come across.","As I now feel, I would wish to be borne off anywhere out of this world.","As a young girl, I was very proud at overcoming a reading handicap whilst other girls of my age read abundantly.","I trained myself. Long ago, `Boy\' [Arthur] Capel introduced me to \'Bludgeon the Poor!\' (Assommons les pauvres!) which, rejecting resignation, informed my moral outlook for life.","Coquetry, it\'s a triumph of the spirit over the senses.","My heart has always leaned towards England, and with the close friendship of Winston [Churchill], the hero who brought hope to the world, I could not imagine a happier life for myself.","An elegant woman should be able to do her marketing without making housewives laugh. Those who laugh are always right.","One should refrain from contempt for the baser specimens of humanity, for whom liberation amounts to shaving the heads of women who have slept with Germans.","If I say that I love you but I do want personal time, or if I don\'t want to do PDA, it\'s not that I have something against you.","That\'s what fame is: solitude.","Yves Saint Laurent is a young man of excellent taste; the more he copies me the more taste he displays.","Arrogance is in everything I do. It is in my gestures, the harshness of my voice, in the glow of my gaze, in my sinewy, tormented face.","As extended as you know most males are like young children, you understand all the things.","Good taste ruins certain true spiritual values: such as taste itself.","A style does not go out of style as long as it adapts itself to its period. When there is an incompatibility between the style and a certain state of mind, it is never the style that triumphs.","Ask me who I don\'t dress!","It\u2019s probably not just by chance that I\u2019m alone. It would be very hard for a man to live with me, unless he\u2019s terribly strong. And if he\u2019s stronger than I, I\u2019m the one who can\u2019t live with him. \u2026 I\u2019m neither smart nor stupid, but I don\u2019t think I\u2019m a run-of-the-mill person. I\u2019ve been in business without being a businesswoman, I\u2019ve loved without being a woman made only for love. The two men I\u2019ve loved, I think, will remember me, on earth or in heaven, because men always remember a woman who caused them concern and uneasiness. I\u2019ve done my best, in regard to people and to life, without precepts, but with a taste for justice.","A girl should be two things: who and what she wants.","In order to be irreplaceacle, one must always be different.","Success is most often achieved by those who don\'t know that failure is inevitable.","A woman who doesn\'t wear perfume has no future.","There is no time for cut-and-dried monotony. There is time for work. And time for love. That leaves no other time.","You can be gorgeous at thirty, charmimg at forty, and irresistible for the rest of your life.","How many cares one loses when one decides not to be something but to be someone.","I don\u2019t know why women want any of the things men have when one of the things that women have is men.","There is a time for work, and a time for love. That leaves no other time.","There is nothing more comfortable than a caterpillar and nothing more made for love than a butterfly. We need dresses that crawl and dresses that fly. Fashion is at once a captapillar and a butterfly, caterpillar by day, butterfly by night","If you\'re sad, add more lipstick and attack. Men hate women who weep.","Costume jewelry is not made to give women an aura of wealth,but to make them beautifu","Don\'t be like the rest of them, darling.","No one is young after forty, but one can be irresistible at any age","Nature gives you the face you have at twenty. Life shapes the face you have at thirty. But at fifty you get the face you deserve.","I only drink Champagne on two occasions, when I am in love and when I am not.","Dress like you are going to meet your worst enemy today.","Before you leave the house, look in the mirror and take one thing off.","No matter the age, a woman who is unloved is lost - unloved she might as well die.","He will soon be claiming that the Resistance has liberated the world.","Women hide their imperfections instead of accepting them as an added charm.","to achieve great things, we must first dream","Una Mujer de ser dos cosas: fabulosa y de lujo","The more stupid and unlucky man is, the more claims he makes to the woman.","Never a button without a buttonhole.","\xabSe nasceu sem asas, n\xe3o fa\xe7a nada para impedir que elas cres\xe7am.\xbb","\u10d2\u10d0\u10e5\u10d5\u10e1 \u10d3\u10e0\u10dd \u10db\u10e3\u10e8\u10d0\u10dd\u10d1\u10d8\u10e1\u10d7\u10d5\u10d8\u10e1,\u10d3\u10d0 \u10d2\u10d0\u10e5\u10d5\u10e1 \u10d3\u10e0\u10dd \u10e1\u10d8\u10e7\u10d5\u10d0\u10e0\u10e3\u10da\u10d8\u10e1\u10d7\u10d5\u10d8\u10e1.\u10e1\u10ee\u10d5\u10d0 \u10e0\u10d0\u10db\u10d8\u10e1\u10d7\u10d5\u10d8\u10e1 \u10d3\u10e0\u10dd \u10e3\u10d1\u10e0\u10d0\u10da\u10dd\u10d3 \u10d0\u10e0 \u10d2\u10e0\u10e9\u10d4\u10d1\u10d0.","nothing makes a woman look older than obvious expensiveness, ornateness, complicatpon","Always keep your head, heels, and standards high.-- Coco Chanel","\u0642\u062f\u0631\u064f \u0627\u0644\u0652\u0643\u0628\u0627\u0631 \u062f\u0627\u0626\u0645\u0627\u064b \u0627\u0644\u0623\u0644\u0645\u064f \u0628\u0633\u0639\u0627\u062f\u0629...(\u0627\u0644\u062a\u0636\u062d\u064a\u0629)..\u0627\u0644\u0652\u0639\u0637\u0627\u0621 \u0623\u062c\u0652\u0645\u0644\u064f \u0645\u0627 \u064a\u0645\u0652\u0644\u0643\u0648\u0646\u0652..","\xabPara ser insubstitu\xedvel, h\xe1 que ser diferente.\xbbCoco Chanel","To thyself be true;","I don\u2019t care what you think about me.
