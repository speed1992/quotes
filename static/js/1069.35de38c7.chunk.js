For anything that men can tell, death may be the greatest good that can happen to them: but they fear it as if they knew quite well that it was the greatest of evils. And what is this but that shameful ignorance of thinking that we know what we do not know?","I am quite ready to acknowledge . . . that I ought to be grieved at death, if I were not persuaded that I am going to other gods who are wise and good (of this I am as certain as I can be of any such matters), and to men departed who are better than those whom I leave behind. And therefore I do not grieve as I might have done, for I have good hope that there is yet something remaining for the dead.","To fear death is nothing other than to think oneself wise when one is not. For it is to think one knows what one does not know. No one knows whether death may not even turn out to be the greatest blessings of human beings. And yet people fear it as if they knew for certain it is the greatest evil.","The man who is truly wise knows that he knows very little.","Just as you ought not to attempt to cure eyes without head or head without body, so you should not treat body without soul.","Do you suppose that I should have lived as long as I have if I had moved in the sphere of public life, and conducting myself in that sphere like an honorable man, had always upheld the cause of right, and conscientiously set this end above all other things?

It is because that I alone, of all the Greeks, know that I know nothing.","Philebus was saying that enjoyment and pleasure and delight, and the class of feelings akin to them, are a good to every living being, whereas I contend, that not these, but wisdom and intelligence and memory, and their kindred, right opinion and true reasoning, are better and more desirable than pleasure","You think that upon the score of fore-knowledge and divining I am infinitely inferior to the swans. When they perceive approaching death they sing more merrily than before, because of the joy they have in going to the God they serve.","And the same things look bent and straight when seen in water and out of it, and also both concave and convex, due to the sight\'s being mislead by the colors, and every sort of confusion of this kind is plainly in our soul. And, then, it is because they take advantage of this affection in our nature that shadow painting, and puppeteering, and many other tricks of the kind fall nothing short of wizardry.","Since I am convinced that I wrong no one, I am not likely to wrong myself.","It is the greatest good for an individual to discuss virtue (aka aret\xe9) every day...for the unexamined life is not worth living.","Our purpose in founding the city was not to make any one class in it surpassingly happy, but to make the city as a whole as happyas possible.","I prefer to be refuted than to refute, for it is a greater good for oneself to be freed from the greatest evil than to free another.","All men\'s souls are immortal, but the souls of the righteous are immortal and divine.","YOU ARE NOT ONLY GOOD TO YOURSELF, BUT THE CAUSE OF GOODNESS IN OTHERS","I have lived long enough to learn how much there is I can really do without....

What has happened to me now has not happened of itself, but it is clear to me that it was better for me to die now and to escape from trouble. That is why my divine sign did not oppose me at any point. So I am certainly not angry with those who convicted me, or with my accusers. Of course that was not their purpose when they accused and convicted me, but they thought they were hurting me, and for this they deserve blame.","Wisdom belongs in wonder.","I soon realized that poets do not compose their poems with knowledge, but by some inborn talent and by inspiration, like seers and prophets who also say many fine things without any understanding of what they say.","To be uncertain is to be uncomfortable, but to be certain is to be ridiculous.","The true Wisdom is in recognizing our own ignorance.","...one thing I am ready to fight for as long as I can, in word and act: that is, that we shall be better, braver and more active men if we believe it right to look for what we don\'t know than if we believe there is no point in looking because what we don\'t know we can never discover.","What a lot of things there are a man can do without.","Some have courage in pleasures, and some in pains: some in desires, and some in fears, and some are cowards under the same conditions.","The beginning is the most important part, especially when dealing with anything young and tender.","An honest man is always a child.\\n[Lat., Semper bonus homo tiro est.]","God desired to be the real maker of a real bed, not a particular maker of a particular bed, and therefore He created a bed which is essentially and by nature one only.","The greatest of all mysteries is the man himself.","To know, is to know that you know nothing.","The right way to begin is to pay attention to the young, and make them just as good as possible.","If you will take my advice you will think little of Socrates, and a great deal more of truth.","Wonder is the beginning of all wisdom.","In my investigation in the service of the god I found that those who had the highest reputation were nearly the most deficient, while those who were thought to be inferior were more knowledgeable.","Neither I nor any other man should, on trial or in way, contrive to avoid death at any cost.","I only know that I know nothing","All that we know is nothing can be known.","If the whole world depends on today\'s youth, I can\'t see the world lasting another 100 years.","Virtue does not come from wealth, but wealth, and every other good thing which men have comes from virtue.","I only know how little I know","Wars and revolutions and battles are due simply and solely to the body and its desires.","The fewer our wants the more we resemble the Gods.","A painter will paint a cobbler, carpenter, or any other artist, though he knows nothing of their arts; and, if he is a good artist, he may deceive children or simple persons, when he shows them his picture of a carpenter from a distance, and they will fancy that they are looking at a real carpenter.","Creation is man\'s immortality and brings him nearest to the gods.","I have good hope that there is something remaining for the dead.","Athletics have become professionalized.","\'Wars, factions, and fighting,\' said Socrates as he looked forward from his last hour, \'have no other origin than this same body and its lusts...

It seems, to judge from the argument, that the wisdom which we desire and upon which we profess to have set our hearts will be attainable only when we are dead and not in our lifetime.","But already it is time to depart, for me to die, for you to go on living; which of us takes the better course, is concealed from anyone except God.","I only wish that ordinary people had an unlimited capacity for doing harm; then they might have an unlimited power for doing good.","I know nothing but the certainty of my own ignorance.","Whoever would have his body supple, easy and healthful should learn to dance.","If thou continuous to take delight in idle argumentation thou mayest be qualified to combat with the sophists, but will never know how to live with men.","The difficulty, my friends, is not in avoiding death, but in avoiding unrighteousness; for that runs faster than death.","Whenever a number of individuals have a common name, we assume them to have also a corresponding idea or form.","In every sort of danger there are various ways of winning through, if one is ready to do and say anything whatever.","To live well and honorably and justly are the same thing.","I only know one thing, and that is I know nothing","Are you not ashamed of your eagerness to possess as much wealth, reputation, and honors as possible, while you do not care for nor give thought to wisdom or truth, or the best possible state of your soul?","Marry a good woman, and be happy the rest of your life. Or, marry a bad, and become a good philosopher","Not by wisdom do they [poets] make what they compose, but by a gift of nature and an inspiration similar to that of the diviners and the oracles.","I know what I do not know.","If I tell you that I would be disobeying the god and on that account it is impossible for me to keep quiet, you won\'t be persuaded by me, taking it that I am ionizing.

For often in battle there is no doubt that if a man will throw away his arms, and fall on his knees before his pursuers, he may escape death; and in other dangers there are other ways of escaping death, if a man is willing to say and do anything. The difficulty, my friends, is not in avoiding death, but in avoiding unrighteousness; for that runs faster than death.","I alone know I am wise because I alone know I know nothing.","To give either to any public matter of interest or to any concern of my own, but I am in utter poverty by reason of my devotion to the god .","There are a great many of these accusers, and they have been accusing me now for a great many years, and what is more, they approached you at the most impressionable age, when some of you were children or adolescents; and literally won their case by default, because there was no one to defend me.","It was far too cold.

No one was more ignorant about the arts than I; no one was more convinced that artists possessed really beautiful secrets. However, I noticed that their condition was no better than that of the poets and that both of them have the same misconceptions. Because the most skillful among them excel in their specialty, they look upon themselves as the wisest of men. In my eyes, this presumption completely tarnished their knowledge. As a result, putting myself in the place of the oracle and asking myself what I would prefer to be \u2014 what I was or what they were, to know what they have learned or to know that I know nothing \u2014 I replied to myself and to the god: I wish to remain who I am.We do not know \u2014 neither the sophists, nor the orators, nor the artists, nor I\u2014 what the True, the Good, and the Beautiful are. But there is this difference between us: although these people know nothing, they all believe they know something; whereas, I, if I know nothing, at least have no doubts about it. As a result, all this superiority in wisdom which the oracle has attributed to me reduces itself to the single point that I am strongly convinced that I am ignorant of what I do not know.","We cannot live better than in seeking to become better.","We can easily forgive a child who is afraid of the dark; the real tragedy of life is when men are afraid of the light.","understanding a question is half an answer","Life contains but two tragedies.

I set myself to do you\u2013 each one of you, individually and in private\u2013 what I hold to be the greatest possible service.

And the care of the soul, my dear youth, has to be effected by the use of certain charms, and these charms are fair words; and by them temperance is implanted in the soul, and where temperance comes and stays, there health is speedily imparted, not only to the head, but to the whole body.","The only thing I know is that I know nothing, and i am no quite sure that i know that.","One who is injured ought not to return the injury, for on no account can it be right to do an injustice; and it is not right to return an injury, or to do evil to any man, however much we have suffered from him.","Give me beauty in the inward soul; may the outward and the inward man be at one.","There is no greater evil one can suffer than to hate reasonable discourse.","Are you not ashamed of caring so much for the making of money and for fame and prestige, when you neither think nor care about wisdom and truth and the improvement of your soul?","Well, although I do not suppose that either of us know anything really beautiful & good, I am better off than he is- for he knows nothing & thinks that he knows; I neither know nor think that I know.","To express oneself badly is not only faulty as far as the language goes, but does some harm to the soul.","Intelligent individuals learn from every thing and every one; average people, from their experiences.

And not being ambitious they do not care about honour. Wherefore necessity must be laid upon them, and they must be induced to serve from the fear of punishment. And this, as I imagine, is the reason why the forwardness to take office, instead of waiting to be compelled, has been deemed dishonourable. Now the worst part of the punishment is that he who refuses to rule is liable to be ruled by one who is worse than himself. And the fear of this, as I conceive, induces the good to take office, not because they would, but because they cannot help \u2014 not under the idea that they are going to have any benefit or enjoyment themselves, but as a necessity, and because they are not able to commit the task of ruling to any one who is better than themselves, or indeed as good. For there is reason to think that if a city were composed entirely of good men, then to avoid office would be as much an object of contention as to obtain office is at present\u2026","The ancient Oracle said that I was the wisest of all the Greeks.

One must accept the fall of the dice and settle one\'s affairs accordingly-- in whatever way argument declares would be best. One must not behave like children who have stumbled and who hold on to the hurt place and spend their time in crying out; rather one must always habituate the soul to turn as quickly as possible to curing and setting aright what has fallen and is sick, doing away with lament by medicine.","Neither in war nor yet at law ought any man to use every way of escaping death. For often in battle there is no doubt that if a man will throw away his arms, and fall on his knees before his pursuers, he may escape death; and in other dangers there are other ways of escaping death, if a man is willing to say and do anything. The difficulty, my friends, is not in avoiding death, but in avoiding unrighteousness; for that runs faster than death.","How many things can I do without?","And a thing is not seen because it is visible, but\\tconversely, visible because it is seen; nor is a thing led because\\tit is in the state of being led, or carried because it is in the\\tstate of being carried, but the converse of this.

Is there not here conceit of knowledge, which is a disgraceful sort of ignorance? And this is the point in which, as I think, I am superior to men in general, and in which I might perhaps fancy myself wiser than other men, - that whereas I know but little of the world below, I do not suppose that I know: but I do know that injustice and disobedience to a better, whether God or man, is evil and dishonorable, and I will never fear or avoid a possible good rather than a certain evil.","As for me, all I know is that I know nothing.","I thought that as I had failed in the contemplation of true existence, I ought to be careful that I did not lose the eye of my soul; as people may injure their bodily eye by observing and gazing on the sun during an eclipse, unless they take the precaution of looking at the image reflected in the water, or in some similar medium. ...I was afraid that my soul might be blinded altogether if I looked at things with my eyes or tried by the help of my senses to apprehend them. And I thought that I had better had recourse to ideas, and seek in them truth in existence. I dare to say that the simile is not perfect--for I am far from admitting that he who contemplates existence through the medium of ideas, sees them only \\"through a glass darkly,\\" any more than he who sees them in their working and effects.","I pity those reviewers above, and people like them, who ridicule authors like R.A. Boulay and other proponents of similar Ancient Astronaut theories, simply for putting forth so many interesting questions (because that\'s really what he often throughout openly admits is all he does does) in light of fascinating and thought-provoking references which are all from copious sources.Some people will perhaps only read the cover and introduction and dismiss it as soon as any little bit of information flies in the face of their beliefs or normalcy biases. Some of those people, I\'m sure, are some of the ones who reviewed this book so negatively without any constructive criticism or plausible rebuttal. It\'s sad to see how programmed and indoctrinated the vast majority of humanity has become to the ills of dogma, indoctrination, unverified status quos and basic ignorance; not to mention the laziness and conformity that results in such acquiescence and lack of critical thinking or lack of information gathering to confirm or debunk something. Too many people just take what\'s spoon fed to them all their lives and settle for it unquestioningly. For those people I like to offer a great Einstein quote and one of my personal favorites and that is:\\"Condemnation without investigation is the highest form of ignorance\\"I found this book to be a very interesting gathering of information and collection of obscure and/or remote antiquated information, i.e. biblical, sacred, mythological and otherwise, that we were not exactly taught to us in bible school, or any other public school for that matter. And I am of the school of thought that has been so for intended purposes.The author clearly cites all his fascinating sources and cross-references them rather plausibly. He organizes the information in a sequential manner that piques ones interest even as he jumps from one set of information to the next. The information, although eclectic as it spans from different cultures and time periods, interestingly ties together in several respects and it is this synchronicity that makes the information all the more remarkable.For those of you who continue to seek truth and enlightenment because you understand that an open mind makes for and lifelong pursuit of such things I leave you with these Socrates quotes:\\"True wisdom comes to each of us when we realize how little we understand about life, ourselves, and the world around us.","True wisdom comes to each of us when we realize how little we understand about life, ourselves, & the world around us.","the great honor in the world is to be what we pretend to be","Conocerse a uno mismo, ese es el principio fundamental de la verdadera sabidur\xeda Humana.","...each individual can only do one thing well.

Are you not ashamed of this?","Would that the majority could inflict the greatest evils, for they would then be capable of the greatest good, and that would be fine, but now they cannot do either.

Thus there is a vast chain of dancers and masters and undermasters of choruses, who are suspended, as if from the stone, at the side of the rings which hang down from the Muse. And every poet has some Muse from whom he is suspended, and by whom he is said to be possessed, which is nearly the \\tIon 5same thing; for he is taken hold of.","I neither know nor think that I know","...[T]he really important thing is not to live, but to live well...

It is to fulfill some such function that I believe the god has placed me in the city. I never cease to rouse each and every one of you, to persuade and reproach youall day long and everywhere I find myself in your company.","Knowledge will make you be free.","You are wrong sir, if you think that a man who is any good at all should take into account the risk of life or death; he should look to this only in his actions, whether what he does is right or wrong.","To know, is to know that you know nothing. That is the meaning of true knowledge.","There is one way, then, in which a man can be free from all anxiety about the fate of his soul - if in life he has abandoned bodily pleasures and adornments, as foreign to his purpose and likely to do more harm than good, and has devoted himself to the pleasures of acquiring knowledge, and so by decking his soul not with a borrowed beauty but with its own - with self-control, and goodness, and courage, and liberality, and truth - has fitted himself to await his journey in the next world.","By all means, marry. If you get a good wife, you\u2019ll become happy; if you get a bad one, you\u2019ll become a philosopher.","I\'m wiser than that person.

And is not all true virtue the companion of wisdom, no matter what fears or pleasures or other similar goods or evils may or may not attend her? But the virtue which is made up of these goods, when they are severed from wisdom and exchanged with one another, is a shadow of virtue only, nor is there any freedom or health or truth in her; but in the true exchange there is a purging away of all these things, and temperance, and justice, and courage, and wisdom herself, are a purgation of them.","The definition of terms is the beginning of wisdom.","It is better to suffer wrong than to do wrong","...a good man cannot be harmed either in life or in death, and that his affairs are not neglected by the gods.","By all means marry.

I shall do this to everyone that I meet, young or old, foreigner or fellow-citizen; but especially to you my fellow-citizens, inasmuch as you are closer to me in kinship. This, I do assure you, is what my God commands; and it is my belief that no greater good has ever befallen you in this city than my service to my God; for I spend all my time going about trying to persuade you, young and old, to make your first and chief concern not for your bodies nor for your possessions, but for the highest welfare of your souls, proclaiming as I go \'Wealth does not bring goodness, but goodness brings wealth and every other blessing, both to the individual and to the State.\' ...And so, gentlemen, I would say, \'You can please yourselves whether you listen to Anytus or not, and whether you acquit me or not; you know that I am not going to alter my conduct, not even if I have to die a hundred deaths.","Human nature will not easily find a better helper than eros","..Do we have not choice but to agree that in each of us are found the same elements and characteristics as are found in the city?

If death were a release from everything, it would be a boon for the wicked. But since the soul is clearly immortal, it can have no escape or security from evil except by becoming as good and wise as it possibly can. For it takes nothing with it to the next world except its education and training: and these, we are told, are of supreme importance in helping or harming the newly dead at the very beginning of his journey there.","So I withdrew and thought to myself: \'I am wiser than this man; it is likely that neither of us knows anything worthwhile, but he thinks he knows something when he does not, whereas when I do not know, neither do I think I know; so I am likely to be wiser than he to this small extent, that I do not think I know what I do not know.","I am likely to be wiser than he to this small, extent, that I do not think I know what I do not know","Two things greater than all the things are.On is love and the other is war.","I am likely to be wiser than he to this small, extent, that I do not think I know what I do not know.","A man who preserves his integrity no real, long-lasting harm can ever come.","He who is not content with what he has will not be content with what he would like to have.","Is something good because the gods approve of it?

Now if you suppose that there is no consciousness, but a sleep like the sleep of him who is undisturbed even by dreams, death will be an unspeakable gain. For if a person were to select the night in which his sleep was undisturbed even by dreams, and were to compare with this the other days and nights of his life, and then were to tell us how many days and nights he had passed in the course of his life better and more pleasantly than this one, I think that any man, I will not say a private man, but even the great king will not find many such days or nights, when compared with the others. Now if death be of such a nature, I say that to die is gain; for eternity is then only a single night. But if death is the journey to another place, and there, as men say, all the dead abide, what good, O my friends and judges, can be greater than this? If indeed when the pilgrim arrives in the world below, he is delivered from the professors of justice in this world, and finds the true judges who are said to give judgment there, Minos and Rhadamanthus and Aeacus and Triptolemus, and other sons of God who were righteous in their own life, that pilgrimage will be worth making. What would not a man give if he might converse with Orpheus and Musaeus and Hesiod and Homer? Nay, if this be true, let me die again and again.","Virtue is not given by money, but that from virtue comes money and every other good of man, public as well as private.","Anyone who\u2019s really fighting for justice must live as a private citizen and not as a public figure if he\u2019s going to survive even a short time.","God only is wise.","\u1f41 ... \u1f00\u03bd\u03b5\u03be\u03ad\u03c4\u03b1\u03c3\u03c4\u03bf\u03c2 \u03b2\u03af\u03bf\u03c2 \u03bf\u1f50 \u03b2\u03b9\u03c9\u03c4\u1f78\u03c2 \u1f00\u03bd\u03b8\u03c1\u03ce\u03c0\u1ff3...

No doubt my accuser might put me to death or have me banished or deprived of civic rights; but even if he thinks, as he probably does (and others to, I dare say), that these are great calamities, I do not think so... For let me tell you, gentlemen, that to be afraid of death is only another form of thinking that one is wise when one is not; it is to think that one knows what one does not know. No one knows with regard to death whether it is not really the greatest blessing that can happen to a man; but people dread it as though they were certain that it is the greatest evil; and this ignorance, which thinks that it knows what it does not, must surely be ignorance most culpable. This, I take it, gentlemen, is the degree, and this is the nature of my advantage over the rest of mankind; and if I were to claim to be wiser than my neighbour in any respect, it would be in this: that not possessing any real knowledge of what comes after death, I am also conscious that I do not possess it. But I do know that to do wrong and to disobey my superior, whether God or man, is wicked and dishonourable; and so I shall never feel more fear or aversion for something which, for all I know, may really be a blessing, than for those evils which I know to be evils.","Make Athens Think Again.","...I do not think that it is right for a man to appeal to the jury or to get himself acquitted by doing so; he ought to inform them of the facts and convince them by argument.

Then when I began to try to show him that he only thought he was wise and was not really so, my efforts were resented both by him and by many of the other people present. However, I reflected as I walked away: \'Well, I am certainly wiser than this man. It is only too likely that neither of us has any knowledge to boast of; but he thinks that he knows something which he does not know, whereas I am quite conscious of my ignorance.

There is no greater evil one can suffer than to hate reasonablediscourse. Misology and misanthropy arise in the same way. Misanthropy comes when a man without knowledge or skill has placed greattrust in someone and believes him to be altogether truthful, sound, andtrustworthy; then, a short time afterwards he finds him to be wickedand unreliable, and then this happens in another case; when one hasfrequently had that experience, especially with those whom one believed eto be one\u2019s closest friends, then, in the end, after many such blows,one comes to hate all men and to believe that no one is sound in anyway at all.","Well, although I do not suppose that either of us knows anything really beautiful and good, I am better off than he is, \u2014 for he knows nothing, and thinks that he knows; I neither know nor think that I know.","The triumph of my art is in thoroughly examining whether the thought which the mind of the young man brings forth is a false idol or a noble true birth.","Those who are the hardest to love are the ones who need it most."]')}}]);
