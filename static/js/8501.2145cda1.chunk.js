And the day came when the risk it took to stay tight inside the bud was more painful than the risk it took to blossom.","Life shrinks or expands in proportion to one\'s courage.","My mission, should I choose to accept it, is to find peace with exactly who and what I am. To take pride in my thoughts, my appearance, my talents, my flaws and to stop this incessant worrying that I can\u2019t be loved as I am.","Don\'t let one cloud obliterate the whole sky.","I walk ahead of myself in perpetual expectancy of miracles.","I want to love you wildly. I don\u2019t want words, but inarticulate cries, meaningless, from the bottom of my most primitive being, that flow from my belly like honey. A piercing joy, that leaves me empty, conquered, silenced.","And the day came when the risk to remain tight in a bud was more painful than the risk it took to blossom.","You cannot save people. You can only love them.","No one should be forced to carry the unfulfilled self of another.","When you possess light within, you see it externally.","Anything I can not transform into something marvelous, I let go.","Whenever you do something that is not aligned with the yearning or your soul\u2014you create suffering.","I must be a mermaid, Rango. I have no fear of depths and a great fear of shallow living.","Do not seek the because - in love there is no because, no reason, no explanation, no solutions.","Pain is something to master, not to wallow in.","Reality doesn\u2019t impress me. I only believe in intoxication, in ecstasy, and when ordinary life shackles me. I escape, one way or another. No more walls.","Throw your dreams into space like a kite, and you do not know what it will bring back, a new life, a new friend, a new love, a new country.","Tranquillity is contagious, peace is contagious. One only thinks of the contagiousness of illness, but there is the contagion of serenity and joy.","We are never trapped unless we choose to be.","My life is not possible to tell. I change every day, change my patterns, my concepts, my interpretations. I am a series of moods and sensations. I play a thousand roles. I weep when I find others play them for me. My real self is unknown. My work is merely an essence of this vast and deep adventure.","\\"We see the world as \'we\' are, not as \'it\' is; because it is the \\"I\\" behind the \'eye\' that does the seeing.\\"","The secret of life was Breath. That was what I always wanted my words to do, to Breathe.","When your beauty struck me, it dissolved me. Deep down, I am not different from you. I dreamed you, I wished for your existence. I see in you that part of me which is you. I surrender my sincerity because if I love you it means we share the same fantasies, we share the same madness.","What we call our destiny is truly our character and that character can be altered. The knowledge that we are responsible for our actions and attitudes does not need to be discouraging, because it also means that we are free to change this destiny. One is not in bondage to the past, which has shaped our feelings, to race, inheritance, background. All this can be altered if we have the courage to examine how it formed us. We can alter the chemistry provided we have the courage to dissect the elements.","I don\u2019t really want to become normal, average, standard. I want merely to gain in strength, in the courage to live out my life more fully, enjoy more, experience more. I want to develop even more original and more unconventional traits","I take pleasure in my transformations. I look quiet and consistent, but few know how many women there are in me.","I\u2019m restless. Things are calling me away. My hair is being pulled by the stars again.","You have a right to experiment with your life. You will make mistakes. And they are right too.","If I love you it means we share the same fantasies, the same madnesses","I love the abstract, delicate, profound, vague, voluptuously wordless sensation of living ecstatically.","We do not grow absolutely, chronologically. We grow sometimes in one dimension, and not in another, unevenly. We grow partially. We are relative. We are mature in one realm, childish in another. The past, present, and future mingle and pull us backward, forward, or fix us in the present. We are made of layers, cells, constellations.","I want to do things so wild with you that I don\'t know how to say them.","The dream was always running ahead of me. To catch up, to live for a moment in unison with it, that was the miracle.","Each friend represents a world in us, a world not born until they arrive, and it is only by this meeting that a new world is born.","Love never dies a natural death. It dies because we don\'t know how to replenish its source.","How wrong it is for a woman to expect the man to build the world she wants, rather than to create it herself.","From the backstabbing co-worker to the meddling sister-in-law, you are in charge of how you react to the people and events in your life. You can either give negativity power over your life or you can choose happiness instead. Take control and choose to focus on what is important in your life. Those who cannot live fully often become destroyers of life.","There are many ways to be free. One of them is to transcend reality by imagination, as I try to do.","You live out the confusions until they become clear.","I will not adjust myself to the world. I am adjusted to myself.","For you and for me the highest moment, the keenest joy, is not when our minds dominate but when we lose our minds, and you and I both lose it in the same way, through love.","What everyone forgets is that passion is not merely a heightened sensual fusion but a way of life which produces, as in the mystics, an ecstatic awareness of the whole of life.","I am an excitable person who only understands life lyrically, musically, in whom feelings are much stronger as reason. I am so thirsty for the marvelous that only the marvelous has power over me. Anything I can not transform into something marvelous, I let go. Reality doesn\'t impress me. I only believe in intoxication, in ecstasy, and when ordinary life shackles me, I escape, one way or another. No more walls.","In chaos, there is fertility.","When we blindly adopt a religion, a political system, a literary dogma, we become automatons. We cease to grow.","The only transformer and alchemist that turns everything into gold is love. The only magic against death, aging, ordinary life, is love.","We have been poisoned by fairy tales.","willingness to explore everything is a sign of strength. The weak ones have prejudices. Prejudices are a protection.","I, with a deeper instinct, choose a man who compels my strength, who makes enormous demands on me, who does not doubt my courage or my toughness, who does not believe me naive or innocent, who has the courage to treat me like a woman.","The real wonders of life lie in the depths. Exploring the depths for truths is the real wonder which the child and the artist know: magic and power lie in truth.","Violence is a symptom of impotence.","Experience teaches acceptance of the imperfect as life.","it was while helping others to be free that I gained my own freedom.","I only believe in fire. Life. Fire. Being myself on fire I set others on fire. Never death. Fire and life.","Age does not protect you from love. But love, to some extent, protects you from age.","The secret of joy is the mastery of pain.","I love your silences, they are like mine.","I believe the lasting revolution comes from deep changes in ourselves which influence our collective life.","Each contact with a human being is so rare, so precious, one should preserve it.","Life is a process of becoming, a combination of states we have to go through. Where people fail is that they wish to elect a state and remain in it. This is a kind of death.","Shame is the lie someone told you about yourself.","You are the poet, you walk inside my dreams.","You are the only woman who ever answered the demands of my imagination.","People living deeply have no fear of death.","We do not see the world as it is. We see the word as we are.","Introspection is a devouring monster.","I am a winged creature who is too rarely allowed to use its wings. Ecstasies do not occur often enough.","Create a world, your world. Alone. Stand alone. And then love will come to you, then it comes to you.","To change skins, evolve into new cycles, I feel one has to learn to discard.  If one changes internally one should not continue to live with the same objects.  They reflect one\'s mind and psyche of yesterday.  I throw away what has no dynamic, living use.","I adore the struggle you carry in yourself. I adore your terrifying sincerity.","We don\'t have a language for the senses. Feelings are images, sensations are like musical sounds.","The risk it takes to remain tight inside the bud\\nis more painful than the risk it takes to blossom.\\nWe don\'t see things as they are, we see them as we are.","We are all engaged in the task of peeling off the false selves, the programmed selves, the selves created by our families, our culture, our religions. It is an enormous task because the history of women has been as incompletely told as the history of blacks.","Compassion for our parents is the true sign of maturity.","Living never wore one out so much as the effort not to live.","Mature people relate to each other without the need to merge.","Poetry is the alchemy which teaches us to convert ordinary materials into gold.","Good things happen to those who hustle.","Your eyes make me shy","I don\'t wish power, only art -art and passion.","We write to taste life twice, in the moment, and in retrospection.","Things aren\'t the way they are, they\'re the way you are","With her eyes alone she could give this response, this absolutely erotic response, as if febrile waves were trembling there, pools of madness... something devouring that could lick a man all over like a flame, annihilate him, with a pleasure never known before.","Had I not created my whole world, I would certainly have died in other people\u2019s.","Balance is not to be sought by association with others; it must exist within one\'s self.","You can either give negativity power over your life or you can choose happiness instead.","You fall in love with people\'s minds.","You don\'t find love, it finds you. It\'s got a little bit to do with destiny, fate, and what\'s written in the stars.","I postpone death by living, by suffering, by error, by risking, by giving, by losing.","When I am most deeply rooted, I feel the wildest desire to uproot myself.","The only abnormality is the incapacity to love.","The suppression of inner patterns in favor of patterns created by society is dangerous to us.","The theme of the diary is always the personal, but it does not mean only a personal story: it means a personal relationship to all things and people. The personal, if it is deep enough, becomes universal, mythical, symbolic; I never generalize, intellectualise. I see, I hear, I feel. These are my primitive elements of discovery. Music, dance, poetry and painting are the channels for emotion. It is through them that experience penetrates our bloodstream.","Music melts all the separate parts of our bodies together.","I want to live darkly and richly in my femaleness.","Nature forms us for ourselves, not for others; to be, not to seem.","Because history is only an aggregate of personal hostilities, personal prejudices, personal blindness and irrationality, there are times when we have to live against it.","Life is truly known only to those who suffer, lose, endure adversity and stumble from defeat to defeat.","The value of the personal relationship to all things is that it creates intimacy and intimacy creates understanding and understanding creates love.","Life is a full circle, widening until it joins the circle motions of the infinite.","Sometimes we reveal ourselves when we are least like ourselves.","When you make a world tolerable for yourself, you make a world tolerable for others.","I don\'t tell the truth any more to those who can\'t make use of it. I tell it mostly to myself, because it always changes me.","It is a sign of great inner insecurity to be hostile to the unfamiliar.","The personal life deeply lived always expands into truths beyond itself.","Dreams are necessary to life.","The role of a writer is not to say what we all can say, but what we are unable to say.","We are like sculptors, constantly carving out of others the image we long for, need, love or desire, often against reality, against their benefit, and always, in the end, a disappointment, because it does not fit them.","It is in the movements of emotional crisis that human beings reveal themselves most accurately.","Love men and women not for their strength but their softness, not for their fullness but their hunger, not for their plenty but their need.","I needed to live, but I also needed to record what I lived.","Passion gives me moments of wholeness.","Life is what we make it, always has been, always will be...including our perception. Of it","myself ... is merely an instrument to connect life and a myth","She lacks confidence, she craves admiration insatiably. She lives on the reflections of herself in the eyes of others. She does not dare to be herself.","You must not fear, hold back, count or be a miser with your thoughts and feelings. It is also true that creation comes from an overflow, so you have to learn to intake, to imbibe, to nourish yourself and not be afraid of fullness. The fullness is like a tidal wave which then carries you, sweeps you into experience and into writing.","The source of sexual power is curiosity, passion. You are watching its little flame die of asphyxiation. Sex does not thrive on monotony. Without feeling, inventions, moods, no surprises in bed. Sex must be mixed with tears, laughter, words, promises, scenes, jealousy, envy, all of the spices of fear, foreign travel, new faces, novels, stories, dreams, fantasies, music, dancing, opium, wine.","I either eat too much or starve myself. Sleep for 14 hours or have insomniac nights. Fall in love very hard or hate passionately. I don\'t know what grey is. I never did.","I am an excitable person who only understands life lyrically, musically, in whom feelings are much stronger as reason.","I reserve the right to love many different people at once, and to change my prince often.","There are two ways to reach me: by way of kisses or by way of the imagination. But there is a hierarchy: the kisses alone don\'t work.","I find that life, day by day, is composed of at least one joy, one problem and one sorrow. Then there are the smaller ingredients: you always learn something, whether useful or harmful - that is difficult to analyze until later; you always give something; you alwayou always grow a little in one direction or another.","The artist is the only one who knows that the world is a subjective creation, that there is a choice to be made, a selection of elements.","Those who cannot live fully often become destroyers of life.","We cannot cure the evils of politics with politics.","I believe one writes because one has to create a world in which one can live.","There are only two kinds of freedom in the world; the freedom of the rich and powerful, and the freedom of the artist and the monk who renounces possessions.","The child who is uprooted begins to recognize that what he builds within himself is what will endure, what will withstand shattering experiences.","We are beginning to see the influence of dream upon reality and reality upon dream.","There is a fissure in my vision and madness will always rush through.","The imagination is far better at inventing tortures than life because the imagination is a demon within us and it knows where to strike, where it hurts. It knows the vulnerable spot, and life does not, our friends and lovers do not, because seldom do they have the imagination equal to the task.","What is love but acceptance of the other, whatever he is.","Everything but happiness is neurosis.","All unlived emotions turn to inanity.","I walked into my own book, seeking peace. It was night, and I made a careless movement inside the dream; I turned too brusquely the corner and I bruised myself against my madness.","I made no resolutions for the New Year. The habit of making plans, of criticizing, sanctioning and molding my life, is too much of a daily event for me.","We travel, some of us forever, to seek other states, other lives, other souls.","The enemy of a love is never outside, it\'s not a man or woman, it\'s what we lack in ourselves.","We see things the way we are, not the way they are.","The source of sexual power is curiosity, passion. You are watching its little flame die of asphyxiation.","A war regarded as inevitable or even probable, and therefore much prepared for, has a very good chance of eventually being fought.","The possession of knowledge does not kill the sense of wonder and mystery. There is always more mystery.","Jazz is the music of the body.","I hate men who are afraid of women\'s strength.","Life is so fluid that one can only hope to capture the living moment, to capture it alive and fresh ... without destroying that moment.","The self is merely the lens through which we see others and the world.","The obstacle became his alibi for weakness.","Luxury is not a necessity to me, but beautiful and good things are.","I disregard the proportions, the measures, the tempo of the ordinary world. I refuse to live in the ordinary world as ordinary women. To enter ordinary relationships. I want ecstasy. I am a neurotic \u2014 in the sense that I live in my world. I will not adjust myself to the world. I am adjusted to myself.","I don\'t hear your words: your voice reverberates against my body like another kind of caress, another kind of penetration. I have no power over your voice. It comes straight from you into me. I could stuff my ears and it would find its way into my blood and make it rise.","When others asked the truth of me, I was convinced it was not the truth they wanted, but an illusion they could bear to live with.","There is not one big cosmic meaning for all, there is only the meaning we each give to our life, an individual meaning, an individual plot, like an individual novel, a book for each person.","We love best those who are, or act for us, a self we do not wish to be or act out.","The Frenchman, by nature, is sensuous and sensitive. He has intelligence, which makes him tired of life sooner than other kinds of men. He is not athletic: he sees the futility of the pursuit of fame; the climate at times depresses him.","Life is a process of becoming, a combination of states we have to go through.","I don\'t mind working, holding my ground intellectually, artistically; but as a woman, oh, God, as a woman I want to be dominated","We are cruel when someone refuses to play the role in which we have cast him. We judge a person only according to his relationship towards us.","My life is slowed up by thought and the need to understand what I am living.","I was stirred only like a leaf in the wind, that is all. . .","The unknown was my compass. The unknown was my encyclopedia. The unnamed was my science and progress.","Nothing too long imagined can be perfect in a wordly way.","The earth is heavy and opaque without dreams.","Our life is composed greatly from dreams, from the unconscious, and they must be brought into connection with action. They must be woven together.","Ordinary life does not interest me.","Sometimes I think of Paris not as a city but as a home.","Eroticism is one of the basic means of self-knowledge, as indispensable as poetry.","I am apparently gentle, unstable, and full of pretenses.  I will die a poet killed by the nonpoets, will renounce no dream, resign myself to no ugliness, accept nothing of the world but the one I made myself.  I wrote, lived, loved like Don Quixote, and on the day of my death I will say: \u2018Excuse me, it was all a dream,\u2019 and by that time I may have found one who will say: \u2018Not at all, it was true, absolutely true.\u2019","Don\'t say anything, because I see that you understand me, and I am afraid of your understanding. I have such a fear of finding another like myself, and such a desire to find one! I am so utterly lonely, but I also have such a fear that my isolation be broken through, and I no longer be the head and ruler of my universe. I am in great terror of your understanding by which you penetrate into my world; and then I stand revealed and I have to share my kingdom with you.","I can elect something I love and absorb myself in it.","The fiery moments of passionate experience are the moments of wholeness and totality of the personality.","Human beings can reach such desperate solitude that they may cross a boundary beyond which words cannot serve, and at such moments there is nothing left for them but to bark.","It is possible I never learned the names of birds in order to discover the bird of peace, the bird of paradise, the bird of the soul, the bird of desire. It is possible I avoided learning the names of composers and their music the better to close my eyes and listen to the mystery of all music as an ocean. It may be I have not learned dates in history in order to reach the essence of timelessness. It may be I never learned geography the better to map my own routes and discover my own lands. The unknown was my compass. The unknown was my encyclopedia. The unnamed was my science and progress.","Stories are the only enchantment possible, for when we begin to see our suffering as a story, we are saved.","Convalescence. Such an utter weakness that you lie like an animal hibernating, playing possum. You float. You are adrift. Every current is stronger than you.","There were always in me, two women at least, one woman desperate and bewildered, who felt she was drowning and another who would leap into a scene, as upon a stage, conceal her true emotions because they were weaknesses, helplessness, despair, and present to the world only a smile, an eagerness, curiosity, enthusiasm, interest.","The inner chambers of the soul are like the photographer\'s darkroom. Like a laboratory. One cannot stay there all the time or it becomes the solitary cell of the neurotic.","One handles truths like dynamite.","Where the myth fails, human love begins. Then we love a human being, not our dream, but a human being with flaws.","Write. Write until it stops hurting.","Nowhere is inhumanity more revealed than in hospitals.","Art is the method of levitation, in order to separate one\'s self from enslavement by the earth.","The two men who have done the greatest harm to the world are Christ and Columbus. Christ taught us guilt and sacrifice, to live only in the other world, and Columbus discovered America and materialism.","Love never dies a natural death. It dies because we don\'t know how to replenish its source. It dies of blindness and errors and betrayals. It dies of illness and wounds; it dies of weariness, of witherings, of tarnishings.","Woman does not forget she needs the fecundator, she does not forget that everything that is born of her is planted in her.","Only the united beat of sex and heart together can create ecstasy.","My ideas usually come not at my desk writing but in the midst of living.","Expressing feelings is linked directly with creation... In this ability to tap the sources of feeling and imagination lies the secret of abundance.","The creative personality never remains fixed on the first world it discovers. It never resigns itself to anything.","It is the function of art to renew our perception. What we are familiar with we cease to see. The writer shakes up the familiar scene, and, as if by magic, we see a new meaning in it.","I have this weird obsession about buying books and looking at them with a smile, even if I won\'t read them soon. At least they are mine now.","That is my essential reason for writing, not for fame, not to be celebrated after death, but to heighten and create life all around me. I also write because when I am writing I reach the high moment of fusion sought by the mystics, the poets, the lovers, a sense of communion with the universe.","I will always be the virgin-prostitute, the perverse angel, the two-faced sinister and saintly woman.","I want to hear raucous music, to see faces, to brush against bodies, to drink fiery Benedictine. Beautiful women and handsome men arouse fierce desires in me. I want to dance. I want drugs. I want to know perverse people, to be intimate with them. I never look at naive faces. I want to bite into life, and to be torn by it.","I\'m awaiting a lover. I have to be rent and pulled apart and live according to the demons and the imagination in me. I\'m restless. Things are calling me away. My hair is being pulled by the stars again.","At a lecture I am asked to pronounce my name three times. I try to be slow and emphatic, \\"Ana\xefs - Ana\xefs - Ana\xefs. You just say \\"Anna\\" and then add \\"ees,\\" with the accent on the \\"ees.\\"","You live like this, sheltered, in a delicate world, and you believe you are living.","If I fall asleep, it is because I am overloaded. I sleep because one hour with Henry contains five years of my life, and one phrase, one caress answers the expectations of a hundred nights. When I hear him laugh, I say, \\"I have heard Rabelais.\\". And I swallow his laughter like bread and wine.","If you do not breathe through writing, if you do not cry out in writing, or sing in writing, then don\'t write, because our culture has no use for it.","No one was ever born without that light or flame of life. Some event, some person stifles or drowns it altogether. I was always tempted to resuscitate such men by my own joyousness or luminosity.When I break glasses in a night club, as the Russians do, when my unconscious breaks out in wild rebellions, it is against life which has crippled these idealistic, romantic men. I respect these men, cold, pure, faithful, devoted, moral, delicate, sensitive, and unequal to life, more than I respect the tough-minded ones who return three blows to one received, who kill those who hurt them.","Ordinary life does not interest me. I seek only the high moments. I am in accord with the surrealists, searching for the marvelous. I want to be a writer who reminds others that these moments exist; I want to prove that there is infinite space, infinite meaning, infinite dimension. But I am not always in what I call a state of grace. I have days of illuminations and fevers. I have days when the music in my head stops. Then I mend socks, prune trees, can fruits, polish furniture. But while I am doing this I feel I am not living.","All of my creation is an effort to weave a web of connection with the world: I am always weaving it because it was once broken.","Each friend represents a world in us.","There are books which we read early in life, which sink into our consciousness and seem to disappear without leaving a trace. And then one day we find, in some summing-up of our life and put attitudes towards experience, that their influence has been enormous.","I sleep with my feet on moss carpets, my branches in the cotton of the clouds.","In the world of the dreamer there was solitude: all the exaltations and joys came in the moment of preparation for living. They took place in solitude. But with action came anxiety, and the sense of insuperable effort made to match the dream, and with it came weariness, discouragement, and the flight into solitude again. And then in solitude, in the opium den of remembrance, the possibility of pleasure again.","We also write to heighten our own awareness of life... We write to taste life twice, in the moment, and in retrospection... We write to be able to transcend our life, to reach beyond it...to teach ourselves to speak with others, to record the journey into the labyrinth. We write to expand our world when we feel strangled, or constricted, or lonely... When I don\'t write, I feel my world shrinking... I feel I lose my fire and my color.","A leaf fluttered in through the window this morning, as if supported by the rays of the sun, a bird settled on the fire escape, joy in the task of coffee, joy accompanied me as I walked.","We are going to the moon that is not very far. Man has so much farther to go within himself.","Why one writes is a question I can answer easily, having so often asked it of myself. I believe one writes because one has to create a world in which one can live. I could not live in any of the worlds offered to me - the world of my parents, the world of war, the world of politics. I had to create a world of my own, like a climate, a country, an atmosphere in which I could breathe, reign, and recreate myself when destroyed by living. That, I believe, is the reason for every work of art.","Dreams pass into the reality of action. From the actions stems the dream again; and this interdependence produces the highest form of living.","We do not escape into philosophy, psychology, and art--we go there to restore our shattered selves into whole ones.","Our culture made a virtue of living only as extroverts. We discouraged the inner journey, the quest for a center. So we lost our center and have to find it again.","When I stand at the top of the Champs-Elys\xe9es, with its chestnut trees in flower, its undulations of shining cars, its white spaciousness, I feel as if I were biting into a utopian fruit, something velvety and lustrous and rich and vivid.","Last night I wept. I wept because the process by which I have become woman was painful. I wept because I was no longer a child with a child\'s blind faith. I wept because my eyes were opened to reality....I wept because I could not believe anymore and I love to believe. I can still love passionately without believing. That means I love humanly. I wept because I have lost my pain and I am not yet accustomed to its absence.","Many couples, many people, are not living with real human beings, but with their ghosts. Who has not followed for years the spell of a particular tone of voice, from voice to voice, as the fetishist follows a beautiful foot, scarcely seeing the woman herself? A voice, a mouth, an eye, all stemming from the original fountain of our first desire, directing it, enslaving us, until we choose to unravel the fatal web and free ourselves.","I prefer by far the warmth and softness to mere brilliancy and coldness. Some people remind me of sharp dazzling diamonds. Valuable but lifeless and loveless. Others, of the simplest field flowers, with hearts full of dew and with all the tints of celestial beauty reflected in their modest petals.","You are so terribly nimble, so clever. I distrust your cleverness. You make a wonderful pattern, everything is in its place, it looks convincingly clear, too clear. And meanwhile, where are you? Not on the clear surface of your ideas, but you have already sunk deeper, into darker regions, so that one only thinks one has been given all your thoughts, one only imagines you have emptied yourself in that clarity. But there are layers and layers - you\'re bottomless, unfathomable. Your clearness is deceptive. You are the thinker who arouses most confusion in me, most doubt, most disturbance.","perhaps the only magician we have is the artist.","He does not need opium.  He has the gift of reverie.","In my childhood diary I wrote: \u201cI have decided that it is better not to love anyone, because when you love people, then you have to be separated from them, and that hurts too much.","The man who was once starved may revenge himself upon the world not by stealing just once, or by stealing only what he needs, but by taking from the world an endless toll in payment of something irreplaceable, which is the lost faith.","The dangerous time when mechanical voices, radios, telephones, take the place of human intimacies, and the concept of being in touch with millions brings a greater and greater poverty in intimacy and human vision.","When one is pretending the entire body revolts.","The richest source of creation is feeling, followed by a vision of its meaning.","[in the]..curious way that my idealism has been mixed with my fatalism, so that I can possess the soul of a dreamer and that of a cynic at the same time......I possess a power of magic...[to] destroy the balance of a well-designed destiny with my diabolical mind.","Solitude may rust your words.","What a mystery this is, desire. The love sickness, the sensitivity, the obsession, the flutter of the heart, the ebb and flow of the blood. There is no drug and no alcohol to equal it.","The bed must be a beautiful place, not only because you make love there but because you dream there as well.","I am like a snake who has already bitten. I retreat from a direct battle while knowing the slow effect of the poison.","I am only responsible for my own heart, you offered yours up for the smashing my darling. Only a fool would give out such a vital organ","I miss the animal buoyancy of New York, the animal vitality. I did not mind that it had no meaning and no depth.","The body is an instrument which only gives off music when it is used as a body. Always an orchestra, and just as music traverses walls, so sensuality traverses the body and reaches up to ecstasy.","Life, religion and art all converge in Bali. They have no word in their language for \'artist\' or \'art.\' Everyone is an artist.","In music I feel most deeply the passing of things.","The important task of literature is to free man, not to censor him, and that is why Puritanism was the most destructive and evil force which ever oppressed people and their literature: it created hypocrisy, perversion, fears, sterility.","Also, I do not like the companionship of women. They are petty and personal. They hang on to their mysteries and secrets, they act and pretend. I like the character of men better.","Through love, through friendship, a heart lives more than one life.","Adolescence is like cactus.","Poetry, which is our relation to the senses, enables us to retain a living relationship to all things. It is the quickest means of transportation to reach dimensions above or beyond the traps set by the so-called realists. It is a way to learn levitation and travel in liberated continents, to travel by moonlight as well as sunlight.","Is devotion to others a cover for the hungers and the needs of the self, of which one is ashamed? I was always ashamed to take. So I gave. It was not virtue. It was a disguise.","For too many centuries women have been being muses to artists. I wanted to be the muse, I wanted to be the wife of the artist, but I was really trying to avoid the final issue \u2014 that I had to do the job myself.","What can I do with my happiness? How can I keep it, conceal it, bury it where I may never lose it? I want to kneel as it falls over me like rain, gather it up with lace and silk, and press it over myself again.","Truth is something which can\'t be told in a few words. Those who simplify the universe only reduce the expansion of its meaning.","I would like to have your sureness. I am waiting for love, the core of a woman\'s life.\\" Don\'t wait for it,\\" I said. \\"Create a world, your world. Alone. Stand alone. And then love will come to you, then it comes to you. It was only when I wrote my first book that the world I wanted to live in opened to me.","The struggle to emerge out of the past, clean of memories; the inadequacy of our hearts to cut life into separate and final portions; the pain of this constant ambivalence and interrelation of emotions; the hunger for frontiers against which we might learn as upon closed doors before we proceed forward; the struggle against diffusion, new beginnings, against finality in acts without finality or end, in our cursedly repercussive being.","Creation which cannot express itself becomes madness.","Everything with me is either worship and passion or pity and understanding. I hate rarely, though when I hate. I hate murderously.","Stations and airports are rehearsals for separations by death.","One must be thrust out of a finished cycle in life, and that leap is the most difficult to make - to part with one\'s faith, one\'s love, when one would prefer to renew the faith and recreate the passion.","The unconscious can become destructive if it is disregarded and thwarted.","Perfection is static, \\n And \\n I am in full progress.","the cynic is a coward. He foresees all barrenness so that barrenness can never surprise him.","I can\u2019t let you go now. I want to go places with you; obscure little places, just to be able to say: here I came with her.","... and the very folds of the curtains contained secrets and sighs.","It is easy to love and there are so many ways to do it.","If a person continues to see giants, it means he is still looking at the world through the eyes of a child.","I want to live darkly and richly in my femaleness. I want a man lying over me, always over me. His will, his pleasure, his desire, his life, his work, his sexuality the touchstone, the command, my pivot. I don\u2019t mind working, holding my ground intellectually, artistically; but as a woman, oh, God, as a woman I want to be dominated","It is difficult to live with the pure. They do not condemn you; they forgive you. This forgiveness is more terrible than a judgment.","Travel is seeking the lost paradise. It is the supreme illusion of love.","Since desire always goes towards that which is our direct opposite, it forces us to love that which will make us suffer.","The one who travels like a lover searching for a new passion is suddenly blessed with new eyes, new ears, new senses.","Our love of each other was like two long shadows kissing without hope of reality.","Ordinary life does not interest me. I seek only the high moments. I am in accord with the surrealists, searching for the marvelous.","I know why families were created with all their imperfections. They humanize you. They are made to make you forget yourself occasionally, so that the beautiful balance of life is not destroyed.","The love of only one man or one woman is an enclosure.","Dreams are essential to life.","The personal, if it is deep enough, becomes universal, mythical, symbolic.","Societies in decline have no use for visionaries.","Women always think that when they have my shoes, my dress, my hairdresser, my makeup, it will all work the same way. They do not conceive of the witchcraft that is needed. They do not know that I am not beautiful but that I only appear to be at certain moments.","Beware of allowing a tactless word, a rebuttal, a rejection to obliterate the whole sky","I will not be just a tourist in the world of images, just watching images passing by which I cannot live in, make love to, possess as permanent sources of joy and ecstasy.","There is a resemblance between men and women, not a contrast. When a man begins to recognize his feeling, the two unite. When men accept the sensitive side of themselves, they come alive.","Only when the poet and the scientist work in unison will we have living experiences and knowledge of the marvels of the universe as they are being discovered.","The final lesson a writer learns is that everything can nourish the writer. The dictionary, a new word, a voyage, an encounter, a talk on the street, a book, a phrase learned.","Anxiety is love\'s greatest killer. It makes others feel as you might when a drowning man holds on to you. You want to save him, but you know he will strangle you with his panic.","I am in great terror of your understanding by which you penetrate into my world; and then I stand revealed and I have shared my kingdom with you.","What I cannot love, I overlook. Is that real friendship?","Something is always born of excess: great art was born of great terror, great loneliness, great inhibitions, instabilities, and it always balances them.","the best way to remember a beautiful city or a beautiful painting is to eat something while you are looking at it. The flavor really helps the image to penetrate the body. It fixes it as lacquer does a drawing.","If what Proust says is true, that happiness is the absence of fever, then I will never know happiness. For I am possessed by a fever for knowledge, experience, and creation.","Jazz is the music of the body. The breath comes through brass. It is the body\'s breath, and the strings\' wails and moans are echoes of the body\'s music. It is the body\'s vibrations which ripple from the fingers. And the mystery of the withheld theme, known to jazz musicians alone, is like the mystery of our secret life. We give to others only peripheral improvisations.","Perhaps a child, like a cat, is so much inside of himself that he does not see himself in the mirror.","I see myself wrapped in lies, which do not seem to penetrate my soul, as if they are not really a part of me. They are like costumes.","The most important human endeavor is the striving for morality in our actions. Our inner balance and even our very existence depend on it. Only morality in our actions can give beauty and dignity to life. Albert Einstein It is the function of art to renew our perception. What we are familiar with we cease to see. The writer shakes up the familiar scene, and, as if by magic, we see a new meaning in it.","If one\'s conscious life is too rigid, too regimented, then the surface may crack at times, and we are unprepared for the strange emotions or sensations we experience.","There are very few human beings who receive the truth, complete and staggering, by instant illumination. Most of them acquire it fragment by fragment, on a small scale, by successive developments, cellularly, like a laborious mosaic.","To lie, of course, is to engender insanity.","To withhold from living is to die ... the more you give of yourself to life the more life nourishes you.","I have no brakes on...analysis is for those who are paralyzed by life.","All that is sacred and taboo in the world are meaningless.","I stopped loving my father a long time ago. What remained was the slavery to a pattern.","You carry away with you a reflection of me, a part of me. I dreamed you; I wished for your existence. You will always be a part of my life. If I love you, it must be because we shared, at some moment, the same imaginings, the same madness, the same stage.","There is no bleaker moment in life of the city than that one which crosses the boundary lines between those who have not slept all night and those who are going to work. It was for Sabina as if two races of men and women lived on earth, the night people and the day people, never meeting face to face except at this moment.","When I cannot bear outer pressures anymore, I begin to put order in my belongings...As if unable to organize and control my life, I seek to exert this on the world of objects.","The ivory tower of the artist may be the only stronghold left for human values, cultural treasures, man\u2019s cult of beauty.","A trite word is an overused word which has lost its identity like an old coat in a second-hand shop. The familiar grows dull and we no longer see, hear, or taste it.","Tropical nights are hammocks for lovers.","I like extravagance. Letters which give the postman a stiff back to carry, books which overflow from their covers, sexuality which bursts the thermometers.","I have so strong a sense of creation, of tomorrow, that I cannot get drunk, knowing I will be less alive, less well, less creative the next day.","I have no fear of God, and yet fear keeps me awake at night,fear of the devil. And if I believe in the devil, I must believe in God. And if evil is abhorrent to me, I must be a saint. Henry, save me from beatification, from the horrors of static perfection. Precipitate me into the inferno.","Three or four threads may be agitated, like telegraph wires, at the same time, and if I were to tap them all I would reveal such a mixture of innocence and duplicity, generosity and calculation, fear and courage, I cannot tell the whole truth simply because I would have to write four journals at once.","Poverty is the great reality. That is why the artist seeks it.","It is my secrecy which makes you unhappy, my evasions, my silences. And so I have found a solution. Whenever you get desperate with my mysteries, my ambiguities, here is a set of Chinese puzzle boxes. You have always said that I was myself a Chinese puzzle box. When you are in the mood and I baffle your love of confidences, your love of openness, your love of sharing experiences, then open one of the boxes. And in it you will find a story, a story about me and my life. Do you like this idea? Do you think it will help us to live together?","Our psychological reality, which lies below the surface, frightens us because it endlessly surprises us and drives us in a direction which society\'s rules and organizations define as wrong or dangerous.","Writers do not live one life, they live two. There is the living and then there is the writing. There is the second tasting, the delayed reaction.","When I don\'t write, I feel my world shrinking. I feel I am in a prison. I feel I lose my fire and my color. It should be a necessity, as the sea needs to heave, and I call it breathing.","Physical experiences, lacking the joys of love, depend on twists and perversions of pleasure. Abnormal pleasures kill the taste for normal ones.","We celebrate peace. Yet we pay no attention to the ways of curing aggression in human beings. And when one sees in psychoanalysis hostility disappearing as people conquer their fears, one wonders if the cure is not there.","Then at certain moments I remember one of his words and I suddenly feel the sensual woman flaring up, as if violently caressed. I say the word to myself, with joy. It is at such a moment that my true body lives.","The child in me could not die as it should have died, because according too legends it must find its father again. The old legends knew, perhaps, that in absence the father becomes glorified, deified, eroticized, and this outrage against God the Father has to be atoned for. The human father has to be confronted and recognized as human, as man who created a child and then, by his absence, left the child fatherless and then Godless.","Death from disillusion is not instantaneous, and there are no mercy killers for the disillusioned.","It\'s all right for a woman to be, above all, human. I am a woman first of all.","But the artist persists because he has the will to create, and this is the magic power which can transform and transfigure and transpose and which will ultimately be transmitted to others.","I cheat him, I deceive him, yet the world does not sink in sulphur-colored mists. Madness conquers. I can no longer put my mosaics together. I just cry and laugh.","In the world of the dreamer there was solitude: all the exaltations and joys came in the moment of preparation for living. They took place in solitude.","I despise my own hypersensitiveness, which requires so much reassurance. It is certainly abnormal to crave so much to be loved and understood.","The city was asleep on its right side and shaking with violent nightmares. Long puffs of snoring came out of the chimneys. Its feet were sticking out because the clouds did not cover it altogether. There was a hole in them and the white feathers were falling out. The city had untied all its bridges like so many buttons to feel at ease. Wherever there was a lamplight the city scratched itself until it went out.","When she closed her eyes she felt he had many hands, which touched her everywhere, and many mouths, which passed so swiftly over her, and with a wolflike sharpness, his teeth sank into her fleshiest parts. Naked now, he lay his full length over her. She enjoyed his weight on her, enjoyed being crushed under his body. She wanted him soldered to her, from mouth to feet. Shivers passed through her body.","I have a prejudice against people with money. I have known so many, and none have escaped the corruption of power. In this I am a purist. I love people motivated by love and not by power. If you have money and power, and are motivated by love, you give it all away.","Introspection is a devouring monster. You have to feed it with much material, much experience, many people, many places, many loves, many creations, and then it ceases feeding on you.","At sixteen, Sabina took moon baths, first of all, because everyone else took sun baths, and second, she admitted, because she had been told it was dangerous.","Descendants of pigeons once fed by Keats, Byron, George Sand, Chopin and many other famous lovers are still being fed, and the sudden sound when they all rise together, frightened away, is like the sound of giant sails flapping.","We speak of the masculine and the feminine, but they are the wrong labels. It is really more a matter of poetry versus intellectualization.","If you are terribly truthful, the ground will always move from under you, and you will have to shift with the constantly shifting truth.","The complaints of the child in us will never cease lamenting until it is consoled, answered, understood. Only then will it lie still in us, like our fears. It will die in peace and leave us what the child leaves to the man - the sense of wonder.","The role of the writer is not to say what we can all say, but what we are unable to say. Most of the writing today which is called fiction contains such a poverty of language, such triteness, that it is a shrunken, diminished world we enter, poorer and more formless than the poorest cripple deprived of ears and eyes and tongue. The writer\'s responsibility is to increase, develop our senses, expand our vision, heighten our awareness and enrich our articulateness.","To write at the same temperature at which I live I should write nothing but poetry.","I\'m sick of my own romanticism!","... only love begets love.","The dream has to be translated into reality.","destruction is ultimately self-destruction.","I looked upon a clock to find the truth. The hours were passing like ivory chess figures, striking piano notes, and the minutes raced on wires mounted like tin soldiers. Hours like tall ebony women with gongs between their legs, tolling continuously so that I could not count them. I heard the rolling of my heart-beats; I heard the footsteps of my dreams, and the beat of time was lost among them like the face of truth.","Asia discovered two remedies for the cruelty of man, art and religion. America discarded both and is drowning in hate and aggressivity.","Every individual is representative of the whole . . . and should be intimately understood, and this would give a far greater understanding of mass movements and sociology.","I only regret that everybody wants to deprive me of the journal, which is the only steadfast friend I have, the only one which makes my life bearable, because my happiness with human beings is so precarious, my confiding moods rare, and the least sign of non-interest is enough to silence me. In the journal I am at ease.","Self-destructive patterns cause as much suffering as outer catastrophes.","Writing more and more to the sound of music, writing more and more like music. Sitting in my studio tonight, playing record after record, writing, music a stimulant of the highest order, far more potent than wine.","At first I protested and rebelled against poetry. I was about to deny my poetic worlds. I was doing violence to my illusions with analysis, science, and learning Henry\u2019s language, entering Henry\u2019s world. I wanted to destroy by violence and animalism my tenuous fantasies and illusions and my hypersensitivity. A kind of suicide. The ignominy awakened me. Then June came and answered the cravings of my imagination and saved me. Or perhaps she killed me, for now I am started on a course of madness.","To think of him in the middle of the day lifts me out of ordinary living.","The shell is America\'s most active contribution to the formation of character. A tough hide. Grow it early.","I believe that in judging our actions we are more severe than professional judges. We judge not only our actions, but our thoughts, our intentions, our secret curses, our hidden hate.","The impetus to grow and live intensely is so powerful in me I cannot resist it. I will work, I will love my husband, but I will fulfill myself.","The failures are not due to any injustice, but to an inner defect. It is always caused by the person himself. Yes, I know, you think you are doing an act of justice. But they will only suck you dry, wear out your energy, nourish themselves on your ideas. After being the most compassionate man in the world, I say to you today: Let the weak ones die, let them commit suicide.","There were silences in my head. I could abandon myself completely to the pleasure of multiple relationships, to the beauty of the day, to the joys of the day. It was as if a cancer in me had ceased gnawing me. The cancer of introspection.","Big Business and Politics are twins, they are the monsters who kill everything, corrupt everything.","I am lonely, yet not everybody will do. I don\'t know why, some people fill the gaps and others emphasize my loneliness. In reality those who satisfy me are those who simply allow me to live with my \'\'idea of them.","If all of us acted in unison as I act individually there would be no wars and no poverty. I have made myself personally responsible for the fate of every human being who has come my way.","We three belong to the Middle Ages. We have this need of heroism, and there is no place for such feelings in modern life. That is our tragedy. Once I wanted to be a saint. It seemed the only absolute act left to do, for what is most powerful in me is the craving for purity, greatness.","I often see how you sob over what you destroy, how you want to stop and just worship; and you do stop, and then a moment later you are at it again with a knife, like a surgeon.","When I hear of people who weary of each other, I believe it is because they have sought virtues in themselves alone, attractions of physical beauty. Have they based their love on each other\'s thoughts? Who can weary of thoughts which change every day?","How well I know with what burning intensity you live. You have experienced many lives already, including several you have shared with me- full rich lives from birth to death, and you just have to have these rest periods in between.","The diary taught me that it is in the moments of emotional crisis that human beings reveal themselves most accurately. I learned to choose the heightened moments because they are the moments of revelation.","Either one fails in one\'s art or in one\'s life.","The human father has to be confronted and recognized as human, as man who created a child and then, by his absence, left the child fatherless and then Godless.","The poet is one who is able to keep the fresh vision of the child alive.","The final lesson a writer learns is that everything can nourish the writer.","We don\'t see things as they are, we see them as we are.\\" Life shrinks or expands in proportion to one\'s courage \\"People living deeply have no fear of death.","Coming near him like a ballet dancer she took a leap towards him, and he, frightened by her vehemence, and fearing that she would crash against him, instinctively became absolutely rigid, and she felt herself embracing a statue.","I gathered poets around me and we all wrote beautiful erotica. As we were condemned to focus only on sensuality, we had violent explosions of poetry. Writing erotica became a road to sainthood rather than to debauchery.","We don\'t see things as they are, we see them as we ... believe me na\xefve or innocent, who has the courage to treat me like a woman.","My first vision of earth was water veiled. I am of the race of men and women who see all things through this curtain of sea and my eyes are the color of water.","Out of the red and silver and the long cry of alarm to the poet who survives in all human beings, as the child survives in him; to this poet she threw an unexpected ladder in the middle of the city and ordained, \'Climb!","Our age has need of violence,\\" he writes. And he is violence.","One discovers that destiny can be diverted, that one does not have to remain in bondage to the first wax imprint made on childhood sensibilities. Once the deforming mirror has been smashed, there is a possibility of wholeness. There is a possibility of joy.","Memory is a great betrayer.","I want to be a writer who reminds others that these moments exist; I want to prove that there is infinite space, infinite meaning, infinite dimension","Keeping a Diary all my life helped me to discover some basic elements essential to the vitality of writing.","I will not be just a tourist in a world of images.","All those who try to unveil the mysteries always have tragic lives. At the end they are always punished.","He has, like me, a sense of smell. I let him inhale me, then I slip away.","She had lost herself somewhere along the frontier between her inventions, her stories, her fantasies and her true self. The boundaries had become effaced, the tracks lost, she had walked into pure chaos, and not a chaos which carried her like the galloping of romantic riders in operas and legends, but which suddenly revealed the stage props: a papier-m\xe2ch\xe9 horse.","Why do I doubt her? Perhaps she is just very sensitive, and hypersensitive people are false when others doubt them; they waver. And one thinks them insincere. Yet I want to believe her. At the same time it does not seem so very important that she should love me. It is not her role. I am so filled with my love of her. And at the same time I feel that I am dying. Our love would be death. The embrace of imaginings.","The period without the diary remains an ordeal. Every evening I want my diary as one wants opium.","gold never comes to the dreamers - except in dreams.","Strange, isn\'t it, that no chemical will give a human being the iridescence that illusions have given them? Give me your hat.","There is no denying that we are suffering from a collective neurosis and the novel which does not face this is not a novel of our time.","I hate rarely, though when I hate, I hate murderously.","He was jealous of her future, and she of his past.","New York has an electronic heart.","Nothing endures unless it has first been transposed into a myth, and the great advantage of myths is that they are ladies with portable roots.","But I lie. I embellish. My words are not deep enough. They disguise, they conceal. I will not rest until I have told of my descent into a sensuality which was as dark, as magnificent, as wild, as my moments of mystic creation have been dazzling, ecstatic, exalted.","Will you come down and kiss me good night?","notes fly so much farther than words. There is no other way to reach the infinite.","If you can\'t create, you destroy.","Often, though, the passivity of the woman\'s role weighs on me, suffocates me. Rather than wait for his pleasure, I would like to take it, to run wild. Is it that which pushes me into lesbianism? It terrifies me. Do women act thus? Does June go to Henry when she wants him? Does she mount him? Does she wait for him? He guides my inexperienced hands. It is like a forest fire, to be with him. New places of my body are aroused and burnt. He is incendiary. I leave him in an unquenchable fever.","Not afraid of poverty and drabness and who is untouched by it, untouched by the drunkenness of her friends; (she) who judges, selects, discards people with severity, who knows, when she is telling her endless anecdotes, that they are ways of escape, keeping herself all the more secret behind that profuse talk.","They courted the face on the screen, the face of translucence, the face of wax on which men found it possible to imprint the image of their fantasy.","I want to make my own discoveries\u2026\u2026.penetrate the evil which attracts me","She makes use of the soft of the bread for a napkin. She falls asleep at times with shoes on, on unmade beds. When a little money comes in, June buys delicacies, strawberries in the winter, caviar and bath salts.","A big enough artist, I say, can eat anything, must eat everything and then alchemize it. Only the feeble writer is afraid of expansion.","I did not feel drawn to huxley. He was beautiful physically but again without vibrations or sensory antennae... and I had a painful impression of a psychic blindness. With all his science and knowledge, in the mystic world he blundered.","People who want a sane, static, measurable world take the first aspect of an event or person and stick to it, with an almost self-protective obstinacy, or by a natural limitation of their imaginations. They do not indulge in either deepening or magnifying.","she acquired the certainty of the expansion of time by depth of emotion, range and infinite multiplicity of experience.","Again I take a taxi to Clichy address, but feel that I do not want to go on loving Henry more actively than he loves me (having realized that nobody will ever love me in that overabundant, overexpressive, overthoughtful, overhuman way I love people), and so I will wait for him. So I ask taxi driver to drop me at the Galeries Lafayette, where I begin to look for a new hat and to shop for Christmas. Pride? I don\'t know. A kind of wise retreat. I need people too much. So I bury my gigantic defect, my overflow of love, under trivialities, like a child. I amuse myself with a new hat.","I had been struck by the analogy between neurosis and romanticism. Romanticism was truly a parallel to neurosis. It demanded of reality an illusory world, love, an absolute which it could never obtain, and thus destroyed itself by the dream.","..he made me understand something very important. Whether because I am a Latin, or because I am a neurotic, I have a need of gestures. I am myself expressive, demonstrative; every feeling I have takes on expression: words, gestures, signs, letters, articulateness or action. I need this in others.","This great handsomeness I took into myself later when he desired me, but I took it as one breathes air, or swallows a snowflake, or yields to the sun.","Talk\u2014half-talk, phrases that had no need to be finished, abstractions, Chinese bells played on with cotton-tipped sticks, mock orange blossoms painted on porcelain. The muffled, close, half-talk of soft-fleshed women. The men she had embraced, and the women, all washing against the resonance of my memory. Sound within sound, scene within scene, woman within woman\u2014like acid revealing an invisible script. One woman within another eternally, in a far-reaching procession, shattering my mind into fragments, into quarter tones which no orchestral baton can ever make whole again.","Secrets. Need to disguise. The novel was born of this.","To commit suicide is easy. To live without a god is more difficult. The drunkenness of triumph is greater than the drunkenness of sacrifice.","This image of herself as a not ordinary women, an image which was trembling now in his eyes, might suddenly disappear. Nothing more difficult to live up to than men\'s dreams.","To mistake ugliness for reality is one of the frauds of the realistic school [of writing]. A hunger for the unknown and an aspiration toward beauty were inseparable from civilization. In America the word art was distorted to mean artificial.","Houses turn to corpses overnight when we cease to live and love in them.","America hates the artist. It will not admit: the artist is my soul and I want to kill off my soul.","In my dreams I sleep with everybody.","Guilt is the one burden human beings can\'t bear alone.","I love man as creator, lover, husband, friend, but man the father I do not trust. I do not believe in man as father. I do not trust man as father.","... America is the greatest humiliator in existence. It is always cultivating the power you get from humiliating others.","I am so thirsty for the marvelous that only the marvelous has power over me. Anything I can not transform into something marvelous, I let go.","To write is to descend, to excavate, to go underground.","We must protect the minority writers because they are the research workers of literature. They keep it alive. It has been fashionable of late to seek out and force such writers into more popular channels, to the detriment of both writer and an unprepared public.","I am a failure as a writer. The publishers won\'t publish me, the bookshops won\'t carry my books, the critics won\'t write about me. I am excluded from all anthologies, and completely ignored.","My trunk, valises and my mind are overpacked.","The core of creation is to summon an image and the power to work with the image.","The way to recognize a dead word is that it exudes boredom.","For all of my patients sensuality is a giving in to \'the low side of their nature.\' Puritanism is powerful and distorts their life with a total anesthesia of the senses. If you atrophy one sense, you also atrophy all the others, a sensuous and physical connection with nature, with art, with food, with other human beings.","although I love a rich life, I hate an overcrowded life. I believe in rumination and lose half the beauty of all things when I am deprived of the time to ruminate.","While analyzing so many people I realized the constant need of a mother, or a father, or a god (the same thing) is really immaturity. It is a childish need, a human need, but so universal that I can see how it gave birth to all religions.","In every relationship, sooner or later, there is a court scene. Accusations, counter-accusations, a trial, a verdict.","He understands my pity for his ridiculous, humiliating physical necessity.","Anxiety is loves greatest killer.","Your strength is soft, indirect, delicate, tender, womanly. But it is strength just the same.","I had a feeling that Pandora\'s box contained the mysteries of woman\'s sensuality, so different from a man\'s and for which man\'s language was so inadequate. The language of sex had yet to be invented. The language of the senses was yet to be explored.","The writer is the duelist who never fights at the stated hour, who gathers up an insult, like another curious object, a collector\'s item, spreads it out on his desk later, and then engages in a duel with it verbally. Some people call it weakness. I call it postponement. What is weakness in the man becomes a quality in the writer. For he preserves, collects what will explode later in his work. That is why the writer is the loneliest man in the world; because he lives, fights, dies, is reborn always alone; all his roles are played behind a curtain. In life he is an incongruous figure.","Anxiety is love\'s greatest killer, because it is like the stranglehold of the drowning.","A man who lives unrelated to other human beings dies. But a man who lives unrelated to himself also dies.","My diary seems to keep me whole.","The same chemicals were used in the cooking as were used on the composition of her own being: only those which caused the most violent reaction, contradiction, and teasing, the refusal to answer questions but the love of putting them, and all the strong spices of human relationship which bore a relation to black pepper, paprika, soybean sauce, ketchup and red peppers.","I was thinking of my patients, and how the worst moment for them was when they discovered they were masters of their own fate. It was not a matter of bad or good luck. When they could no longer blame fate, they were in despair.","I want to fall in love in such a way that the mere sight of a man, even a block away from me, will shake and pierce me, will weaken me, and make me tremble and soften and melt.","What you burnt, broke, and tore is still in my hands. I am the keeper of fragile things and I have kept of you what is indissoluble.","I palliate the sufferings of others. yes I see myself as softening the blows, dissolving acids, neutralizing poisons, every moment of the day. I try to fulfill the wishes of others, to perform miracles. I exert myself performing miracles.","The truly faithless one is the one who makes love to only a fraction of you. And denies the rest.","I sat there for three hours and did not feel the time or the boredom of our talk and its foolish disconnection. As long as I could hear his voice, I was quite lost, quite blind, quite outside my own self.","She was fully, painfully aware that very rarely did midnight strike in two hearts at once, very rarely did midnight arouse two different equal desires, and that any dislocation in this, any indifference, was an indication of disunity, of the difficulties, the impossibilities of fusion between two human beings.","I have seen romanticism outlast the realistic. I have seen men forget the beautiful women they have possessed, forget the prostitutes, and remember the first woman they idolized, the woman they could never have. The woman who aroused them romantically holds them.","We did not touch each other. We were both leaning over the abyss.","Now that I am moving, I am afraid. Where am I going?","The leaf fall of his words, the stained glass hues of his moods, the rust in his voice, the smoke in his mouth, his breath on my vision like human breath blinding a mirror.","I seek the real stuff of life. Profound drama.","Worlds self made are so full of monsters and demons.","Sexual intercourse... a joyous, joyous, joyous, joyous impaling of woman on man\'s sensual mast.","Someone told me the delightful story of the crusader who put a chastity belt on his wife and gave the key to his best friend for safekeeping, in case of his death. He had ridden only a few miles away when his friend, riding hard, caught up with him, saying \'You gave me the wrong key!","There is an ugliness in being paid for work one does not like.","When I don\'t write, I feel my world shrink. I lose my fire, my color.","jazz is the expression of America\'s romantic self, its sensual potency, its lyrical force.","New York seems conducted by jazz, animated by it. It is essentially a city of rhythm.","In New York the acoustics are good for laughter, for life is all external, all action, no thought, no meditation, no dreaming, no reflection, only the exuberance of action.","[On Paris:] A city never entirely known, yet which gives you the feeling of intimacy, of possessing it intimately.","One handles truths like dynamite. Literature is one vast hypocrisy, a giant deception, treachery. All writers have concealed more than they revealed.","In creation alone there is the possibility of perfection.","All the art of analysis consists in saying a truth only when the other person is ready for it, has been prepared for it by an organic process of gradation and evolution.","I\'m restless. Things are calling me away. My hair is being pulled by the stars again. ANA\xcfS NIN, Fire: From \\"A Journal of Love\\" The Unexpurgated Diary of Ana\xefs Nin, 1934-1938 For me, the adventures of the mind, each inflection of thought, each movement, nuance, growth, discovery, is a source of exhilaration.","Analysis does not take into account the creative products of neurotic desires.","The preoccupation of the novelist: how to capture the living moments, was answered by the diary. You write while you are alive. You do not preserve them in alcohol until the moment you are ready to write about them.","I say quotations are literary. They are good only when dealing with ideas, not with experience. Experience should be pure, unique.","I have an attitude now that is immovable. I shall remain outside of the world, beyond the temporal, beyond all the organizations of the world. I only believe in poetry.","The basis of insincerity is the idealized image we hold of ourselves and wish to impose on others.","The body is an instrument which only gives off music when it is used as a body.","I know no joy as great as a moment of rushing into a new love, no ecstasy like that of a new love.","He had a mania for washing and disinfecting himself. . . . For him the only danger came from the microbes that attacked the body. He had not studied the microbe of conscience which eats into the soul.","Most artists have retired too absolutely; they grow rusty, inflexible to the flow of currents.","I spell \'god\' with a small \'g\' because I do not believe in him, but I love to swear by him.","A man fell in love with Jeanne, and she tried to love him. But she complained that he uttered such ordinary words, that he could never say the magic phrase which would open her being.","I prefer empty cages, Sabina, until I find a unique bird I once saw in my dreams.","If a person continues to see only giants, it means he is still seeing the world through the eyes of a child. I have a feeling that man\'s fear of woman comes from having first seen her as the mother, creator of men.","Idealism is the death of the body and the imagination. All but freedom, utter freedom, is death","He was now in that state of fire that she loved. She wanted to be burnt.","I see enormous loves growing immense and finally crushing me.","You marry the day you realize the human defects of your love.","The softness of the summer day like an ermine paw.","Acapulco in the sunset seems like a balm; it enters the blood like a drug after one inhalation of the scent of flowers, one glimpse of the bay iridescent like silk, the sunset like the inside of a shell, so much like the flesh of Venus.","The woman will sit eternally in the tall black armchair. I will be the one woman you will never have...excessive living weighs down the imagination: we will not live, we will only write and talk to swell the sails.","This diary is my kief, hashish and opium pipe. This is my drug and my vice.","I really believe that if I were not a writer, not a creator, not an experimenter, I might have been a very faithful wife. I think highly of faithfulness. But my temperament belongs to the writer, not to the woman","I am aware of being in a beautiful prison, from which I can only escape by writing.","His life rushes onward in such torrential rhythm that...only angels and devils can catch the tempo of it.","I do not want to be the leader. I refuse to be the leader. I want to live darkly.","I write emotional algebra.","It amazes me that you feel that each time you write a story you give away one of your dreams and you feel the poorer for it. But then you have not thought that this dream is planted in others, others begin to live it too, it is shared, it is the beginning of friendship and love. How is this world made which you enjoy, the friends around me that you love? They came because I first gave away my stories.","Our love lives because I live.","To change skins, evolve into new cycles, I feel one has to learn to discard","He, who had done more than any human being to draw her out of the caves of her secret, folded life, now threw her down into deeper recesses of fear and doubt. The fall was greater than she had ever known, because she had ventured so far into emotion and had abandoned herself to it.","I wanted to remember in order to be able to return.","Jeanne, I fell asleep among the paintings, where I could sit for many days worshipping your portrait. I fell in love with your portrait, Jeanne, because it will never change. I have such a fear of seeing you grow old, Jeanne, I fell in love with an unchanging you that will never be taken away from me. I was wishing you would die, so that no one could take you away from me, and I would love the painting of you as you would look eternally.","To love and to labor is the sum of living.","Warmth, perfume, rugs, soft lights, books. They do not appease me. I am aware of time passing, of all the world contains that I have not seen, of all the interesting people I have not met.","She had acquired some of his gypsy ways, some of his nonchalance, his bohemian indiscipline. She had swung with him into the disorders of strewn clothes, spilled cigarette ashes, slipping into bed all dressed, falling asleep thus, indolence, timelessness...A region of chaos and moonlight. She liked it there.","And silence. She liked the silence most of all. The silence in which the body, senses, the instincts, are more alert, more powerful, more sensitized, live a more richly perfumed and intoxication life, instead of transmuting into thoughts, words, into exquisite abstractions, mathematics of emotion in place of violent impact, the volcanic eruptions of fever, lust and delight.","At first she beckoned and lured one into her world; then, she blurred the passageways, confused all the images, as if to elude detection.","We efface an hour by passionate love, without twists, without aftertaste. When it is finished, it is not finished, we lie still in each other\'s arms lulled by our love, by tenderness -- sensuality in which the whole being can participate.","The morning I got up to begin this book I coughed. Something was coming out of my throat: it was strangling me. I broke the thread which held it and yanked it out. I went back to bed and said: I have just spat out my heart.","Innocence was gone from all our acts. Our habitual state of rebellion became a serious political crime.","Great repressions create dualities.","I told her, \\"We have both lost ourselves, but sometimes we reveal the most when we are least like ourselves. I am not trying to think any more. I can\'t think when I am with you. You are like me, wishing for a perfect moment, but nothing too long imagined can be perfect in a worldly way. Neither one of us can say just the right thing. We are overwhelmed. Let us be overwhelmed. It is so lovely, so lovely. I love you June.","I cannot concentrate all my friendship on any single one of my friends because no one is complete enough in himself.","Too late for changes, too late perhaps for explanations and ideological webs, but the love goes on, the love goes on, blind to laws and warnings and even to wisdom and to fears. And whatever that love is, perhaps an illusion of a new love, I want it, I cant resist it, my whole being melts in one kiss, my knowledge melts, my fears melt, my blood dances, my legs open.","The violence and obscenity are left unadulterated, as manifestation of the mystery and pain which ever accompanies the act of creation.","The true liberation of eroticism lies in accepting the fact that there are a million facets to it, a million forms of eroticism, a million objects of it, situations, atmospheres, and variations. We have, first of all, to dispense with guilt concerning its expansion, then remain open to it\'s surprises, varied expressions, and mingle it with dreams, fantasies, and emotion for it to attain its highest potency.","One always, sooner or later, comes upon a city which is an image of one\'s inner cities. Fez is an image of my inner self. ... The layers of the city of Fez are like the layers and secrecies of the inner life. One needs a guide. ... There were in Fez, as in my life, streets which led nowhere, impasses which remained a mystery.","One may gain one truth at the expense of another.","We sit on the kitchen exchanging these diabolical outgrowths of overfertile minds.","Some people read to confirm their own hopelessness. Others read to be rescued from it.","I am quite wiling to confide entirely in human being, except that at some moment or another human beings get preoccupied, moody, busy, inattentive, and there come an end to the interest, and this never happens in a journal!","She walked in the shadow of Rango with a great feeling of being taken out of herself, of having no knowledge of what was happening to her, merely a pervading sense of flow.","I love your silences, they are like mine. You are the only being before whom I am not distressed by my own silences. You have a vehement silence, one feels it is charged with essences, it is a strangely alive silence, like a trap open over a well, from which one can hear the secret murmur of the earth itself.","In each studio there is a human being dressed in the full regalia of his myth fearing to expore a vulnerable opening, spreading not his charms but his defences, plotting to disrobe, somewhere along the night-- his body without the aperture of the heart or his heart with a door closed to his body. thus keeping one compartment for refuge, one uninvaded cell.","Instead of answering her as soon as he saw her hair grow electric, her face more vivid, her eyes like lightning, her body restless and jerky like a racehorse\u2019s, he retired behind this wall of objective understanding, this gentle testing and acceptance of her, just as one watches an animal in the zoo and smiles at his antics, but is not drawn into this mood. It was this which left Lilith in a state of isolation - indeed, like a wild animal in an absolute desert.","The monster I kill every day is the monster of realism. The monster who attacks me every day is destruction. Out of the duel comes the transformation. I turn destruction into creation over and over again.","To the woman with the least intelligence, there must come, at some time or other, the realization that housework is animal work and that there are other occupations in the world a thousand times more refined, more enriching, for which she is also suited and to which she has a right.","For the neurotic, the merging of the subconscious and the conscious may be risky, just as it is for the users of drugs. But for the writer who is aware of the way in which this connection exists in reality and nourishes creativity, the sooner he can achieve a synthesis among intellect, emotion, and instinct, the sooner his work will be integrated.","When I first met him, he did not care if a friend did not fit into his world, because at that time his world had not been born yet.","Hollywood is a mirage factory.","I love her for what she has dared to be, for her hardness, her cruelty, her egoism, her perverseness, her demoniac destructiveness. She would crush me to ashes without hesitation. She is a personality created to the limit. I worship her courage to hurt, and I am willing to be sacrificed to it. She will add the sum of me to her. She will be June plus all that I contain.","I believe that men are generally still a little afraid of the dark though the witches are all hung, and Christianity and candles have been introduced.","I looked at it [revolver] as if it reminded me of a crime I had committed with an irrepressible smile such as rises sometimes to people\u2019s lips in the face of great catastrophes which are beyond their grasp, the smile that comes at times on certain women\u2019s faces while they are saying they regret the harm they have done. It is the smile of nature quietly and proudly asserting its natural right to kill.","I must know, he thinks. It must be clear to me. There is a world which is closed to him, a world of shadings, gradations, nuances, and subtleties. He is a genius and yet he is too explicit. June slips between his fingers. You cannot posses without loving.","atrophy of feeling creates criminals.","Paris-New York, the two high tension magnetic poles between life, life of the senses, of the spirit in Paris, and life in action in New York.","We write to taste life twice, in the moment and in retrospect.","I, with a deeper instinct, choose a man who compels my strength, who makes enormous demands on me, who does not doubt my courage or my toughness, who does not believe me na\xefve or innocent, who has the courage to treat me like a woman.","Each friend represents a world in us, a world possibly not born until they arrive, and it is only by this meeting that a new world is born.","How wrong is it for a woman to expect the man to build the world she wants, rather than to create it herself?","We do not grow absolutely, chronologically. We grow sometimes in one dimension, and not in another; unevenly. We grow partially. We are relative. We are mature in one realm, childish in another. The past, present, and future mingle and pull us backward, forward, or fix us in the present. We are made up of layers, cells, constellations.","Reality doesn\'t impress me. I only believe in intoxication, in ecstasy, and when ordinary life shackles me, I escape, one way or another. No more walls.","The role of a writer is not to say what we can all say, but what we are unable to say.","You live like this, sheltered, in a delicate world, and you believe you are living. Then you read a book\u2026 or you take a trip\u2026 and you discover that you are not living, that you are hibernating. The symptoms of hibernating are easily detectable: first, restlessness. The second symptom (when hibernating becomes dangerous and might degenerate into death): absence of pleasure. That is all. It appears like an innocuous illness. Monotony, boredom, death. Millions live like this (or die like this) without knowing it. They work in offices. They drive a car. They picnic with their families. They raise children. And then some shock treatment takes place, a person, a book, a song, and it awakens them and saves them from death. Some never awaken.","Man can never know the loneliness a woman knows. Man lies in the woman\'s womb only to gather strength, he nourishes himself from this fusion, and then he rises and goes into the world, into his work, into battle, into art. He is not lonely. He is busy. The memory of the swim in amniotic fluid gives him energy, completion. Woman may be busy too, but she feels empty. Sensuality for her is not only a wave of pleasure in which she is bathed, and a charge of electric joy at contact with another. When man lies in her womb, she is fulfilled, each act of love a taking of man within her, an act of birth and rebirth, of child rearing and man bearing. Man lies in her womb and is reborn each time anew with a desire to act, to be. But for woman, the climax is not in the birth, but in the moment man rests inside of her.","I am the most tired woman in the world. I am tired when I get up. Life requires an effort I cannot make. Please give me that heavy book. I need to put something heavy like that on top of my head. I have to place my feet under the pillows always, so as to be able to stay on earth. Otherwise I feel myself going away, going away at a tremendous speed, on account of my lightness. I know that I am dead. As soon as I utter a phrase my sincerity dies, becomes a lie whose coldness chills me. Don\'t say anything, because I see that you understand me, and I am afraid of your understanding. I have such a fear of finding another like myself, and such a desire to find one! I am so utterly lonely, but I also have such a fear that my isolation be broken through, and I no longer be the head and ruler of my universe. I am in great terror of your understanding by which you penetrate into my world; and then I stand revealed and I have to share my kingdom with you.","I do not want to be the leader. I refuse to be the leader. I want to live darkly and richly in my femaleness. I want a man lying over me, always over me. His will, his pleasure, his desire, his life, his work, his sexuality the touchstone, the command, my pivot. I don\u2019t mind working, holding my ground intellectually, artistically; but as a woman, oh, God, as a woman I want to be dominated. I don\u2019t mind being told to stand on my own feet, not to cling, be all that I am capable of doing, but I am going to be pursued, fucked, possessed by the will of a male at his time, his bidding.","Question: I am interested in so many things, and I have a terrible fear because my mother keeps telling me that I\'m just going to be exploring the rest of my life and never get anything done. But I find it really hard to set my ways and say, \\"Well, do I want to do this, or should I try to exploit that, or should I escape and completely do one thing?\\"Ana\xefs Nin: One word I would banish from the dictionary is \'escape.\' Just banish that and you\'ll be fine. Because that word has been misused regarding anybody who wanted to move away from a certain spot and wanted to grow. He was an escapist. You know if you forget that word you will have a much easier time. Also you\'re in the prime, the beginning of your life; you should experiment with everything, try everything.... We are taught all these dichotomies, and I only learned later that they could work in harmony. We have created false dichotomies; we create false ambivalences, and very painful one\'s sometimes -the feeling that we have to choose. But I think at one point we finally realize, sometimes subconsciously, whether or not we are really fitted for what we try and if it\'s what we want to do.You have a right to experiment with your life. You will make mistakes. And they are right too. No, I think there was too rigid a pattern. You came out of an education and are supposed to know your vocation. Your vocation is fixed, and maybe ten years later you find you are not a teacher anymore or you\'re not a painter anymore. It may happen. It has happened. I mean Gauguin decided at a certain point he wasn\'t a banker anymore; he was a painter. And so he walked away from banking. I think we have a right to change course. But society is the one that keeps demanding that we fit in and not disturb things. They would like you to fit in right away so that things work now.","Everything with me is either worship and passion or pity and understanding. I hate rarely, though when I hate, I hate murderously. For example now, I hate the bank and everything connected with it. I also hate Dutch paintings, penis-sucking, parties, and cold rainy weather. But I am much more preoccupied with loving.","There is not one big cosmic meaning for all; there is only the meaning we each give to our life, an individual meaning, an individual plot, like an individual novel, a book for each person.","What I cannot love, I overlook.","I only believe in intoxication, in ecstasy, and when ordinary life shackles me, I escape, one way or another. No more walls.","Do you know what I would answer to someone who asked me for a description of myself, in a hurry? This:?? !!For indeed my life is a perpetual question mark--my thirst for books, my observations of people, all tend to satisfy a great, overwhelming desire to know, to understand, to find an answer to a million questions. And gradually the answers are revealed, many things are explained, and above all, many things are given names and described, and my restlessness is subdued. Then I become an exclamatory person, clapping my hands to the immense surprises the world holds for me, and falling from one ecstasy into another. I have the habit of peeping and prying and listening and seeking--passionate curiosity and expectation. But I have also the habit of being surprised, the habit of being filled with wonder and satisfaction each time I stumble on some wondrous thing. The first habit could make me a philosopher or a cynic or perhaps a humorist. But the other habit destroys all the delicate foundations, and I find each day that I am still...only a Woman!","When does real love begin?At first it was a fire, eclipses, short circuits, lightning and fireworks; the incense, hammocks, drugs, wines, perfumes; then spasm and honey, fever, fatigue, warmth, currents of liquid fire, feast and orgies; then dreams, visions, candlelight, flowers, pictures; then images out of the past, fairy tales, stories, then pages out of a book, a poem; then laughter, then chastity. At what moment does the knife wound sink so deep that the flesh begins to weep with love?At first power, power, then the wound, and love, and love and fears, and the loss of the self, and the gift, and slavery. At first I ruled, loved less; then more, then slavery. Slavery to his image, his odor, the craving, the hunger, the thirst, the obsession.","I am lonely, yet not everybody will do. I don\u2019t know why, some people fill the gaps and others emphasize my loneliness.","When we blindly adopt a religion, a political system, a literary dogma, we become automatons.","life is truly known only to those who suffer, lose, endure adversity, & stumble from defeat to defeat.","I have such a fear of finding another like myself, and such a desire to find one! I am so utterly lonely, but I also have such a fear that my isolation be broken through, and I no longer be the head and ruler of my universe.","When one is pretending, the entire body revolts.","To hell, to hell with balance! I break glasses; I want to burn, even if I break myself. I want to live only for ecstasy. I\u2019m neurotic, perverted, destructive, fiery, dangerous - lava, inflammable, unrestrained.","You have a right to experiment with your life. You will make mistakes. And they are right too. No, I think there was too rigid a pattern. You came out of an education and are supposed to know your vocation. Your vocation is fixed, and maybe ten years later you find you are not a teacher anymore or you\'re not a painter anymore. It may happen. It has happened.

But society is the one that keeps demanding that we fit in and not disturb things. They would like you to fit in right away so that things work now.","Stories do not end.","Passion gives me moments of wholeness","It takes courage to push yourself to places you have never been before... to test yout limits... to break through barriers. And the day came when the risk it took to stay tight inside the bud was more painful than the risk it took to blossum.","I would like to have your sureness. I am waiting for love, the core of a woman\'s life.\\"Don\'t wait for it,\\" I said. \\"Create a world, your world. Alone. Stand alone. And then love will come to you, then it comes to you. It was only when I wrote my first book that the world I wanted to live in opened to me.","I know why familles were created, with all their imperfections. They humanize you. They are made to make you forget yourself occasionally, so that the beautiful balance of life is not destroyed.","The enemy of a love is never outside, it\'s not a man or a woman, it\'s what we lack in ourselves.","Before, as soon as I came home from all sorts of places I would sit down and write in my journal. Now I want to write you, talk with you... I love when you say all that happens is good, it is good. I say all that happens is wonderful. For me it is all symphonic, and I am so aroused by living - god, Henry, in you alone I have found the same swelling of enthusiasm, the same quick rising of the blood, the fullness... Before, I almost used to think there was something wrong. Everybody else seemed to have the brakes on... I never feel the brakes. I overflow. And when I feel your excitement about life flaring, next to mine, then it makes me dizzy.","I\'m restless. Things are calling me away. My hair is being pulled by the stars again.","Woman\u2019s role in creation should be parallel to her role in life. I don\u2019t mean the good earth. I mean the bad earth too, the demon, the instincts, the storms of nature. Tragedies, conflicts, mysteries are personal. Man fabricated a detachment which became fatal. Woman must not fabricate. She must descend into the real womb and expose its secrets and its labyrinths. She must describe it as the city of Fez, with its Arabian Nights gentleness, tranquility and mystery. She must describe the voracious moods, the desires, the worlds contained in each cell of it. For the womb has dreams. It is not as simple as the good earth. I believe at times that man created art out of fear of exploring woman. I believe woman stuttered about herself out of fear of what she had to say. She covered herself with taboos and veils. Man invented a woman to suit his needs. He disposed of her by identifying her with nature and then paraded his contemptuous domination of nature. But woman is not nature only.She is the mermaid with her fish-tail dipped in the unconscious.","And sometimes I believe your relentless analysis of June leaves something out, which is your feeling for her beyond knowledge, or in spite of knowledge. I often see how you sob over what you destroy, how you want to stop and just worship; and you do stop, and then a moment later you are at it again with a knife, like a surgeon.What will you do after you have revealed all there is to know about June? Truth. What ferocity in your quest of it. You destroy and you suffer. In some strange way I am not with you, I am against you. We are destined to hold two truths. I love you and I fight you. And you, the same. We will be stronger for it, each of us, stronger with our love and our hate. When you caricature and nail down and tear apart, I hate you. I want to answer you, not with weak or stupid poetry but with a wonder as strong as your reality. I want to fight your surgical knife with all the occult and magical forces of the world.","I wept because I could not believe anymore and I love to believe. I can still love passionately without believing. That means I love humanly. I wept because from now on I will weep less. I wept because I have lost my pain and I am not yet accustomed to its absence.","The drug of love was no escape, for in its coils lie latent dreams of greatness which awaken when men and women fecundate each other deeply. Something is always born of man and woman lying together and exchanging the essences of their lives. Some seed is always carried and opened in the soil of passion. The fumes of desire are the womb of man\'s birth and often in the drunkeness of caresses history is made, and science, and philosophy. For a woman, as she sews, cooks, embraces, covers, warms, also dreams that the man taking her will be more than a man, will be the mythological figure of her dreams, the hero, the discoverer, the builder....Unless she is the anonymous whore, no man enters woman with impunity, for where the seed of man and woman mingle, within the drops of blood exchanged, the changes that take place are the same as those of great flowing rivers of inheritance, which carry traits of character from father to son to grandson, traits of character as well as physical traits. Memories of experience are transmitted by the same cells which repeated the design of a nose, a hand, the tone of a voice, the color of an eye. These great flowing rivers of inheritance transmitted traits and carried dreams from port to port until fulfillment, and gave birth to selves never born before....No man and woman know what will be born in the darkness of their intermingling; so much besides children, so many invisible births, exchanges of soul and character, blossoming of unknown selves, liberation of hidden treasures, buried fantasies...","And the time came when the risk to remain tight in a bud was more painful than the risk it took to blossom.","The dream was always running ahead of me. To catch up, to live for a moment in unison, was the miracle.","I feel a little like the moon who took possession of you for a moment and then returned your soul to you. You should not love me. One ought not to love the moon. If you come too near me, I will hurt you.","You do not know what you are missing by your microscopic examination of sexual activity to the exclusion of aspects which are fuel that ignites it. Intellectual, imaginative, romantic, emotional. This is what gives sex its surprising textures, its subtle transformations, its aphrodisiac elements. You are shrinking your world of sensations. You are withering it, starving it, draining its blood.","Living never wore one so much as the effort not to live.","Each friend represents a world in us, a world possibly not born until they arrive.","We don\'t see the world as it is, we see it as we are","Things I forgot to tell you:That I love you, and that when I awake in the morning I use my intelligence to discover more ways of appreciating you.That when June comes back she will love you more because I have loved you. There are new leaves on the tip and climax of your already overrich head.That I love you.That I love you.That I love you.I have become an idiot like Gertrude Stein. That\u2019s what love does to intelligent women. They cannot write letters anymore.","And in his eyes he had the look of the cat who inspires a desire to caress but loves no one, who never feels he must respond to the impulses he arouses.","It is true that I create over and over again the same difficulties for myself in order to struggle over and over again to master them [but] to continually struggle against the same problem and to continually fail to dominate it brings a feeling of frustration and a kind of paralysis. What is necessary to life, to livingness, is to move on, in other words to move from one kind of problem to another.","Dear Collector: We hate you. Sex loses all its power and magic when it becomes explicit, mechanical, overdone, when itbecomes a mechanistic obsession. It becomes a bore. You have taught us more than anyone I know how wrong it is not to mix it with emotion, hunger, desire, lust, whims, caprices, personal ties, deeper relationships that change its color, flavor, rhythms, intensities.\\"You do not know what you are missing by your micro-scopic examination of sexual activity to the exclusion of aspects which are the fuel that ignites it. Intellectual, imaginative, romantic, emotional. This is what gives sex its surprising textures, its subtle transformations, its aphrodisiac elements. You are shrinking your world of sensations. You are withering it, starving it, draining its blood. If you nourished your sexual life with all the excitements and adventures which love injects into sensuality, you would be the most potent man in the world. The source of sexual power is curiosity, passion. You are watching its little flame die of asphyxiation. Sex does not thrive on monotony. Without feeling, inventions, moods, no surprises in bed. Sex must be mixed withtears, laughter, words, promises, scenes, jealousy, envy, all the spices of fear, foreign travel, new faces, novels, stories, dreams, fantasies, music, dancing, opium, wine. How much do you lose by this periscope at the tip of your sex, when you could enjoy a harem of distinct and never-repeated wonders? No two hairs alike, but you will not let us waste words on a description of hair; no two odors, but if we expand on this you cry Cut the poetry. No two skins with the same texture, and never the same light, temperature, shadows, never the same gesture; for a lover, when he is aroused by true love, can run the gamut of centuries of love lore. What a range,what changes of age, what variations of maturity and innocence, perversity and art . . . We have sat around for hours and wondered how you look. If you have closed your senses upon silk, light, color, odor, character, temperament, you must be by now completely shriveled up. There are so many minor senses, all running like tributaries into the mainstream of sex, nourishing it. Only the united beat of sex and heart together can create ecstasy.","I only feel close to people who arouse my energy, who make enormous demands of me, who are capable of enriching me with experience, pain, people who do not doubt my courage, or my toughness. People who do not believe me naive or innocent, but who challenge my keenest wisdom, who have the courage to treat me like a woman in spite of the fact that they are aware of my vulnerability.","The secret of a full life is to live and relate to others as if they might not be there tomorrow, as if you might not be there tomorrow. It eliminates the vice of procrastination, the sin of postponement, failed communications, failed communions. This thought has made me more and more attentive to all encounters. meetings, introductions, which might contain the seed of depth that might be carelessly overlooked. This feeling has become a rarity, and rarer every day now that we have reached a hastier and more superficial rhythm, now that we believe we are in touch with a greater amount of people, more people, more countries. This is the illusion which might cheat us of being in touch deeply with the one breathing next to us. The dangerous time when mechanical voices, radios, telephones, take the place of human intimacies, and the concept of being in touch with millions brings a greater and greater poverty in intimacy and human vision.","We don\'t see people as they are. We see people as we are.","Sex must be mixed with tears, laughter, words, promises, scenes, jealousy, envy, all the spices of fear, foreign travel, new faces, novels, stories, dreams, fantasies, music, dancing, opium, wine.","The struggle to emerge out of the past, clean of memories; the inadequacy of our hearts to cut life into separate and final portions; the pain of this constant ambivalence and interrelation of emotions; the hunger for frontiers against which we might learn as upon closed doors before we proceed forward; the struggle against diffusion, new beginnings, against finality in acts without finality or end, in our cursedly repercussive being..","In art, in history man fights his fears, he wants to live forever, he is afraid of death, he wants to work with other men, he wants to live forever. He is like a child afraid of death. The child is afraid of death, of darkness, of solitude. Such simple fears behind all the elaborate constructions. Such simple fears as hunger for light, warmth, love. Such simple fears behind the elaborate constructions of art. Examine them all gently and quietly through the eyes of a boy. There is always a human being lonely, a human being afraid, a human being lost, a human being confused. Concealing and disguising his dependence, his needs, ashamed to say: I am a simple human being in a too vast and complex world. Because of all we have discovered about a leaf...it is still a leaf. Can we relate to a leaf, on a tree, in a park, a simple leaf: green, glistening, sun-bathed or wet, or turning white because the storm is coming. Like the savage, let us look at the leaf wet or shining with sun, or white with fear of the storm, or silvery in the fog, or listless in too great heat, or falling in autumn, dying, reborn each year anew. Learn from the leaf: simplicity. In spite of all we know about the leaf: its nerve structure phyllome cellular papilla parenchyma stomata venation. Keep a human relation -- leaf, man, woman, child. In tenderness. No matter how immense the world, how elaborate, how contradictory, there is always man, woman, child, and the leaf. Humanity makes everything warm and simple. Humanity...","You are so terribly nimble, so clever. I distrust your cleverness. You make a wonderful pattern, everything is in its place, it looks convincingly clear, too clear. And meanwhile, where are you? Not on the clear surface of your ideas, but you have already sunk deeper, into darker regions, so that one only thinks one has been given all your thoughts, one only imagines you have emptied yourself in that clarity. But there are layers and layers -- you\'re bottomless, unfathomable. Your clearness is deceptive. You are the thinker who arouses most confusion in me, most doubt, most disturbance.","[in the]..curious way that my idealism has been mixed with my fatalism, so that I can possess the soul of a dreamer and that of a cynic at the same time......I possess a power of magic...[to] destroy the balance of a well-designed destiny with my diabolical mind.....","The other night we talked about literature\'s elimination of the unessential, so that we are given a concentrated \\"dose\\" of life. I said, almost indignantly, \\"That\'s the danger of it, it prepares you to live, but at the same time, it exposes you to disappointments because it gives a heightened concept of living, it leaves out the dull or stagnant moments.

Trying to live up to Dostoevskian scenes every day. And between writers there is a straining after extravagance. We incite each other to jazz-up our rhythm.","You live like this, sheltered, in a delicate world, & you believe you are living.","And the day came when the risk to remain tight in a bud was more painful than the risk it took to blossom. Life is a process of becoming, a combination of states we have to go through. Where people fail is that they wish to elect a state and remain in it. This is a kind of death. Living never wore one out so much as the effort not to live. Life is truly known only to those who suffer, lose, endure adversity and stumble from defeat to defeat.

We write to lure and enchant and console others. We write to serenade our lovers. We write to taste life twice, in the moment and in retrospection. We write, like Proust, to render all of it eternal, and to persuade ourselves that it is eternal. We write to be able to transcend our life, to reach beyond it. We write to teach ourselves to speak with others, to record the journey into the labyrinth. We write to expand our world when we feel strangled, or constricted, or lonely...When I don\u2019t write, I feel my world shrinking. I feel I am in prison. I feel I lose my fire and my color. It should be a necessity, as the sea needs to heave, and I call it breathing.","At night too, she puzzled the mystery of her desperate need of kindness. As other girls prayed for handsomeness in a lover, or for wealth, or for power, or for poetry, she had prayed fervently: let him be kind.","Why one writes is a question I can answer easily, having so often asked it of myself. I believe one writes because one has to create a world in which one can live. I could not live in any of the worlds offered to me \u2014 the world of my parents, the world of war, the world of politics. I had to create a world of my own, like a climate, a country, an atmosphere in which I could breathe, reign, and recreate myself when destroyed by living. That, I believe, is the reason for every work of art.","There is a perfection in everything that cannot be owned,","I have always been tormented by the image of multiplicity of selves. Some days I call it richness, and other days I see it as a disease, a proliferation as dangerous as cancer. My first concept about people around me was that all of them were coordinated into a WHOLE, whereas I was made up of multiple selves, of fragments. I know that I was upset as a child to discover that we had only one life. It seems to me that I wanted to compensate for this by multiplying experience. Or perhaps it always seems like this when you follow all your impulses and they take you in different directions. In any case, when I was happy, always at the beginning of a love, euphoric, I felt I was gifted for living many lives fully. It was only when I was in trouble, lost in a maze, stifled by complications and paradoxes that I was haunted or that I spoke of my \\"madness,\\" but I meant the madness of the poets.","She lacks the core of sureness, she craves admiration insatiably. She lives on reflections of herself in others\' eyes. She does not dare to be herself.","Don\'t wait for it,\\" I said. \\"Create a world, your world. Alone. Stand alone. Create. And then the love will come to you, then it comes to you. It was only when I wrote my first book that the world I wanted to live in opened to me.","The woman will sit eternally in the tall black armchair. I will be the one woman you will never have... excessive living weighs down the imagination: we will not live, we will only write and talk to swell the sails.","My first vision of earth was water veiled. I am of the race of men and women who see all things through this curtain of sea, and my eyes are the color of water.","June, you have killed my sincerity too. I will never again know who I am, what I am, what I love, what I want. Your beauty has drowned me, the core of me. You carry away with you a part of me reflected in you. When your beauty struck me, it dissolved me. Deep down, I am not different from you. I dreamed you, I wished for your existence. You are the woman I want to be. I see in you that part of me which is you. I feel compassion for your childish pride, for your trembling unsureness, your dramatization of events, your enhancing of the loves given to you. I surrender my sincerity because if I love you it means we share the same fantasies, the same madness.","I want to run out and kiss her fantastic beauty, kiss it and say, \\"You carry away with you a reflection of me, a part of me.

Trying to live up to dostoevskian scenes every day. And between writers there is a straining after extravagance. We incite each other to jazz-up our rhythm. It is amusing that, when Henry, Fred, and I talked together, we fell back into a deep naturalness. Perhaps none of us is a sensational character. Or perhaps we have no need of condiments. Henry is, in reality, mild not temperamental; gentle not eager for scenes. We may all write about sadism, masochism, the grand quignol, bubu de montparnasse (in which the highest proof of love is for a pimp to embrace his woman\'s syphilis as fervently as herself, a noblesse-oblige of the apache world), cocteau, drugs, insane asylums, house of the dead, because we love strong colors; and yet when we sit in the cafe de la place clichy, we talk about henry\'s last pages, and a chapter which was too long, and richard\'s madness. \\"One of his greatest worries,\\" said Henry, \\"was to have introduced us. He thinks you are wonderful and that you may be in danger from the \'gangster author.","There is a perfection in everything that cannot be owned.","How can I accept a limited definable self when I feel, in me, all possibilities?... I never feel the four walls around the substance of the self, the core. I feel only space. Illimitable space.","I walked into my own book, seeking peace.It was night, and I made a careless movement inside the dream; I turned too brusquely the corner and I bruised myself against my madness.","I\'m in love with New York. It matches my mood. I\'m not overwhelmed. It is the suitable scene for my ever ever heightened life. I love the proportions, the amplitude, the brilliance, the polish, the solidity. I look up at Radio City insolently and love it. It\'s all great, and Babylonian. Broadway at night. Cellophane. The newness. The vitality. True, it is only physical. But it\'s inspiring. Just bring your own contents, and you create a sparkle of the highest power. I\'m not moved, not speechless. I stand straight, tough and I meet the impact. I feel the glow and the dancing in everything. The radio music in the taxis, scientific magic, which can all be used lyrically. That\'s my last word. Give New York to a poet. He can use it. It can be poetized. Or maybe that\'s mania of mine, to poetize. I live lightly, smoothly, actively, ears or eyes wide open, alert, oiled! I feel the glow and the dancing in every thing and the tempo is like that of my blood. I\'m at once beyond, over and in New York, tasting it fully.","words carry colors and sounds into the flesh","You are the poet, you walk inside my dreams...","Women always think that when they have my shoes, my dress my hairdresser, my make-up, it will work the same way. They do not conceive of the witchcraft that is needed. They do not know that I am not beautiful but that I only appear to be at certain moments.","How do I look to him?\\" she asked herself. She got up and brought a long mirror towards the window. She stood it on the floor against a chair. Then she sat down in front of it on the rug and, facing it, slowly opened her legs. The sight was enchanting. The skin was flawless, the vulva, roseate and full. She thought it was like the gum plant leaf with its secret milk that the pressure of the finger could bring out, the odorous moisture that came like the moisture of the sea shells. So was Venus born of the sea with this little kernel of salty honey in her, which only caresses could bring out of the hidden recesses of her body.","When you trust, you are tender and delicate, but when you doubt, you are dangerous and destructive","If happiness is the absence of fever then I will never know happiness. For I am posessed by a fever for knowledge, experience and creation.","I have no fear of God, and yet fear keeps me awake at night,fear of the devil. And if I believe in the devil, I must believe in God. And if evil is abhorrent to me, I must be a saint.Henry, save me from beatification, from the horrors of static perfection. Precipitate me into the inferno.","Wherever there is light, look for the shadow. The shadow is me.","I really believe that if I were not a writer, not a creator, not an experimenter, I might have been a very faithful wife.","I like to live always at the beginnings of life, not at their end. We all lose some of our faith under the oppression of mad leaders, insane history, pathologic cruelties of daily life. I am by nature always beginning and believing and so I find your company more fruitful than that of, say, Edmund Wilson, who asserts his opinions, beliefs, and knowledge as the ultimate verity. Older people fall into rigid patterns. Curiosity, risk, exploration are forgotten by them. You have not yet discovered that you have a lot to give, and that the more you give the more riches you will find in yourself. It amazed me that you felt that each time you write a story you gave away one of your dreams and you felt the poorer for it. But then you have not thought that this dream is planted in others, others begin to live it too, it is shared, it is the beginning of friendship and love.[\u2026]You must not fear, hold back, count or be a miser with your thoughts and feelings. It is also true that creation comes from an overflow, so you have to learn to intake, to imbibe, to nourish yourself and not be afraid of fullness. The fullness is like a tidal wave which then carries you, sweeps you into experience and into writing. Permit yourself to flow and overflow, allow for the rise in temperature, all the expansions and intensifications. Something is always born of excess: great art was born of great terrors, great loneliness, great inhibitions, instabilities, and it always balances them. If it seems to you that I move in a world of certitudes, you, par contre, must benefit from the great privilege of youth, which is that you move in a world of mysteries. But both must be ruled by faith.","He had not touched me. He did not need to. His presence had affected me in such a way that I felt as if he had caressed me for a long time.","During the nuit blanche I think: Henry, my love, I can love you better now that you cannot hurt me. I can love you more gaily. More loosely. I can endure space and distance and betrayals. Only the best, the best and the strongest. Henry, my love, the wanderer, the artist, the faithless one who has loved me so well. Believe me, nothing has changed in me toward you except my courage. I cannot walk with one love ever. My head is strong, my head, but to walk, to walk into love I need miracles, the miracles of excess, and white heat, and two-ness! Lie here, breathing into my hair, over my neck. No hurt will come from me. No criticalness, no judgment. I bear you in my womb.","I feel that from the very beginning life played a terrible conjurer\u2019s trick on me. I lost faith in it. It seems to me that every moment now it is playing tricks on me. So that when I hear love I am not sure it is love, and when I hear gaiety I am not sure it is gaiety, and when I have eaten and loved and I am all warm from wine, I am not sure it is either love or food or wine, but a strange trick being played on me, an illusion, slippery and baffling and malicious, and a magician hangs behind me watching the ecstasy I feel at the things which happen so that I know deep down it is all fluid and escaping and may vanish at any moment. Don\u2019t forget to write me a letter and tell me I was here, and I saw you, and loved you, and ate with you. It is all so evanescent and I love it so much, I love it as you love the change in the days.","Even when they did not look at each other or speak to each other, he could feel a powerful current between them.","You haven\'t loved yet,\\" he said. \\"You\'ve only been trying to love; beginning to love. Trust alone is not love, illusion is not love, desire alone is not love. All these were paths leading you out of yourself, it is true, and so you thought they led to another, but you never reached the other. You were only on the way.","You are that to me, an oasis. You drug me and at the same time you give me strength.","We see things not as they are, but as we are. Because it is the \'I\' behind the \'eye\' that does the seeing.","I was always ashamed to take. So I gave. It was not a virtue. It was a disguise.","We are more severe judges of our own acts... We judge our thoughts, our intents, our secret curses, our secret hates, not only our acts.","Henry\'s recollections of the past, in contrast to Proust, are done while in movement. He may remember his first wife while making love to a whore, or he may remember his very first love while walking the streets, traveling to see a friend; and life does not stop while he remembers. Analysis in movement. No static vivisection. Henry\'s daily and continuous flow of life, his sexual activity, his talks with everyone, his cafe life, his conversations with people in the street, which I once considered an interruption to writing, I now believe to be a quality which distinguishes him from other writers. He never writes in cold blood: he is always writing in white heat.It is what I do with the journal, carrying it everywhere, writing on cafe tables while waiting for a friend, on the train, on the bus, in waiting rooms at the station, while my hair is washed, at the Sorbonne when the lectures get tedious, on journeys, trips, almost while people are talking.It is while cooking, gardening, walking, or love-making that I remember my childhood, and not while reading Freud\'s \'Preface to a Little Girl\'s Journal.","All I wanted was humor and wisdom.","This morning I got up to begin this book I coughed. Something was coming out of my throat: it was strangling me. I broke the thread which held it and yanked it out. I went back to bed and said: I have just spat out my heart.","Please understand I am in full rebellion against my own mind, that when I live, I live by impulse, by emotion, by white heat.","I have raged at the wall growing between myself and others. I expect intuitive, miraculous understanding, or else I\u2019m disillusioned and don\u2019t want to struggle to make things clear.","Pleasure is an attitude, not a person or place. \xa0 \u2014Diary 6, pg. 52","Every gesture was one of disorder and violence, as if a lioness had come into the room.","I dreamed you, I wished for your existence.","Her elongated eyes did not close as other women\'s eyes did, but like the eyes of tigers, pumas and leopards, the two lids meeting lazily and slowly; and they seemed slightly sewn together towards the nose, making them narrow, with a lascivious, oblique glance falling from them like the glance of a woman who does not want to see what is being done to her body. All this gave her an air of being made love to, which aroused the Baron as soon as he met her.","His entire body was pleading for reassurance, and if her whole love was not enough what else could she give him to cure his doubt?","If I did not move and dance between them the three would turn to stone, for they are passive [...] They would fall asleep if I lay still somewhere. Henry, Gonzalo, Hugh. [...] It is only my dancing, my dancing which animates them. I slide out of Gonzalo\'s bed like a snake. I slide out of Henry\'s bed. I slide out of Hugh\'s bed. [...]I dance untrammeled - return to each full of the space in between, that change of air. Dancing, I find my flame and my joy, because I dance, slide, run, to the boat, to quai de Passy, to Villa Seurat; I keep the wind in the folds of my dress, the rain on my hair, and light in my eyes.","He had never seen her body so abandoned, so unconscious of all but the desire to be taken and satisfied. She bloomed under his caresses, no longer the girl but the woman already being born.","\u2026For love it is never the same. What goes on inside is never the same just like this music which changes every instant. For love there are a million variations, a million nights, a million days, contrasts in moods, in textures, whims, a million gestures colored by emotion, by sorrow, joy, fear, courage, triumph, by revelations which deepen the groove, creations which expand its dimensions, sharpen its penetrations. Love is vast enough to include a phrase read in a book, the shape of a neck seen and desired in a crowd, a face loved and desired, seen in the window of a passing subway, vast enough to include a past love, a future love, a film, a voyage, a scene in a dream, an hallucination, a vision. Love-making under a tent, or under a tree, with or without a cover, under a shower, in darkness or in light, in heat or cold.","Perhaps I should not tell him the dream. It puts me in his hands, it is giving him too much,","A voice that had traversed the centuries, so heavy it broke what it touched, so heavy I feared it would ring in me with eternal resonance, a voice rusty with the sound of curses and the hoarse cries that issue from the delta in the last paroxysm of orgasm.","But I am not sure what this self is. For the moment I seem to be busy tearing down what I was.","The most haunting woman is the one we cannot find in the crowded caf\xe9 when we are looking for her, the one that we must hunt for, and seek out through the disguises of her stories.","Slowly what she composed with the new day was her own focus, to bring together body and mind. This was made with an effort, as if all the dissolutions and dispersions of her self the night before were difficult to reassemble. She was like an actress who must compose a face, an attitude to meet the day.The eyebrow pencil was no mere charcoal emphasis on blond eyebrows, but a design necessary to balance a chaotic asymmetry. Make up and powder were not simply applied to heighten a porcelain texture, to efface the uneven swellings caused by sleep, but to smooth out the sharp furrows designed by nightmares, to reform the contours and blurred surfaces of the cheeks, to erase the contradictions and conflicts which strained the clarity of the face\u2019s lines, disturbing the purity of its forms.She must redesign the face, smooth the anxious brows, separate the crushed eyelashes, wash off the traces of secret interior tears, accentuate the mouth as upon a canvas, so it will hold its luxuriant smile.Inner chaos, like those secret volcanoes which suddenly lift the neat furrows of a peacefully ploughed field, awaited behind all disorders of face, hair, and costume, for a fissure through which to explode.What she saw in the mirror now was a flushed, clear-eyed face, smiling, smooth, beautiful. The multiple acts of composure and artifice had merely dissolved her anxieties; now that she felt prepared to meet the day, her true beauty emerged which had been frayed and marred by anxiety.","The light was crude. It made Artaud\'s eyes shrink into darkness, as they are deep-set. This brought into relief the intensity of his gestures. He looked tormented. His hair, rather long, fell at times over his forehead. He has the actor\'s nimbleness and quickness of gestures. His face is lean, as if ravaged by fevers. His eyes do not seem to see the people. They are the eyes of a visionary. His hands are long, long-fingered. Beside him Allendy looks earthy, heavy, gray. He sits at the desk, massive, brooding. Artaud steps out on the platform, and begins to talk about \\" The Theatre and the Plague.\\"He asked me to sit in the front row. It seems to me that all he is asking for is intensity, a more heightened form of feeling and living. Is he trying to remind us that it was during the Plague that so many marvelous works of art and theater came to be, because, whipped by the fear of death, man seeks immortality, or to escape, or to surpass himself? But then, imperceptibly almost, he let go of the thread we were following and began to act out dying by plague. No one quite knew when it began. To illustrate his conference, he was acting out an agony. \\"La Peste\\" in French is so much more terrible than \\"The Plague\\" in English. But no word could describe what Artaud acted out on the platform of the Sorbonne. He forgot about his conference, the theatre, his ideas, Dr. Allendy sitting there, the public, the young students, his wife, professors, and directors. His face was contorted with anguish, one could see the perspiration dampening his hair. His eyes dilated, his muscles became cramped, his fingers struggled to retain their flexibility. He made one feel the parched and burning throat, the pains, the fever, the fire in the guts. He was in agony. He was screaming. He was delirious. He was enacting his own death, his own crucifixion.At first people gasped. And then they began to laugh. Everyone was laughing! They hissed. Then, one by one, they began to leave, noisily, talking, protesting. They banged the door as they left. The only ones who did not move were Allendy, his wife, the Lalous, Marguerite. More protestations. More jeering. But Artaud went on, until the last gasp. And stayed on the floor. Then when the hall had emptied of all but his small group of friends, he walked straight up to me and kissed my hand. He asked me to go to the cafe with him.","This is not to worry you, Henry, it is just that I can\u2019t keep from saying it, that I am overflowing, desperately in love with you as I never was with anyone.","Through books I discovered everything to be loved, explored, visited, communed with. I was enriched and given all the blueprints to a marvelous life, I was consoled in adversity, I was prepared for both joys and sorrows, I acquired one of the most precious sources of strength of all: an understanding of human beings, insight into their motivations.","The truth is that this is the only way I can live: in two directions. I need two lives. I am two beings. When I return to Hugo in the evening, to the peace and warmth of the house, I return with deep contentment, as if this was the only condition for me. I bring home to Hugo a whole woman, freed of all \'possessed\' fevers, cured of the poison of restlessness and curiosity which used to threaten our marriage, cured through action. Our love lives, because I live. I sustain and feed it. I am loyal to it, in my own way, which cannot be his way. If he ever reads these lines, he must believe me. I am writing calmly, lucidly while waiting for him to come home, as one waits for the chosen lover, the eternal one.","I am more interested in human beings than in writing, more interested in lovemaking than in writing, more interested in living than in writing. More interested in becoming a work of art than in creating one.","So many broken promises, each day an aborted wish, a lost object, a misplaced unread book, cluttering the room like an attic with discarded possessions.","I am like a winged creature who is too rarely allowed to use its wings. Ecstasies do not occur often enough.","I can only connect deeply or not at all.","I have always been tormented by the image of multiplicity of selves. Some days I call it richness, and other days I see it as a disease, a proliferation as dangerous as cancer. My first concept about people around me was that all of them were coordinated into a WHOLE, whereas I was made up of a multitude of selves, of fragments.","Our love would be death. The embrace of imaginings.","I am apparently gentle, unstable, and full of pretenses. I will die a poet killed by the nonpoets, will renounce no dream, resign myself to no ugliness, accept nothing of the world but the one I made myself. I wrote, lived, loved like Don Quixote, and on the day of my death I will say: \u2018Excuse me, it was all a dream,\u2019 and by that time I may have found one who will say: \u2018Not at all, it was true, absolutely true.","The potion drunk by lovers is prepared by no one but themselves. The potion is the sum of one\'s whole existence.","I would not be concerned with the secrets, the lies, the mysteries, the facts. I would be concerned with what makes them necessary. What fear.","The potion drunk by lovers is prepared by no one but themselves. The potion is the sum of one\'s whole existence. Every word spoken in the past accumulated forms and color in the self. What flows through the veins besides blood is the distillation of every act committed, the sediment of all the visions, wishes, dreams, and experiences. All the past emotions converge to tint the skin and flavor the lips, to regulate the pulse and produce crystals in the eyes.The fascination exerted by one human being over another is not what he emits of his personality at the present instant of encounter but a summation of his entire being which gives off this powerful drug capturing the fancy and attachment.No moment of charm without long roots in the past, no moment of charm is born on bare soil, a careless accident of beauty, but is the sum of great sorrows, growths, and efforts.But love, the great narcotic, was the hothouse in which all the selves burst into their fullest bloom . . .","-You know I\'ve always wanted to break the molds which life forms around one if one lets them.-Why?-I want to trespass boundaries, erase all identifications, anything which fixes one permanently into one mold, one place, without hope of change.","Yes, it is you, and I am in love with you and I am going to be frank with you, brutally frank, because when you have an equal you can afford to be frank.","It is the function of art to renew our perception. What we are familiar with, we cease to see.","Hell is a different place for each man, or each man has his own particular hell. My descent into the inferno is a descent into the irrational level of existence, where the instincts and blind emotions are loose, where one lives by pure impulse, pure fantasy, and therefore pure madness. No, that is not the inferno.","And it is that which draws me to you, too, for you are the tropics, you have the sun in you, and the softness and the clarity...","Does she know I feel immobile and fixed, lost in her?","If a person continues to see only giants, it means he is still looking at the world through the eyes of a child.","I am caught. And he? What does he feel? I am invaded, I lose everything, my mind vacillates, I am only aware of sensation.","Love the great narcotic was the revealer in the alchemist\'s bottle rendering visible the most untraceable substances. Love the great narcotic was the agent provocateur exposing all the secret selves to daylight.","When you\'re in my arms, I know you\'re mine. But your feet are so swift, so swift, they carry you as lightly as wings, I never know where, too fast, too fast away from me.","The magic beauty of simultaneity, to see the loved one rushing toward you at the same moment you are rushing toward him, the magic power of meeting, exactly at midnight to achieve union, the illusion of one common rhythm achieved by overcoming obstacles, deserting friends, breaking other bonds - all this was soon dissolved by his laziness, by his habit of missing every moment, of never keeping his word, of living perversely in a state of chaos, of swimming more naturally in a sea of failed intentions, broken promises, and aborted wishes","The theme of the diary is always the personal, but it does not mean only a personal story: it means a personal relationship to all things and people. The personal, if it is deep enough, becomes universal, mythical, symbolic; I never generalize, intellectualise. I see, I hear, I feel. These are my primitive elements of discovery.Music, dance, poetry and painting are the channels for emotion. It is through them that experience penetrates our bloodstream.","But what a superb game the three of us are playing. Who is the demon? Who is the liar? Who the human being? Who the cleverest? Who the strongest? Who loves the most? Are we three immense egos fighting for domination or for love, or are these things mixed?","The inner hatreds of men are now projected outside. There are fights in the streets. Revolutions in France, they say. Men did not seek to resolve their own personal revolutions, so now they act them out collectively.","In you alone I have found the same swelling of enthusiasm, the same quick rising of the blood, the fullness\u2026 Before, I almost used to think there was something wrong. Everybody else seemed to have the brakes on\u2026 I never feel the brakes. I overflow. And when I feel your excitement about life flaring, next to mine, then it makes me dizzy.","Men can be in love with literary figures, with poetic and mythological figures, but let them meet with Artemis, with Venus, with any of the goddesses of love, and then they start hurling moral judgments.","We must avoid possession,\\" he said. \\"But, oh, let me kiss you.","By beginning a diary, I was already conceding that life would be more bearable if I looked at it as an adventure and a tale. I was telling myself the story of a life, and this transmutes into an adventure the things which can shatter you.","The humiliations and defeats,given with a primitive honesty,end not in frustration, despair or futility,but in hunger, an ecstatic devouring hunger\u2014for more life.- Anais Nin\u201d","I know that I go through life like a drunkard. I\'m drunk on illusion. But no matter how drunk I am, there are things I can\'t help seeing, ferociously real things. I close my eyes, and I reel, I reel. I reel, I believe, I live in a fever and turmoil, I rise into ecstasy, but all the time there is the face of reality staring at me with ugly eyes. I know that if I open my eyes I will be intolerably hurt by the ugliness.","A writer, who was a celebrity in Paris, had entered her shop one day. He was not looking for a hat. He asked if she sold luminous flowers that he had heard about, flowers which shone in the dark. He wanted them, he said, for a woman who shone in the dark. He could swear that when he took her to the theatre and she sat back in the dark loges in her evening dress, her skin was as luminous as the finest of sea shells, with a pale pink glow to it. And he wanted these flowers for her to wear in her hair.","As June walked toward me from the darkness of the garden into the light of the door, I saw for the first time the most beautiful woman on earth. Astartling white face, burning dark eyes, a face so alive I felt it would consume itself before my eyes. Years ago I tried to imagine a true beauty; I created in my mind an image of just such a woman. I had never seen her until last night. Yet I knew long ago the phosphorescent color of her skin, her huntress profile, the evenness of her teeth. She is bizarre, fantastic, nervous, like someone in a high fever. Her beauty drowned me... By the end of the evening I had extricated myself from her power. She killed my admiration by her talk. Her talk. The enormous ego, false, weak, posturing. She lacks the courage of her personality, which is sensual, heavy with experience. Her role alone preoccupies her. She invents drama in which she always stars. I am sure she creates genuine dramas, genuine chaos and whirlpools of feelings, but I feel that her share in it is a pose. That night, in spite of my response to her, she sought to be whatever she felt I wanted her to be. She is an actress every moment. I cannot grasp the core of June.","I said, \\"If there is an explanation of the mystery, it is this: the love between women is a refuge and an escape into harmony and narcissism in place of conflict.","I would tell him how he almost made us lose interest in passion by his obsession with the gestures empty of their emotions, and how we reviled him, because he almost caused us to take vows of chastity, because what he wanted us to exclude was our own aphrodisiac\u2014poetry.","I\'m neurotic--in the sense that I live in my world. I will not adjust myself to the world. I am adjusted to myself.","We may seem to forget a person, a place, a state of being, a past life, but meanwhile what we are doing is selecting new actors, seeking the closest reproduction to the friend, the lover, the husband we are trying to forget, in order to re-enact the drama with understudies. And one day we open our eyes and there we are, repeating the same story. How could it be otherwise? The design comes from within us. It is internal. It is what the old mystics described as karma, repeated until the spiritual or emotional experience was understood, liquidated, achieved.","Over and over again I sail towards joy, which is never in the room with me, but always near me, across the way, like those rooms full of gayety one sees from the street, or the gayety in the street one sees from a window. Will I ever reach joy? It hides behind the turning merry-go-round of the traveling circus. As soon as I approach it, it is no longer joy. Joy is a foam, an illumination. I am poorer and hungrier for the want of it. When I am in the dance, joy is outside in the elusive garden. When I am in the garden, I hear it exploding from the house. When I am traveling, joy settles like an aurora borealis over the land I leave. When I stand on the shore I see it bloom on the flag of a departing ship. What joy? Have I not possessed it? I want the joy of simple colours, street organs, ribbons, flags, not a joy that takes my breath away and throws me into space alone where no one else can breathe with me, not the joy that comes from a lonely drunkenness. There are so many joys, but I have only known the ones that come like a miracle, touching everything with light.","The physical as a symbol of the spiritual world. The people who keep old rags, old useless objects, who hoard, accumulate: are they also keepers and hoarders of old ideas, useless information, lovers of the past only, even in its form of detritus?\u2026I have the opposite obsession. In order to change skins, evolve into new cycles, I feel one has to learn to discard. If one changes internally, one should not continue to live with the same objects. They reflect one\u2019s mind and psyche of yesterday. I throw away what has no dynamic, living use. I keep nothing to remind me of the passage of time, deterioration, loss, shriveling.","Our talks are wonderful, interplays, not duels but swift illuminations of one another. I can make his tentative thoughts click. He enlarges mine. I fire him. He makes me flow. There is always movement between us. And he is grasping. He takes hold of me like a prey.","She was now afraid to yield to passion, and because she could not yield to the larger impulses it became essential also to not yield to the small ones, even if her adversary were in the right. She was living on a plane of war. The bigger resistance to the flow of life became one with the smaller resistance to the will of others, and the smallest issue became equal to the ultimate one. The pleasure of yielding on a level of passion being unknown to her, the pleasure of yielding on other levels became equally impossible. She denied herself all the sources of feminine pleasure: of being invaded, of being conquered. In war, conquest was imperative. No approach from the enemy could be interpreted as anything but a threat. She could not see that the real issue of the war was a defense of her being against the invasion of passion. Her enemy was the lover who might possess her. All her intensity was poured into the small battles; to win in the choice of a restaurant, of a movie, of visitors, in opinions, in analysis of people, to win in all the small rivalries through an evening.","I always run away from the simplest phrases because they never contain all of the truth. To me the truth is something which cannot be told in a few words, and those who simplify the universe only reduce the expansion of its meaning.","Why is that I never get cut off from pity, sympathy, participation, in spite of the fact that I am living out of my own dream, my interior vision, my fantasies without any interruptions. I dream, I kiss, I have orgasms, I get exalted, I leave the world, I float, I cook, I sew, have nightmares, write in my head, compose, decompose, improvise, invent, I listen to all, I hear all that is said, I feel Spain, I am aware, I am everywhere , I am open to wounds, open to love, I am rooted to my devotions, I am never separete, I am never cut off, never blind, deaf, absent. I hold on to the dream which makes life possible, to the creation which transfigures, to the God who sustains, to the crimes which gave life, to the illusions which makes the marvelous possible. I hold on to the poetry and the human simplicities.","I walk ahead of myself in perpetual expectancyof miracles.","You must not fear, hold back, count or be a miser with your thoughts and feelings. It is also true that creation comes from an overflow, so you have to learn to intake, to imbibe, to nourish yourself and not be afraid of fullness. The fullness is like a tidal wave which then carries you, sweeps you into experience and into writing. Permit yourself to flow and overflow, allow for the rise in temperature, all the expansions and intensifications. Something is always born of excess: great art was born of great terrors, great loneliness, great inhibitions, instabilities, and it always balances them. If it seems to you that I move in a world of certitudes, you, par contre, must benefit from the great privilege of youth, which is that you move in a world of mysteries. But both must be ruled by faith.","Why one writes is a question I can answer easily, having so often asked it of myself. I believe one writes because one has to create a world in which one can live. I could not live in any of the worlds offered to me \u2014 the world of my parents, the world of war, the world of politics. I had to create a world of my own, like a climate, a country, an atmosphere in which I could breathe, reign, and recreate myself when destroyed by living. That, I believe, is the reason for every work of art. The artist is the only one who knows the world is a subjective creation, that there is a choice to be made, a selection of elements. It is a materialization, an incarnation of his inner world. Then he hopes to attract others into it, he hopes to impose this particular vision and share it with others. When the second stage is not reached, the brave artist continues nevertheless. The few moments of communion with the world are worth the pain, for it is a world for others, an inheritance for others, a gift to others, in the end. When you make a world tolerable for yourself, you make a world tolerable for others.We also write to heighten our own awareness of life, we write to lure and enchant and console others, we write to serenade our lovers. We write to taste life twice, in the moment and in retrospection.. We write, like Proust, to render all of it eternal, and to persuade ourselves that it is eternal. We write to be able to transcend our life, to reach beyond it. We write to teach ourselves to speak with others, to record the journey into the labyrinth, we write to expand our world, when we feel strangled, constricted, lonely. We write as the birds sing. As the primitive dance their rituals. If you do not breathe through writing, if you do not cry out in writing, or sing in writing, then don\'t write. Because our culture has no use for any of that. When I don\'t write I feel my world shrinking. I feel I am in prison. I feel I lose my fire, my color. It should be a necessity, as the sea needs to heave. I call it breathing.","Every word spoken in the past accumulated forms and colors in the self. What flows through the veins besides blood is the distillation of every act committed, the sediment of all the visions, wishes, dreams and experiences. All the past emotions converge to tint the skin and flavor the lips, to regulate the pulse and produce crystals in the eyes.","We\'re journeying constantly, but there is always a machine and books, and your body is always close to me and the look in your eyes never changes. People are saying we will be miserable, we will regret, but we are happy, we are laughing always, we are singing. We are talking Spanish and French and","You loved a man who treated you like absinthe, half poison and half god.","In this instant of danger they realized they were each other\'s reason for living, and into this instant they threw their whole being.","The symptoms of hibernating are easily detectable: first, restlessness. The second symptom (when hibernating becomes dangerous and might degenerate into death): absence of pleasure. That is all. It appears like an innocuous illness. Monotony, boredom, death. Millions live like this (or die like this) without knowing it. They work in offices. They drive a car. They picnic with their families. They raise children. And then some shock treatment takes place, a person, a book, a song, and it awakens them and saves them from death.","I see ashes under the skin of her face. Disintegration. What terrible anxiety I feel. I want to put my arms around her. I feel her receding into death and I am willing to enter death to follow her, to embrace her. She is dying before my eyes. Her tantalizing, somber beauty is dying. Her strange, manlike strength.","We see the world not as it is, but as we are.","Jazz is the music of the body. The breath comes through brass. It is the body\u2019s breath, and the strings\u2019 wails and moans are echoes of the body\u2019s music. It is the body\u2019s vibrations which ripple from the fingers. And the mystery of the withheld theme, known to jazz musicians alone, is like the mystery of our secret life. We give to others only peripheral improvisations.","[Fall, 1951]To me Acapulco is the detoxicating cure for all the evils of the city: ambition, vanity, quest for success in money, the continuous contagious presence of power-driven, obsessed individuals who want to become known, to be in the limelight, noticed, as if life among millions gave you a desperate illness, a need of rising above the crowd, being noticed, existing individually, singled out from a mass of ants and sheep. It has something to do with the presence of millions of anonymous faces, anonymous people, and the desperate ways of achieving distinction. Here, all this is nonsense. You exist by your smile and your presence. You exist for your joys and your relaxations. You exist in nature. You are part of the glittering sea, and part of the luscious, well-nourished plants, you are wedded to the sun, you are immersed in timelessness, only the present counts, and from the present you extract all the essences which can nourish the senses, and so the nerves are still, the mind is quiet, the nights are lullabies, the days are like gentle ovens in which infinitely wise sculptor\u2019s hands re-form the lost contours, the lost sensations of the body. The body comes to life. Quests, pursuits of concrete securities of one kind or another lose all their importance. As you swim, you are washed of all the excrescences of so-called civilization, which includes the incapacity to be happy under any circumstances.","I am losing my great, dissolving, disintegrating pity for others, in which I saw deflected the compassion I wanted for myself. I no longer give compassion, which means I no longer need to receive it.","When we walked together through the streets, bodies close together, arm in arm, hands locked, I could not talk. We were walking over the world, over reality, into ecstasy. When she smelled my handkerchief, she inhaled me. When I clothed her beauty, I possessed her.","Sex loses all its power and magic when it becomes explicit, mechanical, overdone, when it becomes a mechanistic obsession. It becomes a bore. You have taught us more than anyone I know how wrong it is not to mix it with emotion, hunger, desire, lust, whims, caprices, personal ties, deeper relationships that change its color, flavor, rhythms, intensities.","At five o\'clock Paris always has a current of eroticism in the air.","We are punctual, a stressed, marked characteristic. We need order around us, in the house, in the life, although we live by irresistible impulses, as if the order in the closets, in our papers, in our books, in our photographs, in our souvenirs, in our clothes could preserve us from chaos in our feelings, loves, in our work. Indifference to food, sobriety; but this, we admit, is the part of the war against a threatening fragility.","It was this that frightened me--the sense that behind the grande amoureuse lay concealed a little bourgeoise who wanted security in love.","I feel very small. I don\u2019t understand. I have so much courage, fire, energy, for many things, yet I get so hurt, so wounded by small things.","...human beings place upon an object, or a person, this responsibility of being the obstacle when the obstacle lies always within one\'s self.","I want to do things so wild with you that I don\u2019t know how to say them.","I was sure the old man knew nothing about the beatitudes, ecstasies, dazzling reverberations of sexual encounters. Cut out the poetry was his message. Clinical sex, deprived of all the warmth of love\u2014the orchestration of all the senses, touch, hearing, sight, palate; all the euphoric accompaniments, back-ground music, moods, atmosphere, variations\u2014forced him to resort to literary aphrodisiacs.","I really believe that if I were not a writer, not a creator, not an experimenter, I might have been a very faithful wife. I think highly of faithfulness. But my temperament belongs to the writer, not to the woman. Such a separation may seem childish, but it is possible. Subtract the overintensity, the sizzling of ideas, and you get a woman who loves perfection. And faithfulness is one of the perfections. It seems stupid and unintelligent to me now because I have bigger plans in mind. Perfection is static, and I am in full progress. The faithful wife is only one phase, one moment, one metamorphosis, one condition.","By the end of the evening I was like a man, terribly in love with her face and body, which promised so much, and I hated the self created in her by others. Others feel because of her; and because of her, others write poetry; because of her, others hate; others, like Henry, love her in spite of themselves.","Djuna had wanted a life of desire and freedom, not luxury but beauty, not security but fulfillment, not perfection but a perfect moment like this one...","You don\u2019t know how I marvel at your ability to absorb quickly and then turn about, rain down the spears, nail it, penetrate it, envelop it with your intellect.","I watched life and wanted to be a part of it but found it painfully difficult.","Every lover could be brought to trial as the murderer of his own love. When something hurts you, saddens you, I rush to avoid it, to alter it, to feel as you do, but you turn away with a gesture of impatience and say: \\"I don\'t understand","you are a narcissist. That is the raison d\xeatre of the journal. Journal writing is a disease. But it\'s all right. It\'s very interesting. I don\'t know of any journal more interesting. I don\'t know of any woman writing so frankly.","The old concept of chronological, orderly, symmetrical development of character died when it was discovered that the unconscious motivations are entirely at odds with fabricated conventions. Human beings do not grow in perfect symmetry. They oscillate, expand, contract, backtrack, arrest themselves, retrogress, mobilize, atrophy in part, proceed erratically according to experience and traumas. Some aspects of the personality mature, others do not. Some live in the past, some in the present. Some people are futuristic characters, some are cubistic, some are hard-edged, some geometric, some abstract, some impressionistic, some surrealistic!","No, this was a melting together, a vanishing together into a soft, dark womb of warmth.","Last night I wept. I wept because the process by which I have become a woman was painful. I wept because I was no longer a child with a child\'s blind faith. I wept because my eyes were opened to reality - to Henry\'s selfishness, June\'s love of power, my insatiable creativity which must concern itself with other and cannot be sufficient to itself. I wept because I could not believe anymore and I love to believe. I can still love passionately without believing. That means I love humanly. I wept because from now on I will weep less. I wept because I have lost my pain and I am not yet accustomed to its absence.","When he first stepped out of the car and walked towards the door where I stood waiting, I saw a man I liked. In his writing he is flamboyant, virile, animal, magnificent. He\'s a man whom life makes drunk, I thought. He is like me.","Like the Baron, Mathilde developed a formula for acting out life as a series of roles\u2014that is, by saying to herself in the morning while brushing her blond hair, \\"Today I want to become this or that person,\\" and then proceeding to be that person.One day she decided she would like to be an elegant representative of a well-known Parisian modiste and go to Peru. All she had to do was to act the role. So she dressed with care, presented herself with extraordinary assurance at the house of the modiste, was engaged to be her representative and given a boat ticket to Lima.Aboard ship, she behaved like a French missionary of elegance. Her innate talent for recognizing good wines, good perfumes, good dressmaking, marked her as a lady of refinement.","You make me think of Casanova, except that in between the erotic, Casanova was boring, while you, in between eroticism and even because of it, you get profound.","Around her hair there was a saffron aureole, and her skin was a sea shell...","He never treated her as a wife. He wooed her over and over again, with presents, flowers, new pleasures.","Man is always trying to create a woman who will fill his needs, and that makes her untrue to herself.","No man and woman know what will be born in the darkness of their intermingling; so much besides children, so many invisible births, exchanges of soul and character, blossoming of unknown selves, liberation of hidden treasures, buried fantasies...","There are women\u2019s voices that sound like poetic, unearthly echoes. Then they change. The eyes change. I believe that all these legends about people changing into animals at night \u2013 like the stories of the werewolf, for instance \u2013 were invented by men who saw women transformed at night \u2013 from idealized, worshipful creatures into animals and thought that they were possessed.","At sixteen Sabina took moon baths, first of all because everyone else took sun baths, and second, she admitted, because she had been told it was dangerous. The effect of moon baths was unknown, but it was intimated that it might be the opposite of the sun\u2019s effect. The first time she exposed herself she was frightened. What would the consequences be?","\u0627\u0644\u062d\u064a\u0627\u0629 \u0627\u0644\u0627\u0639\u062a\u064a\u0627\u062f\u064a\u0629 \u0644\u0627 \u062a\u0631\u0648\u0642 \u0644\u064a\u060c \u0625\u0646\u0646\u064a \u0623\u062a\u0648\u0642 \u0625\u0644\u0649 \u0627\u0644\u0644\u062d\u0638\u0627\u062a \u0627\u0644\u062e\u0627\u0631\u0642\u0629 \u0643\u0645\u0627 \u0627\u0644\u0633\u0648\u0631\u064a\u0627\u0644\u064a\u064a\u0646 \u0641\u064a \u0646\u0634\u062f\u0627\u0646\u0647\u0645 \u0627\u0644\u063a\u0631\u0627\u0628\u0629.","It is right that you should read according to your temperament, occupations, hobbies, and vocations. But it is a sign of great inner insecurity to be hostile to the unfamiliar, unwilling to explore the unfamiliar. In science, we respect the research worker. In literature, we should not always read the books blessed by the majority.","When life becomes too difficult, I turn to my work. I swim into a new region.","In the world of the dreamer there was solitude: all the exaltations and joys came in the moment of preparation for living. They took place in solitude. But with action came anxiety, and the sense of insuperable effort made to match the dream, and with it came weariness, discouragement, and the flight into solitude again. And then in solitude, in the opium den of remembrance, the possibility of pleasure again. What was she seeking to salvage from the daily current of living, what sudden revulsions drove her back into the solitary cell of the dream?","I\'m putting back into the self the responsibility for the collective life. If each one of us took very seriously the fact that every little act, every little word we utter, every injury we do to another human being is really what is projected into larger issues; if we could once begin to think of it that way, then each one of us, like a small cell, would do the work of creating a human self, a kind of self who wouldn\'t have ghettos, a kind of self that wouldn\'t go to war. Then we could begin to have the cell which would influence and enormous amount of cells around you. I don\'t think we can measure the radius of the personal influence of one person, within the home, outside of the home, in the neighborhood, and finally in national affairs.","Se vive as\xed, cobijado en un mundo delicado, y uno cree que vive.

Women from all over the world smiled at them from open windows, stood on the doorsteps inviting them in. Some of the rooms were exposed to the street. Only a curtain concealed the beds. One could see couples embracing. There were Syrian women wearing their native costume, Arabian women with jewelry covering their half-naked bodies, Japanese and Chinese women beckoning slyly, big African women squatting in circles, chatting together. One house was filled with French whores wearing short pink chemises and knitting and sewing as if they were at home. They always hailed the passers-by with promises of specialities. The houses were small, dimly lit, dusty, foggy with smoke, filled with dusky voices, the murmurs of drunkards, of lovemaking. The Chinese adorned the setting and made it more confused with screens and curtains, lanterns, burning incense, Buddhas of gold. It was a maze of jewels, paper flowers, silk hangings, and rugs, with women as varied as the designs and colors, inviting men who passed by to sleep with them.","I have created myself a soul, big as the world, that leaks all over, and I have to keep calling for the plumber.","It is hard for me to believe in continuous, sustained happiness, just as it is hard for me to believe in love.","says he is afraid of me because I am the kind of woman who leaves scars.","I never lose sight of the whole.

His theater was the clouds, where no spectacle repeated itself.","I don\'t want you to taint that fragile coat of astonishing colors created by my illusions, which no painter has ever been able to reproduce. Strange, isn\'t it, that no chemical will give a human being the iridescence that illusions give them?","Ana\xefs, I could stay here all night writing you. I see you before me constantly, with your head down and your long lashes lying on your cheeks. And I feel very humble.","Love reduces the complexity of living. It amazes me that when Henry walks towards the cafe table where I wait for him, or opens the gate to our house, the sight of him is sufficient to exult me.

There, on request, she knelt before a man, unbuttoned his pants, took his penis in her jeweled hands, and with a neatness of touch, an expertness, a subtlety few women had ever developed, sucked at it until he was satisfied. Her two hands were as active as her mouth. The titillation almost deprived each man of his senses. The elasticity of her hands; the variety of rhythms; the change from a hand grip of the entire penis to the lightest touch of the tip of it,","I have such a fear of finding another like myself, and such a desire to find one.

I could always improve on the facts.[...] in self-defense, I accuse the writers of fairy-tales. Not hunger, not cruelty, not my parents, but these tales which promised that sleeping in the snow never caused pneumonia, that bread never turned stale, that trees blossomed out of season, that dragons could be killed with courage, that intense wishing would be followed immediately by fulfillment of the wish. Intrepid wishing, said the fairytales, was more effective than labor. The smoke issuing from Aladdin\'s lamp was my first smokescreen, and the lies learned from fairytales were my first perjuries.

We could not believe that the tunnel would open on daylight: we feared to be trapped into darkness again; we feared to return whence we had come, from darkness and night. The tunnel would narrow and taperdown as we walked; it would close around us, and close tighter and tighter around us and stifle us.

The timid ones wrote about orgies. The frigid ones about frenzied fulfill-ments. The most poetic ones indulged in pure bestiality and the purest ones in perversions. We were haunted by the marvelous tales we could not tell.

We think everything is either-or, black or white: we are caught between them and we lose all our energy in the conflicts. My answer, later on in maturity, was to do them all. Not to exclude any, not to make a choice. I wanted to be everything. And I took everything in, and the more you take in, the more strength you find waiting to accomplish things and to expand your life, instead of the other (which is what we have been taught to do) which is to look for structure and to fear change, above all to fear change. Now I didn\'t fear change.","You must not fear or hold back, count or be a miser with your thoughts and your feelings. It is also true that creation comes from an overflow, so you have to learn to intake, to imbibe, to receive, to nourish yourself, and not be afraid of fullness. The fullness is like a tidal wave which then carries you, sweeps you into experience and writing. Permit yourself to flow and overflow. Allow for the rise in temperature and all the expansions and intensifications. Something is always born of excess. Great art was born of great terror, great loneliness, great inhibitions, instabilities, and it always balances them.","It is part of her beauty, this quality of being not quite there, dreamlike.","I\'m talking about equalizing the pressure between outer actions and events which are shattering and devastating to us and then the place where we recompose and reconstruct ourselves, where we finally achieve what Jung called the second birth. The second birth is the one that you can make, and the discovery of that to me was always a great relief. As long as we expect the changes to come only from the outside or from action outside or from political systems, then we are bound to feel helpless, to feel sometimes that reality is bigger and stronger than we are. But if suddenly we begin to feel that there is one person we can change, simultaneously we change many people around us. And as a writer I suddenly discovered the enormous radius of influence that one person can have.","He sat before a note book of blank pages, saying: I swallow my own words. I chew and chew everything until it deteriorates. Every thought or impulse I have is chewed into nothingness. I want to capture all my thoughts at once, but they run in all directions. If I could do this I would be capturing the nimblest of minds, like a shoal of minnows. I would reveal innocence and duplicity, generosity and calculation, fear and cowardice and courage. I want to tell the whole truth, but I cannot tell the whole truth because I would have to write four pages at once, like four columns simultaneously, four pages to the present one, and so I do not write at all. I would have to write backwards, retrace my steps constantly to catch the echoes and overtones.","Laughter and tears are not separate experiences, with intervals of rest: they rush out together and it is like walking with a sword between your legs.","A long time ago,\\" said Michael, \\"I decided never to fall in love again.

Significance stares at me from everywhere, like a gigantic underlying ghostliness. Significance emerges out of dank alleys and sombre faces, leans out of the windows of strange houses. I am constantly reconstructing a pattern of something forever lost and which I cannot forget. I catch the odors of the past on street corners and I am aware of the men who will be born tomorrow. Behind windows there are enemies or worshippers. Never neutrality or passivity. Always intention and premeditation. Even stones have for me druidical expressions.","Now, his hair is white and he no longer understands anyone\'s need to love, for he has lost everything, not to love, but to his games of love; and when you love as a game, you lose everything, as he lost his home and wife, and now he clings to me, afraid of loss, afraid of solitude.","Ana\xefs Nin noted in her diary: \u201cThe same thing which makes Henry indestructible is what makes me indestructible: It is that at the core of us is a writer, not a human being.","Men from the mountains always dream of the sea, and above all things I love to travel.","Life is a process of becoming, a combination of states we have to go through.

It is impossible that such a body should have a sex. You have the body of an angel. The anger swept over Fay like a fever, an anger at his moving his penis away from her hand. She sat up, her hair wild about her shoulders, and said, \u201cI am not an angel, Albert. I am a woman. I want you to love me as a woman.\u201d","What you call your lies are fiction and myths. The art of creating a disguise can be as beautiful as the creation of a painting\u2026 I created a woman for my artist life, bold, gay, courageous, generous, fearless; and another to please my father, a clear-sighted woman with a love of beauty, harmony, and self-discipline, critical and selective; and still another who lives in chaos, embraces the weak and the stumbling and the confused.","This is my essential reason for writing, not for fame, not to be celebrated after death, but to heighten and create life all around me... I also write because when I am writing I reach the high moment of fusion sought by the mystics, the poets, the lovers, a sense of communion with the universe.","His body smelled like a precious-wood forest; his hair, like sandalwood, his skin, like cedar. It was as if he had always lived among trees and plants.","I will let you carry me into the fecundity of destruction. I choose a body then, a face, a voice. I become you. And you become me. Silence the sensational course of your body and you will see me, intact, your own fears, your own pities. You will see love which was excluded from the passions given you, and I will see the passions excluded from love. Step out of your role and rest yourself on the core of your true desires. Cease for a moment your violent deviations. Relinquish the furious indomitable strain.I will take them up.","Her presence had awakened in him a man suddenly whipped by his earlier ideals, whose lost manhood wanted to assert itself in action.","She wanted to be where she could not see herself. She wanted to be where everything did not happen twice. She walked, following the deep caverns of diminishing light. She touched ice and was bruised. To watch she must pause, and so what she caught was never the truth - the woman panting, dancing, weeping - it was only the woman who paused. The mirror was always one breath too late to catch the breathing.","Whereas by desiring someone who would not desire her, she could allow this fire to burn and feel: how alive I am! I am capable of desire.","I guess I am disturbed only because so little strains through the meshes and I am thinking in such violent floods.","I love her for what she has dared to be, for her hardness, her cruelty, her egoism, her perverseness, her demoniac destructiveness. She would crush me to ashes without hesitation. She is a personality created to the limit. I worship her courage to hurt, and I am willing to be sacrificed to it.

I am a tyrant.","Since that talk with Henry, when I admitted more than I had ever admitted to myself, my life has altered and become deformed. The restlessness which was vague and nameless has become intolerably clear. Here is where it stabs me, at the center of the most perfect, the most steadfast structure, marriage. When this shakes, then my whole life crumbles. My love for Hugo has become fraternal. I look almost with horror at this change, which is not sudden, but slow in appearing on the surface. I had closed my eyes to all the signs. Above all, I dreaded admitting that I didn\'t want Hugo\'s passion. I had counted on the ease with which I would distribute my body. But it is not true. It was never true. When I rushed towards Henry, it was all Henry. I am frightened because I have realized the full extent of my imprisonment. Hugo has sequestered me, fostered my love of solitude. I regret now all those years when he gave me nothing but his love and I turned into myself for the rest. Starved, dangerous years.I should break up my whole life, and I cannot do it. My life is not as important as Hugo\'s, and Henry doesn\'t need me because he has June. But whatever in me has grown outside and beyond Hugo will go on.","To capture the drama of the unconscious, one had to start with the key, and the key was the dream. But the novelist\u2019s task was to pursue this dream, to unravel its meaning; the goal was to reach the relation of dream to life; the suspense was in finding this which led to a deeper significance of our acts.","Archaeologists of the soul never return empty-handed.","I am eleven years old, I know, and I am not serious enough. Last night I said to myself: tomorrow I will be good. Good? I wasn\'t any better than I was the day before. Now here is a new month, and I haven\'t yet thought out how to be more sensible, how to master my impulses and my temper. I am ashamed to be so undisciplined.","Why does a gesture, a walk, stir your blood? What a mystery this is, desire. The love sickness, the sensitivity, the obsession, the flutter of the heart, the ebb and flow of the blood. There is no drug and no alcohol to equal it.","I stress the expansion and elaboration of language. In simplifying it, reducing it, we reduce the power of our expression and our power to communicate. Standardization, the use of worn-out formulas, impedes communication because it does not match the subtlety of our minds or emotions, the multimedia of our unconscious life.","Wir sehen die Dinge nicht, wie sie sind,wir sehen sie so, wie wir sind.","They smiled at each other. His smile, even at night was dazzling; hers, too. They could scarcely distinguish anything but the brilliant smiles and the outlines of their perfect bodies.","I gave away my mystery, knowing I shouldn\'t, yet incapable of anything else.","Man needs reality, and woman illusion.

He cut into the faith with negligent scissors, and she mended and sewed and rewove and patched. He wasted, and threw away, and could not evaluate or preserve, or contain, or keep his treasures. Like his ever torn pockets, everything slipped through and was lost, as he lost gifts, mementos--all the objects from the past. She sewed his pockets that he might keep some of their days together, hold together the key to the house, to their room, to their bed. She sewed the sleeve so he could reach out his arm and hold her, when loneliness dissolved her. She sewed the lining so that the warmth would not seep out of their days together, the soft inner skin of their relationship.","Last night I wept.

For nothing in the dreams took the place of the human warmth I had witnessed. Now I felt utterly poor, because I could not create a human companion.This hunger which had inhabited her entire being, which had thinned her blood, transpired through her bones, attacked the roots of her hair, given a fragility to her skin which was never to disappear entirely, had been so enormous that it had marked her whole being and her eyes with an indelible mark. Although her life changed and every want was filled later, this appearance of hunger remained. As if nothing could ever quite fill it. Her being had received no sun, no food, no air, no warmth, no love. It retained open pores of yearning and longing, mysterious spongy cells of absorption. The space between actuality, absolute deprivation, and the sumptuosity of her imagination could never be entirely covered. What she had created in the void, in the emptiness, in the bareness continued to shame all that was offered her, and her large, infinitely blue eyes continued to assert the immensity of her hunger.","Out of worship and out of love he would let no one light the stove for her either, as if he would be the warmth and the fire to dry and warm her feet.","am discovering her pretenses.

And whenever something is said to you, you will look in my little dictionary to make sure, before you get desperate, that you have understood what is said to you.","Her lack of confidence in life, in realization, in the fulfillment of her desires, in the outcome of a dream, in the possibility of reality corresponding to her fantasy, speeded her bicycle with the incredible speed of anxiety, a speed beyond the human body, beyond human endurance.\\tShe arrived before him. Her fear was justified! She could not measure what the anxiety had done to her speed, the acceleration which had broken the equality of rhythm. She arrived as she had feared, at a desolate spot on the road, and the boy had become this invisible image which taunts the dreamer, a mirage that could not be made real. It had become reality eluding the dreamer, the wish unfulfilled.The boy may have arrived later. He may have fallen asleep and not come at all. He may have had a tire puncture. Nothing mattered.

The fullness is like a tidal wave which then carries you, sweeps you into experience and into writing.","Your eyes make me shy.","You had to account for every move, arrival or exit. In the world there was a conspiracy against improvisation. It was only permitted in jazz.","For the first time, in Golconda, she had practiced Larry\'s choice of withdrawing if the people were not of quality. Of preferring solitude to the effort of pretending he was interested in them.","In Peru,\\" said Gonzalo, \\"they cure madness by placing the madman next to a flowing river. The water flows, he throws stones into it, his feelings begin to flow again, and he is cured.","Each one of us possesses in himself a separate and distinct city, a unique city, as we possess different aspects of the same person.","Golconda remained a city where the wind was like velvet, where the sun was made of radium, and the sea as warm as a mother\'s womb.","Perhaps,\\" said the Doctor pensively. \\"It may also be that you Americans are work-cultists, and work is the structure that holds you up, not the joy of pure living.","Will I really be able to accept my mental loneliness?","She is suspicious of words. She lives by her senses, by her intuition. We don\u2019t have a language for the senses. Feelings are images, sensations are like musical sounds. How are you going to tell about them?","I want to make the feminine scar. Helen of Troy was, after all, unfecundable. She was one of the rigid ones, like [Virginia] Woolf and [Rebecca] West.","Hugo has been infinitely tender with me, but while he talks of June I think of our hands locked together. She does not reach the same sexual center of my being that man reaches; she does not touch that. What, then, has she moved in me? I have wanted to possess her as if I were a man, but I have also wanted her to love me with the eyes, the hands, the senses that only women have. It is a soft and subtle penetration.","He was only for the joyous days, the days of courage, when she could share with him all the good things he brought with his passion for novelty and change. But he knew nothing of her; he was no companion to her sadness. He could never imagine anyone else\u2019s mood, only his own. His own were so immense and loud, they filled his world and deafened him to all others. He was not concerned to know whether she could live or breathe within the dark caverns of his whale-like being, within the whale belly of his ego.","My arms were taken away from me, she sang. I was punished for clinging. I clung. I clutched all those I loved; I clutched at the lovely moments of life; my hands closed upon every full hour. My arms were always tight and craving to embrace and hold the light, the wind, the sun, the night, the whole world. I wanted to caress, to heal, to rock, to lull, to surround, to encompass. And I strained and I held so much that they broke; they broke away from me. Everything eluded me then.I was condemned not to hold.","Lillian did not know then that the one who believes he can pay this early debt meets a bottomless well. Because the first denial has set off a fatality of revenge which no amount of giving can placate.","I have never been able to talk as I think, to anyone. With most people you can only talk about ideas, not the channel through these ideas pass, the atmosphere in which they bathe, the subtle essence which escapes as one clothes them. Most of the time, I don\u2019t feel like talking about ideas anyway. I am more interested in sensations.","He observed confusion and chaos, which I call living by one\'s emotions instead of one\'s mind.","My attraction to drugs is based on an immense desire to annihilate awareness.","You have broken down all formal order, grooves, more than anyone I know outside of Dostoevsky\u2019s books.","Introspection does not need to be a still life.

It drinks me slowly, inspires me into space. If I do not close my eyes, it will drink all of me. I seep upward, in long icy threads, too light, and yet inside me there is a fire too, the nerves are twisted, there is no rest from this long tunnel dragging me, or am I pushing myself out of the tunnel, or is the child being pushed out of me, or is the light drinking me. Am I dying? The ice in the veins, the cracking of the bones, this pushing in darkness, with a small shaft of light in the eyes like the edge of the knife, the feeling of a knife cutting the flesh, the flesh somewhere is tearing as if it were burned through by a flame, somewhere my flesh is tearing and the blood is spilling out.

I am so ready to admit what a supremely developed ego would not admit: that June is a terrifying and inspiring character who makes every other woman insipid, that I would live her life except for my compassion and my conscience, that she may destroy Henry the man, but Henry the writer is more enriched by ordeals than by peace.","Anais: \u2018I made a note to ask you why I am obsessed with a few persons only. Why are my devotions so concentrated on a few people? I do not spread out as Henry does.\u2019 Dr. Allendy: \'Yes, exactly, it is a bad sign. You do not really confide in many people, then they do not know you, and then you quickly surmise they do not understand and love you. On the few people you feel connected with, you pour a lavish devotion. This must cease. In love, too, one must relinquish to really love. You cannot admit rivalry. The more broadly and expansively you love, without exclusiveness, the more you reach the mystic whole, the larger sense of love, the less individualistic, the more universal love.","Once a month, the moonstorm. Dust in the eyes and ghosts in the veins. The blood of woman is spilling and all the strength ebbs away.","Awareness hurts. Relationships hurts. Life hurts. But to float, to drift, to live in the dream does not hurt.","She could do nothing. Djuna\u2019s words illuminated her chaos, but changed nothing. What was it Djuna said: that life tended to crystallize into patterns which became traps and webs. That people tended to see each other in their first \u201cstate or \u201cform\u201d and to adopt a rhythm in consequence. That they had greatest difficulty in seeing the transformations of the loved one, in seeing the becoming. If they did finally perceive the new self, they had the greatest difficulty nevertheless in changing the rhythm. The strong one was condemned to perpetual strength, the weak to perpetual weakness. The one who loved you best condemned you to a static role because he had adapted his being to the past self. If you attempted to change, warned Djuna, you would find a subtle, perverse opposition, and perhaps sabotage! Inwardly and outwardly, a pattern was a form which became a prison. And then we had to smash it. Mutation was difficult. Attempts at evasion were frequent, blind evasions, evasions from dead relips, false relationships, false roles, and sometimes from the deeper self too, because of the great obstacle one encountered in affirming it. All our emotional history was that of the spider and the fly, with the added tragedy that the fly here collaborated in the weaving of the web. Crimes were frequent. People in desperation turned about and destroyed each other. No one could detect the cause or catch the criminal. There was no visible victim. It always had the appearance of suicide.\u201d","What does it mean that you have not written me?... Am I a dream to you, am I not real and warm for you? What new loves, new ecstasies, new impulses move you now?","Do you have regrets that we were so overwhelmed? Do you ever wish to live those hours over again and differently, with more confidence.","You sought to preserve your creative instincts and what would nourish them. But neurosis itself does not nourish the artist, you know; he creates in spite of it, out of anything, any material given to him. The torments and hells of [crazy men], are not for you.","Henry, do you really believe I for instance would stop helping you and entrust you to the care of another woman while I had strength left in me to do it myself, while I loved you?","Eu sunt femeia care ofer\u0103 iluzie, care prime\u015fte imagina\u0163ia b\u0103rbatului.O situa\u0163ie pe care t\xe2rfa o invidiaz\u0103...T\xe2rfa domne\u015fte \xeen realitate.","The origin of illness may be in the past, but the virulent crisis must be dynamically tackled. I believe in attacking the core of the illness, through its present symptoms, quickly, directly. The past is a labyrinth. One does not have to step into it and move step by step through every turn and twist. The past reveals itself instantly, in today\u2019s fever or abscess of the soul.","She needed a confessor! Would she find it there, in the world of the artists? All over the world they had their meeting places, their affiliations, their rules of membership, their kingdoms, their chiefs, their secret channels of communication. They established common beliefs in certain painters, certain musicians, certain writers. They were the misplaced persons too, unwanted at home usually, or repudiated by their families. But they established new families, their own religions, their own doctors, their own communities.","It was as if in captivity, her brilliant plumage were losing its brilliance. She felt the metamorphosis. She knew she was moulting.","This openness, which is closed again as soon as we face a partial relationship, the one who understands only one part of us, is the miraculous openess which takes place in whole love.","If you do not breathe through writing, if you do not cry out in writing, or sing in writing, then don\'t write.","There are a great many times we are passive in the face of destiny, forgetting that we really are able to be the captains of our destiny. We are taught a kind of passivity; the culture has taught us that a certain passivity is a feminine quality. So the day that I was told by Otto Rank that I was responsible for the failures, the defeats that had happened to me, and that it was in my power to conquer them, that day was a very exhilarating day. Because if you\u2019re told that you\u2019re responsible that means that you an do something about it. Whereas the people who say society is responsible, or some of the feminist women who say man is responsible, can only complain. You see if you put the blame on another, there is nothing you can do. I preferred to take the blame, because that also means that one can act, and it\u2019s such a relief from passivity, from being the victim.","The more hunger, the greater the desires, like those of men in prison, wild and haunting. So we had here a perfect world in which to grow the flower of eroticism. Of course, if you get too hungry, too continuously, you become a bum, a tramp.","I have decided that if analysis is a hothouse, a hastening of wisdom and growth, nevertheless the life experience must be actually lived out and through, completely, in spite of it; everything that is lived out in the imagination is poison.","No rest for me anywhere. No rest from writing, awareness, insights, memories, fantasies, analogies, free associations. Writing becomes imperative for a surcharged head.","We give to others only peripheral improvisations. The plots, and themes of the music, like the plots and themes of our life, never alchemized into words, existed only in a state of music, stirring or numbing, exalting or despairing, but never named.","There are things one reads that make you aware that you have lived nothing, felt nothing, experienced nothing up to that time. How can i begin to feel - to feel? I want to fall in love in such a way that the mere sight of a man, even a block away from me, will shake and pierce me.","For I am the kind of dangerous dreamer who executes all his reveries, wishes, words, promises, plans. The wildest and the lightest. A wish for me is not a game: it\'s a creation.","Everything with me is either worship and passion or pity and understanding.

All the ships are sinking with fire in their bowels, and there are fires hissing in the cellars of every house.","Patients weep when they discover they are their own victimizers and not the victim of others. They weep when they discover they are responsible for their own suffering.","The dawn! The dawn, I repeated. Henry thought it was the dawn itself which was a new experience. I could not explain what I felt. It was the first time I had not felt the compulsion to escape; it was the first time I had abandoned myself to fraternity, exchange, confessions, without feeling suddenly the need to take flight. All night I had stayed there, without experiencing that abrupt end to fusion, that sudden and painful consciousness of separation, of reaching ultimately and always the need of my own world, the inability to remain outside, estranged, at some moment or other, from everyone. This had not happened, this dawn had come as the first break in the compulsion and tyranny of inadaptation. (The way I once concealed from myself this drama of perpetual divorce was to blame the clock. It was time to go, in place of now I must go, because relationship is so difficult for me, so strained, so laborious, its continuance, its flow.) I never knew what happened. At a party, at a visit, at a play, a film, came a moment of anguish. I cannot sustain the role, the pretense that I am at one with others, synchronized. Where was the exit? Flight. The imperative need of flight. Was it the failure to remove the obstacles, the walls, the barriers, the effort? Dawn had come quietly, and found me sitting at ease with Henry and Fred, and it was the dawn of freedom from a nameless enemy.","The skins matched all the tones of chocolate, coffee and wood. There were many white suits and dresses, and many of those flowered dresses which in the realm of printed dresses stand in the same relation as the old paintings of flowers and fruit done by maiden aunts to a Matisse, or a Braque.","A couple was leaning over the railing, and Lillian could hear the woman say: \\"Even if you don\'t mean it, just for tonight, say you love me.

We are stronger together ... we will have less doubts.\\" This seemed deeply true, yet I wonder if it is good to ally similarities, one agreeing with the other, as twins might, so that this might give an illusion of balance, reassure us about our orientation, or whether we should seek this by contrast with others,","What is the greatest need of human beings?

The man or woman who for the sake of family life, children, takes up work he does not like, disciplines himself, sacrifices some fantasy he had once, to travel or to paint, or even possibly to write, may feel toward the artist and writer a jealousy of his adventurous life. The artist and the writer have generally paid the full price for their independence and for the privilege of doing work they love, or for their artistic rebellions against standardized living or values.","\u0644\u0627 \u0623\u0633\u062a\u0637\u064a\u0639 \u0623\u0646 \u0623\u0643\u0648\u0646 \u0648\u0627\u062b\u0642\u0629 \u0645\u0646 \u0623\u064a \u062d\u062f\u062b \u0623\u0648 \u0623\u064a \u0645\u0643\u0627\u0646 \u060c \u0648\u062d\u062f\u0647\u0627 \u0639\u0632\u0644\u062a\u064a \u0623\u0646\u0627 \u0645\u062a\u0623\u0643\u062f\u0629 \u0645\u0646\u0647\u0627","Men have their periods too, but the blood doesn\u2019t stop flowing automatically.

People stretch on specially inclined chairs and receive the images in utter, infantile passivity.

Will I ever reach joy? It hides behind the turning merry-go-round of the traveling circus. As soon as I approach it, it is no longer joy. Joy is a foam, an illumination. I am poorer and hungrier for the want of it. When I am in the dance, joy is outside in the elusive garden. When I am in the garden, I hear it exploding from the house. When I am traveling, joy settles like an aurora borealis over the land I leave. When I stand on the shore I see it bloom on the flag of a departing ship. What joy? Have I not possessed it? I want the joy of simple colors, street organs, ribbons, flags, not a joy that takes my breath away and throws me into space alone where no one else can breathe with me, not the joy that comes from a lonely drunkenness. There are so many joys, but I have only known the ones that come like a miracle, touching everything with light.","A marine snail gliding through the familiar city.

Because writing, for me, is an expanded world, a limitless world, containing all.","I can see, I can see that it is in this distorted vision of the world\'s proper proportions that lies the secret of our fears. We make the animals bigger with our fears.

She does not judge, she understands.","The only nonhuman existence is what we call our human life. If we live our human life and none other, directly, then we subject ourselves to the most inhuman of all conditions\u010c slavery to family and national taboos, wars, illness, poverty, deatah. Even the phrase \\"earning our living\\" is inhuman. Without religion or art or analysis to transpose the stark horror, we fall into the malady of our age with its great devotion to naturalism. A painting in a house is there to represent a color, a form, a realm we may not have been able to possess. A book opens a realm which our need to earn a living may have made unattainable. Everything that helps us to transpose the unbearable into a myth also helps the creation of distance from our inhuman life, to allow us to mix a little objectivity with the harsh, violent torments of our human bondage.","I love beauty but I find it easier to reject it now because I love other things more than beauty: genius, passion, nature\u2013all of which are often manifested without beauty of form. I love ugliness because it expresses strength.","He had appointed her not only guardian angel, but a member of his ideals.","Life shrinks or expands in proportion to one\u2019s courage.","Now everybody separated that and said: there is either rushing virtuously to live a collective life or else there is this selfish introspection and concern with your own development. But the two are completely interdependent, they are completely interactive; and the more you have this response to life, the more you have a source to respond with, then of course the more enrichment you pass around you. Why we made a dichotomy between those two \u2014 saying that the two wouldn\u2019t enrich each other \u2014 I don\u2019t know. Because whatever the individual does for himself and by himself is something that ultimately flows back again like a river into the collective unconscious. So if we are disappointed today in the external changes it\u2019s because not enough of us have worked at raising a better quality of human being.","Every disconnection is death.","[One way of going about liberation] is the political way, changing the laws and fighting for equalities. There are so many ways of doing it. But the other I stress simply because it is the one I know: the psychological way, which is the removal of obstacles so that you can create your own freedom and you don\u2019t have to ask for it. You don\u2019t have to wait for it to be given to you. And the women I chose as my heroines were women who created their own freedom. They didn\u2019t demand it, they didn\u2019t ask for it. They created it. Something in themselves made them independent women, and this kind of independence I stress. [\u2026] It is very easy to blame society or to blame the man, but it actually makes you feel even more helpless. Because that means that you are waiting for the man to liberate you or for the government to liberate you or for history. And that takes a long time. It takes centuries, and it\u2019s too slow for me.","The need of language at this moment, for woman to write well, to express herself, is almost as important as the actual evolution of her growth. The Diary shows this, that the more I wrote, the clearer my thinking was, that the more I expressed myself, the more I was able then to express to the men or the artists around me what I felt or where I stood. It\u2019s a great involvement with language, and the language in the first Diary is not as developed as it is in the second, or in the third. And it was finally by writing that I taught myself to talk with others. So I can\u2019t stress enough for woman at this moment the need for articulateness, the need to care about language; because again the thing that can create misunderstandings and alienation and estrangement is the inability to speak, the inability to write. We need you to write, we need you to speak, we need this revelation of woman who is not only trying to be revealed to herself but needs to be revealed to others. I owe to writing everything. I owe to it the facts that I can sit here and talk with you. I know you don\u2019t believe that, but I didn\u2019t talk at all. And an aunt came one time and said to my mother: \u2018I\u2019m awfully sorry, but you have a subnormal child.\u2019 When I was thirty I listened always to other people, and I never said a word. I was really mute. So I taught myself to talk, and I owe to writing the fact that we can talk together now. To me there is no question about it, there is no doubt of its meaning to our life.","We write to lure and enchant and console others. We write to serenade our lovers. We write to taste life twice, in the moment, and in retrospection... We write to be able to transcend our life, to reach beyond it... We write to expand our world when we feel strangled, or constricted, or lonely.","Lillian\'s recurrent dream of a ship that could not reach the water, that sailed laboriously, pushed by her with great effort, through city streets, had determined her course toward the sea, as if she would give this ship, once and for all, its proper sea bed.","Night. The stars and the moon impassive, undisturbed, eternal. A little of their impassivity flows into me. They are consoling. They reduce the intensity and acuteness of human sorrow. I feel less strangled, less oppressed. I transfer to the moon and the stars some of the trust in God I once had, and realize that serenity comes from an acceptance of death. Man\u2019s life span is short. There is an end to pain.","I have run away with a part of my treasures, my memories, my obsession, with preserving, portraying, recording. All of us may die, but in these pages we will continue to smile, talk, make love.","Films are like a dose of opium, then as you come out in the street it\u2019s a shock, and you are brutally awakened from your dream. But when you stay, you never wake up. The dream goes on working. I would fall asleep for a while and then see images on the screen, and I could not tell the difference between the film and a dream.","But my faith seems naive, at least today.

And he wanted these flowers for her to wear in her hair. Mathilde did not have them. But as soon as the man left she went to look at herself in the mirror. This was the kind of feeling she wanted to inspire. Could she?","I cross the street and walk into the Printemps. I go to the counter with necklaces and bracelets and earrings, which dazzle me always. I stand like a fascinated savage. Glitter. Amethyst. Turquoise. Shell pink. Irish green. I would like to be naked and cover myself in cold crystal jewelry. Jewelry and perfume.","Henry, there are moments when I am almost frightened at the way you have invaded me.

I consider it a very ugly custom, and if I couldn\'t go out as I wished, I would leave this country [Spain], if only because of that one custom of the inhabitants.","I am made only for passion; it is the temperature of love that I cannot endure. I am afraid, and I think it is death- everything but passion seems like death to me. Only in fever do I feel life.","I came away with pieces of you sticking to me; I am walking about, swimming, in an ocean of blood, your Andalusian blood, distilled and poisonous.","Then I realized the vital necessity of art. Human life, yes, you nurse people, you clean house, you market, but then comes the moment of solace and flight. i sit and write and summon other friends, other forms of life, other experiences, and the voyage and the exploration, the delving into character, the vast expanse of life\'s possibilities and potentialities, contemplation of future travels, of dazzling friendships, all this then makes the chores and the sacrifices beautiful because they are diverted toward some beautiful aim, they become part of the structure of a work of art.","Ana\xefs, I only thought I loved you before; it was nothing like this certainty that\u2019s in me now. Was all this so wonderful only because it was brief and stolen? Were we acting for each other, to each other?","As he sits there, I feel that I can see his mind as I see his body, and it is labyrinthine, fertile, sentient.

And when you are thinking constantly, writing in your head, writing while you undress, wash your teeth, scrub the dishes, etc. you get roiled and everything turns to mud.","Ella bebe y fuma.

Everything is me, because I have rejected all conventions, the opinion of the world, all its laws. I am not obliged, as you and Jeanne are, to play a social role.","My image of others has gone through a thousand transformations, from idealization to total rejection, to re-creation and rescue of a totally new self. As I changed, my perspective changed. The theme of images. How one must struggle against this creation and invention of others, listen to them attentively, let them state their own case, weigh and balance the impressions. Otherwise this invention takes over, or projection. We are like sculptors, constantly carving out of others the image we long for, need, love or desire.

This is what gives sex its surprising textures, its subtle transformations, its aphrodisiac elements. Sex loses all its power and magic when it becomes explicit, mechanical, overdone, when it becomes a mechanistic obsession. It becomes a bore. You are shrinking your world of sensations. You are withering it, starving it, draining its blood. If you nourished your sexual life with all the excitements and adventures which love injects into sensuality, you would be the most potent human being in the world. The source of sexual power is curiosity, passion. You are watching its little flame die of asphyxiation. Sex does not thrive on monotony. Sex must be mixed with tears, laughter, words, promises, scenes, jealousy, envy, all of the spices of fear, foreign travel, new faces, novels, stories, dreams, fantasies, music, dancing, opium, wine.","El dolor es para superarlo, no para revolcarse en \xe9l.","It astonishes me how delicately you can make distinctions between women.

Make literature. Seek new words in the dictionary. Chisel new phrases, pour the tears into a mold, style, form, eloquence. Cut out newspaper clippings carefully. Use cement glue. Have your photograph taken. Tell everyone how much you owe them. Tell Allendy he has cured you. Tell your editor he has discovered a genius, and turn around into your work again, like a scorpion in his fire ring, devouring himself.","Why has she loved ships so deeply, why has she always wanted to sail away from this world? Why has she always dreamed of flight, of departure?","The ground gives way under my feet. It is the ironies which swallow the ground and leave one dizzy and stranded. Irony of loves never properly timed, of tragedies that should not be tragedies, of passions which miss each other as if aimed by blind men, of blind cruelties and even blinder loves, of incongruities and deceptive fulfillments. Every realization is not a culmination but a delusion. The pattern seems to come to an end and it is only another knot. [...] [He] comes when I have gone beyond him; he is given to me when I no longer need him, when I am free of him. In every fulfillment there is a mockery which runs ahead of me like a gust of wind, always ahead.","Why can\'t we know those we love are about to die, so as to give them the words of love they need, the last praise or reassurance? We could not bear to know, but that is not true, for it is in the not knowing that is prepared all the sources of our suffering later.

It has become a cadaver.","The curse has been the multiplication of those who haven\u2019t yet made their individual selection of reading the work before coming to talk to me. They come out of some kind of contagion. And this is where I find the danger of mass thinking or mass media or whatever it is: that people come without having any relation to the thing they come to. I would have liked better meeting those who really wanted to have some kind of dialogue with that particular attitude in life. [\u2026] How do you keep a thing intimate in America where everything is always multiplied by people who have not really approached it sincerely, organically, individually, but just because they heard the name or because they saw you on T.V.

They would not serve for war and they wouldn\u2019t serve for separation between races and they wouldn\u2019t divide us. We wouldn\u2019t have so much hostility as we have in our society, a frightening amount of hostility.

In no period has the role of the parents loomed as immense, because we have recognized the determinism, but at the same time an exaggeration in the size of the Enormous Parent does not need to be permanent and irretrievable. The time has come when, having completed the scientific study of the importance of parents, we now must re-establish our power to revoke their imprint, to reverse our patterns, to kill our fatal downward tendencies. We do not remain smaller in suture than our parents. Nature had intended them to shrink progressively in our eyes to human proportions while we reach for our own maturity. Their fallibilities, their errors, their weaknesses were intended to develop our own capacity for parenthood. We were to discover their human weakness not to overwhelm or humiliate them, but to realize the difficulty of their task and awaken our own human protectiveness toward their failures or a respect for their partial achievement. But to place all responsibilities upon them is wrong too. If they gave us handicaps, they also gave us their courage, their obstinacy, their sacrifices, their moments of strength. We cannot forever await from them the sanction to mature, to impose on them our own truths, to resist or perhaps defeat them in our necessity to gain strength.We cannot always place responsibility outside of ourselves, on parents, nations, the world, society, race, religion. Long ago it was the gods. If we accepted a part of this responsibility we would simultaneously discover our strength. A handicap is not permanent. We are permitted all the fluctuations, metamorphoses which we all so well understand in our scientific studies of psychology.Character has ceased to be a mystery and we can no longer refuse our responsibility with the excuse that this is an unformed, chaotic, eyeless, unpredictable force which drives, tosses, breaks us at will.","Perfidious, infinitely desirable, drawing me to her as towards death.","I had to go out and drink a little because I was going nutty writing this stuff.

Tudo aquilo parecia apto a abandonar a luz do dia comum para explorar os mundos submersos.","Whatever tragic spirit lay behind this polished surface went into her singing, with which she tore people\'s serenity to shreds, spreading anxiety and regrets and nostalgia everywhere.","The enormous difference between the relationships you need, and the one you deeply want. The need is created out of an accumulation of negativities, planted by traumatic experiences: fear, doubts, anxiety, dependence, weakness in certain realms, inadequacy, incompleteness. A certain relationship can remove the fear, calm anxiety, supply a certain completion, replace a loss, fulfill an organic insufficiency, lull an insecurity, supply a substitute love.","Every other illness is understood, shared with other human beings. Not this one. It is mysterious and solitary, it is as ineffectual and unmoving to others as the attempted crying out of a mute person. / Everybody understands hunger, physical pain, illness, poverty, slavery. But no one understands that this moment at which I crossed the street is more annhiliating than a concrete catastrophe. Anxiety is a woman screaming without a voice, out of a nightmare.","the legends of friendship and love between man and man, woman and woman, or man and woman, lies this hideous narcissistic image of the single, all-sufficient self, the primitive generative force which fecundates itself, which in its irrepressible ebullience threw off a planetary system that forms the whole corpus of mythological worship and love. \u201cIn the beginning was the word and the word became flesh.","You can only see in others what your nature allows you to see. The range of your vision depends on the extent of the personal development. The personal, if it is deep enough, becomes universal, mythical, symbolic; I never generalize, intellectualize. I see, I hear, I feel. These are my primitive instruments of discovery.","The idea of deserving love. And then watching love being given to people who did nothing to deserve it.","I was not travelling away from human life, I was seeking my own fulfillment. Searching for heightened moments uninterrupted by life\u2019s daily exigencies.","For the first time I have conquered restlessness, my imagination does not wander to all the far places towards all the far strangers, questing, expecting what? For the first time my body and soul are together, and the sound of a window closing, a door closing, is no more alarming than the wings of an icon closing over a figure praying.","One thing about American liberality, obscenity, etc. Just saw a book of Hemingway\u2019s\u2014short stories\u2014Winner Takes Nothing.

It is a void which has to be spanned by the automobile. It takes an hour to reach a movie, two hours to reach a friend. So the coyotes howl and wail at the awful emptiness of mountains, deserts, hills.","everywhere i miss you.","[Ana\xefs:] Your two letters on cellophane just arrived\u2014of the 7th. Don\u2019t even sign your name now. No mention of my name. Not a word of love. If I hadn\u2019t received your cable I would be stark crazy by now.","eeing Eduardo yesterday crystallized my mental chill. I listen to his explanation of my feelings. It sounds very plausible. I have suddenly turned cold towards Henry because I witnessed his cruelty to Fred. Cruelty has been the great conflict in my life. I witnessed cruelty in my childhood -- Father\'s cruelty towards Mother and his sadistic punishment of my brothers and me -- and the sympathy I felt for my mother reached hysteria when she and my father quarreled, acts which paralyzed me later. I grew up with such an incapacity for cruelty it amounts to a weakness.","Para un escritor, un personaje es un ser con quien no se siente ligado por el sentimiento. Elverdadero amor destruye la \xabliteratura\xbb. Por eso, tambi\xe9n, Henry no puede escribir sobre m\xed, yquiz\xe1 nunca escriba sobre m\xed \u2014por lo menos, hasta que nuestro amor se acabe y, entonces, yo meconvierta en un \xabpersonaje\xbb, es decir, en una personalidad alejada, no fundida con \xe9l.","We do not see things as they are, we see them as we are","We love shadows of our hidden selves in others.","But I am not free. I am incapable of destruction.","She cannot be considered as a whole. She is composed of fragments. Only passion gives her a moment of wholeness.","I don\u2019t like superior attitudes based on well-poised intellect. I hate well-poised intellects.","She is so busy just BEING, talking, walking, making love, drinking, that she can achieve nothing else.","He is a genius and yet he is too explicit. June slips between his fingers. You cannot possess without loving.","When I once said I would rather be married to an artist than be one, I was really being a coward. I was really dropping out. I was saying that I would help the artist but I was not going to try to be one. There was nothing wonderful or sacrificial about that. The muse is a very suspect character, because I simply was refusing to take the responsibility of being an artist myself. So I had decided I would be the helper, the assistant; it was really much easier. So when women complain about being forced into that role, I have my doubts. Because I played that role too. After a while I realized Miller wasn\u2019t going to write the book I wanted to write, and that Durrell wasn\u2019t going to write the book I wanted to write. It was up to me.","Ich liebe dein Schweigen, es ist wie meines. Du bist das einzige Wesen, in dessen Gegenwart ich mich wegen meines eigenen Schweigens nicht beunruhigt f\xfchle. Du besitzt ein ungest\xfcmes Schweigen, man f\xfchlt, dass es von Inhalten erf\xfcllt ist. Es ist seltsam lebendiges Schweigen, wie der ge\xf6ffnete Deckel eines Brunnens, aus dem man das geheimnisvolle Murmeln der Erde vernehmen kann.","Analysis is like a shock treatment, it throws you back into childhood in order to recapture the reparable elements, to reconstruct the personality. To reconstruct the personality it is necessary to find the original wound. You have to revaluate the past so it will not remain an incubus or succubus.For example, I look at others with my own eyes, my own values, I evaluate them by my own standards, but when it comes to looking at myself, I look at myself through my father\'s eyes. I judge myself by his standards, and in his eyes I was not beautiful, I had flaws.","(It doesn\u2019t matter what you said that night. I want you from me to have the experience of being loved.) [Ana\xefs]","Seine Augen waren blau vor Sehnsucht und wurden vor Schmerz und Auflehnung wieder schwarz. Er war ein Gewirr verschlungener Nerven, die ohne einen Kern der Ruhe nach allen Seiten vibrierten.","Henry called my house a laboratory of the soul. Enter this laboratory of the soul where every feeling will be X-rayed by Dr. Allendy to expose the blocks, the twists, the deformations, the scars which interfere with the flow of life. Enter this laboratory of the soul where incidents are refracted into a diary, dissected to prove that everyone of us carries a deforming mirror where he sees himself too small or too large, too fat or too thin, even Henry who believes himself so free, blithe, and unscarred. Enter here where one discovers that destiny can be directed, that one does not need to remain in bondage to the first wax imprint made on childhood sensibilities. One need not be branded by the first pattern. Once the deforming mirror is smashed, there is a possibility of wholeness; there is a possibility of joy.","We ought to be much more fearful of what we don\u2019t know. We should really be fearful of an unconscious that inhabits us, that guides us, that influences our life and of which we don\u2019t know the face and don\u2019t know the message. Actually I have much less fear since I confronted fears. What\u2019s frightening to me is people whose unconscious leads them, destroys them, and yet they will never stop and look at it. That\u2019s the minotaur in the labyrinth, which many people never come face to face with. There was a very remarkable percussion composer, Edgar Varese, who always mocked psychology, mocked psychoanalysis, mocked psychiatry. He was satirical about it, wouldn\u2019t have any of it. And yet his whole life pattern was self-destructive. He was an innovator and a tremendous musician. But he blocked himself. His biography is out now, and you can see the pattern. You can see this demon that was driving him, the origin of it. He seemed to be a very fearless, strong, tremendous tempered man with great force; he even looked like a Corsican bandit. But he had no power over the forces that were pushing him. That is what frightens me.","Women always think that when they have my shoes, my dress , my hairdresser, my make-up, it will all work the same way. They do not conceive of the witchcraft that is needed. They do not know that I am not beautiful but that I only appear to be at certain moments.","She fell in love with an extinct volcano.","Perhaps there is nothing at all, perhaps the mystery is that there is no mystery at all. Perhaps she is empty, and there is no June at all. \u201cBut, Henry, how can an empty woman have such a vivid presence, how can an empty woman cause insomnia, awaken so many curiosities? How could an empty woman cause other women to take flight, as you tell me, abdicating immediately before her?\u201d","When Henry telephones, I feel his voice in my veins. I want him to talk into me. I want him to talk into me. I eat Henry, I breathe Henry, Henry is in the sun. My cape is his arm around my waist.","When Henry telephones, I feel his voice in my veins. I want him to talk into me. I eat Henry, I breathe Henry, Henry is the sun. My cape is his arm around my waist.","I thought of you again while reading The Brothers Karamazov (The Sensualists). Everything I read now has a different meaning, a terrible meaning; the way I read Dostoevsky anyway is not reading, it is actual passionate experience, as when I read you.","La fatalit\xe9 se d\xe9place: plus l\u2019homme prend conscience de lui-m\xeame, plus il l\xe0 d\xe9couvre int\xe9rieure.","Ja sam jedino sposobna zbrajati \u017eivot, dok tako prepun ne postane nepodno\u0161ljiv, odve\u0107 sna\u017ean, i raspr\u0161ujem se u krizama histerije, u milijune komadi\u0107a, zbog prevelike koli\u010dine \u017eivota...

(I spell \u201cgod with a small \u201cg\u201d because I do not believe in him, but I love to swear by him, which shows what a Christian fear of sacrilege I have.)\u201d","La amo por lo que se ha atrevido a ser, por su dureza, su crueldad, su ego\xedsmo, su perversidad, su demon\xedaca fuerza destructora.

I need two lives. I am two beings. When I return to Hugo in the evening, to the peace and warmth of the house, I return with a deep contentment, as if this were the only condition for me. I bring home to Hugo a whole woman, freed of all \u2018possessed\u2019 fevers, cured of the poison of restlessness and curiosity which used to threaten our marriage, cured through action. Our love lives, because I live. I sustain and feed it. I am loyal to it, in my own way, which cannot be his way. If he ever reads these lines, he must believe me.

I wanted to say: you can only have blood-consciousness with whores, there is too much mind between us, too much literature, too much illusion\u2014but then you denied there had been only mind.\xa0.\xa0.\xa0.\u201d","Les Fronti\xe8res Humaines[by Ribemont-Dessaigne] came and I looked at the jacket and I do not read it. It looks too good. I am saving it for a rainy day, a day of despair, when one wants to eat his fellow man. I love the looks of it. I believe in it before reading a page.","But I see New York written all over it. Ennui. Futility. Dreary nights. Sad jokes. Creamy voices. Crooning melodies.","I saw a mouth that was at once intelligent, animal, and soft .\xa0.\xa0. strange mixture\u2014a human man, sensitively aware of everything\u2014I love awareness\u2014a man, I told you, whom life made drunk.","We write to taste life twice, in the moment and in retrospection. We write, like Proust, to render all of it eternal, and to persuade ourselves that it is eternal. We write to be able to transcend our life, to reach beyond it. We write to teach ourselves to speak with others, to record the journey into the labyrinth.","Everything with me is either worship and passion or pity and understanding. I hate rarely, though when I hate, I hate murderously","Enter this laboratory of the soul where incidents are refracted into a diary, dissected to prove that every one of us carries a deforming mirror where he sees himself too small or too large, too fat or too thin\u2026 Once the deforming mirror is smashed, there is a possibility of wholeness; there is a possibility of joy. \u2014Diary 1, pg. 105","I\u2019m not going to let the book go for a song\u2014and I\u2019m not going to let Kahane get the idea that he\u2019s doing me a favor by publishing it.","El impulso de crecer y de vivir intensamente es tan imperioso en m\xed que me es imposible resistirme a \xe9l","Es cierto, como dice Hugo, que yo llevo mis pensamientos y especulaciones al diario y que \xe9l s\xf3lo es consciente del dolor que puedo causarle cuando ocurre alg\xfan incidente. Sin embargo, yo soy su diario. S\xf3lo es capaz de pensar en voz alta conmigo o a trav\xe9s m\xedo.","when one is doing a work of imagination, one becomes completely absorbed in it, and that it becomes difficult to come out into the world and participate in it,","\xc9 monstruoso dizer-se que o artista n\xe3o serve a humanidade. Ele foi os olhos, os ouvidos, a voz da humanidade. Sempre foi o transcendentalista que passava a raios X os nossos verdadeiros estados de alma.","So I\u2019m sad. I throw my vanity aside. I\u2019m questioning myself. If the day on which you happen to read this letter proves to be one in which you\u2019re depressed, I know I\u2019ll get one kind of answer. Another day another.","Life\u2019s problems were too limited, that it was a pity, that the function of the artist was to increase these problems, to cause upheavals in the brain, to make people wild and free so that there would be more drama to their lives.","I don\u2019t rave against politics. I ignore it.","Strange that when we finally fly, the separation from the past seems easier to achieve. Height and distance from the earth seem to stabilize the spirit, to liberate it from its sorrow. We enter the consciousness of the cosmos.","I hope you never marry a man you don\u2019t love sexually. That is what I have done. I love everything about him, the way he behaves, his face, his body, the way he works, treats me, his thoughts, his way of smiling, talking, everything except the sexual man in him. I thought I did, before we married.","Oh, God, today I pray [to] you on my knees for Dostoevsky\u2019s obscurity, blindness, the most sacred and precious of all things.","Most diverse clientele\u2014chiefly negroid: trap drummers, dancers, ham actors, pimps, whores, gamblers, fairies. Like Harlem almost. The conversations are rich. Unimaginable! I find all this so much more appetizing than ch\xe1teaus and churches. Human beings! Not relics.","Don\u2019t wait for it, I said. \u201cCreate a world, your world. Alone. Stand alone. Create. And then the love will come to you, then it comes to you. It was only when I wrote my first book that the world I wanted to live in opened to me.\u201d \u201cI feel doomed to\u201d","She laughed when he trailed his phrases like southern vines, or practiced sudden exaggerated severities as children do when they play charades of the father\'s absurd arrogances, of the mother\'s hot-house exudations of charm.","I find that I do not know what to believe, that I have not decided yet whether analysis simplifies and undramatizes our existence, or whether it is the most subtle, the most insidious, the most magnificent way of making dramas more terrible, more maddening.","Great idea on the arrangement of my work. It will make a difference to me to disentangle certain passages, bring certain phrases in relief, help me to find my own bearings. The literalness is not to be attributed to the high and noble reasons I gave you (all that stuff on Rimbaud, metaphysical-artistic imperatives), just sheer laziness, between you and me.","El placer anormal anula el gusto por el normal.","Lost her taste in life and blindly expects me to give it back to her. We talk as people do in books. Strange, brittle, arrowed. Tall, tall windows covered with lace. Pillows under our feet. And life tasteless. And so eager, so eager that I should accomplish a miracle. People always expect miracles.","You must not get trapped in humanity and its struggles. You must keep alive your contact with all things, your relationships to all kinds of people. When you are too much invaded by others\u2019 discords, when you are driven by scruples or guilt to retrogress in order to help others live, and when they try to crystallize you in one role, you lose your ability to maintain and sustain the flow, you arrest the turning of the bigger wheels, you get caught in the spokes.","I smoke, get up, move about. I cannot bear my own company. I have not learned yet to replace introspection by thinking. I could meditate on Spengler, for instance, but in ten minutes I am again devouring myself.","In the evening we are taken to see Rain. I discover Joan Crawford. I think you told me you loved her. So do I. Her face haunts me. The dream-like exaggeration of features, the big mouth, the mouth. The story is ridiculous. The French are jeering. Absolutely jeering and there is almost a scene. The Americans are weeping. Joan Crawford as slut and as angel .\xa0.\xa0. magnificent.","But if every day we become aware of greater and deeper tangles, greater and deeper and more diabolical difficulties, why I can only see the birth of greater and deeper books, that\u2019s all. [.\xa0.\xa0.]","Henry, I\u2019m afraid of the adulation I\u2019m getting. Be severe with me. Don\u2019t let me get spoiled. I knew I should live alone as I did before. It is good for one.","Send for the doctor! I need a medicine man who will solder my body and soul together, which splits at every separation. The doctor says it is the flu. He cannot see the body is empty, the fire is gone, I am king without kingdom, and artist without a home, a stranger to luxury, to power, to bigness, to comfort. I lost a world, a small human world of love and friendship. I am not adventurer, I miss my home, familiar streets, those I love and know well.","A writer could completely baffle a psychologist. A writer and a woman, a woman with imagination, too, and a psychologist half blinded. Oh yea?\u201d","To say that the artist is not serving humanity is monstrous. He has been the eyes, the ears, the voice of humanity. He was always the transcendentalist who x-rayed our true states of being. His role in European culture is clear enough. Here he is given an inferior status, because he is not obviously and directly useful. His usefulness cannot be measured. The artist cannot serve directly.","Nunca hemos sido tan felices ni tan desgraciados. Nuestras peleas son ominosas, tremendas, violentas. Nuestra furia roza el borde de la locura; deseamos la muerte. Tengo el rostro arrasado de l\xe1grimas, las venas de la sien se me hinchan. A Hugo le temblequea la boca. Un sollozo m\xedo lo arroja de repente a mis brazos, entre lloros. Luego me desea f\xedsicamente. Lloramos y nos besamos y alcanzamos el orgasmo en el mismo momento. Y un instante despu\xe9s, analizamos y hablamos racionalmente.","One goes to the magician, as one goes to the analyst, or any quack\u2014to reaffirm one\u2019s own secret volitions. Not to be cured, not to be warned, not to be saved, but to become what one wants to be.","We carefully observe and watch the happenings of the entire world without realizing they are projections of our inner selves.","[Henry:] Strange feeling it gave me, to read [Georges Duhamel\u2019s]Salavin when you were gone\u2014Salavin who resembles you when \u201cil contemplait le pauvre sire avec une int\xe9r\xeat poignant, et, dans son coeur, grandissait un indicible d\xe9sir d\u2019\xeatre aussi cet homme si seul et si bas qu\u2019il ne redoute plus ni l\u2019abandon ni la chute. Who resembles you when you are joyless and springless. You have his moods.\u201d","I take on the dullness of the landscape, the torpid heat of the day, the barren vista of rocks, the anonymous stream of humanity that sluices back and forth through city after city endlessly and ceaselessly. I am protean, to the point of disease.","But listen, I must finish Lawrence, Joyce & Proust. It\u2019s driving me nuts. I feel like a slacker. I\u2019ll spit them out alive, if necessary. I\u2019m screwed up to a frenzy. Vino, vino .\xa0.\xa0. I wish I had the taste for it. Vino isn\u2019t strong enough. It\u2019s blood I want. Henry","We give to our friends only a small part of ourselves. In the climate of love another being emerges.","I never want to try and be a thinker again. I\u2019m not a thinker. I\u2019d really like to read what somebody else wrote about Lawrence, and, by God, hereafter I will.","But in life, we cannot always obtain from the lover a full image or revelation of what he sees in his loved one. It remains hidden from our eyes. Because love not only can detect a potential, aun unborn personality, a buried one, a disguised one, but also bring it into reality.","Entre pelea y pelea somos intensamente felices. Infierno y para\xedso a un tiempo. Somos a la vez libres y esclavos. En ocasiones parec\xeda que supi\xe9semos que la \xfanica atadura que puede unirnos es el frenes\xed, id\xe9ntica intensidad que entre amantes y queridas.","Sabina placed The Firebird on the phonograph. The delicate footsteps of the Firebird were heard at first through infinite distance, each step rousing the phosphorescent sparks from the earth, each note a golden bugle to marshal delight. A jungle of dragon tails thrashing in erotic derisions, a brazier of flesh-smoking prayers, the multiple debris of the stained glass fountains of desire.","Le n\xe9vros\xe9 a tendance \xe0 r\xe9p\xe9ter ind\xe9finiment un comportment vicieux, anormal, \xe0 susciter ind\xe9finiment des situations critiques analogues dont il est chaque fois victime.\xa0.\xa0.\xa0.

It\u2019s no crime.","Hay dos modos de llegar a m\xed, mediante los besos o la imaginaci\xf3n. Pero existe una jerarqu\xeda; los besos por s\xed solos no bastan.","You ought to write my books. How can anybody do anything in three weeks? To do that one must be a god. God took a week to create the world. I take my hat off to him too. It\u2019s stupendous. Unbelievable. Let it stay that way.","Every room is painted a different color. As if there were one room for every separate mood: lacquer red for vehemence, pale turquoise for reveries, peach color for gentleness, green for repose, grey for work at the typewriter.","What is necessary to life, to livingness, is to move on, in other words to move from one kind of problem to another. Jung has mentioned this. The neurotic is obsessed with one kind of problem. He cannot move on.","I\'m restless. Things are calling me away. My hair is being pulled by the stars again","What I detest about these books of maxims is that they are so platitudinously true. A la Moli\xe8re, Aesop, La Rochefoucauld\u2014Shakespeare. They apply to all women, and that must include you too. But somehow it doesn\u2019t ring true to me. But it\u2019s disquieting.","- Are you sad? Do you want me to leave?- I\u2019m not sad, but I\u2019m blocked. My whole past seems to stop me. I can\u2019t let go. I feel as if I can inhale but not exhale. I\u2019m just constrained, unnatural.","Comienzo a ver las cosas con mayor claridad. Ahora s\xe9 por qu\xe9 el primer d\xeda no me fiaba de \xe9l. Sus acciones se hallan desprovistas de sentimiento y de imaginaci\xf3n. Motivadas por meros h\xe1bitos de vida, de aprehensi\xf3n y de an\xe1lisis. Es un saltamontes. Ahora ha saltado a mi vida. Mi sensaci\xf3n de repugnancia se intensifica.","What you said the other day about the futility of running away was very profound; and very courageous. Listen, Henry, I believe you should talk with Jung. I","Jesus, don\u2019t think this is cold. I\u2019m just simply functioning as mind. The whole thing is going to collapse soon\u2014the mind, I mean.","In the last ten days they sold only 9 books, 6 of which were mine. It is trickling along, Eve Adams* still selling a few now and then. Much r\xe9clame in Montparnasse. Have to keep away from [Caf\xe9] D\xf4me and other places because I am constantly being introduced to jackasses who read the book and whom I don\u2019t care to know. [.\xa0.\xa0.]","Mighty dissonances, in the superhuman effort to dissolve the plexus of the medium.","I wonder if the life I am leading is a dream or a reality. I feel far away from everything and everybody.","You don\u2019t know what you are writing. You\u2019re like a painter who has gone blind to his work. Go out. Get on your bicycle. You need movement, rest.","There was in me confusion between love and devotion. I thought all my acts were acts of love, yielding up of the self, the personal. But I did feel hurt that they were all willing to immolate me, and felt unloved according to my own definition of love: sacrifice.","(I am waiting for news from Ezra Pound and from Kay Boyle, to whom I sent carbons. They may make valuable suggestions.)","Too much mind, though, Henry! I do not like Goethe\u2019s complete transference into ideas. I do not like his second metamorphosis. That is not for you. You must, like me, turn it on and off.","You need to take language lessons from me, regularly and obediently, until I pronounce you cured.","Every other illness is understood, shared with other human beings. Not this one. It is mysterious and solitary, it is as ineffectual and unmoving to others as the attempted crying out of a mute person. Everybody understands hunger, physical pain, illness, poverty, slavery. But no one understands that this moment at which I crossed the street is more annhiliating than a concrete catastrophe. Anxiety is a woman screaming without a voice, out of a nightmare.","(Had a cordial note from Dos Passos, in Key West, Fla., saying he would be delighted to receive a copy\u2014but I\u2019m not sending him one, for the reason given.)","This is not language, this is the world being turned inside out, not mathematically in super-dimensional planes, not artistically in violaceous daring, but biologically, atomically, so that not even the creator can any more recognize his world.","You might as well expect of Brancusi that he give us his masterpieces in fried bread crumbs or apple sauce. Can\u2019t be done.","I retract what I said about [Louis-Ferdinand C\xe9line\u2019s] Voyage au Bout de la Nuit. You will have to read it in June. There are affinities there with your earlier work. It\u2019s another form of absolute, and therefore valuable.","I find these nobodies so much more interesting than the celebrated people. Why is that?","The dream then, instead of being something apart from reality, a private world of fantasy or imagination, is actually an essential part of our reality which can be shared and communicated by means of imagery.","Every line is pregnant with meaning and however much the meaning is ransacked, the riddle will remain because only you can explain it, and this riddle is your last triumph\u2014you will never reveal it.","If you look at language merely as craft you are committing l\xe8se-majest\xe9 towards your own sacred tools. You\u2019ve got to have the proper respect\u2014you\u2019ve got to feel awed in its presence (see, I say \u201cawed, not \u201csacred\u201d).\u201d","That means for death, for the final catastrophe in which everything will be buried, because in the dissolution of death a flame is born whose secret is imparted only to those who are then and forever escaping the mould. The secret is incommunicable; it is that last knowledge to which we are driven by our most vital forces, the mystery which makes death not only supportable but desired. Etc. etc.","The Spaniard does not give his mind and soul to the woman! The Spaniard is the man who associates with man only in the building of a world.","I love the sharing. I feel with extraordinary vividness your presence, as if you were reading with me. I actually experience again the sensation of my leaning over your shoulder and kissing your hair and neck while you are reading or writing.","Quiero ser la luz dentrodel globo y la dinamita que explota sobre la m\xe1quina del impresor justo antes de poner el preciosobre la p\xe1gina. Cuando la Tierra gira, mis piernas se, abren a la lava emergente y mi cerebro secongela en el \xc1rtico \u2014o viceversa\u2014, pero debo girar, y mis piernas siempre se abrir\xe1n, incluso enla regi\xf3n del sol de medianoche, porque no espero a la noche \u2014no puedo esperar a la noche\u2014, noquiero perder ni un solo ritmo de su curso, ni un solo laudo de su ritmo.","I can write above the melee, as it were, but I don\u2019t like the forced effort. It doesn\u2019t ring the way I want it to. I get off-key.","You are much much greater on women. C\xe9line is arid.","He says: \u201cYou seem to have finished just suffering life and are beginning to dominate it. Just suffering life is not enough. I know.\u201d","I don\u2019t like veering around from one thing to another\u2014one day the analyst, the next day the dancer, the next day the movies, and so on. I know it\u2019s sheer desperation that provokes this. And I know it\u2019s because I am ineffective that causes it. So it\u2019s no reproach. I\u2019m responsible. But what to do? What, what, what? It drives me nuts.","[Ana\xefs:] [.\xa0.\xa0.] Last night I finished reading [Dorothy Brett\u2019s]Brett and Lawrence in a caf\xe9 and the tears were running down my cheeks as I finished. Believe me, Lawrence was much finer, greater than I ever thought. I have seen so much of myself in him, and his battles with Frieda so keenly resemble my battles, and over similar issues, that it gets me. And then his traits of character, many of them are my own\u2014the defects chiefly. The conclusion is that he created a great body of work\u2014and that answers all claims against him.","Miller is a far more distinguished mind than C\xe9line.","There is a curious contradiction between those who complain that we have too many novels obsessed with the incapacity to achieve relationships and those who constantly upbraid the writers who deal exclusively with personal relationship. Men write about alienation and women about relationships. Feminine writing is often attacked as small, subjective, personal. The impotence to relate to another is the impotence to love others, and from this impotence to crime is a natural step.","I believe one writes because one has to create a world in which one can live. I could not live in any of the worlds offered to me. The world of my parents, the world of war, the world of politics. I had to create a world of my own, like a climate, a country, an atmosphere in which I could breathe, reign & re-create myself\u2026","Pobrecita June, \xa1es tan vulnerable!

Sincere enough, frank, honest, but not so raw. Almost seems justifiable. Mine seems flagrant and wanton.\u201d","Ordinary life does not interest me. I seek only the high moments. I am in accord with the surrealists, searching for the marvelous. I want to be a writer who reminds others that these moments exist; I want to prove that there is infinite space, infinite meaning, infinite dimension.","At night too, she puzzled at the mystery of her desperate need for kindness. As other girls prayed for handsomeness in a lover, or for wealth, or for power, or for poetry, she had prayed fervently: let him be kind.","No one but a woman in love ever seesthe maximum of men\u2019s greatness.","I have holes in my shoes. I do not pay my bills. I try to finish House of Incest.","The unconscious cannot express itself directly because it is a composite of past, present, future, a timeless alchemy of many dimensions. A direct statement, as for an act, would deprive it of its effectiveness. It is an image which bypasses the censor of the mind, affects our emotions and our senses. An act has to be interpreted on two levels\u2014one as action, the other as meaning.","I have a natural flow in the diary: what I produce outside is a distillation, the myth, the poem. The elaboration is here. It is the gem made out of this natural outpouring. Shouldn\u2019t people prefer the gems?","Often he quarreled, warred, drank, with a company of ordinary friends, spent evenings with ignorant people. She could not do this. She liked the exceptional, the extraordinary.","What did I want? I wanted a life with you! And I get instead Radio City, the lights going up, \u201choney I love you, dancing all night, crap shooting, cellophane magic, chrome and black marble.\u201d","There is no doubt that the act of creation is very similar to the act of dreaming. The difference is that it includes an activity which has been difficult to analyze. It is not only the power to summon an image, but the power to compose with this image. The second faculty, the faculty of active creation, is what is missing from the use of drugs. Drugs induce passivity. Passivity, like the passivity of India induced by religion, is destructive both to human life and to art.","But that is poetry, I protest. Poetry is an abstraction.","The precondition, then, of the creative personality is not only acceptance, but its actual glorification of itself.","She would have liked to be like him, near to everyone, anyone, but she could not. It saddened her.","Explanations are for husbands, for people you don\u2019t care about any more.","Cannot or will not accept himself. How can I accept a limited definable self when I feel, in me, all possibilities?","What interests me is not the core but the potentialities of this core to multiply and expand infinitely. The diffusion of the core, its suppleness and elasticity, rebound, ramifications. Spanning, encompassing, space-devouring, star-trodden journeys, everything around and between the core.","With the use of drugs people became passive, uncreative tourists in the world of images.","Lawrence may have been childish etc. etc., but like Dostoevsky he at least went to the bottom of feelings, what no Frenchman will disturb himself to do.","Everybody who keeps cool is superior. But who likes the man who keeps cool? Not I. If you go on like this I will fight!","It is after all only the intensity of feeling which makes Lady Chatterley superior to any French book on the same subject (even Lucienne by Jules Romain) and to this statement I will stick until I die.","The day we cease to take nourishment from the underground rivers of the psyche, we feel life is empty. We only become aware of alienation when neurosis sets in as the symptom of its existence.","Not one but many Djunas descended the staircase of the barge, one layer formed by the parents, the childhood, another molded by her profession and her friends, still another born of history geology, climate, race, economics, and all the backgrounds and backdrops, the sky and nature of the earth, the pure sources of birth, the influence of a tree, a word dropped carelessly, an image seen, and all the corrupted sources: books, art, dogmas, tainted friendships, and all the places where a human being is wounded... People add up their physical mishaps, the stubbed toes, the cut finger, the burn scar, the fever, the cancer, the microbe, the infection, the wounds and broken bones. They never add up the accumulated bruises and scars of the inner lining, forming a complete universe of reactions, a reflected world through which no event could take place without being subjected to a personal private interpretation, through this kaleidoscope of memory, through the peculiar formation of the psyche\'s sensitive photographic plates, to this assemblage of emotional chemicals through which every word, every event, every experience is filtered, digested, deformed, before it is projected again upon people and relationships.","Spengler tells how the Greeks never knew introspection [.\xa0.\xa0.]. He designates this as a Faustian malady. He is too fond of the Faustian soul, Spengler, did you notice? But how magnificently he writes about de Vinci, the painter I love best.","It is too bad we could not have gone to Spain. There I am sure it would have been grand\u2014even Barcelona. But these imitation Parises are frightful. Morbid. It makes one realize that 9/10 of humanity is moronic\u2014just beast and plant. If the earth is theirs, then let them have it.","We do not see the world as it is. We see the world as we are.","Oh, Henry, I can\u2019t bear to be writing you\u2014I want you desperately, I want to open my legs so wide, I\u2019m melting and palpitating. I want to do things so wild with you that I don\u2019t know how to say them. Hugo is calling. I\u2019ll answer the rest of the letter tonight.","For the writer the conscious mind may be the great inhibitor, the great censor. This conscious mind is created by social mores, education, environment, family pressures, and conventions. For creativity it is necessary to work with the unconscious which accumulates pure experience, reactions, impressions, intuitions, images, memories\u2014an unconscious freed from the negative effect of societal evaluations. The conscious mind can only act later as critic, selector, discarder.","On what wings does she take flight from Henry? As if the sensual act had been but a mouth applied to an opium pipe.","Frailty. Sweet, treacherous acquiescence. Bird docility. You became a woman with me. I was almost terrified by it. You are not just thirty years old\u2014you are a thousand years old.","I could not live in any of the worlds offered to me \u2014 the world of my parents, the world of war, the world of politics. I had to create a world of my own, like a climate, a country, an atmosphere in which I could breathe, reign, and recreate myself when destroyed by living. That, I believe, is the reason for every work of art.","I read the paper about suicides and murders and I understand it all thoroughly. I feel murderous, suicidal.

Estaria ela aprendendo a caminhar de modo m\xe1gico sobre carv\xf5es em brasa?","(Elena) Algo criara dentro dela um estado de perp\xe9tua defesa contra as possibilidades de experi\xeancia, um impulso de fugir que a retirava das cenas de prazer onde poderia se expandir.

Very few people are gifted for it. I had the vocation. It showed very early in my capacity for deluding myself... What I corrupted was what is called the truth in favour of a marvellous world. I could always improve on the facts... The smoke issuing from Aladdin\'s lamp was my first smokescreen, and the lies learned from fairytales were my first perjuries. Let us say I had perverted tendencies: I believed everything I read. I never found a way to get what I wanted except by robbery.","The relief of opening one\'s hand and letting go was immense.

It\u2019s a desperate moment, but beyond the temporary paralysis, I feel already the joy of a good bold cutting out of the mediocre.","We do not see things as they are, we see them as we are.","I feel that if I sit down now I will do some bad thinking about Lawrence. Remember Gide on Dostoevsky\u2014\u201cWhen he began to explain himself he showed himself a bad thinker.","I think sometimes that perhaps I have been unfair to put my writing above everything else. I am a man and I want my woman.
