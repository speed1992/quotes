That is why there are unforgettable moments and unique people!","Life is what we make of it. Travel is the traveler. What we see isn\'t what we see but what we are.","The feelings that hurt most, the emotions that sting most, are those that are absurd - The longing for impossible things, precisely because they are impossible; nostalgia for what never was; the desire for what could have been; regret over not being someone else; dissatisfaction with the world\u2019s existence. All these half-tones of the soul\u2019s consciousness create in us a painful landscape, an eternal sunset of what we are.","Solitude desolates me; company oppresses me.","Stones in the road? I save every single one, and one day I\'ll build a castle.","I wasn\u2019t meant for reality, but life came and found me.","There is a time when it is necessary to abandon the used clothes, which already have the shape of our body and to forget our paths, which takes us always to the same places. This is the time to cross the river: and if we don\'t dare to do it, we will have stayed, forever beneath ourselves","The world belongs to who doesn\'t feel. The primary condition to be a practical man is the absence of sensitivity.","If you cannot live alone, you were born a slave.","I am nothing. I\'ll never be anything. I couldn\'t want to be something. Apart from that, I have in me all the dreams in the world.","Every man who deserves to be famous knows it is not worth the trouble.","There are no norms. All people are exceptions to a rule that doesn\u2019t exist.","Why is art beautiful? Because it\'s useless. Why is life ugly? Because it\'s all ends and purposes and intentions.","In order to understand, I destroyed myself.","If we knew the truth, we\'d see it; all else is system and outskirts.","Everything is worthwhile if the soul is not small.","Art consists in making others feel what we feel.","We never love anyone. What we love is the idea we have of someone. It\'s our own concept\u2014our own selves\u2014that we love.","My soul is a hidden orchestra; I know not what instruments, what fiddlestrings and harps, drums and tamboura I sound and clash inside myself. All I hear is the symphony.","I always live in the present. The future I can\'t know. The past I no longer have.","To be great, be whole; Exclude nothing. Be whole in everything.","For who expects nothing, all that comes is grateful","Literature exists because the world isn\'t enough.","Literature is the most agreeable way of ignoring life.","Have you ever considered, beloved other, how invisible we are to each other? We look at each other without seeing. We listen to each other and hear only a voice inside out self. The words of others are mistakes of our hearing, shipwrecks of our understanding. How confidently we believe OUR meanings of other people\'s words.","I\u2019m beginning to know myself. I don\u2019t exist. I\u2019m the space between what I\u2019d like to be and what others made of me. Just let me be at ease and all by myself in my room.","Ah, who will save me from existing? It\'s neither death nor life that I want.","No intelligent idea can gain general acceptance unless some stupidity is mixed in with it.","It\'s been a long time since I\'ve been me.","Life is good, but Wine is better.","There\'s no regret more painful than the regret of things that never were.","Sometimes, when I wake up at night, I feel invisible hands weaving my destiny.","To know how to think with emotions and to feel with intellect.","There are ships sailing to many ports, but not a single one goes where life is not painful.","My past is everything I failed to be.","I\'d woken up early, and I took a long time getting ready to exist.","Man shouldn\u2019t be able to see his own face \u2013 there\u2019s nothing more sinister. Nature gave him the gift of not being able to see it, and of not being able to stare into his own eyes. Only in the water of rivers and ponds could he look at his face. And the very posture he had to assume was symbolic. He had to bend over, stoop down, to commit the ignominy of beholding himself. The inventor of the mirror poisoned the human heart.","As we wash our body so we should wash destiny, change life as we change clothes.","I bear the wounds of all the battles I avoided.","Wise is he who enjoys the show offered by the world.","Life is full of paradoxes, as roses are of thorns.","I feel as if I\'m always on the verge of waking up.","Everything interests me, but nothing holds me.","I\'ve always rejected being understood. To be understood is to prostitute oneself. I prefer to be taken seriously for what I\'m not, remaining humanly unknown, with naturalness and all due respect","I suffer from life and from other people. I can\u2019t look at reality face to face. Even the sun discourages and depresses me. Only at night and all alone, withdrawn, forgotten and lost, with no connection to anything real or useful \u2014 only then do I find myself and feel comforted.","Every day things happen in the world that cannot be explained by any law of things we know. Every day they\'re mentioned and forgotten, and the same mystery that brought them takes them away, transforming their secret into oblivion. Such is the law by which things that can\'t be explained must be forgotten. The visible world goes on as usual in the broad daylight. Otherness watches us from the shadows.","I\u2019ve dreamed a lot. I\u2019m tired now from dreaming but not tired of dreaming. No one tires of dreaming, because to dream is to forget, and forgetting does not weigh on us, it is a dreamless sleep throughout which we remain awake. In dreams I have achieved everything.","I pass times, I pass silences, formless worlds pass me by.","My happiest hours are those in which I think nothing, want nothing, when I do not even dream, but lose myself in some spurious vegetable torpor, moss growing on the surface of life. Without a trace of bitterness I savour my absurd awareness of being nothing, a mere foretaste of death and extinction.","In today\'s life, the world belongs only to the stupid, the insensitive and the agitated. The right to live and triumph is now conquered almost by the same means by which you conquer internment in an asylum: the inability to think, amorality and hiperexcitation.","We worship perfection because we can\'t have it; if we had it, we would reject it. Perfection is inhuman, because humanity is imperfect.","To kill our dream life would be to kill ourselves, to mutilate our soul. Dreaming is the one thing we have that\'s really ours, invulnerably and inalterably ours.","Between me and life is a faint glass. No matter how sharply I see and understand life, I cannot touch it.","There\'s a non-existent peace in the uncertain quietness","We are two abysses - a well staring at the sky.","Writing is like paying myself a formal visit.","Everything around me is evaporating. My whole life, my memories, my imagination and its contents, my personality - it\'s all evaporating. I continuously feel that I was someone else, that I felt something else, that I thought something else. What I\'m attending here is a show with another set. And the show I\'m attending is myself.","I crave time in all its duration, and I want to be myself unconditionally.","Being tired of all illusions and of everything about illusions \u2013 the loss of illusions, the uselessness of having them, the prefatigue of having to have them in order to lose them, the sadness of having had them, the intellectual shame of having had them knowing that they would have to end this way.","I am the escaped one, After I was born They locked me up inside me But I left. My soul seeks me, Through hills and valley, I hope my soul Never finds me.","To love is to tire of being alone; it is therefore a cowardice, a betrayal of ourselves. (It is exceedingly important that we not love.)","Ah, it\'s my longing for whom I might have been that distracts and torments me!","I always live in the present. I don\u2019t know the future and no longer have the past. The former oppresses me as the possibility of everything, the latter as the reality of nothing.","Could it think, the heart would stop beating.","My dreams are a stupid refuge, like an umbrella against a thunderbolt.","To be understood is to prostitute oneself","Destiny gave me only two things: a few accounting books and the gift of dreaming.","The human soul is an abyss","I\'m the empty stage where various actors act out various plays.","In this metallic age of barbarians, only a relentless cultivation of our ability to dream, to analyse and to captivate can prevent our personality from degenerating into nothing or else into a personality like all the rest.","Inch by inch I conquered the inner terrain I was born with. Bit by bit I reclaimed the swamp in which I\'d languished. I gave birth to my infinite being, but I had to wrench myself out of me with forceps.","And I, who timidly hate life, fear death with fascination. I fear this nothingness that could be something else, and I fear it as nothing and as something else simultaneously, as if gross horror and non-existence could coincide there, as if my coffin could entrap the eternal breathing of a bodily soul, as if immortality could be tormented by confinement. The idea of hell, which only a satanic soul could have invented seems to me to have derived from this sort of confusion - a mixture of two different fears that contradict and contaminate each other.","I am the outskirts of some non-existent town, the long-winded prologue to an unwritten book. I\'m nobody, nobody. I don\'t know how to feel or think or love. I\'m a character in a novel as yet unwritten, hovering in the air and undone before I\'ve even existed, amongst the dreams of someone who never quite managed to breath life into me.","For I am the size of what I see / not my height\'s size.","Myth is the nothing that is all.","To be great, be whole; Exclude nothing, exaggerate nothing that is not you. Be whole in everything. Put all you are Into the smallest thing you do. So, in each lake, the moon shines with splendor Because it blooms up above.","I realize that, while often happy and often cheerful, I am always sad.","I\'m astounded whenever I finish something. Astounded and distressed. My perfectionist instinct should inhibit me from finishing; it should inhibit me from even beginning. But I get distracted and start doing something. What I achieve is not the product of an act of my will but of my will\'s surrender. I begin because I don\'t have the strength to think; I finish because I don\'t have the courage to quit. This book is my cowardice.","The inventor of the mirror poisoned the human heart.","To feel today what one felt yesterday isn\'t to feel - it\'s to remember today what was felt yesterday, to be today\'s living corpse of what yesterday was lived and lost.","Look, there\'s no metaphysics on earth but chocolates.","Given that we cannot know all the elements in a problem, we never can solve it.","The end of lower art is to please, the end of average art is to raise the top, the end of superior art is to free.","Give to each emotion a personality, to each state of mind a soul.","Decadence is the total loss of unconsciousness, which is the very basis of life. Could it think, the heart would stop beating.","Let us sculpt in hopeless silence all our dreams of speaking.","Oh salty sea, how much of your salt Is tears from Portugal?","The sea with an end can be Greek or Roman: the endless sea is Portuguese.","Should I be what I think? But I think about being so many things!","If I write what I feel, it\'s to reduce the fever of feeling. What I confess is unimportant, because everything is unimportant.","There are metaphors more real than the people who walk in the street.","I\'m sick of everything, and of the everythingness of everything.","Without madness what is man But a wholesome beast, Postponed corpse that begets?","La literatura es la manera m\xe1s agradable de ignorar la vida.","And, like the great damned souls, I shall always feel that thinking is worth more than living.","I\'ve never done anything but dream. This, and this alone, has been the meaning of my life. My only real concern has been my inner life.","I never meant to be but a dreamer.","We all have two lives: The true, the one we dreamed of in childhood And go on dreaming of as adults in a substratum of mist; the false, the one we love when we live with others, the practical, the useful, the one we end up by being put in a coffin.","I sometimes think that I enjoy suffering. But the truth is I would prefer something else.","Humanitarianism is rude.","My soul is impatient with itself, as with a bothersome child; its restlessness keeps growing and is forever the same. Everything interests me, but nothing holds me. I attend to everything, dreaming all the while.","The unnatural and the strange have a perfume of their own","We live by action\u2014by acting on desire. Those of us who don\'t know how to want\u2014whether geniuses or beggars\u2014are related by impotence.","I believe that saying a thing is to keep its virtues and take away its terror.","If life has given us no more than a prison cell, let\'s at least decorate it as best we can-with the shadows of our dreams, their colourful patterns engraving our oblivion on the static surface of the walls.","One never lives so intensely as when one has been thinking hard.","But do we really live? To live without knowing what life is - is that living?","To have opinions is to sell out to youself. To have no opinions is to exist. To have every opinion is to be a poet.","I am tired of myself in every way. All things, deep down to the secret of their roots, are stained by the color of my weariness.","There is no happiness without knowledge. But knowledge of happiness is unhappy; for knowing ourselves happy is knowing ourselves passing through happiness, and having to, immediatly at once, leave it behind. To know is to kill, in happiness as in everything. Not to know, though, is not to exist.","Our problem isn\'t that we\'re individualists. It\'s that our individualism is static rather than dynamic. We value what we think rather than what we do. We forget that we haven\'t done, or been, what we thought; that the first function of life is action, just as the first property of things is motion.","The essence of what I desire is simply this: to sleep away life.","All I\u2019ve ever done is dream. That, and only that, has been the meaning of my existence. The only thing I\u2019ve ever really cared about is my inner life. My greatest griefs faded to nothing the moment I opened the window onto my inner self and lost myself in watching. I never tried to be anything other than a dreamer. I never paid any attention to people who told me to go out and live. I belonged always to whatever was far from me and to whatever I could never be. Anything that was not mine, however base, always seemed to be full of poetry. The only thing I ever loved was pure nothingness.","Sailing is necessary, living is not necessary.","Nature is the difference between the soul and God.","I don\'t know what I feel or what I want to feel. I don\'t know what to think or what I am.","I asked for very little from life, and even this little was denied me. A nearby field, a ray of sunlight, a little bit of calm along with a bit of bread, not to feel oppressed by the knowledge that I exist, not to demand anything from others, and not to have others demand anything from me - this was denied me, like the spare change we might deny a beggar not because we\'re mean-hearted but because we don\'t feel like unbuttoning our coat.","I look at myself but I\'m missing. I know myself: it\u2019s not me.","Strength without agility is a mere mass.","The beauty of a naked body is felt only by the dressed races.","Ah, what a morning this is, awakening me to life\'s stupidity. [98 - Zenith trans.]","It\'s been months since I last wrote. I\'ve lived in a state of mental slumber, leading the life of someone else. I\'ve felt, very often, a vicarious happiness. I haven\'t existed. I\'ve been someone else. I\'ve lived without thinking.","My soul\'s the present shadow of a presence gone.","Lord, may the pain be ours, And the weakness that it brings, But at least give us the strength, Of not showing it to anyone!","Nostalgia! I feel it even for someone who meant nothing to me, out of anxiety for the flight of time and a sickness bred of the mystery of life. If one of the faces I pass daily on the streets disappears, I feel sad; yet they meant nothing to me, other than being a symbol of all life.","I search and can\'t find myself. I belong in chrysanthemum time, sharp in calla lily elongations. God made my soul into an ornamental thing.","Having touched Christ\'s feet is not an excuse for punctuation mistakes.","I asked for very little from life, and even this little was denied me.","We almost always live outside ourselves, and life itself is a continual dispersion. But it\'s towards ourselves that we tend, as towards a centre around which, like planets, we trace absurd and distant ellipses.","...the painful intensity of my sensations, even when they\'re happy ones; the blissful intensity of my sensations, even when they\'re sad.","Every gesture is a revolutionary act.","Never read a book to the end, nor even in sequence and without skipping.","Better to dream than to be.","Life is whatever we conceive it to be.","Blessed are those who entrust their lives to no one.","There\'s a tiredness of abstract inteligence, and it\'s the most horrible of tirednesses. It doesn\'t weight on you like the tiredness of the body, nor does it worry you like the tiredness of knowledge and emotion. It\'s a weightiness of the conscience of the world, an inability of the soul to breathe.","I know nothing and my heart aches","The superiority of the dreamer is that dreaming is much more practical than living, and that the dreamer extracts from life a much vaster and varied pleasure than the action man. In better and more direct words, the dreamer is the real action man.","To think is to destroy. The very process of thought indicates it for the same thought, as thinking is decomposing.","In the ordinary jumble of my literary drawer, I sometimes find texts I wrote ten, fifteen, or even more years ago. And many of them seem to me written by a stranger: I simply do not recognize myself in them. There was a person who wrote them, and it was I. I experienced them, but it was in another life, from which I just woke up, as if from someone else\'s dream.","I think of life as an inn where I have to stay until the abyss coach arrives. I don\'t know where it will take me, for I know nothing.","But I am not perfect in my way of putting things Because I lack the divine simplicity Of being only what I appear to be.","Whether or not they exist we are slaves to our gods.","I know not what tomorrow will bring.","To need to dominate others is to need others. The commander is dependent.","Everyone has his vanity, and each one\'s vanity is his forgetting that there are others with an equal soul.","It\'s not demons (who at least have a human face) but Hell itself that seems to be laughing inside me, it\'s the croaking madness of the dead universe, the spinning cadaver of physical space, the end of all worlds blowing blackly in the wind, formless and timeless, without a God who created it, without even its own self, impossibly whirling in the absolute darkness as the one and only reality, everything.","Once we\'re able to see this world as an illusion and a phantasm, then we can see everything that happens to us as a dream, as something that pretended to exist while we were sleeping. And we will become subtly and profoundly indifferent towards all of life\'s setbacks and calamities. Those who die turned a corner, which is why we\'ve stopped seeing them; those who suffer pass before us like a nightmare, if we feel, or like an unpleasant daydream, if we think. And even our own suffering won\'t be more than this nothingness.","It is noble to be shy, illustrious not to know how to act, great not to have a gift for living.","Life is an experimental journey undertaken involuntarily. It is a journey of the spirit through the material world and, since it is the spirit that travels, it is the spirit that is experienced. That is why there exist contemplative souls who have lived more intensely, more widely, more tumultuously than others who have lived their lives purely externally. The end result is what matters. What one felt was what one experienced. One retires to bed as wearily from having dreamed as from having done hard physical labor. One never lives so intensely as when one has been thinking hard.","In the very corner of my soul there is an altar to a different god.","This world is for those who are born to conquer it, Not for those who dream that are able to conquer it, even if they\'re right.","When one of my Japanese teacups is broken, I imagine that the real cause was not the careless hand of a maid but the anxieties of the figures inhabiting the curves of that porcelain. Their grim decision to commit suicide doesn\'t shock me: they used the maid as one of us might use a gun.","I carry my awareness of defeat like a banner of victory.","To create, I destroyed myself; I made myself external to such a degree within myself that within myself I do not exist except in an external fashion. I am the living setting in which several actors make entrances, putting on several different plays.","Who am I to myself? Just a feeling of mine.","I\'m something that I used to be. I\'m never where I feel I am, and if I seek myself, I don\'t know who\'s seeking me. My boredom with everything has numbed me. I feel banished from my soul.","Art lies because it\'s social.","Every spoken word double-crosses us. The written word is the only tolerable form of communication, as it isn\'t a stone in a bridge between souls but a ray of light between stars.","Friends: not one. Just a few acquaintances who imagine they feel something for me and who might be sorry if a train ran over me and the funeral was on a rainy day.","Sadly I write in my quiet room, alone as I have always been, alone as I will always be. And I wonder if my apparently negligible voice might not embody the essence of thousands of voices, the longing for self expression of thousands of lives, the patience of millions of souls resigned like my own to their daily lot, their useless dreams, and their hopeless hopes.","What is art but the denial of life?","Silence emerges from the sound of rain and spreads in a crescendo of gray monotony over the narrow street I contemplate. I\u2019m sleeping while awake, standing by the window, leaning against it as against everything. I search in myself for the sensations I feel before these falling threads of darkly luminous water that stand out from the grimy building facades and especially from the open windows. And I don\u2019t know what I feel or what I want to feel. I don\u2019t know what to think or where I am.","But my sadness is comforting Because it\u2019s right and natural And because it\u2019s what the soul should feel When it already thinks it exists And the hand pick flowers And the soul takes no notice.","I\'ve always been an ironic dreamer, unfaithful to my inner promises. Like a complete outsider, a casual observer of whom I thought I was, I\'ve always enjoyed watching my daydreams go down in defeat. I was never convinced of what I believed in. I filled my hands with sand, called it gold, and opened them up to let it slide through. Words were my only truth. When the right words were said, all was done; the rest was the sand that had always been.","THIRD WATCHER Let her speak. Don\'t interrupt. She knows words that mermaids taught her...I\'m falling asleep in order to hear her...Go on, sister, go on...My heart aches because I wasn\'t you when you dreamed at the seashore.","Giving importance to what we think because we thought it, taking our own selves not only (to quote the Greek philosopher) as the measure of all things but as their norm or standard, we create in ourselves, if not an interpretation, at least a criticism of the universe, which we don\'t even know and therefore cannot criticize. The giddiest, most weak-minded of us then promote that criticism to an interpretation that\'s superimposed, like a hallucination; induced rather than deduced. It\'s a hallucination in the strict sense, being an illusion based on something only dimly seen.","I have at this moment so many fundamental thoughts, so many truly metaphysical things to say, that I suddenly get tired and decide not to write any more, not to think any more, but to allow the fever of speaking to make me sleepy, and with my eyes closed, like a cat, I play with everything I could have said.","After the rains departed the skies and settled on earth - clear skies; moist brilliant earth - greater clarity returned to life alone with the blue above and made the world below rejoice with the freshness of the recent rain. It left heaven in our souls and a freshness in our hearts.","Smell is a strange sight. It evokes sentimental landscapes through a sudden sketching of the subconscious.","What is a disease is wishing with an equal intensity what is needed and what is desirable, and suffer for not being perfect as you would suffer for not having bread. The romantic error is this wanting the moon as if there was a way to get it.","Direct experience is the evasion, or hiding place of those devoid of imagination.","Changing from the ghosts of faith to the spectres of reason is just changing cells.","Art gives us the illusion of liberation from the sordid business of being.","I read and am liberated. I acquire objectivity. I cease being myself and so scattered. And what I read, instead of being like a nearly invisible suit that sometimes oppresses me, is the external world\u2019s tremendous and remarkable clarity, the sun that sees everyone, the moon that splotches the still earth with shadows, the wide expanses that end in the sea, the blackly solid trees whose tops greenly wave, the steady peace of ponds on farms, the terraced slopes with their paths overgrown by grape-vines.","To know nothing about yourself is to live. To know yourself badly is to think.","I\u2019ve always wanted to be liked. It grieved me that I was treated with indifference. Left an orphan by Fortune, I wanted\u2014like all orphans\u2014to be the object of someone\u2019s affection. This need has always been a hunger that went unsatisfied, and so thoroughly have I adapted to this inevitable hunger that I sometimes wonder if I really feel the need to eat. Whatever be the case, life pains me.","To think is to destroy.","I never go to where\'s a risk. I\'m frightened of dangers down to boredom.","Again I see you, But me I don\'t see!, The magical mirror in which I saw myself has been broken, And only a piece of me I see in each fatal fragment - Only a piece of you and me!","On the road halfway between faith and criticism stands the inn of reason. Reason is faith in what can be understood without faith, but it\'s still a faith, since to understand presupposes that there\'s something understandable.","I seek and don\u2019t find myself. I belong to chrysanthemum hours, neatly lined up in flowerpots.","When I write, I solemnly visit myself.","Everything stated or expressed by man is a note in the margin of a completely erased text. From what\'s in the note we can extract the gist of what must have been in the text, but there\'s always a doubt, and the possible meanings are many.","I belong to a generation - assuming that this generation includes others besides me - that lost its faith in the gods of the old religions as well as in the gods of modern nonreligions. I reject Jehova as I reject humanity.","I realize that I was all error and deviation, that I never lived, that I existed only in so far as I filled time with consciousness and thought.","What\'s most worthless about dreams is that everybody has them.","The poet is a pretender. / He pretends so completely, / that he even pretends that it is pain / the pain he really feels.","I never had anyone I could call \u201cMaster\u201d. No Christ died for me. No Buddha showed me the right path. In the depths of my dreams no Apollo or Athena appeared to me to enlighten my soul","Faithful to the word given and the idea had.","Everything is theater.","I\'m going to end a life that I thought could contain every kind of greatness but that in fact consisted only of my incapacity to really want to be great. Whenever I arrived at a certainty, I remembered that those with the greatest certainties are lunatics.","Since I wasn\'t able to leave a succession of beautiful lies, I want to leave the smidgen of truth that the falsehood of everything lets us suppose we can tell.","Yes, talking to people makes me sleepy.","There\u2019s enough metaphysics in not thinking about anything.","Never having discovered qualities in myself which could attract someone else, I could never believe that anyone felt attracted to me.","Let\'s buy books so as not to read them; let\'s go to concerts without caring to hear the music or see who\'s there; let\'s take long walks because we\'re sick of walking; and let\'s spend whole days in the country, just because it bores us.","Contradiction is the essence of the universe.","I\'d like to be in the country so that I\'d could like being in the city.","Time, which grays hair and wrinkles faces, also withers violent affections, and much more quickly.","Today I suddenly experienced an absurd but quite valid sensation. I realized, in an intimate lightning flash, that I am no one. No one, absolutely no one.","I will be what I want. But I will have to want what I\'ll be. Success is in having success, not conditions for success.","I enjoy wording. Words for me are tangible bodies, visible sirens, incarnate sensualities.","God gave the sea the danger and the abyss, but it was in it that He mirrored the sky.","There are those that even God exploits, and they are prophets and saints in the vacuousness of the world.","I don\'t believe in the landscape.","Wasting time has an esthetics to it.","Property isn\'t theft: it\'s nothing.","There\'s something vile (and all the more vile because ridiculous) in the tendency of feeble men to make universal tragedies out of the sad comedies of their private woes.","And I have the others in me. Even when I\u2019m far away from them, I am forced to live with them. Even when I\u2019m all alone, crowds surround me. I have no place to flee to, unless I were to flee from myself.","If after I die, people want to write my biography, there is nothing simpler. They only need two dates: the date of my birth and the date of my death. Between one and another, every day is mine.","I want to be a work of art, at least in my soul, since I can\u2019t be one in my body.","Ser compreendido \xe9 prostituir-se.","Being a retired major looks like an ideal thing to me. What a pity you couldn\'t eternally have been just a retired major.","I had the same sensation as when we watch someone sleep. When asleep we all become children again. Perhaps because in the state of slumber we can do no wrong and are unconscious of life, the greatest criminal and most self- absorbed egotist are holy, by a natural magic, as long as they\'re sleeping. For me there\'s no discernible difference between killing a child and killing a sleeping man.","My joy is as painful as my pain.","We may know that the work we continue to put off doing will be bad. Worse, however, is the work we never do. A work that\u2019s finished is at least finished. It may be poor, but it exists, like the miserable plant in the lone flowerpot of my neighbour who\u2019s crippled. That plant is her happiness, and sometimes it\u2019s even mine. What I write, bad as it is, may provide some hurt or sad soul a few moments of distraction from something worse. That\u2019s enough for me, or it isn\u2019t enough, but it serves some purpose, and so it is with all of life.","I look for myself but find no one. I belong to the chrysanthemum hour of bright flowers placed in tall vases. I should make an ornament of my soul.","As I walk, I construct perfect sentences that I cannot remember later at home. I don\u2019t know if the ineffable poetry of those sentences derived from what they were or from their never having been (written).","I take with me the conscience of defeat as a victory banner.","Nobody appropriates novelties as readily as the Portuguese.","Let\'s absurdify life, from east to west. Let us play hide-and-seek with our consciousness of living.","And let our despite go to those who work and fight and our hate to those who hope and trust.","It\'s in an inland sea that the river of my life ended.","Each of us is several, is many,is a profusion of selves. So that the self who disdains his surroundings is not the same as the self who suffers or takes joy in them. In the vast colony of our being there are many species of people who think and feel in different ways. Livro Do Desassossego","To choose ways of not acting was ever the concern and scruple of my life.","There\'s no greater tragedy than an equal intensity, in the same soul or the same man, of the intellectual sentiment and the moral sentiment. For a man to be utterly and absolutely moral, he has to be a bit stupid. For a man to be absolutely intellectual, he has to be a bit immoral.","My curiosity sister of larks.","All of this passes, and none of it means anything to me.It\'s all foreign to my fate, and even to fate as a whole. It\'sjust unconsciousness, curses of protest when chance hurlsstones, echoes of unknown voices - a collectivemishmash of life.","Through an experience that simultaneously involved my sensibility and intelligence, I realized early on that the imaginative life, however morbid it might seem, is the one that suits temperaments like mine. The fictions of my imagination (as it later developed) may weary me, but they don\'t hurt or humiliate. Impossible lovers can\'t cheat on us, or smile at us falsely, or be calculating in their caresses. They never forsake us, and they don\'t die or disappear. --The book of Disquiet","My hapless peers with their lofty dreams--how I envy and despise them! I\'m with the others, the even more hapless, who have no-one but themselves to whom they can tell their dreams and show what would be verses if they wrote them. I\'m with those poor slobs who have no books to show, who have no literature beside their own soul, and who are suffocating to death due to the fact that they exist without having taken that mysterious, transcendental exam that makes one eligible to live.","What can I expect from myself? My sensation in all their horrible acuity, and a profound awareness of feeling. A sharp mind that only destroys me, and an unusual capacity for dreaming to keep me entertained. A dead will and a reflection that cradles it, like a living child. From, The Book of Disquiet","I feel closer ties and more intimate bonds with certain characters in books, with certain images I\u2019ve seen in engravings, than with many supposedly real people with the metaphysical absurdity known as \u2018flesh and blood\u2019. In fact, \u2018flesh and blood\u2019 describes them very well: they resemble cuts of meat laid out on the butcher\u2019s marble slab, dead creatures bleeding as though still alive.","FIRST WATCHER Why do people die? SECOND WATCHER Perhaps because they don\'t dream enough.","I\u2019m losing my taste for everything, including even my taste for finding everything tasteless.","There is no safe standard to tell man from animals.","Isn\'t joyful or painful this pain in which I rejoice","All pleasure is a vice, for seeking pleasure is what everybody does in life, and the only dark vice is doing what everybody does.","All that I\'ve lived I\'ve forgotten, as if I\'d vaguely heard it. All that I\'ll be reminds me of nothing, as if I\'d lived and forgotten it.","Life is a thread that someone entangled.","Life hurls us like a stone, and we sail through the air saying, \\"look at me move.","I was a poet animated by philosophy, not a philosopher with poetic faculties.","Success consists in being successful, not in having potential for success. Any wide piece of ground is the potential site of a palace, but there\'s no palace till it\'s built.","I don\'t mourn the loss of my childhood; I mourn because everything, including (my) childhood, is lost.","Whenever someone tells me he dreamed, I wonder if he realizes that he has never done anything but dream.","The startling reality of things is my discovery every single day.","If, on thinking this, I look up to see if reality can quench my thirst, I see inexpressive facades, inexpressive faces, inexpressive gestures. Stones, bodies, ideas - all dead. All movements are one great standstill. Nothing means anything to me, not because it\'s unfamiliar but because I don\'t know what it is. The world has slipped away. And in the bottom of my soul - as the only reality of this moment - there\'s an intense and invisible grief, a sadness like the sound of someone crying in a dark room.","I sometimes think, with a sad delight, that if one day, in a future I no longer belong to, these sentences, that I write, last with praise, I will at last have the people who understand me, those mine, the true family to be born in and be loved... I will only be understood in effigy, when affection no longer repays the dead the unaffection that was, when living.","For a long time now I haven\'t existed. I\'m utterly calm. No one distinguishes me from who I am. I just felt myself breath as if I\'d done something new, or done it late. I\'m beginning to be conscious of being conscious. Perhaps tomorrow I will wake up to myself and resume the course of my existence. I don\'t know if that will make more happy or less. I don\'t know anything.","What\'s given, in fact, always depends on the person or thing it\'s given to. A minor incident in the street brings the cook to the door and entertains him more than I would be entertained by contemplating the most original idea, by reading the greatest book, or by having the most gratifying of useless dreams. If life is basically monotony, he has escaped it more than I. And he escapes it more easily than I. The truth isn\'t with him or with me, because it isn\'t with anyone, but happiness does belong to him.","The principle tragedy of my life is, like all tragedies, an irony of Destiny. I reject real life as if it were a condemnation; I reject dreams as if they were an ignoble liberation. [...]After the end of the stars uselessly whitened in the morning sky and the breeze became less cold in the barely orange tinged in the yellow of the light on the scattered low clouds, I, who hadn\'t slept, could finally, slowly raise my body, exhausted from nothing from the bed from which I had thought the universe.","When all by myself, I can think of all kinds of clever remarks, quick comebacks to what no one said, and flashes of witty sociability with nobody. But all of this vanishes when I face someone in the flesh: I lose my intelligence, I can no longer speak, and after half an hour I just feel tired. Talking to people makes me feel like sleeping. Only my ghostly and imaginary friends, only the conversations I have in my dreams, are genuinely real and substantial.","To say! To know how to say! To know how to exist via the written voice and the intellectual image! This is all that matters in life; the rest is men and women, imagined loves and factitious vanities, the wiles of our digestion and forgetfulness, people squirming \u2014 like worms when a rock is lifted \u2014 under the huge abstract boulder of the meaningless blue sky.","Tomorrow I too \u2013 this feeling and thinking soul, the universe I am to myself \u2013 yes, tomorrow I too will be someone who no longer walks these streets, someone others will evoke with a vague: \'I wonder what\'s become of him?\u201d And everything I do, everything I feel, everything I experience, will be just one less passer-by on the daily streets of some city or other.","The perfect man of pagans was the perfection of the man there is; the perfect man of christians, the perfection of the man there isn\'t; the buddhists\' perfect man, the perfection of not existing a man.","That is my morality or my metaphysics or me myself: a passer-by in everything, even my own soul. I belong to nothing, I desire nothing, I am nothing except an abstract centre of impersonal sensations, a sentient mirror fallen from the wall but still turned to reflect the diversity of the world.","The supreme empire is that of the Emperor who renounces all normal life, that of other men, and in who the care of supremacy doesn\'t weigh like a load of jewels.","My boredom with everything has numbed me.","Multipliquei-me para me sentir.","pg 9, \\"The consciousness of life\'s unconsciousness is the oldest tax levied on the intelligence.","And leaning out the window, enjoying the day above the varying volume of the entire city, only one thought swells my soul \u2013 the intimate will to die, to finish, not to see more light over any city, not to think, not to feel, to leave behind like wrapping paper the course of the sun and the days, to rid myself, at the edge of the grand bed, as of a heavy suit, of the involuntary effort to be.","Let\'s develop theories, patiently and honestly thinking them out, in order to promptly act against them \u2013 acting and justifying our actions with new theories that condemn them. Let\'s cut a path in life and then go immediately against that path. Let\'s adopt all the poses and gestures of something we aren\'t and don\'t even wish to be, and don\'t even wish to taken for being.","The Gods sell when they give. Glory is paid for with disgrace. Poor are the happy, for they are Just what passes.","At first I felt dizzy - not with the kind of dizziness that makes the body reel but the kind that\'s like a dead emptiness in the brain, an instinctive awareness of the void.","I walk along a street and see in the faces of the passersby not the expression they really have but the expression they would have for me if they knew about my life and how I am, if I carried, transparent in my gestures and my face, the ridiculous, timid abnormality of my soul.","My homeland is the portuguese language.","Walking on these streets, until the night falls, my life feels to me like the life they have. By day they\u2019re full of meaningless activity; by night, they\u2019re full of meaningless lack of it. By day I am nothing, and by night I am I. There is no difference between me and these streets, save they being streets and I a soul, which perhaps is irrelevant when we consider the essence of things","The house clock, place certain there at the bottom of things, strikes the half hour dry and null. All is so much, all is so deep, all is so dark and cold!","For valuing your own suffering sets on it the gold of a sun of pride. Suffering a lot can originate the illusion of being the Chosen of Pain.","Fraternity has subtleties.","A great emotion is too selfish ; it takes into itself all the blood of the spirit, and the congestion leaves the hands too cold to write. Three sorts of emotion produce great poetry - strong but quick emotions, seized upon for art as soon as they have passed, but not before they have passed ; strong and deep emotions in their remembrance along time after ; and false emotions, that is to say, emotions felt in the intellect. Not insincerity, but a translated sincerity, is the basis of all art.","To live is to be someone else. Feeling is impossible if we feel today as we felt yesterday: to feel today the same thing we felt yesterday is not to feel at all--it\'s merely to remember today what we felt yesterday, since today we are the living cadaver of yesterday\'s lost life.","The slope takes you to the windmill, but effort takes you nowhere.","pg.9 \\"In my heart there\'s a peaceful anguish, and my calm is made of resignation.","I Know, I Alone I know, I alone How much it hurts, this heart With no faith nor law Nor melody nor thought. Only I, only I And none of this can I say Because feeling is like the sky - Seen, nothing in it to see.","The abstract intelligence produces a fatigue that\'s the worst of all fatigues. It doesn\'t weigh on us like bodily fatigue, nor disconcert like the fatigue of emotional experience. It\'s the weight of our consciousness of the world, a shortness of breath in our soul.","Civilization consists in giving something an unfitting name, then dream about the result. And indeed the false name and the real dream create a new reality. The object really becomes another, because we turned it into another one. We manufacture realities.","To narrate is to create, for living is just being lived.","What Hells and Purgatories and Heavens I have inside of me! But who sees me do anything that disagrees with life--me, so calm and peaceful?","Attention to detail and a perfectionist instinct, far from stimulating action, are character qualities that lead to renunciation. Better to dream than to be.","Action men are the unvoluntary slaves of wise men.","Everything is absurd.","The end is low, like all quantitative ends, personal or not, and it can be attained and verified.","Only sterility is noble and dignified. Only killing what never was is elevated and perverse and absurd.","Against destiny I fulfilled my duty. Uselessly? No, for I fulfilled it.","Your poems are of interest to mankind; your liver isn\'t. Drink till you write well and feel sick. Bless your poems and be damned to you.","To live strikes me as a metaphysical mistake of matter, a dereliction of inaction.","Man shouldn\'t be able to see his own face. That\'s what\'s most terrible. Nature gave him the possibility of not seeing it, as well as the incapacity of not seeing his own eyes.","The idea of any social obligation ... just the idea of it embarasses my thoughts for a day, and sometimes it\'s since the day before that I worry, and don\'t sleep well, and the real affair, when it happens, is absolutely insignificant and justifies nothing; and the case repeats itself and I never learn to learn.","Should you ask me if I\'m happy, I\'ll answer that I\'m not.","If a man can only write well when drunk, I\'ll tell him: get drunk. And if he tells me that his liver suffers with it, I\'ll answer: what\'s your liver? It\'s a dead thing that lives as long as you live, and the poems you\'ll write will live without a as long as.","I don\'t write in Portuguese. I write myself.","A being who, as I grew older, lost imagination, emotion, a type of intelligence, a way of feeling things - all that which, while it made me sorry, did not horrify me. But what am I experiencing when I read myself as if I were someone else? On which bank am I standing if I see myself in the depths?","I come closer to my desk as to a bulwark against life.","I\'m upset by the happiness of all these men who don\'t know they\'re unhappy. Because of that, though, I love them all. Dear vegetables!","What has happened to us has happened to everyone or only to us; if to everyone, then it\'s no novelty, and if only to us, then it won\'t be understood.","We, all who live, have A life that is lived And another life that is thought, And the only life we have It\'s the one that is divided In right or wrong.","In any spirit that isn\'t deformed there is the belief in God. In any spirit that is not deformed there isn\'t the belief in a particular God.","All beginnings are involuntary.","I never cared about whatever tragic event happened in China. It\'s faraway decoration, even if in blood and plague.","I am the suburb of a non-existent town, the prolix commentary on a book never written. I am nobody, nobody. I am a character in a novel which remains to be written, and I float, aerial, scattered without ever having been, among the dreams of a creature who did not know how to finish me off.","The chill of what I won\'t feel gnaws at my present heart.","If this be to have sense, if to be awake Be but to see this bright, great sleep of things, For the rarer potion mine own dreams I\'ll take And for truth commune with imaginings","And as well as I dream, I reason if I want, for that\'s just another kind of dream.","One or another man, liberated or cursed, suddenly sees-but even this man sees rarely-that all we are is what we aren\'t, that we fool ourselves about what\'s true and are wrong about what we conclude is right. And this man, who in a flash sees the universe naked, creates a philosophy or dreams up a religion; and the philosophy spreads and the religion propagates, and those who believe in the philosophy begin to wear it as a suit they don\'t see, and those who believe in the religion put it on as a mask they soon forget.","Everything I sought in life I abandoned for the sake of the search. I\'m like one who absentmindedly looks for he doesn\'t know what, having forgotten it in his dreaming as the search got under way.","Liberty is the possibility of isolation.","If I had written King Lear, I would regret it all my life afterwards. Because that work is so big, that its defects show as huge, its monstrous defects, things even minimal in between some scenes and their possible perfection. It\'s not the sun with spots; it\'s a broken greek statue.","I never was but an isolated bon vivant, which is absurd; or a mystic bon vivant, which is an impossible thing.","Talking to people makes me feel like sleeping. Only my ghostly and imaginary friends, only the conversations I have in my dreams, are genuinely real and substantial.","These pages are not my confession; they\u2019re my definition. And I feel, as I begin to write it, that I can write it with some semblance of truth.","I\'ve reached the point where tedium is a person, the incarnate fiction of my own company.","You breathe better when you\'re rich.","We\u2019ve been devastated by the severest and deadliest drought in history \u2013 that of our profound awareness of the futility of all effort and the vanity of all plans.","To have defined and sure opinions, fixed and known instincts, passions and character - all that is the horror of turning our soul into a fact, materialize it and make it external.","I\'m a man for whom the outside world is an inner Reality.","God wills, man dreams, the work is born.","No intelligent idea can gain general acceptance unless some stupidity is mixed in with it","My soul is impatient with itself, as with a bothersome child; its restlessness keeps growing and is forever the same. Everything interests me, but nothing holds me. I attend to everything, dreaming all the while. [\u2026]. I\'m two, and both keep their distance \u2014 Siamese twins that aren\'t attached.","I am nothing.I\'ll never be anything.I couldn\'t want to be something.Apart from that, I have in me all the dreams in the world.","To be great, be whole;Exclude nothing, exaggerate nothing that is not you.Be whole in everything. Put all you areInto the smallest thing you do.So, in each lake, the moon shines with splendorBecause it blooms up above.","N\xe3o sou nada. Nunca serei nada. N\xe3o posso querer ser nada. \xc0 parte isso, tenho em mim todos os sonhos do mundo.","I\'ve always been an ironic dreamer, unfaithful to my inner promises.Like a complete outsider, a casual observer of whom I thought I was,I\'ve always enjoyed watching my daydreams go down in defeat.I was never convinced of what I believed in.I filled my hands with sand, called it gold, and opened them up to let it slide through.Words were my only truth.When the right words were said, all was done; the rest was the sand that had always been.","Look, there\'s no metaphysics on earth like chocolates.","Life is an experimental journey undertaken involuntarily. It is a journey of the spirit through the material world and, since it is the spirit that travels, it is the spirit that is experienced. That is why there exist contemplative souls who have lived more intensely, more widely, more tumultuously than others who have lived their lives purely externally.","I\'m astounded whenever I finish something. Astounded and distressed. My perfectionist instinct should inhibit me from finishing: it should inhibit me from even beginning. But I get distracted and start doing something. What I achieve is not the product of an act of my will but of my will\'s surrender. I begin because I don\'t have the strength to think; I finish because I don\'t have the courage to quit. This book is my cowardice.","There are metaphors more real than the people who walk in the street. There are images tucked away in books that live more vividly than many men and women. There are phrases from literary works that have a positively human personality. There are passages from my own writing that chill me with fright, so distinctly do I feel them as people, so sharply outlined do they appear against the walls of my room, at night, in shadows... I\'ve written sentences whose sound, read out loud or silently (impossible to hide their sound), can only be of something that acquired absolute exteriority and a full-fledged soul.","To write is to forget. Literature is the most agreeable way of ignoring life. Music soothes, the visual arts exhilarates, the performing arts (such as acting and dance) entertain. Literature, however, retreats from life by turning in into slumber. The other arts make no such retreat\u2014 some because they use visible and hence vital formulas, others because they live from human life itself. This isn\'t the case with literature. Literature simulates life. A novel is a story of what never was, a play is a novel without narration. A poem is the expression of ideas or feelings a language no one uses, because no one talks in verse.","But I am not perfect in my way of putting thingsBecause I lack the divine simplicityOf being only what I appear to be.","Masquerades disclose the reality of souls. As long as no one sees who we are, we can tell the most intimate details of our life. I sometimes muse over this sketch of a story about a man afflicted by one of those personal tragedies born of extreme shyness who one day, while wearing a mask I don\u2019t know where, told another mask all the most personal, most secret, most unthinkable things that could be told about his tragic and serene life. And since no outward detail would give him away, he having disguised even his voice, and since he didn\u2019t take careful note of whoever had listened to him, he could enjoy the ample sensation of knowing that somewhere in the world there was someone who knew him as not even his closest and finest friend did. When he walked down the street he would ask himself if this person, or that one, or that person over there might not be the one to whom he\u2019d once, wearing a mask, told his most private life. Thus would be born in him a new interest in each person, since each person might be his only, unknown confidant.","Having never discovered qualities in myself that might attract someone else, I could never believe that anyone felt attracted to me.","Today, suddenly, I reached an absurd but unerring conclusion. In a moment of enlightenment, I realized that I\'m nobody, absolutely nobody. When the lightning flashed, I saw that what I had thought to be a city was in fact a deserted plain and, in the same sinister light that revealed me to myself, there seemed to be no sky above it. I was robbed of any possibility of having existed before the world. If I was ever reincarnated, I must have done so without myself, without a self to reincarnate.I am the outskirts of some non-existent town, the long-winded prologue to an unwritten book. I\'m nobody, nobody. I don\'t know how to feel or think or love. I\'m a character in a novel as yet unwritten, hovering in the air and undone before I\'ve even existed, amongst the dreams of someone who never quite managed to breathe life into me.I\'m always thinking, always feeling, but my thoughts lack all reason, my emotions all feeling. I\'m falling through a trapdoor, through infinite, infinitous space, in a directionless, empty fall. My soul is a black maelstrom, a great madness spinning about a vacuum, the swirling of a vast ocean around a hole in the void, and in the waters, more like whirlwinds than waters, float images of all I ever saw or heard in the world: houses, faces, books, boxes, snatches of music and fragments of voices, all caught up in a sinister, bottomless whirlpool.And I, I myself, am the centre that exists only because the geometry of the abyss demands it; I am the nothing around which all this spins, I exist so that it can spin, I am a centre that exists only because every circle has one. I, I myself, am the well in which the walls have fallen away to leave only viscous slime. I am the centre of everything surrounded by the great nothing.And it is as if hell itself were laughing within me but, instead of the human touch of diabolical laughter, there\'s the mad croak of the dead universe, the circling cadaver of physical space, the end of all worlds drifting blackly in the wind, misshapen, anachronistic, without the God who created it, without God himself who spins in the dark of darks, impossible, unique, everything.If only I could think! If only I could feel!","Freedom is the possibility of isolation. You are free if you can withdraw from people, not having to seek them out for the sake of money, company, love, glory or curiosity, none of which can thrive in silence and solitude. If you can\'t live alone, you were born a slave. You may have all the splendours of the mind and the soul, in which case you\'re a noble slave, or an intelligent servant, but you\'re not free. And you can\'t hold this up as your own tragedy, for your birth is a tragedy of Fate alone. Hapless you are, however, if life itself so oppresses you that you\'re forced to become a slave. Hapless you are if, having been born free, with the capacity to be isolated and self-sufficient, poverty should force you to live with others.","I Know, I AloneI know, I aloneHow much it hurts, this heartWith no faith nor lawNor melody nor thought.Only I, only IAnd none of this can I sayBecause feeling is like the sky -Seen, nothing in it to see.","Man shouldn\u2019t be able to see his own face \u2013 there\u2019s nothing more sinister. Nature gave him the gift of not being able to see it, and of not being able to stare into his own eyes.Only in the water of rivers and ponds could he look at his face. And the very posture he had to assume was symbolic. He had to bend over, stoop down, to commit the ignominy of beholding himself.The inventor of the mirror poisoned the human heart.","My soul is impatient with itself, as with a bothersome child; its restlessness keeps growing and is forever the same. Everything interests me, but nothing holds me.","I am the escaped one,After I was bornThey locked me up inside meBut I left. My soul seeks me, Through hills and valley,I hope my soulNever finds me.","Se te \xe9 imposs\xedvel viver s\xf3, nasceste escravo.","What can I expect from myself?

Sit still with me and meditate on how useless effort is, how alien the will, and on how our very meditation is no more useful than effort, and no more our own than the will. Meditate too on how a life that wants nothing can have no weight in the flux of things, but a life the wants everything can likewise have no weight in the flux of things, since it cannot obtain everything, and to obtain less than everything is not worthy of souls that seek the truth.","All I\u2019ve ever done is dream. That, and only that, has been the meaning of my existence. The only thing I\u2019ve ever really cared about is my inner life. My greatest griefs faded to nothing the moment I opened the window onto my inner self and lost myself in watching.I never tried to be anything other than a dreamer. I never paid any attention to people who told me to go out and live. I belonged always to whatever was far from me and to whatever I could never be.

Horrified and desolate. My instinct for perfection should inhibit me from ever finishing anything; it should in fact inhibit me from ever beginning. But I become distracted and do things.

I understand perfectly that the man before me uttering words similar to mine and making the same gestures I make, or could make, is in some way my fellow creature. However, I feel just the same about the people in illustrations I dream up, about the characters I see in novels or the dramatis personae on the stage who speak through the actors representing them.I suppose no one truly admits the existence of another person. One might concede that the other person is alive and feels and thinks like oneself, but there will always be an element of difference, a perceptible discrepancy, that one cannot quite put one\'s finger on. There are figures from times past, fantasy-images in books that seem more real to us than these specimens of indifference-made-flesh who speak to us across the counters of bars, or catch our eye in trams, or brush past us in the empty randomness of the streets. The others are just part of the landscape for us, usually the invisible landscape of the familiar.I feel closer ties and more intimate bonds with certain characters in books, with certain images I\'ve seen in engravings, that with many supposedly real people, with that metaphysical absurdity known as \'flesh and blood\'. In fact \'flesh and blood\' describes them very well: they resemble cuts of meat laid on the butcher\'s marble slab, dead creatures bleeding as though still alive, the sirloin steaks and cutlets of Fate.I\'m not ashamed to feel this way because I know it\'s how everyone feels. The lack of respect between men, the indifference that allows them to kill others without compunction (as murderers do) or without thinking (as soldiers do), comes from the fact that no one pays due attention to the apparently abstruse idea that other people have souls too.","Again I see you, But me I don\'t see!, The magical mirror in which I saw myself has been broken, And only a piece of me I see in each fatal fragment - Only a piece of you and me!...","That is how I experience life, as apocalypse and cataclysm. Each day brings an increasing inability in myself to make the smallest gesture, even to imagine myself confronting clear, real situations. The presence of others \u2014 always such an unexpected event for the soul \u2014 grows daily more painful and distressing. Talking to others makes me shudder. If they show any interest in me, I flee. If they look at me, I tremble. I am constantly on the defensive. Life and other people bruise me.

They say there\u2019s nothing more difficult than to define a spiral in words; they claim it is necessary to use the unliterary hand, twirling it in a steadily upward direction, so that human eyes will perceive the abstract figure immanent in wire spring and a certain type of staircase. But if we remember that to say is to renew, we will have no trouble defining a spiral; it\u2019s a circle that rises without ever closing. I realize that most people would never dare to define it this way, for they suppose that defining is to say what others want us to say rather than what\u2019s required for the definition. I\u2019ll say it more accurately: a spiral is a potential circle that winds round as it rises, without ever completing itself. But no, the definition is still abstract. I\u2019ll resort to the concrete, and all will become clear: a spiral is a snake without a snake, vertically wound around nothing.  All literature is an attempt to make life real. All of us know, even when we act on what we don\u2019t know, life is absolutely unreal in its directly real form; the country, the city and our ideas are absolutely fictitious things, the offspring of our complex sensation of our own selves. Impressions are incommunicable unless we make them literary. Children are particularly literary, for they say what they feel not what someone has taught them to feel. Once I heard a child, who wished to say that he was on the verge of tears, say not \u2018I feel like crying\u2019, which is what an adult, i.e., an idiot, would say but rather, \u2019 I feel like tears.\u2019 And this phrase -so literary it would seem affected in a well-known poet, if he could ever invent it - decisively refers to the warm presence of tears about to burst from eyelids that feel the liquid bitterness. \u2018I feel like tears\u2019! The small child aptly defined his spiral. To say! To know how to say! To know how to exist via the written voice and the intellectual image! This is all that matters in life; the rest is men and women, imagined loves and factitious vanities, the wiles of our digestion and forgetfulness, people squirming- like worms when a rock is lifted - under the huge abstract boulder of the meaningless blue sky.","The cause of my profound sense of incompatibility with others is, I believe, that most people think with their feelings, whereas I feel with my thoughts.For the ordinary man, to feel is to live, and to think is to know how to live. For me, to think is to live, and to feel is merely food for thought.","Yes, everything\u2019s just fine.It\u2019s all perfectly fine.Except for one thing: it\u2019s all screwed up.","I have to choose what I detest - either dreaming which my intelligence hates, or action, which my sensibility loathes; either action, for which I wasn\'t born, or dreaming, for which no one was born. Detesting both, I choose neither; but since I must on occasion either dream or act, I mix the two things together.","Life is whatever we make it. The traveller is the journey.

To understand is to forget about loving. I know nothing more simultaneously false and telling than the statement by Leonardo da Vinci that we cannot love or hate something until we\u2019ve understood it.","I see life as a roadside inn where I have to stay until the coach from the abyss pulls up. I don\'t know where it will take me, because I don\'t know anything. I could see this inn as a prison, for I\'m compelled to wait in it; I could see it as a social center, for it\'s here that I meet others. But I\'m neither impatient nor common. I leave who will to stay shut up in their rooms, sprawled out on beds where they sleeplessly wait, and I leave who will to chat in the parlors, from where their songs and voices conveniently drift out here to me. I\'m sitting at the door, feasting my eyes and ears on the colors and sounds of the landscape, and I softly sing - for myself alone - wispy songs I compose while waiting.Night will fall on us all and the coach will pull up. I enjoy the breeze I\'m given and the soul I\'m given to enjoy it with, and I no longer question or seek. If what I write in the book of travellers can, when read by others at some future date, also entertain them on their journey, then fine. If they don\'t read it, or are not entertained, that\'s fine too.","All letters of love are Ridiculous.

Not to do evil, because it seems only fair that others enjoy the same right I demand for myself \u2013 not to be disturbed \u2013 and also because I think that the world doesn\u2019t need more than the natural evils it already has. All of us in this world are living on board a ship that is sailing from one unknown port to another, and we should treat each other with a traveller\u2019s cordiality. Not to do good, because I don\u2019t know what good is, nor even if I do it when I think I do. How do I know what evils I generate if I give a beggar money? How do I know what evils I produce if I teach or instruct? Not knowing, I refrain. And besides, I think that to help or clarify is, in a certain way, to commit the evil of interfering in the lives of others. Kindness depends on a whim of our mood, and we have no right to make others the victims of our whims, however humane or kind-hearted they may be. Good deeds are impositions; that\u2019s why I categorically abhor them.","To have opinions is to sell out to yourself. To have no opinion is to exist. To have every opinion is to be a poet.","Trago dentro do meu cora\xe7\xe3o,Como num cofre que se n\xe3o pode fechar de cheio,Todos os lugares onde estive,Todos os portos a que cheguei,Todas as paisagens que vi atrav\xe9s de janelas ou vigias,Ou de tombadilhos, sonhando,E tudo isso, que \xe9 tanto, \xe9 pouco para o que eu quero.","The existence of laws for the association of ideas, as for all intellectual operations, insults our native indiscipline.","I believe in the World as in a daisy.

To understand is to forget about loving. I know nothing more simultaneously false and telling than the statement by Leonardo da Vinci that we cannot love or hate something until we\u2019ve understood it. Solitude devastates me; company oppresses me. The presence of another person derails my thoughts; I dream of the other\u2019s presence with a strange absent-mindedness that no amount of my analytical scrutiny can define.Isolation has carved me in its image and likeness. The presence of another person \u2013 of any person whatsoever \u2013 instantly slows down my thinking, and while for a normal man contact with others is a stimulus to spoken expression and wit, for me it is a counterstimulus, if this compound word be linguistically permissible. When all by myself, I can think of all kinds of clever remarks, quick comebacks to what no one said, and flashes of witty sociability with nobody. But all of this vanishes when I face someone in the flesh: I lose my intelligence, I can no longer speak, and after half an hour I just feel tired. Yes, talking to people makes me feel like sleeping. Only my ghostly and imaginary friends, only the conversations I have in my dreams, are genuinely real and substantial, and in them intelligence gleams like an image in a mirror.The mere thought of having to enter into contact with someone else makes me nervous. A simple invitation to have dinner with a friend produces an anguish in me that\u2019s hard to define. The idea of any social obligation whatsoever \u2013 attending a funeral, dealing with someone about an office matter, going to the station to wait for someone I know or don\u2019t know \u2013 the very idea disturbs my thoughts for an entire day, and sometimes I even start worrying the night before, so that I sleep badly. When it takes place, the dreaded encounter is utterly insignificant, justifying none of my anxiety, but the next time is no different: I never learn to learn.\u2018My habits are of solitude, not of men.\u2019 I don\u2019t know if it was Rousseau or Senancour who said this.

We should see them as toothaches or calluses of life, as things that bother us but remain outside us (even though they\u2019re ours), or that only our organic existence need consider and our vital functions worry about.When we achieve this attitude, which in essence is that of the mystics, we\u2019re protected not only from the world but also from ourselves, for we\u2019ve conquered what is foreign in us, contrary and external to us, and therefore our enemy.Horace said* that the just man will remain undaunted, even if the world crumbles all around him.

The monotony of everything is merely the monotony of myself, however. Each face, even if seen just yesterday, is different today, because today isn\u2019t yesterday. Each day is the day it is, and there was never another one like it in the world. Only our soul makes the identification \u2013 a genuinely felt but erroneous identification \u2013 by which everything becomes similar and simplified. The world is a set of distinct things with varied edges, but if we\u2019re near-sighted, it\u2019s a continual and indecipherable fog. I feel like fleeing. Like fleeing from what I know, fleeing from what\u2019s mine, fleeing from what I love. I want to depart, not for impossible Indias or for the great islands south of everything, but for any place at all \u2013 village or wilderness \u2013 that isn\u2019t this place. I want to stop seeing these unchanging faces, this routine, these days. I want to rest, far removed, from my inveterate feigning. I want to feel sleep come to me as life, not as rest. A cabin on the seashore or even a cave in a rocky mountainside could give me this, but my will, unfortunately, cannot.Slavery is the law of life, and it is the only law, for it must be observed: there is no revolt possible, no way to escape it. Some are born slaves, others become slaves, and still others are forced to accept slavery. Our faint-hearted love of freedom \u2013 which, if we had it, we would all reject, unable to get used to it \u2013 is proof of how ingrained our slavery is. I myself, having just said that I\u2019d like a cabin or a cave where I could be free from the monotony of everything, which is the monotony of me \u2013 would I dare set out for this cabin or cave, knowing from experience that the monotony, since it stems from me, will always be with me? I myself, suffocating from where I am and because I am \u2013 where would I breathe easier, if the sickness is in my lungs rather than in the things that surround me? I myself, who long for pure sunlight and open country, for the ocean in plain view and the unbroken horizon \u2013 could I get used to my new bed, the food, not having to descend eight flights of stairs to the street, not entering the tobacco shop on the corner, not saying good-morning to the barber standing outside his shop? Everything that surrounds us becomes part of us, infiltrating our physical sensations and our feeling of life, and like spittle of the great Spider it subtly binds us to whatever is close, tucking us into a soft bed of slow death which is rocked by the wind. Everything is us, and we are everything, but what good is this, if everything is nothing?A ray of sunlight, a cloud whose shadow tells us it is passing, a breeze that rises, the silence that follows when it ceases, one or another face, a few voices, the incidental laughter of the girls who are talking, and then night with the meaningless, fractured hieroglyphs of the stars.","And I don\'t know what I feel or what I want to feel.

But tedium, even more than all that, is a boredom with other worlds, whether real or imaginary; the discomfort of having to keep living, albeit as someone else in some other way, in some other world; weariness not only of yesterday and today but also of tomorrow and of eternity, if such exists, or of nothingness, if that\'s what eternity is. It\'s not only the emptiness of things and living beings that troubles the soul afflicted by tedium, it\'s also the emptiness of the very soul that feels this vacuum, that feels itself to be this vacuum, and that within this vacuum is nauseated and repelled by its own self.","The poet is a faker / Who\'s so good at his act / He even fakes the pain / Of pain he feels in fact.","- \u0625\u0646\u062a \u0642\u0627\u0633\u064a\u0629 .. \u0642\u0627\u0633\u064a\u0647 .. \u0642\u0627\u0633\u064a\u0629 .. \u0644\u0627 \u064a\u0646\u0642\u0635\u0643 \u063a\u064a\u0631 \u0627\u0644\u0633\u0648\u0637 .","\u0646\u0639\u0630\u0628 \u0625\u062e\u0648\u062a\u0646\u0627 \u0627\u0644\u0628\u0634\u0631 \u0628\u0628\u063a\u0636\u0646\u0627\u060c \u0628\u062d\u0642\u062f\u0646\u0627\u060c \u0628\u062e\u0628\u062b\u0646\u0627\u060c \u0644\u0646\u0642\u0648\u0644 \u0628\u0639\u062f \u0630\u0644\u0643: \u0627\u0644\u0639\u0627\u0644\u0645 \u0633\u064a\u0626..","Every spoken word double-crosses us.

Our fathers still had the believing impulse, which they transferred from Christianity to other forms of illusion. Some were champions of social equality, others were wholly enamoured of beauty, still others had faith in science and its achievements, and there were some who became even more Christian, resorting to various Easts and Wests in search of new religious forms to entertain their otherwise hollow consciousness of merely living.We lost all of this. We were born with none of these consolations. Each civilization follows the particular path of a religion that represents it; turning to other religions, it loses the one it had, and ultimately loses them all.We lost the one, and all the others with it.And so we were left, each man to himself, in the desolation of feeling ourselves live.

The only way to survive in this world is by keeping alive our dream, without ever fulfilling it, since the fulfilment never measures up to what we imagine \u2013 this was the closest thing to a message that Pessoa left, and he gave us Bernardo Soares to show us how it\u2019s done.","Nu suport ideea de a fi silit s\u0103 am un contact cu altcineva.O simpl\u0103 invita\u0163ie la pr\xe2nz din partea unui prieten \xeemi produce o nelini\u015fte greu de explicat.Ideea c\u0103 a\u015f avea o obliga\u0163ie social\u0103 oarecare,s\u0103 merg la o \xeenmorm\xe2ntare,s\u0103 tratez cu cineva o problem\u0103 ata\u015f\xe2ndu-m\u0103 de el,s\u0103 merg la gar\u0103 s\u0103 a\u015ftept o persoan\u0103 oarecare,cunoscut\u0103 sau necunoscut\u0103;o simpl\u0103 idee de acest fel \xeemi perturb\u0103 g\xe2ndurile o zi \xeentreag\u0103,iar uneori problema \xeencepe s\u0103 m\u0103 preocupe \xeenc\u0103 din seara precedent\u0103.","\u0643\u0644 \u0641\u064a\u0644\u0633\u0648\u0641 \u064a\u0639\u062a\u0642\u062f \u0623\u0646 \u0627\u0644\u0644\u0647 \u064a\u062a\u0641\u0642 \u0645\u0639\u0647","I\u2019ll disappear in the fog as a foreigner to all life, as a human island detached from the dream of the sea","Viajar?

CAT .  Morre jovem o que os Deuses amam, \xe9 um preceito da sabedoria antiga. E por certo a imagina\xe7\xe3o, que figura novos mundos, e a arte, que em obras os finge, s\xe3o os sinais not\xe1veis desse amor divino. N\xe3o concedem os Deuses esses dons para que sejamos felizes, sen\xe3o para que sejamos seus pares. Quem ama, ama s\xf3 a igual, porque o faz igual com am\xe1-lo. Como por\xe9m o homem n\xe3o pode ser igual dos Deuses, pois o Destino os separou, n\xe3o corre homem nem se alteia deus pelo amor divino; estagna s\xf3 deus fingido, doente da sua fic\xe7\xe3o.  N\xe3o morrem jovens todos a que os Deuses amam, sen\xe3o entendendo-se por morte o acabamento do que constitui a vida. E como \xe0 vida, al\xe9m da mesma vida, a constitui o instinto natural com que se a vive, os Deuses, aos que amam, matam jovens ou na vida, ou no instinto natural com que viv\xea-la. Uns morrem; aos outros, tirado o instinto com que vivam, pesa a vida como morte, vivem morte, morrem a vida em ela mesma. E \xe9 na juventude, quando neles desabrocha a flor fatal e \xfanica, que come\xe7am a sua morte vivida.  No her\xf3i, no santo e no g\xe9nio os Deuses se lembram dos homens. O her\xf3i \xe9 um homem como todos, a quem coube por sorte o aux\xedlio divino; n\xe3o est\xe1 nele a luz que lhe estreia a fronte, sol da gl\xf3ria ou luar da morte, e lhe separa o rosto dos de seus pares. O santo \xe9 um homem bom a que os Deuses, por miseric\xf3rdia, cegaram, para que n\xe3o sofresse; cego, pode crer no bem, em si, e em deuses melhores, pois n\xe3o v\xea, na alma que cuida pr\xf3pria e nas coisas incertas que o cercam, a opera\xe7\xe3o irremedi\xe1vel do capricho dos Deuses, o jugo superior do Destino. Os Deuses s\xe3o amigos do her\xf3i, compadecem-se do santo; s\xf3 ao g\xe9nio, por\xe9m, \xe9 que verdadeiramente amam. Mas o amor dos Deuses, como por destino n\xe3o \xe9 humano, revela-se em aquilo em que humanamente se n\xe3o revelara amor. Se s\xf3 ao g\xe9nio, amando-o, tornam seu igual, s\xf3 ao g\xe9nio d\xe3o, sem que queiram, a maldi\xe7\xe3o fatal do abra\xe7o de fogo com que tal o afagam. Se a quem deram a beleza, s\xf3 seu atributo, castigam com a consci\xeancia da mortalidade dela; se a quem deram a ci\xeancia, seu atributo tamb\xe9m, punem com o conhecimento do que nela h\xe1 de eterna limita\xe7\xe3o; que ang\xfastias n\xe3o far\xe3o pesar sobre aqueles, g\xe9nios do pensamento ou da arte, a quem, tornando-os criadores, deram a sua mesma ess\xeancia? Assim ao g\xe9nio caber\xe1, al\xe9m da dor da morte da beleza alheia, e da m\xe1goa de conhecer a universal ignor\xe2ncia, o sofrimento pr\xf3prio, de se sentir par dos Deuses sendo homem, par dos homens sendo deus, \xeaxul ao mesmo tempo em duas terras.  G\xe9nio na arte, n\xe3o teve S\xe1-Carneiro nem alegria nem felicidade nesta vida. S\xf3 a arte, que fez ou que sentiu, por instantes o turbou de consola\xe7\xe3o. S\xe3o assim os que os Deuses fadaram seus. Nem o amor os quer, nem a esperan\xe7a os busca, nem a gl\xf3ria os acolhe. Ou morrem jovens, ou a si mesmos sobrevivem, \xedncolas da incompreens\xe3o ou da indiferen\xe7a. Este morreu jovem, porque os Deuses lhe tiveram muito amor.  Mas para S\xe1-Carneiro, g\xe9nio n\xe3o s\xf3 da arte mas da inova\xe7\xe3o nela, juntou-se, \xe0 indiferen\xe7a que circunda os g\xe9nios, o esc\xe1rnio que persegue os inovadores, profetas, como Cassandra, de verdades que todos t\xeam por mentira. In qua scribebat, barbara terrafuit. Mas, se a terra fora outra, n\xe3o variara o destino. Hoje, mais que em outro tempo, qualquer privil\xe9gio \xe9 um castigo. Hoje, mais que nunca, se sofre a pr\xf3pria grandeza. As plebes de todas as classes cobrem, como uma mar\xe9 morta, as ru\xednas do que foi grande e os alicerces desertos do que poderia s\xea-lo. O circo, mais que em Roma que morria, \xe9 hoje a vida de todos; por\xe9m alargou os seus muros at\xe9 os confins da terra. A gl\xf3ria \xe9 dos gladiadores e dos mimos. Decide supremo qualquer soldado b\xe1rbaro, que a guarda imp\xf4s imperador. Nada nasce de grande que n\xe3o nas\xe7a maldito, nem cresce de nobre que se n\xe3o definhe, crescendo. Se assim \xe9, assim seja! Os Deuses o quiseram assim.  Fernando Pessoa, 1924.","Life, said Tarde, is the search for the impossible by way of the useless. Let us always search for the impossible, since that is our destiny, and let us search for it by way of the useless, since no path goes by any other way, but let us rise to the consciousness that nothing we search for can be found, and that nothing along the way deserves a fond kiss or memory. We weary of everything, said the scholiast, except understanding. Let us understand, let us keep understanding, and let us make ghostly flowers out of this understanding, shrewdly entwining them into wreaths and garlands which are also doomed to wilt.","To attain the satisfactions of the mystic state without having to endure its rigours; to be the ecstatic follower of no god, the mystic or epopt* with no initiation; to pass the days meditating on a paradise you don\u2019t believe in \u2013 all of this tastes good to the soul that knows what it means to know nothing.","Our Lady of the Hours that Pass, Madonna of stagnant waters and dead algae, Tutelary Goddess of vast deserts and dark landscapes of barren rocks, free me from my youth.","Nella vita odierna il mondo appartiene agli stolti, agli indifferenti e agli attivisti.

Everyone has always treated me kindly. Even the most casual acquaintance has found it difficult to be rude or brusque or even cool to me. Sometimes with a little help from me, that kindness could - or at least might - have developed into love or affection. I\'ve had neither the patience nor the concentration of mind to want to make the effort.When I first noticed this in myself - so little do we know ourselves - I attributed it to some shyness of the soul. But then I realised that this wasn\'t the case, it was an emotional tedium, different from the tedium of life; an impatience with the idea of associating myself with one continuous feeling, especially if that meant steeling myself to make some sustained effort. Why bother thought the unthinking part of me. I have enough subtlety, enough psychological sensitivity to know how, but the why has always escaped me. My weakness of will always began by being a weakness of the will even to have a will. The same happened with my emotions, my intelligence, my will itself, with everything in my life.But on the one occasion that malicious fate caused me to believe I loved someone and to recognise that I really was loved in return , it left me at first stunned and confused as if my number had come up on the lottery and I had won a huge amount of money in some inconvertible currency. Then, because I\'m only human, I felt rather flattered. However, that most natural of emotions soon passed, to be overtaken by a feeling difficult to define but one in which tedium, humiliation and weariness predominated.A feeling of tedium as if fate had imposed on me a task to be carried out during some unfamiliar evening shift. As if a new duty - that of an awful reciprocity - were given to me, ironically, as a privilege over which I would have to toil, all the time thanking fate for it. As if the flaccid monotony of life were not enough to bear without superimposing on it the obligatory monotony of a definite feeling.","Understanding is what wearies us most of all. To live is to not think.","Whether we like it or not, we are slaves to the hour in all its forms and colours, we are the subjects of heaven and earth. The part of us that despises its surroundings and plunges deepest into the forests within us does not take the same paths when it rains as when the sky is clear. Simply because it\u2019s raining or has stopped raining, obscure transmutations take place, felt only perhaps in the very heart of our most abstract feelings; we feel these transmutations without knowing it because we feel the weather even when we are unaware that we do.","\xbfQu\xe9 hombre ha puesto sobre tus senos una mano que fuera la m\xeda? \xbfQu\xe9 beso te han dado que fuera como el m\xedo?

This is what we all truly long to be, and the most plebeian among us perhaps more ardently than those full of false gold.

Books are the entryway to dreams, but people at ease in life don\'t need such introductions to enter into conversation with dreams.

At other timesour emotion is so strong that, although reduced to action, this actiondoesn\u2019t completely satisfy it; the leftover emotion, unexpressed in life, isused to produce the work of art. There are thus two types of artist: theone who expresses what he doesn\u2019t have, and the one who expresses thesurplus of what he did have.","Nosotros heredamos la destrucci\xf3n y sus resultados.","Some say there\u2019s no life without hope, others that hope makes life meaningless.","Everything seems doomed in advance to insignificance.","I should explain that I really did travel, but everything smacks to me of merely telling myself that I travelled, although I didn\u2019t.

I love all this, perhaps also because nothing is worth a human soul\'s love, and so it\'s all the same -- should we feel the urge to give it -- whether the recipient be the diminutive form of my inkstand or the vast indifference of the stars.","Everything is interconnected. My readings of classical authors, who never speaks of sunsets, have made many sunsets intelligible to me, in all their colors. There is a relationship between syntactical competence, by which we distinguish the values of beings, sounds and shapes, and the capacity to perceive when the blue of the sky is actually green, and how much yellow is in the blue green of the sky. It comes down to the same thing - the capacity to distinguish and to discriminate. There is no enduring emotion without syntax. Immortality depends of the grammarians.","Tudo que nos cerca se torna parte de n\xf3s, se nos infiltra na sensa\xe7\xe3o da carne e da vida, e, baba da grande Aranha, nos liga subtilmente ao que est\xe1 perto, enleando-nos num leito leve de morte lenta, onde baloi\xe7amos ao vento.

Read line by line, no poem, however great, has no single line that could not be improved upon, no episode that could not be more intense, and the whole is never so perfect that it could not be even more perfect.Woe betide the artist who notices this, who one day thinks this.

We read sensuality and life in words they drop from their lips without the slightest intention of being profound.","It is between sensation and my awareness of it that all the great tragedies of my life occur.

You are free if you can withdraw from people, not having to seek them out for the sake of money, company, love, glory or curiosity, none of which can thrive in silence and solitude.

By virtue of his gaze, he has all hills, and by virtue of his position, all valleys. The sun that gilds the summits will gild them more for him than for someone at the top who must endure the bright light; and the palace perched high in the woods will be more beautiful for those who see it from the valley than for those who, imprisoned in its rooms, forget it.","El tiempo pasa, nada nos dice. Envejecemos. Sepamos, con malicia casi, sentirnos ir. De nada vale hacer un gesto. No se resiste al dios atroz dios que sus hijos siempre devora.","I\u2019ve come to the realization that I\u2019m always thinking and listening to two things at once.","There is no enduring emotion without syntax. Immortality depends on the grammarians.","I hide behind the door, so that Reality won\u2019t see me when it enters.","I\'ll be living quietly in a house somewhere in the suburbs, enjoying a peaceful existence not writing the book I\'m not writing now and, so as to continue not doing so, I will come up with different excuses from the ones I use now to avoid actually confronting myself. Or else I\'ll be interned in a poorhouse, content with my utter failure, mingling with the riffraff who believed they were geniuses when in fact they were just beggars with dreams, mixing with the anonymous mass of people who had neither the strength to triumph nor the power to turn their defeats into victories.","Death means being subject to some external reality, and we, in each and every moment of our lives, are both a reflection and an effect of what surrounds us.Death underlies every living gesture. We are born dead, we live dead, and we enter death already dead.Composed of living cells and in a state of permanent dissolution, we are made of death.","In one of these tales, \u2018The Ascetic\u2019, the title character tells his interlocutor that paradises and nirvanas are \u2018illusions inside other illusions. If you dream you\u2019re dreaming, is the dream you dream less real than the dream you dream you\u2019re dreaming?\u2019 This sort of musing is vaguely reminiscent of Disquiet in its formative phase, which may be why Pessoa decided to entrust it to Guedes, whose wide-ranging literary talents made him a potentially excellent author-administrator of such a capacious work.","M\u0103 \xeencearc\u0103 un dezgust fizic fa\u0163\u0103 de umanitatea vulgar\u0103;de altfel,e singura care exist\u0103.Iar uneori \xeemi \xeeng\u0103dui capriciul de a aprofunda acest dezgust,a\u015fa cum \xee\u0163i po\u0163i provoca voma ca s\u0103 te u\u015furezi de senza\u0163ia de vom\u0103.","The sincerity of intellectual affirmation has nothing to do with the naturalness of spontaneous emotion.","Every gesture, however simple, violates an inner secret. Every gesture is a revolutionary act; an exile, perhaps, from the true ... of our intentions. Action is a disease of thought, a cancer of imagination. Action is self-exile. Every action is incomplete and flawed.","Drunk on errors, for a few moments I stray away from feeling myself live.","I am the size of what I seeAnd not the size of my stature.","Ele dorme dentro da minha alma E \xe0s vezes acorda de noite E brinca com os meus sonhos.

Happy are those who can make of their suffering something universal. I don\u2019t know if the world is sad or bad, nor do I care, because I feel bored and indifferent in the face of other people\u2019s suffering. Aslong as they don\u2019t cry or moan \u2014 which I find irritating and embarrassing \u2014I greet their suffering with a shrug of the shoulders, so deep is my disdain for them.","Todo o homem de hoje, em quem a estatura moral e o relevo intelectualn\xe3o sejam de pigmeu ou de charro, ama, quando ama, com o amor rom\xe2ntico.O amor rom\xe2ntico \xe9 um produto extremo de s\xe9culos sobre s\xe9culos deinflu\xeancia crist\xe3","Brief dark shadow of a downtown tree, light sound of water falling into the sad pool, green of the trimmed lawn \u2013 public garden shortly before twilight: you are in this moment the whole universe for me, for you are the entire contents of my conscious sensation.

Notto do good, because I don\u2019t know what good is, nor even if I do it when Ithink I do. How do I know what evils I generate if I give a beggarmoney? How do I know what evils I produce if I teach or instruct? Notknowing, I refrain. And besides, I think that to help or clarify is, in acertain way, to commit the evil of interfering in the lives of others.Kindness depends on a whim of our mood, and we have no right to makeothers the victims of our whims, however humane or kind-hearted theymay be.

But I think I\u2019m more sensitive than the vast majority. I\u2019m a sensitive man who knows himself, and who therefore knows sensitivity.Ah, it\u2019s not true that life is painful, or that it\u2019s painful to think about life. What\u2019s true is that our pain is grave and serious only when we pretend it is. If we let it be, it will leave just as it came, it will die down the way it grew up.

A ship may seem to be an object whose purpose is to sail, but no, its purpose is to reach a port. We found ourselves sailing without any idea of what port we were supposed to reach.

From somuch self-revising, I\u2019ve destroyed myself. From so much self-thinking,I\u2019m now my thoughts and not I.

To want not to suffer from this is to want too much, for it\u2019s beyond human capacity to accept what\u2019s obviously bad as if it were something good; and if we accept it as the bad thing it is, then we can\u2019t help but suffer.","All that we truly possess are our own sensations; it is in them, rather than in what they sense, that we must base our life\u2019s reality.","better to supremely not act than to act spottily, inadequately andin vain, like the superfluous, inane, vast majority of men.","Vorrei parlarti, averti sempre accanto, e che non fosse necessario scriverti lettere - le lettere sono segni di separazione - o almeno segni, per la necessit\xe0 di scriverle, del fatto di essere lontani.","[13] Incluso pensar as\xed es actuar.

For example, it divides verbs into transitive and intransitive. But a man who knows how to say what he says must sometimes make a transitive verb intransitive so as to photograph what he feels instead of seeing it in the dark, like the common lot of human animals. If I want to say I exist, I\u2019ll say, \u2018I am.\u2019 If I want to say I exist as a separate entity, I\u2019ll say, \u2018I am myself.\u2019 But if I want to say I exist as an entity that addresses and acts on itself, exercising the divine function of self-creation, then I\u2019ll make to be into a transitive verb. Triumphantly and anti-grammatically supreme, I\u2019ll speak of \u2018amming myself\u2019. I\u2019ll have stated a philosophy in just two words. Isn\u2019t this infinitely preferable to saying nothing in forty sentences? What more can we demand from philosophy and diction?Let grammar rule the man who doesn\u2019t know how to think what he feels. Let it serve those who are in command when they express themselves. It is told of Sigismund, King of Rome,* that when someone pointed out a grammatical mistake he had made in a speech, he answered, \u2018I am King of Rome, and above all grammar.\u2019 And he went down in history as Sigismund super-grammaticam.

The monster immanent in things, for the sake of his own good or his own evil, which are apparently indifferent to him, is equally served by the shifting of a rock on a hilltop or by the stirring of envy or greed in a heart.

After all, the homme fatal exists in the dreams of all ordinary men, and romanticism is merely the turning inside out of our normal daily selves. In the most secret part of their being, all men dream of ruling over a great empire, with all men their subjects, all women theirs for the asking, adored by all the people and (if they are inferior men) of all ages \u2026 Few are as accustomed to dreaming as I am and so are not lucid enough to laugh at the aesthetic possibility of nurturing such dreams. The most serious criticism of romanticism has not yet been made, namely, that it represents the inner truth of human nature, an externalization of what lies deepest in the human soul, but made concrete, visible, even possible, if being possible depends on something other than Fate, and its excesses, its absurdities, its various ploys for moving and seducing people, all stem from that.Even I who laugh at the seductive traps laid by the imagination often find myself imagining how wonderful it would be to be famous, how gratifying to be loved, how thrilling to be a success! And yet I can never manage to see myself in those exulted roles without hearing a guffaw from the other \u201cI I always keep as close to me as a street in the Baixa. Do I imagine myself famous? Only as a famous bookkeeper. Do I fancy myself raised up onto the thrones of celebrity? This fantasy only ever comes upon me in the office in Rua dos Douradores, and my colleagues inevitably ruin the effect. Do I hear the applause of the most variegated multitudes? That applause comes from the cheap fourth-floor room where I live and clashes horribly with the shabby furnishings, with the surrounding vulgarity, humiliating both me and the dream. I never even had any castles in Spain, like those Spaniards we Portuguese have always feared. My castles were built out of an incomplete deck of grubby playing cards; and they didn\u2019t collapse of their own accord, but had to be demolished with a sweeping gesture of the hand, the impatient gesture of an elderly maid wanting to restore the tablecloth and reset the table, because teatime was calling like some fateful curse. Even that vision is of little worth, because I don\u2019t have a house in the provinces or old aunts at whose table, at the end of a family gathering, I sit sipping a cup of tea that tastes to me of repose. My dream failed even in its metaphors and figurations. My empire didn\u2019t even go as far as a pack of old playing cards. My victory didn\u2019t even include a teapot or an ancient cat.

The destructive work of previous generations left us a world that offered no security in the religious sphere, no guidance in the moral sphere, and no peace in the political sphere. We were born into the midst of metaphysical anguish, moral anxiety and political disquietude. Inebriated with objective formulas, with the mere methods of reason and science, the generations that preceded us did away with the foundations of the Christian faith, since their biblical criticism \u2013 progressing from textual to mythological criticism \u2013 reduced the gospels and the earlier scriptures of the Jews to a doubtful heap of myths, legends and mere literature, while their scientific criticism gradually revealed the mistakes and ingenuous notions of the gospels\u2019 primitive \u2018science\u2019. At the same time, the spirit of free inquiry brought all metaphysical problems out into the open, and with them all the religious problems that had to do with metaphysics. Drunk with a hazy notion they called \u2018positivism\u2019, these generations criticized all morality and scrutinized all rules of life, and all that remained from the clash of doctrines was the certainty of none of them and the grief over there being no certainty. A society so undisciplined in its cultural foundations could obviously not help but be a victim, politically, of its own chaos, and so we woke up to a world eager for social innovations, a world that gleefully pursued a freedom it didn\u2019t grasp and a progress it had never defined.","Only when night comes do I feel, if not happiness, at least some kind of repose which I experience as contentment","\xcen\u0163eleg c\u0103 cineva incapabil s\u0103 simt\u0103 trebuie s\u0103 c\u0103l\u0103toreasc\u0103.Iat\u0103 de ce sunt at\xe2t de s\u0103rac atunci c\xe2nd aleg drept c\u0103r\u0163i de experien\u0163\u0103 c\u0103r\u0163ile de c\u0103l\u0103torii,care au o valoare doar prin imagina\u0163ia celor care scriu.Iar dac\u0103 cel care scrie are o imagina\u0163ie bogat\u0103,ne poate \xeenc\xe2nta la fel de bine \u015fi cu descrierea minu\u0163ioas\u0103,fotografic\u0103 a peisajelor pe care \u015fi le-a imaginat,\u015fi cu descrierea,fire\u015fte c\u0103 mult mai vag\u0103,a peisajelor pe care se presupune c\u0103 le-a v\u0103zut.Suntem cu to\u0163ii ni\u015fte miopi,dar nu \u015fi pe din\u0103untru.Numai visul vede cu privirea.","The absurd lie has all the charm of the perverse with the even greater, ultimate charm of being innocent.","amar \xe9 cansar-se de estar s\xf3: uma cobardia.","With the beginning of summer I grow sad. One would think that the brilliance of summer hours, however harsh, would seem sweet to someone ignorant of his own identity. But that\'s not the case with me. There is too sharp a contrast between all that exuberant outer life and what I feel and think, without knowing how to feel or think - the perennially unburied corpse of my feelings. I have the impression that, in this formless homeland called the universe, I live beneath a political tyranny which, although it does not oppress me directly, still offends some hidden principle in my soul. And then slowly, secretly, there grows within me the anticipated nostalgia of an impossible exile.","Porque no vay\xe1is a creer que escribo para publicar, ni para escribir, ni siquiera por hacer arte.

To go further would be to enter the realm of jealousy, suffering and anxiety. In this antechamber of emotion there\'s all the sweetness of love - hints of pleasure, whiffs of passion - without any of its depth. If this means giving up the grandeur of tragic love, we must remember that tragedies, for the aesthete, are interesting to observe but unpleasant to experience. The cultivation of life hinders that of the imagination. It is the aloof, uncommon man who rules. No doubt this theory would satisfy me, if I could convince myself that it\'s not what it is: a complicated jabber to fill the ears of my intelligence, to make it almost forget that at heart I\'m just timid, with no aptidude for life.","I\u2019ve witnessed, incognito, the gradual collapse of my life, the slow foundering of all that I wanted to be.","How is it that I have advanced only to become what I already was?

I\u2019m like those who prize the medal more than the struggle to get it, and savour glory in a fur-lined cape. For me, to write is self-deprecating, and yet I can\u2019t quit doing it. Writing is like the drug I abhor and keep taking, the addiction I despise and depend on. There are necessary poisons, and some are extremely subtle, composed of ingredients from the soul, herbs collected from among the ruins of dreams, black poppies found next to the graves of our intentions, the long leaves of obscene trees whose branches sway on the echoing banks of the soul\u2019s infernal rivers. To write is to lose myself, yes, but everyone loses himself, because everything gets lost. I, however, lose myself without any joy \u2013 not like the river flowing into the sea for which it was secretly born, but like the puddle left on the beach by the high tide, and its water sinks into the sand, never returning to the sea.","But while the sloppy criticism of our fathers bequeathed to us the impossibility of being Christians, it didn\u2019t bequeath to us an acceptance of the impossibility; while it bequeathed to us a disbelief in established moral codes, it didn\u2019t bequeath to us an indifference to morality and the rules for peaceful human coexistence; while it left the thorny problem of politics in doubt, it didn\u2019t leave our minds unconcerned about how to solve it. Our fathers blithely wreaked destruction, for they lived in a time that was still informed by the solidity of the past. The very thing they destroyed was what gave strength to society and enabled them to destroy without noticing that the building was cracking. We inherited the destruction and its aftermath. Today the world belongs only to the stupid, the insensitive and the agitated. Today the right to live and triumph is awarded on virtually the same basis as admission into an insane asylum: an inability to think, amorality, and nervous excitability.","I dream because I dream, but I don\u2019t insult myself by giving to dreams a value they do not have, apart from that of being my personal theatre, just as I do not call wine (from which I still do not abstain) \u2018food\u2019 or \u2018one of life\u2019s necessities\u2019.","Every day I\u2019m mistreated by Matter.","We know nothing.

Para m\xed, s\xf3lo mi autoconsciencia es real; los dem\xe1s son fen\xf3menos inciertos en esa conciencia, y ser\xeda enfermizo prestarles una realidad muy verdadera.","I feel this because I feel nothing. I think this because this is nothing. Nothing, nothing, part of the night and the silence and what I share with them of vacancy, of negativity, of in-betweenness, a gap between me and myself, something forgotten by some god or other \u2026 442","To imagine, without being, is the throne. To desire, without wanting, is the crown. We have what we renounce, for we conserve it eternally intact in our dreams, by the light of the sun that isn\'t, or of the moon that cannot be.","We may be guided by an illusion, but one thing is sure, it is not our consciousness that guides us.","Siempre he pertenecido a lo que no est\xe1 donde estoy y a lo que no he podido ser nunca.","I see humanity as merely one of Nature\u2019s latest schools of decorativepainting. I don\u2019t distinguish in any fundamental way between a man anda tree, and I naturally prefer whichever is more decorative, whicheverinterests my thinking eyes.","Never to feel his own feelings sincerely, and to rise his pallid triumph to the point of regarding his own ambitions, longings and desires with indifference; to pass alongside his joys anxieties as if passing by someone who doesn\'t interest him \u2026The greatest self-mastery is to be indifferent towards ourselves, to see our body and soul as merely the house and grounds where Destiny willed that we spend our life. To treat our own dreams and deepest desires with arrogance, en grand seigneur, politely and carefully ignoring them. To act modestly in our own presence; to realize that we are never truly alone, since we are our own witnesses, and should therefore act before ourselves as before a stranger, with a studied and serene outward manner \u2013 indifferent because it\'s noble, and cold because it\'s indifferent.In order not to sink in our own estimation, all we have to do is quit having ambitions, passions, desires, hopes, whims or nervous disquiet. The key is to remember that we\'re always in our presence \u2013 we are never so alone that we can feel at ease. With this in mind, we will overcome having passions and ambitions, for this make us vulnerable; we won\'t have desires or hopes, since desires and hopes are plebeian and inelegant; and we won\'t have whims or be disquieted, because rash behavior is unpleasant for others to witness, and agitated behaviors is always a vulgarity.The aristocrat is the one who never forgets that he\'s never alone, that\'s why etiquette and decorum are the privilege of aristocrats. Let take him out of his gardens and drawing rooms and place him in our soul and in our consciousness of existing. Let\'s always treat ourselves with etiquette and decorum, with studied and for-other-people gestures.Each of us is an entire community, an entire neighborhood of the great Mystery, and we should at least make sure that the life of our neighborhood is distinctive and elegant, that the feasts of our sensations are genteel and restrained, and that the banquets of our thoughts are decorous and dignified. Since other souls may build poor and filthy neighborhoods around us, we should clearly define where our begins and ends, and from the facades of our feelings to the alcoves of our shyness, everything should be noble and serene, sculpted in sobriety, without ostentation.We should try to find a serene way to realize each sensation. To reduce love to the shadow of a dream of love, a pale and tremulous interval between the crests of two tint, moonlit waves. To turn desire into a useless and innocuous thing, a kind of knowing smile in our soul; to make it into something we never dream of achieving or even expressing. To lull hearted to sleep like a captive snake, and to tell fear to give up all its outer manifestations except for anguish in our eyes, or rather, in our eyes of soul, for only this attitude can be considered aesthetic.","What used to be moral is aesthetic for us. What was social is nowindividual.","The outside world exists like an actor on a stage: it\'s there but it\'s pretending to be something else.","Love is a mysticism that wants to be put into practice, an impossibility that according to our dreams should be possible.","My inability to act has always been an ailment with a metaphysical aetiology. I\u2019ve always felt that to perform a gesture implied a disturbance, a repercussion, in the outer universe; I\u2019ve always had the impression that any movement I might make would unsettle the stars and rock the skies. And so the tiniest gesture assumed for me early on a metaphysical significance of astonishing proportions. I developed an attitude of transcendental honesty with respect to all action, and ever since this attitude took firm hold in my consciousness, it has prevented me from having intense relations with the tangible world.","No el amor, sino los alrededores es lo que vale la pena...  La represi\xf3n del amor ilumina sus fen\xf3menos con mucha m\xe1s claridad que la misma experiencia.","I asked for very little from life, and even this little was denied me. A nearby field, a ray of sunlight, a little bit of calm along with a bit of bread, not to feel oppressed by the knowledge that I exist, not to demand anything from others, and not to have others demand anything from me\u2014this was denied me, like the spare change we might deny a beggar not because we\u2019re mean-hearted but because we don\u2019t feel like unbuttoning our coat.","Tudo quanto de desagrad\xe1vel nos sucede na vida \u2014 figuras rid\xedculas quefazemos, maus gestos que temos, lapsos em que ca\xedmos de qualquer dasvirtudes \u2014 deve ser considerado como meros acidentes externos, impotentespara atingir a subst\xe2ncia da alma.

What you heard was a lie, And the lie is in you.","Life would be intolerable if we were conscious of it. Happily, we are not. We live with the same unconsciousness as animals, in the same futile vain way, and if we think in advance about death (which they, in all probability, without being dogmatic do not do), we think about it through the veils of so many oblivions, so many distractions and meanderings, that it can hardly be said we think about it at all.","\xa1Pobres semidioses novatos que conquistan imperios con la palabra y con la intenci\xf3n noble, pero necesitan dinero para pagar el cuarto y la comida!","Sleep is fusion with God, Nirvana, however it be called.","Literature, which is art married to thought and the immaculate realization of reality, seems to me the goal towards which all human effort should be directed, as long as that effort is truly human and not just a vestige of the animal in us.","Now, as many times before, I am troubled by my own experience of my feelings, by my anguish simply to be feeling something, my disquiet at simply being here, my nostalgia for something never known, the setting of the sun on all emotions, this fading, in my external consciousness of myself, from yellow into gray sadness.Who will save me from existence? It isn\u2019t death I want, or life: it\u2019s the other thing that shines at the bottom of all longing like a possible diamond in a cave one cannot reach. It\u2019s the whole weight and pain of this real and impossible universe, of this sky, of this standard borne by some unknown army, of these colors that grow pale in the fictitious air, out of which there emerges in still, electric whiteness the imaginary crescent of the moon, silhouetted by distance and indifference.The absence of a true God has become the empty corpse of the vast sky and the closed soul. Infinite prison, because you are infinite no one can escape you!","The beauty of a naked body is only appreciated by cultures that use clothing. Modesty is important for sensuality like resistance for energy. Artificiality is the best way to enjoy what\'s natural. Whatever I\'ve enjoyed in these vast fields I\'ve enjoyed because I don\'t live here. One who has never lived under constraints doesn\'t know what freedom is. Civilization is an education in nature. Artificiality is the path for appreciating what\'s natural. We should never, however, take the artificial for the natural.It\'s the harmony between the natural and the artificial that constitutes the natural state of the superior human soul.","In the plausible intimacy of approaching evening, as I stand waiting for the stars to begin at the window of this fourth floor room that looks out on the infinite, my dreams move to the rhythm required by long journeys to countries as yet unknown, or to countries that are simply hypothetical or impossible.","Ever since I was a child, the intrinsic futility of all forms of action has been a cherished touchstone for my detachment from everything, including me.","To be published = the socialization of the self. What a base necessity!","To move is to live, to express oneself is to endure.","Note that the art of dreaming is not the art of directing our dreams. To direct is to act.

This young lad collected brochures on different cities, countries and travel companies; he had maps, some torn out of newspapers, others begged from one place or another; he cut out pictures of landscapes, engravings of exotic costumes, paintings of boats and ships from various journals and magazines. He would visit travel agencies on behalf of some real or hypothetical company, possibly the actual one in which he worked, and ask for brochures on Italy or India, brochures giving details of sailings between Portugal and Australia. He was not only the greatest traveler I\'ve ever known (because he was truest), he was also one of the happiest people I have had the good fortune to meet. I\'m sorry not to know what has become of him, though, to be honest, I\'m not really sorry, I only feel that I should be. I\'m not really sorry because today, ten or more years on from that brief period in which i knew him, he must be a grown man, stolidly, reliably fulfilling his duties, married perhaps, someone\'s breadwinner - in other words, one of the living dead. By now he may even have traveled in his body, he who knew so well how to travel in his soul. A sudden memory assails me: he knew exactly which trains one had to catch to ho from Paris to Bucharest; which trains one took to cross England; and in his garbled pronunciation of the strange names hung the bright certainty of the greatness of his soul. Now he probably lives like a dead man, but perhaps one day, when he\'s old, he\'ll remember that to dream of Bordeaux is not only better, but truer, than actually to arrive in Bordeaux","Only unhappiness raises us up \u2014 and the tedium we draw from that unhappiness is as heraldic as being the descendant of distant heroes.","I know of no pleasure like that of books, yet I read very little. Books are the entryway to dreams, but people at ease in life don\u2019t need such introductions to enter into conversation with dreams. I could never read a book and give myself over to it; always, with each step, the commentary of my intellect or my imagination interrupts the narrative sequence.

In non-sexual love, we seek our own pleasure via our own idea. The masturbator may be abject, but in point of fact he\u2019s the perfect logical expression of the lover.

It stands out from those things whose fate it shares by virtue of a privilege that is also destined for the dustpan. The gods continue their conversations above the sweeping, indifferent to these incidents in the world below.","Action disconcerts us, partly because of our physical incompetence, but mainly because it offends our moral sensibility.

I saw that I was dressed as a page, but they didn\u2019t give me a queen, and blamed me for not having her. I saw that I had a message in my hand to deliver, and when I told them that the sheet of paper was blank, they laughed at me. And I still don\u2019t know if they laughed because all sheets are blank, or because all messages are to be guessed. Finally I sat down on the rock at the crossroads as before the fireplace I never had. And I began, all by myself, to make paper boats with the lie they\u2019d given me.

The sound of the waves at night is a sound of the night, and how many have heard it in their own soul, like the perpetual hope that dissolves in the darkness with a faint plash of distant foam! What tears were shed by those who achieved, what tears lost by those who succeeded! And all of this, in my walk to the seashore, was a secret told me by the night and the abyss. How many we are! How many of us fool ourselves! What seas crash in us, in the night when we exist, along the beaches that we feel ourselves to be, inundated by emotion! All that was lost, all that should have been sought, all that was obtained and fulfilled by mistake, all that we loved and lost and then, after losing it and loving it for having lost it, realized we never loved; all that we believed we were thinking when we were feeling; all the memories we took for emotions; and the entire ocean, noisy and cool, rolling in from the depths of the vast night to ripple over the beach, during my nocturnal walk to the seashore \u2026","Quando eu abandonar o meu ser como uma cadeira donde me levanto Deixar atr\xe1s o mundo como a um quarto donde saio, Abandonar toda esta forma, de sentidos e pensamento, de sentir as coisas, Como uma capa que me prenda, Quando de vez minha alma chegar \xe0 superf\xedcie da minha pele E dispersar o meu ser pelo universo exterior, Seja com alegria que eu reconhe\xe7a que a Morte Vem como um sol distante na antemanh\xe3 do meu novo ser.","Every effort is a crime, because every gesture is a dead dream.","If only the day and happiness would never come!

Love is the most carnal of illusions. Listen: to love is to possess. And what does a lover possess? The body? To possess it we would have to incorporate it, to eat it, to make its substance our own. And this impossibility, were it possible, wouldn\u2019t last, because our own body passes on and transforms, because we don\u2019t even possess our body (just our sensation of it), and because once the beloved body were possessed it would become ours and stop being other, and so love, with the disappearance of the other, would likewise disappear.Do we possess the soul? Listen carefully: no, we don\u2019t. Not even our own soul is ours. And how could a soul ever be possessed? Between one and another soul lies the impassable chasm of the fact that they\u2019re two souls.What do we possess? What do we possess? What makes us love? Beauty? And do we possess it when we love? If we vehemently, totally possess a body, what do we really possess? Not the body, not the soul, and not even beauty. When we grasp an attractive body, it\u2019s not beauty but fatty and cellular flesh that we embrace; our kiss doesn\u2019t touch the mouth\u2019s beauty but the wet flesh of decaying, membranous lips; and even sexual intercourse, though admittedly a close and ardent contact, is not a true penetration, not even of one body into another. What do we possess? What do we really possess?Our own sensations, at least? Isn\u2019t love at least a means of possessing ourselves through our sensations? Isn\u2019t it at least a way of dreaming vividly, and therefore more gloriously, the dream that we exist? And once the sensation has vanished, doesn\u2019t the memory at least stay with us always, so that we really possess\u2026Let\u2019s cast off even this delusion. We don\u2019t even possess our own sensations. Don\u2019t speak. Memory is no more than our sensation of the past.

Ver o Tempo pintar o mundo e achar o quadro n\xe3o s\xf3 falso mas v\xe3o.Pensar em frases que se contradigam, falando alto em sons que n\xe3o s\xe3o sons e cores que n\xe3o s\xe3o cores. Dizer \u2014 e compreend\xea-lo, o que \xe9 ali\xe1s imposs\xedvel \u2014 que temos consci\xeancia de n\xe3o ter consci\xeancia, e que n\xe3o somos o que somos. Explicar isto tudo por um sentido oculto e paradoxo que as coisas tenham no seu aspecto outro-lado e divino, e n\xe3o acreditar demasiado na explica\xe7\xe3o para que n\xe3o hajamos de a abandonar.Esculpir em sil\xeancio nulo todos os nossos sonhos de falar. Estagnar em torpor todos os nossos pensamentos de a\xe7\xe3o.E sobre tudo isto, como um c\xe9u uno e azul, o horror de viver paira alheadamente.","Entre o Sono e SonhoEntre o sono e sonho, Entre mim e o que em mim \xc9 o quem eu me suponho Corre um rio sem fim.

Let\u2019s internalize the aristocrat. Let\u2019s take him out of his gardens and drawing rooms and place him in our soul and in our consciousness of existing. Let\u2019s always treat ourselves with etiquette and decorum, with studied and for-other-people gestures.Each of us is an entire community, an entire neighbourhood of the great Mystery,* and we should at least make sure that the life of our neighbourhood is distinctive and elegant, that the feasts of our sensations are genteel and restrained, and that the banquets of our thoughts are decorous and dignified.","The child is still there but has fallen silent. I see the way I saw, but from behind my eyes I see myself seeing, and that is enough to darken the sun, to make the green of the trees old, and to wilt the flowers before they open.","Do not make the infantile mistake of asking the meaning of things and words. Nothing has any meaning.","Nos encanta la perfecci\xf3n porque no podemos tenerla; si la tuvi\xe9ramos, nos repugnar\xeda.

Mi ha arrecato dolore e sollievo al medesimo tempo. Dolore, perch\xe9 queste cose sono sempre dolorose; sollievo, perch\xe9, in verit\xe0, questa \xe8 l\u2019unica soluzione - non prolunghiamo oltre una situazione che ormai non trova pi\xf9 la giustificazione dell\u2019amore, n\xe9 da una parte n\xe9 dall\u2019altra.Da parte mia, per lo meno, rimane una stima profonda, un\u2019amicizia inalterabile. Ofelinha non mi negher\xe0 altrettanto, vero?N\xe9 Ofelinha, n\xe9 io, abbiamo colpa in tutto questo. Solo il destino avrebbe colpa, se il destino fosse una persona a cui attribuire colpe.Il Tempo, che invecchia volti e capelli, invecchia anche, ma ancora pi\xf9 in fretta, gli affetti pi\xf9 coinvolgenti. La maggior parte delle persone, perch\xe9 \xe8 stupida, non se ne rende conto, e crede di continuare ad amare perch\xe9 ha l\u2019abitudine di sentire se stessa che ama.Se cos\xec non fosse, al mondo non ci sarebbero persone felici.Le creature superiori, tuttavia, sono prive della possibilit\xe0 di questa illusione, perch\xe9 non possono credere che l\u2019amore sia durevole, n\xe9, quando sentono che \xe8 finito, si ingannano interpretando come amore la stima, o la gratitudine, che esso ha lasciato.Queste cose fanno soffrire, ma la sofferenza passa.Se la vita, che \xe8 tutto, infine passa, perch\xe9 non dovrebbero passare l\u2019amore e il dolore, e tutte le altre cose, che non sono altro che parti della vita? Nella sua lettera \xe8 ingiusta con me, ma la capisco e la scuso; di sicuro l\u2019ha scritta con rabbia, forse persino con dolore, ma la maggior parte delle persone - uomini o donne - avrebbe scritto, nel suo caso, con un tono ancora pi\xf9 aspro, e in termini ancora pi\xf9 ingiusti.Ma Ofelinha possiede un ottimo carattere, e anche la sua irritazione non riesce ad essere cattiva. Quando si sposer\xe0, se non otterr\xe0 la felicit\xe0 che merita, certamente non sar\xe0 per colpa sua.Quanto a me... L\u2019amore \xe8 passato. Ma conservo per lei un affetto inalterabile, e non dimenticher\xf2 mai - mai, mi creda - n\xe9 la sua graziosa figurina e i suoi modi da ragazzina, n\xe9 la sua dolcezza, la sua dedizione, la sua adorabile indole.Pu\xf2 essere che m\u2019inganni, e che queste qualit\xe0, che le attribuisco, fossero una mia illusione; ma neppure credo che lo fossero, n\xe9, se lo sono state, sarebbe scortese da parte mia attribuirgliele.Non so cosa desidera che le restituisca - lettere o che altro. Io preferirei non restituirle nulla, e conservare le sue letterine come memoria viva di un passato morto, come ogni passato; come qualcosa di commovente in una vita, come la mia, in cui l\u2019avanzare degli anni va di pari passo con l\u2019avanzare dell\u2019infelicit\xe0 e della delusione.Non faccia come la gente comune, che \xe8 sempre grossolana; non volti il capo dall\u2019altra parte quando ci incontriamo, e non abbia di me un ricordo in cui entri il rancore. Rimaniamo, l\u2019uno con l\u2019altro, come due che si conoscono dall\u2019infanzia, che si amarono un poco quando erano bambini, e ora, nella vita adulta, seguono altri affetti, e altre strade, e conservano sempre, in un angolino dell\u2019anima, la memoria profonda del loro amore antico e inutile.Ma questi \u2018altri affetti\u2019 e \u2018altre strade\u2019 riguardano lei, Ofelinha, non me. Il mio Destino appartiene ad altra Legge, della cui esistenza Ofelinha \xe8 all\u2019oscuro, ed \xe8 subordinato ogni volta di pi\xf9 all\u2019obbedienza a Maestri che non permettono e che non perdonano. Non \xe8 necessario che comprenda questo. E sufficiente che mi conservi con affetto nel suo ricordo, cos\xec come io, inalterabilmente, la conserver\xf2 nel mio.Fernando","Never to feel one\u2019s feelings wholeheartedly and then to elevate that wan victory to the point of being able to regard one\u2019s own ambitions, longings and desires with indifference; to pass by one\u2019s joys and griefs as one would a person in whom one feels no interest.","And all that remains is me, a poor abandoned child, whom no Love wanted as an adopted son, and no Friendship chose as a playmate.","The great anguishes of the soul always come upon us like cosmic cataclysms. When they do, the sun errs from its course and the stars are troubled. A day will come to every feeling soul when Fate stages an apocalypse of anguish, an upturning of all known heavens and universes over the soul\'s desolation.","The world belongs to the unfeeling. The essential condition for being a practical man is the absence of any sensitivity","I\'m nothing. I\'ll always be nothing. I can\'t want to be something.

But if they weren\u2019t enough, What I would want is a sun more sun than the sun, Meadows more meadows than these meadows, Flowers more flowers than these flowers\u2014 Everything more ideal than what it is, in the same way and same manner! That thing over there more there than it is!","I saw dawn break and felt happy; today I see dawn break, feel happy, and become sad. The child is still there but has fallen silent. I see the way I saw, but from behind my eyes I see myself seeing, and that is enough to darken the sun, to make the green of the trees old, and to wilt the flowers before they open.","To pretend is to love. Whenever I see a pretty smile or a meaningful gaze, no matter whom the smile or gaze belongs to, I always plumb to the soul of the smiling or gazing face to discover what politician wants to buy our vote or what prostitute wants us to buy her. But the politician that buys us loved at least the act of buying us, even as the prostitute loved being bought by us. Like it or not, we cannot escape universal brotherhood. We all love each other, and the lie is the kiss we exchange.","From birth to death, man is the slave of the same external dimensionthat rules animals. Throughout his life he doesn\u2019t live, he vegetativelythrives, with greater intensity and complexity than an animal.","The ordinary man, however hard his life may be, at least has thepleasure of not thinking about it. To take life as it comes, living itexternally like a cat or a dog \u2013 that is how people in general live, andthat is how life should be lived, if we would have the contentment of thecat or dog.To think is to destroy. Thought itself is destroyed in the process ofthinking, because to think is to decompose. If men knew how tomeditate on the mystery of life, if they knew how to feel the thousandcomplexities which spy on the soul in every single detail of action, thenthey would never act \u2013 they wouldn\u2019t even live. They would killthemselves from fright, like those who commit suicide to avoid beingguillotined the next day.","Nunca houve romariaQue se lembrassem de mim...Tamb\xe9m quem se lembrariaDe quem se lamenta assim?","el af\xe1n de alcanzar algo es menor que lo que logramos alcanzar.","O amor \xe9 um sonho que chega para o pouco ser que se \xe9.","Everything, for us, is in our concept of the world.

Worse, however, is the work we never do. A work that\'s finished is at least finished. It may be poor, but it exists, like the miserable plant in the lone flowerpot of my neighbor who\'s crippled. That plant is her happiness, and sometimes it\'s even mine. What I write, bad as it is, may provide some hurt or sad soul a few moments of distraction from something worse.
