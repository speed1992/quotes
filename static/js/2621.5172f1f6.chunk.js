It is easier to protect your feet with slippers than to carpet the whole of the earth.","I was neurotic for years. I was anxious and depressed and selfish. Everyone kept telling me to change. I resented them and I agreed with them, and I wanted to change, but simply couldn\'t, no matter how hard I tried. Then one day someone said to me, Don\'t change. I love you just as you are. Those words were music to my ears: Don\'t change, Don\'t change. Don\'t change . . . I love you as you are. I relaxed. I came alive. And suddenly I changed!","If you look carefully you will see that there is one thing and only one thing that causes unhappiness. The name of that thing is attachment. What is an attachment? An emotional state of clinging caused by the belief that without some particular thing or some person you cannot be happy.","Live your life as you see fit. That\'s not selfish. Selfish is to demand that others live their lives as you see fit.","Wisdom tends to grow in proportion to one\'s awareness of one\'s ignorance.","\\"Why is everyone here so happy except me?\\" \\"Because they have learned to see goodness and beauty everywhere,\\" said the Master. \\"Why don\'t I see goodness and beauty everywhere?\\" \\"Because you cannot see outside of you what you fail to see inside.\\"","There is only one cause of unhappiness: the false beliefs you have in your head, beliefs so widespread, so commonly held, that it never occurs to you to question them.","We do not have a fear of the unknown. What we fear is giving up the known.","The day you are happy for no reason whatsoever, the day you find yourself taking delight in everything and in nothing, you will know that you have found the land of unending joy called the kingdom.","If you want to know what it means to be happy, look at a flower, a bird, a child; they are perfect images of the kingdom. For they live from moment to moment in the eternal now with no past and no future.","Life is easy, life is delightful. It\'s only hard on your illusions, your ambitions, your greed, your cravings.","You don\'t have to add anything in order to be happy; you\'ve got to drop something.","When you fight something, you\'re tied to it forever. As long as you\'re fighting it, you\u2019re giving it power.","As you identify less and less with the \u201cme\u201d, you will be more at ease with everybody and with everything. Do you know why? Because you are no longer afraid of being hurt or not liked. You no longer desire to impress anyone. Can you imagine the relief when you don\'t have to impress anybody anymore? Oh, what a relief. Happiness at last!","This is what Wisdom means: To be changed without the slightest effort on your part, to be transformed, believe it or not, merely by waking to the reality that is not words , that lies beyond the reach of words. If you are fortunate enough to be Awakened thus, you will know why the finest language is the one that is not spoken, the finest action is the one that is not done and the finest change is the one that is not willed.","These things will destroy the human race: politics without principle, progress without compassion, wealth without work, learning without silence, religion without fearlessness and worship without awareness.","When the eye is unobstructed, the result is sight. When the ear is unobstructed, the result is hearing. When the mind is unobstructed the result is truth. When the heart is unobstructed, the result is joy and love.","Is it possible for the rose to say, \\"I will give my fragrance to the good people who smell me, but I will withhold it from the bad?\\" Or is it possible for the lamp to say, \\"I will give my light to the good people in this room, but I will withhold it from the evil people\\"? Or can a tree say, \\"I\'ll give my shade to the good people who rest under me, but I will withhold it from the bad\\"? These are images of what love is about.","What I really enjoy is not you; it\'s something that\'s greater than both you and me.  It is something that I discovered, a kind of symphony, a kind of orchestra that plays one melody in your presence, but when you depart, the orchestra doesn\'t stop.  When I meet someone else, it plays another melody, which is also very delightful.  And when I\'m alone, it continues to play.","Understand your darkness and it will vanish; then you will know what light is. Understand your nightmare for what it is and it will stop; then you will wake up to reality. Understand your false beliefs and they will drop; then you will know the taste of happiness.","A nice definition of an awakened person: a person who no longer marches to the drums of society, a person who dances to the tune of the music that springs up from within.","Another illusion is that external events have the power to hurt you, that other people have the power to hurt you. They don\'t. It\'s you who give this power to them.","As the great Confucius said, \\"The one who would be in constant happiness must frequently change.\\" Flow. But we keep looking back, don\'t we? We cling to things in the past and cling to things in the present...Do you want to enjoy a symphony? Don\'t hold on to a few bars of the music. Don\'t hold on to a couple of notes. Let them pass, let them flow. The whole enjoyment of a symphony lies in your readiness to allow the notes to pass.","You can never be free\\nas long as you have an ego to defend.","You see persons and things not as they are but as you are.","Both what you run from-\\n and what you yearn for -\\n are within you.","As soon as you look at the world through an ideology you are finished. No reality fits an ideology. Life is beyond that. That is why people are always searching for a meaning to life. But life has no meaning; it cannot have meaning because meaning is a formula; meaning is something that makes sense to the mind. Every time you make sense out of reality, you bump into something that destroys the sense you made . Meaning is only found when you go beyond meaning.","Most people tell you they want to get out of kindergarten, but don\'t believe them. Don\'t believe them! All they want you to do is to mend their broken toys. \\"Give me back my wife. Give me back my job. Give me back my money. Give me back my reputation, my success.\\" This is what they want; they want their toys replaced. That\'s all. Even the best psychologist will tell you that, that people don\'t really want to be cured. What they want is relief; a cure is painful.","\u200e\\"I have no fear of losing u, for you aren\'t an object of my property, or anyone else\'s. I love you as you are, without attachment, without fears, without conditions, without egoism, trying not to absorb you. I love you freely because I love your freedom, as well as mine.","The philosopher Diogenes was eating bread and lentils for supper. He was seen by the philosopher Aristippus, who lived comfortably by flattering the king. Said Aristippus, \\"If you would learn to be subservient to the king you would not have to live on lentils.\\" Said Diogenes, \\"Learn to live on lentils and you will not have to be subservient to the king.","Perfect love casts out fear. Where there is love there are no demands, no expectations, no dependency. I do not demand that you make me happy; my happiness does not lie in you. If you were to leave me, I will not feel sorry for myself; I enjoy your company immensely, but I do not cling.","\\"What is love?\\"; \\"The total absence of fear,\\" said the Master; \\"What is it we fear?\\"; \\"Love,\\" said the Master.","There\'s only one reason why you\'re not experiencing bliss at this present moment, and it\'s because you\'re thinking or focusing on what you don\'t have....But, right now you have everything you need to be in bliss.","Do you want a sign that you\'re asleep? Here it is: you\'re suffering. Suffering is a sign that you\'re out of touch with the truth. Suffering is given to you that you might open your eyes to the truth, that you might understand that there\'s falsehood somewhere, just as physical pain is given to you so you will understand that there is disease or illness somewhere. Suffering occurs when you clash with reality. When your illusions clash with reality, when your falsehoods clash with truth, then you have suffering. Otherwise there is no suffering.","The way to really live is to die. The passport to living is to imagine yourself in your grave. Imagine you\'re lying in your coffin....Now look at your problems from that viewpoint. Changes everything, doesn\'t it?","Let\u2019s suppose that rain washes out a picnic. Who is feeling negative? The rain? Or you? What\u2019s causing the negative feeling? The rain or your reaction? When you bump your knee against a table, the table\u2019s fine. It\u2019s busy being what it was made to be \u2013 a table. The pain is in your knee, not in the table. The mystics keep trying to tell us that reality is all right. Reality is not problematic. Problems exist only in the human mind. We might add: in the stupid, sleeping human mind.","All that you give to others you are giving to yourself.","All is well, all is well. Though everything is a mess, all is well.","Suffering is given to you that you might open your eyes to the truth.","There is yet another illusion, that it is important to be respectable, to be loved and appreciated, to be important. Many say we have a natural urge to be loved and appreciated, to belong. That\u2019s false. Drop this illusion and you will find happiness. We have a natural urge to be free, a natural urge to love, but not to be loved.","No person on earth has the power to make you unhappy. There is no event on earth that has the power to disturb you or hurt you. No event, condition, situation, or person. Nobody told you this; they told you the opposite. That\'s why you\'re in the mess you\'re in right now. That is why you\'re asleep. They never told you this. But it\'s self-evident.","Spirituality means waking up.  Most people, even though they don\'t know it, are asleep.  They\'re born asleep, they live asleep, they marry in their sleep, they breed children in their sleep, they die in their sleep without ever waking up.  They never understand the loveliness and the beauty of this thing that we call human existence.","What you are aware of you are in control of; what you are not aware of is in control of you.","The three most difficult things for a human being are not physical feats or intellectual achievements. They are, first, returning love for hate; second, including the excluded; third, admitting that you are wrong.","You are never in love with anyone. You\'re only in love with your prejudiced and hopeful idea of that person.","Those who make no mistakes are making the biggest mistakes of all - they are attempting nothing new.","The butterfly in a caterpillar: the eagle in an egg; the saint in a selfish human being.","Waking up is unpleasant, you know. You are nice and comfortable in bed. It is irritating to be woken up. That\'s the reason the wise guru will not attempt to wake people up. I hope I\'m going to be wise here and make no attempt whatsoever to wake you up if you are asleep. It is really none of my business, even though I say to you at times, \\"Wake up!\\" My business is to do my thing, to dance my dance. If you profit from it fine; if you don\'t, too bad! As the Arabs say, \\"The nature of rain is the same, but it makes thorns grow in the marshes and flowers in the gardens.\\"","Loneliness is not cured by human company. Loneliness is cured by contact with reality.","Enlightenment is: absolute cooperation with the inevitable.","A good teacher offers practice, a bad one offers theories.","You do not have to change for God to love you.","the tragedy of an attachment is that if its object is not attained it causes unhappiness. But if it is attained, it does not cause happiness \u2013 it merely causes a flash of pleasure followed by weariness, and it is always accompanied, of course, by the anxiety that you may lose the object of your attachment.","People mistakenly assume that their thinking is done by their head; it is actually done by the heart which first dictates the conclusion, then commands the head to provide the reasoning that will defend it.","When you come to see you are not as wise today as you thought you were yesterday, you are wiser today.","Understand the obstructions you are putting in the way of love, freedom, and happiness and they will drop. Turn on the light of awareness and the darkness will disappear. Happiness is not something you acquire; love is not something you produce; love is not something you have; love is something that has you.","Are you your clothes? Are you your name? Are you your profession? Stop identifying with them. They come and go","Religion is the finger pointing to God. People are too busy licking the finger to notice where it\'s pointing.","I\'m going to write a book someday and the title will be I\'m an Ass, You\'re an Ass. That\'s the most liberating, wonderful thing in the world, when you openly admit you\'re an ass. It\'s wonderful. When people tell me, You\'re wrong I say, What can you expect of an ass?","All conflict comes from attachment.","You know, all mystics - Catholic, Christian, non-Christian, no matter what their theology, no matter what their religion - are unanimous on one thing: that all is well, all is well. Though everything is a mess, all is well. Strange paradox, to be sure. But, tragically, most people never get to see that all is well because they are asleep. They are having a nightmare.","All suffering comes from a person\'s inability to sit still and be alone.","Anytime you have a negative feeling toward anyone, you\'re living in an illusion. There\'s something seriously wrong with you. You\'re not seeing reality. Something inside of you has to change. But what do we generally do when we have a negative feeling? \\"He is to blame, she is to blame. She\'s got to change.\\" No! The world\'s all right. The one who has to change is you.","What, concretely, is Enlightenment ?\\" \\"Seeing Reality as it is,\\" said the Master. \\"Doesn\'t everyone see Reality as it is?\\" \\"Oh, no! Most people see it as they think it is.\\" \\"What\'s the difference?\\" \\"The difference between thinking you are drowning in a stormy sea and knowing you cannot drown because there isn\'t any water in sight for miles around.","Say goodbye to golden yesterdays: or your heart will never learn to love the present.","There is another more subtle way in which the innocence of childhood is lost:  when the child is infected with the desire to become somebody. Contemplate the crowds of people who are striving might and main to become, not what Nature intended them to be- musicians, cooks, mechanics, carpenters, gardeners, inventors- but \\"somebody\\":  to become successful, famous, powerful; to become something that will bring not quiet and self-fulfillment, but self-glorification and self-expansion","You\'re so ashamed of your past; drop it! You\'re so proud of your past; drop it!","You only change what you understand. What you do not understand and are not aware of, you repress. You dont change. But when you understand it, it changes.","Step by step, let whatever happens happen. Real change will come when it is brought about, not by your ego, but by reality. Awareness releases reality to change you.","Don\'t ask the world to change....you change first.","Behold God beholding you...and smiling.","Said the monk: \\"All these mountains and rivers and the earth and stars - where do they come from?\\" Said the master: \\"Where does your question come from?\\"","May the peace of God disturb you always.","You have to understand, my dears, that the shortest distance between truth and a human being is a story.","God in heaven holds each person by a string. When you sin, you cut the string. Then God ties it up again. Making a knot, bringing you a little closer to Him. Again and again your sins cut the string and with each knot God keeps drawing you closer and closer.","What is my identity ?\\" \\"Nothing,\\" said the Master. \\"You mean that I am an emptiness and a void?\\" said the incredulous disciple. \\"Nothing that can be labeled.\\" said the Master.","A prisoner lived in solitary confinement for years. He saw and spoke to no one and his meals were served through an opening in the wall. One day an ant came into his cell. The man contemplated it in fascination as it crawled around the room. He held it in the palm of his hand the better to observe it, gave it a grain or two, and kept it under his tin cup at night. One day it suddenly struck him that it had taken him ten long years of solitary confinement to open his eyes to the loveliness of an ant.","Nothing has changed but my attitude, therefore, everything has changed.","When God means you to be a healer he sends you patients; when he makes you a teacher he sends you pupils; when he destines you to be a Master he sends you stories.","Ordinarily, everything we do is in our self-interest. Everything.","If what you said was true, where was the need to shout?","Wisdom can be learned. But it cannot be taught.","Love springs from awareness.","My life is like shattered glass.\\" said the visitor. \\"My soul is tainted with evil. Is there any hope for me? \\"Yes,\\" said the Master. \\"There is something whereby each broken thing is bound again and every stain made clean.\\" \\"What?\\" \\"Forgiveness\\" \\"Whom do I forgive?\\" \\"Everyone: Life, God, your neighbor especially yourself.\\" \\"How is that done?\\" \\"By understanding that no one is to blame,\\" said the Master. \\"NO ONE.","We live in a flash of light; evening comes and it is night forever. It\'s only a flash and we waste it. We waste it with our anxiety, our worries, our concerns, our burdens.","If what you seek is Truth, there is one thing you must have above all else.\u201d \u201cI know. An overwhelming passion for it.\u201d \u201cNo. An unremitting readiness to admit you may be wrong.","\\"What is the secret of your serenity?\\" Said the master: \\"Wholehearted cooperation with the inevitable.\\"","Extend \\n your arms \\n in welcome \\n to the future. \\n The best \\n is yet to come!","Sin is a refusal to grow, a refusal to love, a refusal to get committed, to be concerned, and to take risks.","There comes a point in your life when you become stark raving insane, commit suicide or become a mystic.","If you search within your heart, you will find something there that will make it possible for you to understand: a spark of disenchantment and discontent, which if fanned into flame will become a raging forest fire that will burn up the whole of the illusory world you are living in, thereby unveiling to your wondering eyes the kingdom that you have always lived in unsuspectingly.","If you never condemned you would never need to forgive.","Happiness is our natural state. Happiness is the natural state of little children, to whom the kingdom belongs until they have been polluted and contaminated by the stupidity of society and\\nculture.","\\"I seek the meaning of existence,\\" said the stranger. \\"You are of course assuming,\\" said the Master, \\"that existence has a meaning.\\" \\"Doesn\'t it?\\" \\"When you experience existence as it is - not as you think it is you will discover that your question has no meaning,\\" said the Master.","The present moment is never intolerable. What\'s intolerable is what\'s going to happen in the next four hours. To have your body here at 8 pm and your mind at 10:30 pm, that\'s what causes us suffering.","Take away human beings from this planet and life would go on, nature would go on in all its loveliness and violence. Where would the problem be? No problem. You created the problem. You are the problem. You identified with \\"me\\" and that is the problem. The feeling is in you, not in reality.","People who deliberate fully before they take a step will spend their lives on one leg","Whatever is truly alive must die. Look at the flowers; only plastic flowers never die.","Problems only exist in the human mind.","When you get rid of your fear of failure, your tensions about succeeding... you can be yourself. Relaxed. You\'ll no longer be driving with your brakes on.","Silence is not the absence of sound, but the absence of self.","Pleasant experiences make life delightful. Painful experiences lead to growth.","To a visitor who asked to become his disciple the Master said, \\"You may live with me, but don\'t become my follower.\\" \\"Whom, then, shall I follow?\\" \\"No one. The day you follow someone you cease to follow Truth .","If I haven\'t received any grace today, then I was not at home. This is because God is sending deliveries constantly.","What can I do to see Reality as it is?\\" The master smiled and said, \\"I have good news and bad news for you, my friend.\\" \\"What\'s the bad news?\\" \\"There\'s nothing you can do to see it is a gift.\\" \\"And what\'s the good news?\\" \\"There\'s nothing you can do to see it is a gift.","What is a loving heart?  A loving heart is sensitive to the whole of life, to all persons; a loving heart doesn\'t harden itself to any persons or things.","One day, a philosopher asked, \\"What is the purpose of creation?\\" \\"Lovemaking,\\" said the Master. Later, to his disciples, he said, \\"Before creation, love was. After creation, love was made. When love is consummated, creation will cease to be, and love will be forever.\\"","\\"My former master taught me to accept birth and death.\\" \\"Then what have you come to me for?\\" asked the master. \\"To learn to accept what lies in between.\\"","Concepts are always frozen. Reality flows.","You\'ve got to drop something. You\'ve got to drop illusions. You don\'t have to add anything in order to be happy; you\'ve got to drop something. Life is easy, life is delightful. It\'s only hard on your illusions, your ambitions, your greed, your cravings.","Any time you are with anyone or think of anyone you must say to yourself: I am dying and this person too is dying, attempting the while to experience the truth of the words you are saying. If every one of you agrees to practice this, bitterness will die out, harmony will arise.","The disciples were absorbed in a discussion of Lao-Tzu\'s dictum: \\"Those who know, do not say; Those who say, do not know.\\" When the master entered, they asked him what the words meant. Said the master, \\"Which of you knows the fragrance of a rose?\\" All of them indicated that they knew. Then he said, \\"Put it into words.\\" All of them were silent.","You sanctify whatever you are grateful for.","A Jesuit once wrote a note to Father Arrupe, his superior general, asking him about the relative value of communism, socialism and capitalism. Father Arrupe gave him a lovely reply. He said, \\"A system is about as good or as bad as the people who use it.\\" People with golden hearts would make capitalism or communism or socialism work beautifully.","the greatest learning of the ages lies in accepting life exactly as it comes to us.","You have within yourself the answer to every question you propose - if you only knew how to look for it.  In the Land of the spirit, you cannot walk by the light of someone else\'s lamp.  You want to borrow mine.  I\'d rather teach you how to make your own.","Wouldn\'t it be wonderful if we had a world where everybody said, \'We don\'t know?\' The fact is that you\'re surrounded -God and you don\'t see God, because you KNOW ABOUT God. The final barrier to the vision of God is your God concept. You miss God because you think you know. The highest knowledge of God is to know God as unknowable. All revelations, however divine, are never any more than a finger pointing at the moon. As we say in the East, \'When the sage points to the moon, all the idiot sees is the finger\'.","How sad if we pass through life and never see it with the eyes of a child.","Wisdom comes to those who learn nothing, unlearn everything.","A zealous disciple expressed a desire to teach others the Truth and asked the Master what he thought about this. The Master said, \\"Wait.\\" Each year the disciple would return with the same request and each time the Master would give him the same reply: \\"Wait.\\" One day he said to the Master, \\"When will I be ready to teach?\\" Said the Master, \\"When your excessive eagerness to teach has left you.","One always treads with a joyful step when one has dropped the burden called the ego.","Negative feelings are in you, not in reality. Stop trying to change reality. That\'s crazy! Stop trying to change the other person. We spend all our time and energy trying to change external circumstances, trying to change our spouses, our bosses, our friends, our enemies, and everybody else. We don\'t have to change anything. Negative feelings are in you.","People kill for money or for power. But the most ruthless murderers are those who kill for their ideas.","A man who took great pride in his lawn found himself with a large crop of dandelions. He tried every method he knew to get rid of them. Still they plagued him. Finally he wrote the department of agriculture. He enumerated all the things he had tried and closed his letter with the question: \\"What shall I do now?\\" In due course the reply came: \\"We suggest you learn to love them.\\"","The only way to change is by changing your understanding.","A newly married couple said, \\"What shall we do to make our love endure?\\" Said the Master, \\"Love other things together\\".","If the heart is unobstructed, the result is love.","Isn\'t there such a thing as social liberation?\\" \\"Of course there is,\\" said the Master. \\"How would you describe it?\\" \\"Liberation from the need to belong to the herd.","You keep insisting, I feel good because the world is right! Wrong! The world is right because I feel good. That\'s what all the mystics are saying.","A disciple was one day recalling how Buddha , Jesus , Mohammed were branded as rebels and heretics by their contemporaries. Said the Master, Nobody can be said to have attained the pinnacle of Truth until a thousand sincere people have denounced him for blasphemy .","Happiness is not something you acquire; love is not something you produce; love is not something you have; love is something that has you.","The Master would insist that the final barrier to our attaining God was the word and concept God.","The poor think they will be happy when they become rich. The rich think they will be happy when they are rid of their ulcers.","Rare indeed, is the relationship in which the other is not cultivated for what one can get for oneself.","One year of life is worth more than twenty years of hibernation.","Is there life before death? - that is the question!","The devil has a Ph.D. in perfect logic.","Problems exist only in the human mind.","The genius of a composer is found in the notes of his music; but analyzing the notes will not reveal his genius. The poet\'s greatness is contained in his words; yet the study of his words will not disclose his inspiration. God reveals himself in creation; but scrutinize creation as minutely as you wish, you will not find God, any more than you will find the soul through careful examination of your body.","When you cling, life is destroyed; when you hold on to anything, you cease to live.","You are only a disciple because your eyes are closed. The day you open them you will see there is nothing you can learn from me or anyone.","Because you cannot see outside of you what you fail to see inside.","There is no explanation you can give that will explain away all the sufferings and evil and torture and destruction and hunger in the world! You\'ll never explain it. Because life is a mystery, which means your thinking mind cannot make sense of it. For that you\'ve got to wake up and then you\'ll suddenly realize that reality is not the problem, you are the problem.","The only way someone can be of help to you is in challenging your ideas. If you\'re ready to listen and if you\'re ready to be challenged, there\'s one thing that you can do, but no one can help you. What is this most important thing of all? It\'s called self-observation.","To a woman who complained about her destiny the Master said, \\"It is you who make your destiny.\\" \\"But surely I am not responsible for being born a woman?\\" \\"Being born a woman isn\'t destiny. That is fate. Destiny is how you accept your womanhood and what you make of it.\\"","If you make me your authority, you harm yourself because you will not see things for yourself, and you harm me too because you refuse to see me as I am.","If you don\'t look at things through your concepts, you\'ll never be bored. Every single thing is unique.","The spiritual quest is a journey without distance. You travel from where you are right now To where you have always been. From ignorance to recognition.","Spirituality practiced in the state of activity is incomparably superior to that practiced in a state of withdrawel.","It\'s only when you become love - in other words, when you have dropped your illusions and attachments - that you will \\"know.\\" As you identify less and less with the \\"me,\\" you will be more at ease with everybody and with everything.","You\'re not living until it doesn\'t matter a tinker\'s damn to you whether you live or die. At that point you live. When you\'re ready to lose your life, you live it.","Most people don\'t live aware lives. They live mechanical lives, mechanical thoughts - generally somebody else\'s - mechanical emotions, mechanical actions, mechanical reactions.","Drop your false ideas.  See through people.  If you see through yourself, you will see through everyone.  Then you will love them.  Otherwise you spend the whole time grappling with your wrong notions of them, with your illusions that are constantly crashing against reality.","To fight evil with activity is like fighting darkness with one\'s hands. So what you need is light, not fit.","So love the thought of death, love it.","Everybody was talking about the religious man who committed suicide. While no one in the monastery approved of the man\'s action, some say they admired his faith. Faith?\\" said the Master. He had the courage of his convictions, didn\'t he?\\" That was fanaticism, not faith. Faith demands a greater courage still: to reexamine one\'s convictions and reject them if they do not fit the facts.","As the Japanese Zen masters say, \u201cDon\'t seek the truth; just drop your opinions\u201d. Drop your theories; don\'t seek the truth.","When I speak, you must not listen to the words, my dear. Listen to the Silence.","The Rose does not preen herself to catch my eye. She blooms because she blooms. A saint is a saint until he knows he is one.","As the Arabs say, \\"The nature of rain is the same, but it makes thorns grow in the marshes and flowers in the gardens.","A writer arrived at the monastery to write a book about the Master. \\"People say you are a genius . Are you?\\" he asked. \\"You might say so.\\" said the Master, none too modestly. \\"And what makes one a genius?\\" \\"The ability to recognize.\\" \\"Recognize what?\\" \\"The butterfly in a caterpillar: the eagle in an egg; the saint in a selfish human being.","When someone offends you, you can raise your spirits to heights where offenses cannot reach.","To relate is to react. To react is to understand oneself. To understand oneself is to be enlightened. Relationships are schools for enlightenment.","The Master made it his task to destroy systematically every doctrine, every belief, every concept of the divine, for these things, which were originally intended as pointers, were now being taken as descriptions. He loved to quote the Eastern saying \\"When the sage points to the moon, all that the idiot sees is the finger.","A disciple asked, \\"Who is a Master?\\" The Master replied, \\"Anyone to whom it is given to let go of the ego. Such a person\'s life is then a masterpiece.","The master never seemed to have his fill of gazing at his firstborn child. \\"What do you want him to be when he grows up?\\" someone asked. \\"Outrageously happy,\\" said the master.","A religious belief is not a statement about Reality, but a hint, a clue about something that is a mystery, beyond the grasp of human thought. In short, a religious belief is only a finger pointing to the moon. Some religious people never get beyond the study of the finger. Others are engaged in sucking it. Others yet use the finger to gouge their eyes out. These are the bigots whom religion has made blind. Rare indeed is the religionist who is sufficiently detached from the finger to see what it is indicating - these are those who, having gone beyond belief, are taken for blasphemers.","Can one talk about the ocean to a frog in a well or about the divine to people who are restricted by their concepts?","Every word, every image used for God is a distortion more than a description.","A thought is a screen, not a mirror; that is why you live in a thought envelope, untouched by Reality.","Obedience keeps the rules.

I was just doing my dance. It helped you, that\'s wonderful. Congratulations to you. No credit to me.","The sun and its light, the ocean and the wave, the singer and his song \u2014 not one. Not two.","It is a great mystery that though the human heart longs for Truth, in which alone it finds liberation and delight, the first reaction of human beings to Truth is one of hostility and fear!","Tell me,\\" said the atheist , \\"Is there a God really?\\" Said the master, \\"If you want me to be perfectly honest with you, I will not answer.\\" Later the disciples demanded to know why he had not answered. \\"Because the question is unanswerable,\\" said the Master. \\"So you are an atheist?\\" \\"Certainly not. The atheist makes the mistake of denying that of which nothing may be said... and the theist makes the mistake of affirming it.","Take the leap! You cannot cross a chasm in little jumps.","The feigning sleeper can delude others he cannot delude himself. The false mystic, unfortunately, can delude both others and himself.","People who want to rise above a well-cooked meal and a well-tailored garment, are out of their spiritual minds.","To those who seek to protect their ego true Peace brings only disturbance.","All I did was sit on the riverbank handing out river water.

That is what your mind can become - flabby, covered with layers of fat till it becomes too dull and lazy to think, to observe, to explore, to discover ... not wanting to be disturbed or questioned into wakefulness.","What is the work of a Master?\\" said a solemn-faced visitor. \\"To teach people to laugh ,\\" said the Master gravely.","You are so proud of your intelligence,\\" said the master. \\"You are like a like a condemned man, proud of the vastness of his prison cell.","You can will an act of service but you cannot will love.","Said the master: \\"Where does your question come from?\\"","A lost coin is found by means of a candle; the deepest truth is found by means of a simple story.","Name one practical, down-to-earth effect of spirituality,\\" said the skeptic who was ready for an argument. \\"Here\'s one,\\" said the Master. \\"When someone offends you, you can raise your spirits to heights where offenses cannot reach.","My experience is that it\'s precisely the ones who don\'t know what to do with this life who are all hot and bothered about what they are going to do with another life.","And increasingly - you know this and so do I we\'re losing the youth everywhere. They hate us; they are not interested in having more fears and guilt laid on them. They\'re not interested in more sermons and exhortations. But they are interested in learning about love. How can I be happy? How can I live? How can I taste the marvelous things that the mystics speak of?","The seeker says, \\"I do not know.\\" That takes honesty. The master says, \\"I do not know.\\" That takes a mystic\'s mind that knows things through non-knowing.

The only tragedy there is in the world is ignorance; all evil comes from that.","Doesn\'t everyone see Reality as it is?","The Master persistently warned against the attempt to encompass Reality in a concept or a name. A scholar in mysticism once asked, \\"When you speak of BEING, sir, is it eternal, transcendent being you speak of, or transient, contingent being?\\" The Master closed his eyes in thought.

Happiness is the natural state of little children, to whom the kingdom belongs until they have been polluted and contaminated by the stupidity of society and culture. To acquire happiness you don\'t have to do anything, because happiness cannot be acquired. Does anybody know why? Because we have it already. How can you acquire what you already have? Then why don\'t you experience it? Because you\'ve got to drop something. You\'ve got to drop illusions. You don\'t have to add anything in order to be happy; you\'ve got to drop something. Life is easy, life is delightful. It\'s only hard on your illusions, your ambitions, your greed, your cravings. Do you know where these things come from? From having identified with all kinds of labels!","If what you seek is Truth, there is one thing you must have above all else. \u201cI know.

It took me years to get over it.\\" That\'s what spirituality is all about, you know: unlearning. Unlearning all the rubbish they taught you.","We see people and things not as they are, but as we are.","The Master made it his task to destroy systematically everydoctrine, every belief, every concept of the divine, for thesethings, which were originally intended as pointers, were nowbeing taken as descriptions.He loved to quote the Eastern saying \\"When the sage pointsto the moon, all that the idiot sees is the finger.","If you find me charming, it means that right now you\u2019re in a good mood, nothing more.","Stories are the creative conversion of life itself into a more powerful, clearer, more meaningful experience.

Then comes a plateau. Then once again the weary cycle: attraction, pleasure, attachment, fulfillment, satisfaction, boredom. All of this mixed with the anxieties, the jealousies, the possessiveness, the sorrow, the pain, that make the cycle a roller coaster. When you have gone repeatedly around and around the cycle, a time finally comes when you have had enough and want to call a halt to the whole process. And if you are lucky enough not to run into something or someone else that catches your eye, you will have at least attained a fragile peace. That is the most that life can give you; and you can mistakenly equate this state with freedom and you die without ever having known what it means to be really free and to love.","Of what use is it to be tolerant of others if you are convinced that you are right and everyone who disagrees with you is wrong? That isn\u2019t tolerance but condescension.","Everybody was talking about the religious man who committed suicide. While no one in the monastery approved of the man\'s action, some say they admired his faith.Faith?\\" said the Master.He had the courage of his convictions, didn\'t he?\\"That was fanaticism, not faith. Faith demands a greater courage still: to reexamine one\'s convictions and reject them if they do not fit the facts.","To be properly wicked, you do not have to break the Law. Just observe it to the letter.","You must cultivate activities that you love. You must discover work that you do, not for its utility, but for itself, whether it succeeds or not, whether you are praised for it or not, whether you are loved and rewarded for it or not, whether people know about it and are grateful to you for it or not. How many activities can you count in your life that you engage in simply because they delight you and grip your soul? Find them out, cultivate them, for they are your passport to freedom and to love.","What is love?\\"; \\"The total absence of fear,\\" said the Master; \\"What is it we fear?\\"; \\"Love,\\" said the Master.","A story is the shortest distance between a human being and truth.","Do you think you help people because you are in love with them? Well, I\u2019ve got news for you. You are never in love with anyone. You\u2019re only in love with your prejudiced and hopeful idea of that person.

The spiritual person knows uncertainty\u2014a state of mind unknown to the religious fanatic.","It isn\'t falling in that causes you to drown, it\'s staying in.","If you love truth, be a lover of silence. Silence like the sunlight will illuminate you in God and will deliver you from the phantoms of ignorance.\u2026 In the beginning we have to force ourselves to be silent. But then there is born something that draws us to silence.\u2026 If only you practice this, untold light will dawn on you in consequence \u2026 after a while a certain sweetness is born in the heart of this exercise and the body is drawn almost by force to remain in silence.","When you renounce something, you\u2019re tied to it. The only way to get out of this is to see through it. Don\u2019t renounce it, see through it. Understand its true value and you won\u2019tneed to renounce it; it will just drop from your hands. But of course, if you don\u2019t see that, if you\u2019re hypnotized into thinking that you won\u2019t be happy without this, that, or the other thing, you\u2019re stuck. What we need to do for you is not what so-called spirituality attempts to do\u2014namely, to get you to make sacrifices, to renounce things. That\u2019s useless. You\u2019re still asleep. What we need to do is to help you understand, understand, understand. If you understood, you\u2019d simply drop the desire for it. This is another way of saying: If you woke up, you\u2019d simply drop the desire for it.","Put this program into action, a thousand times: (a) identify the negative feelings in you; (b) understand that they are in you, not in the world, not in external reality; (c) do not see them as an essential part of \u201cI; these things come and go; (d) understand that when you change, everything changes.\u201d","SERENITY \u201cAre there ways for gauging one\u2019s spiritual strength? \u201cMany.\u201d \u201cGive us one.\u201d \u201cFind out how often you become disturbed in the course of a single day.\u201d","See how you attempt to bring about change\u2014both in yourself and in others\u2014through the use of punishment and reward, through discipline and control, through sermonizing and guilt, through greed and pride, ambition and vanity, rather than through loving acceptance and patience, painstaking understanding and vigilant awareness.","What\u2019s the earthly use of putting a man on the moon when we cannot live on the earth?","Have you ever attempted to organize something like peace? The moment you do, you have power conflicts and group wars within the organization.

As you begin to understand this, you stop making demands on yourself, you stop having expectations of yourself, you stop pushing yourself and you understand. Nourish yourself on wholesome food, good wholesome food. I\u2019m not talking about actual food, I\u2019m talking about sunsets, about nature, about a good movie, about a good book, about enjoyable work, about good company, and hopefully you will break your addictions to those other feelings.","How does one cope with evil? Not by fighting it but by understanding it. In understanding, it disappears. How does one cope with darkness? Not with one\'s fist.

But when you turn on the light of awareness, it melts.","To know reality you have to know beyond knowing.","Happiness is a state of nonillusion, of dropping the illusion.","For to love persons is to have died to the need for persons and to be utterly alone.","Most people end up being conformists; they adapt to prison life. A few become reformers; they fight for better lighting, better ventilation. Hardly anyone becomes a rebel, a revolutionary who breaks down the prison walls.

The chances that you will wake up are in direct proportion to the amount of truth you can take without running away.","What makes you happy or unhappy is not the world and the people around you, but the thinking in your head. As well","If you ever allow yourself to see it will be the death of you. And that is why love is so terrifying, for to love is to see and to see is to die.

What does it mean to love? It means to see a person, a thing, a situation, as it really is and not as you imagine it to be, and to give it the response it deserves. You cannot love what you do not even see.","God went mad out of love for us. Then we must be very lovely. What we have stressed in the past is how lovely God must be that he can love us like this.

Otherwise you wouldn\u2019t be hoping. But then, you forget that you have it all right now anyway, and you don\u2019t know it. Why not concentrate on the now instead of hoping for better times in the future? Why not understand the now instead of forgetting it and hoping for the future? Isn\u2019t the future just another trap?","What you are aware of you are in control of; what you are not aware of is in control of you. You are always a slave to what you\u2019re not aware of. When you\u2019re aware of it, you\u2019re free from it. It\u2019s there, but you\u2019re not affected by it. You\u2019re not controlled by it; you\u2019re not enslaved by it.

Otherwise, it is not the person that you love but the idea that you have formed of this person, or this person as the object of your desire, not as he or she is in themselves.","Hardly anyone has been told the following truth: In order to be genuinely happy there is one and only one thing you need to do: get deprogrammed, get rid of those attachments.","So you must \u201creceive your demons, because when you fight them, you empower them.\u201d","Repentance brings an intense desire for God, deep gratitude, and a growth in self-awareness that increases our freedom to love.","All suffering is caused by my identifying myself with something, whether that something is within me or outside of me.","So, we were born happy. We lost it. We were born with the gift of life. We lost it. We\u2019ve got to rediscover it. Why did we lose it? Because we were working actively.

By teaching us to have desires so intense that we would refuse to be happy unless they were fulfilled.","Most people tell you they want to get out of kindergarten, but don\u2019t believe them. Don\u2019t believe them! All they want you to do is to mend their broken toys. \u201cGive me back my wife. Give me back my job. Give me back my money. Give me back my reputation, my success. This is what they want; they want their toys replaced. That\u2019s all. Even the best psychologist will tell you that, that people don\u2019t really want to be cured.

Here it is: Drop your false ideas. See through people. If you see through yourself, you will see through everyone. Then you will love them. Otherwise you spend the whole time grappling with your wrong notions of them, with your illusions that are constantly crashing against reality.","Because agreement and disagreement have to do with words and concepts and theories.

He thinks more of winning than of shooting, and the need to win drains him of power.","If you wish to attain to lasting happiness you must be ready to hate father, mother, even your own life and to take leave of all your possessions. How? Not by renouncing them or giving them up because what you give up violently you are forever bound to. But rather by seeing them for the nightmare they are; and then, whether you keep them or not, they will have lost their grip over you, their power to hurt you, and you will be out of your dream at last, out of your darkness, your fear, your unhappiness.","A tu gde je strah nema ljubavi, jer uvek mrzimo ono \u010dega se pla\u0161imo.","Every sparrow is unlike every other sparrow despite the similarities.","And more assumptions: A married couple was returning from the funeral of Uncle George, who had lived with them for twenty years and had been such a nuisance that he almost succeeded in wrecking their marriage. \u201cThere is something I have to say to you, dear, said the man. \u201cIf it hadn\u2019t been for my love for you, I wouldn\u2019t have put up with your Uncle George for a single day.\u201d \u201cMy Uncle George!\u201d she exclaimed in horror. \u201cI thought he was your Uncle George!\u201d","What we need is not just  action  that will bring about change but  sight that will bring about love.","I feel good because the world is right.

If you wish to love you must learn to see again. And if you wish to see you must give up your drug. You must tear away from your being the roots of society that have penetrated to the marrow. You must drop out. Externally everything will go on as before, you will continue to be in the world, but no longer of it. And in your heart you will now be free at last and utterly alone.

This is far from easy because to understand what you are requires complete freedom from all desire to change what you are into something else.","On the question of his own enlightenment the Master always remained reticent, even though the disciples tried every means to get him to talk. All the information they had on this subject was what the Master once said to his youngest son, who wanted to know what his father felt when he became enlightened.

And if they profit, that\u2019s fine, and if they don\u2019t, too bad!","A story is the shortest distance between a human being and the truth.","Suppose somebody showed us a way whereby we would truly love one another, and be at peace, be at love. Can you think of anything more practical than that? But, instead, you have people thinking that big business is more practical, that politics is more practical, that science is more practical. What\u2019s the earthly use of putting a man on the moon when we cannot live on the earth?","I don\u2019t identify with the feeling. \u201cI is not that feeling. \u201cI\u201d am not lonely, \u201cI\u201d am not depressed, \u201cI\u201d am not disappointed. Disappointment is there, one watches it. You\u2019d be amazed how quickly it glides away. Anything you\u2019re aware of keeps changing; clouds keep moving. As you do this, you also get all kinds of insights into why clouds were coming in the first place.\u201d","FEAR\u2014THE ROOT OF VIOLENCE Some say that there are only two things in the world: God and fear; love and fear are the only two things. There\u2019s only one evil in the world, fear. There\u2019s only one good in the world, love. It\u2019s sometimes called by other names. It\u2019s sometimes called happiness or freedom or peace or joy or God or whatever. But the label doesn\u2019t really matter. And there\u2019s not a single evil in the world that you cannot trace to fear. Not one. Ignorance and fear, ignorance caused by fear, that\u2019s where all the evil comes from, that\u2019s where your violence comes from. The person who is truly nonviolent, who is incapable of violence, is the person who is fearless. It\u2019s only when you\u2019re afraid that you become angry. Think of the last time you were angry. Go ahead. Think of the last time you were angry and search for the fear behind it. What were you afraid of losing? What were you afraid would be taken from you? That\u2019s where the anger comes from. Think of an angry person, maybe someone you\u2019re afraid of. Can you see how frightened he or she is? He\u2019s really frightened, he really is. She\u2019s really frightened or she wouldn\u2019t be angry. Ultimately, there are only two things, love and fear. In this retreat I\u2019d rather leave it like this, unstructured and moving from one thing to another and returning to themes again and again, because that\u2019s the way to really grasp what I\u2019m saying. If it doesn\u2019t hit you the first time, it might the second time, and what doesn\u2019t hit one person might hit another. I\u2019ve got different themes, but they are all about the same thing. Call it awareness, call it love, call it spirituality or freedom or awakening or whatever. It really is the same thing.","I have wandered freely in mystical traditions that are not religious and have been profoundly influenced by them. It is my church, however, that I keep returning, for she is my spiritual home.","Comprende tu oscuridad, y \xe9sta se desvanecer\xe1; entonces sabr\xe1s lo que es la luz. Comprende tu pesadilla como tal pesadilla, y \xe9sta cesar\xe1; entonces despertar\xe1s a la realidad. Comprende tus falsas creencias, y \xe9stas perder\xe1n fuerza; entonces conocer\xe1s el sabor de la felicidad.","When we talk about self-worth, are we not talking, really, about how we are reflected in the mirrors of other people\u2019s minds?","A man found an eagle\u2019s egg and put it in a nest of a barnyard hen. The eaglet hatched with the brood of chicks and grew up with them. All his life the eagle did what the barnyard chicks did, thinking he was a barnyard chicken. He scratched the earth for worms and insects. He clucked and cackled. And he would thrash his wings and fly a few feet into the air. Years passed and the eagle grew very old. One day he saw a magnificent bird above him in the cloudless sky. It glided in graceful majesty among the powerful wind currents, with scarcely a beat of its strong golden wings. The old eagle looked up in awe. \u201cWho\u2019s that? he asked. \u201cThat\u2019s the eagle, the king of the birds,\u201d said his neighbor. \u201cHe belongs to the sky. We belong to the earth\u2014we\u2019re chickens.\u201d So the eagle lived and died a chicken, for that\u2019s what he thought he was.\u201d","Now keep looking at this unpleasant situation or person until you realize that it isn\u2019t they that are causing the negative emotions. They are just going their way, being themselves, doing their thing whether right or wrong, good or bad. It is your computer that, thanks to your programming, insists on your reacting with negative emotions. You will see this better if you realize that someone with a different programming when faced with this same situation or person or event would react quite calmly, even happily. Don\u2019t stop till you have grasped this truth: The only reason why you too are not reacting calmly and happily is your computer that is stubbornly insisting that reality be reshaped to conform to its programming. Observe all of this from the outside so to speak and see the marvelous change that comes about in you. Once you have understood this truth and thereby stopped your computer from generating negative emotions you may take any action you deem fit. You may avoid the situation or the person; or you may try to change them; or you may insist on your rights or the rights of others being respected; you may even resort to the use of force. But only after you have got rid of your emotional upsets, for then your action will spring from peace and love, not from the neurotic desire to appease your computer or to conform to its programming or to get rid of the negative emotions it generates. Then you will understand how profound is the wisdom of the words: \u201cIf a man wants to sue you for your shirt, let him have your coat as well. If a man in authority makes you go one mile, go with him two. For it will have become evident to you that real oppression comes, not from people who fight you in court or from authority that subjects you to slave labor, but from your computer whose programming destroys your peace of mind the moment outside circumstances fail to conform to its demands. People have been known to be happy even in the oppressive atmosphere of a concentration camp! It is from the oppression of your programming that you need to be liberated.\u201d","The more occupied we are in the things of God, the more likely we priests are to forget what God is all about\u2014and the more complacent we\u2019re likely to become. That\u2019s the story of Jesus. Who do you think got rid of Jesus? The priests\u2014who else? The religious people. That\u2019s the terror of the Gospel, see?","If you wish to understand this, think of a little child that is given a taste for drugs. As the drug penetrates the body of the child, it becomes addicted and its whole being cries out for the drug. To be without the drug is so unbearable a torment that it seems preferable to die. Now this is exactly what society did to you when you were a child. You were not allowed to enjoy the solid, nutritious food of life: work and play and the company of people and the pleasures of the senses and the mind. You were given a taste for the drug called Approval, Appreciation, Attention, the drug called Success, Prestige, Power. Having","Is there anything I can do to make myself enlightened? As little as you can do to make the sun rise in the morning. Then of what use are the spiritual exercises you prescribe?To make sure you are not asleep when the sun begins to rise.","But to depend on another psychologically\u2014to depend on another emotionally\u2014what does that imply? It means to depend on another human being for my happiness. Think about that. Because if you do, the next thing you will be doing, whether you\u2019re aware of it or not, is demanding that other people contribute to your happiness.","A man found an eagle\u2019s egg and put it in a nest of a barnyard hen. The eaglet hatched with the brood of chicks and grew up with them. All his life the eagle did what the barnyard chicks did, thinking he was a barnyard chicken.

One day he saw a magnificent bird above him in the cloudless sky. It glided in graceful majesty among the powerful wind currents, with scarcely a beat of its strong golden wings. The old eagle looked up in awe. \u201cWho\u2019s that? he asked.\u201d","Now the tragedy of an attachment is that if its object is not attained it causes unhappiness. But if it is attained, it does not cause happiness\u2014it merely causes a flash of pleasure followed by weariness; and it is always accompanied, of course, by the anxiety that you may lose the object of your attachment. You will say, \u201cCan\u2019t I keep just one attachment? Of course. You can keep as many as you want. But for each attachment you pay a price in lost happiness. Think of this: The nature of attachments is such, that even if you satisfy many of them in the course of a single day, the one attachment that was not satisfied will prey upon your mind and make you unhappy. There\u201d","If you wish to attain to lasting happiness you must be ready to hate father, mother, even your own life and to take leave of all your possessions. How? Not by renouncing them or giving them up because what you give up violently you are forever bound to. But rather by seeing them for the nightmare they are; and then, whether you keep them or not, they will have lost their grip over you, their power to hurt you, and you will be out of your dream at last, out of your darkness, your fear, your unhappiness. So spend some time seeing each of the things you cling to for what it really is, a nightmare that causes you excitement and pleasure on the one hand but also worry, insecurity, tension, anxiety, fear, unhappiness on the other.","You want the little things that society has falsely taught you are essential for happiness. You want that.","That\u2019s what spirituality is all about, you know: unlearning. Unlearning all the rubbish they taught you.","Negative feelings are in you, not in reality. So stop trying to change reality. That\u2019s crazy! Stop trying to change the other person.","What makes you happy or unhappy is not the world and the people around you, but the thinking in your head. Might as well search for an eagle\u2019s nest on the bed of an ocean\u2014a search for happiness in the world outside you will be just as successful. If it is happiness that you seek, you can stop wasting your energy trying to cure your baldness, building up an attractive body, or changing your residence, your job, your community, your lifestyle, or even your personality. Do you realize that you could change every one of these things\u2014you could have the finest looks, the most charming personality, and the most pleasant of surroundings\u2014and still be unhappy? Deep down, you know this is true. But still you waste your effort and energy trying to get what you know cannot make you happy. Another false belief: If all of your desires are fulfilled, you will finally be happy. Not true. In fact, it is these very desires and attachments that make you tense, frustrated, nervous, insecure, and fearful. Look at your list of your attachments and desires and to each of them, say these words: \u201cDeep down in my heart, I know that even after I have gotten you, I will not get happiness. Ponder the truth of these words. The fulfillment of desire can, at the most, bring flashes of pleasure and excitement. Don\u2019t mistake them for happiness.\u201d","T\u0105 dien\u0105, lyg ty\u010dia, visi lankytojai klaus\u0117 tik vieno: kas bus po mirties.

What I would advocate is awareness, which is not the same as concentration at all. Concentration is a spotlight, a floodlight. You\u2019re open to anything that comes within the scope of your consciousness. You can be distracted from that, but when you\u2019re practicing awareness, you\u2019re never distracted.

Not by renouncing them or giving them up because what you give up violently you are forever bound to. But rather by seeing them for the nightmare they are; and then, whether you keep them or not, they will have lost their grip over you, their power to hurt you, and you will be out of your dream at last, out of your darkness, your fear, your unhappiness. So spend some time seeing each of the things you cling to for what it really is, a nightmare that causes you excitement and pleasure on the one hand but also worry, insecurity, tension, anxiety, fear, unhappiness on the other.","T\u1ed9t c\xf9ng c\u1ee7a tri th\u1ee9c nh\xe2n lo\u1ea1i v\u1ec1 Thi\xean Ch\xfaa: bi\u1ebft r\u1eb1ng m\xecnh kh\xf4ng bi\u1ebft.

For in this state your eyes will see the Savior.","Suffering is a sign that you\u2019re out of touch with the truth. Suffering is given to you that you might open your eyes to the truth, that you might understand that there\u2019s falsehood somewhere, just as physical pain is given to you so you will understand that there is disease or illness somewhere.","The shortest distance between truth and a human being is a story.","\xabSe\xf1or y Dios nuestro, conc\xe9denos la gracia de desearte con todo nuestro coraz\xf3n, para que, dese\xe1ndote, podamos buscarte y encontrarte; encontr\xe1ndote, podamos amarte; y, am\xe1ndote, podamos aborrecer todo aquello de lo que nos has redimido.

And when there is no one or nothing that has your attention the orchestra will play a music of its own; it needs no outside stimulation. You now carry in your heart a happiness that nothing outside of you can put there, and nothing can take away.","When you go out to the world because of the love that someone else has for you, you are all aglow not with your perception of reality but with the love that you have received from someone else; someone else controls the switch and when it is switched off the glow fades away.","That is how you bring about change in yourself. Not by condemnation, not by calling yourself names, but by understanding what\u2019s going on. Not by calling yourself a dirty old sinner.","How can you love someone whom you do not even see?","Most priests and religious equate prayer with thinking. That is their downfall.","Before enlightenment I used to be depressed. After enlightenment I continue to be depressed.","Seek her patronage and ask for her intercession before you start out on this way.","Could you give me the inner richness that makes it possible for you to so easily give away this thing that would have made you the richest man in the world?","This is how your beliefs originate: they are fixed, unchanging ways of looking at a reality that is not fixed and unchanging at all, but constantly moving and changing. So, it is no longer the real world that you interact with and love, but a world created by your head. It is only when you drop your beliefs, fears, and the attachments that breed them that you will be freed from the insensitivity that makes you so deaf and blind to yourself and the world.","We have been programmed to not suspect or doubt. We have been programmed to trust the assumptions that have been put into us by our tradition, culture, society, and religion. That\u2019s another part of society\u2019s brainwashing. If we are attached to power, money, property, fame, and success\u2014if we seek these things as if our happiness depended on them\u2014we will be considered a productive member of society, dynamic, and hardworking. In other words, if we pursue these things with a driving ambition that destroys the symphony of our life and makes us hard and cold and insensitive to others and to ourselves, society will look upon us as a dependable citizen, and our relatives and friends will be proud of the status that we have achieved.","B\u1ea1n c\xf3 s\u1eb5n s\xe0ng \u0111\u1eb7t c\u1ea3 cu\u1ed9c s\u1ed1ng m\xecnh v\xe0o m\u1ed9t ch\xe9n b\u1ea1c kh\xf4ng?

The great Meister Eckhart said very beautifully, \u201cGod is not attained by a process of addition to anything in the soul, but by a process of subtraction. You don\u2019t do anything to be free, you drop something. Then you\u2019re free.\u201d","It reminds me of the Irish prisoner who dug a tunnel under the prison wall and managed to escape. He comes out right in the middle of a school playground where little children are playing. Of course, when he emerges from the tunnel he can\u2019t restrain himself anymore and begins to jump up and down, crying, \u201cI\u2019m free, I\u2019m free, I\u2019m free! A little girl there looks at him scornfully and says, \u201cThat\u2019s nothing.

It doesn\u2019t matter to you whether you win or lose. Now there\u2019s human living for you. That\u2019s what life is all about.","Recall the feeling you have when someone praises you, when you are approved, accepted, applauded. Now contrast that with the kind of feeling that arises within you when you look at the sunset or the sunrise\u2014or nature in general\u2014or when you read a book or watch a movie that you thoroughly enjoy. Get the taste of this feeling and contrast it with the first, namely, the one that was generated within you when you were praised. The first type of feeling comes from self-glorification and self-promotion. It is a worldly feeling. The second type comes from self-fulfillment, which is a soul feeling.","Once you\u2019ve done that, consider the true nature of worldly feelings, namely, the feelings of self-promotion and self-glorification. They are not natural; they were invented by your society and your culture to make you productive and controllable. Those feelings don\u2019t produce the nourishment and happiness that comes about from contemplating nature, enjoying the company of friends, or loving your work. They were meant to produce thrills, excitement\u2014and emptiness.","Take a look at the people around you. Is there a single person among them who hasn\u2019t become addicted to those worldly feelings? Is there a single person who is not controlled by them, hungering for them, spending every minute of their waking life consciously or unconsciously seeking them? When you see this, you will understand how people attempt to gain the world and, in the process, lose their soul. For they live empty, soulless lives.","The biggest enemy of love is attachments. Desire, in the sense of attachment. You know why? Because if I desire you, I want to possess you. I can\u2019t leave you free. I\u2019ve got to get you. I\u2019ve got to manipulate you so that I can get you, if I desire you in this way. I\u2019m going to manipulate myself, so that I can hoodwink you into allowing me to get you. Are you following what I\u2019m saying? Clear enough? There\u2019s no fear in perfect love. You know why? Because there\u2019s no desire.","And you will understand how true it is that everyone who stops clinging to brothers or sisters, father, mother or children, land or houses\xa0\u2026\xa0is repaid a hundred times over and gains eternal life.","Compare the serene and simple splendor of a rose in bloom with the tensions and restlessness of your life. The rose has a gift that you lack: It is perfectly content to be itself. It has not been programmed from birth, as you have been, to be dissatisfied with itself, so it doesn\u2019t have the slightest urge to be anything other than what it is. It possesses the artless grace and absence of inner conflict that among humans is only found in little children and mystics. Only the adult human being is able to be one thing and pretend to be another. Think of the sad history of your self-improvement efforts\u2014they either ended in disaster or they succeeded only at the cost of struggle and pain. You are always dissatisfied with yourself, always wanting to change yourself, always wanting more. So, you are full of violence and self-intolerance, which only grows with every effort that you make to change yourself. Thus, any change you achieve is inevitably accompanied by inner conflict. Now suppose you stopped all efforts to change yourself and ended all self-dissatisfaction. Would you then be doomed to go to sleep at night having passively accepted everything in you and around you? There is another choice besides laborious self-pushing, on the one hand, or stagnant acceptance, on the other. It is the way of self-understanding. It is far from easy because to understand what you are requires complete freedom from all desire to change what you are into something else.","If people want happiness so badly, why don\u2019t they attempt to understand their false beliefs? First, because it never occurs to them to see them as false or even as beliefs. They see them as facts and reality, so deeply have they been programmed. Second, because they are scared to lose the only world they know\u2014the world of desires, attachments, fears, social pressures, tensions, ambitions, worries, and guilt with occasional flashes of pleasure and relief and excitement. It\u2019s like someone that is afraid to let go of a nightmare because, after all, it is the only world he knows. There you have a picture of yourself and of other people.","Then say to this person, \u201cI have no right to make any demands on you. In saying that, you will drop your expectation. \u201cI have no right to make any demands on you. Oh, I\u2019ll protect myself from the consequences of your actions or your moods or whatever, but you can go right ahead and be what you choose to be. I have no right to make any demands on you.\u201d","attachment","Whatever a relationship may be, it certainly entails two things: clarity of perception (inasmuch as we\u2019re capable of it; some people would dispute to what extent we can attain clarity of perception, but I don\u2019t think anyone would dispute that it is desirable that we move toward it) and accuracy of response. You\u2019re more likely to respond accurately when you perceive clearly. When your perception is distorted, you\u2019re not likely to respond accurately. How can you love someone whom you do not even see? Do you really see someone you\u2019re attached to? Do you really see someone you\u2019re afraid of and therefore dislike? We always hate what we fear.","Profanity has been known to offer spiritual relief denied to prayer.","Contrary to what your culture and religion have taught you, nothing\u2014but absolutely nothing of the world\u2014can make you happy. The moment you see that, you will stop moving from one job to another, one friend or lover to another, one place, one spiritual technique, one guru to another. None of these things can give you a single minute of happiness. They can only offer you a temporary thrill, a pleasure, that initially grows in intensity then turns into pain if you lose them and boredom if you keep them.","God does not die on the day we cease to believe in a personal deity. But we die on the day when our lives cease to be illumined by the steady radiance of wonder renewed daily, the source of which is beyond all reason.","The first reaction is one of fear. It\u2019s not that we fear the unknown. You cannot fear something that you do not know. Nobody is afraid of the unknown. What you really fear is the loss of the known. That\u2019s what you fear.","But to depend on another psychologically \u2014 to depend on another emotionally \u2014 what does that imply? It means to depend on another human being for my happiness. Think about that. Because if you do, the next thing you will be doing, whether you\u2019re aware of it or not, is demanding that other people contribute to your happiness. Then there will be a next step \u2014 fear, fear of loss, fear of alienation, fear of rejection, mutual control. Perfect love casts out fear.Where there is love there are no demands, no expectations, no dependency. I do not demand that you make me happy; my happiness does not lie in you. If you were to leave me, I will not feel sorry for myself; I enjoy your company immensely, but I do not cling. Can you enjoy the relationship on a non-clinging basis, where what you really enjoy is not that person; it\u2019s something that\u2019s greater than both you and the other person.It is a kind of symphony, a kind of orchestra that plays one melody in one person\u2019s presence, but when he or she departs, the orchestra doesn\u2019t stop. When I meet someone else, it plays another melody, which is also very delightful. And when I\u2019m alone, it continues to play. There\u2019s a great repertoire and it never ceases to play.","attempt to understand the true nature of worldly feelings, namely, the feelings of self-promotion, self-glorification. They are not natural, they were invented by your society and your culture to make you productive and to make you controllable. These feelings do not produce the nourishment and happiness that is produced when one contemplates Nature or enjoys the company of one\u2019s friends or one\u2019s work. They were meant to produce thrills, excitement\u2014and emptiness.","How sad if we pass through life and never see it with the eyes of a child. This doesn\u2019t mean you should drop your concepts totally; they\u2019re very precious. Though we begin without them, concepts have a very positive function. Thanks to them we develop our intelligence. We\u2019re invited, not to become children, but to become like children. We do have to fall from a stage of innocence and be thrown out of paradise; we do have to develop an \u201cI and a \u201cme\u201d through these concepts. But then we need to return to paradise. We need to be redeemed again. We need to put off the old man, the old nature, the conditioned self, and return to the state of the child but without being a child. When we start off in life, we look at reality with wonder, but it isn\u2019t the intelligent wonder of the mystics; it\u2019s the formless wonder of the child. Then wonder dies and is replaced by boredom, as we develop language and words and concepts. Then hopefully, if we\u2019re lucky, we\u2019ll return to wonder again.\u201d","When you see this you will understand how people attempt to gain the world and, in the process, lose their soul.","These people don\u2019t bring delinquency with them; they become delinquent when they\u2019re faced with certain situations here.","Father, what you said to me was absolutely true but totally useless.\u2019","If there is anything I can do about the future, right now, I shall do it. Then I\u2019m going to just leave it alone and settle down to enjoy the present moment, because all the experience of my life has shown me that I can only cope with things when they are present, not before they occur. And that the present always gives me the resources and the energy I need to deal with them.","What is scripture, then? It\u2019s a hint, a clue, not a description. The fanaticism of one sincere believer who thinks he knows causes more evil than the united efforts of two hundred rogues. It\u2019s terrifying to see what sincere believers will do because they think they know.","We see people and things not as they are, but as we are. That is why when two people look at something or someone, you get two different reactions. We see things and people not as they are, but as we are.","Who decides what will finally make its way to your conscious mind from all the material that is pouring in from the world? Three decisive filters: first your attachments, second your beliefs and third your fears.","(Somebody said about most retreats that we begin them in the name of the Father and of the Son and of the Holy Spirit, and we end as it was in the beginning, is now, and ever shall be, world without end. Amen.)","The spiritual quest is a journey without distance. You travel from where you are right now to where you have always been. From ignorance to recognition, for all you do is see for the first time what you have always been looking at. Who ever heard of a path that brings you to yourself or a method that makes you what you have always been? Spirituality, after all, is only a matter of becoming what you really are.","So spend some time seeing each of the things you cling to for what it really is, a nightmare that causes you excitement and pleasure on the one hand but also worry, insecurity, tension, anxiety, fear, unhappiness on the other.","The highest knowledge of God is to know God as unknowable. There is far too much God talk; the world is sick of it. There is too little awareness, too little love, too little happiness, but let\u2019s not use those words either. There\u2019s too little dropping of illusions, dropping of errors, dropping of attachments and cruelty, too little awareness. That\u2019s what the world is suffering from, not from a lack of religion.","Your life as it is now: nightmare. Every single thing you cling to and have convinced yourself you cannot be happy without: nightmare.","All revelations, however divine, are never any more than a finger pointing to the moon. As we say in the East, \u201cWhen the sage points to the moon, all the idiot sees is the finger.","You are never in love with anyone. You\u2019re only in love with your prejudiced and hopeful idea of that person.","Charles de Foucauld,","The nature of rain is the same, but it makes thorns grow in the marshes and flowers in the gardens.","In order to be genuinely happy there is one and only one thing you need to do: get deprogrammed, get rid of those attachments.","Has it ever struck you that you have been programmed by society to be unhappy, and so, no matter what you do to become happy, you are bound to fail? Most people are so brainwashed that they do not even realize how unhappy they are. It\u2019s only when they make contact with joy that they understand how depressed they have been.","One of the biggest enemies to prayer is nervous tension.","In the past, regretting past mistakes, feeling guilty about past sins, gloating over past achievements, resenting past injuries caused them by other people.","Most people don\u2019t live aware lives. They live mechanical lives, mechanical thoughts\u2014generally somebody else\u2019s\u2014mechanical emotions, mechanical actions, mechanical reactions. As you begin to understand this, you stop making demands on yourself, you stop having expectations of yourself, you stop pushing yourself, and you begin to understand yourself.","Or in the future, dreading possible calamities and unpleasantnesses, anticipating future joys, dreaming of future events.","The moment you choose to become like someone else however great or holy, you have prostituted your being.","Stop for a moment and contemplate in horror the endless list of attachments that you have become a prisoner to. Think of concrete things and persons, not abstractions. Once your attachment had you in its grip, you began to strive with every waking minute of your life to rearrange the world around you so that you could attain and maintain the objects of your attachment.","No one can sin in the light of awareness. Sin occurs, not, as we mistakenly think, in malice, but in ignorance. \u201cFather, forgive them for they do not know what they are doing. To see this is to acquire the indiscriminate quality one so admires in the rose, the lamp and the tree.\u201d","And here is a second quality of love\u2014its gratuitousness.","For in the death of the ego is freedom, peace, serenity, joy.","Verdad necesitamos un coraz\xf3n que renuncie a todas sus \xabprogramaciones\xbb y a todo su ego\xedsmo; un coraz\xf3n que no tenga nada que proteger y nada que ambicionar; un coraz\xf3n, por tanto, libre y audaz.

It is rotten to the core, infected with attachments. What is an attachment? An attachment is an emotional state of clinging caused by the belief that without some particular thing or some person you cannot be happy.","la gente trata de ganar el mundo y c\xf3mo, al hacerlo, pierde su vida.

You give it as much power as you are using to fight it.","The symphony of life moves on but you keep looking back, clinging to a few bars of the melody, blocking your ears to the rest of the music,","If you aren\u2019t consciously aware, you\u2019re vulnerable to either being brainwashed or being influenced by forces within you that you have no awareness of at all.","Though everything is a mess, all is well. Strange paradox, to be sure. But, tragically, most people never get to see that all is well because they are asleep. They are having a nightmare.","Think of yourself in a concert hall listening to the strains of the sweetest music when you suddenly remember that you forgot to lock your car. You are anxious about the car, you cannot walk out of the hall and you cannot enjoy the music. There you have a perfect image of life as it is lived by most human beings.","The positive element is the flash of pleasure and excitement, the thrill that you experience when you get what you are attached to. The negative element is the sense of threat and tension that always accompanies the attachment. Think of someone gobbling up food in a concentration camp. With one hand, he brings the food to his mouth; with the other hand, he protects it from neighbors who will grab it from him the moment he lowers his guard. There you have the perfect image of the attached person. Do you have any attachments to people or things that you falsely believe you could not be happy without? Make a list of them right now. Spend some time seeing each thing you cling to for what it really is\u2014a nightmare that causes you excitement and pleasure on the one hand but also worry, insecurity, tension, anxiety, fear, and unhappiness on the other. Father and mother? Nightmare. Wife and children, brothers and sisters? Nightmare. All your possessions? Nightmare. Your life as it is now? Nightmare. Every single thing you cling to and have convinced yourself you cannot live without? Nightmare.","To acquire happiness you don\u2019t have to do anything, because happiness cannot be acquired. Does anybody know why? Because we have it already.","Life is easy, life is delightful. It\u2019s only hard on your illusions, your ambitions, your greed, your cravings.","An attachment, by its very nature, makes you vulnerable to emotional turmoil and is always threatening to shatter your peace.","Los hind\xfaes han creado una encantadora imagen para describir la relaci\xf3n entre Dios y su Creaci\xf3n. Dios \xabdanza\xbb su Creaci\xf3n. \xc9l es su bailar\xedn; su Creaci\xf3n es la danza. La danza es diferente del bailar\xedn; y, sin embargo, no tiene existencia posible con independencia de \xc9l. No es algo que pueda uno encerrar en una caja y lle v\xe1rselo a casa. En el momento en que el bailar\xedn se detiene, la danza deja de existir. En su b\xfasqueda de Dios, el hombre piensa demasiado, reflexiona demasiado, habla demasiado. Incluso cuando contempla esta danza que llamamos \xabCreaci\xf3n\xbb, est\xe1 todo el tiempo pensando, hablando (consigo mismo o con los dem\xe1s), reflexionando, analizando, filosofando. Palabras, palabras, palabras... Ruido, ruido, ruido... Guarda silencio y mira la danza. Sencillamente, mira: una estrella, una flor, una hoja marchita, un p\xe1jaro, una piedra... Cualquier fragmento de la danza sirve. Mira. Escucha. Huele. Toca.\xa0Saborea. Y seguramente no tardar\xe1s en verle a \xe9l, al Bailar\xedn en persona.","To come to the land of love, you must pass through the pains of death, for to love persons means to die to the need for persons and to be utterly alone.","Every child has a god in him. Our attempts to mold the child will turn the god into a devil. Children come to my school, little devils, hating the world, destructive, unmannerly, lying, thieving, bad-tempered. In six months they are happy, healthy children who do no evil.","So how can you expect an attached person to enter that ocean of happiness called the Kingdom of God? As well as you can expect a camel to pass through the eye of a needle! Anyone who stops clinging to brothers, sisters, father, mother, children, land, or houses is repaid a hundred times over and gains eternal life. Then you will so easily take leave of your possessions, that is, you will stop clinging, and you will have destroyed clinging\u2019s capacity to hurt you. Then, at last, you will experience that mysterious state that cannot be described or uttered\u2014the state of abiding happiness and peace.","Hardly anyone has been told the following truth: In order to be genuinely happy, there is one and only one thing you need to do\u2014get deprogrammed and get rid of those attachments. When people stumble upon this self-evident truth, they become terrified at the thought of the pain involved in dropping their attachments. But the process is not a painful one at all. On the contrary, getting rid of attachments is a perfectly delightful task, that is, if the instrument you use to rid yourself of them is not willpower or renunciation, but sight. All you need to do is open your eyes and see that you do not really need the object of your attachment at all\u2014that you were programmed, brainwashed into thinking that you could not be happy or you could not live without that particular person or thing.","An attachment is not a fact. It is a belief, a fantasy, in your head, acquired through programming. If that fantasy did not exist inside your head, you would not be attached. You would love things and people, and you would enjoy them thoroughly, but on a nonattachment basis. As a matter of fact, is there any other way to really enjoy something?"]')}}]);
