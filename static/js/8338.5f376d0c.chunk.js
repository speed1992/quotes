You will be a fool for the moment, but a wise man for the rest of your life.","It is not because things are difficult that we do not dare; it is because we do not dare that things are difficult","Religion is regarded by the common people as true, by the wise as false, and by rulers as useful.","True happiness is to enjoy the present, without anxious dependence upon the future, not to amuse ourselves with either hopes or fears but to rest satisfied with what we have, which is sufficient, for he that is so wants nothing. The greatest blessings of mankind are within us and within our reach. A wise man is content with his lot, whatever it may be, without wishing for what he has not.","Be wary of the man who urges an action in which he himself incurs no risk.","Retire into yourself as much as possible.

It abounds with pleasure if you know how to use it. The gradually declining years are among the sweetest in a man\'s life, and I maintain that, even when they have reached the extreme limit, they have their pleasure still.","Nature does not bestow virtue; to be good is an art.","Health is the soul that animates all the enjoyments of life, which fade and are tasteless without it.","We are always complaining that our days are few, and acting as though there would be no end to them.","The mind makes the nobleman, and uplifts the lowly to high degree.","Nothing is so wretched or foolish as to anticipate misfortunes.

Same as Cato when he was attacked; not fire up or revenge the insult., or even return the blow, but simply ignore it.","A consciousness of wrongdoing is the first step to salvation...you have to catch yourself doing it before you can correct it.","Live for thy neighbor if thou wouldst live for thyself.","Self-denial is the best riches.","He that does good to another does good also to himself, not only in the consequence but in the very act. For the consciousness of well-doing is in itself ample reward.","Most people fancy themselves innocent of those crimes of which they cannot be convicted.","The foremost art of Kings is the power to endure hatred.","They who have light in themselves will not revolve as satellites.","If thou wishest to get rid of thy evil propensities, thou must keep far from evil companions.","Obedience is yielded more readily to one who commands gently.","In war there is no prize for runner-up.","Not how long, but how well you have lived is the main thing.","It is the practice of the multitude to bark at eminent men, as little dogs do at strangers.","Vice may be learnt, even without a teacher","I am telling you to be a slow-speaking person.","The way to good conduct is never too late.","Leisure without study is death, and the grave of a living man.","Death is the wish of some, the relief of many, and the end of all.","Fortune\'s not content with knocking a man down; she sends him spinning head over heels, crash upon crash.","To see a man fearless in dangers, untainted with lusts, happy in adversity, composed in a tumult, and laughing at all those things which are generally either coveted or feared, all men must acknowledge that this can be from nothing else but a beam of divinity that influences a mortal body.","While we are postponing, life speeds by.","The mind is a matter over every kind of fortune; itself acts in both ways, being the cause of its own happiness and misery.","Shun no toil to make yourself remarkable by some talent or other.","The heart is great which shows moderation in the midst of prosperity.","Delay not; swift the flight of fortune\'s greatest favours.","Economy is in itself a great source of revenue.","Be harsh with yourself at times.","It is equally a fault to believe all men or to believe none.","That which has been endured with difficulty is remedied with delight.","If thou art a man, admire those who attempt great things, even though they fail.","A physician is not angry at the intemperance of a mad patient, nor does he take it ill to be railed at by a man in fever. Just so should a wise man treat all mankind, as a physician does his patient, and look upon them only as sick and extravagant.","Every guilty person is his own hangman.","He who does not want to die should not want to live. For life is tendered to us with the proviso of death.

Only by living thus, and not setting too high a value on things which can at any moment be taken away from him, can he discover that true, unshakeable peace and contentment to which ambition, luxury and above all avarice are among the greatest obstacles.","Our posterity will wonder about our ignorance of things so plain.","We live not according to reason, but according to fashion.","You want to live-but do you know how to live? You are scared of dying-and, tell me, is the kind of life you lead really any different from being dead?","The largest part of goodness is the will to become good.","I require myself not to be equal to the best, but to be better then the bad.","Nothing is more honorable than a grateful heart.","We should every night call ourselves to an account:  What infirmity have I mastered today?  What passions opposed?  What temptation resisted?  What virtue acquired?  Our vices will abate of themselves if they be brought every day to the shrift.","Nothing is ours except time.","To be able to endure odium is the first art to be learned by those who aspire to power.","We are taught for the schoolroom, not for life.","Let not the enjoyment of pleasures now within your grasp, be carried to such excess as to incapacitate you from future repetition.","If you would judge, understand.","For greed, all nature is too little.","Wisdom teaches us to do, as well as to talk; and to make our words and actions all of a colour.","A well-governed appetite is a great part of liberty","It is the power of the mind to be unconquerable.","For men in a state of freedom had thatch for their shelter, while slavery dwells beneath marble and gold.","Virtue depends partly upon training and partly upon practice; you must learn first, and then strengthen your learning by actions.","You have to persevere and fortify your pertinacity until the will to good becomes a disposition to good.","Small sorrows speak great ones are silent.","To the believers it is true.\\nTo the wise it is false.\\nTo the leaders it is useful.","There is nothing in the world so much admired as a man who knows how to bear unhappiness with courage.","Nothing is so contemptible as the sentiments of the mob.","Life\'s like a play; it\'s not the length, but the excellence of the acting that matters.","My advice is really this: what we hear the philosophers saying and what we find in their writings should be applied in our pursuit of the happy life. We should hunt out the helpful pieces of teaching and the spirited and noble-minded sayings which are capable of immediate practical application-not far far-fetched or archaic expressions or extravagant metaphors and figures of speech-and learn them so well that words become works.","To strive with an equal is dangerous; with a superior, mad; with an inferior, degrading.","So live with an inferior as you would wish a superior to live with you.","To err is human. To repeat error is of the Devil.","Success consecrates the most offensive crimes.","What difference does it make, after all, what your position in life is if you dislike it yourself?","The worst evil of all is to leave the ranks of the living before one dies.","Speech devoted to truth should be straightforward and plain","Believe me, that was a happy age, before the days of architects, before the days of builders.","Do the best you can . . . enjoy the present . . . rest satisfied with what you have.","Philosophy is the art and law of life, and it teaches us what to do in all cases, and, like good marksmen, to hit the white at any distance.","A favor is to a grateful man delightful always; to an ungrateful man only once.","He who is penitent is almost innocent.","My joy in learning is partly that it enables me to teach.","A man\'s ability cannot possibly be of one sort and his soul of another.

Nature planted in us a mutual love, and fitted us for a social life. We must consider that we were born for the good of the whole.","Watch over yourself. Be your own accuser, then your judge; ask yourself grace sometimes, and, if there is need, impose upon yourself some pain.","Courage leads to heaven; fear leads to death.","Remember, not one penny can we take with us into the unknown land.","A good character is the only guarantee of everlasting, carefree happiness.","Whenever you hold a fellow creature in distress, remember that he is a man.","Nobody becomes guilty by fate.","The state of that man\'s mind who feels too intense an interest as to future events, must be most deplorable.","That which we are not permitted to have we delight in; that which we can have is disregarded.","It is often better not to see an insult than to avenge it.","Death\'s the discharge of our debt of sorrow.","We are wrong in looking forward to death: in great measure it\'s past already.","The abundance of books is distraction","It is a rough road that leads to the heights of greatness.

The poor man is not one who has little, but one who hankers after more.","You cease to be afraid when you cease to hope; for hope is accompanied by fear.","It\'s unknown the place and uncertain the time where death awaits you; thus you must expect death to find you, every time, at every place.","You must linger among a limited number of master-thinkers, and digest their works, if you would derive ideas which shall win firm hold in your mind.","Fidelity bought with money is overcome by money.","There is no evil that does not promise inducements. Avarice promises money; luxury, a varied assortment of pleasures; ambition, a purple robe and applause. Vices tempt you by the rewards they offer.","The rust of the mind is the destruction of genius.","Virtue is shut out from no one; she is open to all, accepts all, invites all, gentlemen, freedmen, slaves, kings, and exiles; she selects neither house nor fortune; she is satisfied with a human being without adjuncts.","He who is everywhere is nowhere.","Most powerful is he who has himself in his own power.","Gold is tried by fire, brave men by adversity.","Hardly a man will you find who could live with his door open.","Voyage, travel, and change of place impart vigor","It is remarkable that Providence has given us all things for our advantage near at hand; but iron, gold, and silver, being both the instruments of blood and slaughter and the price of it, nature has hidden in the bowels of the earth.","There are no greater wretches in the world than many of those whom people in general take to be happy.","The philosopher: he alone knows how to live for himself.

The life we receive is not short but we make it so; we are not ill provided but use what we have wastefully.","Leisure without literature is death and burial alive.","There has never been any great genius without a spice of madness.","In the meantime, cling tooth and nail to the following rule: not to give in to adversity, not to trust prosperity, and always take full note of fortune\'s habit of behaving just as she pleases.","Levity of behavior is the bane of all that is good and virtuous.","The things that are essential are acquired with little bother; it is the luxuries that call for toil and effort.","The fates lead the willing, and drag the unwilling.","Let me therefore live as if every moment were to be my last.","Some laws, though unwritten, are more firmly established than all written laws.","On him does death lie heavily, who, but too well known to all, dies to himself unknown.","It is not how many books thou hast, but how good; careful reading profiteth, while that which is full of variety delighteth.","To lose a friend is the greatest of all evils, but endeavour rather to rejoice that you possessed him than to mourn his loss.","Greed\'s worst point is its ingratitude.","... frugality makes a poor man rich.","Fortune dreads the brave, and is only terrible to the coward.","Who-only let him be a man and intent upon honor-is not eager for the honorable ordeal and prompt to assume perilous duties? To what energetic man is not idleness a punishment?","No work is of such merit as to instruct from a mere cursory perusal.","What is more insane than to vent on senseless things the anger that is felt towards men?","The Germans, a race eager for war.","Nothing is more hateful to wisdom than to much cunning.","It is to the interest of the commonwealth of mankind that there should be someone who is unconquered, someone against whom fortune has no power.","Some lack the fickleness to live as they wish and just live as they have begun.","When thou hast profited so much that thou respectest even thyself, thou mayst let go thy tutor.","Death takes us piecemeal, not at a gulp.","The hour which gives us life begins to take it away.","A friend always loves, but he who loves is not always a friend.","I am like a book, with pages that have stuck together for want of use: my mind needs unpacking and the truths stored within must be turned over from time to time, to be ready when occasion demands.","Full of men, vacant of friends.","It is the mind that makes us rich and happy, in what condition soever we are, and money signifies no more to it than it does to the gods.","Remove severe restraint and what will become of virtue?","We most often go astray on a well trodden and much frequented road.","What does reason demand of a man? A very easy thing-to live in accord with his own nature.","The approach of liberty makes even an old man brave.","To make another person hold his tongue, be you first silent.","Many men provoke others to overreach them by excessive suspicion; their extraordinary distrust in some sort justifies the deceit.","Set aside a certain number of days, during which you shall be content with the scantiest and cheapest fare, with course and rough dress, saying to yourself the while: \\" Is this the condition that I feared?\\"","Every one has time if he likes. Business runs after nobody: people cling to it of their own free will and think that to be busy is a proof of happiness.","What nature requires is obtainable, and within easy reach. It is for the superfluous we sweat.","Those whom true love has held, it will go on holding.","Death: There\'s nothing bad about it at all except the thing that comes before it-the fear of it.","Shall I tell you what the real evil is? To cringe to the things that are called evils, to surrender to them our freedom, in defiance of which we ought to face any suffering.","I was shipwrecked before I got aboard.","Why will no man confess his faults? Because he continues to indulge in them; a man cannot tell his dream till he wakes.","Things that were hard to bear are sweet to remember.","Diligence is a very great help even to a mediocre intelligence. -Diligentia maximum etiam mediocris ingeni subsidium","What is true belongs to me!","The man who has learned to triumph over sorrow wears his miseries as though they were sacred fillets upon his brow; and nothing is so entirely admirable as a man bravely wretched.","Such is the blindness, nay the insanity of mankind, that some men are driven to death by the fear of it.","The wise man lacked nothing but needed a great number of things, whereas the fool, on the other hand, needs nothing (for he does not know how to use anything) but lacks everything.","Constant exposure to dangers will breed contempt for them.","To things which you bear with impatience you should accustom yourself, and, by habit you will bear them well.","I will govern my life and thoughts as if the whole world were to see the one and read the other, for what does it signify to make anything a secret to my neighbor, when to God, who is the searcher of our hearts, all our privacies are open?","Money does all things for reward. Some are pious and honest as long as they thrive upon it, but if the devil himself gives better wages, they soon change their party.","Freedom can\'t be bought for nothing. If you hold her precious, you must hold all else of little worth.","He who boasts of his descent, praises the deed of another.","Tis a human trait to hate one you have wronged","A great mind becomes a great fortune.","Friendship always benefits; love sometimes injures.","Be not too hasty either with praise or blame; speak always as though you were giving evidence before the judgement-seat of the Gods.","Calamity is virtue\'s opportunity.","There are more people abusive to others than lie open to abuse themselves; but the humor goes round, and he that laughs at me today will have somebody to laugh at him tomorrow.","Anger is like those ruins which smash themselves on what they fall.","Speech is the index of the mind.","We are mad, not only individually, but nationally. We check manslaughter and isolated murders; but what of war and the much-vaunted crime of slaughtering whole peoples?","We should conduct ourselves not as if we ought to live for the body, but as if we could not live without it.","No evil is without its compensation.","With parsimony a little is sufficient; without it nothing is sufficient; but frugality makes a poor man rich.","Let wickedness escape as it may at the bar, it never fails of doing justice upon itself; for every guilty person is his own hangman.","The willing, destiny guides them; the unwilling, destiny drags them.","No possession is gratifying without a companion.","He robs present ills of their power who has perceived their coming beforehand.","Time is the one thing that is given to everyone in equal measure.","Do you desire not to be angry? Be not inquisitive. He who inquires what is said of him only works out his own misery.","There is a noble manner of being poor, and who does not know it will never be rich.","If wisdom were offered me with the proviso that I should keep it shut up and refrain from declaring it, I should refuse. There\'s no delight in owning anything unshared.","Precepts or maxims are of great weight; and a few useful ones at hand do more toward a happy life than whole volumes that we know not where to find.","Anyone can stop a man\'s life, but no one his death; a thousand doors open on to it.","If true, the Pythagorean principles as to abstain from flesh, foster innocence; if ill-founded they at least teach us frugality, and what loss have you in losing your cruelty? It merely deprives you of the food of lions and vultures...let us ask what is best - not what is customary. Let us love temperance - let us be just - let us refrain from bloodshed.","It was the saying of a great man, that if we could trace our descents, we should find all slaves to come from princes, and all princes from slaves; and fortune has turned all things topsy-turvy in a long series of revolutions; beside, for a man to spend his life in pursuit of a title, that serves only when he dies to furnish out an epitaph, is below a wise man\'s business.","The tempest threatens before it comes; houses creak before they fall.","You should rather suppose that those are involved in worthwhile duties who wish to have daily as their closest friends Zeno, Pythagoras, Democritus and all the other high priests of liberal studies, and Aristotle and Theophrastus. None of these will be too busy to see you, none of these will not send his visitor away happier and more devoted to himself, none of these will allow anyone to depart empty-handed. They are at home to all mortals by night and by day.","An unpopular rule is never long maintained.","It is one thing to remember, another to know.  To remember is to safeguard something entrusted to the memory.  But to know is to make each thing one\'s own, not depend on the text and always to look back to the teacher.  \\"Zeno said this, Cleanthes said this.\\"  Let there be space between you and the book.","Why do I not seek some real good; one which I could feel, not one which I could display?","The mind is never right but when it is at peace within itself.","War I abhor, and yet how sweet The sound along the marching street Of drum and fife, and I forget Wet eyes of widows, and forget Broken old mothers, and the whole Dark butchery without a soul.","We ought to take outdoor walks, to refresh and raise our spirits by deep breathing in the open air.","It is the fault of youth that it cannot restrain its own impetuosity.","No evil is without its compensation. The less money, the less trouble; the less favor, the less envy. Even in those cases which put us out of wits, it is not the loss itself, but the estimate of the loss that troubles us.","What difference does it make how much you have? What you do not have amounts to much more.","Other men\'s sins are before our eyes; our own are behind our backs.","Philosophy alone makes the mind invincible, and places us out of the reach of fortune, so that all her arrows fall short of us.","Pleasure dies at the very moment when it charms us most.","Reasons for anxiety will never be lacking, whether born of prosperity or of wretchedness; life pushes on in a succession of engrossments. We shall always pray for leisure.","I am ashamed of my master and not of my servitude.","True friends are the whole world to one another; and he that is a friend to himself is also a friend to mankind. Even in my studies the greatest delight I take is of imparting it to others; for there is no relish to me in the possessing of anything without a partner.","All things are cause for either laughter or weeping.","Disease is not of the body but of the place.","Philosophy is good advice, and no one gives good advice at the top of his lungs.","What progress have I made? I am beginning to be my own friend. That is progress indeed","Freedom is not being a slave to any circumstance, to any constraint, to any chance; it means compelling Fortune to enter the lists on equal terms.","No one can be happy who has been thrust outside the pale of truth. And there are two ways that one can be removed from this realm: by lying, or by being lied to.","A man who examines the saddle and bridle and not the animal itself when he is out to buy a horse is a fool; similarly, only an absolute fool values a man according to his clothes, or according to his position, which after all is only something we wear like clothing.","What need is there to weep over parts of life? The whole of it calls for tears.","When modesty has once perished, it will never revive.","Crime when it succeeds is called virtue.","One who\'s our friend is fond of us; one who\'s fond of us isn\'t necessarily our friend.","A great step toward independence is a good-humoured stomach.","It is a world of mischief that may be done by a single example of avarice or luxury. One voluptuous palate makes many more.","The body is not a permanent dwelling, but a sort of inn which is to be left behind when one perceives that one is a burden to the host.","Let ease and rest at times be given to the weary.","The soul has this proof of divinity: that divine things delight it.","True joy is a serene and sober motion; and they are miserably out so that take laughing for rejoicing; the seat of it is within, and there is no cheerfulness like the resolutions of a brave mind.","Golden roofs break men\'s rest.","Dead, we become the lumber of the world, And to that mass of matter shall be swept Where things destroyed with things unborn are kept.","An action will not be right unless the will be right; for from thence is the action derived. Again, the will will not be right unless the disposition of the mind be right; for from thence comes the will.","No one can have all he desires.","It goes far toward making a man faithful to let him understand that you think him so; and he that does but suspect I will deceive him, gives me a sort of right to do so.","The greatest wealth is a poverty of desires.","Freedom can\'t be kept for nothing. If you set a high value on liberty, you must set a low value on everything else.","Whatsoever has exceeded its proper limit is in an unstable position.","People pay the doctor for his trouble; for his kindness they still remain in his debt.","These individulas have riches just as we say that we \'have a fever,\' when really the fever has us.","What must be shall be; and that which is a necessity to him that struggles, is little more than choice to him that is willing.","What others think of us would be of little moment did it not, when known, so deeply tinge what we think of ourselves.","No man esteems anything that comes to him by chance; but when it is governed by reason, it brings credit both to the giver and receiver; whereas those favors are in some sort scandalous that make a man ashamed of his patron.","What else is nature but God?","Time discovers truth.","Whatever fortune has raised to a height, she has raised only to cast it down.","The condition of all who are preoccupied is wretched, but most wretched is the condition of those who labor at preoccupations that are not even their own, who regulate their sleep by that of another, their walk by the pace of another, who are under orders in case of the freest things in the world-loving and hating. If these wish to know how short their life is, let them reflect how small a part of it is their own.","Cato, being scurrilously treated by a low and vicious fellow, quietly said to him, \\"A contest between us is very unequal, for thou canst bear ill language with ease, and return it with pleasure; but to me it is unusual to hear, and disagreeable to speak it.\\" There are none more abusive to others than they that lie most open to it themselves; but the humor goes round, and he that laughs at me today will have somebody to laugh at him tomorrow.","Behold a worthy sight, to which the God, turning his attention to his own work, may direct his gaze. Behold an equal thing, worthy of a God, a brave man matched in conflict with evil fortune.","In every good man a God doth dwell.","Nothing, to my way of thinking, is a better proof of a well-ordered mind than a man\'s ability to stop just where he is and pass some time in his own company.","Beauty is such a fleeting blossom, how can wisdom rely upon its momentary delight?","Chance makes a plaything of a man\'s life.","Ignorant people see life as either existence or non-existence, but wise men see it beyond both existence and non-existence to something that transcends them both; this is an observation of the Middle Way.","You need a change of soul rather than a change of climate.","You must live for another if you wish to live for yourself.","So called pleasures, when they go beyond a certain limit, are but punishments.","As long as we are among humans, let us be humane.","But when you are looking on anyone as a friend when you do not trust him as you trust yourself, you are making a grave mistake, and have failed to grasp sufficiently the full force of true friendship.","Enjoy present pleasures in such a way as not to injure future ones.","We pray for trifles without so much as a thought of the greatest blessings; and we are not ashamed many times, to ask God for that which we should blush to own to our neighbor.","There is nothing that Nature has made necessary which is more easy than death; we are longer a-coming into the world than going out of it; and there is not any minute of our lives wherein we may not reasonably expect it. Nay, it is but a momen\'ts work, the parting of soul and body. What a shame is it then to stand in fear of anything so long that is over so soon!","As fate is inexorable, and not to be moved either with tears or reproaches, an excess of sorrow is as foolish as profuse laughter; while, on the other hand, not to mourn at all is insensibility.","We are all sinful. Therefore whatever we blame in another we shall find in our own bosoms.","It is opportunity that makes the thief.","Whatever begins, also ends.","A great, a good, and a right mind is a kind of divinity lodged in flesh, and may be the blessing of a slave as well as of a prince: it came from heaven, and to heaven it must return; and it is a kind of heavenly felicity, which a pure and virtuous mind enjoys, in some degree, even upon earth.","Men trust rather to their eyes than to their ears; the effect of precepts is therefore slow and tedious, whilst that of examples is summary and effectual.","He is greedy of life who is not willing to die when the world is perishing around him.","Know thyself; this is the great object.","Solitude and company may be allowed to take their turns: the one creates in us the love of mankind, the other that of ourselves; solitude relieves us when we are sick of company, and conversation when we are weary of being alone, so that the one cures the other. There is no man so miserable as he that is at a loss how to use his time","It is the property of a great and good mind to covet, not the fruit of good deeds, but good deeds themselves, and to seek for a good man even after having met with bad men.","The articulate, trained voice is more distracting than mere noise.","The mind that is anxious about future events is miserable.","God has not revealed all things to man and has entrusted us with but a fragment of His mighty work. But He who directs all things, who has established and laid the foundation of the world, who has clothed Himself with Creation, He is greater and better than that which He has wrought. Hidden from our eyes, He can only be reached by the spirit.","Great is he who enjoys his earthenware as if it were plate, and not less great is the man to whom all his plate is no more that earthenware.","He that visits the sick in hopes of a legacy, but is never so friendly in all other cases, I look upon him as being no better than a raven that watches a weak sheep only to peck out its eyes.","The mind is never right but when it is at peace within itself; the soul is in heaven even while it is in the flesh, if it be purged of its natural corruptions, and taken up with divine thoughts, and contemplations.","It is easier to exclude harmful passions than to rule them, and to deny them admittance than to control them after they have been admitted.","Nothing is void of God, his work is everywhere his full of himself.","We are so vain as to set the highest value upon those things to which nature has assigned the lowest place. What can be more coarse and rude in the mind than the precious metals, or more slavish and dirty than the people that dig and work them? And yet they defile our minds more than our bodies, and make the possessor fouler than the artificer of them. Rich men, in fine, are only the greater slaves.","Human affairs are like a chess-game: only those who do not take it seriously can be called good players. Life is like an earthen pot: only when it is shattered, does it manifest its emptiness.","Only a great man, believe me, and one whose excellence rises far above human failings, will not allow anything to be stolen from his own span of time, and his life is very long precisely because he has devoted to himself entirely any time that became available. None of it lay uncultivated and idle, none was under another man\'s control, for guarding it most jealously, he found nothing worth exchanging for his own precious time.","It is the failing of youth not to be able to restrain its own violence.","There is as much greatness of mind in acknowledging a good turn, as in doing it.","Why do people not confess vices? It is because they have not yet laid them aside. It is a waking person only who can tell their dreams.","That which achieves its effect by accident is not art.","The kind of solace that arises from having company in misery is spiteful.","We learn not for life but for the debating-room.","The best way to do good to ourselves is to do it to others; the right way to gather is to scatter.","The things which we hold in our hands, which we see with our eyes, and which our avarice hugs, are transitory, they may be taken from us by ill luck or by violence; but a kindness lasts even after the loss of that by means of which it was bestowed; for it is a good deed, which no violence can undo.","The entire world would perish, if pity were not to limit anger.","Humanity is fortunate, because no man is unhappy except by his own fault.","Revenge is an inhuman word.","Truth never perishes.","The point is, not how long you live, but how nobly you live.","The chief bond of the soldier is his oath of allegiance and love for the flag.","What was hard to suffer is sweet to remember.","To be everywhere is to be nowhere.","Retirement without the love of letters is a living burial.","Misfortunes, in fine, cannot be avoided; but they may be sweetened, if not overcome, and our lives made happy by philosophy.","The customs of that most criminal nation (Israel) have gained such strength that they have now been received in all lands. The conquered have given laws to the conquerors.","The sovereign good of man is a mind that subjects all things to itself and is itself subject to nothing; such a man\'s pleasures are modest and reserved, and it may be a question whether he goes to heaven, or heaven comes to him; for a good man is influenced by God Himself, and has a kind of divinity within him.","If I only have the will to be grateful, I am so.","What you do for an ungrateful man is thrown away.","It is rash to condemn where you are ignorant.","The key to getting everything you want is to never put all your begs in one ask-it!","Behold a contest worthy of a god, a brave man matched in conflict with adversity.","Economy is too late when you are at the bottom of your purse.","A hungry people listens not to reason, not cares for justice, nor is bent by any prayers.","Modesty forbids what the law does not.","It\'s not that we have a short time to live, but that we waste a lot of it.","I had rather never receive a kindness than never bestow one.","He who forbids not sin when he may, commands it","The guilt of enforced crimes lies on those who impose them.","The expression of truth is simplicity.","He who repents of having sinned is almost innocent.","Life\'s neither a good nor an evil: it\'s a field for good and evil.","He worships God who knows him.","How much does great prosperity overspread the mind with darkness.","What narrow innocence it is for one to be good only according to the law.","Some pretend want of power to make a competent return; and you shall find in others a kind of graceless modesty, that makes a man ashamed of requiting an obligation, because it is a confession that he has received one.","Precepts are the rules by which we ought to square our lives. When they are contracted into sentences, they strike the affections; whereas admonition is only blowing of the coal.","When once ambition has passed its natural limits, its progress is boundless.","I will have a care of being a slave to myself, for it is a perpetual, a shameful, and the heaviest of all servitudes; and this may be done by moderate desires.","Virtue with some is nothing but successful temerity.","Do what you should, not what you may.","It is a proof of nobility of mind to despise injuries.","Simple is the language of truth.","To make a commencement requires a mental effort.","Indolence is stagnation; employment is life.","We should live as if we were in public view, and think, too, as if someone could peer into the inmost recesses of our hearts-which someone can!","If you are bent on assuming a pose and never reveal yourself to anyone frankly, in the fashion of many who live a false life that is all made up for show; for it is torturous to be constantly watching oneself and be fearful of being caught out of our usual role. And we are never free from concern if we think that every time anyone looks at us he is always taking-our measure; for many things happen that strip off our pretence against our will, and, though all this attention to self is successful, yet the life of those who live under a mask cannot be happy and without anxiety.","When you enter a grove peopled with ancient trees, higher than the ordinary, and shutting out the sky with their thickly inter-twined branches, do not the stately shadows of the wood, the stillness of the place, and the awful gloom of this doomed cavern then strike you with the presence of a deity?","Teach the art of living well.","There are many things akin to highest deity that are still obscure. Some may be too subtle for our powers of comprehension, others imperceptible to us because such exalted majesty conceals itself in the holiest part of its sanctuary, forbidding access to any power save that of the spirit. How many heavenly bodies revolve unseen by human eye!","The evil which assails us is not in the localities we inhabit but in ourselves. We lack strength to endure the least task, being incapable of suffering pain, powerless to enjoy pleasure, impatient with everything. How many invoke death when, after having tried every sort of change, they find themselves reverting to the same sensations, unable to discover any new experience.","The physician cannot prescribe by letter, he must feel the pulse.","Love of action is not industry.","He who blushes at riding in a rattletrap, will boast when he rides in style.","Desultory reading is delightful, but to be beneficial, our reading must be carefully directed.","Adversity finds at last the man whom she has often passed by.","Anger, though concealed, is betrayed by the countenance. ?That anger is not warrantable which hath seen two suns.","Not to feel one\'s misfortunes is not human, not to bear them is not manly.","Our care should not be to have lived long as to have lived enough.","A crowd of fellow-sufferers is a miserable kind of comfort.","It\u2019s in the very trickery that it pleases me. But show me how the trick is done, and I have lost my interest therein.","Certain laws have not been written, but they are more fixed than all the written laws.","This is the law of benefits between men; the one ought to forget at once what was given, and the other ought never to forget what he has received.","No one\'s so old that he mayn\'t with decency hope for one more day.","A dwarf is small even if he stands on a mountain; a colossus keeps his height, even if he stands in a well.","How great would be our peril if our slaves began to number us!","Let him who has granted a favour speak not of it; let him who has received one, proclaim it.","Men love their vices and hate them at the same time.","You will die not because you\'re ill, but because you\'re alive.","Many discoveries are reserved for ages still to come . . . . Our universe is a sorry little affair unless it has in it something for every age to investigate.","Most men ebb and flow in wretchedness between the fear of death and the hardship of life; they are unwilling to live, and yet they do not know how to die.","What madness it is for a man to starve himself to enrich his heir, and so turn a friend into an enemy! For his joy at your death will be proportioned to what you leave him.","If sensuality were happiness, beasts were happier than men; but human felicity is lodged in the soul, not in the flesh.","In my own time there have been inventions of this sort, transparent windows tubes for diffusing warmth equally through all parts of a building short-hand, which has been carried to such a perfection that a writer can keep pace with the most rapid speaker. But the inventing of such things is drudgery for the lowest slaves; philosophy lies deeper. It is not her office to teach men how to use their hands. The object of her lessons is to form the soul.","A king is he who has laid fear aside and the base longings of an evil heart; whom ambition unrestrained and the fickle favor of the reckless mob move not.","Such as the chain of causes we call Fate, such is the chain of wishes: one links on to another; the whole man is bound in the chain of wishing for ever.","Nothing costs so much as what is bought by prayers.","In whatever direction you turn, you will see God coming to meet you; nothing is void of him, he himself fills all his work.","To expel hunger and thirst there is no necessity of sitting in a palace and submitting to the supercilious brow and contumelious favour of the rich and great there is no necessity of sailing upon the deep or of following the camp What nature wants is every where to be found and attainable without much difficulty whereas require the sweat of the brow for these we are obliged to dress anew j compelled to grow old in the field and driven to foreign mores A sufficiency is always at hand","A single lifetime, even though entirely devoted to the sky, would not be enough for the study of so vast a subject. A time will come when our descendants will be amazed that we did not know things that are so plain to them.","How much better to pursue a straight course and eventually reach that destination where the things that are pleasant are the things that are honorable finally become, for you, the same.","It is sometimes pleasant even to act like a madman.","Not a soul takes thought how well he may live- only how long: yet a good life might be everybody\'s, a long one can be nobody\'s.","A hated government does not long survive.","It is well to be born either a king or a fool.","Go on and increase in valor, O boy! this is the path to immortality.","If virtue precede us every step will be safe.","The wise man will not pardon any crime that ought to be punished, but he will accomplish, in a nobler way, all that is sought in pardoning. He will spare some and watch over some, because of their youth, and others on account of their ignorance. His clemency will not fall short of justice, but will fulfill it perfectly.","Nothing is more disgraceful than that an old man should have nothing to show to prove that he has lived long, except his years.","We have not to talk, but to steer the vessel.","...the geometrician teaches me how to work out the size of my estates rather than how to work out how much a man needs in order to have enough....You geometers can calculate the area of circles, can reduce any given shape to a square, can state the distances separating starts. Nothing\'s outside your scope when it comes to measurement. Well, if you\'re such an expert, measure a man\'s soul; tell me how large or how small that is. You can define a straight line; what use is that to you if you\'ve no idea what straightness means in life?","Fidelity purchased with money, money can destroy.","Whenever the speech is corrupted so is the mind.","The first and greatest punishment of the sinner is the conscience of sin.","If we desire to judge justly, we must persuade ourselves that none of us is without sin.","Let tears flow of their own accord; their flowing is not inconsistent with inward peace and harmony.","I am not born from a single place. My country is the whole world.","Consult your friend on all things, especially on those which respect yourself. His counsel may then be useful where your own self-love might impair your judgment.","Human nature is so constituted that insults sink deeper than kindnesses; the remembrance of the latter soon passes away, while that of the former is treasured in the memory.","Man\'s ideal state is realized when he has fulfilled the purpose for which he is born. And what is it that reason demands of him? Something very easy-that he live in accordance with his own nature.","Fortune may rob us of our wealth, not of our courage.","On entering a temple we assume all signs of reverence. How much more reverent then should we be before the heavenly bodies, the stars, the very nature of God!","Unfamiliarity lends weight to misfortune, and there was never a man whose grief was not heightened by surprise.","Nature does not reveal all her secrets at once. We imagine we are initiated in her mysteries: we are, as yet, but hanging around her outer courts.","Those that are a friend to themselves are sure to be a friend to all.","Those who pass their lives in foreign travel find they contract many ties of hospitality, but form no friendships.","Nature has given us the seeds of knowledge, not knowledge itself.","Now we are not merely to stick knowledge on to the soul: we must incorporate it into her; the soul should not be sprinkled with knowledge but steeped in it.","What is required is not a lot words, but effectual ones.","We never reflect how pleasant it is to ask for nothing.","As many servants so many enemies.","The stomach begs and clamors, and listens to no precepts. And yet it is not an obdurate creditor; for it is dismissed with small payment if you give it only what you owe, and not as much as you can.","There\'s one blessing only, the source and cornerstone of beatitude: confidence in self.","This body is not a home, but an inn; and that only for a short time.","Elegance is not an ornament worthy of man.","Four things does a reckless man gain who covets his neighbor\'s wife - demerit, an uncomfortable bed, thirdly, punishment, and lastly, hell.","The real compensation of a right action is inherent in having performed it.","Mercy often inflicts death.","There exists no more difficult art than living.","However wretched a fellow-mortal may be, he is still a member of our common species.","The best ideas are common property.","Those alone are wise who know how to love.","People do not die - they kill themselves.","Shall I tell you what philosophy holds out to humanity? Counsel...You are called in to help the unhappy.","The evil which assails us is not in the localities we inhabit but in ourselves.","Death is sometimes a punishment, often a gift; to many it has been a favor.","That which takes effect by chance is not an art.","Those whom fortune has never favored are more joyful than those whom she has deserted.","Necessity is stronger than duty.","The highest duty and the highest proof of wisdom - that deed and word should be in accord.","Laws do not persuade just because they threaten.","Let no man give advice to others that he has not first given himself.","Do not grudge your brother his rest. He has at last become free, safe and immortal, and ranges joyous through the boundless heavens; he has left this low-lying region and has soared upwards to that place which receives in its happy bosom the souls set free from the chains of matter. Your brother has not lost the light of day, but has obtained a more enduring light.

And we are never free from concern if we think that every time anyone looks at us he is always taking-our measure; for many things happen that strip off our pretence against our will, and, though all this attention to self is successful, yet the life of those who live under a mask cannot be happy and without anxiety. But how much pleasure there is in simplicity that is pure, in itself unadorned, and veils no part of its character!{PlainDealer+} Yet even such a life as this does run some risk of scorn, if everything lies open to everybody; for there are those who disdain whatever has become too familiar.

It is the example of other people that is our undoing; let us merely separate ourselves from the crowd, and we shall be made whole. But as it is, the populace,, defending its own iniquity, pits itself against reason. And so we see the same thing happening that happens at the elections, where, when the fickle breeze of popular favour has shifted, the very same persons who chose the praetors wonder that those praetors were chosen.","Wild animals run from the dangers they actually see, and once they have escaped them worry no more. We however are tormented alike by what is past and what is to come. A number of our blessings do us harm, for memory brings back the agony of fear while foresight brings it on prematurely.

We are all held in the same captivity, and those who have bound others are themselves in bonds - unless you think perhaps that the left-hand chain is lighter. One man is bound by high office, another by wealth; good birth weighs down some, and a humble origin others; some bow under the rule of other men and some under their own; some are restricted to one place by exile, others by priesthoods: all life is a servitude.So you have to get used to your circumstances, complain about them as little as possible, and grasp whatever advantage they have to offer: no condition is so bitter that a stable mind cannot find some consolation in it.","Can you no longer see a road to freedom?

We should hunt out the helpful pieces of teaching, and the spirited and noble-minded sayings which are capable of immediate practical application\u2014not far-fetched or archaic expressions or extravagant metaphors and figures of speech\u2014and learn them so well that words become works. No one to my mind lets humanity down quite so much as those who study philosophy as if it were a sort of commercial skill and then proceed to live in a quite different manner from the way they tell other people to live.","All this hurrying from place to place won\u2019t bring you any relief, for you\u2019re traveling in the company of your own emotions, followed by your troubles all the way.","Remember that all we have is \u201con loan from Fortune, which can reclaim it without our permission\u2014indeed, without even advance notice.

And so require not from me that I should be equal to the best, but that I should be better than the wicked. It is enough for me if every day I reduce the number of my vices, and blame my mistakes.","Hurry up and live.","Conversation has a kind of charm about it, an insinuating and insidious something that elicits secrets just like love or liquor.","You ask what is the proper limit to a person\'s wealth? First, having what is essential, and second, having what is enough.","Everywhere means nowhere. When a person spends all his time in foreign travel, he ends by having many acquaintances, but no friends. And the same thing must hold true of men who seek intimate acquaintance with no single author, but visit them all in a hasty and hurried manner. 3. Food does no good and is not assimilated into the body if it leaves the stomach as soon as it is eaten; nothing hinders a cure so much as frequent change of medicine; no wound will heal when one salve is tried after another; a plant which is often moved can never grow strong. There is nothing so efficacious that it can be helpful while it is being shifted about. And in reading of many books is distraction.","Men whose spirit has grown arrogant from the great favor of fortune have this most serious fault\u2014those whom they have injured they also hate.","When a mind is impressionable and has none too firm a hold on what is right, it must be rescued from the crowd: it is so easy for it to go over to the majority.","Sometimes, even to live is an act of courage.","Religion is regarded by the ignorant as true, by the wise as false, and by the rulers as useful.","the more a mind takes in the more it expands.","All things that are still to come lie in uncertainty; live straightway!","At times we ought to drink even to intoxication, not so as to drown, but merely to dip ourselves in wine, for wine washes away troubles and dislodges them from the depths of the mind and acts as a remedy to sorrow as it does to some diseases. The inventor of wine is called Liber, not from the license which he gives to our tongues but because he liberates the mind from the bondage of cares and emancipates it, animates it and renders it more daring in all that it attempts.","Quis hic locus, quae regio, quae mundi plaga? ubi sum? sub ortu solis, an sub cardine glacialis ursae?\\" \\"What place is this, what region, what quarter of the world? Where am I? Under the rising of the sun or beneath the wheeling course of the frozen bear?Hercules Furens (The Mad Hercules), Act 5, line 1138\u201d","Ab honesto virum bonum nihil deterret. (Nothing deters a good man from doing what is honorable.)-A Wrinkle in Time","Words need to be sown like seeds. No matter how tiny a seed may be, when in lands in the right sort of ground it unfolds its strength and from being minute expands and grows to a massive size.","O how many noble deeds of women are lost in obscurity!","Just as with storytelling, so with life: it\'s important how well it is done, not how long.","Otium sine litteris mors est et hominis vivi sepultura","When a man does not know what harbor he is making for, no wind is the right wind.","How many are quite unworthy to see the light, and yet the day dawns.","Believe me, it is the sign of a great man, and one who is above human error, not to allow his time to be frittered away: he has the longest possible life simply because whatever time was available he devoted entirely to himself.","So let those people go on weeping and wailing whose self-indulgent minds have been weakened by long prosperity, let them collapse at the threat of the most trivial injuries; but let those who have spent all their years suffering disasters endure the worst afflictions with a brave and resolute staunchness. Everlasting misfortune does have one blessing, that it ends up by toughening those whom it constantly afflicts.","People are delighted to accept pensions and gratuities, for which they hire out their labour or their support or their services. But nobody works out the value of time: men use it lavishly as if it cost nothing. But if death threatens these same people, you will see them praying to their doctors; if they are in fear of capital punishment, you will see them prepared to spend their all to stay alive.","So it is: we are not given a short life but we make it short, and we are not Ill-supplied but wasteful of it.","It\'s not years nor days, but the mind, that determines that we\'ve lived enough.","Here is your great soul\u2014the man who has given himself over to Fate; on the other hand, that man is a weakling and a degenerate who struggles and maligns the order of the universe and would rather reform the gods than reform himself.","A physician is not angry at the intemperance of a mad patient; nor does he take it ill to be railed at by a man in a fever. Just so should a wise man treat all mankind, as a physician does his patient; and looking upon them only as sick and extravagant.","To expect punishment is to suffer it; and to earn it is to expect it.","A guilty person sometimes has the luck to escape detection, but never to feel sure of it.","Injustice never rules forever","Life is slavery if the courage to die is absent.","You must set your hands to tasks which you can finish or at least hope to finish, and avoid those which get bigger as you proceed and do not cease where you had intended.","No matter how many men you kill, you can\'t kill your successor.","Most men ebb and flow in wretchedness between the fear of death and the hardships of life; they are unwilling to live, and yet they do not know how to die.","Envy of other people shows how they are unhappy. Their continual attention to others behavior shows how they are boring.","Reason shows us there is nothing either good or bad but thinking makes it so.","The geat blessing of mankind are within us and within our reach; but we shut our eyes, and like people in the dark, we fall foul upon the very thing we search for, without finding it.","Preserve a sense of proportion in your attitude to everything that pleases you, and make the most of them while they are at their best.","No man can be sane who searches for what will injure him in place of what is best.","If you apply yourself to study you will avoid all boredom with life, you will not long for night because you are sick of daylight, you will be neither a burden to yourself nor useless to others, you will attract many to become your friends and the finest people will flock about you.","All the greatest blessings are a source of anxiety, and at no time should fortune be less trusted than when it is best; to maintain prosperity there is need of other prosperity, and in behalf of the prayers that have turned out well we must make still other prayers. For everything that comes to us from chance is unstable, and the higher it rises, the more liable it is to fall. Moreover, what is doomed to perish brings pleasure to no one; very wretched, therefore, and not merely short, must the life of those be who work hard to gain what they must work harder to keep. By great toil they attain what they wish, and with anxiety hold what they have attained; meanwhile they take no account of time that will never more return.","Life will follow the path it started upon, and will neither reverse nor check its course; it will make no noise, it will not remind you of its swiftness. Silent it will glide on; it will not prolong itself at the command of a king, or at the applause of the populace. Just as it was started on its first day, so it will run; nowhere will it turn aside, nowhere will it delay.","Count your years and you\'ll be ashamed to be wanting and working for exactly the same things as you wanted when you were a boy. Of this one thing make sure against your dying day - that your faults die before you do. Have done with those unsettled pleasures, which cost one dear - they do one harm after they\'re past and gone, not merely when they\'re in prospect. Even when they\'re over, pleasures of a depraved nature are apt to carry feelings of dissatisfaction, in the same way as a criminal\'s anxiety doesn\'t end with the commission of the crime, even if it\'s undetected at the time. Such pleasures are insubstantial and unreliable; even if they don\'t do one any harm, they\'re fleeting in character. Look around for some enduring good instead. And nothing answers this description except what the spirit discovers for itself within itself. A good character is the only guarantee of everlasting, carefree happiness. Even if some obstacle to this comes on the scene, its appearance is only to be compared to that of clouds which drift in front of the sun without ever defeating its light.","N\u016bllum magnum ingenium sine mixt\u016br\u0101 d\u0113mentiae fuitNo great talent without an element of madness","Set aside a certain number of days, during which you shall be content with the scantiest and cheapest fare, with course and rough dress, saying to yourself the while: \'Is this the condition that I feared?","It is a great man that can treat his earthenware as if it was silver, and a man who treats his silver as if it was earthenware is no less great.","Nothing is ours, except time.","vices have to be crushed rather than picked at.","In the meantime, cling tooth and nail to the following rule: not to give in to adversity, not to trust prosperity, and always take full note of fortune\u2019s habit of behaving just as she pleases.","What difference does it make how much is laid away in a man\'s safe or in his barns, how many head of stock he grazes or how much capital he puts out at interest, if he is always after what is another\'s and only counts what he has yet to get, never what he has already? You ask what is the proper limit to a person\'s wealth? First, having what is essential, and second, having what is enough.","Do not run hither and thither and distract yourself by changing your abode; for such restlessness is the sign of a disordered spirit.","Are you surprised, as if it were a novelty, that after such long travel and so many changes of scene you have not been able to shake off the gloom and heaviness of your mind? You need a change of soul rather than a change of climate. [...] Do you ask why such flight does not help you? It is because you flee along with yourself. You must lay aside the burdens of the mind; until you do this, no place will satisfy you.","If wisdom were offered me on the one condition that I should keep it shut away and not divulge it to anyone, I should reject it. There is no enjoying the possession of anything valuable unless one has someone to share it with.","No prizefighter can go with high spirits into the strife if he has never been beaten black and blue; the only contestant who can confidently enter the lists is the man who has seen his own blood, who has felt his teeth rattle beneath his opponent\'s fist, who has been tripped and felt the full force of his adversary\'s charge, who has been downed in bloody but not it spirit, one who as often as he falls, rises again with greater defiance than ever.","There are more things likely to frighten us than there are to crush us; we suffer more in our imagination than in reality.","In truth, Serenus, I have for a long time been silently asking myself to what I should liken such a condition of mind, and I can find nothing that so closely approaches it as the state of those who, after being released from a long and serious illness, are sometimes touched with fits of fever and slight disorders, and, freed from the last traces of them, are nevertheless disquieted with mistrust, and, though now quite well, stretch out their wrist to a physician and complain unjustly of any trace of heat in their body. It is not, Serenus, that these are not quite well in body, but that they are not quite used to being well; just as even a tranquil sea will show some ripple, particularly when it has just subsided after a storm. What you need, therefore, is not any of those harsher measures which we have already left behind, the necessity of opposing yourself at this point, of being angry with yourself at that, of sternly urging yourself on at another, but that which comes last -confidence in yourself and the belief that you are on the right path, and have not been led astray by the many cross- tracks of those who are roaming in every direction, some of whom are wandering very near the path itself. But what you desire is something great and supreme and very near to being a god - to be unshaken.","Imperare sibi maximum imperium est","It is not what you endure that matters, but how you endure it.","For manliness gains much strength by being challenged","Religion is regarded by the common people as true, by the wise as false, and by the rulers as useful","A wise man never asks what another man serves, for only his actions will speak the truth.","the time of the actual enjoyment is short and swift, and made much shorter through their own fault. For they dash from one pleasure to another and cannot stay steady in one desire.","The whole future lies in uncertainty: live immediately.","that you would not anticipate misery since the evils you dread as coming upon you may perhaps never reach you at least they are not yet come Thus some things torture us more than they ought, some before they ought and some which ought never to torture us at all. We heighten our pain either by presupposing a cause or anticipation","Nothing, Lucilius, is ours, except time. We were entrusted by nature with the ownership of this single thing, so fleeting and slippery that anyone who will can oust us from possession.","It is in no man\'s power to have whatever he wants, but he has it in his power not to wish for what he hasn\'t got, and cheerfully make the most of the things that do come his way.","No man\u2019s good by accident. Virtue has to be learnt.","You are living as if destined to live for ever; your own frailty never occurs to you; you don\'t notice how much time has already passed, but squander it as though you had a full and overflowing supply - though all the while that very day which you are devoting to somebody or something may be your last. You act like mortals in all that you fear, and like immortals in all that you desire.","Why do I not rather seek some real good - one which I could feel, not one which I could display? These things that draw the eyes of men, before which they halt, which they show to one another in wonder, outwardly glitter, but are worthless within.","Every day as it comes should be welcomed and reduced forthwith into our own possession as if it were the finest day imaginable. What flies past has to be seized at.","Diligentia maximum etiam mediocris ingeni subsidium - Diligence is a very great help even to a mediocre intelligence.","Aequat omnes cinis.","Fire is the test of gold; adversity, of strong men.","It is not that we have a short space of time, but that we waste much of it. Life is long enough, and it has been given in sufficiently generous measure to allow the accomplishment of the very greatest things if the whole of it is well invested. But when it is squandered in luxury and carelessness, when it is devoted to no good end, forced at last by the ultimate necessity we perceive that it has passed away before we were aware that it was passing.","It is a denial of justice not to stretch out a helping hand to the fallen; that is the common right of humanity.","Soft living imposes on us the penalty of debility; we cease to be able to do the things we\'ve long been grudging about doing.","Il maggiore ostacolo al vivere \xe8 l\u2019attesa, che dipende dal domani e consuma l\u2019oggi.","Let no one,\' I say, \'who will make me no worthy return for such a loss rob me of a single day; let my mind be fixed upon itself, let it cultivate itself, let it busy itself with nothing outside, nothing that looks towards an umpire; let it love the tranquillity that is remote from public and private concern.","Bonis nocet, qui malis parcit. He harms the good (people) who spares the evil.","But only philosophy will wake us; only philosophy will shake us out of that heavy sleep. Devote yourself entirely to her. You\'re worthy of her, she\'s worthy of you-fall into each other\'s arms. Say a firm, plain no to every other occupation.","Why be concerned about others, come to that, when you\'ve outdone your own self? Set yourself a limit which you couldn\'t even exceed if you wanted to, and say good-bye at last to those deceptive prizes more precious to those who hope for them than to those who have won them. If there were anything substantial in them they would sooner or later bring a sense of fullness; as it is they simply aggravate the thirst of those who swallow them.","As often as I have been amongst men, I have returned less a man.","However much you possess there\'s someone else who has more, and you\'ll be fancying yourself to be short of things you need to exact extent to which you lag behind him.","Indeed the state of all who are preoccupied is wretched, but the most wretched are those who are toiling not even at their own preoccupations, but must regulate their sleep by another\'s, and their walk by another\'s pace, and obey orders in those freest of all things, loving and hating. If such people want to know how short their lives are, let them reflect how small a portion is their own.","It does good also to take walks out of doors, that our spirits may be raised and refreshed by the open air and fresh breeze: sometimes we gain strength by driving in a carriage, by travel, by change of air, or by social meals and a more generous allowance of wine.","I never spend a day in idleness; I appropriate even a part of the night for study. I do not allow time for sleep but yield to it when I must, and when my eyes are wearied with waking and ready to fall shut, I keep them at their task.","If you have nothing to stir you up and rouse you to action, nothing which will test your resolution by its threats and hostilities; if you recline in unshaken comfort, it is not tranquillity; it is merely a flat calm.","It is our conscience, not our pride, that has put doorkeepers at our doors.","Why do we complain of Nature? She has shown herself kindly; life, if you know how to use it, is long. But one man is possessed by an avarice that is insatiable, another by a toilsome devotion to tasks that are useless; one man is besotted with wine, another is paralyzed by sloth; one man is exhausted by an ambition that always hangs upon the decision of others, another, driven on by the greed of the trader, is led over all lands and all seas by the hope of gain; some are tormented by a passion for war and are always either bent upon inflicting danger upon others or concerned about their own; some there are who are worn out by voluntary servitude in a thankless attendance upon the great; many are kept busy either in the pursuit of other men\'s fortune or in complaining of their own; many, following no fixed aim, shifting and inconstant and dissatisfied, are plunged by their fickleness into plans that are ever new; some have no fixed principle by which to direct their course, but Fate takes them unawares while they loll and yawn\u2014so surely does it happen that I cannot doubt the truth of that utterance which the greatest of poets delivered with all the seeming of an oracle: \\"The part of life we really live is small.\\"5 For all the rest of existence is not life, but merely time. Vices beset us and surround us on every side, and they do not permit us to rise anew and lift up our eyes for the discernment of truth, but they keep us down when once they have overwhelmed us and we are chained to lust. Their victims are never allowed to return to their true selves; if ever they chance to find some release, like the waters of the deep sea which continue to heave even after the storm is past, they are tossed about, and no rest from their lusts abides. Think you that I am speaking of the wretches whose evils are admitted? Look at those whose prosperity men flock to behold; they are smothered by their blessings. To how many are riches a burden! From how many do eloquence and the daily straining to display their powers draw forth blood! How many are pale from constant pleasures! To how many does the throng of clients that crowd about them leave no freedom! In short, run through the list of all these men from the lowest to the highest\u2014this man desires an advocate,6 this one answers the call, that one is on trial, that one defends him, that one gives sentence; no one asserts his claim to himself, everyone is wasted for the sake of another. Ask about the men whose names are known by heart, and you will see that these are the marks that distinguish them: A cultivates B and B cultivates C; no one is his own master. And then certain men show the most senseless indignation\u2014they complain of the insolence of their superiors, because they were too busy to see them when they wished an audience! But can anyone have the hardihood to complain of the pride of another when he himself has no time to attend to himself? After all, no matter who you are, the great man does sometimes look toward you even if his face is insolent, he does sometimes condescend to listen to your words, he permits you to appear at his side; but you never deign to look upon yourself, to give ear to yourself. There is no reason, therefore, to count anyone in debt for such services, seeing that, when you performed them, you had no wish for another\'s company, but could not endure your own.","It is the quality of a great soul to scorn great things and to prefer that which is ordinary rather than that which is too great.","Even for studies, where expenditure is most honorable, it is justifiable only so long as it is kept within bounds. What is the use of having countless books and libraries, whose titles their owners can scarcely read through in a whole lifetime? The learner is, not instructed, but burdened by the mass of them, and it is much better to surrender yourself to a few authors than to wander through many.","Non scholae sed vitae discimus.","For love of bustle is not industry, \u2014it is only the restlessness of a hunted mind.","We are in the habit of saying that it was not in our power to choose the parents who were allotted to us, that they were given to us by chance. But we can choose whose children we would like to be.","The boon that could be given can be withdrawn.","Love sometimes injures. Friendship always benefits, After friendship is formed you must trust, but before that you must judge.","But is life really worth so much? Let us examine this; it\'s a different inquiry. We will offer no solace for so desolate a prison house; we will encourage no one to endure the overlordship of butchers. We shall rather show that in every kind of slavery, the road of freedom lies open. I will say to the man to whom it befell to have a king shoot arrows at his dear ones [Prexaspes], and to him whose master makes fathers banquet on their sons\' guts [Harpagus]: \'What are you groaning for, fool?... Everywhere you look you find an end to your sufferings. You see that steep drop-off? It leads down to freedom. You see that ocean, that river, that well? Freedom lies at its bottom. You see that short, shriveled, bare tree? Freedom hangs from it.... You ask, what is the path to freedom? Any vein in your body.","Most powerful is he who has himself in his power.","The happy life is a life that is in harmony with its own nature.","Only a mind that is deeply stirred can utter something noble and beyond the power of others.","The man who fears death will never do anything worthy of a man who is alive.","There is no favorable wind for the sailor who doesn\u2019t know where to go","...there is nothing the wise man does reluctantly. He escapes necessity because he wills what necessity is going to force on him.","No good thing renders its possessor happy, unless his mind is reconciled to the possibility of loss; nothing, however, is lost with less discomfort than that which, when lost, cannot be missed.","But nothing will help quite so much as just keeping quiet, talking with other people as little as possible, with yourself as much as possible. For conversation has a kind of charm about it, an insinuating and insidious something that elicits secrets from us just like love or liquor. Nobody will keep the things he hears to himself, and nobody will repeat just what he hears and no more. Neither will anyone who has failed to keep a story to himself keep the name of his informant to himself. Every person without exception has someone to whom he confides everything that is confided to himself. Even supposing he puts some guard in his garrulous tongue and is content with a single pair of ears, he will still be the creator of a host of later listeners \u2013 such is the way in which what was but a little while before a secret becomes common rumor.","It is sweet to draw the world down with you when you are perishing.","No man is good by chance. Virtue is something which must be learned.","If you live according to nature, you will never be poor; if you live according to opinion, you will never be rich.","the mind is never right but when it is at peace with itself","Non est ad astra mollis e terris via.","All those who call you to themselves draw you away from yourself.","True happiness is to enjoy the present, without anxious dependence upon the future, not to amuse ourselves with either hopes or fears but to rest satisfied with what we have, which is sufficient, for he that is so wants nothing.","However, the two things must be mingled and varied, solitude and joining a crowd: the one will make us long for people and the other for ourselves, and each will be a remedy for the other; solitude will cure our distaste for a crowd, and a crowd will cure our boredom with solitude.","What progress, you ask, have I made? I have begun to be a friend to myself.\\" That was indeed a great benefit; such a person can never be alone. You may be sure that such a man is a friend to all mankind.","It is uncertain where Death will await you;there expect it everywhere.","So you must not think a man has lived long because he has white hair and wrinkles: he has not lived long, just existed long. For suppose you should think that a man had had a long voyage who had been caught in a raging storm as he left harbour, and carried hither and thither and driven round and round in a circle by the rage opposing winds. He did not have a long voyage, just a long tossing about.","Bibamus, moriendum est.","Barley porridge, or a crust of barley bread, and water do not make a very cheerful diet, but nothing gives one keener pleasure than having the ability to derive pleasure even from that-- and the feeling of having arrived at something which one cannot be deprived of by any unjust stroke of fortune.","Learning how to live takes a whole life, and, which may surprise you more, it takes a whole life to learn how to die.","philosophy teaches us to act, not to speak;","So the life of a philosopher extends widely: he is not confined by the same boundary as are others. He alone is free from the laws that limit the human race, and all ages serve him as though he were a god.","To be everywhere; is to be nowhere","If i had not been admitted to these studies it would not have been worth while to have been born.","It\u2019s not that we have a short time to live, but that we waste a lot of it. -Lucius Annaeus Seneca\u201d","There will always be causes for anxiety, whether due to prosperity or to wretchedness. Life will be driven on through a succession of preoccupations: we shall always long for leisure, but never enjoy it.","Sorrowers tend to avoid what they are most fond of and try to give vent to their grief.","It is not that we have a short time to live but that we waste a lot of it.","We are, therefore, seeking how the mind can follow a smooth and steady course, well disposed to itself, happily regarding its own condition and with no interruption to this pleasure, but remaining in a state of peace with no ups and downs: that will be tranquillity.","Your greatest difficulty is with yourself; for you are your own stumbling-block. You do not know what you want. You are better at approving the right course than at following it out. You see where the true happiness lies, but you have not the courage to attain it.","If you look on wealth as a thing to be valued you\u2019ll always fancy yourself to be short of the things you need to the extent to which you lag behind what others have.","A family formed by crime must be broken by more crime.","I judge you unfortunate because you have never lived through misfortune. You have passed through life without an opponent\u2014no one can ever know what you are capable of, not even you.","Oh, what darkness does great prosperity cast over our minds!","Just as great and princely wealth is scattered in a moment when it comes into the hands of a bad owner, while wealth however limited, if it is entrusted to a good guardian, increases by use, so our life is amply long for him who orders it properly.","Love of bustle is not industry.","Continue to act thus, my dear Lucilius \u2013 set yourself free for your own sake; gather and save your time, which till lately has been forced from you, or filched away, or has merely slipped from your hands. Make yourself believe the truth of my words, \u2013 that certain moments are torn from us, that some are gently removed, and that others glide beyond our reach. The most disgraceful kind of loss, however, is that due to carelessness. Furthermore, if you will pay close heed to the problem, you will find that the largest portion of our life passes while we are doing ill, a goodly share while we are doing nothing, and the whole while we are doing that which is not to the purpose. What man can you show me who places any value on his time, who reckons the worth of each day, who understands that he is dying daily? For we are mistaken when we look forward to death; the major portion of death has already passed. Whatever years be behind us are in death\'s hands.","Away with the world\u2019s opinion of you \u2013 it\u2019s always unsettled and divided. Away with the pursuits that have occupied the whole of your life \u2013 death is going to deliver the verdict in your case. ... It\u2019s only when you\u2019re breathing your last that the way you\u2019ve spent your time will become apparent.","The trip doesn\u2019t exist that can set you beyond the reach of cravings, fits of temper, or fears \u2026 so long as you carry the sources of your troubles about with you, those troubles will continue to harass and plague you wherever you wander on land or on sea. Does it surprise you that running away doesn\u2019t do you any good? The things you\u2019re running away from are with you all the time.","I imagine many people could have achieved wisdom if they had not imagined they had already achieved it, if they had not dissembled about some of their own characteristics and turned a blind eye to others.","So it is inevitable that life will be not just very short but very miserable for those who acquire by great toil what they must keep by greater toil.","So what you need is not those more radical remedies which we have now finished with \u2013 blocking yourself here, being angry with yourself there, threatening yourself sternly somewhere else \u2013 but the final treatment, confidence in yourself and the belief that you are on the right path, and not led astray by the many tracks which cross yours of people who are hopelessly lost, though some are wandering not far from the true path.","Possession of a friend should be with the spirit: the spirit\'s never absent: it sees daily whoever it likes.","Humanity is the quality which stops one being arrogant towards one\'s fellows, or being acrimonious.","When Zeno received news of a shipwreck and heard that all his luggage had been sunk he said, \\"Fortune bids me to be a less encumbered philosopher.","The highest good is a mind that scorns the happenings of chance, and rejoices only in virtue.","Life, if you know how to use it, is long; but\u2026many, following no fixed aim, shifting and\u2026 dissatisfied, are plunged by their fickleness into plans that are ever new; some have no fixed principle by which to direct their course.","Can anything be sillier than the point of view of certain people\u2014I mean those who boast of their foresight? They keep themselves very busily engaged in order that they may be able to live better; they spend life in making ready to live! They form their purposes with a view to the distant future; yet postponement is the greatest waste of life; it deprives them of each day as it comes, it snatches from them the present by promising something hereafter. The greatest hindrance to living is expectancy, which depends upon the morrow and wastes to-day. You dispose of that which lies in the hands of Fortune, you let go that which lies in your own.","I shall never be ashamed to go to a bad author for a good quotation.","Excellence withers without an adversary.","So the man who restrains himself within the bounds set by nature will not notice poverty; the man who exceeds these bounds will be pursued by poverty however rich he","Our minds must relax: they will rise better and keener after a rest. Just as you must not force fertile farmland, as uninterrupted productivity will soon exhaust it, so constant effort will sap our mental vigour, while a short period of rest and relaxation will restore our powers.","And so when you see a man often wearing the robe of office, when you see one whose name is famous in the Forum, do not envy him; those things are bought at the price of life. They will waste all their years, in order that they may have one year reckoned by their name.","No man has ever been so far advanced by Fortune that she did not threaten him as greatly as she had previously indulged him. Do not trust her seeming calm; in a moment the sea is moved to its depths. The very day the ships have made a brave show in the games, they are engulfed.","One can expect an agreement between philosophers sooner than between clocks.","It is better to conquer our grief than to deceive it. For if it has withdrawn, being merely beguiled by pleasures and preoccupations, it starts up again and from its very respite gains force to savage us. But the grief that has been conquered by reason is calmed for ever. I am not therefore going to prescribe for you those remedies which I know many people have used, that you divert or cheer yourself by a long or pleasant journey abroad, or spend a lot of time carefully going through your accounts and administering your estate, or constantly be involved in some new activity. All those things help only for a short time; they do not cure grief but hinder it. But I would rather end it than distract it.","...nothing happens to the wise man against his expectation.","How silly then to imagine that the human mind, which is formed of the same elements as divine beings, objects to movement and change of abode, while the divine nature finds delight and even self-preservation in continual and very rapid change.","From this state also will he flee. If I should attempt to enumerate them one by one, I should not find a single one which could tolerate the wise man or which the wise man could tolerate.","He will live ill who does not know how to die well","There is no great genius without a tincture of madness.","Still, you must especially avoid those who are gloomy and always lamenting, and who grasp at every pretext for complaint. Though a man\'s loyalty and kindness may not be in doubt, a companion who is agitated and groaning about everything is an enemy to peace of mind.","O tempo revela a verdade.","Vivere militare est","If you look on wealth as a thing to be valued your imaginary poverty will cause you torment.","For Fate/ The willing leads, the unwilling drags along.","There is but one chain holding us in fetters, and that is our love of life.","Philosophy is good advice; and no one can give advice at the top of his lungs.","So long, in fact, as you remain in ignorance of what to aim at and what to avoid, what is essential and what is superfluous, what is upright or honorable conduct and what is not, it will not be travelling but drifting. All this hurrying from place to place won\u2019t bring you any relief, for you\u2019re travelling in the company of your own emotions, followed by your troubles all the way.","Let us take pleasure in what we have received and make no comparison; no man will ever be happy if tortured by the greater happiness of another.","No man has escaped paying the penalty for being born.","So it is: we are not given a short life but we make it short, and we are not ill-supplied but wasteful of it. Just as when ample and princely wealth falls to a bad owner it is squandered in a moment, but wealth however modest, if entrusted to a good custodian, increases with use, so our lifetime extends amply if you manage it properly.","Believe me if you consult philosophy she will persuade you not to lit so long at your counting desk","And when the soul has yielded to pleasure, its functions and actions grow weak, and any undertaking comes from a nerveless and unsteady source.","Life is divided into three parts: what was, what is and what shall be. Of these three periods, the present is short, the future is doubtful and the past alone is certain.","What then is good? The knowledge of things. What is evil? The lack of knowledge of things.","putting things off is the biggest waste of life: it snatches away each day as it comes, and denies us the present by promising the future. The greatest obstacle to living is expectancy, which hangs upon tomorrow and loses today. You are arranging what lies in Fortune\u2019s control, and abandoning what lies in yours.","We are indeed apt to ascribe certain faults to the place or to the time; but those faults will follow us, no matter how we change our place.","I am loath to call clemency what was, rather, the exhaustion of cruelty.","what is freedom, you ask?\xa0 It means not being a slave to any circumstance, to any constraint, to any chance; it","Everyone hurries his life on and suffers from a yearning for the future and a weariness of the present. But he who bestows all of his time on his own needs, who plans out every day as if it were his last, neither longs for nor fears the morrow.","The fool, with all his other faults, has this also, he is always getting ready to live.","The mind when distracted absorbs nothing deeply.","Those who wish their virtue to be advertised are not striving for virtue but for renown. Are you not willing to be just without being renowned? Nay, indeed you must often be just and be at the same time disgraced. And then, if you are wise, let ill repute, well won, be a delight. Farewell.","Suspice, etiam si decidunt, magna conantes \\" \\"Admire those who attempt great things, even though they fail\\"\\"Admira, incluso si caen, a quienes emprenden grandes iniciativas","to make Pythocles rich, do not add to his store of money, but subtract from his desires.","The day which we fear is out last is buth the birthday of eternity","Therefore, my dear Lucilius, begin at once to live, and count each separate day as a separate life.

I have begun to be a friend to myself.\\" That wasindeed a great benefit; such a person can never be alone. You may be sure that such a man is a friend to all mankind.","Let us prepare our minds as if we\u2019d come to the very end of life. Let us postpone nothing. Let us balance life\u2019s books each day. \u2026 The one who puts the finishing touches on their life each day is never short of time.","Ducunt volentem fata, nolentem trahunt.","I never spend a day in idleness; I appropriate even a part of the night for study. I do not allow time for sleep but yield to it when I must, and when my eyes are wearied with waking and ready to fall shut, I keep them at their task. 2. I have withdrawn not only from men, but from affairs, especially from my own affairs; I am working for later generations, writing down some ideas that may be of assistance to them.","Why not stop trying to prevent posterity being silent about you? You were born to die, and a silent funeral is less bothersome.","by overloading the body with food you strangle the soul and render it less active.","Be careful, however, lest this reading of many authors and books of every sort may tend to make you discursive and unsteady. You must linger among a limited number of master thinkers, and digest their works, if you would derive ideas which shall win firm hold in your mind. Everywhere means nowhere. When a person spends all his time in foreign travel, he ends by having many acquaintances, but no friends. And the same thing must hold true of men who seek intimate acquaintance with no single author, but visit them all in a hasty and hurried manner.","Once you have rid yourself of the affliction there, though, every change of scene will become a pleasure. You may be banished to the ends of the earth, and yet in whatever outlandish corner of the world you may find yourself stationed, you will find that place, whatever it may be like, a hospitable home. Where you arrive does not matter so much as what sort of person you are when you arrive there.","In the ashes all men are levelled. We\'re born unequal, we die equal.","Of all people only those are at leisure who make time for philosophy, only those are really alive. For they not only keep a good watch over their own lifetimes, but they annex every age to theirs. All the years that have passed before them are added to their own. Unless we are very ungrateful, all those distinguished founders of holy creeds were born for us and prepared for us a way of life. By the toil of others we are led into the presence of things which have been brought from darkness into light. We are excluded from no age, but we have access to them all; and if we are prepared in loftiness of mind to pass beyond the narrow confines of human weakness, there is a long period of time through which we can roam.","Any man,\u2019 he says, \u2018who does not think that what he has is more than ample, is an unhappy man, even if he is the master of the whole world.","If you gain from a crime, you did it.","My thought for today is something which I found in Epicurus (yes, I actually make a practice of going over to the enemy\u2019s camp \u2013 by way of reconnaissance, not as a deserter!). \u2018A cheerful poverty,\u2019 he says, \u2018is an honourable state.\u2019 But if it is cheerful it is not poverty at all. It is not the man who has too little who is poor, but the one who hankers after more. What difference does it make how much there is laid away in a man\u2019s safe or in his barns, how many head of stock he grazes or how much capital he puts out at interest, if he is always after what is another\u2019s and only counts what he has yet to get, never what he has already. You ask what is the proper limit to a person\u2019s wealth? First, having what is essential, and second, having what is enough.","Stop preventing philosophers from possessing money; no one has condemned wisdom to poverty. I will despise whatever lies in the domain of Fortune, but if a choice is offered, I will choose the better half.","It takes all of our life to learn how to live, and \u2013 something that may surprise you more \u2013 it takes just as long to learn how to die.","There is an old adage about gladiators, - that they plan their fight in the ring.","We are weak, watery beings standing in the midst of unrealities; therefore let us turn our minds to the things that are everlasting.","Truth often harms the one who digs it up.","In times of happiness, no point in shaking things up.But in a time of crisis, the safest thing is change.","\u2026because it is natural to touch more often the parts that hurt.","they Whatever can make life truly happy is absolutely good in its own right because it cannot be warped into evil From whence then comes error In that while all men wish for a happy life they mistake the means for the thing itself and while they fancy themselves in pursuit of it they are flying from it for when the sum of happiness consists in solid tranquillity and an unembarrassed confidence therein they are ever collecting causes of disquiet and not only carry burthens but drag them painfully along through the rugged and deceitful path of life so that they still withdraw themselves from the good effect proposed the more pains they take the more business they have upon their hands instead of advancing they are retrograde and as it happens in a labyrinth their very speed puzzles and confounds them","No good thing renders its possessor happy, unless his mind is reconciled to the possibility of loss.","All fools suffer the burden of dissatisfaction with themselves.","Life\u2019s like a play. It\u2019s not the length but the excellence of the acting that matters.","To want to know more than is sufficient is a form of intemperance. Apart from which this kind of obsession with the liberal arts turns people into pedantic, irritating, tactless, self-satisfied bores, not learning what they need simply because they spend their time learning things they will never need. The scholar Didymus wrote four thousand works: I should feel sorry him if he had merely read so many useless works.","You squander time as if you drew from a full and abundant supply, though all the while that day which you bestow on some person or thing is perhaps your last.","Prove - and an easy task it is - that so-called pleasures, when they go beyond a certain limit, are but punishments...","[Philosophers] have come to envy the philologist and the mathematician, and they have taken over all the inessential elements in those studies\u2014with the result that they know more about devoting care and attention to their speech than about devoting such attention to their lives.","To live under constraint is a misfortune, but there is no constraint to live under constraint.","Everlasting misfortune does have one blessing, that it ends up by toughening those whom it constantly afflicts.","Our universe is a sorry little affair unless it has in it something for every age to investigate.","Everyone goes out of life just as if he had but lately entered.","Kalau anda ingin orang lain merahasiakan rahasia anda, simpanlah sendiri rahasia itu.","if we do not want to be overwhelmed and struck numb by rare events as if they were unprecedented ones; fortune needs envisaging in a thoroughly comprehensive way.","we are mistaken when we look forward to death; the major portion of death has already passed, Whatever years be behind us are in death\'s hands.","Mankind is perpetually the victim of a pointless and futile martydom, fretting life away in fruitless worries though failure to realise what limit is set to acquisition and to the growth of genuine pleasure","I see that you have come to the last stage of human life; you are close upon your hundreth year, or even beyond: come now, hold an audit of your life. Reckon how much of your time has been taken up by a money-lender, how much by a mistress, a patron, a client, quarreling with your wife, punishing your slaves, dashing about the city on your social obligations. Consider also the diseases which we have brought on ourselves, and the time too which has been unused. You will find that you have fewer years than you reckon. Call to mind when you ever had a fixed purpose; how few days have passed as you had planned; when you were ever at your own disposal; when your face wore its natural expression; when your mind was undisturbed; what work you have achieved in such a long life; how many have plundered your life when you were unaware of your losses; how much you have lost through groundless sorrow, foolish joy, greedy desire, the seductions of society; how little of your own was left to you. You will realize that you are dying prematurely.","You must linger among a limited number of master thinkers, and digest their works, if you would derive ideas which shall win firm hold in your mind.","The primary indication, to my thinking, of a well-ordered mind is a man\'s ability to remain in one place and linger in his own company.","So you must not think a man has lived long because he has white hair and wrinkles: he has not lived long, just existed long. For suppose you should think that a man had had a long voyage who had been caught in a raging storm as he left harbour, and carried hither and thither and driven round and round in a circle by the rage of opposing winds? He did not have a long voyage, just a long tossing about.","Let us cherish and love old age; for it is full of pleasure if one knows how to use it. Fruits are most welcome when almost over; youth is most charming at its close; the last drink delights the toper, the glass which souses him and puts the finishing touch on his drunkenness. Each pleasure reserves to the end the greatest delights which it contains. Life is most delightful when it is on the downward slope, but has not yet reached the abrupt decline.","In guarding their fortune men are often closefisted, yet, when it comes to the matter of wasting time, in the case of the one thing in which it is right to be miserly, they show themselves most prodigal.","Similarly, too rich a soil makes the grain fall flat, branches break down under too heavy a load, excessive productiveness does not bring fruit to ripeness.","Love sometimes injures. Friendship always benefits","Reasons for anxiety will never be lacking, whether born of prosperity or of wretchedness; life pushes on in a succession of engrossments. We shall always pray for leisure, but never enjoy it.","Daher mu\xdf man sich durchringen zur Freiheit; diese aber erreicht man durch nichts anderes als durch Gleichg\xfcltigkeit gegen das Schicksal.","It is in times of security that the spirit should be preparing itself for difficult times; while fortune is bestowing favors on it is then is the time for it to be strengthened against her rebuffs.","There is nothing in the world so much admired as a man who knows how to bear unhappiness with courage.\\"\u2014 Seneca","what\'s the use of overcoming opponent after opponent in the wrestling or boxing rings if you can be overcome by your temper?","You act like mortals in all that you fear, and like immortals in all that you desire.","a good man will not waste himself upon mean and discreditable work or be busy merely for the sake of being busy.","Our Stoic philosophers, as you know, maintain that there are two elements in the universe from which all things are derived, namely cause and matter. Matter lies inert and inactive, a substance with limited potential, but destined to remain idle if no one sets it in motion; and it is cause (this meaning the same as reason) which turns matter to whatever end it wishes and fashions it into a variety of different products.","Leisure without study is death; it is a tomb for the living man.","The world you see, nature\'s greatest and most glorious creation, and the human mind which gazes and wonders at it, and is the most splendid part of it, these are our own everlasting possessions and will remain with us as long as we ourselves remain. So, eager and upright, let us hasten with bold steps wherever circumstances take us, and let us journey through any countries whatever: there can be no place of exile within the world since nothing within the world is alien to men.","Theseus: What is the crime for which you must pay by death?Phaedra: My life.","Night brings our troubles to the light rather than banishes them.","Cling, therefore, to this sound and wholesome plan of life; indulge the body just so far as suffices for good health. ... Your food should appease your hunger, your drink quench your thirst, your clothing keep out the cold, your house be a protection against inclement weather. It makes no difference whether it is built of turf or variegated marble imported from another country: what you have to understand is that thatch makes a person just as good a roof as gold.","There is never a time when new distraction will not show up; we sow them, so several will grow from the same seed.","But nothing delights the mind so much as fond and loyal friendship. What a blessing it is to have hearts that are ready and willing to receive all your secretes in safety, with whom you are less afraid to share knowledge of something than keep it to yourself, whose conversation soothes your distress, whose advice helps you make up your mind, whose cheerfulness dissolves your sorrow, whose very appearance cheers you up!","prosperity does not elevate the sage and adversity does not depress him. For he has always made the effort to rely as much as possible on himself and to derive all delight from himself.","Pain is slight if opinion has added nothing to it; ... in thinking it slight, you will make it slight. Everything depends on opinion. It is according to opinion that we suffer. A man is as wretched as he has convinced himself that he is.","pleasure, unless it has been kept within bounds, tends to rush headlong into the abyss of sorrow.","What difference does it make whether they are slaves of free men, freeborn or freedmen, owing their freedom to the laws or to a gift made in the presence of friends? Wherever there is a human being, there exists the opportunity for an act of kindness.","For all other things, which arouse our desires, depress the soul and weaken it, and when we think that they are uplifting the soul, they are merely puffing it up and cheating it with much emptiness. Therefore, that alone is good which will make the soul better.","\u0643\u0626\u064a\u0628\u0629 \u062a\u0644\u0643 \u0627\u0644\u062d\u064a\u0627\u0629 \u0627\u0644\u062a\u064a \u064a\u0634\u0639\u0631 \u0627\u0644\u0627\u0646\u0633\u0627\u0646 \u0628\u0627\u0644\u062e\u062c\u0644 \u0644\u0642\u0628\u0648\u0644\u0647\u0627.","Everyone hustles his life along, and is troubled by a longing for the future and weariness of the present.","The surest way for those who want to rule is praising moderation, talking of peace and quiet.","How much better it is that you defeat anger than that it defeats itself!","Not all men are wounded in the same place; and so you ought to know what part of you is weak, so you can give it the most protection.","Peace you can claim for yourself without being disliked by anyone, without any sense of loss, and without any pangs of spirit.","When Zeno received news of a shipwreck and heard that all his luggage had been sunk he said, \'Fortune bids me to be a less encumbered philosopher.","And there\u2019s no state of slavery more disgraceful than one which is self-imposed.","If he lose a hand through disease or war, or if some accident puts out one or both of his eyes, he will be satisfied with what is left, taking as much pleasure in his impaired and maimed body as he took when it was sound. But while he does not pine for these parts if they are missing, he prefers not to lose them. 5. In this sense the wise man is self-sufficient, that he can do without friends, not that he desires to do without them. When I say \\"can,\\" I mean this: he endures the loss of a friend with equanimity.","Non qui parum habet, sed qui plus cupit pauper est.","it makes no difference how important the provocation may be, but into what kind of soul it penetrates. Similarly with fire; it does not matter how great is the flame, but what it falls upon.","No past life has been lived to lend us glory, and that which has existed before us is not ours.","The difference here between the Epicurean and our own school is this: our wise man feels his troubles but overcomes them, while their wise man does not even feel them. We share with them the belief that the wise man is content with himself. Nevertheless, self-sufficient though he is, he still desires a friend, a neighbour, a companion. Notice how self-contented he is: on occasion such a man is content with a mere partial self \u2013 if he loses a hand as a result of war or disease, or has one of his eyes, or even both, put out in an accident, he will be satisfied with what remains of himself and be no less pleased with his body now that it is maimed and incomplete than he was when it was whole. But while he does not hanker after what he has lost, he does prefer not to lose them. And this is what we mean when we say the wise man is self-content; he is so in the sense that he is able to do without friends, not that he desires to do without them. When I speak of his being \u2018able\u2019 to do this, what I am saying in fact amounts to this: he bears the loss of a friend with equanimity.","None of these men will bring about your death any time sooner, but rather they will teach you how to die. None of them will shorten your lifespan, but each will add the wisdom of his years to yours. In other words, there is nothing dangerous about talking to these people and it won\u2019t cost you a penny. Take from them as much as you wish. It\u2019s up to you to squeeze the most you can from their wisdom. What bliss, what a glorious old age awaits the man who has offered himself as a mate to these intellects! He will have mentors and colleagues from whom he may seek advice on the smallest of matters, companions ever ready with counsel for his daily life, from whom he may hear truth without judgment, praise without flattery, and after whose likeness he may fashion himself. They say \u2018you can\u2019t choose your parents,\u2019 that they have been given to us by chance; but the good news is we can choose to be the sons of whomever we desire. There are many respectable fathers scattered across the centuries to choose from. Select a genius and make yourself their adopted son. You could even inherit their name and make claim to be a true descendant and then go forth and share this wealth of knowledge with others. These men will show you the way to immortality, and raise you to heights from which no man can be cast down. This is the only way to extend mortality \u2013 truly, by transforming time into immortality. Honors, statues and all other mighty monuments to man\u2019s ambition carved in stone will crumble but the wisdom of the past is indestructible. Age cannot wither nor destroy philosophy which serves all generations. Its vitality is strengthened by each new generation\u2019s contribution to it. The Philosopher alone is unfettered by the confines of humanity. He lives forever, like a god. He embraces memory, utilizes the present and anticipates with relish what is to come. He makes his time on Earth longer by merging past, present and future into one.","\u0645\u0646 \u0644\u064a\u0633 \u0644\u062f\u064a\u0647 \u0634\u0626 \u064a\u0623\u0645\u0644 \u0641\u064a\u0647 \u0644\u064a\u0633 \u0623\u0645\u0627\u0645\u0647 \u0634\u0626 \u064a\u064a\u0623\u0633 \u0645\u0646\u0647 .","The day has already begun to lessen. It has shrunk considerably, but yet will still allow a goodly space of time if one rises, so to speak, with the day itself. We are more industrious, and we are better men if we anticipate the day and welcome the dawn;","Luck is what happens when preparation meets opportunity!","Wherever there is a human being, there exists the opportunity for an act of kindness.","Now all men suffer from ignorance of the truth; deceived by common report, they make for these ends as if they were good, and then, after having won their wish, and suffered much, they find them evil, or empty, or less important than they had expected.","They strive to attain their wishes by every available means, instructing and compelling themselves to dishonest and difficult acts. And when their labour is without reward, it is the fruitless disgrace that tortures them - they are not grieved to have desired evil things but to have desired in vain. Then remorse for what they began lays hold of them, and the fear of beginning again, and thence creeps in the agitation of mind which can find no relief - because neither can they rule nor can they obey their desires. And then comes the hesitancy of a life failing to clear a way for itself, and the dull wasting of a soul lying torpid amidst forsaken hopes.","The liberal arts do not conduct the soul all the way to virtue, but merely set it going in that direction.","What is my object in making a friend? To have someone to be able to die for, someone I may follow into exile, someone for whose life I may put myself up as security and pay the price as well. The thing you describe is not friendship but a business deal, looking to the likely consequences, with advantage as its goal. There can be no doubt that the desire lovers have for each other is not so very different from friendship \u2013 you might say it was friendship gone mad. Well, then, does anyone ever fall in love with a view to a profit, or advancement, or celebrity? Actual love in itself, heedless of all other considerations, inflames people\u2019s hearts with a passion for the beautiful object, not without the hope, too, that the affection will be mutual. How then can the nobler stimulus of friendship be associated with any ignoble desire?","I think the pinnacle of misfortune is to be forced by chance to want things one should loathe.","Beasts avoid the dangers which they see, and when they have escaped them are free from care; but we men torment ourselves over that which is to come as well as over that which is past. Many of our blessings bring bane to us; for memory recalls the tortures of fear, while foresight anticipates them. The present alone can make no man wretched.","Ignorance is no cure for suffering.","Whereas we believe lightning to be released as a result of the collision of clouds, they believe that the clouds collide so as to release lightning: for as they attribute all to deity, they are led to believe not that things have a meaning insofar as they occur, but rather that they occur because they must have a meaning.","Reflect that nothing merits admiration except thespirit, the impressiveness of which prevents it from being impressed by anything.","For to be afflicted with endless sorrow at the loss of someone very dear is foolish self-indulgence, and to feel none is inhuman callousness.","I wish Lucilius you had been so happy as to have taken this resolution long ago I wish we had not deferred to think of an happy life till now we are come within light of death But let us delay no longer","So you must not think a man has lived long because he has white hair and wrinkles: he has not lived long, just existed long.","There is nothing the busy man is less busied with than living: there is nothing that is harder to learn.","\u0423\u043f\u043e\u0440\u0438\u0442\u0430\u0442\u0430 \u0434\u043e\u0431\u0440\u0438\u043d\u0430 \u043f\u043e\u0431\u0435\u0436\u0434\u0430\u0432\u0430 \u0438 \u043d\u0430\u0439-\u043b\u043e\u0448\u043e\u0442\u043e \u0441\u044a\u0440\u0446\u0435.","No delicate breeze brings comfort with icy breath of windto the hearts which pant on the flames.","Living is the least important activity of the preoccupied man;","\u0394\u03b5\u03bd \u03c5\u03c0\u03ac\u03c1\u03c7\u03b5\u03b9 \u03bb\u03bf\u03b9\u03c0\u03cc\u03bd \u03ba\u03b1\u03bd\u03b5\u03af\u03c2 \u03bb\u03cc\u03b3\u03bf\u03c2 \u03bd\u03b1 \u03c0\u03b9\u03c3\u03c4\u03b5\u03cd\u03b5\u03b9\u03c2 \u03cc\u03c4\u03b9 \u03ba\u03ac\u03c0\u03bf\u03b9\u03bf\u03c2 \u03ad\u03c7\u03b5\u03b9 \u03b6\u03ae\u03c3\u03b5\u03b9 \u03c0\u03bf\u03bb\u03cd \u03b5\u03c0\u03b5\u03b9\u03b4\u03ae \u03ad\u03c7\u03b5\u03b9 \u03ac\u03c3\u03c0\u03c1\u03b1 \u03bc\u03b1\u03bb\u03bb\u03b9\u03ac \u03ba\u03b1\u03b9 \u03c1\u03c5\u03c4\u03af\u03b4\u03b5\u03c2\xb7 \u03b4\u03b5\u03bd \u03ad\u03b6\u03b7\u03c3\u03b5 \u03c0\u03bf\u03bb\u03cd, \u03b1\u03c0\u03bb\u03ce\u03c2 \u03ba\u03b1\u03b9 \u03bc\u03cc\u03bd\u03bf \u03c5\u03c0\u03ae\u03c1\u03be\u03b5 \u03c3\u03c4\u03b7 \u03b6\u03c9\u03ae \u03b5\u03c0\u03af \u03c0\u03bf\u03bb\u03cd.","The body\u2019s needs are few: it wants to be free from cold, to banish hunger and thirst with nourishment; if we long for anything more we are exerting ourselves to serve our vices, not our needs.","What is my object in making a friend?

What shall I achieve? That a soul which has conquered so many miseries will be ashamed to worry about one more wound in a body which already has so many scars.","Above all, my dear Lucilius, make this your business: learn how to feel joy.","For those who follow nature everything is easy and straightforward, whereas for those who fight against her life is just like rowing against the stream.","What really ruins our characters is the fact that none of us looks back over his life. We think about what we are going to do, and only rarely of that, and fail to think about what we have done, yet any plans for the future are dependent on the past.","We Stoics are not subjects of a despot: each of us lays claim to his own freedom.","And do you know why we have not the power to attain this Stoic ideal? It is because we refuse to believe in our power. Nay, of a surety, there is something else which plays a part: it is because we are in love with our vices; we uphold them and prefer to make excuses for them rather than shake them off. We mortals have been endowed with sufficient strength by nature, if only we use this strength, if only we concentrate our powers and rouse them all to help us or at least not to hinder us. The reason is unwillingness, the excuse, inability.","You may say; \\"What then? If yonder man, rich by base means, and yonder man, lord of many but slave of more, shall call themselves happy, will their own opinion make them happy?\\" It matters not what one says, but what one feels; also, not how one feels on one particular day, but how one feels at all times. There is no reason, however, why you should fear that this great privilege will fall into unworthy hands; only the wise man is pleased with his own. Folly is ever troubled with weariness of itself.","But it is one thing to remember, another to know. Remembering is merely safeguarding something entrusted to the memory; knowing, however, means making everything your own; it means not depending upon the copy and not all the time glancing back at the master.","Undisturbed by fears and unspoiled by pleasures, we shall be afraid neither of death nor the gods.","Though all the brilliant intellects of the ages were to concentrate upon this one theme, never could they adequately express their wonder at this dense darkness of the human mind. Men do not suffer anyone to seize their estates, and they rush to stones and arms if there is even the slightest dispute about the limit of their lands, yet they allow others to trespass upon their life\u2014nay, they themselves even lead in those who will eventually possess it. No one is to be found who is willing to distribute his money, yet among how many does each one of us distribute his life! In guarding their fortune men are often closefisted, yet, when it comes to the matter of wasting time, in the case of the one thing in which it is right to be miserly, they show themselves most prodigal. And so I should like to lay hold upon someone from the company of older men and say: \\"I see that you have reached the farthest limit of human life, you are pressing hard upon your hundredth year, or are even beyond it; come now, recall your life and make a reckoning. Consider how much of your time was taken up with a moneylender, how much with a mistress, how much with a patron, how much with a client, how much in wrangling with your wife, how much in punishing your slaves, how much in rushing about the city on social duties. Add the diseases which we have caused by our own acts, add, too, the time that has lain idle and unused; you will see that you have fewer years to your credit than you count. Look back in memory and consider when you ever had a fixed plan, how few days have passed as you had intended, when you were ever at your own disposal, when your face ever wore its natural expression, when your mind was ever unperturbed, what work you have achieved in so long a life, how many have robbed you of life when you were not aware of what you were losing, how much was taken up in useless sorrow, in foolish joy, in greedy desire, in the allurements of society, how little of yourself was left to you; you will perceive that you are dying before your season!\\"7 What, then, is the reason of this? You live as if you were destined to live forever, no thought of your frailty ever enters your head, of how much time has already gone by you take no heed. You squander time as if you drew from a full and abundant supply, though all the while that day which you bestow on some person or thing is perhaps your last. You have all the fears of mortals and all the desires of immortals. You will hear many men saying: \\"After my fiftieth year I shall retire into leisure, my sixtieth year shall release me from public duties.\\" And what guarantee, pray, have you that your life will last longer? Who will suffer your course to be just as you plan it? Are you not ashamed to reserve for yourself only the remnant of life, and to set apart for wisdom only that time which cannot be devoted to any business? How late it is to begin to live just when we must cease to live! What foolish forgetfulness of mortality to postpone wholesome plans to the fiftieth and sixtieth year, and to intend to begin life at a point to which few have attained!","He who needs riches least, enjoys riches most.\\"[8]","It is not the man who has too little who is poor, but the one who hankers after more.","But consider whether you may not get more help from the customary method[1] than from that which is now commonly called a \\"breviary,\\" though in the good old days, when real Latin was spoken, it was called a \\"summary.\\"[2]","Life will follow the path it began to take, and will neither reverse nor check its course. It will cause no commotion to remind you of its swiftness, but glide on quietly. It will not lengthen itself for a king\u2019s command or a people\u2019s favour. As it started out on its first day, so it will run on, nowhere pausing or turning aside. What will be the outcome? You have been preoccupied while life hastens on. Meanwhile death will arrive, and you have no choice in making yourself available for that.","Life\u2019s finest day for wretched mortals here Is always first to flee.","You are living as if destined to live for ever; your own frailty never occurs to you; you don\u2019t notice how much time has already passed, but squander it as though you had a full and overflowing supply \u2014 though all the while that very day which you are devoting to somebody or something may be your last. You act like mortals in all that you fear, and like immortals in all that you desire\u2026 How late it is to begin really to live just when life must end! How stupid to forget our mortality, and put off sensible plans to our fiftieth and sixtieth years, aiming to begin life from a point at which few have arrived!","It is regret for the absence of his loved one which causes a mourner to grieve: yet it is clear that this in itself is bearable enough; for we do not weep at their being absent or intending to be absent during their lifetime, although when they leave our sight we have no more pleasure in them. What tortures us, therefore, is an idea.","You will notice that the most powerful and highly stationed men let drop remarks in which they pray for leisure, praise it, and rate it higher than all their blessings.","When one is busy and absorbed in one\'s work, the very absorption affords great delight; but when one has withdrawn one\'s hand from the completed masterpiece, the pleasure is not so keen.","Nothing will ever please me, no matter how excellent or beneficial, if I must retain the knowledge of it to myself. And if wisdom were given me under the express condition that it must be kept hidden and not uttered, I should refuse it.No good thing is pleasant to possess, without friends to share it.","For we are not summoned according to the paristi register And besides there is no man so old as to make it sinful to expect another day. Now every day is another step in life.","To have may be taken from us, to have had, never. A man is thankless in the highest degree if, after losing something, he feels no obligation for having received it.","Who scorns his own life is lord of yours.","We are in the habit of saying that it was not in our power to choose the parents who were allotted to us, that they were given to us by chance. But we can choose whose children we would like to be. There are households of the noblest intellects: choose the one into which you wish to be adopted, and you will inherit not only their name but their property too. Nor will this property need to be guarded meanly or grudgingly: the more it is shared out, the greater it will become.","It is a small part of life we really live.\u2019 Indeed, all the rest is not life but merely time.","The soul is our king. If it be safe, the other functions remain on duty and serve with obedience; but the slightest lack of equilibrium in the soul causes them to waver along with it. And when the soul has yielded to pleasure, its functions and actions grow weak, and any undertaking comes from a nerveless and unsteady source.","I can show you a philtre, compounded without drugs, herbs, or any witch\'s incantation: \'If you want to be loved, love.","What is death? Either a transition or an end. I am not afraid of coming to an end, this being the same as never having begun, nor of transition, for I shall never be in confinement quite so cramped anywhere else as I am here.","Think for a long time whether or not you should admit a given person to your friendship. But when you have decided to do so, welcome him heart and soul, and speak as unreservedly with him as you would with yourself","[On Time] Men trifle with the most precious thing in the world; but they are blind to it because it is an incorporeal thing, because it does not come beneath the sight of the eyes, and for this reason it is counted a very cheap thing\u2014nay, of almost no value at all.","We must limit the running to and fro which most men practise, rambling about houses, theatres, and marketplaces. They mind other men\'s business, and always seem as though they themselves had something to do. If you ask one of them as he comes out of his own door, \\"Whither are you going?\\" he will answer, \\"By Hercules, I do not know: but I shall see some people and do something.\\" They wander purposelessly seeking for something to do, and do, not what they have made up their minds to do, but what has casually fallen in their way. They move uselessly and without any plan, just like ants crawling over bushes, which creep up to the top and then down to the bottom again without gaining anything. Many men spend their lives in exactly the same fashion, which one may call a state of restless indolence.","The acquisition of riches has been for many men, not an end, but a change, of troubles.","Those who forget the past, ignore the present, and fear for the future have a life that is very brief and filled with anxiety: when they come to face death, the wretches understand too late that for such a long time they have busied themselves in doing nothing.","Nothing satisfies greed, but even a little satisfies nature.","Of all men only those who find time for philosophy are at leisure, only they are truly alive; for it is not only their own lifetime they guard well; they add every age to their own; all the years that have passed before them they requisition for their store.","Spurn everything that is added by way of decoration and display by unneccesary labour. Relect that nothing merits admiration except the spirit, the impressiveness of which prevents it from being impressed by anything.","Time heals what reason cannot.","No one can live happily who has regard for himself alone and transforms everything into a question of his own utility","\u041f\u043e\u043a\u0430\u0436\u0438 \u043c\u043d\u0435, \u043a\u0442\u043e \u043d\u0435 \u0440\u0430\u0431. \u041e\u0434\u0438\u043d \u0432 \u0440\u0430\u0431\u0441\u0442\u0432\u0435 \u0443 \u043f\u043e\u0445\u043e\u0442\u0438, \u0434\u0440\u0443\u0433\u043e\u0439 - \u0443 \u0441\u043a\u0443\u043f\u043e\u0441\u0442\u0438, \u0442\u0440\u0435\u0442\u0438\u0439 - \u0443 \u0447\u0435\u0441\u0442\u043e\u043b\u044e\u0431\u0438\u044f \u0438 \u0432\u0441\u0435 - \u0443 \u0441\u0442\u0440\u0430\u0445\u0430.","I do not regard a man as poor, if the little which remains is enough for him.","Be aware, then, that every human condition is subject to change, and that whatever mishap can befall any man can also happen to you.","And so, if only we are willing to withdraw our necks from the yoke, we can keep as stout a heart against such terrors as these. But first and foremost, we must reject pleasures; they render us weak and womanish; they make great demands upon us, and, moreover, cause us to make great demands upon Fortune. Second, we must spurn wealth: wealth is the diploma of slavery. Abandon gold and silver, and whatever else is a burden upon our richly-furnished homes; liberty cannot be gained for nothing. If you set a high value on liberty, you must set a low value on everything else.","The man who has anticipated the coming of troubles takes away their power when they arrive.","In consequence, when the pleasures have been removed which busy people derive from their actual activities, the mind cannot endure the house, the solitude, the walls, and hates to observe its own isolation. From this arises that boredom and self-dissatisfaction, that turmoil of a restless mind and gloomy and grudging endurance of our leisure, especially when we are ashamed to admit the reasons for it and our sense of shame drives the agony inward, and our desires are trapped in narrow bounds without escape and stifle themselves. From this arise melancholy and mourning and a thousand vacillations of a wavering mind, buoyed up by the birth of hope and sickened by the death of it. From this arises the state of mind of those who loathe their own leisure and complain that they have nothing to do, and the bitterest envy at the promotion of others. For unproductive idleness nurtures malice, and because they themselves could not prosper they want everyone else to be ruined. Then from this dislike of others\' success and despair of their own, their minds become enraged against fortune, complain about the times, retreat into obscurity, and brood over their own sufferings until they become sick and tired of themselves.","Furthermore, if you will pay close heed to the problem, you will find that the largest portion of our life passes while we are doing ill, a goodly share while we are doing nothing, and the whole while we are doing that which is not to the purpose.","\u064a\u062c\u0628 \u0639\u062f\u0645 \u0627\u0644\u0645\u062d\u0627\u0641\u0638\u0629 \u0639\u0644\u0649 \u062d\u064a\u0627\u0629 \u064a\u0634\u0639\u0631 \u0627\u0644\u0627\u0646\u0633\u0627\u0646 \u0628\u0627\u0644\u062e\u062c\u0644 \u0644\u0642\u0628\u0648\u0644\u0647\u0627.","Iniquum est collapsis manum non porrigere: commune hoc ius generis humani est\\"(It is wrong not to stretch out your hand to the fallen: that is a common law of the human race)","the man who spends all his time on his own needs, who organizes every day as though it were his last, neither longs for nor fears the next day.","Restless people often pretend to be calm.","we deceive ourselves in thinking that death only follows life whereas it both goes before and will follow after it for where is the difference in not beginning or ceasing to exist the effect of both is not to be","Errare humanum est, sed in errore perseverare diabolicum.","What good does it do you to go overseas, to move from city to city?

More accurately, he has existed long.","Omnes feriunt, ultima necat.","To come back to the question, the wise man, self-sufficient as he is, still desires to have a friend if only for the purpose of practising friendship and ensuring that those talents are not idle. Not, as Epicurus put it in the same letter, \u2018for the purpose of having someone to come and sit beside his bed when he is ill or come to his rescue when he is hard up or thrown into chains\u2019, but so that on the contrary he may have someone by whose sickbed he himself may sit or whom he may himself release when that person is held prisoner by hostile hands. Anyone thinking of his own interests and seeking out friendship with this in view is making a great mistake. Things will end as they began; he has secured a friend who is going to come to his aid if captivity threatens: at the first clank of a chain that friend will disappear. These are what are commonly called fair-weather friendships. A person adopted as a friend for the sake of his usefulness will be cultivated only for so long as he is useful. This explains the crowd of friends that clusters about successful men and the lonely atmosphere about the ruined \u2013 their friends running away when it comes to the testing point; it explains the countless scandalous instances of people deserting or betraying others out of fear for themselves. The ending inevitably matches the beginning: a person who starts being friends with you because it pays him will similarly cease to be friends because it pays him to do so. If there is anything in a particular friendship that attracts a man other than the friendship itself, the attraction of some reward or other will counterbalance that of the friendship. What is my object in making a friend? To have someone to be able to die for, someone I may follow into exile, someone for whose life I may put myself up as security and pay the price as well. The thing you describe is not friendship but a business deal, looking to the likely consequences, with advantage as its goal. There can be no doubt that the desire lovers have for each other is not so very different from friendship \u2013 you might say it was friendship gone mad. Well, then, does anyone ever fall in love with a view to a profit, or advancement, or celebrity? Actual love in itself, heedless of all other considerations, inflames people\u2019s hearts with a passion for the beautiful object, not without the hope, too, that the affection will be mutual. How then can the nobler stimulus of friendship be associated with any ignoble desire?","Ubicumque ex aequo ad caelum erigitur acies, paribus intervallis omnia divina ab omnibus humanis distant - From whatever point on the earth\'s surface you look up to heaven the same distance lies between the realms of gods and men","The best compromise between love and good sense is both to feel longing and to conquer it.","Kings hate to hear the things they order spoken.","judge a man after they have made him their friend, instead of making him their friend after they have judged him.

Speak as boldly with him as with yourself.","all men they alone are at leisure who take time for philosophy, they alone really live; for they are not content to be good guardians of their own lifetime only. They take from every age to add to their own; all the years that have gone before them are an addition to their store. Unless we are most ungrateful, all those men, glorious tailors of holy thoughts, were born for us; for us they have prepared a way of life. By other men\'s labours we are led to the sight of things most beautiful that have been wrestled from darkness and brought into light; from no age are we shut out, we have access to all ages, and if it is our wish, by greatness of mind, to pass beyond the narrow limits of human weakness, there is a great stretch of time through which we may roam. We may argue with Socrates, we may doubt with Carneades, find peace with Epicurus, overcome human nature with the Stoics, exceed it with the Cynics. Since Nature allows us to enter into fellowship with every age, why should we not turn from this small and fleeting span of time and surrender ourselves with all our soul to the past, which is boundless, which","Turannius was an old man who, after he turned ninety, was released from his official duties by an act of Caesar.

Hard to believe that a man could become so bored as to get a thrill out of being dead for a few days.","After friendship is formed you must trust, but before that you must judge.","For this is what makes us wicked: that no one of us looks back over his own life.

Nothing, Lucilius, is ours, except time. We were entrusted by nature with the ownership of this single thing, so fleeting and slippery that anyone who will can oust us from possession.

They keep themselves very busily engaged in order that they may be able to live better; they spend life in making ready to live! They form their purposes with a view to the distant future; yet postponement is the greatest waste of life; it deprives them of each day as it comes, it snatches from them the present by promising something hereafter. The greatest hindrance to living is expectancy, which depends upon the morrow and wastes to-day. You dispose of that which lies in the hands of Fortune, you let go that which lies in your own. Whither do you look? At what goal do you aim? All things that are still to come lie in uncertainty; live straightway!","The poet speaks to you about the day, and about this very day that is flying. Is there, then, any doubt that for hapless mortals, that is, for men who are engrossed, the fairest day is ever the first to flee? Old age surprises them while their minds are still childish, and they come to it unprepared and unarmed, for they have made no provision for it; they have stumbled upon it suddenly and unexpectedly, they did not notice that it was drawing nearer day by day. Even as conversation or reading or deep meditation on some subject beguiles the traveller, and he finds that he has reached the end of his journey before he was aware that he was approaching it, just so with this unceasing and most swift journey of life, which we make at the same pace whether waking or sleeping; those who are engrossed become aware of it only at the end.","It does not make any difference what a man say; what matters is how he feels, and not how he feels on one particular day but how he feels at all times.","It is so, my dear Lucilius; there are a few men whom slavery holds fast, but there are many more who hold fast to slavery.","Only the wise man is content with what is his.

It\'s not activity that disturbs people, but false conceptions of things that drive them mad.","Men do not let anyone seize their estates, and if there is the slightest dispute about their boundaries they rush to stones and arms; but they allow others to encroach on their lives \u2013 why, they themselves even invite in those who will take over their lives.","we should often withdraw into ourselves; for mixing with persons of dissimilar natures throws into disorder our settled composure and wakens our passions anew, exacerbating whatever is weak in the mind and not properly healed.","Who can doubt, my dear Lucilius, that life is the gift of the immortal gods, but that living well1 is the gift of philosophy?","It is not that we have a short time to live, but that we waste a lot of it. Life is long enough, and a sufficiently generous amount has been given to us for the highest achievements if it were all well invested.","Poor woman, do you want to know where hatred ends? Look to love.","The first thing which philosophy undertakes to give is fellow-feeling with all men; in other words, sympathy and sociability.","NUTRICE: dove corri,figlia, lontano dalla tua casa?

For I have sold myself to no man; I bear the name of no master. I give much credit to the judgment of great men; but I claim something also for my own. For these men, too, have left to us, not positive discoveries, but problems whose solution is still to be sought.","Do you think that the man has any thought of mending his ways who counts over his vices as if they were virtues? Therefore, as far as possible, prove yourself guilty, hunt up charges against yourself; play the part, first of accuser, then of judge, last of intercessor. At times be harsh with yourself.[7]","To be everywhere; is to be nowhere.","Every pleasure is most valued when it is coming to an end.","Therefore, according to the disposition of the state and the liberty Fortune allows us, we shall either extend or contract our activities; but at all events we shall stir ourselves and not be gripped and paralyzed by fear. He indeed will prove a man who, threatened by dangers on all sides, with arms and chains clattering around him, will neither endanger nor conceal his courage: for self-preservation does not entail suppressing onself. Truly, I believe, Curius Dentatus used to say that he preferred real death to living death; for the ultimate horror is to leave the number of the living before you die.","What is the state of things, then? It is this: I do not regard a man as poor, if the little which remains is enough for him. I advise you, however, to keep what is really yours; and you cannot begin too early. For, as our ancestors believed, it is too late to spare when you reach the dregs of the cask.[1] Of that which remains at the bottom, the amount is slight, and the quality is vile. Farewell.","Do you ask what is the foundation of a sound mind? It is, not to find joy in useless things.","The wise man will not upset the customs of the people, nor will he invite the attention of the populace by any novel ways of living.","For what good does it do us to guide a horse and control his speed with the curb, and then find that our own passions, utterly uncurbed, bolt with us? Or to beat many opponents in wrestling or boxing, and then to find that we ourselves are beaten by anger?","The duty of a man is to be useful to his fellow-men; if possible, to be useful to many of them; failing this, to be useful to a few; failing this, to be useful to his neighbours, and, failing them, to himself: for when he helps others, he advances the general interests of mankind. Just as he who makes himself a worse man does harm not only to himself but to all those to whom he might have done good if he had made himself a better one, so he who deserves well of himself does good to others by the very fact that he is preparing what will be of service to them.","[I]ndulge the body just so far as suffices for good health. It needs to be treated somewhat strictly to prevent it from being disobedient to the spirit. Your food should appease your hunger, your drink quench your thirst, your clothing keep out the cold, your house be a protection against inclement weather.","[C]ling tooth and nail to the following rule: not to give in to adversity, never to trust prosperity, and always take full not of fortune\'s habit of behaving just as she pleases, treating her as if she were actually going to do everything it is in her power to do.","Those who are busy with other things do not notice it until the end comes.","Do you ask what is the proper limit to wealth? It is, first, to have what is necessary, and, second, to have what is enough.","We are born under circumstances that would be favorable if we did not abandon them. It was nature\'s intention that there should be no need of great equipment for a good life: every individual can make himself happy.","Pacuvius, who by long occupancy made Syria his own,8 used to hold a regular burial sacrifice in his own honour, with wine and the usual funeral feasting, and then would have himself carried from the dining-room to his chamber, while eunuchs applauded and sang in Greek to a musical accompaniment: \\"He has lived his life, he has lived his life!","Part of my joy in learning is that it puts me in a position to teach; nothing, however outstanding and however helpful, will ever give me any pleasure if the knowledge is for my benefit alone.","Sine philosophia nemo intrepide potest vivere, nemo secure.","Virtue is according to nature; vice is opposed to it and hostile.","Most human beings, Paulinus, complain about the meanness of nature, because we are born for a brief span of life, and because this spell of time that has been given to us rushes by so swiftly and rapidly that with very few exceptions life ceases for the rest of us just when we are getting ready for it.","We shall consider later whether these evils derive their power from their own strength, or from our own weakness.","set yourself free for your own sake; gather and save your time, which till lately has been forced from you, or filched away, or has merely slipped from your hands. Make yourself believe the truth of my words, - that certain moments are torn from us, that some are gently removed, and that others glide beyond our reach. The most disgraceful kind of loss, however, is that due to carelessness. Furthermore, if you will pay close heed to the problem, you will find that the largest portion of our life passes while we are doing ill, a goodly share while we are doing nothing, and the whole while we are doing that which is not to the purpose. 2. What man can you show me who places any value on his time, who reckons the worth of each day, who understands that he is dying daily? For we are mistaken when we look forward to death; the major portion of death has already passed. Whatever years be behind us are in death\'s hands.","No man can have a peaceful life who thinks too much about lengthening it, or believes that living through many consulships is a great blessing. 5. Rehearse this thought every day, that you may be able to depart from life contentedly; for many men clutch and cling to life, even as those who are carried down a rushing stream clutch and cling to briars and sharp rocks.","For if we could be satisfied with anything, we should have been satisfied long ago.","Therefore, nothing ought to be unexpected by us. Our minds should be sent forward in advance to meet all problems, and we should consider, not what is wont to happen, but what can happen.","You are living as if destined to live for ever; your own frailty never occurs to you; you don\u2019t notice how much time has already passed, but squander it as though you had a full and overflowing supply \u2013 though all the while that very day which you are devoting to somebody or something may be your last. You act like mortals in all that you fear, and like immortals in all that you desire.","We should not manifest surprise at any sort of condition into which we are born, and which should be lamented by no one, simply because it is equally ordained for all. Yes, I say, equally ordained; for a man might have experienced even that which he has escaped. And an equal law consists, not of that which all have experienced, but of that which is laid down for all. Be sure to prescribe for your mind this sense of equity; we should pay without complaint the tax of our mortality.","You complain that there is an undersupply of books where you are. What matters is not how many you have but how good they are. Varied reading gives pleasure; selective reading does real good.","We must, therefore, take a less serious view of all things, tolerating them in a spirit of acceptance: It is more human to laugh at life than to weep tears over it.","[E]verything which went beyond our actual needs was just so much unnecessary weight, a burden to the man who had to carry it.","Unbroken prosperity cannot bear a single blow; but he who has waged an unceasing strife with his misfortunes has gained a thicker skin by his sufferings, yields to no disaster, and even though he fall yet fights on his knee.","All the greatest blessings are a source of anxiety, and at no time is fortune less wisely trusted than when it is best","The fool\'s life is empty of gratitude and full of fears; its course lies wholly toward the future.","In sapientis quoque animo, etiam cum uulnus sanatum est, cicatrix manet.\\" : \\"The wise man\'s mind will keep its scar long after the wound has healed","do the one thing that can render you really happy: cast aside and trample under foot all the things that glitter outwardly and are held out to you a by another or as obtainable from another;","How long will this last?\u2019 This feeling has caused kings to bewail their power, and they were not so much delighted by the greatness of their fortune as terrified by the thought of its inevitable end.","The man who fears death will never do anything worthy of a man who is alive; but he who knows that these were the conditions drawn up for him when he was conceived will live according to this rule and at the same time, through the same strength of mind, he will ensure that none of what happens to him will come unexpectedly.","The one to whom nothing was refused, whose tears were always wiped away by an anxious mother, will not abide being offended.\u2014De Ira 2.21.6","\u0645\u0627 \u0623\u0635\u0639\u0628 \u0623\u0646 \u062a\u062a\u062e\u0644\u0635 \u0627\u0644\u0646\u0641\u0633 \u0645\u0646 \u0627\u0644\u063a\u0636\u0628 \u0628\u0639\u062f \u0623\u0646 \u062a\u064f\u062f\u0641\u0639 \u0625\u0644\u064a\u0647.","A man should therefore grow accustomed to his state and complain about it as little as possible, seizing upon whatever good it may have.","\u0645\u0646 \u064a\u0633\u062a\u0641\u064a\u062f \u0645\u0646 \u062c\u0631\u064a\u0645\u0629 \u0641\u0647\u0648 \u0641\u0627\u0639\u0644\u0647\u0627.","No condition is so distressing that a balanced mind cannot find some comfort in it.","by foreseeing anything that can happen as though it will happen he will soften the onslaught of all his troubles, which present no surprises to those who are ready and waiting for them, but fall heavily on those who are careless in the expectation that all will be well.","The happy man is satisfied with his present situation, no matter what it is, and eyes his fortune with contentment; the happy man is the one who permits reason to evaluate every condition of his existence.","The most important contribution to peace of mind is never to do wrong. Those who lack self-control lead disturbed and tumultuous lives; their crimes are balanced by their fears, and they are never at ease.","We do not need many words, but, rather, effective words.","Anger will abate and become more controlled when it knows it must come before a judge each day.","\u0627\u0644\u0643\u0648\u0631\u0633 : \u0628\u0623\u064a \u062e\u062f\u064a\u0639\u0629 \u0642\u064f\u0636\u064a \u0639\u0644\u064a\u0647\u0645\u0627 \u061f\u0627\u0644\u0631\u0633\u0648\u0644 : \u0643\u0645\u0627 \u0647\u064a \u0627\u0644\u0639\u0627\u062f\u0629 \u0641\u064a \u0627\u0644\u0642\u0636\u0627\u0621 \u0639\u0644\u0649 \u0627\u0644\u0645\u0644\u0648\u0643 . \u0628\u0627\u0644\u0647\u062f\u0627\u064a\u0627.","They are all in the same category, both those who are afflicted with fickleness, boredom and a ceaseless change of purpose, and who always yearn for what they left behind, and those who just yawn from apathy. There are those too who toss around like insomniacs, and keep changing their position until they find rest through sheer weariness. They keep altering the condition of their lives, and eventually stick to that one in which they are trapped not by weariness with further change but by old age which is too sluggish for novelty. There are those too who suffer not from moral steadfastness but from inertia, and so lack the fickleness to live as they wish, and just live as they have begun. In fact there are innumerable characteristics of the malady, but one effect - dissatisfaction with oneself. This arises from mental instability and from fearful and unfulfilled desires, when men do not dare or do not achieve all they long for, and all they grasp at is hope: they are always unbalanced and fickle, an inevitable consequence of living in suspense. They struggle to gain their prayers by every path, and they teach and force themselves to do dishonourable and difficult things; and when their efforts are unrewarded the fruitless disgrace tortures them, and they regret not the wickedness but the frustration of their desires. Then they are gripped by repentance for their attempt and fear of trying again, and they are undermined by the restlessness of a mind that can discover no outlet, because they can neither control nor obey their desires, by the dithering of life that cannot see its way ahead, and by the lethargy of a soul stagnating amid its abandoned hopes.","we are not given a short life but we make it short, and we are not ill-supplied but wasteful of it.","Your ears are not simply for hearing tuneful sounds, mellow and sweetly played in harmony: you should also listen to laughter and weeping, to words flattering and acrimonious, to merriment and distress, to the language of men and to the roars and barking of animals.","Quam bene vivas refert, non quam diu","There is nothing after death; and death is nothing - only the finishing post of life\'s short race. Ambitious, give up your hopes; anxious, your fears. Vast Chaos, and the hungry mouth of Time, consume us all. Death is inseparable; it destroys the body, and does not spare the soul. For Taenarus - the realm of the grim king - the jealous hound that guards the infernal gate - these are all idle tales, fables, the stories of a troubled dream. You ask, where will you be when you are dead? Where the unborn are.","I realize that these mental agitations of mine are not dangerous and won\u2019t produce a storm. To express my complaint for you in a realistic metaphor, I am harried not by a tempest but by sea-sickness.","I am often filled with wonder when I see some men demanding the time of others and those from whom they ask it most indulgent. Both of them fix their eyes on the object of the request for time, neither of them on the time itself; just as if what is asked were nothing, what is given, nothing. Men trifle with the most precious thing in the world; but they are blind to it because it is an incorporeal thing, because it does not come beneath the sight of the eyes, and for this reason it is counted a very cheap thing\u2014nay, of almost no value at all.","why should I demand of Fortune that she give rather than demand of myself that I should not crave?","It is fair to say that those who make Zeno, Pythagoras, Democritus and other giants of philosophy their daily companions will be more fully engaged in a rewarding life. None of these friends will be too busy to welcome you inside their home, none will fail to leave his caller feeling refreshed after an appointment. Any man can spend time with them day or night.","No man is despised by another unless he is first despised by himself. An abject and debased mind is susceptible to such insult; but if a man stirs himself to face the worst of disasters and defeats the evils which overwhelm others, then he wears those very sorrows like a sacred badge. For we are naturally disposed to admire more than anything else the man who shows fortitude in adversity.","It is shameful to hate a person who deserves your praises; but how much more shameful it is to hate someone for the very cause that makes him deserve your pity.","Beasts avoid the dangers which they see, and when they have escaped them are free from care; but we men torment ourselves over that which is to come as well as over that which is past. Many of our blessings bring bane to us; for memory recalls the tortures of fear, while foresight anticipates them. The present alone can make no man wretched. Farewell.","How much better would it now be to win friends, pacify enemies, serve your country, turn your attention to private affairs, than to look around to see what harm you can do to some individual, what wound you can inflict on his good name, or his finances, or his person, though you cannot achieve this end without a dangerous struggle, even if your opponent is lower-born than you!","[T]he man who spends his time choosing one resort after another in a hunt for peace and quiet, will in every place he visits find something to prevent him from relaxing. The story is told that someone complained to Socrates that travelling abroad had never done him any good and received the reply: \\"What else can you expect, seeing that you always take yourself along with you when you go abroad?\u201f","It is precisely in times of immunity from care that the soul should toughen itself beforehand for occasions of greater stress, and it is while Fortune is kind that it should fortify itself against her violence.","Es ist nicht wenig Zeit, die wir haben, sondern es ist viel Zeit, die wir nicht nutzen.","vita nec bonum nec malum est.","For how little have we lost, when the two finest things of all will accompany us wherever we go, universal nature and our individual virtue. Believe me, this was the intention of whoever formed the universe, whether all-powerful god, or incorporeal reason creating mighty works, or divine spirit penetrating all things from greatest to smallest with even pressure, or fate and the unchanging sequence of causation - this, I say, was the intention, that only the most worthless of our possessions should come into the power of another. Whatever is best for a human being lies outside human control: it can be neither given nor taken away.","it is not pleasant to recall something they must view with regret. They are, therefore, unwilling to direct their thoughts backward to illspenthours, and those whose vices become obvious if they review the past, even the vices which were disguised under some allurement of momentary pleasure, do not have the courage to revert to those hours. No one willingly turns his thought back to the past, unless all his acts have been submitted to the censorship of hisconscience, which is never deceived; he who has ambitiously coveted, proudly scorned, recklessly conquered, treacherously betrayed, greedily seized, or lavishly squandered, must needs fear his own memory.","philosophy teaches us to act, not to speak; it exacts of every man that he should live according to his own standards, that his life should not be out of harmony with his words, and that, further, his inner life should be of one hue and not out of harmony with all his activities.","We always feel anger longer than we feel hurt.","1. What is this force, Lucilius, that drags us in one direction when we are aiming in another, urging us on to the exact place from which we long to withdraw? What is it that wrestles with our spirit, and does not allow us to desire anything once for all? We veer from plan to plan. None of our wishes is free, none is unqualified, none is lasting. 2. \\"But it is the fool,\\" you say, \\"who is inconsistent; nothing suits him for long.\\" But how or when can we tear ourselves away from this folly? No man by himself has sufficient strength to rise above it; he needs a helping hand, and some one to extricate him. 3. Epicurus remarks that certain men have worked their way to the truth without any one\'s assistance, carving out their own passage. And he gives special praise to these, for their impulse has come from within, and they have forged to the front by themselves. Again, he says, there are others who need outside help, who will not proceed unless someone leads the way, but who will follow faithfully. Of these, he says, Metrodorus was one; this type of man is also excellent, but belongs to the second grade. We ourselves are not of that first class, either; we shall be well treated if we are admitted into the second. Nor need you despise a man who can gain salvation only with the assistance of another; the will to be saved means a great deal, too. 4. You will find still another class of man, \u2013 and a class not to be despised, \u2013 who can be forced and driven into righteousness, who do not need a guide as much as they require someone to encourage and, as it were, to force them along. This is the third variety. If you ask me for a man of this pattern also, Epicurus tells us that Hermarchus was such. And of the two last-named classes, he is more ready to congratulate the one, but he feels more respect for the other; for although both reached the same goal, it is a greater credit to have brought about the same result with the more difficult material upon which to work.","longa est vita si plena est.","You have all the fears of mortals and all the desires of immortals.","To lose someone you love is something you\'ll regard as the hardest of all blows to bear, while all the time this will be as silly as crying because the leaves fall from the beautiful trees that add to the charm of your home.[...] At one moment chance will carry off one of them, at another moment another; but the falling of the leaves is not difficult to bear, since they grow again, and it is no more hard to bear the loss of those whom you love and regard as brightening your existence; for even if they do not grow again they are replaced. \\"But their successors will never be quite the same.\\" No, and neither will you.","Heaven knows!\xa0 such lives as yours, though they should pass the limit of a thousand years, will shrink into the merest span; your vices will swallow up any amount of time.\xa0 The space you have, which reason can prolong, although it naturally hurries away, of necessity escapes from you quickly; for you do not seize it, you neither hold it back, nor impose delay upon the swiftest thing in the world, but you allow it to slip away as if it were something superfluous and that could be replaced.","Different reasons roused different peoples to leave their homes; but this at least is clear, nothing has stayed where it was born. The human race is always on the move:","He who has learned to die has unlearned slavery; he is above any external power, or, at any rate, he is beyond it. What terrors have prisons and bonds and bars for him? His way out is clear.

Life is long enough, and it has been given in sufficiently generous measure to allow the accomplishment of the very greatest things if the whole of it is well invested. But when it is squandered in luxury and carelessness, when it is devoted to no good end, forced at last by the ultimate necessity we perceive that it has passed away before we were aware that it was passing. So it is\u2014the life we receive is not short, but we make it so, nor do we have any lack of it, but are wasteful of it. Just as great and princely wealth is scattered in a moment when it comes into the hands of a bad owner, while wealth however limited, if it is entrusted to a good guardian, increases by use, so our life is amply long for him who orders it properly.","El\xe4m\xe4 avautuu suurena sille, joka osaa j\xe4rjest\xe4\xe4 sen viisaasti.","Am I not to inquire into the identity of the artist of this universe?","Perhaps it will come, perhaps not; in the meantime it is not.

We are all held in the same captivity, and those who have bound others are themselves in bonds - unless you think perhaps that the left-hand chain is lighter. One man is bound by high office, another by wealth; good birth weighsdown some, and a humble origin others; some bowunder the rule of other men and some under their own; some are restricted to one place by exile, others by priesthoods: all life is a servitude.","He that owns himself has lost nothing. But how few men are blessed with ownership of self!","You must reflect carefully beforehand with whom you are to eat and drink, rather than what you are to eat and drink.

That man is happiest, and is secure in his own possession of himself, who can await the morrow without apprehension. When a man has said: \\"I have lived!\\", every morning he arises he receives a bonus.","for when one strays away from Nature one is compelled to crave, and fear, and be a slave to the things of chance.","He will have many masters who makes his body his master, who is over-fearful in its behalf, who judges everything according to the body.","he is most powerful who has power over himself.","Every man, when he first sees light, is commanded to be content with milk and rags. Such is our beginning, and yet kingdoms are all too small for us!","But life is very short and anxious for those who forget the past, neglect the present, and fear the future. When they come to the end of it, the poor wretches realize too late that for all this time they have been preoccupied in doing nothing.","we never expect that any evil will befall ourselves before it comes, we will not be taught by seeing the misfortunes of others that they are the common inheritance of all men, but imagine that the path which we have begun to tread is free from them and less beset by dangers than that of other people. How many funerals pass our houses? Yet we do not think of death.","In a word, do you want to know how briefly they really live? See how keen they are to live a long life. Enfeebled old men beg in their prayers for an additional few years; they pretend they are younger than they really are; they flatter themselves by this falsehood, and deceive themselves as gladly as if they deceived fate at the same time. But when some real illness has at last reminded them that they are mortal, how terrified they are when they die, as if they\'re not leaving life but are being dragged from it! They cry out repeatedly that they\'ve been fools because they\'ve not really lived, and that they\'ll live in leisure if only they escape their illness. Then they reflect on how uselessly they made provision for things they wouldn\'t live to enjoy, and how fruitless was all their toil.","The amount of life we truly live is small. For our existence on Earth is not Life, but merely Time.","How can you think that anything will not happen, when you know that it may happen to many men, and has happened to many? That is a noble verse, and worthy of a nobler source than the stage:\u2014 \\"What one hath suffered may befall us all.\\" That man has lost his children: you may lose yours. That man has been convicted: your innocence is in peril. We are deceived and weakened by this delusion, when we suffer what we never foresaw that we possibly could suffer: but by looking forward to the coming of our sorrows we take the sting out of them when they come.","Thus the time we are given is not brief, but we make it so. We do not lack time; on the contrary, there is so much of it that we waste an awful lot.","Why, indeed, is it necessary to summon trouble, \u2013 which must be endured soon enough when it has once arrived, or to anticipate trouble and ruin the present through fear of the future? It is indeed foolish to be unhappy now because you may be unhappy at some future time. 2.","A multitude of books only gets in one\'s way. So if you are unable to read all the books in your possession, you have enough when you have all the books you are able to read.","no one can merely go wrong by himself, but he must become both the cause and adviser of another\'s wrong doing.","No one willingly turns his thought back to the past, unless all his acts have been submitted to the censorship of his conscience, which is never deceived; he who has ambitiously coveted, proudly scorned, recklessly conquered, treacherously betrayed, greedily seized, or lavishly squandered, must needs fear his own memory.","What is the harm in returning to the point whence you came? He will live badly who does not know how to die well. So we must first strip off the value we set on this thing and reckon the breath of life as something cheap. To quote Cicero, we hate gladiatorsif they are keen to save their life by any means; we favour them if they openly show contempt for it.","but the most wretched are those who are toiling not even at their own preoccupations, but must regulate their sleep by another\u2019s, and their walk by another\u2019s pace, and obey orders in those freest of all things, loving and hating. If such people want to know how short their lives are, let them reflect how small a portion is their own.","We are indeed apt to ascribe certain faults to the place or to the time; but those faults will follow us, no matter how we change our place.\xa0 You","No man is born rich. Every man, when he first sees light, is commanded to be content with milk and rags. Such is our beginning, and yet kingdoms are all too small for us!","For men cease to possess all things the moment they desire all things for their own.","All things that Fortune looks upon become productive and pleasant, only if he who possesses them is in possession also of himself, and is not in the power of that which belongs to him.","No nos da miedo hacer las cosas porque sean dif\xedciles, sino que las cosas son dif\xedciles porque nos da miedo hacerlas.","No man finds it difficult to return to nature, except the man who has deserted nature.\xa0 We","Counting even yesterday, all past time is lost time; the very day which we are now spending is shared between ourselves and death. It is not the last drop that empties the water-clock, but all that which previously has flowed out; similarly, the final hour when we cease to exist does not of itself bring death; it merely of itself completes the death-process. We reach death at that moment, but we have been a long time on the way. 21.","You have all the fears of mortals and all the desires of immortals","For the soul is more powerful than any sort of Fortune; by its own agency it guides its affairs in either direction, and of its own power it can produce a happy life, or a wretched one.","all the works of mortal man have been doomed to mortality, and in the midst of things which have been destined to die, we live!","the other vices seize individuals, this is the one passion that sometimes takes hold of an entire state. Never has an entire people burned with love for a woman, no state in its entirety has placed its hope in money or profit; ambition seizes men one by one on a personal basis, lack of self-restraint does not afflict a whole people; often they rush to anger in one mass.","We ought frequently to remind ourselves that we must love the things of this life as we would what is shortly to leave us, or indeed in the very act of leaving us.","Consider individuals, survey men in general; there is none whose life does not look forward to the morrow. \u201cWhat harm is there in this, you ask? Infinite harm; for such persons do not live, but are preparing to live. They postpone everything. Even if we paid strict attention, life would soon get ahead of us; but as we are now, life finds us lingering and passes us by as if it belonged to another, and though it ends on the final day, it perishes every day.\u201d","How many have laid waste to your life when you weren\u2019t aware of what you were losing, how much was wasted in pointless grief, foolish joy, greedy desire, and social amusements\u2014how little of your own was left to you. You will realize you are dying before your time!","It is tragic for the soul to be apprehensive of the future and wretched in anticipation of wretchedness, consumed with an anxious desire that the objects which give pleasure may remain in its possession to the very end. For such a soul will never be at rest; in waiting for the future it will lose the present blessings which it might enjoy.","Pobre n\xe3o \xe9 aquele que tem pouco, mas antes aquele que muito deseja.","Meanwhile, as they rob and are robbed, as they disturb each other\u2019s peace, as they make each other miserable, their lives pass without satisfaction, without pleasure, without mental improvement.","The many speak highly of you, but have you really any grounds for satisfaction with yourself if you are the kind of person the many understand? Your merits should not be outward facing.","Epicurus will oblige me with these words:[4] \\"Think on death,\\" or rather, if you prefer the phrase, on \\"migration to heaven.\\" 9. The meaning is clear, \u2013 that it is a wonderful thing to learn thoroughly how to die. You may deem it superfluous to learn a text that can be used only once; but that is just the reason why we ought to think on a thing. When we can never prove whether we really know a thing, we must always be learning it. 10. \\"Think on death.\\" In saying this, he bids us think on freedom. He who has learned to die has unlearned slavery; he is above any external power, or, at any rate, he is beyond it. What terrors have prisons and bonds and bars for him? His way out is clear. There is only one chain which binds us to life, and that is the love of life. The chain may not be cast off, but it may be rubbed away, so that, when necessity shall demand, nothing may retard or hinder us from being ready to do at once that which at some time we are bound to do. Farewell.","We, then, can show as spirited an attitude to just the same things if we will only choose to slip the yoke from our necks. But first we have to reject the life of pleasures; they make us soft and womanish; they are insistent in their demands, and what is more, require us to make insistent demands on fortune.","It takes the whole of life to learn how to live, and\u2014what will perhaps make you wonder more\u2014it takes the whole of life to learn how to die.","Why need we weep over parts of our life? the whole of it calls for tears: new miseries assail us before we have freed ourselves from the old ones.","Never did I trust Fortune, even when she seemed to be offering peace. All those blessings which she kindly bestowed on me \u2013 money, public office, influence \u2013 I relegated to a place from which she could take them back without disturbing me. Between them and me, I have kept a wide gap, and so she has merely taken them, not torn them from me.","Eat merely to relieve your hunger; drink merely to quench your thirst; dress merely to keep out the cold; house yourself merely as a protection against personal discomfort. It matters little whether the house be built of turf, or of variously coloured imported marble; understand that a man is sheltered just as well by a thatch as by a roof of gold.","A so-called busy man may declare the day to be endless, or may mourn how the hours crawl slowly toward dinner time, but this is no evidence that this man\u2019s life is long. For when the busy man finally has some time to himself he\u2019s left to stew in boundless boredom with nothing to do and with no clue how to fill his day. Restlessly these types seek new ways to be at leisure and the time between play needles them to no end. Their excitement peaks at the announcement of a gladiator bout or some other such spectacle and they long to skip the days that lie between now and the grand day of extravagant entertainment. Their impatient waiting for something they desire gives them the illusion that time is passing by slowly. Yet their days on Earth remain finite, even as they fritter away time bobbing from one pleasure to another. For these wasters, uneventful afternoons of no play are long and hateful. Yet a single night out drinking with a harlot seems to fly by in no time! This strange perception of the passage of time depending on one\u2019s mood and company has provided material for the poets. We have heard tales of how when Jupiter was with a lover the night he spent in her pleasant company seemed to pass twice as long. But doesn\u2019t using the story concerning a god as an example of how to make time pass longer merely encourage more human vice? Can a night that costs a man so much really be regretted by that same man for being so short? They waste the day in anticipation of the night, then spend the night worrying about the coming dawn.","The problem, Paulinus, is not that we have a short life, but that we waste time. Life is long and there is enough of it for satisfying personal accomplishments if we use our hours well. But when time is squandered in the pursuit of pleasure or in vain idleness, when it is spent with no real purpose, the finality of death fast approaches and it is only then, when we are forced to, that we, at last, take a good hard look at how we have spent our life- just as we become aware that it is ending. Thus the time we are given is not brief, but we make it so. We do not lack time; on the contrary, there is so much of it that we waste an awful lot","it is while Fortune is kind that it should fortify itself against her violence.","Let us cherish and love old age; for it is full of pleasure if one knows how to use it. Fruits are most welcome when almost over; youth is most charming at its close; the last drink delights the toper, the glass which souses him and puts the finishing touch on his drunkenness.\xa0 Each pleasure reserves to the end the greatest delights which it contains. Life is most delightful when it is on the downward slope, but has not yet reached the abrupt decline. And I myself believe that the period which stands, so to speak, on the edge of the roof, possesses pleasures of its own. Or else the very fact of our not wanting pleasures has taken the place of the pleasures themselves. How comforting it is to have tired out one\'s appetites, and to have done with them!","Believe me, it takes a great man and one who has risen far above human weaknesses not to allow any of his time to be filched from him, and it follows that the life of such a man is very long because he has devoted wholly to himself whatever time he has had. None of it lay neglected and idle; none of it was under the control of another, for, guarding it most grudgingly, he found nothing that was worthy to be taken in exchange for his time. And so that man had time enough, but those who have been robbed of much of their life by the public, have necessarily had too little of it.","Other resolutions have been broken, but after all in such a way that, in cases where I ceased to practice abstinence, I have observed a limit which is indeed next door to abstinence; perhaps it is even a little more difficult, because it is easier for the will to cut off certain things utterly than to use them with restraint.","The problem, Paulinus, is not that we have a short life, but that we waste time.","What pleasure is there in seeing new lands? Or in surveying cities and spots of interest? All your bustle is useless. Do you ask why such flight does not help you? It is because you flee along with yourself. You must lay aside the burdens of the mind; until you do this, no place willsatisfy you. [...] The person you are matters more than the place to which you go.","he who has ambitiously yearned to possess, proudly scorned, recklessly conquered, treacherously betrayed, greedily seized, or lavishly squandered, must fear his own memory.","To fight against an equal is risky; against a higher-up, insane; against someone beneath you, degrading.","Here is your noble spirit \u2013 the one which has put itself in the hands of fate; on the other side we have the puny degenerate spirit which struggles, and which sees nothing right in the way the universe is ordered, and would rather reform the gods than reform itself.","Inwardly, we ought to be different in all respects, but our exterior should conform to society.","Life is long and there is enough of it for satisfying personal accomplishments if we use our hours well.","Paucis natura contenta est","it takes a great man and one who has risen far above human weaknesses not to allow any of his time to be filched from him, and it follows that the life of such a man is very long because he has devoted wholly to himself whatever time he has had.\xa0 None of it lay neglected and idle; none of it was under the control of another, for, guarding it most grudgingly, he found nothing that was worthy to be taken in exchange for his time.","Live in this belief: \u201cI am not born for any one corner of the universe; this whole world is my country.","But,\\" comes the reply, \\"I am being driven from the farm which my father and grandfather owned!\\" Well? Who owned the land before your grandfather? Can you explain what people (I will not say what person) held it originally? You did not enter upon it as a master, but merely as a tenant. And whose tenant are you? If your claim is successful, you are tenant of the heir. The lawyers say that public property cannot be acquired privately by possession;11 what you hold and call your own is public property \u2014indeed, it belongs to mankind at large.","There is no man to whom a good mind comes before an evil one. It is the evil mind that gets first hold on all of us. Learning virtue means unlearning vice. We should therefore proceed to the task of freeing ourselves from faults with all the more courage because, when once committed to us, the good is an everlasting possession; virtue is not unlearned.","This, I say, is the highest duty and the highest proof of wisdom, \u2013 that deed and word should be in accord, that a man should be equal to himself under all conditions, and always the same.","You live as if you will live forever, no care for your mortality ever enters your head, you pay no mind to how much time has already gone by. You waste time as if it was a limitless resource, when any moment you spend on someone else or some matter is potentially your last.","Bassus may be included among these men; and he had no wish to deceive us. He says that it is as foolish to fear death as to fear old age; for death follows old age precisely as old age follows youth. He who does not wish to die cannot have wished to live. For life is granted to us with the reservation that we shall die; to this end our path leads. Therefore, how foolish it is to fear it, since men simply await that which is sure, but fear only that which is uncertain! 11. Death has its fixed rule, \u2013 equitable and unavoidable. Who can complain when he is governed by terms which include everyone? The chief part of equity, however, is equality.","He who fears death will never do anything worthy of a living man. But he who knows that this was the condition laid down for him at the moment of his conception will live on those terms, and at the same time he will guarantee with a similar strength of mind that no events take him by surprise.","There is a comeliness even in grief. This should be cultivated by the wise man; even in tears, just as in other matters also, there is a certain sufficiency; it is with the unwise that sorrows, like joys, gush over.","det ille veniam facile, cui venia est opus - the one who needs pardon should readily grant it","This saying of Stilbo makes common ground with Stoicism; the Stoic also can carry his goods unimpaired through cities that have been burned to ashes; for he is self-sufficient. Such are the bounds which he sets to his own happiness.","Of this one thing make sure against your dying day\u2014let your faults die before you die","But learning how to live takes a whole life, and, which may surprise you more, it takes a whole life to learn how to die. So many of the finest men have put aside all","A consciousness of wrongdoing is the first step to salvation.\u2019 This remark of Epicurus\u2019 is to me a very good one. For a person who is not aware that he is doing anything wrong has no desire to be put right. You have to catch yourself doing it before you can reform. Some people boast about their failings: can you imagine someone who counts his faults as merits ever giving thought to their cure?","Nessun vento \xe8 favorevole per il marinaio che non sa a quale porto vuole approdare.","Strangeness adds to the weight of calamities, and every mortal feels the greater pain as a result of that which also brings surprise.","Of all men, only those who find time for philosophy are at leisure; only they are truly alive; for it is not only their own lifetime they guard well: they add every age to their own.","At this moment the man who measures the souls of all men by his own is shaking his fist in my face because I hold that there is a parity between the goods involved in the case of one who passes sentence honourably, and of one who suffers sentence honourably; or because I hold that there is a parity between the goods of one who celebrates a triumph, and of one who, unconquered in spirit, is carried before the victor\u2019s chariot. For such critics think that whatever they themselves cannot do, is not done; they pass judgment on virtue in the light of their own weaknesses.","Some men restrict themselves at home, but strut with swelling port before the public; such discordance is a fault, and it indicates a wavering mind which cannot yet keep its balance.","For although the sum and substance of the happy life is unalloyed freedom from care, and though the secret of such freedom is unshaken confidence, yet men gather together that which causes worry, and, while travelling life\'s treacherous road, not only have burdens to bear, but even draw burdens to themselves; hence","What answer are we to make to the reflection that pleasure belongs to good and bad men alike, and that bad men take as much delight in their shame as good men in noble things?","Everyone hustles his life along, and is troubled by a longing for the future and weariness of the present. But the man who spends all his time on his own needs, who organizes every day as though it were his last, neither longs for nor fears the next day.

Both of them fix their eyes on the object of the request for time, neither of them on the time itself; just as if what is asked were nothing, what is given, nothing. Men trifle with the most precious thing in the world; but they are blind to it because it is an incorporeal thing, because it does not come beneath the sight of the eyes, and for this reason it is counted a very cheap thing\u2014nay, of almost no value at all. Men set very great store by pensions and doles, and for these they hire out their labour or service or effort. But no one sets a value on time; all use it lavishly as if it cost nothing. But see how these same people clasp the knees of physicians if they fall ill and the danger of death draws nearer, see how ready they are, if threatened with capital punishment, to spend all their possessions in order to live! So great is the inconsistency of their feelings. But if each one could have the number of his future years set before him as is possible in the case of the years that have passed, how alarmed those would be who saw only a few remaining, how sparing of them would they be! And yet it is easy to dispense an amount that is assured, no matter how small it may be; but that must be guarded more carefully which will fail you know not when.","There is no need to complain of particular grievances, for life in its entirety is lamentable.","Saiba que um teto de palha abriga o homem t\xe3o bem quanto o de ouro.","Do you wish to know how different the position is in which we place them?

He, a leader of the state and one who, according to report, was conspicuous among the leaders28 of old for the kindness of his heart, thought it a notable kind of spectacle to kill human beings after a new fashion. Do they fight to the death? That is not enough! Are they torn to pieces? That is not enough! Let them be crushed by animals of monstrous bulk! Better would it be that these things pass into oblivion lest hereafter some all-powerful man should learn them and be jealous of an act that was nowise human.29 O, what blindness does great prosperity cast upon our minds! When he was casting so many troops of wretched human beings to wild beasts born under a different sky, when he was proclaiming war between creatures so ill matched, when he was shedding so much blood before the eyes of the Roman people, who itself was soon to be forced to shed more. he then believed that he was beyond the power of Nature. But later this same man, betrayed by Alexandrine treachery, offered himself to the dagger of the vilest slave, and then at last discovered what an empty boast his surname30 was.","Where, then, lies the mistake, since all men crave the happy life? It is that they regard the means for producing happiness as happiness itself, and, while seeking happiness, they are really fleeing from it.","Whatever years be behind us are in death\'s hands.","In death there is nothing harmful; for there must exist something to which it is harmful. [And since after death we do not exist, death cannot be harmful to us. Seneca has in mind the argument of Epicurus (Diogenes Laertius, x. 124-5): \\"Therefore the most dread-inspiring of all evils, death, is nothing to us; for when we exist; death is not present in us, and when death is present, then we do not exist. Therefore it does not concern either the living or the dead; for to the living it has no existence, and the dead do not themselves exist.","there can be no place of exile within the world since nothing within the world is alien to men.","Prosperity is a turbulent thing; it torments itself. It stirs the brain in more ways than one, goading men on to various aims\u2014some to power, and others to high living. Some it puffs up; others it slackens and wholly enervates. \u201cBut, the retort comes, \u201cso-and-so carries his prosperity well.\u201d Yes; just as he carries his liquor. So you need not let this class of men persuade you that one who is besieged by the crowd is happy; they run to him as crowds rush for a pool of water, rendering it muddy while they drain it.\u201d","Death\'s terrors are for him who, too well known, will die a stranger to himself alone.","the wise man regards the reason for all his actions, but not the results.","provided I may look upon the sun and the moon and gaze at the other planets; provided I may trace their risings and settings, their periods and the causes of their travelling faster or slower; provided I may behold all the stars that shine at night \u2013 some fixed, others not travelling far afield but circling within the same area; some suddenly shooting forth, and others dazzling the eye with scattered fire, as if they are falling, or gliding past with a long trail of blazing light; provided I can commune with these and, so far as humans may, associate with the divine, and provided I can keep my mind always directed upwards, striving for a vision of kindred things \u2013 what does it matter what ground I stand on?","[...] so l\xe4\xdft der, welcher der Lust nachjagt, alles andere liegen, und die Freiheit ist das erste, was er preisgibt [...]","And if wisdom were given me under the express condition that it must be kept hidden and not uttered, I should refuse it. No good thing is pleasant to possess, without friends to share it.","You should, I need hardly say, live in such a way that there is nothing which you could not as easily tell your enemy as keep to yourself.","God is near you, is with you, is inside you. Yes, Lucilius, there resides within us a divine spirit, which guards us and watches us in the evil and the good we do. As we treat him, so will he treat us. No man, indeed, is good without God \u2013 is any one capable of rising above fortune unless he has help from God?","It takes the whole of life to learn how to live, and - what will perhaps make you wonder more - it takes the whole of life to learn how to die.","The longer people extend their colonnades, the higher they build their towers, the wider they stretch their walks, the deeper they dig their summer grottoes, the more massively they raise the roofs of their dining-halls, so much the more will there be to cut off the sight of heaven.","The one wants a friend for his own advantage; the other wants to make himself an advantage to his friend.","Nothing is more successful in bringing honourable influences to bear upon the mind, or in straightening out the wavering spirit that is prone to evil, than association with good men. For the frequent seeing, the frequent hearing of them little by little sinks into the heart and acquires the force of precepts.","Here is another saying of Epicurus: \u2018If you shape your life according to nature, you will never be poor; if according to people\u2019s opinions, you will never be rich.\u2019 Nature\u2019s wants are small, while those of opinion are limitless. Imagine that you\u2019ve piled, up all that a veritable host of rich men ever possessed, that fortune has carried you far beyond the bounds of wealth so far as any private individual is concerned, building you a roof of gold and clothing you in royal purple, conducting you to such a height of opulence and luxury that you hide the earth with marble floors \u2013 putting you in a position not merely to own, but to walk all over treasures \u2013 throw in sculptures, paintings, all that has been produced at tremendous pains by all the arts to satisfy extravagance: all these things will only induce in you a craving for even bigger things. Natural desires are limited; those which spring from false opinions have nowhere to stop, for falsity has no point of termination. When a person is following a track, there is an eventual end to it somewhere, but with wandering at large there is no limit. So give up pointless, empty journeys, and whenever you want to know whether the desire aroused in you by something you are pursuing is natural or quite unseeing, ask yourself whether it is capable of coming to rest at any point; if after going a long way there is always something remaining farther away, be sure it is not something natural.

What we have to seek for, then, is that which does not each day pass more and more under the control of some power which cannot be withstood. And what is this?

Let us therefore inquire, not what is most commonly done, but what is best for us to do, and what will establish us in the possession of undying happiness, not what is approved of by the vulgar, the worst possible exponents of truth.","Consider, too, that a man lifting his head from the very funeral pyre must need some novel vocabulary not drawn from ordinary everyday condolence to comfort his own dear ones.","Every new beginning comes from other beginning\u2019s end.","He who boasts of his descent, praises the deeds of another.","Quaedam iura non scripta, sed omnibus scriptis certiora sunt.","a man\'s peace of mind does not depend upon Fortune; for, even when angry she grants enough for our needs.","Look back in memory and consider when you ever had a fixed plan, how few days have passed as you had intended, when you were ever at your own disposal, when your face ever wore its natural expression, when your mind was ever unperturbed, what work you have achieved in so long a life, how many have robbed you of life when you were not aware of what you were losing, how much was taken up in useless sorrow, in foolish joy, in greedy desire, in the allurements of society, how little of yourself was left to you; you will perceive that you are dying before your season!","A setback has often cleared the way for greater prosperity. Many things have fallen only to rise to more exalted heights.","For everything that comes to us from chance is unstable, and the higher it rises, the more liable it is to fall. Moreover, what is doomed to perish brings pleasure to no one; very wretched, therefore, and not merely short, must the life of those be who work hard to gain what they must work harder to keep. By great toil they attain what they wish, and with anxiety hold what they have attained; meanwhile they take no account of time that will never more return. New engrossments take the place of the old, hope leads to new hope, ambition to new ambition. They do not seek an end of their wretchedness, but change the cause.","This wretched body, the chain and prison of the soul, is tossed hither and thither; upon it punishment and pillage and disease wreak havoc: but the soul itself is holy and eternal, and it cannot be assailed with violence.","Nije da se ne usu\u0111ujemo zato \u0161to su stvari te\u0161ke; ve\u0107 su stvari te\u0161ke zato \u0161to se ne usu\u0111ujemo.","For a person who is not aware that he is doing anything wrong has no desire to be put right. You have to catch yourself doing it before you can reform.","That man is happiest, and is secure in his own possession of himself, who can await the morrow without apprehension. When a man has said: \u201cI have lived!, every morning he arises he receives a bonus.\u201d","Wisdom is the perfect good of the human mind; philosophy is the love of wisdom, and the endeavor to attain it.","What shall we not go in fear of if we fear that which cowardice itself has chosen for its refuge?","But let him consider that those disorders which are so dangerous that they have gained ground in spite of treatment can generally be treated by opposite methods.","Why then do you occupy me with the words rather than with the works of wisdom? Make me braver, make me calmer, make me the equal of Fortune, make me her superior. And I can be her superior, if I apply to this end everything that I learn.

Even a","But what difference does it make who spoke the words? They were uttered for the world.","Never have I trusted Fortune, even when she seemed to offer peace. All those blessings which she kindly bestowed on me - money, public office, influence - I relegated to a place whence she could claim them back without bothering me. I kept a wide gap between them and me, with the result that she has taken them away, not torn them away.","En wanneer de natuur mijn levensadem terugvraagt of mijn verstand hem heenzendt, zal ik heengaan met het getuigenis dat ik een eerlijk geweten en een eerlijke inzet beminde, dat niemands vrijheid door mij is ingeperkt, en wel in het minst die van mijzelf.","They are pleased to deceive themselves, as if they deceived Fate at the same time.","Let my mind be fixed on itself, cultivate itself, have no external interest \u2013 nothing that seeks the approval of another; let it cherish the tranquillity that has no part in public or private concerns.","Only an absolute fool values a man according to his clothes, or according to his social position, which after all is only something that we wear like clothing.","Finally, it is generally agreed that no activity can be successfully pursued by an individual who is preoccupied - not rhetoric or liberal studies - since the mind when distracted absorbs nothing deeply, but rejects everything which is, so to speak, crammed into it.","no prizefighter can go with high spirits into the strife if he has never been beaten black and blue; the only contestant who can confidently enter the lists is the man who has seen his own blood, who has felt his teeth rattle beneath his opponent\'s fist, who has been tripped and felt the full force of his adversary\'s charge, who has been downed in body but not in spirit, one who, as often as he falls, rises again with greater defiance than ever.","If you wish to have leisure for your mind, either be a poor man, or resemble a poor man. Study","No one, I think, rates virtue higher or is more consecrated to virtue than he who has lost his reputation for being a good man in order to keep from losing the approval of his conscience.","What mental darkness, what ignorance of the truth blinds those who, though afflicted by the fear of poverty, yet take pleasure in imitating it!","It takes you more time to solve a problem than to set it.","What use is it to me to be able to divide a piece of land into equal areas if I\u2019m unable to divide it with a brother?","reading of many books is distraction.","And besides this, in order that virtue may be perfect, there should be an even temperament and a scheme of life that is consistent with itself throughout; and this result cannot be attained without knowledge of things, and without the art1 which enables us to understand things human and things divine.","Study cannot be helpful unless you take pains to live simply; and living simply is voluntary poverty. Away, then, with all excuses like: \u201cI have not yet enough; when I have gained the desired amount, then I shall devote myself wholly to philosophy. And yet this ideal, which you are putting off and placing second to other interests, should be secured first of all; you should begin with it. You retort: \u201cI wish to acquire something to live on.\u201d Yes, but learn while you are acquiring it; for if anything forbids you to live nobly, nothing forbids you to die nobly. There is no reason why poverty should call us away from philosophy\u2014no, nor even actual want.\u201d","Peace of mind is enjoyed only by those who have attained a fixed and unchanging standard of judgment; the rest of mankind continually ebb and flow in their decisions, floating in a condition where they alternately reject things and seek them.","Armies have endured all manner of want, have lived on roots, and have resisted hunger by means of food too revolting to mention. All this they have suffered to gain a kingdom, and\u2014what is more marvellous\u2014to gain a kingdom that will be another\u2019s. Will any man hesitate to endure poverty, in order that he may free his mind from madness?","Sometimes even to live is an act of courage. \xa0 Anger\u201d","Why do you wait, asks he. \u201cWhy are you idle? If you don\u2019t seize the day, it escapes.\u201d Even though you seize it, it still will flee; therefore you must compete with time\u2019s haste in the speed of using it, and, like a gush of water that blasts past and will not always flow calmly, you must drink fast.\u201d","Why does no one admit his failings? Because he\u2019s still deep in them. It\u2019s the person who\u2019s awakened who recounts his dream, and acknowledging one\u2019s failings is a sign of health.","What we have to seek for, then, is that which does not each day pass more and more under the control of some power which cannot be withstood. And what is this? It is the soul\u2014but the soul that is upright, good, and great. What else could you call such a soul than a god dwelling as a guest in a human body? A soul like this may descend into a Roman knight just as well as into a freedman\u2019s son or a slave. For what is a Roman knight, or a freedman\u2019s son, or a slave? They are mere titles, born of ambition or of wrong. One may leap to heaven from the very slums. Only rise And mould thyself to kinship with thy God. This moulding will not be done in gold or silver; an image that is to be in the likeness of God cannot be fashioned of such materials;","We are born under circumstances that would be favourable if we did not abandon them.","Just as the same chain fastens the prisoner and the soldier who guards him, so hope and fear, dissimilar as they are, keep step together; fear follows hope. 8. I am not surprised that they proceed in this way; each alike belongs to a mind that is in suspense, a mind that is fretted by looking forward to the future. But the chief cause of both these ills is that we do not adapt ourselves to the present, but send our thoughts a long way ahead. And so foresight, the noblest blessing of the human race, becomes perverted. 9. Beasts avoid the dangers which they see, and when they have escaped them are free from care; but we men torment ourselves over that which is to come as well as over that which is past. Many of our blessings bring bane to us; for memory recalls the tortures of fear, while foresight anticipates them. The present alone can make no man wretched.","We cease to be so angry once we cease to be so hopeful. \u201cNothing\u201d","If you regard your last day not as a punishment but as a law of nature, the breast from which you have banished the dread of death no fear will dare to enter.","Wherever there is a human being, there is an opportunity for a kindness. \u201cA\u201d","O, what blindness does great prosperity cast upon our minds!","Philosophy is no trick to catch the public; it is not devised for show. It is a matter, not of words, but of facts. It is not pursued in order that the day may yield some amusement before it is spent, or that our leisure may be relieved of a tedium that irks us. It moulds and constructs the soul; it orders our life, guides our conduct, shows us what we should do and what we should leave undone; it sits at the helm and directs our course as we waver amid uncertainties. Without it, no one can live fearlessly or in peace of mind. Countless things that happen every hour call for advice; and such advice is to be sought in philosophy.","Consid\xe9rez bien toutes les choses dont la perte nous tire des larmes et nous trouble le sens ; vous trouverez que ce qui nous afflige n\u2019est pas tant ce que nous perdons que ce que nous croyons avoir perdu.

It is homegrown, wholly self-developed. Once it starts looking outside itself for any part of itself it is on the way to being dominated by fortune.","It is likely that some troubles will befall us; but it is not a present fact. How often has the unexpected happened! How often has the expected never come to pass! And even though it is ordained to be, what does it avail to run out to meet your suffering? You will suffer soon enough, when it arrives; so look forward meanwhile to better things. What shall you gain by doing this? Time. There will be many happenings meanwhile which will serve to postpone, or end, or pass on to another person, the trials which are near or even in your very presence. A fire has opened the way to flight. Men have been let down softly by a catastrophe. Sometimes the sword has been checked even at the victim\u2019s throat. Men have survived their own executioners. Even bad fortune is fickle. Perhaps it will come, perhaps not; in the meantime it is not. So look forward to better things.","Each day... acquire something which will help you to face poverty, or death, and other ills as well. After running over a lot of different thoughts, pick out one to be digested thoroughly that day.","Nothing is ours, except time. We were entrusted by nature with the ownership of this single thing. It it so fleeting and slippery that anyone who wills can oust us from possession. What fools these mortals be! They allow the cheapest and most useless things, which can easily be replaced, to be charged in the reckoning after they have acquired them. But they never regard themselves as in debt when they have received some of that precious commodity, time. And yet time is the one loan which even a grateful recipient cannot repay.","Not single is the death which comes; the death Which takes us off is but the last of all.","Nature gave us legs with which to do our own walking, and eyes with which to do our own seeing.","But now, to close my letter, I have only to stamp the usual seal upon it, in other words, to commit thereto some noble message to be delivered to you: \\"The fool, with all his other faults, has this also, he is always getting ready to live.\\" Reflect, my esteemed Lucilius, what this saying means, and you will see how revolting is the fickleness of men who lay down every day new foundations of life, and begin to build up fresh hopes even at the brink of the grave.","Nature permits us respite only when we are free from the desires of the flesh. It is a truth that sustains us and is a serious principle at the heart of all existence. It lifts our life beyond the confines of earthly concerns and exalts our natures to the stars. Is this not a miracle?","Where you arrive does not matter so much as what sort of person you are when you arrive there.

The most disgraceful kind of loss, however, is that due to carelessness.","foresee all the attacks and all the onslaughts of Fortune long before they hit me. She falls heavily on those to whom she is unexpected; the man who is always expecting her easily withstands her. For an enemy\u2019s arrival too scatters those whom it catches off guard; but those who have prepared in advance for the coming conflict, being properly drawn up and equipped, easily withstand the first onslaught, which is the most violent.","Sometimes it is sweet to be mad,","He suffers more than necessary, who suffers before it is necessary\u2026","Lay hold of to-day\'s task, and you will not need to depend so much upon tomorrow\'s.","Suppose our feet ache, with little needling pains in the joints: at this stage we pass it off and say we\'ve sprained an ankle or strained something in some exercise or other; while the disorder is in its indeterminate, commencing phase, its name eludes us, but once it starts bending he feet in just the way an ankle-rack does and makes them both misshapen, we have to confess we\'ve got the gout. WIth afflictions of the spirit, though, the opposite is the case: the worse a person is, the less he feels it. You needn\'t feel surprised, my dearest Lucilius; a person sleeping lightly percieves impressions in his dreams and is sometimes, even aware during sleep that he is asleep, whereas a heavy slumber blots out even dreams and plunges the mind too deep for counciousness of self. Why does no one admit his failings? Because he is still deep in them. It\'s the person who\'s awakend who recounts his dreams, and acknowledging one\'s failings is a sign of health.","Some vices delight them as being proofs of their prosperity; it seems the part of a man who is very lowly and despicable to know what he is doing.","I find in the writings of our Hecato that the limiting of desires helps also to cure fears: \\"Cease to hope,\\" he says, \\"and you will cease to fear.","Philosophy did not find Plato already a nobleman ; it made him one.","linger among a limited number of master thinkers, and digest their works,","What good does it do you to go overseas, to move from city to city?

No good thing is pleasant to possess, without friends to share it.","If you wish,\\" said he, \\"to make Pythocles rich, do not add to his store of money, but subtract from his desires.","What man can you show me who places any value on his time, who reckons the worth of each day, who understands that he is dying daily?","The man who looks for the morrow without worrying over it knows a peaceful independence and a happiness beyond all others. Whoever has said, \\"I have lived\' receives a windfall every day he gets up in the morning.","Plato says: \\"Every king springs from a race of slaves, and every slave has had kings among his ancestors.\\" The flight of time, with its vicissitudes, has jumbled all such things together, and Fortune has turned them upside down.\xa0 Then","The young character, which cannot hold fast to righteousness, must be rescued from the mob;","[W]e can have the things we need for our ordinary purposes if we will only be content with what the earth has made available on its surface.","I remembered my profession as a veteran devotee of cold water, and, clad as I was in my cloak, let myself down into the sea, just as a cold-water bather should.","What I advise you to do is, not to be unhappy before the crisis comes; since it may be that the dangers before which you paled as if they were threatening you, will never come upon you; they certainly have not yet come. Accordingly, some things torment us more than they ought; some torment us before they ought; and some torment us when they ought not to torment us at all. We are in the habit of exaggerating, or imagining, or anticipating, sorrow.","Those who wish their virtue to be advertised are not striving for virtue but for renown. Are you not willing to be just without being renowned? Nay, indeed you must often be just and be at the same time disgraced. And then, if you are wise, let ill repute, well won, be a delight.","Therefore continually remind yourself, Lucilius, how many ambitions you have attained. When you see many ahead of you, think how many are behind! If you would thank the gods, and be grateful for your past life, you should contemplate how many men you have outstripped. But what have you to do with the others? You have outstripped yourself.","LETTERA 3 LA VERA AMICIZIAMa se stimi amico uno, e poi non hai in lui la stessa fiducia che hai in te stesso, commetti un grave errore e ignori il valore della vera amicizia.","Apparently, when the arrogant King of Persia beheld the vastness of his troops spread out across boundless plains, he shed copious tears when he realized that not one man amongst his prodigious army would be alive in a hundred years\u2019 time.","So I have never believed that there was any genuine good in the things which everyone prays for; what is more, I have found them empty and daubed with showy and deceptive colours, with nothing inside to match their appearance.","You can\u2019t imagine how much of an alteration I see each day bringing about in me. \u2018Send me, too,\u2019 you will be saying, \'the things you\u2019ve found so effectual.\u2019 Indeed I desire to transfer every one of them to you; part of my joy in learning is that it puts me in a position to teach; nothing, however outstanding and however helpful, will ever give me any pleasure if the knowledge is to be for my benefit alone. If wisdom were offered me on the one condition that I should keep it shut away and not divulge it to anyone, I should reject it. There is no enjoying the possession of anything valuable unless one has someone to share it with.","why should I demand from fortune that she should give me this and that rather than demand from myself that I should not ask for them? why should I ask for them, after all? am I to pile them up in total forgetfulness of the frailty of human existence?","It takes the whole of life to learn how to live, and \u2014 what will perhaps make you wonder more \u2014 it takes the whole of life to learn how to die.","The greatest wealth is a poverty of desires","Philosophy is not an occupation of a popular nature, nor is it pursued for the sake of self-advertisement. Its concern is not with words, but with facts. It is not carried on with the object of passing the day in an entertaining sort of way and taking the boredom out of leisure. It moulds and builds the personality, orders one\u2019s life, regulates one\u2019s conduct, shows one what one should do and what one should leave undone, sits at the helm and keeps one on the correct course as one is tossed about in perilous seas. Without it no one can lead a life free of fear or worry. Every hour of the day countless situations arise that call for advice, and for that advice we have to look to philosophy.","There is only one chain which binds us to life, and that is the love of life. The chain may not be cast off, but it may be rubbed away,","reflect how pleasant it is to demand nothing, how noble it is to be contented and not to be dependent upon Fortune.","Let us postpone nothing.

One who daily puts the finishing touches to his life is never in want of time.","But he who bestows all of his time on his own needs, who plans out every day as if it were his last, neither longs for nor fears the morrow.","Philotheo. I will do so. If the world is finite and if nothing lieth beyond, I ask you Where is the world? Where is the universe? Aristotle replieth, it is in itself. [1] The convex surface of the primal heaven is universal space, which being the primal container is by naught contained. For position in space is no other than the surfaces and limit of the containing body, so that he who hath no containing body hath no position in space. [2] What then dost thou mean, O Aristotle, by this phrase, that \\"space is within itself\\"? What will be thy conclusion concerning that which is beyond the world? If thou sayest, there is nothing, then the heaven [3] and the world will certainly not be anywhere.Fracastoro. The world will then be nowhere. Everything will be nowhere.Philotheo. The world is something which is past finding out. If thou sayest (and it certainly appeareth to me that thou seekest to say something in order to escape Vacuum and Nullity), if thou sayest that beyond the world is a divine intellect, so that God doth become the position in space of all things, why then thou thyself wilt be much embarrassed to explain to us how that which is incorporeal [yet] intelligible, and without dimension can be the very position in space occupied by a dimensional body; and if thou sayest that this incorporeal space containeth as it were a form, as the soul containeth the body, then thou dost not reply to the question of that which lieth beyond, nor to the enquiry concerning that which is outside the universe. And if thou wouldst excuse thyself by asserting that where naught is, and nothing existeth, there can be no question of position in space nor of beyond or outside, yet I shall in no wise be satisfied. For these are mere words and excuses, which cannot form part of our thought. For it is wholly impossible that in any sense or fantasy (even though there may be various senses and various fantasies), it is I say impossible that I can with any true meaning assert that there existeth such a surface, boundary or limit, beyond which is neither body, nor empty space, even though God be there. For divinity hath not as aim to fill space, nor therefore doth it by any means appertain to the nature of divinity that it should be the boundary of a body. For aught which can be termed a limiting body must either be the exterior shape or else a containing body. And by no description of this quality canst thou render it compatible with the dignity of divine and universal nature. [4]","Thus far, you have indeed not been sluggish, but you must quicken your pace. Much toil remains; to confront it, you must yourself lavish all your waking hours, and all your efforts, if you wish the result to be accomplished.","Do you ask me what this real good is, and whence it derives? I will tell you: it comes from a good conscience, from honourable purposes, from right actions, from contempt of the gifts of chance, from an even and calm way of living which treads but one path.","we suffer more often in imagination than in reality.","It means much not to be spoiled by intimacy with riches; and he is truly great who is poor amidst riches.","do you know why we have not the power to attain this Stoic ideal? It is because we refuse to believe in our power.

It was once a foible confined to the Greeks to inquire into what number of rowers Ulysses had, whether the Iliad or the Odyssey was written first, whether moreover they belong to the same author, and various other matters of this stamp, which, if you keep them to yourself, in no way pleasure your secret soul, and, if you publish them, make you seem more of a bore than a scholar. But now this vain passion for learning useless things has assailed the Romans also.","nimic nu e mai odios \xeen\u0163elepciunii dec\xe2t o subtilitate excesiv\u0103","What then? Shall I not follow in the footsteps of my predecessors? I shall indeed use the old road, but if I find one that makes a shorter cut and is smoother to travel, I shall open the new road.

So you have to get used to your circumstances, complain about them as little as possible, and grasp whatever advantage they have to offer: no condition is so bitter that a stable mind cannot find some consolation in it.","Is there anything more ridiculous than a person talking with certitude about the future? Such people devote their energy on creating a better life for themselves \u2013 spending their life preparing for life! They are motivated by thoughts of a distant tomorrow; but postponing life is the greatest waste of time; it deprives them of each new day life brings, it steals from the present with the promise of the hereafter. The greatest obstacle to living a full life is having expectations, delaying gratification based on what might happen tomorrow which squanders today. Where do you focus? At what point do you aim? Everything that is to come is steeped in uncertainty; live now!","Non \xe8 perch\xe9 ci appaiono inaccessibili che non abbiamo il coraggio di affrontare le cose: \xe8 perch\xe9 non abbiamo il coraggio di affrontarle, che le cose ci appaiono inaccessibilil","By the toil of others we are led into the presence of things which have been brought from darkness into light.

And often this living nobly means that you cannot live long.","You will see that the most powerful and highly placed men let drop remarks in which they long for leisure, acclaim it, and prefer it to all their blessings. They desire at times, if it could be with safety, to descend from their high pinnacle; for, though nothing from without should assail or shatter, Fortune of its very self comes crashing down.8 The deified Augustus, to whom the gods vouchsafed more than to any other man, did not cease to pray for rest and to seek release from public affairs; all his conversation ever reverted to this subject\u2014his hope of leisure. This was the sweet, even if vain, consolation with which he would gladden his labours\u2014that he would one day live for himself. In a letter addressed to the senate, in which he had promised that his rest would not be devoid of dignity nor inconsistent with his former glory, I find these words: \\"But these matters can be shown better by deeds than by promises. Nevertheless, since the joyful reality is still far distant, my desire for that time most earnestly prayed for has led me to forestall some of its delight by the pleasure of words.\\" So desirable a thing did leisure seem that he anticipated it in thought because he could not attain it in reality. He who saw everything depending upon himself alone, who determined the fortune of individuals and of nations, thought most happily of that future day on which he should lay aside his greatness. He had discovered how much sweat those blessings that shone throughout all lands drew forth, how many secret worries they concealed. Forced to pit arms first against his countrymen, then against his colleagues, and lastly against his relatives, he shed blood on land and sea. Through Macedonia, Sicily, Egypt, Syria, and Asia, and almost all countries he followed the path of battle, and when his troops were weary of shedding Roman blood, he turned them to foreign wars. While he was pacifying the Alpine regions, and subduing the enemies planted in the midst of a peaceful empire, while he was extending its bounds even beyond the Rhine and the Euphrates and the Danube, in Rome itself the swords of Murena, Caepio, Lepidus, Egnatius, and others were being whetted to slay him. Not yet had he escaped their plots, when his daughter9 and all the noble youths who were bound to her by adultery as by a sacred oath, oft alarmed his failing years\u2014and there was Paulus, and a second time the need to fear a woman in league with an Antony.10 When be had cut away these ulcers11 together with the limbs themselves, others would grow in their place; just as in a body that was overburdened with blood, there was always a rupture somewhere. And so he longed for leisure, in the hope and thought of which he found relief for his labours. This was the prayer of one who was able to answer the prayers of mankind.","There is no great genius without tincture of madness.","We are born under circumstances that would be favourable if we did not abandon them. It was nature\'s intention that there should be no need of great equipment for a good life: every individual can make himself happy. External goods are of trivial importance and without much influence in either direction: prosperity does not elevate the sage and adversity does not depress him.","But we may fairly say that they alone are engaged in the true duties of life who shall wish to have Zeno, Pythagoras, Democritus, and all the other high priests of liberal studies, and Aristotle and Theophrastus, as their most intimate friends every day. No one of these will be \\"not at home,\\" no one of these will fail to have his visitor leave more happy and more devoted to himself than when he came, no one of these will allow anyone to leave him with empty hands; all mortals can meet with them by night or by day.No one of these will force you to die, but all will teach you how to die; no one of these will wear out your years, but each will add his own years to yours; conversations with no one of these will bring you peril, the friendship of none will endanger your life, the courting of none will tax your purse. From them you will take whatever you wish; it will be no fault of theirs if you do not draw the utmost that you can desire. What happiness, what a fair old age awaits him who has offered himself as a client to these! He will have friends from whom he may seek counsel on matters great and small, whom he may consult every day about himself, from whom he may hear truth without insult, praise without flattery, and after whose likeness he may fashion himself.We are wont to say that it was not in our power to choose the parents who fell to our lot, that they have been given to men by chance; yet we may be the sons of whomsoever we will. Households there are of noblest intellects; choose the one into which you wish to be adopted; you will inherit not merely their name, but even their property, which there will be no need to guard in a mean or niggardly spirit; the more persons you share it with, the greater it will become. These will open to you the path to immortality, and will raise you to a height from which no one is cast down. This is the only way of prolonging mortality\u2014nay, of turning it into immortality. Honours, monuments, all that ambition has commanded by decrees or reared in works of stone, quickly sink to ruin; there is nothing that the lapse of time does not tear down and remove. But the works which philosophy has consecrated cannot be harmed; no age will destroy them, no age reduce them; the following and each succeeding age will but increase the reverence for them, since envy works upon what is close at hand, and things that are far off we are more free to admire. The life of the philosopher, therefore, has wide range, and he is not confined by the same bounds that shut others in. He alone is freed from the limitations of the human race; all ages serve him as if a god. Has some time passed by? This he embraces by recollection. Is time present? This he uses. Is it still to come? This he anticipates. He makes his life long by combining all times into one.But those who forget the past, neglect the present, and fear for the future have a life that is very brief and troubled; when they have reached the end of it, the poor wretches perceive too late that for such a long while they have been busied in doing nothing.","Where you arrive does not matter as much as what sort of person you are when you arrive there.","Honours, monuments, whatever the ambitious have ordered by decrees or raised in public buildings are soon destroyed: there is nothing that the passage of time does not demolish and remove.","For obstinacy, from which Fortune often extorts something, is bound to bring wretchedness and anxiety, and much more serious is the fickleness that nowhere restrains itself. Both are hostile to tranquillity, and find change impossible and endurance impossible.","Return now to these studies and they will keep you safe. They will comfort you, they will delight you; and if they will genuinely penetrate your mind, never again will grief enter there, or anxiety, or the distress caused by futile and pointless suffering.","The part of life we really live is small.\\" For all the rest of existence is not life, but merely time.","And arrogance is nothing else than a false show of greatness.","life is not worth living, and there is no limit to our sorrows, if we indulge our fears to the greatest possible extent;","Real joy, believe me, is a stern matter.","No good thing is pleasant to possess, without friends to share it.","So the life of the philosopher extends widely: he is not confined by the same boundary as are others. He alone is free from the laws that limit the human race, and all ages serve him as though he were a god. Some time has passed: he grasps it in his recollection. Time is present: he uses it. Time is to come: he anticipates it. This combination of all times into one gives him a long life.","Compra solamente lo necesario, no lo conveniete. Lo innecesario, aunque cueste un solo centimo, es caro.Buy only what is necessary, not what is convenient. What is unnecessary, even if it only costs one cent, is expensive.","That man who had prayed for the fasces, when he attains them, desires to lay them aside and says over and over: \u201cWhen will this year be over!","It is not the man who has too little who is poor, but the one who hankers after more. What difference does it make how much there is laid away in a man\u2019s safe or in his barns, how many head of stock he grazes or how much capital he puts out at interest, if he is always after what is another\u2019s and only counts what he has yet to get, never what he has already. You ask what is the proper limit to a person\u2019s wealth? First, having what is essential, and second, having what is enough.","the mind itself suggests to itself many perverted, vicious forms of pleasure? \u2014 in the first place arrogance, excessive self-esteem, swaggering precedence over other men, a shortsighted, nay, a blind devotion to his own interests, dissolute luxury, excessive delight springing from the most trifling and childish causes, and also talkativeness, pride that takes a pleasure in insulting others, sloth, and the decay of a dull mind which goes to sleep over itself.","It\'s not on our account that the world enjoys the cycle of winter and summer: such things follow their own laws, by which the divine purpose is carried out.20\' We think too much of ourselves if we fancyourselves worthy of causing such great stirrings. None of these things, then, happens with the aim of wronging us-rather, quite the opposite, none of these things happens save for our well-being.","Disasters, therefore, and losses, and wrongs, have only the same power over virtue that a cloud has over the sun.","Life is divided into three periods, past, present and future. Of these, the present is short, the future is doubtful, the past is certain. For this last is the one over which Fortune has lost her power, which cannot be brought back to anyone\u2019s control.","Human greatness is not discovered until it is tested; we must be hardened against fortune by fortune itself","Now God, who is the Father of us all, has placed ready to our hands those things which he intended for our own good; he did not wait for any search on our part, and he gave them to us voluntarily. But that which would be injurious, he buried deep in the earth. We can complain of nothing but ourselves; for we have brought to light the materials for our destruction, against the will of Nature, who hid them from us.","Virtue is not vouchsafed to a soul unless that soul has been trained and taught, and by unremitting practice brought to perfection.","longing for the future and weariness of the present.","No time is too short for criminals to do wrong.","That advocate is lionized throughout the whole forum, and fills all the place with a great crowd that stretches farther than he can be heard, yet he says: \u201cWhen will vacation time come?","It\'s easier to get philosophers to agree than clocks.","Those who choose to have no real purpose in life are ever rootless and dissatisfied, tossed by their aimlessness into ever-changing situations.","who as though inspired with divine utterance sings salutary verses: Life","You ask what progress I have made? I have begun to be a friend to myself.","They lose the day in waiting for the night, and the night in fearing the dawn.","Hence, good does not spring from evil, any more than figs grow from olive-trees. Things which grow correspond to their seed; and goods cannot depart from their class.","There is no enjoying the possession of anything valuable unless one has someone to share it with.","We ought not, therefore, to give over our hearts for good to any one part of the world. We should live with the conviction: \'I wasn\u201ft born for one particular corner: the whole world\u201fs my home country.","No man is brave and earnest if he avoids danger, if his spirit does not grow with the very difficulty of his task.","Why are you idle? If you don\u2019t grasp it first, it flees.\u2019 And even if you do grasp it, it will still flee. So you must match time\u2019s swiftness with your speed in using it, and you must drink quickly as though from a rapid stream that will not always flow. In","To consort with the crowd is harmful; there is no person who does not make some vice attractive to us, or stamp it upon us, or taint us unconsciously therewith. Certainly, the greater the mob with which we mingle, the greater the danger.","Only the poor man counts his flock.","Just as a lingering illness makes men querulous and irritable and drives them wild at the least crossing of their desires,","But if you keep turning round and looking about, in order to see how much you may carry away with you, and how much money you may keep to equip yourself for the life of leisure, you will never find a way out.","Everyone goes out of life just as if he had but lately entered it.","This is the touchstone of such a spirit; no prizefighter can go with high spirits into the strife if he has never been beaten black and blue; the only contestant who can confidently enter the lists is the man who has seen his own blood, who has felt his teeth rattle beneath his opponent\'s fist, who has been tripped and felt the full force of his adversary\'s charge, who has been downed in body but not in spirit, one who, as often as he falls, rises again with greater defiance than ever.","You live as if you will live forever, no care for your mortality ever enters your head, you pay no mind to how much time has already gone by.","Where you arrive does not matter so much as what sort of person you are when you arrive there.","...sola est quies,mecum ruina cuncta si video abruta;mecum omnia abeant.

We should live with the conviction: \'I wasn\'t born for one particular corner: the whole world\'s my home country.","Most human beings, Paulinus,* complain about the meanness of nature, because we are born for a brief span of life, and because this spell of time that has been given to us rushes by so swiftly and rapidly that with very few exceptions life ceases for the rest of us just when we are getting ready for it.","El verdadero h\xe9roe en una obra literaria es el lector que la aguanta\\".","Disposons donc notre esprit \xe0 prendre en gr\xe9 tout ce qui arrivera, et surtout que la pens\xe9e de notre fin ne nous afflige pas. Il faut faire ses pr\xe9paratifs pour la mort avant que de songer aux provisions pour la vie","Still, my determination to put your moral strength of purpose to the test is such that I propose to give even you the following direction found in great men\'s teaching: set aside now and then a number of days during which you will be content with the plainest of food, and very little of it, and with rough, coarse clothing, and will ask yourself \'Is this what one used to dread?\' It is in times of security that the spirit should be preparing itself to deal with the difficult time; while fortune is bestowing favours on it then is the time for it to be strengthened against her rebuffs. In the midst of peace the soldier carries out manoeuvres, throws up earthworks against a non-existent enemy and tires himself out with unnecessary toil in order to be equal to it when it is necessary. If you want a man to keep his head when crisis comes you must give hime some training before it comes. This was the aim of the men who once every month pretended they were poor, bringing themselves face to face with want to prevent their ever being terrified by a situation which they had frequently rehearsed.","in you has been seen that matchless ornament, that loveliest beauty which is not dependent on any time of life, that greatest glory of all \u2013 modesty.","C\u2019est la nature, dis-tu, qui me donne tous ces biens.

I allow him no day of grace; he is unhappy forthwith.","It would be superfluous to mention more who, though others deemed them the happiest of men, have expressed their loathing for every act of their years, and with their own lips have given true testimony against themselves; but by these complaints they changed neither themselves nor others. For when they have vented their feelings in words, they fall back into their usual round. Heaven knows! such lives as yours, though they should pass the limit of a thousand years, will shrink into the merest span; your vices will swallow up any amount of time. The space you have, which reason can prolong, although it naturally hurries away, of necessity escapes from you quickly; for you do not seize it, you neither hold it back, nor impose delay upon the swiftest thing in the world, but you allow it to slip away as if it were something superfluous and that could be replaced.","Accordingly, since you cannot read all the books which you may possess, it is enough to possess only as many books as you can read. 4. \\"But,\\" you reply, \\"I wish to dip first into one book and then into another.\\" I tell you that it is the sign of an overnice appetite to toy with many dishes; for when they are manifold and varied, they cloy but do not nourish. So you should always read standard authors; and when you crave a change, fall back upon those whom you read before.","The present alone can make no man wretched.","Afasta-te da companhia dos perniciosos, eles fazem nascer em ti um licenciosidade que lhe \xe9 natutal.","[W]hatever happens is never as serious as rumour makes it out to be.","You must be not only present in the body, but watchful in mind, if you would avail yourself of the fleeting opportunity.

And why should I crave? Shall I heap up my winnings, and forget that man\u2019s lot is unsubstantial? For what end should I toil?","Add to this that he who laughs at the human race deserves better of it than he who mourns for it, for the former leaves it some good hopes of improvement, while the latter stupidly weeps over what he has given up all hopes of mending.","Men do not care how nobly they live, but only how long, although it is within the reach of every man to live nobly, but within no man\'s power to live long. Farewell.","As often as you wish to know what is to be avoided or what is to be sought, consider its relation to the Supreme Good, to the purpose of your whole life. For whatever we do ought to be in harmony with this; no man can set in order the details unless he has already set before himself the chief purpose of his life. The artist may have his colours all prepared, but he cannot produce a likeness unless he has already made up his mind what he wishes to paint. The reason we make mistakes is because we all consider the parts of life, but never life as a whole. 3. The archer must know what he is seeking to hit; then he must aim and control the weapon by his skill. Our plans miscarry because they have no aim. When a man does not know what harbour he is making for, no wind is the right wind. Chance must necessarily have great influence over our lives, because we live by chance. 4. It is the case with certain men, however, that they do not know that they know certain things. Just as we often go searching for those who stand beside us, so we are apt to forget that the goal of the Supreme Good lies near us.","If you would escape your troubles, you need not another place but another personality.","Dum inter homines sumus, colamus humanitatem\\"\\"As long as we are among humans, let us be humane","Would you not regard as foolish one who was afraid of a multitude in a place where only one at a time could pass? Just so, there are not many who have access to you to slay you, though there are many who threaten you with death. Nature has so ordered it that, as only one has given you life, so only one will take it away.","the minds of the preoccupied, as if harnessed in a yoke, cannot turn round and look behind them. So their lives vanish into an abyss; and just as it is no use pouring any amount of liquid into a container without a bottom to catch and hold it, so it does not matter how much time we are given if there is nowhere for it to settle; it escapes through the cracks and holes of the mind.","Any truth, I maintain, is my own property. And I shall continue to heap quotations from Epicurus upon you, so that all persons who swear by the words of another, and put a value upon the speaker and not upon the thing spoken, may understand that the best ideas are common property.

Conflicting thoughts divide my heart. When good and evil lie so close together, the doubting mind must fear the truth it seeks...","Many pursue no fixed goal, but are tossed about in ever-changing designs by a fickleness which is shifting, inconstant and never satisfied with itself.","Epicurus. Frag. 477 and 200 Usener] \\"Poverty brought into conformity with the law of nature, is great wealth.\\" Do you know what limits that law of nature ordains for us? Merely to avert hunger, thirst, and cold. In order to banish hunger and thirst, it is not necessary for you to pay court at the doors of the purse-proud, or to submit to the stern frown, or to the kindness that humiliates; nor is it necessary for you to scour the seas, or go campaigning; nature\'s needs are easily provided and ready to hand. 11. It is the superfluous things for which men sweat, - the superfluous things that wear our togas threadbare, that force us to grow old in camp, that dash us upon foreign shores. That which is enough is ready to our hands. He who has made a fair compact with poverty is rich.","Ready and determined, I follow the advice of Zeno, Cleanthes, and Chrysippus, all of whom bid one take part in public affairs, though none of them ever did so himself: and then, as soon as something disturbs my mind, which is not used to receiving shocks, as soon as something occurs which is either disgraceful, such as often occurs in all men\'s lives, or which does not proceed quite easily, or when subjects of very little importance require me to devote a great deal of time to them, I go back to my life of leisure, and, just as even tired cattle go faster when they are going home, I wish to retire and pass my life within the walls of my house. \\"No one,\\" I say, \\"that will give me no compensation worth such a loss shall ever rob me of a day. Let my mind be contained within itself and improve itself: let it take no part with other men\'s affairs, and do nothing which depends on the approval of others: let me enjoy a tranquility undisturbed by either public or private troubles.","Every pleasure is most valued when it is coming to an end?","Shall I tell you what philosophy holds out to humanity? Counsel.","Why of your own accord postpone your real life to the distant future?

Do you compel me to withdraw from the whole and restrict me to a part? May I not ask what are the beginnings of all things, who moulded the universe, who took the confused and conglomerate mass of sluggish matter, and separated it into its parts? May I not inquire who is the Master-Builder of this universe, how the mighty bulk was brought under the control of law and order, who gathered together the scattered atoms, who separated the disordered elements and assigned an outward form to elements that lay in one vast shapelessness? Or whence came all the expanse of light? And whether is it fire, or even brighter than fire? Am I not to ask these questions? Must I be ignorant of the heights whence I have descended? Whether I am to see this world but once, or to be born many times? What is my destination afterwards? What abode awaits my soul on its release from the laws of slavery among men? Do you forbid me to have a share in heaven? In other words, do you bid me live with my head bowed down? No, I am above such an existence; I was born to a greater destiny than to be a mere chattel of my body, and I regard this body as nothing but a chain which manacles my freedom. Therefore, I offer it as a sort of buffer to Fortune, and shall allow no wound to penetrate through to my soul. For my body is the only part of me which can suffer injury. In this dwelling, which is exposed to peril, my soul lives free. Never shall this flesh drive me to feel fear or to assume any pretence that is unworthy of a good man. Never shall I lie in order to honour this petty body.","not to give in to adversity, never to trust prosperity, and always take full note of fortune\u2019s habit of behaving just as she pleases, treating her as if she were actually going to do everything it is in her power to do.

Yes, but learn while you are acquiring it; for if anything forbids you to live nobly, nothing forbids you to die nobly.\u201d","But it is hard to keep within bounds in that which you believe to be good.

I will tell you: it comes from a good conscience, from honourable purposes, from right actions, from contempt of the gifts of chance, from an even and calm way of living which treads but one path. For men who leap from one purpose to another, or do not even leap but are carried over by a sort of hazard, \u2013 how can such wavering and unstable persons possess any good that is fixed and lasting? There are only a few who control themselves and their affairs by a guiding purpose; the rest do not proceed; they are merely swept along, like objects afloat in a river. And of these objects, some are held back by sluggish waters and are transported gently; others are torn along by a more violent current; some, which are nearest the bank, are left there as the current slackens; and others are carried out to sea by the onrush of the stream. Therefore, we should decide what we wish, and abide by the decision.","They live ill who are always beginning to live.\\" 10. You are right in asking why; the saying certainly stands in need of a commentary. It is because the life of such persons is always incomplete. But a man cannot stand prepared for the approach of death if he has just begun to live. We must make it our aim already to have lived long enough. No one deems that he has done so, if he is just on the point of planning his life. 11. You need not think that there are few of this kind; practically everyone is of such a stamp. Some men, indeed, only begin to live when it is time for them to leave off living. And if this seems surprising to you, I shall add that which will surprise you still more: Some men have left off living before they have begun.

Those people who, contrary to Theophrastus\u2019 advice, judge a man after they have made him their friend instead of the other way round, certainly put the cart before the horse.","Destruction is the universal law; do you not know, poor mortals, that life is a race to dissolution?","for only philosophy or honourable occupation can divert from its anguish a heart whose grief springs from love.","Those who lack self-control lead disturbed and tumultuous lives; their crimes are balanced by their fears, and they are never at ease.","But we must not do this often, in case the mind acquires a bad habit; yet at times it must be stimulated to rejoice without restraint and austere soberness must be banished for a while. For whether we agree with the Greek poet that \u2018Sometimes it is sweet to be mad,\u2019 or with Plato that \u2018A man sound in mind knocks in vain at the doors of poetry,\u2019 or with Aristotle that \u2018No great intellect has been without a touch of madness,\u2019 only a mind that is deeply stirred can utter something noble and beyond the power of others. When it has scorned everyday and commonplace thoughts and risen aloft on the wings of divine inspiration, only then does it sound a note nobler than mortal voice could utter. As long as it remains in its senses it cannot reach any lofty and difficult height: it must desert the usual track and race away, champing the bit and hurrying its driver in its course to a height it would have feared to scale by itself.","But you never deign to look at yourself or listen to yourself. So you have no reason to claim credit from anyone for those attentions, since you showed them not because you wanted someone else\u2019s company but because you could not bearyour own.","You should, I need hardly say, live in such a way that there is nothing which you could not as easily tell your enemy as keep to yourself;","Pure love, careless of all other things, kindles the soul with desire for the beautiful object, not without the hope of a return of the affection.","What you desire, to be undisturbed, is a great thing, nay, the greatest thing of all, and one which raises a man almost to the level of a god. The Greeks call this calm steadiness of mind euthymia, and Democritus\'s treatise upon it is excellently written: I call it peace of mind:","But for those whose life is far removed from all business it must be amply long. None of it is frittered away, none of it scattered here and there, none of it committed to fortune, none of it lost through carelessness, none of it wasted on largesse, none of it superfluous: the whole of it, so to speak, is well invested.","Beyond question the feeling of a lover has in it something akin to friendship; one might call it friendship run mad. But, though this is true, does anyone love for the sake of gain, or promotion, or renown? Pure[7] love, careless of all other things, kindles the soul with desire for the beautiful object, not without the hope of a return of the affection.","If you want to keep a secret, never share it.","For the wise man does not consider himself unworthy of any gifts from Fortune\u2019s hands: he does not love wealth but he would rather have it; he does not admit into his heart but into his home; and what wealth is his he does not reject but keeps, wishing it to supply greater scope for him to practice his virtue.","But we must mark with care what this sentence signifies and how far it applies; the wise man is sufficient unto himself for a happy existence, but not for mere existence. For he needs many helps towards mere existence; but for a happy existence he needs only a sound and upright soul, one that despises Fortune.","To be everywhere, is to be no where at all","That very thing which is called dying, the soul\u2019s departure from the body, is so brief that its swiftness cannot be perceived: whether a knot strangles your throat, or water stops you breathing, or you fall to the hard ground below and it crushes your skull, or flame you inhale cuts off the process of breathing: whatever it is, your end comes fast. Are you not blushing with shame? For so long you have dreaded what happens in a moment!","A pleasure that is ephemeral brings no true satisfaction to any man. How miserable must be the lives of those folk who labor so hard for something that once gained they must work even harder to keep. They","Medicine once consisted of the knowledge of a few simples, to stop the flow of blood, or to heal wounds; then by degrees it reached its present stage of complicated variety. No wonder that in early days medicine had less to do! Men\'s bodies were still sound and strong; their food was light and not spoiled by art and luxury, whereas when they began to seek dishes not for the sake of removing, but of rousing, the appetite, and devised countless sauces to whet their gluttony, \u2013 then what before was nourishment to a hungry man became a burden to the full stomach. 16. Thence come paleness, and a trembling of wine-sodden muscles, and a repulsive thinness, due rather to indigestion than to hunger. Thence weak tottering steps, and a reeling gait just like that of drunkenness. Thence dropsy, spreading under the entire skin, and the belly growing to a paunch through an ill habit of taking more than it can hold. Thence yellow jaundice, discoloured countenances, and bodies that rot inwardly, and fingers that grow knotty when the joints stiffen, and muscles that are numbed and without power of feeling, and palpitation of the heart with its ceaseless pounding. 17. Why need I mention dizziness? Or speak of pain in the eye and in the ear, itching and aching[11] in the fevered brain, and internal ulcers throughout the digestive system? Besides these, there are countless kinds of fever, some acute in their malignity, others creeping upon us with subtle damage, and still others which approach us with chills and severe ague. 18. Why should I mention the other innumerable diseases, the tortures that result from high living? \xa0 Men used to be free from such ills, because they had not yet slackened their strength by indulgence, because they had control over themselves, and supplied their own needs.[12] They toughened their bodies by work and real toil, tiring themselves out by running or hunting or tilling the earth. They were refreshed by food in which only a hungry man could take pleasure. Hence, there was no need for all our mighty medical paraphernalia, for so many instruments and pill-boxes. For plain reasons they enjoyed plain health;","For certain ailments must be treated while the patient is unaware of them:","therefore whenever his last day comes, the wise man will not hesitate to meet death with a firm step.","Why do you wonder that globe-trotting does not help you, seeing that you always take yourself with you?

As Lucretius says, \'Thus each man ever flees himself.\' But to what end, if he does not escape himself? He pursues and dogs himself as his own most tedious companion. And so we must realize that our difficulty is not the fault of the places but of ourselves. We are weak in enduring anything, and cannot put up with toil or pleasure or ourselves or anything for long. This weakness has driven some men to their deaths; because by frequently changing their aims they kept falling back on the same things and had left themselves no room for novelty. They began to be sick of life and the world itself, and out of their enervating self-indulgence arose the feeling \'How long must I face the same things?","is natural to touch more often the part that hurts.","Never will there be a shortage of reasons for anxiety, whether born of happiness or misery; life will press on its way from one pursuit to another; leisure will never be enjoyed, though the prayer is constantly on our lips.","Again, do you call those men leisured who spend many hours at the barber\u2019s simply to cut whatever grew overnight, to have a serious debate about every separate hair, to tidy up disarranged locks or to train thinning ones from the sides to lie over the forehead?

Many think that we Stoics are holding out expectations greater than our human lot admits of; and they have a right to think so. For they have regard to the body only. But let them turn back to the soul, and they will soon measure man by the standard of God. Rouse yourself, most excellent Lucilius, and leave off all this word-play of the philosophers, who reduce a most glorious subject to a matter of syllables, and lower and wear out the soul by teaching fragments; then you will become like the men who discovered these precepts, instead of those who by their teaching do their best to make philosophy seem difficult rather than great.\u201d","they are like prowling enemies who pounce on you when occasion offers, and allow you neither to be at the ready as in war nor at ease as in peace.","You live as though you were going to live for ever, at no time taking thought for your weakness, and you fail to note how much time has already passed by.","Those were wise men, or at any rate like the wise, who found the care of the body a problem easy to solve.

You will realize that you are dying prematurely.\'So what is the reason for this? You are living as if destined to live for ever; your own frailty never occurs to you; you don\'t notice how much time has already passed, but squander it as though you had a full and overflowing supply - though all the while that very day which you are devoting to somebody or something may be your last. You act like mortals in all that you fear, and like immortals in all that you desire.","Men are tight-fisted in keeping control of their fortunes, but when it comes to the matter of wasting time, they are positively extravagant in the one area where there is honour in being miserly.","He who ponders these things [death, poverty, temptation, and suffering] in his heart is indeed full of joy; but it is not a cheerful joy.

When a person spends all his time in foreign travel, he ends by having many acquaintances, but no friends.","Men do not allow anyone to take possession of their estates, and, if there is the slightest dispute about the limit of their property, they rush to pick up stones and weapons: but they are allow others to make inroads into their life, even extending personal invitations to those who will one day possess it.","That day, which you fear as being the end of all things, is the birthday of your eternity.","Do you ask what is the proper limit to wealth? It is, first, to have what is necessary, and, second, to have what is enough.

The greater load, moreover, on the body is crushing to the spirit and renders it less active. So keep the body within bounds as much as you can and make room for the spirit.","And I hold that no man has treated mankind worse than he who has studied philosophy as if it were some marketable trade, who lives in a different manner from that which he advises.","Set aside a certain number of days, during which you shall be content with the scantiest and cheapest fare, with coarse and rough dress, saying to yourself the while: \u201cIs this the condition that I feared?

Farewell.","Read good books many times,rather than many books","Again, when my mind is lifted up by the greatness of its thoughts, it becomes ambitious for words and longs to match its higher inspiration with its language, and so produces a style that conforms to the impressiveness of the subject matter.","Even in the longest life real living is the least portion thereof.","Again, when my mind is lifted up by the greatness of its thoughts, it becomes ambitious for words and longs to match its higher inspiration with its language, and so produces a style that conforms to the impressiveness of the subject matter.

It is prosperity that takes away righteousness.","All the greatest blessings create anxiety, and Fortune is never less to be trusted than when it is fairest.","No one who goes astray affects himself alone, but rather will be the cause and instigator of someone else going astray; it is harmful to attach oneself to the people in front, and, so long as each one of us prefers to trust someone else\'s judgment rather than relying on his own, we never exercise judgment in our lives but constantly resort to trust, and a mistake that has been passed down from one hand to another takes us over and spins our ruin.","They are trifling with life\u2019s most precious commodity, being deceived because it is an intangible thing, not open to inspection and therefore reckoned very cheap \u2013 in fact, almost without any value.","If none were happy, none would believe himself unfortunate, however great his troubles. Take away wealth, and gold, and thriving lands with droves of oxen at the plough - how then the spirits of the down-pressed poor would rise!

Why then should you despair of becoming able to rank with men like these?","But the way by which we are asked to climb is steep and uneven.\\" What then? Can heights be reached by a level path? Yet they are not so sheer and precipitous as some think. It is only the first part that has rocks and cliffs and no apparent outlet, just as many hills seen from a long way off appear abruptly steep and joined together, because the distance deceives our sight, and then, as we draw nearer, those very hills which our mistaken eyes had made into one gradually unfold themselves, those parts which seemed precipitous from afar assume a gently sloping outline.","People are delighted to accept pensions and gratuities, for which they hire out their labour or their support or their services. But nobody works out the value of time: men use it lavishly as if it cost nothing. But if death threatens these same people, you will see them praying to their doctors; if they are in fear of capital punishment, you will see them prepared to spend their all to stay alive. So inconsistent are they in their feelings. But if each of us could have the tally of his future years set before him, as we can of our past years, how alarmed would be those who saw only a few years ahead, and how carefully would they use them!

There is one point in which the sage has an advantage over the god; for a god is freed from terrors by the bounty of nature, the wise man by his own bounty.","Men set very great store by pensions and doles, and for these they hire out their labor or service or effort.\xa0\xa0 But no one sets a value on time; all use it lavishly as if it cost nothing.\xa0 But see how these same people clasp the knees of physicians if they fall ill and the danger of death draws nearer, see how ready they are, if threatened with capital punishment, to spend all their possessions in order to live!\xa0 So great is the inconsistency of their feelings.","Er zijn eenvoudige, korte oefeningen die het lichaam in kort bestek afmatten en dus tijd besparen, en vooral dat laatste moeten we goed bijhouden. Ga bijvoorbeeld hardlopen, of oefenen met gewichten, of springen. Je kunt hoog- of verspringen, of laat ik zeggen \'ritueel dansen\' of, om het banaler te zeggen, stampen als de wasman in zijn tobbe. Kies maar, het is allemaal simpel en gemakkelijk om te doen.Maar wat je ook doet, keer snel weer terug van het lichaam naar de ziel! Want die moet je dag en nacht trainen, die wordt door matige inspanning gevoed. En dat soort training wordt niet belet door kou of hitte, nee, niet eens door ouderdom.Richt je op iets goeds dat op den duur alleen maar beter wordt. En ik zeg niet dat je altijd boven je boeken of schrijftafeltjes moet zitten. Laat je geest ook eens wat anders doen, maar dan zo dat het ontspannend werkt en niet ontkrachtend. Een tochtje in de wagen schudt de ledematen los, zonder de studie te beletten: je kunt iets lezen of dicteren, je kunt praten of luisteren, allemaal dingen die ook tijdens een wandeling mogelijk zijn.","The thought for today is one which I discovered in Epicurus; for I am wont to cross over even into the enemy\u2019s camp\u2014not as a deserter, but as a scout.

Therefore, you should note the following saying, taken from my reading in Pomponius: \u201cSome men shrink into dark corners, to such a degree that they see darkly by day. No, men should combine these tendencies, and he who reposes should act and he who acts should take repose.

But the man who spends all his time on his own needs, who organizes every day as though it were his last, neither longs for nor fears the next day. For what new pleasures can any hour now bring him?

The mind cannot use lofty language, above that of the common herd, unless it be excited. When it has spurned aside the commonplace environments of custom, and rises sublime, instinct with sacred fire, then alone can it chant a song too grand for mortal lips: as long as it continues to dwell within itself it cannot rise to any pitch of splendor: it must break away from the beaten track, and lash itself to frenzy, till it gnaws the curb and rushes away bearing up its rider to heights whither it would fear to climb when alone.","I force my mind to concentrate, and keep from straying to things outside itself.

So too it cannot but be that the names of those whom we have loved and lost come back to us with a sort of sting; but there is a pleasure even in this sting. 5. For, as my friend Attalus used to say: \u201cThe remembrance of lost friends is pleasant in the same way that certain fruits have an agreeably acid taste, or as in extremely old wines it is their very bitterness that pleases us. Indeed, after a certain lapse of time, every thought that gave pain is quenched, and the pleasure comes to us unalloyed. 6. If we take the word of Attalus for it, \u201cto think of friends who are alive and well is like enjoying a meal of cakes and honey; the recollection of friends who have passed away gives a pleasure that is not without a touch of bitterness. Yet who will deny that even these things, which are bitter and contain an element of sourness, do serve to arouse the stomach?\u201d 7. For my part, I do not agree with him. To me, the thought of my dead friends is sweet and appealing. For I have had them as if I should one day lose them; I have lost them as if I have them still. Therefore, Lucilius, act as befits your own serenity of mind, and cease to put a wrong interpretation on the gifts of Fortune. Fortune has taken away, but Fortune has given. 8. Let us greedily enjoy our friends, because we do not know how long this privilege will be ours.\u201d","A man has caught the message of wisdom, if he can die as free from care as he was at birth; but as it is we are all a-flutter at the approach of the dreaded end.","Happy is the man who can make others better, not merely when he is in their company, but even when he is in their thoughts!

Therefore I shall offer to the mind all its sorrows, all its mourning garments: this will not be a gentle prescription for healing, but cautery and the knife. What shall I achieve? That a soul which has conquered so many miseries will be ashamed to worry about one more wound in a body which already has so many scars.","Timendi causa est nescire.","He who suffers before it is necessary suffers more than is necessary.","Lo, to-day is the last; if not, it is near the last.","No he nacido para un s\xf3lo rinc\xf3n; mi patria es todo el mundo visible","Ta kh\xf4ng c\xf3 quy\u1ec1n thay \u0111\u1ed5i khi nh\u1eefng ho\xe0n c\u1ea3nh \u1ea5y \u0111\u1ebfn v\u1edbi m\xecnh.
