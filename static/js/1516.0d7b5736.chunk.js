It has not been in the pursuit of pleasure that I have periled life and reputation and reason. It has been the desperate attempt to escape from torturing memories, from a sense of insupportable loneliness and a dread of some strange impending doom.","False hope is nicer than no hope at all.","If a poem hasn\'t ripped apart your soul; you haven\'t experienced poetry.","That pleasure which is at once the most pure, the most elevating and the most intense, is derived, I maintain, from the contemplation of the beautiful.","Deep into that darkness peering, long I stood there, wondering, fearing, doubting, dreaming dreams no mortal ever dared to dream before.","Always keep a big bottle of booze at your side.

The weak were put on earth to give the strong pleasure.","The most natural, and, consequently, the truest and most intense of the human affections are those which arise in the heart as if by electric sympathy.","There is not a more disgusting spectacle under the sun than our subserviency to British criticism. It is disgusting, first, because it is truckling, servile, pusillanimous--secondly, because of its gross irrationality. We know the British to bear us little but ill will--we know that, in no case do they utter unbiased opinions of American books . . . we know all this, and yet, day after day, submit our necks to the degrading yoke of the crudest opinion that emanates from the fatherland.","A poem in my opinion, is opposed to a work of science by having for its immediate object, pleasure, not truth.","I fell in love with melancholy","If you are ever drowned or hung, be sure and make a note of your sensations.","You are not wrong who deem That my days have been a dream; Yet if hope has flown away In a night, or in a day, In a vision, or in none, Is it therefore the less gone?

It is not that the Deity cannot modify his laws, but that we insult him in imagining a possible necessity for modification.  In their origin these laws were fashioned to embrace all contingencies which could lie in the future.  With God all is Now.","If you wish to forget anything on the spot, make a note that this thing is to be remembered.","I am above the weakness of seeking to establish a sequence of cause and effect, between the disaster and the atrocity.","All works of art should begin... at the end.","It is impossible to say how first the idea entered my brain, but, once conceived, it haunted me day and night.","The death of a beautiful woman, is unquestionably the most poetical topic in the world.","Perversity is the human thirst for self-torture.","The reproduction of\\n what the senses perceive in nature through the veil of the soul.","And all my days are trances, And all my nightly dreams Are where thy dark eye glances, And where thy footstep gleams-- In what ethereal dances, By what eternal streams!","Hear the sledges with the bells, Silver bells!

How they tinkle, tinkle, tinkle, In the icy air of night, While the stars that oversprinkle All the Heavens seem to twinkle With a crystalline delight: Keeping time, time, time, In a sort of Runic rhyme To the tintinnabulation that so musically wells From the bells, bells, bells, bells, Bells, bells, bells-- From the jingling and the tingling of the bells.","In the Heaven\'s above, the angels, whispering to one another, can find, among their burning terms of love, none so devotional as that of \'Mother.","I am walking like a bewitched corpse, with the certainty of being eaten by the infinite, of being annulled by the only existing Absurd.","Sleep, those little slices of death \u2014 how I loathe them.","The ninety and nine are with dreams, content but the hope of the world made new, is the hundredth man who is grimly bent on making those dreams come true.","Convinced myself, I seek not to convince.","Thank Heaven! The crisis /The danger is past, and the lingering illness, is over at last /, and the fever called \'\'Living\'\' is conquered at last.","The people have nothing to do with the laws but to obey them.","I am excessively slothful, and wonderfully industrious-by fits. There are epochs when any kind of mental exercise is torture, and when nothing yields me pleasure but the solitary communion with the \'mountains & the woods\'-the \'altars\' of Byron. I have thus rambled and dreamed away whole months, and awake, at last, to a sort of mania for composition. Then I scribble all day, and read all night, so long as the disease endures.","...the agony of my soul found vent in one loud, long and final scream of despair.","In death - no! even in the grave all is not lost. Else there is no immortality for man. Arousing from the most profound slumbers, we break the gossamer web of some dream. Yet in a second afterward, (so frail may that web have been) we remember not that we have dreamed.","This maiden she lived with no other thought\\nThan to love and be loved by me.","A mystery, and a dream, should my early life seem.","The true genius shudders at incompleteness - and usually prefers silence to saying something which is not everything it should be.","Ghastly grim and ancient raven wandering from the nightly shore - Tell me what thy lordly name is on the Night\'s Plutonian shore! Quoth the raven, `Nevermore.","No pictorial or sculptural combinations of points of human loveliness, do more than approach the living and breathing human beauty as it gladdens our daily path.","Man\'s real life is happy, chiefly because he is ever expecting that it soon will be so.","Deep into that darkness peering, long I stood there wondering, fearing, Doubting, dreaming dreams no mortals ever dared to dream before; But the silence was unbroken, and the stillness gave no token, And the only word there spoken was the whispered word, \\"Lenore?\\" This I whispered, and an echo murmured back the word, \\"Lenore!\\" \u2014 Merely this, and nothing more","Democracy is a very admirable form of government - for dogs","And now was acknowledged the presence of the Red Death. He had come like a thief in the night. And one by one dropped the revelers in the blood-bedewed halls of their revel, and died each in the despairing posture of his fall. And the life of the ebony clock went out with that of the last of the gay. And the flames of the tripods expired. And Darkness and Decay and the Red Death held illimitable dominion over all.","[E]very plot, worth the name, must be elaborated to its d\xe9nouement before anything be attempted with the pen. It is only with the d\xe9nouement constantly in view that we can plot its indispensable air of consequence, or causation, by making the incidents, and especially the tone at all points tend to the development of the intention.","And my soul from out that shadow that lies floating on the floor, Shall be lifted -- Nevermore!","In other words, I believed, and still do believe, that truth, is frequently of its own essence, superficial, and that, in many cases, the depth lies more in the abysses where we seek her, than in the actual situations wherein she may be found.","You call it hope-that fire of fire! It is but agony of desire.","The death then of a beautiful woman is unquestionably the most poetical topic in the world, and equally is it beyond doubt that the lips best suited for such topic are those of a bereaved lover.","I have no faith in human perfectability. I think that human exertion will have no appreciable effect upon humanity. Man is now only more active - not more happy - nor more wise, than he was 6000 years ago.","We had always dwelled together, beneath a tropical sun, in the Valley of the Many Colored Grass.","Where the good and the bad and the worst and the best have gone to their eternal rest.","When, indeed, men speak of Beauty, they mean, precisely, not a quality, as is supposed, but an effect - they refer, in short, just to that intense and pure elevation of soul - not of intellect, or of heart.","You need not attempt to shake off or to banter off Romance. It is an evil you will never get rid of to the end of your days. It is a part of yourself ... of your soul. Age will only mellow it a little, and give it a holier tone.","And have I not told you that what you mistake for madness is but over-acuteness of the sense? --now, I say, there came to my ears a low, dull, quick sound, such as a watch makes when enveloped in cotton. I knew that sound well, too. It was the beating of the old man\'s heart. It increased my fury, as the beating of a drum stimulates the soldier into courage.","I was never kinder to the old man than during the whole week before I killed him.","The sole purpose is to provide infinite springs, at which the soul may allay the eternal thirst TO KNOW which is forever unquenchable within it, since to quench it, would be to extinguish the soul\'s self.","Children are never too tender to be whipped. Like tough beefsteaks, the more you beat them, the more tender they become.","Literature is the most noble of professions. In fact, it is about the only one fit for a man.","It is by no means an irrational fancy that, in a future existence, we shall look upon what we think our present existence, as a dream.","I felt that I breathed an atmosphere of sorrow.","I never can hear a crowd of people singing and gesticulating, all together, at an Italian opera, without fancying myself at Athens, listening to that particular tragedy, by Sophocles, in which he introduces a full chorus of turkeys, who set about bewailing the death of Meleager.","There are moments when, even to the sober eye of Reason, the world of our sad humanity must assume the aspect of Hell.","A man\'s grammar, like Caesar\'s wife, must not only be pure, but above suspicion of impurity.","With me poetry has not been a purpose, but a passion.","That single thought is enough. The impulse increases to a wish, the wish to a desire, the desire to an uncontrollable longing, and the longing (to the deep regret and mortification of the speaker, and in defiance of all consequences,) is indulged.","Indeed, there is an eloquence in true enthusiasm that is not to be doubted.","During the whole of a dull, dark, and soundless day in the autumn of the year, when the clouds hung oppressively low in the heavens, I had been passing alone, on horseback, through a singularly dreary tract of country; and at length found myself, as the shades of the evening drew on, within view of the melancholy House of Usher. I know not how it was - but, with the first glimpse of the building, a sense of insufferable gloom pervaded my spirit.","The true genius shudders at incompleteness.","Science has not yet taught us if madness is or is not the sublimity of the intelligence.","It is the nature of truth in general, as of some ores in particular, to be richest when most superficial.","Books, indeed, were his sole luxuries","It will be found, in fact, that the ingenious are always fanciful, and the truly imaginative never otherwise than analytic.","If any ambitious man have a fancy to revolutionize, at one effort, the universal world of human thought, human opinion, and human sentiment, the opportunity is his own -- the road to immortal renown lies straight, open, and unencumbered before him. All that he has to do is to write and publish a very little book. Its title should be simple -- a few plain words -- My Heart Laid Bare. But -- this little book must be true to its title.","Sensations are the great things, after all. Should you ever be drowned or hung, be sure and make a note of your sensations; they will be worth to you ten guineas a sheet.","It would be mockery to call such dreariness heaven at all.","Once upon a midnight dreary, while I pondered, weak and weary, Over many a quaint and curious volume of forgotten lore--While I nodded, nearly napping, suddenly there came a tapping, As if some one gently rapping, rapping at my chamber door. \\"\'Tis some visitor,\\" I muttered, \\"tapping at my chamber door--Only this and nothing more.","Decorum -- that bug-bear which deters so many from bliss until the opportunity for bliss has forever gone by.","In visions of the dark night I have dreamed of joy departed-- But a waking dream of life and light Hath left me broken-hearted.","Music, when combined with a pleasurable idea, is poetry; music, without the idea, is simply music; the idea, without the music, is prose, from its very definitiveness.","There was an iciness, a sinking, a sickening of the heart - an unredeemed dreariness of thought which no goading of the imagination could torture into aught of the sublime","I have made no money. I am as poor now as ever I was in my life - except in hope, which is by no means bankable.","I heed not that my earthly lot Hath - little of Earth in it - That years of love have been forgot In the hatred of a minute: - I mourn not that the desolate Are happier, sweet, than I, But that you sorrow for my fate Who am a passer by.","To speak algebraically, Mr. M. is execrable, but Mr. G. is (x + 1)- ecrable.","For years your name never passed my lips, while my soul drank in, with a delirious thirst, all that was uttered in my presence respecting you.","Beauty is the sole legitimate province of the poem.","There is something in the unselfish and self-sacrificing love of a brute, which goes directly to the heart of him who has had frequent occasion to test the paltry friendship and gossamer fidelity of mere Man.","In reading some books we occupy ourselves chiefly with the thoughts of the author; in perusing others, exclusively with our own.","No thinking being lives who, at some luminous point of his life of thought, has not felt himself lost amid the surges of futile efforts at understanding, or believing, that anything exists greater than his own soul.","The writer who neglects punctuation, or mispunctuates, is liable to be misunderstood for the want of merely a comma, it often occurs that an axiom appears a paradox, or that a sarcasm is converted into a sermonoid.","The idea of God, infinity, or spirit stands for the possible attempt at an impossible conception.","I was cautious in what I said before the young lady; for I could not be sure that she was sane; and, in fact, there was a certain restless brilliancy about her eyes that half led me to imagine she was not.","For my own part, I have never had a thought which I could not set down in words, with even more distinctness than that with which I conceived it.","The enormous multiplication of books in every branch of knowledge is one of the greatest evils of this age, since it presents one of the most serious obstacles to the acquisition of correct information by throwing in the reader\'s way piles of lumber in which he must painfully grope for the scraps of useful matter, peradventure interspersed.","The depth lies in the valleys where we seek her, and not upon the mountain-tops where she is found.","Whether people grow fat by joking, or whether there is something in fat itself which predisposes to a joke, I have never been quite able to determine.","There are few cases in which mere popularity should be considered a proper test of merit; but the case of song-writing is, I think, one of the few.","How many good books suffer neglect through the inefficiency of their beginnings!","After reading all that has been written, and after thinking all that can be thought, on the topics of God and the soul, the man who has a right to say that he thinks at all, will find himself face to face with the conclusion that, on these topics, the most profound thought is that which can be the least easily distinguished from the most superficial sentiment.","I have been happy, though in a dream. I have been happy-and I love the theme: Dreams! in their vivid colouring of life As in that fleeting, shadowy, misty strife","The most \'popular,\' the most \'successful\' writers among us (for a brief period, at least) are, 99 times out of a hundred, persons of mere effrontery-in a word, busy-bodies, toadies, quacks.","By the grey woods, by the swamp, where the toad and newt encamp, by the dismal tarns and pools, where dwell the Gouls.   By each spot the most unholy, by each nook most melancholy, there the traveller meets, aghast, sheeted memories of the Past.   Shrouded forms that  start and sigh, as they pass the wanderer by. White-robed forms of friends long given; In agony, to the Earth - and Heaven.","Were I called on to define, very briefly, the term Art, I should call it \'the reproduction of what the Senses perceive in Nature through the veil of the soul.\' The mere imitation, however accurate, of what is in Nature, entitles no man to the sacred name of \'Artist.\'","And the life of the ebony clock went out with that of the last of the gay. And the flames of the tripods expired. And Darkness and Decay and the Red Death held illimitable dominion over all.","Melancholy is ... the most legitimate of all the poetical tones.","There are certain themes of which the interest is all-absorbing, but which are too entirely horrible for the purposes of legitimate fiction.","That man is not truly brave who is afraid either to seem or to be, when it suits him, a coward.","A dirge for her the doubly dead in that she died so young.","From childhood\'s hour I have not been. As others were, I have not seen. As others saw, I could not awaken. My heart to joy at the same tone. And all I loved, I loved alone.","As a poet and as a mathematician, he would reason well; as a mere mathematician, he could not have reasoned at all.","I seemed to be upon the verge of comprehension, without the power to comprehend as men, at time, find themselves upon the brink of rememberance, without being able, in the end, to remember.","Come little children I\'ll take thee away, into a land of Enchantment Come little children the time\'s come to play here in my garden of Shadows Follow sweet children I\'ll show thee the way through all the pain and the Sorrows Weep not poor childlen for life is this way murdering beauty and Passions Hush now dear children it must be this way to weary of life and Deceptions Rest now my children for soon we\'ll away into the calm and the Quiet Come little children I\'ll take thee away, into a land of Enchantment Come little children the time\'s come to play here in my garden of Shadows","Even with the utterly lost, to whom life and death are equally jests, there are matters of which no jest can be made.","Grammar is the analysis of language.","Yet I am not more sure that my soul lives, than I am that perverseness is one of the primitive impulses of the human heart - one of the indivisible primary faculties, or sentiments, which give direction to the character of Man. Who has not, a hundred times, found himself committing a vile or a silly action, for no other reason than because he knows he should not? Have we not a perpetual inclination, in the teeth of our best judgment, to violate that which is Law, merely because we understand it to be such?","To be thoroughly conversant with Man\u2019s heart, is to take our final lesson in the iron-clasped volume of Despair","The customs of the world are so many conventional follies.","Thy soul shall find itself alone \u2019Mid dark thoughts of the gray tombstone\u2014 Not one, of all the crowd, to pry Into thine hour of secrecy. Be silent in that solitude, Which is not loneliness\u2014for then The spirits of the dead who stood In life before thee are again In death around thee\u2014and their will Shall overshadow thee: be still. [...]","There are some secrets which do not permit themselves to be told. Men die nightly in their beds, wringing the hands of ghostly confessors, and looking them piteously in the eyes - die with despair of heart and convulsion of throat, on account of the hideousness of mysteries which will not suffer themselves to be revealed. Now and then, alas, the conscience of man takes up a burden so heavy in horror that it can be thrown down only into the grave. And thus the essence of all crime is undivulged.","A million candles have burned themselves out. Still I read on. (Montresor)","One morning, in cool blood, I slipped a noose about its neck and hung it to the limb of a tree; \u2014 hung it with the tears streaming from my eyes, and with the bitterest remorse at my heart; \u2014 hung it because I knew that it had loved me, and because I felt it had given me no reason of offence; \u2014 hung it because I knew that in so doing I was committing a sin \u2014 a deadly sin that would so jeopardize my immortal soul as to place it \u2014 if such a thing were possible \u2014 even beyond the reach of the infinite mercy of the Most Merciful and Most Terrible God.","I hold that a long poem does not exist. I maintain that the phrase, \\"a long poem,\\" is simply a flat contradiction in terms.","The rudiment of verse may, possibly, be found in the spondee.","The analytical power should not be confounded with simple ingenuity; for while the analyst is necessarily ingenious, the ingenious man is often remarkably incapable of analysis.","Yes, Heaven is thine; but this Is a world of sweets and sours; Our flowers are merely\x97flowers.","In our endeavors to recall to memory something long forgotten, we often find ourselves upon the very verge of remembrance, without being able, in the end, to remember.","Yes I now feel that it was then on that evening of sweet dreams- that the very first dawn of human love burst upon the icy night of my spirit. Since that period I have never seen nor heard your name without a shiver half of delight half of anxiety.","If we cannot comprehend God in his visible works, how then in his inconceivable thoughts, that call the works into being?","If we examine a work of ordinary art, by means of a powerful microscope, all traces of resemblance to nature will disappear - but the closest scrutiny of the photogenic drawing discloses only a more absolute truth, a more perfect identity of aspect with the thing represented.","To him, who still would gaze upon the glory of the summer sun, there comes, when that sun will from him part, a sullen hopelessness of heart.","Take thy beak from out my heart, and take thy form from off my door!\u201d Quoth the raven, \u201cNevermore.","There are two bodies - the rudimental and the complete; corresponding with the two conditions of the worm and the butterfly. What we call \\"death,\\" is but the painful metamorphosis. Our present incarnation is progressive, preparatory, temporary. Our future is perfected, ultimate, immortal. The ultimate life is the full design.","It may well be doubted whether human ingenuity can construct an enigma... which human ingenuity may not, by proper application, resolve.","The greater amount of truth is impulsively uttered; thus the greater amount is spoken, not written.","A fool, for example, thinks Shakespeare a great poet . . . yet the fool has never read Shakespeare.","One half of the pleasure experienced at a theatre arises from the spectator\'s sympathy with the rest of the audience, and, especially from his belief in their sympathy with him.","Now this is the point. You fancy me a mad. Madmen know nothing. But you should have seen me. You should have seen how wisely I proceeded.","Yet, mad am I not \u2014 and very surely do I not dream.","I call to mind flatness and dampness; and then all is madness - the madness of a memory which busies itself among forbidden things.","Odors have an altogether peculiar force, in affecting us through association; a force differing essentially from that of objects addressing the touch, the taste, the sight or the hearing.","And Darkness and Decay and the Red Death held illimitable dominion over all.","In criticism I will be bold, and as sternly, absolutely just with friend and foe. From this purpose nothing shall turn me.","I have no words alas! to tell the loveliness of loving well","I found him well educated, with unusual powers of mind, but infected with misanthropy, and subject to perverse moods of alternate enthusiasm and melancholy.","Fill with mingled cream and amber, I will drain that glass again. Such hilarious visions clamber Through the chamber of my brain \u2014 Quaintest thoughts \u2014 queerest fancies Come to life and fade away; What care I how time advances? I am drinking ale today.","The higher powers of the reflective intellect are more decidedly and more usefully tasked by the unostentatious game of draughts than by all the elaborate frivolity of chess.","Men of genius are far more abundant than is supposed. In fact, to appreciate thoroughly the work of what we call genius, is to possess all the genius by which the work was produced.","There are few persons who have not, at some period of their lives, amused themselves in retracing the steps by which particular conclusions of their own minds have been attained. The occupation is often full of interest and he who attempts it for the first time is astonished by the apparently illimitable distance and incoherence between the starting-point and the goal.","I have not only labored solely for the benefit of others (receiving for myself a miserable pittance), but have been forced to model my thoughts at the will of men whose imbecility was evident to all but themselves","Imperceptibly the love of these discords grew upon me as my love of music grew stronger.","A wrong is unredressed when retribution overtakes its redresser. It is equally unredressed when the avenger fails to make himself felt as such to him who has done the wrong.","But in the expression of the countenance, which was beaming all over with smiles, there still lurked (incomprehensible anomalyl) that fitful strain of melancholy which will ever be found inseparable from the perfection of the beautiful.","In one case out of a hundred a point is excessively discussed because it is obscure; in the ninety-nine remaining it is obscure because it is excessively discussed.","But evil things, in robes of sorrow, Assailed the monarch\'s high estate; (Ah, let us mourn, for never morrow Shall dawn upon him desolate!) And round about his home the glory That blushed and bloomed, Is but a dim-remembered story Of the old time entombed.","True, nervous, very, very dreadfully nervous I had been and am, but why will say that I am mad?! The disease had haunted my senses, not destroyed, not dulled them. Of all the sense of hearing acute.","The result of law inviolate is perfection\u2013right\u2013negative happiness.

It was the radiance of an opium-dream - an airy and spirit-lifting vision more wildly divine than the fantasies which hovered about the slumbering souls of the daughters of Delos.","And now have I not told you that what you mistake for madness is but overacuteness of the senses?","And much of Madness, and more of Sin,\\nAnd Horror the soul of the plot.","It is clear that a poem may be improperly brief. Undue brevity degenerates into mere epigrammatism. A very short poem, while now and then producing a brilliant or vivid, never produces a profound or enduring, effect.

There is no passion in nature so demoniacally impatient, as that of him, who shuddering upon the edge of a precipice, thus meditates a plunge. To indulge for a moment, in any attempt at thought, is to be inevitably lost; for reflection but urges us to forbear, and therefore it is, I say, that we cannot. If there be no friendly arm to check us, or if we fail in a sudden effort to prostrate ourselves backward from the abyss, we plunge, and are destroyed.","Men die nightly in their beds, wringing the hands of ghostly confessors ... on account of the hideousness of mysteries which will not suffer themselves to be revealed.","...And, all at once, the moon arouse through the thin ghastly mist, And was crimson in color...

On the other hand, accuse an honorable man, too petinaciously, of being a villain, and you fill him with a perverse ambition to show you that you are not altogether in the wrong.","Believe me, there exists no such dilemma as that in which a gentleman is placed when he is forced to reply to a blackguard.","I need scarcely observe that a poem deserves its title only inasmuch as it excites, by elevating the soul. The value of the poem is in the ratio of this elevating excitement.

Thus, thus, and not otherwise, shall I be lost. I dread the events of the future, not in themselves, but in their results. I shudder at the thought of any, even the most trivial, incident, which may operate upon this intolerable agitation of soul. I have, indeed, no abhorrence of danger, except in its absolute effect-in terror. In this unnerved-in this pitiable condition-I feel that the period will sooner or later arrive when I must abandon life and reason together, in some struggle with the grim phantasm, FEAR.","He knew that Hop-Frog was not fond of wine; for it excited the poor cripple almost to madness; and madness is no comfortable feeling.","The goodness of your true pun is in the direct ratio of its intolerability.","Villains!\' I shrieked. \'Dissemble no more!

It was possible, I reflected, that a mere different arrangement of the particulars of the scene, of the details of the picture, would be sufficient to modify, or perhaps to annihilate its capacity for sorrowful impression.","And the Raven, never flitting, still is sitting, still is sitting...","Sound--\\nThat stealeth ever on the ear of him\\nWho, musing, gazeth on the distance dim,\\nAnd sees the darkness coming as a cloud--\\nIs not its form--its voice--most palpable and loud?","A change fell upon all things. Strange brilliant flowers, star-shaped, burst out upon the trees where no flowers had been before.

That holy dream- that holy dream,      While all the world were chiding, Hath cheered me as a lovely beam      A lonely spirit guiding.

In their gray visions they obtain glimpses of eternity, and thrill, in waking, to find that they have been upon the verge of the great secret. In snatches, they learn something of the wisdom which is of good, and more of the mere knowledge which is of evil.","Scorching my seared heart with a pain, not hell shall make me fear again.","The want of an international Copy-Right Law, by rendering it nearly impossible to obtain anything from the booksellers in the wayof remuneration for literary labor, has had the effect of forcing many of our very best writers into the service of the Magazines and Reviews.","The fever called \\"living\\" Is conquer\'d at last.","If I venture to displace ... the microscopical speck of dust... on the point of my finger,...

Indeed, phenomena have there occurred of a nature so completely unexpected--so entirely novel--so utterly at variance with preconceived opinions--as to leave no doubt on my mind that long ere this all Europe is in an uproar, all physics in a ferment, all reason and astronomy together by the ears.","As for Republicanism, no analogy could be found for it upon the face of the earth\u2014unless we except the case of the \\"prairie dogs,\\" an exception which seems to demonstrate, if anything, that democracy is a very admirable form of government\u2014for dogs.","A fearful instance of the ill consequences attending upon irascibility - alive, with the qualifications of the dead - dead, with the propensities of the living - an anomaly on the face of the earth - being very calm, yet breathless.","Ah, broken is the golden bowl! the spirit flown forever!

III Hear the loud alarum bells - Brazen bells! What a tale of terror, now, their turbulency tells! In the startled ear of night How they scream out their affright! Too much horrified to speak, They can only shriek, shriek, Out of tune, In a clamorous appealing to the mercy of the fire, In a mad expostulation with the deaf and frantic fire, Leaping higher, higher, higher, With a desperate desire, And a resolute endeavor Now - now to sit, or never, By the side of the pale - faced moon. Oh, the bells, bells, bells! What a tale their terror tells Of Despair! How they clang, and clash and roar! What a horror they outpour On the bosom of the palpitating air! Yet the ear, it fully knows, By the twanging, And the clanging, How the danger ebbs and flows; Yet the ear distinctly tells, In the jangling, And the wrangling, How the danger sinks and swells, By the sinking or the swelling in the anger of the bells - Of the bells - Of the bells, bells, bells, bells, Bells, bells, bells - In the clamor and the clanging of the bells! IV Hear the tolling of the bells - Iron bells! What a world of solemn thought their monody compels! In the silence of the night, How we shiver with affright At the melancholy menace of their tone! For every sound that floats From the rust within their throats Is a groan. And the people - ah, the people - They that dwell up in the steeple, All alone, And who, tolling, tolling, tolling, In that muffled monotone, Feel a glory in so rolling On the human heart a stone - They are neither man nor woman - They are neither brute nor human - They are Ghouls: - And their king it is who tolls: - And he rolls, rolls, rolls, Rolls A paean from the bells! And his merry bosom swells With the paean of the bells! And he dances, and he yells; Keeping time, time, time, In a sort of Runic rhyme, To the paean of the bells: - Of the bells: Keeping time, time, time In a sort of Runic rhyme, To the throbbing of the bells - Of the bells, bells, bells: - To the sobbing of the bells: - Keeping time, time, time, As he knells, knells, knells, In a happy Runic rhyme, To the rolling of the bells - Of the bells, bells, bells - To the tolling of the bells - Of the bells, bells, bells, bells, Bells, bells, bells, - To the moaning and the groaning of the bells.","The scariest monsters are the ones that lurk within our souls...","In criticism, I will be bold, and as sternly, absolutely just with friend and foe.

I know not how it was--but, with the first glimpse of the building, a sense of insufferable gloom pervaded my spirit. I say insufferable; for the feeling was unrelieved by any of that half-pleasureable, because poetic, sentiment, with which the mind usually receives even the sternest natural images of the desolate or terrible. I looked upon the scene before me--upon the mere house, and the simple landscape features of the domain--upon the bleak walls--upon the vacant eye-like windows--upon a few rank sedges--and upon a few white trunks of decayed trees--with an utter depression of soul which I can compare to no earthly sensation more properly than to the after-dream of the reveller upon opium--the bitter lapse into everyday life--the hideous dropping off of the veil.

To-morrow arrives, and with it a more impatient anxiety to do our duty, but with this very increase of anxiety arrives, also, a nameless, a positively fearful, because unfathomable, craving for delay. This craving gathers strength as the moments fly. The last hour for action is at hand. We tremble with the violence of the conflict within us, \u2014 of the definite with the indefinite \u2014 of the substance with the shadow. But, if the contest have proceeded thus far, it is the shadow which prevails, \u2014 we struggle in vain. The clock strikes, and is the knell of our welfare. At the same time, it is the chanticleer-note to the ghost that has so long overawed us. It flies \u2014 it disappears \u2014 we are free. The old energy returns. We will labor now.

If wise, he has not fashioned his thoughts to accommodate his incidents; but having conceived, with deliberate care, a certain unique or single effect to be wrought out, he then invents as may best aid him in establishing this preconceived effect. If his very initial sentence tend not to the outbringing of this effect, then he has failed in his first step. In the whole composition there should be no words written, of which the tendency, direct or indirect, is not to the one pre-established design. And by such means, with such care and skill, a picture is at length painted which leaves in the mind of him who contemplates it with a kindred art, a sense of the fullest satisfaction. The idea of the tale has been presented unblemished because undisturbed: and this is an end unattainable by the novel. Undue brevity is just as exceptionable here as in the poem; but undue length is yet more to be avoided.","Out- out are the lights- out all!

You should have seen how wisely I proceeded \u2013with what caution \u2013with what foresight \u2013with what dissimulation I went to work! I was never kinder to the old man than during the whole week before I killed him. And every night, about midnight, I turned the latch of his door and opened it \u2013oh so gently! And then, when I had made an opening sufficient for my head, I put in a dark lantern, all closed, closed, so that no light shone out, and then I thrust in my head. Oh, you would have laughed to see how cunningly I thrust it in! I moved it slowly \u2013very, very slowly, so that I might not disturb the old man\'s sleep. It took me an hour to place my whole head within the opening so far that I could see him as he lay upon his bed. Ha! \u2013would a madman have been so wise as this? And then, when my head was well in the room, I undid the lantern cautiously \u2013oh, so cautiously \u2013cautiously (for the hinges creaked) \u2013I undid it just so much that a single thin ray fell upon the vulture eye. And this I did for seven long nights \u2013every night just at midnight \u2013but I found the eye always closed; and so it was impossible to do the work; for it was not the old man who vexed me, but his Evil Eye. And every morning, when the day broke, I went boldly into the chamber, and spoke courageously to him, calling him by name in a hearty tone, and inquiring how he has passed the night. So you see he would have been a very profound old man, indeed, to suspect that every night, just at twelve, I looked in upon him while he slept.","The LakeIn spring of youth it was my lotTo haunt of the wide world a spotThe which I could not love the less-So lovely was the lonelinessOf a wild lake, with black rock bound,And the tall pines that towered around.But when the Night had thrown her pallUpon that spot, as upon all,And the mystic wind went byMurmuring in melody-Then-ah then I would awakeTo the terror of the lone lake.Yet that terror was not fright,But a tremulous delight-A feeling not the jewelled mineCould teach or bribe me to define-Nor Love-although the Love were thine.Death was in that poisonous wave,And in its gulf a fitting graveFor him who thence could solace bringTo his lone imagining-Whose solitary soul could makeAn Eden of that dim lake.","I blush, I burn, I shudder, while I pen the damnable atrocity.","And, when the friendly sunshine smil\'d, / And she would mark the opening skies, / I saw no Heaven--but in her eyes.","From childhood\'s hour I have not beenAs others were; I have not seenAs others saw","And travellers, now, within that valley,  Through the red-litten windows see Vast forms, that move fantastically  To a discordant melody, While, like a ghastly rapid river,  Through the pale door A hideous throng rush out forever  And laugh \u2014 but smile no more.","I am SHADOW, and my dwelling is near to theCatacombs of Ptolemais, and hard by those dim plains of Helusionwhich border upon the foul Charonian canal.\\" And then did we, theseven, start from our seats in horror, and stand trembling, andshuddering, and aghast, for the tones in the voice of the shadow werenot the tones of any one being, but of a multitude of beings, and,varying in their cadences from syllable to syllable fell duskly uponour ears in the well-remembered and familiar accents of many thousanddeparted friends.","Be nothing which thou art not","Ah, not in knowledge is happiness, but in the acquisition of knowledge!

Than young Hope in his sunniest hour hath known.","Shadows of Shadows passing... It is now 1831... and as always, I am absorbed with a delicate thought. It is how poetry has indefinite sensations to which end, music is an essential, since the comprehension of sweet sound is our most indefinite conception. Music, when combined with a pleasurable idea, is poetry. Music without the idea is simply music. Without music or an intriguing idea, color becomes pallour, man becomes carcass, home becomes catacomb, and the dead are but for a moment motionless.","And thus, as a closer and still closer intimacy admitted me more unreservedly into recesses if his spirit, the more bitterly did I perceive the futility of all attempt at cheering a mind from which darkness, as if an inherent positive quality, poured forth upon all objects of the moral and physical universe in one unceasing radiation of gloom.","You are not wrong, who deemThat my days have been a dream...All that we see or seemIs but a dream within a dream.","Ah, broken is the golden bowl! the spirit flown forever!Let the bell toll!-a saintly soul floats on the Stygian river;And, Guy de Vere, hast thou no tear?-weep now or nevermore!","That motley drama\u2014oh, be sure  It shall not be forgot!With its Phantom chased for evermore  By a crowd that seize it not,Through a circle that ever returneth in  To the self-same spot,And much of Madness, and more of Sin,  And Horror the soul of the plot.","It is impossible to say how first the idea entered my brain; but once conceived, it haunted me day and night. Object there was none. Passion there was none. I loved the old man. He had never wronged me. He had never given me insult. For his gold I had no desire. I think it was his eye! yes, it was this! He had the eye of a vulture \u2013a pale blue eye, with a film over it. Whenever it fell upon me, my blood ran cold; and so by degrees \u2013 very gradually \u2013I made up my mind to take the life of the old man, and thus rid myself of the eye forever.","After all, what is it?- this indescribable something which men will persist in terming \\"genius\\"? I agree with Buffon- with Hogarth- it is but diligence after all.Look at me!- how I labored- how I toiled- how I wrote! Ye Gods, did I not write? I knew not the word \\"ease.\\" By day I adhered to my desk, and at night, a pale student, I consumed the midnight oil. You should have seen me- you should. I leaned to the right. I leaned to the left. I sat forward. I sat backward. I sat tete baissee (as they have it in the Kickapoo), bowing my head close to the alabaster page. And, through all, I- wrote. Through joy and through sorrow, I-wrote. Through hunger and through thirst, I-wrote. Through good report and through ill report- I wrote. Through sunshine and through moonshine, I-wrote. What I wrote it is unnecessary to say. The style!- that was the thing. I caught it from Fatquack- whizz!- fizz!- and I am giving you a specimen of it now.","It is evident that we are hurrying onward to some exciting knowledge\u2014some never-to-be-imparted secret, whose attainment is destruction.","Take this kiss upon the brow!And, in parting from you now,Thus much let me avow-You are not wrong, who deemThat my days have been a dream;All that we see or seemIs but a dream within a dream.","And so, being young and dipt in follyI fell in love with melancholy,And used to throw my earthly restAnd quiet all away in jest\u2014I could not love except where DeathWas mingling his with Beauty\'s breath\u2014Or Hymen, Time, and DestinyWere stalking between her and me.","There are moments when, even to the sober eye of Reason, the world of our sad Humanity may assume the semblance of a Hell-but the imagination of man is no Carathis, to explore with impunity its every cavern. Alas! the grim sepulchral terrors cannot be regarded as altogether fanciful-but, like the Demons in whose company Afrasiab made his voyage down the Oxus, they must sleep, or they will devour us-they must be suffered to slumber, or we perish.","Misery is manifold. The wretchedness of earth is multiform. Overreaching the wide horizon as the rainbow, its hues are as various as the hues of that arch, --as distinct too, yet as intimately blended. Overreaching the wide horizon as the rainbow! How is it that from beauty I have derived a type of unloveliness? --from the covenant of peace a simile of sorrow? But as, in ethics, evil is a consequence of good, so, in fact, out of joy is sorrow born. Either the memory of past bliss is the anguish of to-day, or the agonies which are have their origin in the ecstasies which might have been.","I was especially fond of animals, and was indulged by my parents with a great variety of pets. With these I spent most of my time, and never was so happy as when feeding and caressing them.This peculiarity of character grew with my growth, I derived from it one of my principal sources of pleasure.","For all we live to know is known.","There are two bodies \u2014 the rudimental and the complete; corresponding with the two conditions of the worm and the butterfly.

We are wearied with everlasting sameness. Come drink! the wine will brighten your wits.","The history of human knowledge has so uninterruptedly shown that to collateral, or incidental, or accidental events we are indebted for the most numerous and most valuable discoveries, that it has at length become necessary, in any prospective view of improvement, to make not only large, but the largest allowances for inventions that shall arise by chance, and quite out of the range of ordinary expectation. It is no longer philosophical to base, upon what has been, a vision of what is to be. Accident is admitted as a portion of the substructure. We make chance a matter of absolute calculation. We subject the unlooked for and unimagined, to the mathematical formulae of the schools.","Doubting, dreaming dreams no mortal ever dared to dream before","For eyes we have no models in the remotely antique.","It was many and many a year ago,In a kingdom by the sea,That a maiden there lived whom you may knowBy the name of ANNABEL LEE;And this maiden she lived with no other thoughtThan to love and be loved by me","Such, I have long known, is the paradoxical law of all sentiments having terror as a basis.","Alas! for that accursed timeThey bore thee o\'er the billow,From love to titled age and crime,And an unholy pillow!From me, and from our misty clime,Where weeps the silver willow!","Be silent in that solitude \xa0\xa0 Which is not loneliness - for then The spirits of the dead who stood \xa0\xa0 In life before thee are again In death around thee - and their will Shall then overshadow thee: be still.","LO!

It is not more true in the former, that a large body is with more difficulty set in motion than a smaller one, and that its subsequent momentum is commensurate with this difficulty, than it is, in the latter, that intellects of the vaster capacity, while more forcible, more constant, and more eventful in their movements than those of inferior grade, are yet the less readily moved, and more embarrassed, and full of hesitation in the first few steps of their progress","I do believe God gave me a spark of genius, but he quenched it in misery.","Reaching out to her is like drinking from a memory.","In the sepulchre there by the sea,In her tomb by the sounding sea.","Baz\u0131 kitaplar\u0131 okurken yazar\u0131n d\xfc\u015f\xfcncelerine dal\u0131p gideriz, baz\u0131lar\u0131n\u0131 okurken de kendi d\xfc\u015f\xfcncelerimize.","Ugh! ugh! ugh!\u2014ugh! ugh! ugh!\u2014ugh! ugh! ugh!\u2014ugh! ugh! ugh!\u2014ugh! ugh! ugh!","...the question is of will, and not, as the insanity of logic has assumed, of power.

The Italians have but little sentiment beyond marbles and colors. In France, meliora probant, deteriora sequuntur -- the people are too much a race of gadabouts to maintain those household proprieties of which, indeed, they have a delicate appreciation, or at least the elements of a proper sense. The Chinese and most of the Eastern races have a warm but inappropriate fancy. The Scotch are poor decorists. The Dutch have, perhaps, an indeterminate idea that a curtain is not a cabbage. In Spain, they are all curtains -- a nation of hangmen. The Russians do not furnish. The Hottentots and Kickapoos are very well in their way. The Yankees alone are preposterous.","Tal vez sea la propia simplicidad del asunto lo que nos conduce al error.","Leave my loneliness unbroken!\u2014quit the bust above my door!","e minha alma dessa sombra que no ch\xe3o h\xe1 mais e mais, libertar-se-\xe1...

That which he considered chief was (strange to say!) the simple and purely physical one of free exercise in the open air. \\"The health,\\" he said, \\"attainable by other means is scarcely worth the name.\\" He instanced the ecstasies of the fox hunter, and pointed to the tillers of the earth, the only people who, as a class, can be fairly considered happier than others. His second condition was love of woman. His third, and most difficult of realization, was the contempt of ambition. His fourth was an object of unceasing pursuit; and he held that, other things being equal, the extent of attainable happiness was in proportion to the spirituality of this object.","Coincidences, in general, are great stumbling-blocks in the way of that class of thinkers who have been educated to know nothing of the theory of probabilities---that theory to which the most glorious objects of human research are indebted for the most glorious of illustration.","But the raven, sitting lonely on the placid bust, spoke only That one word, as if his soul in that one word he did outpour.","She was a maiden of rarest beauty, and not more lovely than full of glee.

He might see, perhaps, one or two points with unusual clearness, but in so doing he, necessarily, lost sight of the matter as a whole. Thus there is such a thing as being too profound. Truth is not always in a well. In fact, as regards the more important knowledge, I do believe that she is invariably superficial. The depth lies in the valleys where we seek her, and not upon the mountain-tops where she is found.","By a route obscure and lonelyHaunted by ill angels only.","Ah, dream too bright to last!

I know not how it was; but, with the first glimpse of the building, a sense of insufferable gloom pervaded my spirit. I say insufferable; for the feeling was unrelieved by any of that half-pleasurable, because poetic, sentiment, with which the mind usually receives even the sternest natural images of the desolate or terrible. I looked upon the scene before me\u2014upon the mere house, and the simple landscape features of the domain\u2014upon the bleak walls\u2014upon the vacant eye-like windows\u2014upon a few rank sedges\u2014and upon a few white trunks of decayed trees\u2014with an utter depression of soul which I can compare to no earthly sensation more properly than to the after-dream of the reveler upon opium\u2014the bitter lapse into every-day life\u2014the hideous dropping off of the veil. There was an iciness, a sinking, a sickening of the heart\u2014an unredeemed dreariness of thought which no goading of the imagination could torture into aught of the sublime. What was it\u2014I paused to think\u2014what was it that so unnerved me in the contemplation of the House of Usher? It was a mystery all insoluble; nor could I grapple with the shadowy fancies that crowded upon me as I pondered. I was forced to fall back upon the unsatisfactory conclusion that while, beyond doubt, there are combinations of very simple natural objects which have the power of thus affecting us, still the analysis of this power lies among considerations beyond our depth. It was possible, I reflected, that a mere different arrangement of the particulars of the scene, of the details of the picture, would be sufficient to modify, or perhaps to annihilate its capacity for sorrowful impression; and, acting upon this idea, I reined my horse to the precipitous brink of a black and lurid tarn that lay in unruffled luster by the dwelling, and gazed down\u2014but with a shudder even more thrilling than before\u2014upon the remodeled and inverted images of the gray sedge, and the ghastly tree stems, and the vacant and eye-like windows.","Not altogether a fool,\\" said G., \\"but then he\'s a poet, which I take to be only one remove from a fool.\\"\\"True,\\" said Dupin, after a long and thoughtful whiff from his meerschaum, \\"although I have been guilty of certain doggerel myself.","With such precautions the courtiers might bid defiance to contagion.

Best known for his tales of the macabre and mystery, Poe was one of the early American practitioners of the short story and a progenitor of detective fiction and crime fiction. He is also credited with contributing to the emergent science fiction genre.Poe died at the age of 40. The cause of his death is undetermined and has been attributed to alcohol, drugs, cholera, rabies, suicide (although likely to be mistaken with his suicide attempt in the previous year), tuberculosis, heart disease, brain congestion and other agents.

Yet to calculate is not in itself to analyse. A chess-player, for example, does the one without effort at the other. It follows that the game of chess, in its effects upon mental character, is greatly misunderstood. I am not now writing a treatise, but simply prefacing a somewhat peculiar narrative by observations very much at random; I will, therefore, take occasion to assert that the higher powers of the reflective intellect are more decidedly and more usefully tasked by the unostentatious game of draughts than by a the elaborate frivolity of chess. In this latter, where the pieces have different and bizarre motions, with various and variable values, what is only complex is mistaken (a not unusual error) for what is profound. The attention is here called powerfully into play. If it flag for an instant, an oversight is committed resulting in injury or defeat. The possible moves being not only manifold but involute, the chances of such oversights are multiplied; and in nine cases out of ten it is the more concentrative rather than the more acute player who conquers. In draughts, on the contrary, where the moves are unique and have but little variation, the probabilities of inadvertence are diminished, and the mere attention being left comparatively unemployed, what advantages are obtained by either party are obtained by superior acumen. To be less abstract, let us suppose a game of draughts where the pieces are reduced to four kings, and where, of course, no oversight is to be expected. It is obvious that here the victory can be decided (the players being at all equal) only by some recherch\xe9 movement, the result of some strong exertion of the intellect. Deprived of ordinary resources, the analyst throws himself into the spirit of his opponent, identifies himself therewith, and not unfrequently sees thus, at a glance, the sole methods (sometime indeed absurdly simple ones) by which he may seduce into error or hurry into miscalculation.","Horrors of a nature most stern and most appalling would too frequently obtrude themselves upon my mind, and shake the innermost depths of my soul with the bare supposition of their possibility.","And rays of truth you cannot seeAre flashing thro\' Eternity--","And his brow was lofty with thought, and his eye wild with care; and, in the few furrows upon his cheek I read the fables of sorrow, and weariness, and disgust with mankind, and a longing after solitude.","We will say, then, that I am mad.

Music, when combined with a pleasurable idea, is poetry; music without the idea is simply music; the idea without the music is prose from its very definitiveness.","...something which, for want of a more definite term at present, I must be permitted to be called queer; but which Mr. Coleridge would have called mystical, Mr. Kant pantheistical, Mr. Carlyle twistical, and Mr. Emerson hyperquizzitistical.","Proprieties of place, and especially of time, are the bugbears which terrify mankind from the contemplation of the magnificent.","In no affairs of mere prejudice, pro or con, do we deduce inferences with entire certainty, even from the most simple data.","O God! can I not saveOne from the pitiless wave?","On desperate seas long wont to roam,Thy hyacinth hair, thy classic face,Thy Naiad airs have brought me homeTo the glory that was Greece,And the grandeur that was Rome.","I assert, however, that much of our incredulity\u2014as La Bruyere says of all our unhappiness\u2014\\"vient de ne pouvoir \xeatre seuls.","Prophet! said I, \u201cthing of evil!\xa0\u2014 prophet still, if bird or devil!\xa0\u2014\u201d","Not altogether a fool,\\" said G., \\"but then he\'s a poet, which I take to be only one remove from a fool.","Presently my soul grew stronger; hesitating then no longer,\\"Sir,\\" said I, \\"or Madam, truly your forgiveness I implore;But the fact is I was napping, and so gently you came rapping,And so faintly you came tapping, tapping at my chamber door,That I scarce was sure I heard you\\"\u2014here I opened wide the door;\u2014Darkness there, and nothing more.","Igual que en la \xe9tica el mal es consecuencia del bien, en realidad de la alegr\xeda nace la tristeza. O la memoria de la dicha pasada es la angustia de hoy, o las agon\xedas que son se originan en los \xe9xtasis que pudieron haber sido.","R\xe1na bi\u010dem zp\u016fsob\xed mod\u0159inu, ale r\xe1na jazykem drt\xed kosti.","In short, I never yet encountered the mere mathematician who could be trusted out of equal roots, or one who did not clandestinely hold it as a point of his faith that x squared + px was absolutely and unconditionally equal to q. Say to one of these gentlemen, by way of experiment, if you please, that you believe occasions may occur where x squared + px is not altogether equal to q, and, having made him understand what you mean, get out of his reach as speedily as convenient, for, beyond doubt, he will endeavor to knock you down.","we then busied our souls in dreams\u2014reading, writing, or conversing, until warned by the clock of the advent of the true Darkness.","I. In the greenest of our valleys, By good angels tenanted, Once a fair and stately palace - Radiant palace - reared its head. In the monarch Thought\'s dominion - It stood there ! Never seraph spread a pinion Over fabric half so fair. II. Banners yellow, glorious, golden, On its roof did float and flow; (This - all this - was in the olden Time long ago) And every gentle air that dallied, In that sweet day, Along the ramparts plumed and pallid, A winged odor went away. III. Wanderers in that happy valley Through two luminous windows saw Spirits moving musically To a lute\'s well-tun\xe9d law, Round about a throne, where sitting (Porphyrogene !) In state his glory well befitting, The ruler of the realm was seen. IV. And all with pearl and ruby glowing Was the fair palace door, Through which came flowing, flowing, flowing, And sparkling evermore, A troop of Echoes whose sweet duty Was but to sing, In voices of surpassing beauty, The wit and wisdom of their king. V. But evil things, in robes of sorrow, Assailed the monarch\'s high estate ; (Ah, let us mourn, for never morrow Shall dawn upon him, desolate !) And, round about his home, the glory That blushed and bloomed Is but a dim-remembered story Of the old time entombed. VI. And travellers now within that valley, Through the red-litten windows, see Vast forms that move fantastically To a discordant melody ; While, like a rapid ghastly river, Through the pale door, A hideous throng rush out forever, And laugh - but smile no more.","...but in the next moment I cursed myself for being so great a fool as to dream of hope at all.","The secret of a poem, no less than a jest\'s prosperity, lies in the ear of him that hears it.","Mimes in the form of God on high mutter and mumble low and hither and tither fly, mere puppets they who come and go.","To look at a star by glances\u2014to view it in a side-long way, by turning toward it the exterior portions of the retina (more susceptible of feeble impressions of light than the interior), is to behold the star distinctly\u2014is to have the best appreciation of its lustre\u2014a lustre which grows dim just in proportion as we turn our vision fully upon it. A greater number of rays actually fall upon the eye in the latter case, but in the former, there is the more refined capacity for comprehension. By undue profundity we perplex and enfeeble thought; and it is possible to make even Venus herself vanish from the firmament by a scrutiny too sustained, too concentrated, or too direct.","En los corazones de los hombres m\xe1s temerarios hay cuerdas que no se dejan tocar sin emoci\xf3n.","Other friends have flown before-- On the morrow he will leave me, as my hopes have flown before.","Yet if Hope has flown awayIn a night, or in a day, In a vision, or in none,Is it therefore the less gone?All that we see or seemIs but a dream within a dream.","The look on his face frightened me terribly, but at the same time I was pleased not to be alone any more.","It is in Music, perhaps, that the soul most nearly attains the great end for which, when inspired by the Poetic Sentiment, it struggles\u2014the creation of supernal Beauty.","Ero costretto a limitarmi a una conclusione abbastanza insoddisfacente cio\xe8, che certamente esistono combinazioni di oggetti semplicissimi, naturali fino alla banalit\xe0, che hanno il potere di impressionarci, ma che, nello stesso tempo, tale potere resta per noi non analizzabile, superiore al potere della nostra mente.","Lo! \'tis a gala nightWithin the lonesome latter years! An angel throng, bewinged, bedightIn veils, and drowned in tears,Sit in a theatre, to seeA play of hopes and fears [...]","There is no exquisite beauty,\\" says Bacon, Lord Verulam, speaking truly of all the forms and genera of beauty, \\"without some strangeness in the proportion.","Ah, bear in mind this garden was enchanted!","What chance \u2014 what one event brought this evil thing to pass, bear with me while I relate. Death approaches; and the shadow which foreruns him has thrown a softening influence over my spirit. I long, in passing through the dim valley, for the sympathy \u2014 I had nearly said for the pity \u2014 of my fellow men. I would fain have them believe that I have been, in some measure, the slave of circumstances beyond human control.","Yet I am not more sure that my soul lives, than I am that perverseness is one of the primitive impulses of the human heart - one of the indivisible primary faculties, or sentiments, which give direction to the character of man.","Science has its place in man\u2019s search for understanding, but science and the imagination have tended to bifurcate in the modern world; only the true poetic intellect can end this long-established dualism.","It is the desire of the moth for the star. It is no mere appreciation of the Beauty before us \u2013 but a wild effort to reach the Beauty above. Inspired by an ecstatic prescience of the glories beyond the grave, we struggle, by multiform combinations among the things and thoughts of Time, to attain a portion of that Loveliness whose very elements, perhaps, appertain to eternity alone.","From childhood\'s hour I have not been as others were; I have not seen as others saw.","Les quatre conditions \xe9l\xe9mentaires du bonheur sont : la vie en plein air, l\'amour d\'une femme, le d\xe9tachement de toute ambition et la cr\xe9ation d\'un Beau nouveau.","L\'uomo non cede agli angeli, n\xe9 interamente alla morte, se non a causa della fiacchezza della sua minuscola volont\xe0","Las realidades del mundo terrestre me afectaron como visiones, s\xf3lo como visiones, mientras las extra\xf1as ideas del mundo de los sue\xf1os, por el contrario, se tornaron no en materia de mi existencia cotidiana, sino realmente en mi c\xednica y total existencia.","And all I loved, I loved alone","Who entereth herein, a conqueror hath bin; Who slayeth the dragon, the shield he shall win.","I stand amid the roarOf a surf-tormented shore,And I hold within my handGrains of the golden sand-How few! yet how they creepThrough my fingers to the deep,While I weep- while I weep!O God! can I not graspThem with a tighter clasp?O God! can I not saveOne from the pitiless wave?Is all that we see or seemBut a dream within a dream? \u2015 A Dream Within a Dream\u201d","Dark draperies hung upon the walls. The general furniture was profuse, comfortless, antique, and tattered. Many books and musical instruments lay scattered about, but failed to give any vitality to the scene. I felt that I breathed an atmosphere of sorrow. An air of stern, deep, and irredeemable gloom hung over and pervaded all.","Never its mysteries are exposedTo the weak human eye unclosed","I would have soothed-I would have reasoned; but, in the intensity of her wild desire for life,-for life-but for life-solace and reason were the uttermost folly.","But it is easier to be generous than to be just,","Chi sogna di giorno conosce molte cose che sfuggono a chi sogna solo di notte.","You are rich, respected, admired, beloved; you are happy, as once I was.","\xc9 um facto que um homem engenhoso \xe9 sempre fantasista, enquanto o homem verdadeiramente imaginativo \xe9, no fundo, um analista.","Hayal kuranlar, sadece geceleri d\xfc\u015f g\xf6renlerin g\xf6zden ka\xe7\u0131rd\u0131\u011f\u0131 pek \xe7ok \u015feyi fark eder.","There comes a sullenness of heartTo him who still would look uponThe glory of the summer sun.","The memory of a past happiness is the anguish of today","The \u201cRed Death had long devastated the country. No pestilence had ever been so fatal, or so hideous. Blood was its Avator and its seal \u2014 the redness and the horror of blood. There were sharp pains, and sudden dizziness, and then profuse bleeding at the pores, with dissolution. The scarlet stains upon the body and especially upon the face of the victim, were the pest ban which shut him out from the aid and from the sympathy of his fellow-men. And the whole seizure, progress and termination of the disease, were the incidents of half an hour.\u201d","But the memory of past sorrow--is it not present joy?","In visions of the dark night \xa0I have dream\'d of joy departed\u2014 But a waking dream of life and light \xa0Hath left me broken-hearted.

I knew myself no longer. My original soul seemed, at once, to take its flight from my body and a more than fiendish malevolence, gin-nurtured, thrilled every fibre of my frame.","THE LAKE IN youth\'s spring it was my lot To haunt of the wide earth a spot The which I could not love the less; So lovely was the loneliness Of a wild lake, with black rock bound, And the tall pines that tower\'d around. But when the night had thrown her pall Upon that spot\u2014as upon all, And the wind would pass me by In its stilly melody, My infant spirit would awake To the terror of the lone lake. Yet that terror was not fright\u2014 But a tremulous delight, And a feeling undefined, Springing from a darken\'d mind. Death was in that poison\'d wave And in its gulf a fitting grave For him who thence could solace bring To his dark imagining; Whose wildering thought could even make An Eden of that dim lake.","But my disease grew upon me\u2014for what disease is like Alcohol!","The days have never been when thou couldst love me\u2014but her whom in life thou didst abhor, in death thou shalt adore.","I have been happy, tho\' [but] in a dream.

But alas! the real sleepers were fewer, by many millions, than those who slumbered not at all; and there was a feebly struggling; and there was a general and sad unrest; and from out of the depths of the countless pits there came a melancholy rustling from the garments of the buried.","All in the immediate vicinity of the ship, is the blackness of eternal night, and a chaos of foamless water; but, about a league on either side of us, may be seen, indistinctly and at intervals, stupendous ramparts of ice, towering away into the desolate sky, and looking like the walls of the universe.","This accident, with the loss of my insurance, and with the more serious loss of my hair, - the whole of which had been singed off by fire, - predisposed me to serious impressions, so that, finally, I made up my mind to take a wife.","I love me a good sheep.","Once upon a midnight dreary, while I pondered, weak and weary, \xa0Over many a quaint and curious volume of forgotten lore, \xa0While I nodded, nearly napping, suddenly there came a tapping, \xa0As of some one gently rapping, rapping at my chamber door. \xa0\\"\'Tis some visiter,\\" I muttered, \\"tapping at my chamber door\u2014 \xa0\xa0 \xa0 \xa0 \xa0 \xa0 \xa0 \xa0 \xa0 \xa0 \xa0 \xa0 \xa0 \xa0Only this, and nothing more.","would a madman have been so wise as this?","He did not perceive that my smile now was at the thought of his immolation.","There may be a class of beings, human once, but now invisible to humanity, to whom, from afar, our disorder may seem order\u2014our unpicturesqueness picturesque, in a word, the earth-angels, for whose scrutiny more especially than our own, and for whose death\u2014refined appreciation of the beautiful, may have been set in array by God the wide landscape-gardens of the hemispheres.","It is a happiness to wonder;\u2014it is a happiness to dream","With my aversion to this cat, however, its partiality for myself seemed to increase.","I must not only punish, but punish with impunity. A wrong is unredressed when retribution overtakes its redresser. It is equally unredressed when the avenger fails to make himself felt as such to him who has done the wrong.","Because it was my crime to have no one on Earth who cared for me, or loved me.","I heard all things in the heaven and in the earth. I heard many things in hell. How, then, am I mad?","These repeated insults were not to be endured by an imperious nobility. Such invitations became less cordial\u2014less frequent\u2014in time they ceased altogether. The widow of the unfortunate Count Berlifitzing was even heard to express a hope \\"that the Baron might be at home when he did not wish to be at home, since he disdained the company of his equals; and ride when he did not wish to ride, since he preferred the society of a horse.\\" This to be sure was a very silly explosion of hereditary pique; and merely proved how singularly unmeaning our sayings are apt to become, when we desire to be unusually energetic.","How often we forget all time, when lone Admiring Nature\u2019s universal throne; Her woods\u2014her wilds\u2014her mountains\u2014the intense Reply of HERS to OUR intelligence!","I rapped, as was my custom,","The viol, the violet, and the vine.

Who, like all of us, believed he was sane.","During the whole of the dull, dark and soundless day in the autumn of the year, when the clouds hung oppressively low in the heavens, I had been passing alone, on horseback, through a singularly dreary tract of country, and at length found myself as the shades of evening drew on, within view of the melancholy House of Usher.","And what are we to think, I asked,\\"of the article in Le Soleil?\\"\\"That it is a vast pity its inditer was not born a parrot--in which case he would have been the most illustrious parrot of his race.","if passion it can properly be called, was of the most thoroughly romantic, shadowy, and imaginative character.

Any maiden, not immediately and positively repulsive,","it has the force of a frame to a picture","Did there not cross your mind some thought of the physical power of words? Is not every word an impulse on the air?","I have said that the sole effect of my somewhat childish experiment\u2014that of looking down within the tarn\u2014had been to deepen the first singular impression. There can be no doubt that the consciousness of the rapid increase of my superstition\u2014for why should I not so term it?\u2014served mainly to accelerate the increase itself. Such, I have long known, is the paradoxical law of all sentiments having terror as a basis.","Villains! I shrieked, \u201cdissemble no more!

And his brow was lofty with thought, and his eye wild with care; and, in the few furrows upon his cheek I read the fables of sorrow, and weariness, and disgust with mankind, and a longing after solitude.","He who has never swooned, is not he who finds strange palaces and wildly familiar faces in coals that glow; is not he who beholds floating in mid-air the sad visions that the many may not view; is not he who ponders over the perfume of some novel flower -- is not he whose brain grows bewildered with the meaning of some musical cadence which has never before arrested his attention.","Here, at last, he is happy.","Very suddenly there came back to my soul motion and sound\u2014the tumultuous motion of the heart, and, in my ears, the sound of its beating. Then a pause in which all is blank. Then again sound, and motion, and touch\u2014a tingling sensation pervading my frame. Then the mere consciousness of existence, without thought\u2014a condition which lasted long. Then, very suddenly, thought, and shuddering terror, and earnest endeavor to comprehend my true state. Then a strong desire to lapse into insensibility.","Y, entonces, abr\xed la puerta de par en par, y \xbfqu\xe9 es lo que vi? \xa1Las tinieblas y nada m\xe1s!","And who shall calculate the immense influence upon social life--upon arts--upon commerce--upon literature--which will be the immediate result of the great principles of electro-magnetics!","I have graven it within the hills, and my vengeance upon the dust within the rock.","Men usually grow base by degrees.","Leave no black plume as a token of that lie thy soul hath spoken!

You should have seen how careful I was to put the body where no one could find it. First I cut off the head, then the arms and the legs. I was careful not to let a single drop of blood fall on the floor. I pulled up three of the boards that formed the floor, and put the pieces of the body there. Then I put the boards down again, care fully, so carefully that no human eye could see that they had been moved.","In my own heart there dwells no faith in praeternature. That Nature and its God are two, no man who thinks, will deny. That the latter, creating the former, can, at will, control or modify it, is also unquestionable. I say \\"at will\\"; for the question is of will, and not, as the insanity of logic has assumed, of power. It is not that the Deity cannot modify his laws, but that we insult him in imagining a possible necessity for modification. In their origin these laws were fashioned to embrace all contingencies which could lie in the Future. With God all is Now.","A feeling, for which I have no name, has taken possession of my soul \u2014a sensation which will admit of no analysis, to which the lessons of bygone times are inadequate, and for which I fear futurity itself will offer me no key. To a mind constituted like my own, the latter consideration is an evil. I shall never\u2014I know that I shall never\u2014be satisfied with regard to the nature of my conceptions. Yet it is not wonderful that these conceptions are indefinite, since they have their origin in sources so utterly novel. A new sense\u2014a new entity is added to my soul.","The giant will succumbed to a power more stern.","TRUE!\u2014nervous\u2014very, very dreadfully nervous I had been and am; but why will you say that I am mad?

How, then, am I mad? Hearken! and observe how healthily\u2014how calmly I can tell you the whole story.","But, for myself, the Earth\u2019s records had taught me to look for widest ruin as the price of highest civilization.","Misery is manifold.

III. Wanderers in that happy valley Through two luminous windows saw Spirits moving musically To a lute\u2019s well-timed law; Round about a throne, where sitting (Porphyrogene!) In state his glory well befitting, The ruler of the realm was seen. IV. And all with pearl and ruby glowing Was the fair palace door, Through which came flowing, flowing, flowing And sparkling evermore, A troop of Echoes whose sweet duty Was but to sing, In voices of surpassing beauty, The wit and wisdom of their king. V. But evil things, in robes of sorrow, Assailed the monarch\u2019s high estate; (Ah, let us mourn, for never morrow Shall dawn upon him, desolate!) And, round about his home, the glory That blushed and bloomed Is but a dim-remembered story Of the old time entombed. VI.

We peer into the abyss\u2014we grow sick and dizzy. Our first impulse is to shrink from the danger. Unaccountably we remain. By slow degrees our sickness and dizziness and horror become merged in a cloud of unnamable feeling. By gradations, still more imperceptible, this cloud assumes shape, as did the vapor from the bottle out of which arose the genius in the Arabian Nights. But out of this our cloud upon the precipice\u2019s edge, there grows into palpability, a shape, far more terrible than any genius or any demon of a tale, and yet it is but a thought, although a fearful one, and one which chills the very marrow of our bones with the fierceness of the delight of its horror. It is merely the idea of what would be our sensations during the sweeping precipitancy of a fall from such a height. And this fall\u2014this rushing annihilation\u2014for the very reason that it involves that one most ghastly and loathsome of all the most ghastly and loathsome images of death and suffering which have ever presented themselves to our imagination\u2014for this very cause do we now the most vividly desire it. And because our reason violently deters us from the brink, therefore do we the most impetuously approach it. There is no passion in nature so demoniacally impatient, as that of him who, shuddering upon the edge of a precipice, thus meditates a Plunge. To indulge, for a moment, in any attempt at thought, is to be inevitably lost; for reflection but urges us to forbear, and therefore it is, I say, that we cannot. If there be no friendly arm to check us, or if we fail in a sudden effort to prostrate ourselves backward from the abyss, we plunge, and are destroyed.","A singularity apart from the others.Another more beautiful singularity.Found love between the two.

This mist, or spray, was no doubt occasioned by the clashing of the great walls of the funnel, as they all met together at the bottom-but the yell that went up to the Heavens from out of that mist, I dare not attempt to describe.","...Aln\u0131na konsun bu \xf6p\xfc\u015f!Ve, \u015fimdi senden ayr\u0131l\u0131rken,\u0130tiraf edeyim ki-G\xfcnlerimi bir d\xfc\u015fSayarken yan\u0131lm\u0131yorsun;Ama, umut gitmi\u015fse uzaklaraBir gece ya da bir g\xfcnBir g\xf6r\xfcnt\xfcde ya da bir \u015feyde olmaks\u0131z\u0131nFark eder mi bu y\xfczden?B\xfct\xfcn g\xf6rd\xfc\u011f\xfcm\xfcz ve g\xf6r\xfcnd\xfc\u011f\xfcm\xfczYaln\u0131zca bir d\xfc\u015f i\xe7inde bir d\xfc\u015f.","For some months I had been ill in health, but was now convalescent, and, with returning strength, found myself in one of those happy moods which are so precisely the converse of ennui \u2014 moods of the keenest appetency, when the film from the mental vision departs \u2014 the \u03b1\u03c7\u03bb\u03c5\u03c2 \u03bf\u03c2 \u03c0\u03c1\u03b9\u03bd \u03b5\u03c0\u03b7\u03b5\u03bd \u2014 and the intellect, electrified, surpasses as greatly its every-day condition, as does the vivid yet candid reason of Leibnitz, the mad and flimsy rhetoric of Gorgias.

This ledge projected about eighteen inches, and was not more than a foot wide, while a niche in the cliff just above it, gave it a rude resemblance to one of the hollow-backed chairs used by our ancestors.

They who dream by day are cognizant of many things which escape those who dream only by night. In their grey visions they obtain glimpses of eternity, and thrill, in awaking, to find that they have been upon the verge of the great secret.

Never seraph spread a pinion Over fabric half so fair. II. Banners yellow, glorious, golden, On its roof did float and flow; (This\u2014all this\u2014was in the olden Time long ago) And every gentle air that dallied, In that sweet day, Along the ramparts plumed and pallid, A winged odor went away. III. Wanderers in that happy valley Through two luminous windows saw Spirits moving musically To a lute\'s well-tun\xe9d law, Round about a throne, where sitting (Porphyrogene!) In state his glory well befitting, The ruler of the realm was seen. IV. And all with pearl and ruby glowing Was the fair palace door, Through which came flowing, flowing, flowing, And sparkling evermore, A troop of Echoes whose sweet duty Was but to sing, In voices of surpassing beauty, The wit and wisdom of their king. V. But evil things, in robes of sorrow, Assailed the monarch\'s high estate; (Ah, let us mourn, for never morrow Shall dawn upon him, desolate!) And, round about his home, the glory That blushed and bloomed Is but a dim-remembered story Of the old time entombed. VI. And travellers now within that valley, Through the red-litten windows, see Vast forms that move fantastically To a discordant melody; While, like a rapid ghastly river, Through the pale door, A hideous throng rush out forever, And laugh\u2014but smile no more.","Desde aquel momento las pocas dudas que pod\xeda haber tenido sobre la demencia de mi pobre amigo se disiparon por completo.","me acaricia.

These were, indeed, the ne plus ultra of good legs. Every connoisseur in such matters admitted the legs to be good. There was neither too much flesh, nor too little,\u2014neither rudeness nor fragility.
