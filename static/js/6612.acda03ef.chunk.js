One does not become enlightened by imagining figures of light, but by making the darkness conscious. The most terrifying thing is to accept oneself completely. Your visions will become clear only when you can look into your own heart. Who looks outside, dreams; who looks inside, awakes.","Do not compare, do not measure. No other way is like yours. All other ways deceive and tempt you. You must fulfill the way that is in you.","Until you make the unconscious conscious, it will direct your life and you will call it fate.","Invited or not, God is present.","VOCATUS ATQUE NON VOCATUS DEUS ADERIT.","It is a bewildering thing in human life that the things that cause the greatest fear is the source of the greatest wisdom.","We are not what happened to us, we are what we wish to become.","Please remember, it is what you are that heals, not what you know.","The most dangerous things in the world are immense accumulations of human beings who are manipulated by only a few heads.","Life really does begin at forty. Up until then, you are just doing research.","Who looks outside, dreams; who looks inside, awakes.","The foundation of all mental illness is the unwillingness to experience legitimate suffering.","The difference between a good life and a bad life is how well you walk through the fire","Be grateful for your difficulties and challenges, for they hold blessings. In fact... Man needs difficulties; they are necessary for health personal growth, individuation and self-actualisation.","Real liberation comes not from glossing over or repressing painful states of feeling, but only from experiencing them to the full.","The whole point of Jesus\'s life was not that we should become exactly like him, but that we should become ourselves in the same way he became himself. Jesus was not the great exception but the great example.","You must go in quest of yourself, and you will find yourself again only in the simple and forgotten things.","To ask the right question is already half the solution of a problem.","God enters through the wound.","Nothing affects the life of a child so much as the unlived life of its parent","Shame is a soul eating emotion.","The brighter the light, the darker the shadow.","In every adult there lurks a child\u2014 an eternal child, something that is always becoming, is never completed, and calls for unceasing care, attention, and education. That is the part of the personality which wants to develop and become whole.","People will do anything, no matter how absurd, in order to avoid facing their own souls. They will practice Indian yoga and all its exercises, observe a strict regimen of diet, learn the literature of the whole world - all because they cannot get on with themselves and have not the slightest faith that anything useful could ever come out of their own souls.","Everyone you meet knows something you don\'t know but need to know.  Learn from them.","You always become the thing you fight the most.","Everything that irritates us about others can lead us to an understanding of ourselves.","The privilege of a lifetime is to become who you truly are.","If our religion is based on salvation, our chief emotions will be fear and trembling. If our religion is based on wonder, our chief emotion will be gratitude.","No tree, it is said, can grow to heaven unless its roots reach down to hell.","Embrace your grief. For there, your soul will grow.","The ability to ask questions is the greatest resource in learning the truth.","Your vision will become clear only when you can look into your own heart. Who looks outside, dreams; who looks inside, awakes.","We don\'t really heal anything; we simply let it go.","To be normal is the ultimate aim of the unsuccessful.","Children are educated by what the grown-up is and not by his talk.","Knowing your own darkness is the best method for dealing with the darknesses of other people.","A man likes to believe that he is the master of his soul. But as long as he is unable to control his moods and emotions, or to be conscious of the myriad secret ways in which unconscious factors insinuate themselves into his arrangements and decisions, he is certainly not his own master.","We don\'t get wounded alone and we don\'t heal alone.","Normality is a fine ideal for those who have no imagination.","Conflict exists strictly as an opportunity to raise our consciousness.","We cannot change anything until we accept it. Condemnation does not liberate, it oppresses.","The first half of life is devoted to forming a healthy ego, the second half is going inward and letting go of it.","Solitude is for me a fount of healing which makes my life worth living. Talking is often a torment for me, and I need many days of silence to recover from the futility of words.","A man\'s hatred is always concentrated upon that which makes him conscious of his bad qualities.","I have frequently seen people become neurotic when they content themselves with inadequate or wrong answers to the questions of life. They seek position, marriage, reputation, outward success of money, and remain unhappy and neurotic even when they have attained what they were seeking. Such people are usually confined within too narrow a spiritual horizon. Their life has not sufficient content, sufficient meaning. If they are enabled to develop into more spacious personalities, the neurosis generally disappears.","The most important question anyone can ask is: What myth am I living?","Loneliness does not come from having no people about one, but from being unable to communicate the things that seem important to oneself, or from holding certain views which others find inadmissible.","You are what you do, not what you say you\'ll do.","Synchronicity is an ever present reality for those who have eyes to see.","When goals go, meaning goes. When meaning goes, purpose goes. When purpose goes, life goes dead on our hands.","If a man knows more than others, he becomes lonely.","The best political, social, and spiritual work we can do is to withdraw the projection of our shadow onto others.","I cannot define for you what God is. I can only say that my work has proved empirically that the pattern of God exists in every man and that this pattern has at its disposal the greatest of all his energies for transformation and transfiguration of his natural being. Not only the meaning of his life but his renewal and his institutions depend on his conscious relationship with this pattern of his collective unconscious.","Wisdom accepts that all things have two sides","Trust that which gives you meaning and accept it as your guide","The gigantic catastrophes that threaten us today are not elemental happenings of a physical or biological order, but psychic events. To a quite terrifying degree we are threatened by wars and revolutions which are nothing other than psychic epidemics. At any moment several million human beings may be smitten with a new madness, and then we shall have another world war or devastating revolution. Instead of being at the mercy of wild beasts, earthquakes, landslides, and inundations, modern man is battered by the elemental forces of his own psyche.","The meeting of two personalities is like the contact of two chemical substances: if there is any reaction, both are transformed.","The reason for evil in the world is that people are not able to tell their stories.","Hurry is not of the devil; hurry is the devil.","Intuition is one of the four basic psychological functions along with thinking, feeling,and sensing.","We meet ourselves time and again in a thousand disguises on the path of life.","The most terrifying thing is to accept oneself completely.","The sad truth is that man\'s real life consists of a complex of inexorable opposites - day and night, birth and death, happiness and misery, good and evil. We are not even sure that one will prevail against the other, that good will overcome evil, or joy defeat pain. Life is a battleground. It always has been and always will be; and if it were not so, existence would come to an end.","Our world has become dehumanized. Man feels himself isolated in the cosmos, because he is no longer involved in nature.","What you resist persist.","In all chaos there is a cosmos, in all disorder a secret order.","If people can be educated to see the lowly side of their own natures, it may be hoped that they will also learn to understand and to love their fellow men better. A little less hypocrisy and a little more tolerance towards oneself can only have good results in respect for our neighbor; for we are all too prone to transfer to our fellows the injustice and violence we inflict upon our own natures.","No matter what the world thinks about religious experience, the one who has it possesses a great treasure, a thing that has become for him a source of life, meaning, and beauty, and that has given a new splendor to the world and to mankind.","Whenever we touch nature we get clean. People who have got dirty through too much civilization take a walk in the woods, or a bath in the sea. Entering the unconscious, entering yourself through dreams, is touching nature from the inside and this is the same thing, things are put right again.","Life calls not for perfection, but for completeness.","One looks back with appreciation to the brilliant teachers, but with gratitude to those who touched our human feelings. The curriculum is so much necessary raw material, but warmth is the vital element for the growing plant and for the soul of the child.","Nothing is possible without love ... For love puts one in a mood to risk everything.","Only a life lived in a certain spirit is worth living. It is a remarkable fact that a life lived entirely from the ego is dull not only for the person himself but for all concerned.","Filling the conscious mind with ideal conceptions is a characteristic of Western theosophy, but not the confrontation with the Shadow and the world of darkness. One does not become enlightened by imagining figures of light, but by making the darkness conscious. The latter procedure, however, is disagreeable and therefore not popular.","Sometimes a tree tells you more than can be read in books.","Only one who has risked the fight with the dragon and is not overcome by it wins the \\"treasure hard to attain.\\" He alone has a genuine claim to self-confidence, for he has faced the dark ground of his self and thereby has gained himself. This experience gives him faith and trust.","The descent into the depths always seems to precede the ascent.","Freedom stretches only as far as the limits of our consciousness.","In each of us is another whom we do not know. He speaks to us in dreams and tells us how differently he sees us from the way we see ourselves.","As a child I felt myself to be alone, and I am still, because I know things and must hint at things which others apparently know nothing of, and for the most part do not want to know.","Twelve experts gathered in one room equal one big idiot.","We discover ourselves through others.","What did you do as a child that made that hours pass like minutes? [Herein lies the key to your earthy pursuits.]","Where love stops, power begins, and violence, and terror","In order to know the light, we must first experience the darkness.","As far as we can discern, the sole purpose of human existence is to kindle a light of meaning in the darkness of mere being.\\nYour vision will become clear only when you look into your heart ... Who looks outside, dreams. Who looks inside, awakens.\\nThe dream is the small hidden door in the deepest and most intimate sanctum of the soul, which opens to that primeval cosmic night that was soul long before there was conscious ego and will be soul far beyond what a conscious ego could ever reach.","People will do anything, no matter how absurd, to avoid facing their own souls.","We cannot change anything unless we accept it.","That which we do not confront in ourselves we will meet as fate.","True art is creation, and creation is beyond all theories. That is why I say to any beginner: Learn your theories as well as you can, but put them aside when you touch the miracle of the living soul. Not theories but your own creative individuality alone must decide.","Sensation tell us a thing is. Thinking tell us what it is this thing is. Feeling tells us what this thing is to us.","One finds one\'s destiny on the path one takes to avoid it.","All fanaticism is repressed doubt.","If you are unhappy, you are too high up in your mind.","I\'ve realized that somebody who\'s tired and needs a rest, and goes on working all the same is a fool.","I feel very strongly that I am under the influence of things or questions which were left incomplete and unanswered by my parents and grandparents and more distant ancestors. It often seems as if there were an impersonal karma within a family which is passed on from parents to children. It has always seemed to me that I had to answer questions which fate had posed to my forefathers, and which had not yet been answered, or as if I had to complete, or perhaps continue, things which previous ages had left unfinished.","Our western mind lacking all culture in this respect, has never yet devised a concept, not even a name for \\"the union of opposites through the middle path\\", that most fundamental item of inward experience which could respectably be set against the Chinese concept of Tao.","Life is a luminous pause between two mysteries that are yet one.","Whenever we give up, leave behind, and forget too much, there is always the danger that the things we have neglected will return with added force","It is only our deeds that reveal who we are.","Where wisdom reigns, there is no conflict between thinking and feeling.","The greatest sin is to be unconscious.","Intuition is perception via the unconscious that brings forth ideas, images, new possibilities and ways out of blocked situations.","Observance of customs and laws can very easily be a cloak for a lie so subtle that our fellow human beings are unable to detect it. It may help us to escape all criticism, we may even be able to deceive ourselves in the belief of our obvious righteousness. But deep down, below the surface of the average man\'s conscience, he hears a voice whispering, \'There is something not right,\' no matter how much his rightness is supported by public opinion or by the moral code.","The creative process is a living thing, implanted, as it were in the souls of men.","The healthy man does not torture others - generally it is the tortured who turn into torturers.","The man who promises everything is sure to fulfil nothing, and everyone who promises too much is in danger of using evil means in order to carry out his promises, and is already on the road to perdition.","The more veiled becomes the outside world, steadily losing in colour, tone and passions, the more urgently the inner world calls us","The only thing we have to fear on this planet is man.","The artist is not a person endowed with free will who seeks his own ends, but one who allows it to realize its supreme purpose through him.","As far as we can discern, the sole purpose of human existence is to kindle a light in the darkness of mere being.","Nothing has a stronger influence psychologically on their environment and especially on their children than the unlived life of the parent.","We don\'t so much solve our problems as we outgrow them. We add capacities and experiences that eventually make us bigger than the problems.","Perhaps, I myself am the enemy who needs to be loved.","It is the individual\'s task to differentiate himself from all the others and stand on his own feet. All collective identities . . . interfere with the fulfillment of this task. Such collective identities are crutches for the lame, shields for the timid, beds for the lazy, nurseries for the irresponsible. . . .","The world begins to exist when the individual discovers it.","The artist\'s life cannot be otherwise than full of conflicts, for two forces are at war within him [or her]-on the one hand, the common human longing for happiness, satisfaction and security in life, and on the other a ruthless passion for creation which may go so far as to override every personal desire ... There are hardly any exceptions to the rule that a person must pay dearly for the divine gift of creative fire.","Even a happy life cannot be without a measure of darkness, and the word happy would lose its meaning if it were not balanced by sadness. It is far better take things as they come along with patience and equanimity.","If there is anything that we wish to change in the child, we should first examine it and see whether it is not something that could better be changed in ourselves.","If God wishes to be born as man and to unite mankind in the fellowship of the Holy Ghost, He suffers the terrible torment of having to bear the world in its reality. It is a crux; indeed, He Himself is His own cross. The world is God\'s suffering, and every individual human being who wishes even to approach his own wholeness knows very well that this means bearing his own cross. But the eternal promise for him who bears his own cross is the Paraclete.","It is high time that we realized that it is pointless to praise the light and preach it if nobody can see it. It is much more needful to preach the art of seeing.","I cannot prove to you that God exists, but my work has proved empirically that the pattern of God exists in every man and that this pattern in the individual has at its disposal the greatest transforming energies of which life is capable. Find this pattern in your own individual self and life is transformed.","Show me a sane man and I will cure him for you.","A man who has not passed through the inferno of his passions has never overcome them.","I could not say I believe. I know! I have had the experience of being gripped by something that is stronger than myself, something that people call God.","Enlightenment doesnt occur from sitting around visualizing images of light, but from integrating the darker aspects of the Self into the conscious personality.","An inflated consciousness is always egocentric and conscious of nothing but its own existence. It is incapable of learning from the past, incapable of understanding contemporary events, and incapable of drawing right conclusions about the future. It is hypnotized by itself and therefore cannot be argued with. It inevitably dooms itself to calamities that must strike it dead.","I know only that I was born and exist, and it seems to me that I have been carried along. I exist on the foundation of something I do not know. In spite of all uncertainties, I feel a solidity underlying all existence and a continuity in my mode of being.","When you succeed in awakening the Kundalini, so that it starts to move out of its mere potentiality, you necessarily start a world which is totally different from our world. It is the world of eternity.","The shoe that fits one person pinches another; there is no recipe for living that suits all cases.","Every human life contains a potential, if that potential is not fulfilled, then that life was wasted.","One cannot live without inconsistency.","When you are up against a wall, put down roots like a tree, until clarity comes from deeper sources to see over that wall and grow.","What happens after death is so unspeakably glorious that our imagination and our feelings do not suffice to form even an approximate conception of it. The dissolution of our time-bound form in eternity brings no loss of meaning.","You are a slave of what you need in your soul.","It all depends on how we look at things, and not how they are in themselves.","I am astonished, disappointed, pleased with myself. I am distressed, depressed, rapturous. I am all these things at once, and cannot add up the sum. I am incapable of determining ultimate worth or worthlessness; I have no judgment about myself and my life. There is nothing I am quite sure about. I have no definite convictions - not about anything, really. I know only that I was born and exist, and it seems to me that I have been carried along. I exist on the foundation or something I do not know.","Most of our difficulties come from losing contact with our instincts, with the age-old forgotten wisdom stored up in us.","To become acquainted with oneself is a terrible shock.","Whenever you hear anyone talking about a cultural or even about a human problem, you should never forget to inquire who the speaker really is. The more general the problem, the more the person will smuggle his or her own personal psychology into the account he or she gives of it.","I must also have a dark side if I am to be whole.","Unfortunately, there can be no doubt that man is, on the whole, less good than he imagines himself or wants to be. Everyone carries a shadow, and the less it is embodied in the individual\'s conscious life, the blacker and darker it is. If an inferiority is conscious, one always has a chance to correct it","The creation of something new is not accomplished by the intellect but by the play instinct acting from inner necessity. The creative mind plays with the objects it loves.","All true things must change and only that which changes remains true.","Shadow work is the path of the heart warrior.","The greater the contrast, the greater the potential. Great energy only comes from a correspondingly great tension of opposites.","Perfection belongs to the Gods; the most \\n we can hope for is excellence.","For better to come, good must stand aside.","Wholeness is not achieved by cutting off a portion of one\u2019s being, but by integration of the contraries.","Every form of addiction is bad, no matter whether the narcotic be alcohol or morphine or idealism.","The divine process of change manifests itself to our human understanding . . . as punishment, torment, death, and transfiguration.","Masses are always breeding grounds of psychic epidemics.","Only a fool is interested in other people\'s guilt, since he cannot alter it. The wise man learns only from his own guilt. He will ask himself: Who am I that all this should happen to me? To find the answer to this fateful question he will look into his own heart.","We deem those happy who from the experience of life have learnt to bear its ills without being overcome by them.","When one is not understood one should as a rule lower one\'s voice, because when one really speaks loudly enough and is not heard, it is because people do not want to hear. One had better begin to mutter to oneself, then they get curious.","Our intellect has achieved the most tremendous things, but in the meantime our spiritual dwelling has fallen into disrepair.","Consciousness succumbs all too easily to unconscious influences, and these are often truer and wiser than our conscious thinking.","It is often tragic to see how blatantly a man bungles his own life and the lives of others yet remains totally incapable of seeing how much the whole tragedy originates in himself, and how he continually feeds it and keeps it going. Not consciously, of course\u2014for consciously he is engaged in bewailing and cursing a faithless world that recedes further and further into the distance. Rather, it is an unconscious factor which spins the illusions that veil his world. And what is being spun is a cocoon, which in the end will completely envelop him.","Midlife is the time to let go of an overdominant ego and to contemplate the deeper significance of human existence.","Good does not become better by being exaggerated, but worse; And a small evil becomes a big one through being disregarded and repressed.","Neurosis is the suffering of a soul which has not discovered its meaning.","One is always in the dark about one\'s own personality. One needs others to get to know oneself.","...anyone who attempts to do both, to adjust to his group and at the same time pursue his individual goal, becomes neurotic.","One must be able to let things happen.","I shall not commit the fashionable stupidity of regarding everything I cannot explain as a fraud.","Mistakes are, after all, the foundations of truth, and if a man does not know what a thing is, it is at least an increase in knowledge if he knows what it is not.","The more one sees of human fate and the more one examines its secret springs of action, the more one is impressed by the strength of unconscious motives and by the limitations of free choice","Imagination is a concentrated extract of all the forces of life.","The true leader is always led.","It is in the nature of political bodies always to see the evil in the opposite group, just as the individual has an ineradicable tendency to get rid of everything he does not know and does not want to know about himself by foisting it off on somebody else. Nothing has a more diverse and alienating effect upon society than this moral complacency and lack of responsibility, and nothing promotes understanding and rapprochement more than the mutual withdrawal of projections.","That which you do not bring to consciousness comes to you as your Fate, that which you do bring to consciousness, whether it was what you thought you wanted or not, is your destiny.","Warmth is the vital element for the growing plant and for the soul of the child.","Much of the evil in the world is due to the fact that man in general is hopelessly unconscious.","A complex is a cluster of energy in the unconscious, charged by historic events, reinforced through repitition, embodying a fragment of our personality, and generating a programmed response and an implicit set of expectations.","Somewhere there was once a Flower, a Stone, a Crystal, a Queen, a King, a Palace, a Lover and his Beloved, and this was long ago, on an Island somewhere in the ocean 5,000 years ago. . . . Such is Love, the Mystic Flower of the Soul. This is the Center, the Self.","You must live life in such a spirit that you make in every moment the best of possibilities.","All the works of man have their origin in creative fantasy. What right have we then to depreciate imagination.","In each of us there is another whom we do not know. He speaks to us in dreams and tells us how differently he sees us from the way we see ourselves. When, therefore, we find ourselves in a difficult situation to which there is no solution, he can sometimes kindle a light that radically alters our attitude - the very attitude that led us into the difficult situation.","The symbol in the dream has more the value of a parable: it does not conceal, it teaches.","Commendation heals; condemnation destroys.","How can I be substantial if I do not cast a shadow? I must have a dark side also If I am to be whole","Modern man is sick because he is not whole.","We all must do what Christ did. We must make our experiment. We must make mistakes. We must live out our own version of life. And there will be error. If you avoid error you do not live.","It is really the mistake of our age. We think it is enough to discover new things, but we don\'t realize that knowing more demands a cor\xadresponding development of morality.","Without this playing with fantasy no creative work has ever yet come to birth. The debt we owe to the play of the imagination is incalculable.","Real work is completed in silence and strikes a chord in the minds of only a very few.","The unconscious psyche believes in life after death","We know that the wildest and most moving dramas are played not in the theatre but in the hearts of ordinary men and women.","To find out what is truly individual in ourselves, profound reflection is needed; and suddenly we realize how uncommonly difficult the discovery of individuality is.","Words are animals, alive with a will of their own","The dream is the small hidden door in the deepest and most intimate sanctum of the soul.","Synchronicity: A meaningful coincidence of two or more events where something other than the probability of chance is involved.","There are all too many who, on account of their notorious ineptitude, thrive better in a rationalist system than in freedom. Freedom is one of those difficult things.","It is a fact that cannot be denied: the wickedness of others becomes our own wickedness because it kindles something evil in our own hearts.","I cannot love anyone if I hate myself. That is the reason why we feel so extremely uncomfortable in the presence of people who are noted for their special virtuousness, for they radiate an atmosphere of the torture they inflict on themselves. That is not a virtue but a vice.","Remember that the only God man comes in contact with is his own God, called Spirit, Soul and Mind, or Consciousness, and these three are one.","The secret to Hitler\'s power is ... that his unconscious has exceptional access to his conscious and ... that he allows himself to be moved by it. [Others] have too much rationality, too much cerebrum to obey it [but] Hitler listens.","Somewhere, right at the bottom of one\u2019s own being, one generally does know where one should go and what one should do. But there are times when the clown we call \u201cI\u201d behaves in such a distracting fashion that the inner voice cannot make its presence felt.","But what if I should discover that the least amongst them all, the poorest of all beggars, the most impudent of all offenders, yea the very fiend himself\u2014 that these are within me, and that I myself stand in need of the alms of my own kindness, that I myself am the enemy who must be loved\u2014 what then?","If a union is to take place between opposites like spirit and matter, conscious and unconscious, bright and dark, and so on, it will happen in a third thing, which represents not a compromise but something new.","The experience of the self is always a defeat for the ego.","It is my mind, with its store of images, that gives the world color and sound; and that supremely real and rational certainty which I can \\"experience\\" is, in its most simple form, an exceedingly complicated structure of mental images. Thus there is, in a certain sense, nothing that is directly experienced except the mind itself. Everything is mediated through the mind, translated, filtered, allegorized, twisted, even falsified by it. We are . . . enveloped in a cloud of changing and endlessly shifting images.","The capacity for inner dialogue is a touchstone for outer objectivity.","Nothing worse could happen to one than to be completely understood.","Man cannot stand a meaningless life.","Nature does not deceive or conceal, but reveals.","Contemporary man is blind to the fact that, with all his rationality and efficiency, he is possessed by \\"powers\\" that are beyond his control. His gods and demons have not disappeared at all; they have merely got new names. They keep him on the run with restlessness, vague apprehensions, psychological complications, an insatiable need for pills, alcohol, tobacco, food - and, above all, a large array of neuroses","One does not become enlightened by imagining figures of light, but by making the darkness conscious.","Just as we tend to assume that the world is as we see it, we naively suppose that people are as we imagine them to be.","Neurosis is the natural by-product of pain avoidance.","The conscious mind allows itself to be trained like a parrot, but the unconscious does not \u2014 which is why St. Augustine thanked God for not making him responsible for his dreams.","Sometimes you have to do something unforgivable just to be able to go on living.","Whenever there is a reaching down into innermost experience, into the nucleus of personality, most people are overcome by fear and many run away. . . The risk of inner experience, the adventure of the spirit, is in any case alien to most human beings.  The possibility that such experience might have psychic reality is anathema to them.","We should not pretend to understand the world only by the intellect. The judgement of the intellect is only part of the truth.","Anyone who wants to know the human psyche will learn next to nothing from experimental psychology. He would be better advised to abandon exact science, put away his scholar\'s gown, bid farewell to his study, and wander with human heart through the world.","The psychopathology of the masses is rooted in the psychology of the individual","Only by discovering alchemy have I clearly understood that the Unconscious is a process and that ego\'s rapport with the Unconscious and its contents initiate an evolution, more precisely, a real metamorphosis of the psyche.","I have always tried to make room for anything that wanted to come to me from within.","Every living soul has different talents, different desires, different faculties. Be yourself, for even if you deceive the entire world, you will be ten thousand times worse than nothing.","The wise man who is not heeded is counted a fool, and the fool who proclaims the general folly first and loudest passes for a prophet and F\xfchrer, and sometimes it is luckily the other way round as well, or else mankind would long since have perished of stupidity.","Religion is a defense against the experience of God.","Where love rules, there is no will to power; and where power predominates, there love is lacking. The one is the shadow of the other.","...the soul does not require the organs of sense in order to see, hear, smell, taste and feel, in a much more perfect state; but with this great difference, that in such a state, it stands in much nearer connection with the spirtual than the material world.","To me dreams are part of nature, which harbors no intention to deceive but expresses something as best it can.","But we cannot live the afternoon of life according to the programme of life\'s morning \u2014 for what was great in the morning will be little at evening, and what in the morning was true will at evening have become a lie.","Man needs difficulties; they are necessary for health.","Without freedom there can be no morality.","If I accept the fact that a god is absolute and beyond all human experiences, he leaves me cold. I do not affect him, nor does he affect me. But if I know that a god is a powerful impulse in my soul, at once I must concern myself with him, for then he can become important","Synchronicity reveals the meaningful connections between the subjective and objective world.","I am an orphan, alone: nevertheless I am found everywhere. I am one, but opposed to myself. I am youth and old man at one and the same time. I have known neither father nor mother, because I have had to be fetched out of the deep like a fish, or fell like a white stone from heaven. In woods and mountains I roam, but I am hidden in the innermost soul of man. I am mortal for everyone, yet I am not touched by the cycle of aeons.","Find out what a person fears most and that is where he will develop next.","The more uncertain I have felt about myself, the more there has grown up in me a feeling of kinship with all things.","Learn your theories as well as you can, but put them aside when you touch the miracle of the living soul","Meaninglessnes s inhibits fullness of life and is therefore the equivalent to illness. Meaning makes a great many things endurable--perh aps everything.","Identification with one\'s office or title is very attractive indeed, which is precisely why so many men are nothing more than the decorum accorded to them by society. In vain would one look for a personality behind the husk. Underneath one would find a very pitiable little creature. That is why the office is so attractive: it offers easy compensation for personal deficiencies.","Even a happy life cannot be without a measure of darkness.","There is no birth of consciousness without pain.","Free will is the ability to do gladly that which I must do.","The spirit is the life of the body seen from within, and the body the outward manifestation of the life of the spirit-the two being really one.","I would rather be whole than good.","Man\'s unconscious... contains all the patterns of life and behaviour inherited from his ancestors, so that every human child, prior to consciousness, is possessed of a potential system of adapted psychic functioning.","The creative mind plays with the object it loves.","The psychic depths are nature, and nature is creative life.","Resistance to the organized mass can be effected only by the man who is as well organized in his individuality as the mass itself.","The dream is a series of images, which are apparently contradictory and nonsensical, but arise in reality from psychologic material which yields a clear meaning.","The separation of psychology from the premises of biology is purely artificial, because the human psyche lives in indissoluble union with the body.","The unconscious is not just evil by nature, it is also the source of the highest good: not only dark but also light, not only bestial, semihuman, and demonic but superhuman, spiritual, and, in the classical sense of the word, \\"divine.\\"","Every father is given the opportunity to corrupt his daughter\'s nature, and the educator, husband, or psychiatrist then has to face the music. For what has been spoiled by the father can only be made good by a father, just as what has been spoiled by the mother can only be repaired by a mother. The disastrous repetition of the family pattern could be described as the psychological original sin, or as the curse of the Atrides running through the generations.","I saw that everything, all paths I had been following, all steps I had taken, were leading back to a single point - namely, to the mid-point. It became increasingly plain to me that the mandala is the center. It is the exponent of all paths. It is the path to the center, to individuation. I knew that in finding the mandala as an expression of the self I had attained what was for me the ultimate.","Intuition does not denote something contrary to reason, but something outside of the province of reason.","Faith, hope, love, and insight are the highest achievements of human effort. They are found-given-by experience.","But we must not forget that only a very few people are artists in life; that the art of life is the most distinguished and rarest of all the arts.","Life has always seemed to me like a plant that lives on its rhizome. Its true life is invisible, hidden in the rhizome. The part that appears above ground lasts only a single summer. Then it withers away\u2014an ephemeral apparition. When we think of the unending growth and decay of life and civilizations, we cannot escape the impression of absolute nullity. Yet I have never lost a sense of something that lives and endures underneath the eternal flux. What we see is the blossom, which passes. The rhizome remains.","In the history of the collective as in the history of the individual, everything depends on the development of consciousness.","Every man carries within himself the eternal image of woman, not the image of this or that particular woman, but a definite feminine image. This image is fundamentally unconscious, a hereditary factor of primordial origin.","Great talents are the most lovely and often the most dangerous fruits on the tree of humanity. They hang upon the most slender twigs that are easily snapped off.","The main interest of my work is not concerned with the treatment of neuroses but rather with the approach to the numinous. But the fact that the approach to the numinous is the real therapy, and inasmuch as you attain to the numinous experience you are released from the curse of pathology. Even the very disease takes on a numinous character.","...The unconscious has no time. There is no trouble about time in the unconscious. Part of our psyche is not in time and not in space. They are only an illusion, time and space, and so in a certain part of our psyche time does not exist at all.","This whole creation is essentially subjective, and the dream is the theater where the dreamer is at once: scene, actor, prompter, stage manager, author, audience, and critic.","The prerequisite for a good marriage ... is the license to be unfaithful.","My own understanding is the sole treasure I possess, and the greatest. Though infinitely small and fragile in comparison with the powers of darkness, it is still a light, my only light.","Enchantment is the oldest form of medicine.","Mind and matter are two different aspects of one and the same thing.","Knowledge does not enrich us; it removes us more and more from the mythic world in which we were once at home by right of birth.","I don\'t aspire to be a good man. I aspire to be a whole man.","Man\'s task is to become conscious of the contents that press upward from the unconscious.","Dreams are impartial, spontaneous products of the unconscious psyche, outside the control of the will. They are pure nature; they show us the unvarnished, natural truth, and are therefore fitted, as nothing else is, to give us back an attitude that accords with our basic human nature when our consciousness has strayed too far from its foundations and run into an impasse.","At the moment I am looking into astrology, which seems indispensable for a proper understanding of mythology. There are strange and wondrous things in these lands of darkness. Please, don\'t worry about my wanderings in these infinitudes. I shall return laden with rich booty for our knowledge of the human psyche.","If you want to understand the jungle, you can\'t be content just to sail back and forth near the shore. You\'ve got to get into it, no matter how strange and frightening it might seem.","Explore daily the will of God.","When an inner situation is not made conscious, it appears outside as fate.","Nobody, as long as he moves about among the chaotic currents of life, is without trouble.","The decisive question for man is: Is he related to something infinite or not? That is the telling question of his life. Only if we know that the thing which truly matters is the infinite can we avoid fixing our interest upon futilities, and upon all kinds of goals which are not of real importance.","Sometimes, indeed, there is such a discrepancy between the genius and his human qualities that one has to ask oneself whether a little less talent might not have been better.","Our whole educational problem suffers from a one-sided approach to the child who is to be educated, and from an equally one-sided lack of emphasis on the uneducatedness of the educator.","Meaning makes a great many things endurable---per haps everything.","Instead of being at the mercy of wild beasts, earthquakes, landslides, and inundations, modern man is battered by the elemental forces of his own psyche. This is the World Power that vastly exceeds all other powers on earth. The Age of Enlightenment, which stripped nature and human institutions of gods, overlooked the God of Terror who dwells in the human soul.","Naturally, every age thinks that all ages before it were prejudiced, and today we think this more than ever and are just as wrong as all previous ages that thought so. How often have we not seen the truth condemned! It is sad but unfortunately true that man learns nothing from history.","Intuition (is) perception via the unconscious","Often the hands will solve a mystery that the intellect has struggled with in vain.","The unconscious is not a demoniacal monster, but a natural entity which, as far as moral sense, aesthetic taste, and intellectual judgment go, is completely neutral.It only becomes dangerous when our conscious attitude to it is hopelessly wrong. To the degree that we repress it, its danger increases.","Without consciousness there would, practically speaking, be no world, for the world exists as such only in so far as it is consciously reflected and considered by a psyche. Consciousness is a precondition of being.","Every psychic advance of man arises from the suffering of the soul.","If only simplicity were not the most difficult of all things. It consists of watching objectively the development of any fragment of fantasy.","Follow that will and that way which experience confirms to be your own.","Conflicts create the fire of affects and emotions; and like every fire it has two aspects: that of burning and that of giving light.","Solitude is for me a fount of healing which makes my life worth living.","There can be no transforming of darkness into light and of apathy into movement without emotion.","Our souls as well as our bodies are composed of individual elements which were all already present in the ranks of our ancestors. The \\"newness\\" in the individual psyche is an endlessly varied recombination of age-old components.","Perhaps this sounds very simple, but simple things are always the most difficult. In actual life it requires the greatest discipline to be simple, and the acceptance of oneself is the essence of the moral problem and the epitome of a whole outlook upon life.","If one does not understand a person, one tends to regard him as a fool.","The greater the tension, the greater is the potential.","The longing for light is the longing for consciousness.","The woman is increasingly aware that love alone can give her full stature, just as the man begins to discern that spirit alone can endow his life with its highest meaning. Fundamentally, therefore, both seek a psychic relation to the other, because love needs the spirit, and the spirit love, for their fulfillment.","When we must deal with problems, we instinctively resist trying the way that leads through obscurity and darkness. We wish to hear only of unequivocal results, and completely forget that these results can only be brought about when we have ventured into and emerged again from the darkness. But to penetrate the darkness we must summon all the powers of enlightenment that consciousness can offer.","The attainment of wholeness requires one to stake one\'s whole being. Nothing less will do; there can be no easier conditions, no substitutes, no compromises.","The healthy man does not torture others.","Nature is not matter only. She is also a spirit","There is no coming to consciousness without pain. People will do anything, no matter how absurd, in order to avoid facing their own Soul. One does not become enlightened by imagining figures of light, but by making the darkness conscious.","Science is the art of creating suitable illusions which the fool believes or argues against, but the wise man enjoys for their beauty or their ingenuity, without being blind to the fact that they are human veils and curtains concealing the abysmal darkness of the unknowable","The problem of synchronicity has puzzled me for a long time, ever since the middle twenties, when I was investigating the phenomena of the collective unconscious and kept on coming across connections which I simply could not explain as chance groupings or \\"runs.\\"  What I found were \\"coincidences\\" which were connected so meaningfully that their \\"chance\\" concurrence would represent a degree of improbability that would have to be expressed by an astronomical figure.","Nature seemed to me full of wonders, and I wanted to steep myself in them. Every stone, every plant, every single thing seemed alive and indescribably marvelous. I immersed myself in nature, crawled, as it were, into the very essence of nature and away from the whole human world.","The only important thing is to follow nature. A tiger should be a good tiger; a tree, a good tree. So people should be people. But to know what people are, one must follow nature and go alone, admitting the importance of the unexpected. Still, nothing is possible without love. . . . For love puts one in a mood to risk everything, and not to withhold important elements.","The biographies of great artists make it abundantly clear that the creative urge is often so imperious that it battens on their humanity and yokes everything to the service of the work, even at the cost of health and ordinary human happiness. The unborn work in the psyche of the artist is a force of nature that achieves its end either with tyrannical might or with the subtle cunning of nature herself, quite regardless of the personal fate of the man who is its vehicle.","I studiously avoided all so-called \\"holy men.\\" I did so because I had to make do with my own truth, not accept from others what I could not attain on my own. I would have felt it as a theft had I attempted to learn from the holy men and to accept their truth for myself. Neither in Europe can I make any borrowings from the East, but must shape my life out of myself-out of what my inner being tells me, or what nature brings to me.","Everyone is in love with his own ideas","There is a deep need in the world just now for guidance - almost any sort of spiritual guidance.","The world of gods and spirits is truly \'nothing but\' the collective unconscious inside me.","The greatest and most important problems of life are all in a certain sense insoluble. They can never be solved, but only outgrown. This \'outgrowing\', as I formerly called it, on further experience was seen to consist in a new level of consciousness. Some higher or wider interest arose on the person\'s horizon, and through this widening of view, the insoluble problem lost its urgency. It was not solved logically in its own terms, but faded out when confronted with a new and stronger life-tendency.","Everyone carries a shadow, and the less it is embodied in the individual\'s conscious life, the blacker and denser it is. At all counts, it forms an unconscious snag, thwarting our most well-meant intentions.","Be simple and always take the next step. You needn\'t see it in advance, but you can look back at it afterwards.There is no \'how\' of life, one just does it.","Our unconscious is the key to our life\'s pursuits.","The unconscious mind of man sees correctly even when conscious reason is blind and impotent.","The pendulum of the mind alternates between sense and nonsense, not between right and wrong.","We have forgotten the age-old fact that God speaks chiefly through dreams and visions.","The unconscious wants to flow into consciousness in order to reach the light, but at the same time it continually thwarts itself, because it would rather remain unconscious. That is to say, God wants to become man, but not quite.","The Shadow is a moral problem that challenges the whole ego-personality, for no one can become conscious of the shadow without considerable moral effort. To become conscious of it involves recognizing the dark aspects of the personality as present and real. This act is the essential condition for any kind of self-knowledge, and it therefore, as a rule, meets with considerable resistance. Indeed, self-knowledge as a psychotherapuetic measure frequently requires much painstaking work extending over a long period of time.","People cannot stand too much Reality.","The starry vault of heaven is in truth the open book of cosmic projection.","Neurosis is an inner cleavage-the state of being at war with oneself.","We are living in what the Greeks called the kairos - the right moment - for a \'metamorphosis of the gods\', of the fundamental principles and symbols. This peculiarity of our time, which is certainly not of our conscious choosing, is the expression of the unconscious man within us who is changing.","Learn your techniques well and be prepared to let them go when you touch the human soul.","Dreams are the guiding words of the Soul.","You can exert no influence if you are not susceptible to influence.","Nobody can fall so low unless he has a great depth. If such a thing can happen to a man, it challenges his best and highest on the other side; that is to say, this depth corresponds to a potential height, and the blackest darkness to a hidden light.","A special ability means a heavy expenditure of energy in a particular direction, with a consequent drain from some other side of life.","As a plant produces its flower, so the psyche creates its symbols.","Summoned or not, the god will come.","The great problems of life \u2014 sexuality, of course, among others \u2014 are always related to the primordial images of the collective unconscious. These images are really balancing or compensating factors which correspond with the problems life presents in actuality. This is not to be marveled at, since these images are deposits representing the accumulated experience of thousands of years of struggle for adaptation and existence.","What we lack is intensity of life.","Everything psychic is pregnant with the future.","Called or not, God is always there.","Active imagination requires a state of reverie, half-way between sleep and waking.","A creative person has little power over his own life. He is not free. He is captive and driven by his daimon.","No psychic value can disappear without being replaced by another of equivalent intensity.","Individuation is to divest the self of false wrappings.","There is no such thing as a pure extrovert or a pure introvert. Such a man would be in the lunatic asylum.","Deeply listening to music opens up new avenues of research I\'d never even dreamed of. I feel from now on music should be an essential part of every analysis.","The images of the unconscious place a great responsibility upon a man. Failure to understand them, or a shirking of ethical responsibility, deprives him of his wholeness and imposes a painful fragmentariness on his life.","Part of the human Self or Soul is not subject to laws of space and time.","Projection [of our own shadow] makes the whole world a replica of our own unknown face.","Nothing is possible without love.","I don\'t believe there is a God. I know there is a God.","Every individual needs revolution, inner division, overthrow of the existing order, and renewal, but not by forcing them upon his neighbors under the hypocritical cloak of Christian love or the sense of social responsibility or any of the other beautiful euphemisms for unconscious urges to personal power.","The totality of the psyche can never be grasped by the intellect alone.","Securities, certitudes and peace do not lead to discoveries.","Neurosis is always a substitute for legitimate suffering.","The highest, most decisive experience is to be alone with one\'s own self. You must be alone to find out what supports you, when you find that you can not support yourself. Only this experience can give you an indestructible foundation.","It is only through the psyche that we can establish that God acts upon us, but we are unable to distinguish whether these actions emanate from God or from the unconscious. We cannot tell whether God and the unconscious are two different entities. Both are border-line concepts for transcendental contents. But empirically it can be established, with a sufficient degree of probability, that there is in the unconscious an archetype of wholeness.","Too much of the animal disfigures the civilized human being, too much culture makes a sick animal.","In actual life it requires the greatest discipline to be simple, and the acceptance of oneself is the essence of the moral problem and the epitome of a whole outlook upon life.","How can anyone see straight when he does not see himself and the darkness he unconsciously carries with him into all his dealings?","We are born at a given moment, in a given place and, like vintage years of wine, we have the qualities of the year and of the season of which we are born. Astrology does not lay claim to anything more.","All the most powerful ideas in history go back to archetypes.","Creative power is mightier than its possessor.","At present we educate people only up to the point where they can earn a living and marry; then education ceases altogether, as though a complete mental outfit had been acquired. ... Vast numbers of men and women thus spend their entire lives in complete ignorance of the most important things.","Just imagine what would happen if practicing physicians, the ones who have come into contact directly with suffering humanity, had some acquaintance with Eastern systems of healing. The Spirit of the East surges through every pore as a balm for all afflictions.","The term \\"self\\" seems a suitable one for the unconscious substrate whose actual exponent in consciousness is the ego. The ego stands to the self as the moved to the mover, or as object to subject, because the determining factors that radiate outward from the self surround the ego on all sides and are therefore supraordinate to it. The self, like the unconscious, as an a priori existent out of which the ego evolves. It is, so to speak, an unconscious prefiguration of the ego. It is not I who create myself; rather, I happen to myself.","There is no light without shadow, and no psychic wholeness without  imperfection.","The debt we owe to the play of imagination is incalculable.","The maintenance of secrets acts like a psychic poison which alienates the possessor from the community.","There is a thinking in primordial images, in symbols which are older than the historical man, which are inborn in him from the earliest times, eternally living, outlasting all generations, still make up the groundwork of the human psyche. It is only possible to live the fullest life when we are in harmony with these symbols; wisdom is a return to them.","Synchronistic phenomena prove the simultaneous occurrence of meaningful equivalences in heterogenous, causally unrelated processes; in other words, they prove that a content perceived by an observer can, at the same time, be represented by an outside event, without any causal connection. From this it follows either that the psyche cannot be localized in time, or that space is relative to the psyche.","Everything good is costly, and the development of personality is one of the most costly of all things.  It is a matter of saying yes to oneself, of taking oneself as the most serious of tasks, of being conscious of everything one does, and keeping it constantly before one\'s eyes in all its dubious aspects.","Like the sea itself, the unconscious yields an endless and self-replenishing abundance of creatures, a wealth beyond our fathoming.","The greatest potential for growth and self-realisation exists in the second half of life.","The underlying, primary psychic reality is so inconceivably complex that it can be grasped only at the farthest reach of intuition, and then but very dimly. That is why it needs symbols.","If there is a fear of falling, the only safety consists in deliberately jumping.","Thunder is no longer the voice of an angry god... No river contains a spirit... no snake the embodiment of wisdom, no mountain cave the home of a great demon. No voices now speak to man from stones, plants and animals, nor does he speak to them thinking they can hear. His contact with nature has gone, and with it has gone the profound emotional energy that this symbolic connection supplied.","I believe that we have no real access to who we really are except in God. Only when we rest in God can we find the safety, the spaciousness, and the scary freedom to be who we are, all that we are, more than we are, and less than we are.","Our blight is ide\xadolo\xadgies \u2014 they are the long-expected Antichrist!","The dream arises from a part of the mind unknown to us, but none the less important, and is concerned with the desires for the approaching day.","We want to have certainties and no doubts- results and no experiments- without even seeing that certainties can arise only through doubt and results only thorough experiment.","Healing proceeds from the depths to the heights.","What happens in the life of Christ happens always and everywhere. In the Christian archetype all lives of this kind are prefigured.","Myth is more individual and expresses life more precisely than does science.","The educated man tries to repress the inferior one in himself, without realizing that by this he forces the latter to become revolutionary.","The growth of the mind is the widening of the range of consciousness, and each step forward has been a most painful and laborious achievement.","Here and there it happened in my practice that a patient grew beyond himself because of unknown potentialities, and this became an experience of prime importance to me. I had learned in the meanwhile that the greatest and most important problems of life are all in a certain sense insoluble. They must be so because they express the necessary polarity inherent in every self-regulating system. They can never be solved, but only outgrown.","Someone who is brave enough to withdraw all his projections, [is] an individual who is conscious of a pretty thick shadow.","The judgment of the intellect is, at best, only the half of truth.","Whenever justice is uncertain and police spying and terror are at work, human beings fall into isolation, which, of course, is the aim and purpose of the dictator state, since it is based on the greatest possible accumulation of depotentiated social units.","We need more understanding of human nature, because the only real danger that exists is man himself.","Even the enlightened person remains what he is, and is never more than his own limited ego before the One who dwells within him, whose form has no knowable boundaries, who encompasses him on all sides, fathomless as the abysms of the earth and vast as the sky","Water is the commonest symbol for the unconscious.","The individual disposition is already a factor in childhood; it is innate, and not acquired in the course of a life.","The little world of childhood with its familiar surroundings is a model of the greater world. The more intensively the family has stamped its character upon the child, the more it will tend to feel and see its earlier miniature world again in the bigger world of adult life. Naturally this is not a conscious, intellectual process.","Dawn is born at midnight.","One of the main functions of formalized religion is to protect people against a direct experience of God.","The only thing that really matters now is whether man can climb up to a higher moral level, to a higher plane of consciousness, in order to be equal to the superhuman powers which the fallen angels have played into his hands. But he can make no progress until he becomes very much better acquainted with his own nature.","The great decisions of human life have as a rule far more to do with the instincts and other mysterious unconscious factors than with conscious will and well-meaning reasonableness. The shoe that fits one person pinches another; there is no recipe for living that suits all cases. Each of us carries his own life-form- an indeterminable form which cannot be superseded by any other.","What is not brought to consciousness, comes to us as fate.","What usually has the strongest psychic effect on the child is the life which the parents have not lived","I find that all my thoughts circle around God like the planets around the sun, and are as irresistibly attracted by Him. I would feel it to be the grossest sin if I were to oppose any resistance to this force.","As soon as the dialogue between two people touches on something fundamental, essential, numinous, and a certain rapport is felt, it gives rise to a phenomenon which L\xe9vy-Bruhl fittingly called participation mystique. It is an unconscious identity in which two individual psychic spheres interpenetrate to such a degree that it is impossible to say what belongs to whom.","The collective unconscious contains the whole spiritual heritage of mankind\'s evolution born anew in the brain structure of every individual.","I can only gaze with wonder and awe at the depths of and heights of our psychic nature. Its non-spatial universe conceals an untold abundance of images which have accumulated over millions of years of living development and become fixed in the organism....Beside this picture I would like to place the spectacle of the starry heavens at night, for the only equivalent of the universe within is the universe without; and just as I reach this world through the medium of the body, so I reach that world through the medium of the psyche.","We are a psychic process which we do not control, or only partly direct. Consequently, we cannot have any final judgment about ourselves or our lives.","To confront a person with their own shadow is to show them their own light.","Through pride we are ever deceiving ourselves. But deep down below the surface of the average conscience a still, small voice says to us, something is out of tune.","A criminal becomes a popular figure because he unburdens in no small degree the consciences of his fellow man, for now they know once more where evil is to be found.","I know that in many things I am not like others, but I do not know what I really am like. Man cannot compare himself with any other creature; he is not a monkey, not a cow, not a tree. I am a man. But what is it to be that? Like every other being, I am a splinter of the infinite deity, but I cannot contrast myself with any animal, any plant or any stone. Only a mythical being has a range greater than man\'s. How then can man form any definite opinions about himself?.","It is just man\'s turning away from instinct--his opposing himself to instinct--that creates consciousness. Instinct is nature andseeks to perpetuate nature; while consciousness can only seek culture or its denial.","We should know what our convictions are, and stand for them. Upon one\'s own philosophy, conscious or unconscious, depends one\'s ultimate interpretation of facts. Therefore it is wise to be as clear as possible about one\'s subjective principles. As the man is, so will be his ultimate truth.","Who has fully realized that history is not contained in thick books but lives in our very blood?","An understanding heart is everything in a teacher, and cannot be esteemed highly enough.","The more intelligent and cultured a man is, the more subtly he can humbug himself.","The years... when I pursued the inner images were the most important time of my life. Everything else is to be derived from this. It began at that time, and the later details hardly matter anymore. My entire life consisted in elaborating what had burst forth from the unconscious and flooded me like an enigmatic stream and threatened to break me. That was the stuff and material for more than only one life. Everything later was merely the outer classification, the scientific elaboration, and the integration into life. But the numinous beginning, which contained everything was then.","The difference between the \\"natural\\" individuation process, which runs its course unconsciously, and the one that is consciously realized is tremendous. In the first case, consciousness nowhere intervenes; the end remains as dark as the beginning. In the second case, so much darkness comes to light that the personality is permeated with light and consciousness necessarily gains in scope and insight. The encounter between conscious and unconscious has to ensure that the light that shines in the darkness is not only comprehended by the darkness, but comprehends it.","Continuous creation is to be thought of not only as a series of successive acts of creation, but also as the eternal presence of the one creative act.","The doctor is effective only when he himself is affected. Only the wounded physician heals.","One might expect, perhaps, that a man full of genius could pasture in the greatness of his own thoughts, and renounce the cheap approbation of the crowd which he despises; yet he succumbs to the more powerful impulse of the herd instinct. His searching and his finding, his call, belong to the herd.","But, if you have nothing at all to create, then perhaps you create yourself.","When you walk with naked feet, how can you ever forget the Earth?","It is my mind, with its store of images, that gives the world colour and sound; and that supremely real and rational certainty which I call \\"experience\\" is, in its most simple form, an exceedingly complicated structure of mental images. Thus there is, in a certain sense, nothing that is directly experienced except the mind itself. Everything is mediated through the mind.","...The Western \'God-image\' is a representation of the collective unconscious, an archetype of the psyche that undergoes a continual process of transformation...The God image evolves through its relationship to humanity. Whoever knows God has an effect on \'him\'. For the individual, knowing God, is the process of recognizing and assimilating the pressured and paradoxical contents of the self, which come to consciousness- seek incarnation- within the ego.","Simple things are always the most difficult.","Even if the whole world were to fall to pieces, the unity of the psyche would never be shattered.","Whatever is rejected from the self, appears in the world as an event.","The utter failure came at the Crucifixion in the tragic words, \'My God, my God, why hast thou forsaken me?\' If you want to understand the full tragedy of those words you must realize what they meant: Christ saw that his whole life, devoted to the truth according to his best conviction, had been a terrible illusion. He had lived it to the full absolutely sincerely, he had made his honest experiment, but it was nevertheless a compensation. On the cross his mission deserted him. But because he had lived so fully and devotedly he won through to the Resurrection body.","The mind has grown to its present state of consciousness as an acorn grows into an oak, or as saurians developed into mammals.","Anthropologists have often described what happens to a primitive society when its spiritual values are exposed to the impact of modern civilisation. Its people lose the meaning of their lives, their social organisation disintegrates, and they themselves morally decay. We are now in the same condition. But we have never really understood what we have lost, for our spiritual leaders unfortunately were more interested in protecting their institutions than in understanding the mystery that symbols present.","The mandala is an archetypal image whose occurrence is attested throughout the ages. It signifies the wholeness of the self. This circular image represents the wholeness of the psychic ground or, to put it in mythic terms, the divinity incarnate in man.","The man who speaks with primordial images, speaks with a thousand tongues.","In thirty years I have treated many patients. Among all my patients in the second half of life, every one of them fell ill because he had lost that which the living religions of every age had given their followers, and none of them was really healed who did not regain his religious outlook.","Archetypes resemble the beds of rivers: dried up because the water has deserted them, though it may return at any time. An archetype is something like an old watercourse along which the water of life flowed for a time, digging a deep channel for itself. The longer it flowed the deeper the channel, and the more likely it is that sooner or later the water will return.","An old man who cannot bid farewell to life appears as feeble and sickly as the young man who is unable to embrace it.","It is sad but unfortunately true that man learns nothing from history.","People learn from who we are, rather than what we say, and to believe otherwise is a disease of the mind.","I do not believe...I know.","Only the wounded physician heals.","In each of us there is another whom we do not know.","Six weeks after his death my father appeared to me in a dream... It was an unforgettable experience, and it forced me for the first time to think about life after death.","The collective unconscious appears to consist of mythological motifs or primordial images, for which reason the myths of all nations are its real exponents. In fact the whole of mythology could be taken as a sort of projection of the collective unconscious. We can see this most clearly if we look at the heavenly constellations, whose originally chaotic forms are organized through the projection of images. This explains the influence of the stars as asserted by astrologers. These influences are nothing but unconscious instrospective perceptions of the collective unconscious.","I want to be freed neither from human beings, nor from myself, nor from nature; for all these appear to me the greatest of miracles.","Individualization does not shut one out from the world, but gathers the world to oneself.","God has fallen out of containment in religion and into human hearts\u2014God is incarnating. Our whole unconscious is in an uproar from the God Who wants to know and to be known.","Eternal truth needs a human language that alters with the spirit of the times.","The psyche is a natural phenomenon. All aspects of the psyche, even those which seem pathological or destructive, actually serve the function of furthering our psychological development.","Everyone can afford to give away a smile.","Music is the application of sounds to the canvas of silence.","The sight of a child\u2026will arouse certain longings in adult, civilized persons \u2014 longings which relate to the unfulfilled desires and needs of those parts of the personality which have been blotted out of the total picture in favor of the adapted persona.","The right way to wholeness is made up of fateful detours and wrong turnings.","Knowledge rests not upon truth alone, but upon error also.","Ultimate truth, if there be such a thing, demands the concert of many voices.","In fact, the whole of mythology could be taken as a sort of projection of the collective unconscious","Our heart glows, and secret unrest gnaws at the root of our being. Dealing with the unconscious has become a question of life for us.","Complexes are psychic contents which are outside the control of the conscious mind. They have been split off from consciousness and lead a separate existence in the unconscious, being at all times ready to hinder or to reinforce the conscious intentions.","The puzzling thing is that there is really a curious coincidence between astrological and psychological facts, so that one can isolate time from the characteristics of an individual, and also, one can deduce characteristics from a certain time.","The idea of suicide, understandable as it is, does not seem commendable to me. We live in order to gain the greatest possible amount of spiritual development and self-awareness. As long as life is possible, even if only in a minimal degree, you should hang onto it, in order to scoop it up for the purpose of conscious development. To interrupt life before its time is to bring to a standstill an experiment which we have not set up. We have found ourselves in the midst of it and must carry it through to the end.","The self is not only the centre but also the whole circumference which embraces both conscious and unconscious; it is the centre of this totality, just as the ego is the centre of consciousness.","For the alchemist the one primarily in need of redemption is not man, but the deity who is lost and sleeping in matter.","Magic is the science of the jungle.","No nation keeps its word. A nation is a big, blind worm, following what? Fate perhaps. A nation has no honor, it has no word to keep.","To the critical intelligence, nothing is left of absolute reality.","The general function of dreams is to try to restore our psychological balance by producing dream material that re-establishes, in a subtle way, the total psychic equilibrium.","Dreams are the facts from which we must proceed.","The meaning and design of a problem seem not to lie in its solution, but in our working at it incessantly.","There is rarely a creative man who does not have to pay a high price for the divine spark of his greatest gifts... the human element is frequently bled for the benefit of the creative element and to such an extent that it even brings out the bad qualities, as for instance, ruthless, naive egoism (so-called \\"auto-eroticism\\"), vanity, all kinds of vices-and all this in order to bring to the human I at least some life-strength, since otherwise it would perish of sheer inanition.","Science is not ... a perfect instrument, but it is a superb and invaluable tool that works harm only when taken as an end in itself.","Instinct is like Nature herself - prodigiously conservative, and yet transcending her own historical conditions in her acts of creation.","The \'squaring of the circle\' is one of the many archetypal motifs which form the basic patterns of our dreams and fantasies. But it is distinguished by the fact that it is one of the most important of them from the functional point of view. Indeed, it could even be called the archetype of wholeness.","Enlightenment consists not merely in the seeing of luminous shapes and visions, but in making the darkness visible. The latter procedure is more difficult and therefore, unpopular.","It is also possible for the unconscious or an archetype to take complete possession of a man and to determine his fate down to the smallest detail","I think it is better for all people to live on, to look forward to the next stage (after death), as if he had to spend centuries, then he lives properly... looking forward to the great adventure ahead, then he lives!","Only a few individuals succeed in throwing off mythology in a time of a certain intellectual supremacy--the mass never frees itself.","To this day God is the name by which I designate all things which cross my willful path violently and recklessly, all things which upset my subjective views, plans and intentions and change the course of my life for better or worse.","The most intense conflicts, if overcome, leave behind a sense of security and calm which is not easily disturbed, or else a brokenness that can hardly be healed. Conversely, it is just these intense conflicts and their conflagration which are needed in order to produce valuable and lasting results.","Man is the mirror God holds up to himself, the sense organ with which he apprehends his being.","As any change must begin somewhere, it is the single individual who will experience it and carry it through. The change must indeed begin with an individual; it might be any one of us. Nobody can afford to look round and to wait for somebody else to do what he is loath to do himself.","So far as the personality is still potential, it can be called transcendent, and so far as it is unconscious, it is indistinguishable from all those things that carry its projections...that is, symbols of the outside world and the cosmic symbols. These form the psychological basis for the conception of man as a macrocosm through the astrological components of his character.","What was given to us by the past is adapted to the possibilities of the future.","Language, in its origin and essence, is simply a system of signs or symbols that denote real occurrences or their echo in the human soul.","The dream is a little hidden door in the innermost and most secret recesses of the soul, opening into that cosmic night which was psyche long before there was any ego-consciousness, and which will remain psyche no matter how far our ego-consciousness extends.","The creative process, so far as we are able to follow it at all, consists in the unconscious activation of an archetypal image and elaborating and shaping the image into the finished work. By giving it shape, the artist translates it into the language of the present and so makes it possible for us to find our way back to the deepest springs of life.","There is, how\xadever, a strong empir\xadi\xadcal rea\xadson why we should cul\xadti\xadvate thoughts that can never be proved. It is that they are known to be use\xadful. Man pos\xadi\xadtively needs gen\xaderal ideas & con\xadvic\xadtions that will give a mean\xading to his life & enable him to find a place for him\xadself in the uni\xadverse. He can stand the most incred\xadi\xadble hard\xadships when he is con\xadvinced that they make sense; he is crushed when on top of all his mis\xadfor\xadtunes, he has to admit that he is tak\xading part in a \u2018tale told by an idiot.\u2019","While personal problems are not overlooked, the analyst keeps an eye on their symbolic aspects, for healing comes only from what leads the patient beyond himself and beyond his entanglement in the ego.","Rebirth is an affirmation that must be counted among the primordial affirmations of mankind. The concept of rebirth necessarily implies the continuity of personality. Here the human personality is regarded as continuous and accessible to memory, so that, when one is incarnated or born, one is able, potentially, to remember that one has lived through previous existences, and that these existences were one\'s own, ie, they had the same ego form as the present life. As a rule, reincarnation means rebirth in a human body.","My mandalas were cryptograms concerning the state of the self which was presented to me anew each day...I guarded them like precious pearls....It became increasingly plain to me that the mandala is the center. It is the exponent of all paths. It is the path to the center, to individuation.","The need for mythic statements is satisfied when we frame a view of the world which adequately explains the meaning of human existence in the cosmos, a view which springs from our psychic wholeness, from the co-operation between conscious and unconscious. Meaninglessness inhibits fullness of life and is therefore equivalent to illness. Meaning makes a great many things endurable - perhaps everything.","But what will he do when he sees only too clearly why his patient is ill; when he sees that it arises from his having no love, but only sexuality; no faith, because he is afraid to grope in the dark; no hope, because he is disillusioned by the world and by life; and no understanding, because he has failed to read the meaning of his own existence?","...it seemed to me I was living in an insane asylum of my own making. I wnt about with all these fantastic figures: centaurs, nymphs, satyrs, gods and goddesses, as though they were patients and I was analyzing them. I read a Greek or Negro myth as if a lunatic were telling me his anamnesis.","Never diagnose a (client) until after their therapy is over.","When you come to think about it, nothing has any meaning, for when there was nobody to think, there was nobody to interpret what happened.","We cannot imagine events that are connected non-causally and are capable of a non-causal explanation. But that does not mean that such events do not exist.","I use [Heraclitus\' discovery of] enantiodromia for the emergence of the unconscious opposite in the course of time. This characteristic phenomenon practically always occurs when an extreme, onesided tendency dominates conscious life; in time an equally powerful counterposition is built up, which first inhibits the conscious performance and subsequently breaks through the conscious control.","The Self then functions as a union of opposites and thus constitutes the most immediate experience of the Divine which it is psychologically possible to imagine","The less we understand of what our fathers and forefathers sought, the less we understand ourselves, and thus we help with all our might to rob the individual of his roots and his guiding instincts, so that he becomes a particle in the mass, ruled only by what Nietzsche called the spirit of gravity.","It is on the whole probably that we continually dream, but that consciousness makes such a noise that we do not hear it.","The God-image in man was not destroyed by the Fall but was only damaged and corrupted (\u201cdeformed\u201d), and can be restored through God\'s grace. The scope of the integration is suggested by the descensus ad inferos, the descent of Christ\'s soul to hell, its work of redemption embracing even the dead. The psychological equivalent of this is the integration of the collective unconscious which forms an essential part of the individuation process.","Modern man is battered by the fundamental forces of his own psyche.","I live in my deepest hell and from there I cannot fall any further.","So often among so-called \\"primitives\\" one comes across spiritual personalities who immediately inspire respect, as though they were the fully matured products of an undisturbed fate.","The creative person is overpowered, captive of and driven by a demon... They become our legendary heroes.","It is indeed time for the clergyman and the psychotherapist to join forces.","My evenings are taken up very largely with astrology. I make horoscopic calculations in order to find a clue to the core of psychological truth.","Life is something that has to be lived and not talked about.","In all earnestness I asked myself what kind of world I had stumbled into.","We live in a world which in some respects is mysterious; things can be experienced which remain inexplicable; not everything which happens can be anticipated. The unexpected and the incredible belong in this world. Only then is life whole. For me the world has from the beginning been infinite and ungraspable.","The least of things with a meaning is worth more in life than the greatest of things without it.","The unconscious is the unwritten history of mankind from time unrecorded.","Our psyche is set up in accord with the structure of the universe, and what happens in the macrocosm likewise happens in the infinitesimal and most subjective reaches of the psyche","The unconscious is the only available source of religious experience. This in certainly not to say that what we call the unconscious is identical with God or is set up in his place. It is simply the medium from which religious experience seems to flow. As to what the further cause of such experience might be, the answer to this lies beyond the range of human knowledge.","Art is a kind of innate drive that seizes a human being and makes him its instrument.","Only in our creative acts do we step forth into the light and see ourselves whole and complete.","A dream that is not understood remains a mere occurrence; understood it becomes a living experience.","All art intuitively apprehends coming changes in the collective unconsciousness.","We do not know whether Hitler is going to found a new Islam. He is already on the way; he is like Mohammad. The emotion in Germany is Islamic; warlike and Islamic. They are all drunk with wild god. That can be the historic future.","The primary cause of unhappiness in the world today is... lack of faith.","The self as the essence of individuality is unitemporal and unique; as an archetypal symbol it is a God-image and therefore universal and eternal.","Dreaming is a philogenetically older mode of thought.","In studying the history of the human mind one is impressed again and again by the fact that its growth keeps pace with a widening range of consciousness, and that each step forward is an extremely painful and laborious achievement. One could almost say that nothing is more hateful to man than to give up the smallest particle of unconsciousness. He has a profound fear of the unknown. Ask anybody who has ever tried to introduce new ideas!","A mandala is the psychological expression of the totality of the self.","No man can change himself into anything from sheer reason; he can only change into what he potentially is.","Understanding does not cure evil, but it is a definite help, inasmuch as one can cope with a comprehensible darkness.","New ideas are not only the enemies of old ones; they also appear often in an extremely unacceptable form.","The serious problems in life...are never fully solved. If ever they should appear to be so it is a sure sign that something has been lost. The meaning and purpose of a problem seem to lie not in its solution but in our working at it incessantly.","Sentimentality is a superstructure covering brutality.","With a truly tragic delusion,\u201d Carl Jung noted, \u201cthese theologians fail to see that it is not a matter of proving the existence of the light, but of blind people who do not know that their eyes could see. It is high time we realized that it is pointless to praise the light and preach it if nobody can see it. It is much more needful to teach people the art of seeing.","Therein lies the social significance of art: It is constantly at work educating the spirit of the age, conjuring up the forms in which the age is more lacking. The unsatisfied yearning of the artist reaches back to the primordial image in the unconscious, which is best fitted to compensate the inadequacy and one-sidedness of the present. The artist seizes on this image and, in raising it from deepest unconsciousness, he brings it into relation with conscious values, thereby transforming it until it can be accepted by the minds of his contemporaries according to their powers.","An archetypal content expresses itself, first and foremost, in metaphors.","Man positively needs general ideas and convictions that will give a meaning to his life and enable him to find a place for himself in the universe.","Our mind has its history, just as our body has its history. You might be just as astonished that man has an appendix, for instance. Does he know he ought to have an appendix? He is just born with it....Our unconscious mind, like our body, is a storehouse of relics and memories of the past. A study of the structure of the unconscious collective mind would reveal the same discoveries as you make in comparative anatomy. We do not need to think that there is anything mystical about it.","In the products of the unconscious we discover mandala symbols, that is, circular and quaternity figures which express wholeness, and whenever we wish to express wholeness, we employ just such figures.","The unexpected and the incredible belong in this world. Only then is life whole.","One cannot free oneself by bowing to the yoke, but by breaking it.","If we feel our way into the human secrets of the sick person, the madness also reveals its system, and we recognize in the mental illness merely an exceptional reaction to emotional problems which are not strange to us. --\\"The Content of the Psychoses","How difficult it is to reach anything approaching a moderate and relatively calm point of view in the midst of one\'s emotions.","The bigger the crowd, the more negligible the individual.","Colors express the main psychic functions of man.","The distinction between mind and body is an artificial dichotomy, a discrimination which is unquestionably based far more on the peculiarity of intellectual understanding than on the nature of things.","I know every numbskull will babble on about \\"black man,\\" \\"maneater,\\" \\"chance,\\" and \\"retrospective interpretation,\\" in order to banish something terribly inconvenient that might sully the familiar picture of childhood innocence. Ah, these good, efficient, healthy-minded people, they always remind me of those optimistic tadpoles who bask in a puddle in the sun, in the shallowest of waters, crowding together and amiably wriggling their tails, totally unaware that the next morning the puddle will have dried up and left them stranded.","In all chaos there is a cosmos, in all disorder a secret order... we are caught and entangled in aimless experience... Only when all props and crutches are broken, and no cover from the rear offers even the slightest hope of security, does it become possible for us to experience an archetype that up till then had lain hidden behind the meaningful nonsense played out by the anima. This is the archetype of meaning, just as the anima is the archetype of life itself.","It is often tragic to see how blatantly a man bungles his own life and the lives of others yet remains totally incapable of seeing how much the whole tragedy originates in himself, and how he continually feeds it and keeps it going.","Nature has no use for the plea that one \'did not know\'.","I have no theory about dreams. I do not know how dreams arise. On the other hand, I know that if we meditate on a dream sufficiently long and thoroughly \u2013 if we take the boat with us and turn it over and over \u2013 something almost always comes out of it.","Nothing is more repulsive than a furtively prurient spirituality; it is just as unsavoury as gross sensuality.","The angel personifies something new arising from the deep unconscious.","The inner man has access to the sense organs of god.","Fidelity to the law of your own being is an act of high courage flung in the face of life.","Criticism can be effective when there is something that must be destroyed or dissolved, but it is capable only of harm when there is something to be built.","It isn\'t possible to kill part of your \u201cself\u201d unless you kill yourself first. If you ruin your conscious personality, the so-called ego-personality, you deprive the self of its real goal, namely to become real itself. The goal of life is the realization of the self. If you kill yourself you abolish that will of the self to become real, but it may arrest your personal development inasmuch it is not explained. You ought to realise that suicide is murder, since after suicide there remains a corpse exactly as with any ordinary murder. Only it is yourself that has been killed.","Once upon a time men were possessed by devils. Now they are not less obsessed by ideas","Self-reflection, or - what comes to the same thing - the urge to individuation, gathers together what is scattered and multifarious and exalts it to the original of the One, the Primordial Man. In this way our existence as separate beings, our former ego nature, is abolished, the circle of consciousness is widened, and because the paradoxes have been made conscious, the sources of conflict are dried up.","Not only does the psyche exist, but it is existence itself. It is an almost absurd prejudice to suppose that existence can only be physical...We might well say, on the contrary, that physical existence is a mere inference, since we know of matter only in so far as we perceive psychic images mediated by the senses.","A true symbol appears only when there is a need to express what thought cannot think or what is only divined or felt.","That which we do not bring to consciousness appears in our lives as fate.","Psychological type is nothing static - it changes in the course of life.","When an individual does not become conscious of their inner contradictions, the world acts out the conflict and is torn in opposite halves.","Those who look outside, dream. Those who look inside, awaken.","Thank God I\'m not a Jungian.","A man who has not passed through the inferno of his passions has never overcome them. As far as we can discern, the sole purpose of human existence is to kindle a light in the darkness of mere being. Everything that irritates us about others can lead us to an understanding of ourselves.","There are two reasons why man loses contact with the regulating center of his soul. One of them is that some single instinctive drive or emotional image can carry him into a one-sidedness that makes him lose his balance...his one-sidedness and consequent loss of balance are much dreaded by primitives, who call it \'loss of soul.\' Another threat...circles around particular complexes","Without playing with fantasy, no creative work has yet come into being.","A particularly beautiful woman is a source of terror. As a rule, a beautiful woman is a terrible disappointment.","Synchronistic events provide an immediate religious experience as a direct encounter with the compensatory patterning of events in nature as a whole, both inwardly and outwardly.","In knowing ourselves to be unique, we possess the capacity for becoming conscious of the infinite. But only then!","In some way or other we are part of a single, all-embracing psyche, a single \'greatest man. . . .\'","We are so full of apprehensions, fears, that we don\'t know exactly to what it points... a great change of our psychoglocal attitude is imminent, that is certain...because we need more understanding of human nature because ...the only real danger that exists is man himself... and we know nothing of man - his psyche should be studied because we are the origin of all coming evil.","I readily admit that I have such a great respect for what happens in the human soul that I would be afraid of disturbing and distorting the silent operation of nature by clumsy interference.","In the second half of life the necessity is imposed of recognizing no longer the validity of our former ideals but of their contraries. Of perceiving the error in what was previously our conviction, of sensing the untruth in what was our truth, and of weighing the degree of opposition, and even of hostility, in what we took to be love.","The Wrong we have Done, Thought, or Intended Will wreak its Vengeance on Our SOULS.","Had I left those images hidden in the emotions, I might have been torn to pieces by them.","Caution has its place, no doubt, but we cannot refuse our support to a serious venture which challenges the whole of the personality. If we oppose it, we are trying to suppress what is best in man - his daring and his aspirations. And should we succeed, we should only have stood in the way of that invaluable experience which might have given a meaning to life.","I am this bundle of what has been, and what has been accomplished.","It is proverbial, of course, that man never learns from history, and, as a rule, in respect to a problem of the present, it can teach us simply nothing. The new must be made through untrodden regions, without suppositions, and often, unfortunately, without piety also.","The word \'happiness\' would lose its meaning if it were not balanced and contrasted and compared to sadness. In comparing how an experience could have been worse we develop gratitude and happiness, while if we compare it how it could have been better we develop bitterness and sadness.","The self is defined psychologically as the psychic totality of the individual. Anything that a [person] postulates as being a greater totality than [oneself] can become a symbol of the self. For this reason the symbol of the self is not always as total as the definition would require.","So they speak soothingly about progress and the greatest possible happiness, forgetting that happiness is itself poisoned if the measure of suffering has not been fulfilled.","Error is just as important a condition of life\'s progress as truth","Science has destroyed even the refuge of the inner life. What was once a sheltering haven has become a place of terror","The angels are a strange genus: they are precisely what they are and cannot be anything else. They are in themselves soulless beings who represent nothing but the thoughts and intuitions of their Lord.","The greatest tragedy of the family is the unlived lives of the parents.","Just as man as a social being, cannot in the long run exist without a tie to the community, so the individual will never find the real justification for his existence, and his own spiritual and moral autonomy, anywhere except in an extramundane principle capable of relativizing the overpowering influence of external factors.","The cinema, like the detective story, makes it possible to experience without danger all the excitement, passion and desirousness which must be repressed in a humanitarian ordering of life.","Astrology is assured of recognition from psychology, without further restrictions, because astrology represents the summation of all the psychological knowledge of antiquity.","Astrology is knocking at the gates of our universities: A T\xfcbingen professor has switched over to astrology and a course on astrology was given at Cardiff University last year. Astrology is not mere superstition but contains some psychological facts (like theosophy) which are of considerable importance. Astrology has actually nothing to do with the stars but is the 5000-year-old psychology of antiquity and the Middle Ages.","I think there will be a reaction - a reaction will set in against this communal dissociation. You know, man doesn\'t stand forever, his nullification. Once, there will be a reaction, and I see it setting in, you know, when I think of my patients, they all seek their own existence and to assure their existence against that complete atomization into nothingness or into meaninglessness. Man cannot stand a meaningless life.","No one can flatter himself that he is immune to the spirit of his own epoch, or even that he possesses a full understanding of it. Irrespective of our conscious convictions, each one of us, without exception, being a particle of the general mass, is somewhere attached to, colored by, or even undermined by the spirit which goes through the mass. Freedom stretches only as far as the limits of our consciousness.","Fortunately, in her kindness and patience, Nature has never put the fatal question as to the meaning of their lives into the mouths of most people. And where no one asks, no one needs to answer.","The principle aim of psychotherapy is not to transport one to an impossible state of happiness, but to help (the client) acquire steadfastness and patience in the face of suffering.","The self is our life\'s goal, for it is the completest expression of that fateful combination we call individuality.","At times I feel as if I am spread out over the landscape and inside things, and am myself living in every tree, in the plashing of the waves, in the clouds and the animals that come and go, in the procession of the seasons.","We must be able to let things happen in the psyche. For us, this becomes a real art... Consciousness is forever interfering, helping, correcting, and negating, never leaving the single growth of the psychic processes in peace.","Many who know something but not enough about dreams and their meaning...are liable to succumb to the prejudice that the dream actually has a moral purpose, that it warns, rebukes, comforts, foretells the future, etc. If one believes that the unconscious always knows best, one can easily be betrayed into leaving the dreams to take the necessary decisions, and is then disappointed when the dreams become more and more trivial and meaningless...The unconscious functions satisfactorily only when the conscious mind fufills its task to the very limit.","A collection of a hundred great brains makes one big fathead.","Whatever is not conscious will be experienced as fate.","Whoever is afraid must needs be dependent; a weak thing needs support. That is why the primitive mind, from deep psychological necessity, begot religious instruction and embodied it in a magician or a priest.","Deep down, below the surface of the average man\'s conscience, he hears a voice whispering, \\"There is something not right,\\" no matter how much his rightness is supported by public opinion or moral code.","Liverpool is the pool of life, it makes to live.","The darkness which clings to every personality is the door into the unconscious and the gateway of dreams, from which those two twilight figures, the shadow and the anima, step into our nightly visions or, remaining invisible, take possession of our ego-consciousness.","The shadow is a moral problem that challenges the whole ego-personality, for no one can become conscious of the shadow without considerable moral effort.","I believe that history is capable of anything. There exists no folly that men have not tried out.","But the meaning of life is not . . . explained by one\'s business life, nor is the deep desire of the human heart answered by a bank account.","From the middle of life onward, only he remains vitally alive who is ready to die with life.","Where do we live symbolically? Nowhere except where we participate in the ritual of life.","Nights through dreams tell the myths forgotten by the day.","Every human being is inherently a unique and individual form of life.  He or she is made like that.  But there is something which a person can do over and above the given material of her nature, and that is she can become conscious of what makes her the person she is, and he can work consciously toward relating what is himself to the world around him.","We can hardly escape the feeling that the unconscious process moves spiral-wise round a centre, gradually getting closer, while the characteristics of the centre grow more and more distinct.","Since psyche and matter are contained in one and the same world, and moreover are in continuous contact with one another and ultimately rest on irrepresentable, transcendental factors, it is not only possible but fairly probable, even, that psyche and matter are two different aspects of the same thing.","Life is teleology par excellence; it is the intrinsic striving towards a goal, and the living organism is a system of directed aims which seek to fulfill themselves.","The apparently unendurable conflict is proof of the rightness of your life. A life without contradiction is only half a life; or else a life in the Beyond, which is destined only for angels. But God loves human beings more than the angels.","Envy does not allow humanity to sleep.","The mass State has no intention of promoting mutual understanding and the relationship of man to man; it strives, rather, for atomization, for the psychic isolation of the individual. The more unrelated individuals are, the more consolidated the State becomes, and vice versa.","Far from being a material world, this is a psychic world, which allows us to make only indirect and hypothetical inferences about the real nature of matter. The psychic, alone has immediate reality, and this includes all forms of the psychic, even","Archetypes, in spite of their conservative nature, are not static but in a continuous dramatic flux. Thus the self as a monad or continuous unit would be dead. But it lives inasmuch as it splits and unites again. There is no energy without opposites!","Aging people should know that their lives are not mounting and unfolding but that an inexorable inner process forces the contraction of life. For a young person it is almost a sin and certainly a danger to be too much occupied with himself; but for the aging person it is a duty and a necessity to give serious attention to himself.","No one should deny the danger of the descent, but it can be risked. No one need risk it, but it is certain that someone will. And let those who go down the sunset way do so with open eyes, for it is a sacrifice which daunts even the gods. Yet every descent is followed by an ascent.","Primitive superstition lies just below the surface of even the most tough-minded individuals, and it is precisely those who most fight against it who are the first to succumb to its suggestive effects.","Man is the microcosm of the macrocosm ; the God on earth is built on the pattern of the God in nature. But the universal consciousness of the real Ego transcends a million fold the self-consciousness of the personal for false ego.","When facts are few, speculations are most likely to represent individual psychology.","The seat of faith, however, is not consciousness but spontaneous religious experience, which brings the individual\'s faith into immediate relation with God.","By a symbol I do not mean an allegory or a sign, but an image that describes in the best possible way the dimly discerned nature of the spirit. A symbol does not define or explain; it points beyond itself to a meaning that is darkly divined yet still beyond our grasp, and cannot be adequately expressed in the familiar words of our language.","Protection and security are only valuable if they do not cramp life excessively.","Astrology is of particular interest to the psychologist, since it contains a sort of psychological experience which we call projected - this means that we find the psychological facts as it were in the constellations. This originally gave rise to the idea that these factors derive from the stars, whereas they are merely in a relation of synchronicity with them. I admit that this is a very curious fact which throws a peculiar light on the structure of the human mind.","Dreams are symbolic in order that they cannot be understood; in order that the wish, which is the source of the dream, may remain unknown.","I think that one should view with philosophic admiration the strange paths of the libido and should investigate the purposes of its circuitous ways.","That which compels us to create a substitute for ourselves is not the external lack of objects, but our incapacity to lovingly include a thing outside of ourselves","Every civilized human being, whatever his conscious development, is still an archaic man at the deeper levels of his psyche.","In such doubtful matters, where you have to work as a pioneer, you must be able to put some trust in your intuition and follow your feeling even at the risk of going wrong.","In my case Pilgrim\'s Progress consisted in my having to climb down a thousand ladders until I could reach out my hand to the little clod of earth that I am.","Creative powers can just as easily turn out to be destructive. It rests solely with the moral personality whether they apply themselves to good things or to bad. And if this is lacking, no teacher can supply it or take its place.","In the end, the only events of my life worth telling are those when the imperishable world erupted into this transitory one All other memories of travels, people and my surroundings have paled beside these interior happenings But my encounters with the \'other\' reality, my bouts with the unconscious, are indelibly engraved on my memory. In that realm there has always been wealth in abundance, and everything else has lost importance by comparison.","Hitler\'s movement is near to Mohammedanism.","About a third of my cases are suffering from no clinically definable neurosis, but from the senselessness and emptiness of their lives.","When a Pueblo Indian does not feel in the right mood, he stays away from the men\'s council. When an ancient Roman stumbled on the threshold as he left the house, he gave up his plans for the day. This seems to us senseless, but under primitive conditions of life such an omen inclines one at least to be cautious. When I am not in full control of myself, my bodily movements may be under a certain constraint; my attention is easily distracted; I am somewhat absent-minded. As a result I knock against something, stumble, let something fall, or forget something.","From the viewpoint of analytic psychology, the theatre, aside from any aesthetic value, may be considered as an institution for the treatment of the mass complex.","Art is a kind of innate drive that seizes a human being and makes him its instrument. To perform this difficult office it is sometimes necessary for him to sacrifice happiness and everything that makes life worth living for the ordinary human being.","One is forced to speak not of what is held in common between the cultures, but what is held in common between the myths, and that in its simplest archetypal forms.","Shrinking away from death is something unhealthy and abnormal which robs the second half of life of its purpose.","The afternoon of a human life must have a significance of its own, and cannot be merely a pitiful appendage to life\'s morning.","All neurotics seek the religious","I am astonished, disappointed, pleased with myself. I am distressed, depressed, rapturous. I am all these things at once and cannot add up the sum.","We are convinced that certain people have all the bad qualities we do not know in ourselves.","The discussion of the sexual problem is only a somewhat crude prelude to a far deeper question, and that is the question of the psychological relationship between the sexes. In comparison with this the other pales into insignificance, and with it we enter the real domain of woman. Woman\'s psychology is founded on the principle of Eros, the great binder and loosener, whereas from ancient times the ruling principle ascribed to man is Logos.","If you think along the lines of Nature then you think properly.\\" from the video \\"Carl Jung speaks about death","Creativity is the art that can give rise to visionary metaphorical relationships, as opposed to purely psy-chological ones.","It was most essential for me to have a normal life in the real world as a counterpoise to that strange inner world. My family and my profession remained the base to which I could return.","A man who has not passed through the inferno of his passions has never overcome them. They then dwell in the house next door, and at any moment a flame may dart out and set fire to his own house. Whenever we give up, leave behind, and forget too much, there is always the danger that the things we have neglected will return with added force.","The whole nature of man presupposes woman, both physically and spiritually. His system is tuned into woman from the start, just as it is prepared for a quite definite world where there is water, light, air, salt, carbohydrates etc.","I have treated many hundreds of patients. Among those in the second half of life - that is to say, over 35 - there has not been one whose problem in the last resort was not that of finding a religious outlook on life.","The word \'belief\' is a difficult thing for me. I don\'t believe. I must have a reason for a certain hypothesis. Either I know a thing, and then I know it - I don\'t need to believe it.","Even a happy life cannot be without a measure of awareness of darkness... as the contrast between what we have and how it could be worse is vital to appreciate anything, including our life, and so be happy and grateful","People are never helped in their suffering by what they think for themselves, but only by revelation of a wisdom greater than their own. It is this which lifts them out of their distress.","In sleep, fantasy takes the form of dreams. But in waking life, too, we continue to dream beneath the threshold of consciousness, especially when under the influence of repressed or other unconscious complexes.","The primordial image, or archetype, is a figure--be it a daemon, a human being, or a process--that constantly recurs in the course of history and appears wherever creative fantasy is freely expressed. Essentially, therefore, it is a mythological figure. . . . In each of these images there is a little piece of human psychology and human fate, a remnant of the joys and sorrows that have been repeated countless times in our ancestral history. . . .","The sure path can only lead to death.","Space flights are merely an escape, a fleeing away from oneself, because it is easier to go to Mars or to the moon than it is to penetrate one\'s own being.","Obviously astrology has much to offer psychology, but what the latter can offer its elder sister is less evident. So far as I judge, it would seem to me advantageous for astrology to take the existence of psychology into account, above all the psychology of the personality and of the unconscious.","We can keep from a child all knowledge of earlier myths, but we cannot take from him the need for mythology.","A residual sea of symbols which is shared by all mankind, usually accessed through dreams or altered states, and from which cultures draw images on which to found their religions.","Thoroughly unprepared, we take the step into the afternoon of life. Worse still, we take this step with the false presupposition that our truths and our ideals will serve us as hitherto. But we cannot live the afternoon of life according to the program of life\u2019s morning, for what was great in the morning will be little at evening and what in the morning was true, at evening will have become a lie.","A [wo]man who is unconscious of [her/]himself acts in a blind, instinctive way and is in addition fooled by all the illusions that arise when he sees everything that he is not conscious of in himself coming to meet him from outside as projections upon his neighbour.","Recognition of the reality of evil necessarily relativizes the good, and the evil likewise, converting both into halves of a paradoxical whole.","I have gradually learned to be cautious even in disbelief","One could say, with a little exaggeration, that the persona is that which in reality one is not, but which oneself as well as others think one is.","It will seem as if you were making the visions banal \u2014 but then you need to do that \u2014 then you are freed from the power of them Then when these things are in some precious book you can go to the book and turn over the pages and for you it will be your church \u2014 your cathedral \u2014 the silent places of your spirit where you will find renewal. If anyone tells you that it is morbid or neurotic and you listen to them \u2014 then you will lose your soul \u2014 for in that book is your soul.","However far-fetched it may sound, experience shows that many neuroses are caused by the fact that people blind themselves to their own religious promptings because of a childish passion for rational enlightenment.","Everyone knows nowadays that people \'have complexes\'. What is not so well known, though far more important theoretically, is that complexes can have us.","You can take away a man\'s gods, but only to give him others in return.","For, in order to turn the individual into a function of the State, his dependence on anything beside the State must be taken from him.","To become conscious of it involves recognizing the dark aspects of the personality as present and real.","The upheaval of our world and the upheaval of our consciousness are one and the same.","The fact is that certain ideas exist almost everywhere and at all times and can even spontaneously create themselves quite independently of migration and tradition.","The woman who fights against her father still has the possibility of leading an instinctive, feminine existence, because she rejects only what is alien to her. But when she fights against the mother she may, at the risk of injury to her instincts, attain to greater consciousness, because in repudiating the mother she repudiates all that is obscure, instinctive, ambiguous, and unconscious in her own nature.","As one grows older one must try not to work oneself to death unnecessarily. At least that\'s how it is with me... I can scarcely keep pace and must watch out that the creative forces do not chase me around the universe in a wallop.","Wherever an inferiority complex exists, there is a good reason for it.","The psychiatrist knows only too well how each of us becomes the helpless but not pitiable victim of his own sentiments. Sentimentality is the superstructure erected upon brutality.","The world hangs on a thin thread, and that is the psyche of man.","Becoming conscious is of course a sacrilege against nature; it is as though you had robbed the unconscious of something.","I am looking forward enormously to getting back to the sea again, where the overstimulated psyche can recover in the presence of that infinite peace and spaciousness.","Seldom, or perhaps never, does a marriage develop into an individual relationship smoothly and without crises; there is no coming to consciousness without pain.","For a woman, the typical danger emanating from the unconscious comes from above, from the \\"spiritual\\" sphere personified by the animus, whereas for a man it comes from the chthonic realm of the \\"world and woman,\\" i.e., the anima projected on to the world.","Life calls us forth to independence, and anyone who does not heed this call because of childish laziness or timidity is threatened with neurosis. And once this has broken out, it becomes an increasingly valid reason for running away from life.","Personality is the supreme realization of the innate idiosyncracy of a living being. It is an act of high courage flung in the face of life, the absolute affirmation of all that constitutes the individual, the most successful adaptation to the universal conditions of existence coupled with the greatest possible freedom for self-determination.","The decisive question for man is: Is he related to something infinite or not? That is the telling question of his life.","If you should see people in a room, you would not think that you had made those people, or that you were responsible for them.","Man is in need if a symbolical life- badly in need. We only live banal, ordinary, rational or irrational things- but we have no symbolic life. Where do we live symbolically? Nowhere except where we participate in the ritual of life","Special knowledge is a terrible disadvantage.","The reason for such an \u201cunreasonable\u201d attitude with me is that I am not at all sure what will happen to me after death. I have good reasons to assume that things are not finished with death. Life seems to be an interlude in a long story.","Psychiatrists classify a person as neurotic if he suffers from his problems in living, and a psychotic if he makes others suffer.","Plants were bound for good or ill to their places. They expressed not only beauty but also the thoughts of God\'s world, with an intent of their own and without deviation. Trees in particular were mysterious and seemed to me direct embodiments of the incomprehensible meaning of life. For that reason, the woods were the places where I felt closest to its deepest meaning and to its awe-inspiring workings.","Science...is part and parcel of our knowledge and obscures our insight only when it holds that the understanding given by it is the only kind there is.","When religion stops talking about animals it will be all downhill.","I know that previously I would not have dared to express myself so explicitly about so uncertain a matter. I can take this risk because I am now in my eighth decade, and the changing opinions of men scarcely impress me any more; the thoughts of the old masters are of greater value to me than the philosophical prejudices of the Western mind.","A sign is always less than the thing it points to, and a symbol is always more than we can understand at first sight. Therefore we stop at the sign but go on to the goal it indicates; but we remain with the symbol because it promises more than it reveals.","It seems to be very hard for people to live with riddles or to let them live, although one would think that life is so full of riddles as it is that a few more things we cannot answer would make no difference. But perhaps it is just this that is so unendurable, that there are irrational things in our own psyche which upset the conscious mind in its illusory certainties by confronting it with the riddle of its existence.","Astrology is one of the intuitive methods like the I Ching, geomantics, and other divinatory procedures. It is based upon the synchronicity principle,  meaningful coincidence. ... Astrology is a naively projected psychology in which the different attitudes and temperaments of man are represented as gods and identified with planets and zodiacal constellations.","The curve of life is like the parabola of a projectile which, disturbed from its initial state of rest, rises and then returns to a state of repose... Like a projectile flying to its goal, life ends in death. Even its ascent and its zenith are only steps and means to this goal... For, enlightenment or no enlightenment, consciousness or no consciousness, nature prepares itself for death.","Nobody doubts the importance of conscious experience; why then should we doubt the significance of unconscious happenings? They also are part of our life, and sometimes more truly a part of it for weal or woe than any happenings of the day.","The symbols of the self arise in the depths of the body, and they express its materiality every bit as much as the perceiving consciousness. The symbol is thus a living body","Man can try to name love, showering upon it all the names at his command, and still he will involve himself in endless self deceptions. If he possesses a grain of wisdom he will lay down his arms and name the unknown by the more unknown - ignotum per ignotius - that is by the name of God.","The Platonic world of ideas corresponds to Thinking and Sensation on the mystical level.","The upheaval of our world and the upheaval in consciousness is one and the same. Everything becomes relative and therefore doubtful. And while man, hesitant and questioning, contemplates... his spirit yearns for an answer that will allay the turmoil of doubt and uncertainty.","Life is crazy and meaningful at once.","I am no longer alone with myself, and I can only artificially recall the scary and beautiful feeling of solitude. This is the shadow side of the fortune of love.","The unsatisfied yearning of the artist reaches back to the primordial image in the unconscious which is best fitted to compensate the inadequacy and one-sidedness of the present.","Every civilized human being, whatever his conscious development, is still an archaic man at the deeper levels of his psyche. Just as the human body connects us with the mammals and displays numerous relics of earlier evolutionary stages going back to even the reptilian age, so the human psyche is likewise a product of evolution which, when followed up to its origins, show countless archaic traits.","We carry our past with us, to wit, the primitive and inferior man with his desires and emotions, and it is only with an enormous effort that we can detach ourselves from this burden. If it comes to a neurosis, we invariably have to deal with a considerably intensified shadow.","Art is a kind of innate drive that seizes a human being and makes him its instrument. The artist is not a person endowed with free will who seeks his own ends, but one who allows art to realize its purpose through him. As a human being he may have moods and a will and personal aims, but as an artist he is \\"man\\" in a higher sense\u2014 he is \\"collective man\\"\u2014 one who carries and shapes the unconscious, psychic forms of mankind.","The majority of my patients consisted not of believers but of those who had lost their faith.","His retreat into himself is not a final renunciation of the world, but a search for quietude, where alone it is possible for him to make his contribution to the life of the community.","Wo die Liebe herrscht, da gibt es keinen machtwillen, und wo die macht den vorrang hat, da fehlt die Liebe. Das eine ist der Schatten des andern.\\nTranslation: Where love rules, there is no will to power; and where power predominates, there love is lacking. The one is the shadow of the other.","Every victory contains the germ of future defeat.","What you call knowledge is an attempt to impose something comprehensible on life.","How else could it have occurred to man to divide the cosmos, on the analogy of day and night, summer and winter, into a bright day-world and a dark night-world peopled with fabulous monsters, unless he had the prototype of such a division in himself, in the polarity between the conscious and the invisible and unknowable unconscious?","Even a lie is a psychic fact.","During my medical education at the University of Basle I found vivisection horrible, barbarous and above all unnecessary","Observance of customs and laws can very easily be a cloak for a lie so subtle that our fellow human beings are unable to detect it.","All my writings may be considered tasks imposed from within, their source was a fateful compulsion. What I wrote were things that assailed me from within myself. I permitted the spirit that moved me to speak out.","Your vision will be clearer only when you manage to see within your heart.","The answer to human life is not to be found within the limits of human life.","We do not feel as if we were producing the dreams, it is rather as if the dreams came to us. They are not subject to our control but obey their own laws.","So the lion is the law-breaker. Just as to the primitive man the lion is the lawbreaker, the great nuisance, dangerous to human beings and to animals, that breaks into the Kraal at night and fetches the bull out of the herd: he is the destructive instinct.","The symbols of the self arise from the depths of the body.","A patient doesn\'t select his physical ailments. They happen to him. You could just as well ask when you are eaten by a crocodile, \'How did you select that crocodile?\'. Nonsense. He has selected you. The patient doesn\'t even select the symptoms unconsciously. That is an extraordinary exaggeration of the subject to say he was choosing such things. They get him.","It is not for us . . . to send out missionaries to foreign peoples; it is our task to build up our own Western culture.","From the living fountain of instinct flows everything that is creative; hence the unconscious is not merely conditioned by history, but is the very source of the creative impulse. It is like nature herself - prodigiously conservative, and yet transcending her own historical conditions in her acts of creation.","We are so accustomed to the apparently rational nature of our world that we can scarcely imagine anything happening that cannot be explained by common sense. The primitive man confronted by a shock of this kind would not doubt his sanity; he would think of fetishes, spirits or gods","The Christian missionary may preach the gospel to the poor naked heathen, but the spiritual heathen who populate Europe have as yet heard nothing of Christianity.","Dream the dream onward.","Unconscious assumptions or opinions are the worst enemy of woman; they can even grow into a positively demonic passion that exasperates and disgusts men, and does the woman herself the greatest injury by gradually smothering the charm and meaning of her femininity and driving it into the background. Such a development naturally ends in profound psychological disunion, in short, in a neurosis.","Because the European does not know his own unconscious, he does not understand the East and projects it into everything he fears and despises in himself.","Whereas I formerly believed it to be my bounden duty to call other persons to order, I now admit that I need calling to order myself.","My whole being was seeking for something still unknown which might confer meaning upon the banality of life.","Our mania for rational explanations obviously has its roots in our fear of metaphysics, for the two were always hostile brothers. Hence, anything unexpected that approaches us from the dark realm is regarded either as coming from outside and, therefore, as real, or else as a hallucination and, therefore, not true. The idea that anything could be real or true which does not come from outside has hardly begun to dawn on contemporary man.","Science is the tool of the Western mind and with it more doors can be opened than with bare hands.","Man and woman become a devil to each other when they do not separate their spiritual paths, for the nature of created beings is always the nature of differentiation.","It is a moral achievement on the part of the doctor who ought not to let himself be repelled by sickness and corruption.","My work as a psychoanalyst is to help patients recover their lost wholeness and to strengthen the psyche so it can resist future dismemberment.","Whether you call the principle of existence \\"God,\\" \\"matter,\\" \\"energy,\\" or anything else you like, you have created nothing; you have merely changed a symbol. Eastern and Western Thinking, 1938","The person who looks outward dreams, the person who looks inward awakens.","Every Mother contains her daughter in herself and every daughter her mother and every mother extends backwards into her mother and forwards into her daughter.","The wine of youth does not always clear with advancing years; sometimes it grows turbid.","Insight that dawns slowly seems to me to have more lasting effects than a fitful idealism, which is unlikely to hold out for long.","Moreover, my ancestors\' souls are sustained by the atmosphere of the house, since I answer for them the questions that their lives once left behind.  I carve out rough answers as best I can.  I have even drawn them on the walls.  It is as if a silent, greater family, stretching down the centuries, were peopling the house.","The starry vault of heaven is in truth the open book of cosmic projection, in which are reflected the mythologems, i.e., the archetypes. In this vision astrology and alchemy, the two classical functionaries of the psychology of the collective unconscious, join hands.","The greatest and most important problems of life are all fundamentally insoluble. They can never be solved but only outgrown.","When we assume God to be a guiding principle well, sure enough, a god is usually characteristic of a certain system of thought or morality. For instance, take the Christian God, the summum bonum: God is love, love being the highest moral principle; and God is spirit, the spirit being the supreme idea of meaning. All our Christian moral concepts derive from such assumptions, and the supreme essence of all of them is what we call God.","The facts of nature cannot in the long run be violated. Penetrating and seeping through everything like water, they will undermine any system that fails to take account of them, and sooner or later they will bring about its downfall. But an authority wise enough in its statesmanship to give sufficient free play to nature - of which spirit is a part - need fear no premature decline.","A \'scream\' is always just that - a noise and not music.","It is astounding that man, the instigator, inventor and vehicle of all these developments, the originator of all judgements and decisions and the planner of the future, must make himself such a quantit\xe9 negligeable.","St. Thomas is really a great man quite apart from his saintliness.","We should not pretend to understand the world only by the intellect; we apprehend it just as much by feeling. Therefore, the judgment of the intellect is, at best, only the half of truth, and must, if it be honest, also come to an understanding of its inadequacy.","What we do not make conscious emerges later as fate.","...consciousness can keep only a few images in full clarity at one time, and even this clarity fluctuates.","It is in applied psychology, if anywhere, that today we should be modest and grant validity to a number of apparently contradictory opinions; for we are still far from having anything like a thorough knowledge of the human psyche, that most challenging field of scientific enquiry. For the present we have merely more or less plausible opinions that defy reconciliation.","Not nature, but the \\"genius of mankind,\\" has knotted the hangman\'s noose with which it can execute itself at any moment.","The brain is viewed as an appendage of the genital glands.","There was need of a phantastic, indestructible optimism, and one far removed from all sense of reality, in order, for example, to discover in the shameful death of Christ really the highest salvation and the redemption of the world.","I can still recall vividly how Freud said to me, \\"My dear Jung, promise me never to abandon the sexual theory. That is the most essential thing of all. You see, we must make a dogma of it, an unshakable bulwark\\" ... In some astonishment I asked him, \\"A bulwark-against what?\\" To which he replied, \\"Against the black tide of mud\\"-and here he hesitated for a moment, then added of occultism.","I had to make a confession of faith in stone. That was the beginning of the tower, the house I built for myself at Bollingen.","Paul hardly ever allows the real Jesus of Nazareth to get a word in.","Our intellect has created a new world that dominates nature, and has populated it with monstrous machines.","What is essential in a work of art is that it should rise far above the realm of personal life and speak to the spirit and heart of the poet as man to the spirit and heart of mankind.","But India did not pass me by without a trace: it left tracks which lead me from one infinity to another infinity.","Between the dreams of night and day there is not so great a difference.","A sense of a wider meaning to one\'s existence is what raises a man beyond mere getting and spending. If he lacks this sense, he is lost and miserable.","In the final analysis, we count for something only because of the essential that we embody. If we do not embody that, life is wasted.","I had always been impressed by the fact that there are surprisingly many individuals who never use their minds if they can avoid it, and yet are not stupid, and an equal number who obviously do use their minds but in an amazingly stupid way.","One of the most difficult tasks men can perform, however much others may despise it, is the invention of good games.","We often dream about people from whom we receive a letter by the next post. I have ascertained on several occasions that at the moment when the dream occurred the letter was already lying in the post-office of the addressee.","Doesn\'t the world bring forth thinking in human heads with the same necessity that it brings forth blossoms on the plant?","Madness is a special form of the spirit and clings to all teachings and philosophies, but even more to daily life, since life itself is full of craziness and at bottom utterly illogical. Man strives toward reason only so that he can make rules for himself.","The secret of artistic creation and the effectiveness of art is to be found in a return to the state of \'participation mystique\' - to that level of experience at which it is man who lives, and not the individual.","It seems as if it is only through an experience of symbolic reality that man, vainly seeking his own \u201cexistence\u201d and making a philosophy out of it, can find his way back to a world in which he is no longer a stranger.","A book of mine is always a matter of fate. There is something unpredictable about the process of writing, and I cannot prescribe for myself any predetermined course.","Psychoanalysis cannot be considered a method of education if by education we mean the topiary art of clipping a tree into a beautiful artificial shape. But those who have a higher conception of education will prize most the method of cultivating a tree so that it fulfils to perfection its own natural conditions of growth.","The fact that astrology nevertheless yields valid results proves that it is not the apparent positions of the stars which work, but rather the times which are measured or determined by arbitrarily named stellar positions. Time thus proves to be a stream of energy filled with qualities and not, as our philosophy would have it, an abstract concept or precondition of knowledge.","The psychotherapist learns little or nothing from his successes. They mainly confirm him in his mistakes, while his failures, on the other hand, are priceless experiences in that they not only open up the way to a deeper truth, but force him to change his views and methods.","I could well imagine that I might have lived in former centuries and there encountered questions I was not yet able to answer; that I had been born again because I had not fulfilled the task given to me.","Dream analysis stands or falls with [the hypothesis of the unconscious]. Without it the dream appears to be merely a freak of nature, a meaningless conglomerate of memory-fragments left over from the happenings of the day.","I came to Freud for facts. I read \'The Interpretation of Dreams\' and I thought- \'Oh, here is a man who is not just theorizing away, here is a man who has got facts.","Modern man may assert that he can dispense with them, and he may bolster his opinion by insisting that there is no scientific evidence of their truth. But since we are dealing with invisible and unknowable things (for God is beyond human understanding, and there is no mean of proving immortality), why should we bother with evidence?","And what shall we know of this life on earth after death? The dissolution of our timebound form in eternity brings no loss of meaning. Rather, does the little finger know itself a member of the hand.","The time is a critical one, for it marks the beginning of the second half of life, when a metanoia, a mental transformation, not infrequently occurs. (on being 36 yrs old)","I have never since entirely freed myself of the impression that this life is a segment of existence which is enacted in a three-dimensional boxlike universe especially set up for it.","The teacher pretended that algebra was a perfectly natural affair, to be taken for granted, whereas I didn\'t even know what numbers were. Mathematics classes became sheer terror and torture to me. I was so intimidated by my incomprehension that I did not dare to ask any questions.","I have always said to my pupils: \\"Learn as much as you can about symbolism; then forget it when you are analyzing a dream.\\"","The girl dreams she is dangerously ill. Suddenly birds come out of her skin and cover her completely ... Swarms of gnats obscure the sun, the moon, and all the stars except one. That one start falls upon the dreamer.","The man of today, who resembles more or less the collective ideal, has made his heart into a den of murderers, as can easily be proved by the analysis of his unconscious, even though he himself is not in the least disturbed by it.","A purely psychological explanation is ruled out... the discs show signs of intelligent guidance, by quasi-human pilots.","There are cases where psychoanalysis works worse than anything else. But who said that psychoanalysis was to be applied always and everywhere.","There are as many archetypes as there are typical situations in life. Endless repetition has engraved these experiences into our psychic constitution, not in the forms of images filled with content, but at first only as forms without content, representing merely the possibility of a certain type of perception and action.","Hitler is a shy and friendly man with artistic tastes and gifts.","I hold the view that the alchemist\u2019s hope of conjuring out of matter the philosophical gold, or the panacea, or the wonderful stone, was only in part an illusion, an effect of projection; for the rest it corresponded to certain psychic facts that are of great importance in the psychology of the unconscious. As is shown by the texts and their symbolism, the alchemist projected what I have called the process of individuation into the phenomena of chemical change.","On the level of the Son there is no answer to the question of good and evil; there is only an incurable separation of the opposites. . . . It seems to me to be the Holy Spirit\'s task and charge to reconcile and reunite the opposites in the human individual through a special development of the human soul.","No concept is a carrier of life.","To make what fate intends for me my own intention","Yahweh [God] must become man precisely because he has done man a wrong. He, the guardian of justice, knows that every wrong must be expiated, and Wisdom knows that moral law is above even him. Because his creature has surpassed him he must regenerate himself","Gnosticism was stamped out completely and its remnants are so badly mangled that special study is needed to get any insight at all into its inner meaning.","The squaring of the circle is a stage on the way to the unconscious, a point of transition leading to a goal lying as yet unformulated beyond it. It is one of those paths to the centre.","All ages before ours believed in gods in some form or other. Only an unparalleled impoverishment in symbolism could enable us to rediscover the gods as psychic factors, which is to say, as archetypes of the unconscious. No doubt this discovery is hardly credible as yet.","Astrologers are influenced by theosophy, so they say, \\"That is very simple, it is just vibration!\\" ... But what is vibration? They say it is light energy, perhaps electricity, they are not quite informed. At all events the vibrations that could influence us have never been seen, so it remains just a word.","He who looks without, dreams; he who looks within, awakes.","In the last analysis, the essential thing is the life of individual. This alone makes history, here alone do the great transformations take place, and the whole future, the whole history of the world, ultimately springs as a gigantic summation from these hidden source in individuals.","The gods have become our diseases.","No dream symbol can be separated from the individual who dreams it, and there is no definite or straightforward interpretation of any dream.","I deliberately and consciously give preference to a dramatic, mythological way of thinking and speaking, because this is not only more expressive but also more exact than an abstract scientific terminology, which is wont to toy with the notion that its theoretic formulations may one fine day be resolved into algebraic equations.","The continuing, direct operation of the Holy Ghost on those who are called to be God\'s children implies, in fact, a broadening process of incarnation. Christ, the son begotten by God, is the first-born who is succeeded by an ever-increasing number of younger brothers and sisters. There are, however, neither begotten by the Holy Ghost nor born of a virgin. . . . Their lowly origin (possibly from the mammals) does not prevent them from entering into a close kinship with God as their father and Christ as their brother.","The Christian religion seems to have fulfilled its great biological purpose, in so far as we are able to judge. It has led human thought to independence, and has lost its significance, therefore, to a yet undetermined extent.... It seems to me that we might still make use in some way of its form of thought, and especially of its great wisdom of life, which for two thousand years has proven to be particularly efficacious.","Thanks to the acuteness of his mind, he saw through the poverty of philosophical and Gnostic knowledge, and contemptuously rejected it.","The dynamic principle of fantasy is play, a characteristic also of the child, and as such it appears inconsistent with the principle of serious work. But without this playing with fantasy no creative work has ever yet come to birth. The debt we owe to the play of imagination is incalculable. It is therefore short-sighted to treat fantasy, on account of its risky or unacceptable nature, as a thing of little worth.","It is the function of the Church to oppose all original experience, because this can only be unorthodox.","We do not know whether Hitler is going to found a new Islam. He is already on the way; he is like Muhammad.","Yoga in Mayfair or Fifth Avenue, or in any other place which is on the telephone, is a spiritual fake.","Hitler\'s unconscious seems to be female.","Hitler is a medicine man type of leader.","I don\'t believe. I know.","No language exists that cannot be misused... Every Interpretation is hypothetical, for it is a mere attempt to read an unfamiliar text.","The heaping together of paintings by Old Masters in museums is a catastrophe; likewise, a collection of a hundred Great Brains makes one big fathead.","Plato\'s world of ideas is beautiful.","My interests drew me in different directions. On the one hand I was powerfully attracted by science, with its truths based on facts; on the other hand I was fascinated by everything to do with comparative religion. [...] In science I missed the factor of meaning; and in religion, that of empiricism.","Medicines cure diseases, but only doctors can cure patients.","I have frequently seen people become neurotic when they content themselves with inadequate or wrong answers to the questions of life.","It had become clear to me, in a flash of illumination, that for me the only possible goal was psychiatry. Here alone the two currents of my interest could flow together and in a united stream dig their own bed. Here was the empirical field common to biological and spiritual facts, which I had everywhere sought and nowhere found. Here at last was the place where the collision of nature and spirit became a reality.","I am the triple owner of the world, the finest Turkey, the Lorelei, Germania and Helvetia of exclusively sweet butter and Naples, and I must supply the whole world with macaroni.","Metaphysical assertions, however, are statements of the psyche, and are therefore psychological.

I must have a dark side also If I am to be whole.","The acceptance of oneself is the essence of the whole moral problem and the epitome of a whole outlook on life. That I feed the hungry, that I forgive an insult, that I love my enemy in the name of Christ -- all these are undoubtedly great virtues. What I do unto the least of my brethren, that I do unto Christ. But what if I should discover that the least among them all, the poorest of all the beggars, the most impudent of all the offenders, the very enemy himself -- that these are within me, and that I myself stand in need of the alms of my own kindness -- that I myself am the enemy who must be loved -- what then? As a rule, the Christian\'s attitude is then reversed; there is no longer any question of love or long-suffering; we say to the brother within us \\"Raca,\\" and condemn and rage against ourselves. We hide it from the world; we refuse to admit ever having met this least among the lowly in ourselves.","Be silent and listen: have you recognized your madness and do you admit it? Have you noticed that all your foundations are completely mired in madness? Do you not want to recognize your madness and welcome it in a friendly manner? You wanted to accept everything. So accept madness too. Let the light of your madness shine, and it will suddenly dawn on you. Madness is not to be despised and not to be feared, but instead you should give it life...If you want to find paths, you should also not spurn madness, since it makes up such a great part of your nature...Be glad that you can recognize it, for you will thus avoid becoming its victim. Madness is a special form of the spirit and clings to all teachings and philosophies, but even more to daily life, since life itself is full of craziness and at bottom utterly illogical. Man strives toward reason only so that he can make rules for himself. Life itself has no rules. That is its mystery and its unknown law. What you call knowledge is an attempt to impose something comprehensible on life.","Where love rules, there is no will to power, and where power predominates, love is lacking.

That is the telling question of his life. Only if we know that the thing which truly matters is the infinite can we avoid fixing our interests upon futilities, and upon all kinds of goals which are not of real importance. Thus we demand that the world grant us recognition for qualities which we regard as personal possessions: our talent or our beauty. The more a man lays stress on false possessions, and the less sensitivity he has for what is essential, the less satisfying is his life. He feels limited because he has limited aims, and the result is envy and jealousy. If we understand and feel that here in this life we already have a link with the infinite, desires and attitudes change.","I shall not commit the fashionable stupidity of regarding everything I cannot explain as a fraud.\u2014address to the Society for Psychical Research in England","One does not become enlightened by imagining figures of light, but by making the darkness conscious.

The less we understand of what our [forebears] sought, the less we understand ourselves, and thus we help with all our might to rob the individual of his roots and his guiding instincts, so that he becomes a particle in the mass, ruled only by what Neitzche called the spirit of gravity.

Or do you not want to hear about all the noise of life and the world? But one thing you must know: the one thing I have learned is that one must live this life. Do you still know me? How long the separation lasted! Everything has become so different. And how did I find you? How strange my journey was! What words should I use to tell you on what twisted paths a good star has guided me to you? Give me your hand, my almost forgotten soul. How warm the joy at seeing you again, you long disavowed soul. Life has led me back to you. Let us thank the life I have lived for all the happy and all the sad hours, for every joy, for every sadness. My soul, my journey should continue with you. I will wander with you and ascend to my solitude.","The fact that a man who goes his own way ends in ruin means nothing ... He must obey his own law, as if it were a daemon whispering to him of new and wonderful paths ... There are not a few who are called awake by the summons of the voice, whereupon they are at once set apart from the others, feeling themselves confronted with a problem about which the others know nothing. In most cases it is impossible to explain to the others what has happened, for any understanding is walled off by impenetrable prejudices. \\"You are no different from anybody else,\\" they will chorus or, \\"there\'s no such thing,\\" and even if there is such a thing, it is immediately branded as \\"morbid\\"...He is at once set apart and isolated, as he has resolved to obey the law that commands him from within. \\"His own law!\\" everybody will cry.

Loneliness does not come from having no people about one, but from being unable to communicate the things that seem important to oneself, or from holding certain views which others find inadmissible.","A group experience takes place on a lower level of consciousness than the experience of an individual. This is due to the fact that, when many people gather together to share one common emotion, the total psyche emerging from the group is below the level of the individual psyche. If it is a very large group, the collective psyche will be more like the psyche of an animal, which is the reason why the ethical attitude of large organizations is always doubtful. The psychology of a large crowd inevitably sinks to the level of mob psychology. If, therefore, I have a so-called collective experience as a member of a group, it takes place on a lower level of consciousness than if I had the experience by myself alone.","\u200e\\"...the sole purpose of human existence is to kindle a light in the darkness of mere being.","Christians often ask why God does not speak to them, as he is believed to have done in former days. When I hear such questions, it always makes me think of the rabbi who asked how it could be that God often showed himself to people in the olden days whereas nowadays nobody ever sees him. The rabbi replied: \\"Nowadays there is no longer anybody who can bow low enough.\\"This answer hits the nail on the head. We are so captivated by and entangled in our subjective consciousness that we have forgotten the age-old fact that God speaks chiefly through dreams and visions. The Buddhist discards the world of unconscious fantasies as useless illusions; the Christian puts his Church and his Bible between himself and his unconscious; and the rational intellectual does not yet know that his consciousness is not his total psyche.","I have always been impressed by the fact that there are a surprising number of individuals who never use their minds if they can avoid it, and an equal number who do use their minds, but in an amazingly stupid way.","Out of evil, much good has come to me. By keeping quiet, repressing nothing, remaining attentive, and by accepting reality - taking things as they are, and not as I wanted them to be - by doing all this, unusual knowledge has come to me, and unusual powers as well, such as I could never have imagined before. I always thought that when we accepted things they overpowered us in some way or other. This turns out not to be true at all, and it is only by accepting them that one can assume and attitude towards them. So now I intend to play the game of life, being receptive to whatever comes to me, good and bad, sun and shadow forever alternating, and, in this way, also accepting my own nature with its positive and negative sides. Thus everything becomes more alive to me. What a fool I was! How I tried to force everything to go according to way I thought it ought to. an ex patient of C. G. Jung (Alchemical Studies, pg 47)","The sad truth is that man\'s real life consists of a complex of inexorable opposites\u2014day and night, birth and death, happiness and misery, good and evil. We are not even sure that one will prevail against the other, that good will overcome evil, or joy defeat pain. Life is a battleground. It always has been and always will be; and if it were not so, existence would come to an end.","Every transformation demands as its precondition \\"the ending of a world\\"-the collapse of an old philosophy of life.","Whatever we look at, and however we look at it, we see only through our own eyes.","Where your fear is,there is your task.","One of the main functions of organized religion is to protect people against a direct experience of God.","The meaning of my existence is that life has addressed a question to me.

Philemon represented a force which was not myself. In my fantasies I held conversations with him, and he said things which I had not consciously thought. For I observed clearly that it was he who spoke, not I. He said I treated thoughts as if I generated them myself, but in his view thoughts were like animals in the forest, or people in a room, or birds in the air, and added, \u201cIf you should see people in a room, you would not think that you had made those people, or that you were responsible for them. It was he who taught me psychic objectivity, the reality of the psyche. Through him the distinction was clarified between myself and the object of my thought. He confronted me in an objective manner, and I understood that there is something in me which can say things that I do not know and do not intend, things which may even be directed against me.\u201d","The change of character brought about by the uprush of collective forces is amazing. A gentle and reasonable being can be transformed into a maniac or a savage beast. One is always inclined to lay the blame on external circumstances, but nothing could explode in us if it had not been there. As a matter of fact, we are constantly living on the edge of a volcano, and there is, so far as we know, no way of protecting ourselves from a possible outburst that will destroy everybody within reach. It is certainly a good thing to preach reason and common sense, but what if you have a lunatic asylum for an audience or a crowd in a collective frenzy? There is not much difference between them because the madman and the mob are both moved by impersonal, overwhelming forces.","People will do anything, no matter how absurd, in order to avoid facing their own soul.

Let it band together into groups and organizations as much as it likes \u2013 it is just this banding together and the resultant extinction of the individual personality that makes it succumb so readily to a dictator. A million zeros joined together do not, unfortunately, add up to one. Ultimately everything depends on the quality of the individual, but our fatally short-sighted age thinks only in terms of large numbers and mass organizations, though one would think that the world had seen more than enough of what a well-disciplined mob can do in the hand of a single madman.","The time is a critical one, for it marks the beginning of the second half of life, when a metanoia, a mental transformation, not infrequently occurs.(on being 36 yrs old)","Fanaticism is always a sign of repressed doubt","You open the gates of the soul to let the dark flood of chaos flow into your order and meaning.

It that potential is not fulfilled, that life was wasted.","What did you do as a child that made the hours pass like minutes? Herein lies the key to your earthly pursuits.","Instead of the concrete individual, you have the names of organizations and, at the highest point, the abstract idea of the State as the principle of political reality. The moral responsibility of the individual is then inevitably replaced by the policy of the State (raison d\u2019etat). Instead of moral and mental differentiation of the individual, you have public welfare and the raising of the living standard. The goal and meaning of individual life (which is the only real life) no longer lie in the individual development but in the policy of the State, which is thrust upon the individual from outside and consists in the execution of an abstract idea which ultimately tends to attract all life to itself. The individual is increasingly deprived of the moral decision as to how he should live his own life, and instead is ruled, fed, clothed, and educated as a social unit, accommodated in the appropriate housing unit, and amused in accordance with the standards that give pleasure and satisfaction to the masses. The rulers, in their turn, are just as much social units as the ruled, and are distinguished only by the fact they are specialized mouthpieces of State doctrine. They do not need to be personalities capable of judgment, but thoroughgoing specialists who are unusable outside their line of business. State policy decides what shall be taught and studied.","It is under all circumstances an advantage to be in full possession of one\'s personality, otherwise the repressed elements will only crop up as a hindrance elsewhere, not just at some unimportant point, but at the very spot where we are most sensitive. If people can be educated to see the shadow-side of their nature clearly, it may be hoped that they will also learn to understand and love their fellow men better. A little less hypocrisy and a little more self-knowledge can only have good results in respect for our neighbor; for we are all too prone to transfer to our fellows the injustice and violence we inflict upon our own natures.","Synchronicity is the coming together of inner and outer events in a way that cannot be explained by cause and effect and that is meaningful to the observer.","I am a symbol of my soul.","Every step closer to my soul excites the scornful laughter of my devils, those cowardly ear-whisperers and poison-mixers.","What is essential in a work of art is that it should rise far above the realm of personal life and speak from the spirit and heart of the poet as man to the spirit and heart of mankind.","As long as you are not conscious of your self you can live; but if you become conscious of your self you fall from one grave into another. All your rebirths could ultimately make you sick. The Buddha therefore finally gave up on rebirth, for he had had enough of crawling through all human and animal forms. After all the rebirths you still remain the lion crawling on the earth, the Chameleon, a caricature, one prone to changing colors, a crawling shimmering lizard, but precisely not a lion, whose nature is related to the sun, who draws his power from within himself who does not crawl around in the protective colors of the environment, and who does not defend himself by going into hiding. I recognized the chameleon and no longer want to crawl on the earth and change colors and be reborn; instead I want to exist from my own force, like the sun which gives light and does not suck light.That belongs to the earth. I recall my solar nature and would like to rush to my rising. But ruins stand in my way They say: \'With regard to men you should be this or that.\' My chameleonesque skin shudders. They obtrude upon me and want to color me. But that should no longer be. Neither good nor evil shall be my masters. I push them aside, the laughable survivors, and go on my way again, which leads me to the East. The quarreling powers that for so long stood between me and myself lie behind me.","The psychological rule says that when an inner situation is not made conscious, it happens outside, as fate. That is to say, when the individual remains undivided and does not become conscious of his inner contradictions, the world must perforce act out the conflict and be torn into opposite halves.","Because we cannot discover God\'s throne in the sky with a radiotelescope or establish (for certain) that a beloved father or mother is still about in a more or less corporeal form, people assume that such ideas are \\"not true.\\" I would rather say that they are not \\"true\\" enough, for these are conceptions of a kind that have accompanied human life from prehistoric times, and that still break through into consciousness at any provocation.Modern man may assert that he can dispose with them, and he may bolster his opinion by insisting that there is no scientific evidence of their truth. Or he may even regret the loss of his convictions. But since we are dealing with invisible and unknowable things (for God is beyond human understanding, and there is no means of proving immortality), why should we bother about evidence? Even if we did not know by reason our need for salt in our food, we should nonetheless profit from its use. We might argue that the use of salt is a mere illusion of taste or a superstition; but it would still contribute to our well-being. Why, then, should we deprive ourselves of views that would prove helpful in crises and would give a meaning to our existence?And how do we know that such ideas are not true? Many people would agree with me if I stated flatly that such ideas are probably illusions. What they fail to realize is that the denial is as impossible to \\"prove\\" as the assertion of religious belief. We are entirely free to choose which point of view we take; it will in any case be an arbitrary decision.There is, however, a strong empirical reason why we should cultivate thoughts that can never be proved. It is that they are known to be useful. Man positively needs general ideas and convictions that will give a meaning to his life and enable him to find a place for himself in the universe. He can stand the most incredible hardships when he is convinced that they make sense; he is crushed when, on top of all his misfortunes, he has to admit that he is taking part in a \\"tale told by an idiot.\\"It is the role of religious symbols to give a meaning to the life of man. The Pueblo Indians believe that they are the sons of Father Sun, and this belief endows their life with a perspective (and a goal) that goes far beyond their limited existence. It gives them ample space for the unfolding of personality and permits them a full life as complete persons. Their plight is infinitely more satisfactory than that of a man in our own civilization who knows that he is (and will remain) nothing more than an underdog with no inner meaning to his life.","The dream shows the inner truth and reality of the patient as it really is: not as I conjecture it to be, and not as he would like it to be, but as it is.","But there is no energy unless there is a tension of opposites; hence it is necessary to discover the opposite to the attitude of the conscious mind.","INTUITION (L. intueri, \u2018to look at or into\u2019). I regard intuition as a basic psychological function (q.v.). It is the function that mediates perceptions in an unconscious way. Everything, whether outer or inner objects or their relationships, can be the focus of this perception. The peculiarity of intuition is that it is neither sense perception, nor feeling, nor intellectual inference, although it may also appear in these forms. In intuition a content presents itself whole and complete, without our being able to explain or discover how this content came into existence. Intuition is a kind of instinctive apprehension, no matter of what contents. Like sensation (q.v.), it is an irrational (q.v.) function of perception. As with sensation, its contents have the character of being \u201cgiven, in contrast to the \u201cderived\u201d or \u201cproduced\u201d character of thinking and feeling (qq.v.) contents. Intuitive knowledge possesses an intrinsic certainty and conviction, which enabled Spinoza (and Bergson) to uphold the scientia intuitiva as the highest form of knowledge. Intuition shares this quality with sensation (q.v.), whose certainty rests on its physical foundation. The certainty of intuition rests equally on a definite state of psychic \u201calertness\u201d of whose origin the subject is unconscious.\u201d","I feel it is the duty of one who goes his own way to inform society of what he finds on his voyage of discovery.","I myself found a fascinating example of this in Nietzsche\u2019s book Thus Spake Zarathustra, where the author reproduces almost word for word an incident reported in a ship\u2019s log for the year 1686. By sheer chance I had read this seaman\u2019s yarn in a book published about 1835 (half a century before Nietzsche wrote); and when I found the similar passage in Thus Spake Zarathustra, I was struck by its peculiar style, which was different from Nietzsche\u2019s usual language. I was convinced that Nietzsche must also have seen the old book, though he made no reference to it. I wrote to his sister, who was still alive, and she confirmed that she and her brother had in fact read the book together when he was 11 years old. I think, from the context, it is inconceivable that Nietzsche had any idea that he was plagiarizing this story. I believe that fifty years later it has unexpectedly slipped into focus in his conscious mind.","A million zeros joined together do not, unfortunately, add up to one. Ultimately everything depends on the quality of the individual, but our fatally shortsighted age thinks only in terms of large numbers and mass organizations, though one would think that the world had seen more than enough of what a well-disciplined mob can do in the hands of a single madman. Unfortunately, this realization does not seem to have penetrated very far - and our blindness is extremely dangerous.","... we are so full of apprehensions, fears, that we don\'t know exactly to what it points... a great change of our psychoglocal attitude is imminent, that is certain...because we need more understanding of human nature because ...the only real danger that exists is man himself... and we know nothing of man - his psyche should be studied because we are the origin of all coming evil...","The statistical method shows the facts in the light of the ideal average but does not give us a picture of their empirical reality. While reflecting an indisputable aspect of reality, it can falsify the actual truth in a most misleading way. This is particularly true of theories which are based on statistics. The distinctive thing about real facts, however, is their individuality. Not to put too fine a point on it, once could say that the real picture consists of nothing but exceptions to the rule, and that, in consequence, absolute reality has predominantly the character of irregularity.","To be \\"normal\\" is a splendid ideal for the unsuccessful,","If you go to thinking take your heart with you.

It was easy for them to laugh, since I had to do strange things.","Is it worth the lion\'s while to terrify the mouse?","Ultimately everything depends on the quality of the individual, but our fatally short-sighted age thinks only in terms of large numbers and mass organizations...","One book opens another.","At first we cannot see beyond the path that leads downward to dark and hateful things but no light or beauty will ever come from the man who cannot bear this sight. Light is always born of darkness, and the sun never yet stood still in heaven to satisfy man\'s longing or to still his fears.","The stone has no uncertainties, no urge to communicate, and is eternally the same for thousands of years, while I am only a passing phenomenon which bursts into all kinds of emotions, like a flame that flares up quickly and then goes out.","Image is psyche.","Much of the evil in this world is due to the fact that man, in general, is hopelessly unconscious.","As far as we can discern, the sole purpose of human existence is to kindle a light in the darkness of mere being. It may even be assumed that just as the unconscious affects us, so the increase in our consciousness affects the unconscious.","I, too, lived\u2014which I had not done before, and which I could still do. I lived into the depths, and the depths began to speak. The depths taught me the other truth. It thus united sense and nonsense in me. I had to recognize that I am only the expression and symbol of the soul. In the sense of the spirit of the depths, I am as I am in this visible world a symbol of my soul, and I am thoroughly a serf, completely subjugated, utterly obedient. The spirit of the depths taught me to say: \u201cI am the servant of a child. Through this dictum I learn above all the most extreme humility, as what I most need.\u201d","The artist\'s life cannot be otherwise than full of conflicts, for two forces are at war within him; on the one hand, the common human longing for happiness, satisfaction and security in life and on the other, a ruthless passion for creation which may go so far as to override every personal desire... there are hardly any exceptions to the rule that a person must pay dearly for the divine gift of creative fire.","I also had to detach myself from my thoughts through turning my desire away from them. And at once, I noticed that my self became a desert, where only the sun of unquiet desire burned. I was overwhelmed by the endless infertility of this desert. Even if something could have thrived there, the creative power of desire was still absent. Wherever the creative power of desire is, there springs the soil\'s own seed. But do not forget to wait. Did you not see that when your creative force turned to the world, how the dead things moved under it and through it, how they grew and prospered, and hour your thoughts flowed in rich rivers? If your creative force now turns to the place of the soul, you will see how your soul becomes green and how its field bears wonderful fruit.","Nobody can spare themselves the waiting and most will be unable to bear this torment, but will throw themselves with greed back at men, things, and thoughts, whose slaves they will become from then on. Since then it will have been clearly proved that this man is incapable of enduring beyond things, men, and thoughts, and they will hence become his master and he will become their fool, since he cannot be without them, not until even his soul has become a fruitful field. Also he whose soul is a garden, needs things, men, and thoughts, but he is their friend and not their slave and fool.","For the alchemist the one primarily in need of redemption is not man, but the deity who is lost and sleeping in matter. Only as a secondary consideration does he hope that some benefit may accrue to himself from the transformed substance as the panacea, the\xa0medicina catholica, just as it may to the imperfect bodies, the base or \\"sick\\" metals, etc. His attention is not directed to his own salvation through God\'s grace, but to the liberation of God from the darkness of matter.","In the interview, he gave an example of a man who falls head over heels in love, then later in life regrets his blind choice as he finds that he has married his own anima\u2013the unconscious idea of the feminine in his mind, rather than the woman herself.","The difference between the \\"natural\\" individuation process, which runs its course unconsciously, and the one which is consciously realized, is tremendous. In the first case consciousness nowhere intervenes; the end remains as dark as the beginning. In the second case so much darkness comes to light that the personality is permeated with light, and consciousness necessarily gains in scope and insight. The encounter between conscious and unconscious has to ensure that the light which shines in the darkness is not only comprehended by the darkness, but comprehends it. The filius solis et lunae (the son of the Sun and Moon) is the possible result as well as the symbol of this union of opposites. It is the alpha and omega of the process, the mediator and intermedius. \\"It has a thousand names,\\" say the alchemists, meaning that the source from which the individuation process rises and the goal toward which it aims is nameless, ineffable.","Christians often ask why God does not speak to them, as he is believed to have done in former days. When I hear such questions, it always makes me think of the rabbi who was asked how it could be that God often showed himself to people in the olden days while nowadays nobody ever sees him. The rabbi replied: \\"Nowadays there is now longer anybody who can bow low enough.\\"This answer hits the nail on the head. We are so captivated by and entangled in our subjective consciousness that we have forgotten the age-old fact that God speaks chiefly through dreams and visions. The Buddhist discards the world of unconscious fantasies as useless illusions; the Christian puts his Church and his Bible between himself and his unconscious; and the rational intellectual does not yet know that his consciousness is not his total psyche. This ignorance persists today in spite of the fact that for more than 70 years the unconscious has been a basic scientific concept that is indispensable to any serious psychological investigation.","The book [Joyce\'s \\"Ulysses\\"] can just as well be read backwards, for it has no back and no front, no top and no bottom. Everything could easily have happened before, or might have happened afterwards. You can read any of the conversations just as pleasurably backwards, for you don\'t miss the point of the gags. Every sentence is a gag, but taken together they make no point. You can also stop in the middle of a sentence--the first half still makes sense enough to live by itself, or at least seems to. The whole work has the character of a worm cut in half, that can grow a new head or a new tail as required.","\u0625\u0646 \u0641\u064a \u062f\u0627\u062e\u0644 \u0643\u0644\u064d\u0651 \u0645\u0646\u0627 \u0634\u062e\u0635\u0627\u064b \u0622\u062e\u0631 \u0644\u0627 \u0646\u0639\u0631\u0641\u0647","At times I feel as if I am spread out over the landscape and inside things, and am myself living in every tree, in the splashing of the waves, in the clouds and the animals that come and go, in the procession of the seasons. There is nothing in the Tower that has not grown into its own form over the decades, nothing with which I am not linked. Here everything has its history, and mine; here is space for the spaceless kingdom of the world\'s and the psyche\'s hinterland.","The spirit of the depths even taught me to consider my action and my decision as dependent on dreams. Dreams pave the way for life, and they determine you without you understanding their language. One would like to learn this language, but who can teach and learn it? Scholarliness alone is not enough; there is a knowledge of the heart that gives deeper insight. The knowledge of the heart is in no book and is not to be found in the mouth of any teacher, but grows out of you like the green seed from the dark earth. Scholarliness belongs to the spirit of this time, but this spirit in no way grasps the dream, since the soul is everywhere that scholarly knowledge is not.","Even a scientist is a human being. So it is natural for him, like others, to hate the things he cannot explain. It is a common illusion to believe that what we know today is all we ever can know. Nothing is more vulnerable than scientific theory, which is an ephemeral attempt to explain facts and not an everlasting truth in itself.","The mirror does not flatter, it faithfully shows whatever looks into it; namely, the face we never show to the world because we cover it with the persona, the mask of the actor.","Everybody acts out a myth, but very few people know what their myth is. And you should know what your myth is because it might be a tragedy and maybe you dont want it to be.","The mass State has no intention of promoting mutual understanding and the relationship of man to man; it strives, rather, for atomization, for the psychic isolation of the individual.","But the shadow is merely somewhat inferior, primitive, unadapted, and awkward; not wholly bad. It even contains childish or primitive qualities which would in a way vitalize and embellish human existence, but convention forbids!","There are two reasons why man loses contact with the regulating center of his soul. One of them is that some single instinctive drive or emotional image can carry him into a one-sidedness that makes him lose his balance. This also happens to animals; for example, a sexually excited stag will completely forget hunger and security. This one-sidedness and consequent loss of balance are much dreaded by primitives, who call it, \\"loss of soul.\\" Another threat to the inner balance comes from excessive daydreaming, which in a secret way usually circles around particular complexes. In fact, daydreams arise just because they connect a man with his complexes; at the same time they threaten the concentration and continuity of his consciousness.The second obstacle is exactly the opposite, and is due to an over-consolidation of ego-consciousness. Although a disciplined consciousness is necessary for the performance of civilized activities (we know what happens if a railway signalman lapses into daydreaming), it has the serious disadvantage that it is apt to block the reception of impulses and messages coming from the center. This is why so many dreams of civilized people are concerned with restoring this receptivity by attempting to correct the attitude of consciousness toward the unconscious center of Self.","I simply believe that some part of the human Self or Soul is not subject to the laws of space and time.","Depression is like a woman in black. If she turns up, don\u2019t shoo her away. Invite her in, offer her a seat, treat her like a guest and listen to what she wants to say.","The dictator State has one great advantage over bourgeois reason: along with the individual it swallows up his religious forces. The State takes the place of God; that is why, seen from this angle, the socialist dictatorships are religions and State slavery is a form of worship. But the religious function cannot be dislocated and falsified in this way without giving rise to secret doubts, which are immediately repressed so as to avoid conflict with the prevail trend towards mass-mindedness. [\u2026] The policy of the State is exalted to a creed, the leader or party boss becomes a demigod beyond good and evil, and his votaries are honoured as heroes, martyrs, apostles, missionaries. There is only one truth and beside it no other. It is sacrosanct and above criticism. Anyone who thinks differently is a heretic, who, as we know from history, is threatened with all manner of unpleasant things. Only the party boss, who holds the political power in his hands, can interpret the State doctrine authentically, and he does so just as suits him.","I early arrived at the insight that when no answer comes from within to the problems and complexities of life, they ultimately mean very little. Outward circumstances are no substitute for inner experience.","Whoever speaks in primordial images speaks with a thousand voices; he enthrals and overpowers...he transmutes our personal destiny into the destiny of mankind, and evokes in us all those beneficent forces that ever and anon have enabled humanity to find refuge from every peril and to outlive the longest night.","We put thirty spokes together and call it a wheel; But it is on the space where there is nothing that the utility of the wheel depends. We turn clay to make a vessel; But it is on the space where there is nothing that the utility of the vessel depends. We pierce doors and windows to make a house; And it is on these spaces where there is nothing that the utility of the house depends. Therefore just as we take advantage of what is, we should recognize the utility of what is not. [Ch. XL]","The infantile dream-state of the mass man is so unrealistic that he never thinks to ask who is paying for this paradise. The balancing of accounts is left to a higher political or social authority, which welcomes the task, for its power is thereby increased; and the more power it has, the weaker and more helpless the individual becomes.","Man as we realize if we reflect for a moment, never perceives anything fully or comprehends anything completely. He can see, hear, touch, and taste; but how far he sees, how well he hears, what his touch tells him, and what he tastes depend upon the number and quality of his senses. These limit his perception of the world around him. By using scientific instruments he can partly compensate for the deficiencies of his senses. For example, he can extend the range of his vision by binoculars or of his hearing by electrical amplification. But the most elaborate apparatus cannot do more than bring distant or small objects within range of his eyes, or make faint sounds more audible. No matter what instruments he uses, at some point he reaches the edge of certainty beyond which conscious knowledge cannot pass.","The real mystery does not behave mysteriously or secretively; it speaks a secret language, it adumbrates itself by a variety of images which all indicate its true nature. I am not speaking of a secret personally guarded by someone, with a content known to its possessor, but of a mystery, a matter or circumstance which is \u201csecret, i.e., known only through vague hints but essentially unknown. The real nature of matter was unknown to the alchemist: he knew it only in hints. In seeking to explore it he projected the unconscious into the darkness of matter in order to illuminate it. In order to explain the mystery of matter he projected yet another mystery - his own psychic background -into what was to be explained: Obscurum per obscurius, ignotum per ignotius! This procedure was not, of course, intentional; it was an involuntary occurrence.\u201d","It seemed to me I was living in an insane asylum of my own making. I went about with all these fantastic figures: centaurs, nymphs, satyrs, gods and goddesses, as though they were patients and I was analyzing them. I read a Greek or Negro myth as if a lunatic were telling me his anamnesis.","Like plants, so men also grow, some in the light, others in the shadows. There are many who need the shadows and not the light.","Wholly unprepared, we embark upon the second half of life. Or are there perhaps colleges for forty-year-olds which prepare them for their coming life and its demands as the ordinary colleges introduce our young people to a knowledge of the world? No, thoroughly unprepared we take the step into the afternoon of life; worse still we take this step with the false assumption that our truths and ideals will serve us as hitherto. But we cannot live the afternoon of life according to the program of life\'s morning; for what was great in the morning will be little at evening, and what in the morning was true will at evening have become a lie.","Finch\xe9 non prenderai coscienza l\'inconscio governer\xe0 la tua vita.E tu lo chiamerai destino.","Heaven has become for us the cosmic space of the physicists... But \'the heart glows,\' and a secret unrest gnaws at the roots of our being.","If the demand for self-knowledge is willed by fate and is refused, this negative attitude may end in real death. The demand would not have come to this person had he still been able to strike out on some promising by-path. But he is caught in a blind alley from which only self-knowledge can extricate him. If he refuses this then no other way is left open to him. Usually he is not conscious of his situation, either, and the more unconscious he is the more he is at the mercy of unforeseen dangers: he cannot get out of the way of a car quickly enough, in climbing a mountain he misses his foothold somewhere, out skiing he thinks he can negotiate a tricky slope, and in an illness he suddenly loses the courage to live. The unconscious has a thousand ways of snuffing out a meaningless existence with surprising swiftness.","The alchemist saw the union of opposites under the symbol of the tree, and it is therefore not surprising that the unconscious of present-day man, who no longer feels at home in his world and can base his existence neither on the past that is no more nor on the future that is yet to be, should hark back to the symbol of the cosmic tree rooted in this world and growing up to heaven - the tree that is also man. In the history of symbols this tree is described as the way of life itself, a growing into that which eternally is and does not change; which springs from the union of opposites and, by its eternal presence, also makes that union possible. It seems as if it were only through an experience of symbolic reality that man, vainly seeking his own \u201cexistence and making a philosophy out of it, can find his way back to a world in which he is no longer a stranger.\u201d","To be normal is the ideal aim for the unsuccessful.","Meaninglessness inhibits fullness of life and is therefore equivalent to illness. Meaning makes a great many things endurable-perhaps everything.\\"-Memories, Dreams, Reflections","Anthropologists have often described what happens to a primitive society when its spiritual values are exposed to the impact of modern civilization. Its people lose the meaning of their lives, their social organization disintegrates, and they themselves morally decay. We are now in the same condition. But we have never really understood what we have lost, for our spiritual leaders unfortunately were more interested in protecting their institutions than in understanding the mystery that symbols present. In my opinion, faith does not exclude thought (which is man\'s strongest weapon), but unfortunately many believers seem to be so afraid of science (and incidentally of psychology) that they turn a blind eye to the numinous psychic powers that forever control man\'s fate. We have stripped all things of their mystery and numinosity; nothing is holy any longer.","Our psyche is set up in accord with the structure of the universe, and what happens in the macrocosm likewise happens in the infinitesimal and most subjective reaches of the psyche.","The more critical reason dominates, the more impoverished life becomes. When reason is overvalued, the individual suffers a loss. Relying more on facts and rationality than on imagination and theory detracts from the quality of a person\'s intellectual life.","As a consequence there are many people who becomeneurotic because they are only normal, as there arepeople who are neurotic because they cannot becomenormal. For the former the very thought that you wantto educate them to normality is a nightmare; theirdeepest need is really to be able to lead \\"abnormal\\"lives.","Only what is really oneself has the power to heal.","CG Jung:Thoughts grow in me like a forest, populated by many different animals. But man is domineering in his thinking, and therefore he kills the pleasure of the forest and that of the wild animals. Man is violent in his desire, and he himself becomes a darker forest and a sickened forest animal. Just as I have freedom in the world, I also have freedom in my thoughts. Freedom is conditional.","But what if I should discover that the least among them all, the poorest of all beggars, the most impudent of all offenders, yea the very fiend himself - that these are within me, and that I myself stand in need of my own kindness, that I myself am the enemy who must be loved - what then? Then, as a rule, the whole truth of Christianity is reversed: there is no more talk of love and long-suffering; we say to the brother within us, \\"Raca,\\" and condemn and rage against ourselves. We hide him from the world; we deny ever having met this least among the lowly in ourselves, and had it been God himself who drew near to us in this despicable form, we should have denied him a thousand times before a single cock had crowed.","We should grow like a tree that likewise does not know its law.

But the unconscious infections of groups of so-called normal people are more subtle and far more dangerous.","If I want to understand an individual human being, I must lay aside all scientific knowledge of the average man and discard all theories in order to adopt a completely new and unprejudiced attitude. I can only approach the task of understanding with a free and open mind, whereas knowledge of man, or insight into human character, presupposes all sorts of knowledge about mankind in general.","If you cannot understand why someone did something, look at the consequences\u2014and infer the motivation.","It would be a ridiculous and unwarranted presumption on our part if we imagined that we were more energetic or more intelligent than the men of the past\u2014our material knowledge has increased, but not our intelligence.","That which we do not bring to consciousness appears in our lives as fate","If it be true that there can be no metaphysics transcending human reason, it is no less true that there can be no empirical knowledge that is not already caught and limited by the a priori structure of cognition.","\u2026 the paradox is one of our most valued spiritual possessions...","it is of the greatest importance that the ego should be anchored in the world of consciousness and that consciousness should be reinforced by a very precise adaptation. For this, certain virtues like attention, conscientiousness, patience, etc., are of great value on the moral side, just as accurate observation of the symptomatology of the unconscious and objective selfcriticism are valuable on the intellectual side.","Aquel que no ha pasado a traves del infierno de sus pasiones, no las ha superado nunca...","Everything to come was already in images: to find their soul, the ancients went into the desert. This is an image. The ancients lived their symbols, since the world had not yet become real for them. Thus they went into the solitude of the desert to teach us that the place of the soul is a lonely desert. There they found the abundance of visions, the fruits of the desert, the wondrous flowers of the soul. Think diligently about the images that the ancients have left behind. They show the way of what is to come. Look back at the collapse of empires, growth and death, of the desert and monasteries, they are the images of what is to come. Everything has been foretold. But who knows how to interpret it?When you say that the place of the soul is not, then it is not. But if you say that it is, then it is. Notice what the ancients said in images: the words is a creative act. The ancients said: in the beginning was the Word. Consider this and think upon it.The words that oscillate between nonsense and supreme meaning are the oldest and truest.","I swayed between fear, defiance, and nausea, and was wholly the prey of my passion.

Either I know a thing, and then I know it - I don\'t need to believe it","As understanding deepens, the further removed it becomes from knowledge.","the goal of psychic development is the self. There is no linear evolution; there is only a circumambulation of the self.","Among the so-called neurotics of our day there are a good many who in other ages would not have been neurotic-that is, divided against themselves. If they had lived in a period and in a milieu in which man was still linked by myth with the world of the ancestors, and thus with nature truly experienced and not merely seen from outside, they would have been spared this division with themselves. I am speaking of those who cannot tolerate the loss of myth and who can neither find a way to a merely exterior world, to the world as seen by science, nor rest satisfied with an intellectual juggling with words, which has nothing whatsoever to do with wisdom.","Bass bands, flags, banners, parades, and monster demonstrations are no different in principle from ecclesiastical processions, cannonades, and fireworks to scare off demons. Only, the suggestive parade of State power engenders a collective feeling of security which, unlike religious demonstrations, give the individual no protection against his inner demonism. Hence he will cling all the more to the power of the State, i.e., to the mass, thus delivering himself up to it psychically as well as morally and putting the finishing touch to his social depotentiation. The State, like the Church, demands enthusiasm, self-sacrifice, and love, and if religion requires or presupposes the \u201cfear of God, then the dictator State takes good care to provide the necessary terror.\u201d","I thought perhaps she was crazy, but she was only highly intuitive.","We are always human and we should never forget the burden of being only human","Remember that you can know yourself, and with that you know enough. But you cannot know others and everything else. Beware of knowing what lies beyond yourself, or else your presumed knowledge will suffocate the life of those who know themselves. A knower may know himself. That is his limit.\\"\u2014 Carl Gustav Jung","I am accused of mysticism. I do not, however, hold myself responsible for the fact that man has, everywhere and always, spontaneously developed religious forms of expression, and that the human psyche from time immemorial has been shot through with religious feelings and ideas. Whoever cannot see this aspect of the human psyche is blind, and whoever chooses to explain it away, or to \\"enlighten\\" it away, has no sense of reality.","In everything regarding your salvation and the attainment of mercy, you are dependent on your soul. Thus no sacrifice can be too great for you. If your virtues hinder you from salvation, discard them, since they have become evil to you. The slave to virtue finds the way as little as the slave to vices.","For the hero, fear is a challenge and a task, because only boldness can deliver from fear. And if the risk is not taken, the meaning of life is somehow violated, and the whole future is condemned to hopeless staleness, to a drab grey lit only by will-o\u2019-the-wisps.","In order to understand the symbolic indications of the unconscious, one must be careful not to get outside oneself or \\"beside oneself,\\" but to stay emotionally within oneself. Indeed, it is vitally important that the ego should continue to function in normal ways. Only if I remain an ordinary human being, conscious of my incompleteness, can I become receptive to the significant contents and processes of the unconscious. But how can a human being stand the tension of feeling himself at one with the whole universe, while at the same time he is only a miserable earthly human creature? If, on the one hand, I despise myself as merely a statistical cipher, my life has no meaning and is not worth living. But if, on the other hand, I feel myself to be part of something much greater, how am I to keep my feet on the ground? It is very difficult indeed to keep these inner opposites united within oneself without toppling over into one or the other extreme.","But no matter how much parents and grandparents may have sinned against the child, the man who is really adult will accept these sins as his own condition which has to be reckoned with. Only a fool is interested in other people\'s guilt, since he cannot alter it. The wise man learns only from his own guilt. He will ask himself: Who am I that all this should happen to me? To find the answer to this fateful question he will look into his own heart.","We only gain merit and psychological development by accepting ourselves as we are and by being serious enough to live the lives we are entrusted with. Our sins and errors and mistakes are necessary to us, otherwise we are deprived of the most precious incentives to development.","But it seems to me to be an imperfection in things of beauty, and a weakness in man, if an explanation from the shallow-side has a destructive effect. The horror which we feel for Freudian interpretations is entirely due to our own barbaric or childish naivete, which believes that there can be heights without corresponding depths, and which blinds us to the really \\"final\\" truth that, when carried to extremes, opposites meet.","It was only after the illness that I understood how important it is to affirm one\u2019s own destiny. In this way we forge an ego that does not break down when incomprehensible things happen; an ego that endures, that endures the truth, and that is capable of coping with the world and with fate. Then, to experience defeat is also to experience victory. Nothing is disturbed\u2014neither inwardly nor outwardly, for one\u2019s own continuity has withstood the current of life and of time. But that can come to pass only when one does not meddle inquisitively with the workings of fate. I","I have done without electricity, and tend the fireplace and stove myself.

If the man who had this dream had not been sensible about his shadow problem, he could easily have identified the desperate Frenchman with the \\"dangerous Communists\\" of outer life, or the official plus the prosperous man with the \\"grasping capitalists.\\" In this way he would have avoided seeing that he had within him such warring elements. If people observe their own unconscious tendencies in other people, this is called a \\"projection.\\" Political agitation in all countries is full of such projections, just as much as the backyard gossip of little groups and individuals. Projections of all kinds obscure our view of our fellow men, spoiling its objectivity, and thus spoiling all possibility of genuine human relationships.","People think you have only to \u2018tell\u2019 a person that he \u2018ought\u2019 to do something in order to put him on the right track. But whether he can or will do it is another matter.","I should give myself completely into your hands\u2014but who are you? I do not trust you. Not once to trust, is that my love for you, my joy in you? Do I not trust every valiant man, and not you, my soul? Your hand lies heavy on me, but I will, I will.

Thus it is that, of all the professionals, the medical man has the least opportunity of developing the function of thinking.\u201d","The debt we owe to the play of the imagination is incalculable.","The psyche is a self-regulating system that maintains itself in equilibrium as the body does.","There is a desert on the moon where the dreamer sinks so deeply into the ground that she reaches hell.","The erotic instinct is something questionable, and will always be so whatever a future set of laws may have to say on the matter. It belongs, on the one hand, to the original animal nature of man, which will exist as long as man has an animal body. On the other hand, it is connected with the highest forms of the spirit. But it blooms only when the spirit and instinct are in true harmony. If one or the other aspect is missing, then an injury occurs, or at least there is a one-sided lack of balance which easily slips into the pathological. Too much of the animal disfigures the civilized human being, too much culture makes a sick animal.","There is no such thing as a pure introvert or extrovert. Such a person would be in the lunatic asylum.","Although my belief in the world returned to me, I have never since entirely freed myself of the impression that this life is a segment of existence which is enacted in a three-dimensional boxlike universe especially set up for it.","Only in the first hour of the night can I become human, while the male dove is busy with the twelve dead.\'--Black Book 2","In studying the history of the human mind one is impressed again and again by the fact that the growth of the mind is the widening of the range of consciousness, and that each step forward has been a most painful and laborious achievement. One could almost say that nothing is more hateful to man than to give up even a particle of his unconsciousness. Ask those who have tried to introduce a new idea!","Communion gives us warmth.Singleness gives us light.At immeasurable distance stands one single star at the zenith.This star is the God and goal of humanity.In this world one is Abraxas,creater and destroyer of one\'s world.","...the mind that is collectively orientated is quite incapable of thinking and feeling in any other way than by projection.","In psychology it is very important that the doctor should not strive to heal at all costs. One has to be exceedingly careful not to impose one\'s own will and conviction on the patient. You have to give him a certain amount of freedom. You can\'t wrest people away from their fate, just as in medicine you cannot cure a patient if nature means him to die. Sometimes it is really a question whether you are allowed to rescue a man from the fate he must undergo for the sake of his further development.","The individual is increasinglydeprived of the moral decision as to how he should livehis own life, and instead is ruled, fed, clothed and educated asa social unit, accommodated in the appropriate housing unit,and amused in accordance with the standards that give pleasureand satisfaction to the masses.","The more civilized, the more conscious and complicated a man is, the less he is able to follow his instincts. His complicated living conditions and the influence of his environment are so strong that they drown the quiet voice of nature. Opinions, beliefs, theories, and collective tendencies appear in its stead and back up all the aberrations of the conscious mind. Deliberate attention should then be given to the unconscious so that the compensation can set to work.","My friends, it is wise to nourish the soul, otherwise you will breed dragons and devils in your heart.","When a person tries to obey the unconscious, he will often, as we have seen, be unable to do just as he pleases. But equally he will often be unable to do what other people want him to do. It often happens, for instance, that he must separate from his group-from his family, his partner, or other personal connections-in order to find himself. That is why it is sometimes said that attending to the unconscious makes people antisocial and egocentric. As a rule this is not true, for there is a little-known factor that enters into this attitude: the collective (or, we could even say, social) aspect of the Self.","Indeed, I do not forget that my voice is but one voice, my experience a mere drop in the sea, my knowledge no greater than the visual field in a microscope, my mind\'s eye a mirror that reflects a small corner of the world, and my ideas--a subjective confession.","what is illusion? By what criterion do we judge something to be an illusion? Does there exist for the psyche anything which we may call \\"illusion\\"? What we are pleased to call such may be for the psyche a most important factor of life\u2014something as indispensable as oxygen for the organism\u2014a psychic actuality of prime importance. Presumably the psyche does not trouble itself about our categories of reality, and it would therefore be the better part of wisdom for us to say: everything that acts is actual.","Nothing so promotes the growth of consciousness as [the] inner confrontation of opposites.","It is painful\u2014there is no denying it\u2014to interpret radiant things from the shadow-side, and thus in a measure reduce them to their origins in dreary filth. But it seems to me to be an imperfection in things of beauty, and a weakness in man, if an explanation from the shadow-side has a destructive effect.","Carl Jung never said: \u201cThere is no coming to consciousness without pain. People will do anything, no matter how absurd, in order to avoid facing their own Soul. One does not become enlightened by imagining figures of light, but by making the darkness conscious. What Dr. Jung said in two separate and unrelated statements was:Seldom, or perhaps never, does a marriage develop into an individual relationship smoothly and without crises; there is no coming to consciousness without pain. ~Carl Jung, Contributions to Analytical Psychology, P. 193People will do anything, no matter how absurd, in order to avoid facing their own souls. One does not become enlightened by imagining figures of light, but by making the darkness conscious. ~Carl Jung, Psychology and Alchemy, Page 99.\u201d","(In fact, passion that goes beyond the natural measure of love ultimately aims at the mystery of becoming whole, and this is why one feels, when he has fallen passionately in love, that becoming one with the other person is the only worthwhile goal of one\'s life.)","Scientific education is based in the main on statistical truths and abstract knowledge and therefore imparts an unrealistic, rational picture of the world, in which the individual, as a merely marginal phenomenon, plays no role. The individual, however, as an irrational datum, is the true and authentic carrier of reality, the concrete man as opposed to the unreal ideal or \u201cnormal man to whom the scientific statements refer.\u201d","Apart from the agglomeration of huge masses in which the individual disappears anyway, one of the chief factors responsible for psychological mass-mindedness is scientific rationalism, which robs the individual of his foundations and his dignity. As a social unit he has lost his individuality and become a mere abstract number in the bureau of statistics. He can only play the role of an interchangeable unit of infinitesimal importance. Looked at rationally and from outside, that is exactly what he is, and from this point of view it seems positively absurd to go on talking about the value or meaning of the individual.","Funnily enough, \u201cself-criticism is an idea much in vogue in Marxist countries, but there it is subordinated to ideological considerations and must serve the State, and not truth and justice in men\u2019s dealing with one another. The mass State has no intention of promoting mutual understanding and the relationship of man to man; it strives, rather, for atomization, for the psychic isolation of the individual. The more unrelated individuals are, the more consolidated the State becomes, and vice versa.\u201d","Not the criticism of individual contemporaries will decide the truth or falsity of these discoveries, but future generations. There are things that are not yet true today, perhaps we dare not find them true, but tomorrow they may be. So every man whose fate it is to go his individual way must proceed with hopefulness and watchfulness, ever conscious of his loneliness and its dangers.","Because the eye gazes but can catch no glimpse of it, It is called elusive. Because the ear listens but cannot hear it, It is called the rarefied. Because the hand feels for it but cannot find it, It is called the infinitesimal. \u2026 These are called the shapeless shapes, Forms without form, Vague semblances. Go towards them, and you can see no front; Go after them, and you see no rear.","The conflict between science and religion is in reality a misunderstanding of both. Scientific materialism has merely introduced a new hypostasis, and that is an intellectual sin. It has given another name to the supreme principle of reality and has assumed that this created a new thing and destroyed and old thing. Whether you call the principle of existence \\"God,\\" \\"matter,\\" \\"energy,\\" or anything else you like, you have created nothing; you have simply changed a symbol. The materialist is a metaphysician malgr\xe9 lui.","The State in particular is turned into a quasi-animate personality from whom everything is expected. In reality it is only a camouflage for those individuals who know how to manipulate it.","When, for instance, a highly esteemed professor in his seventies abandons his family and runs off with a young red-headed actress, we know that the gods have claimed another victim.","But if we understand anything of the unconscious, we know that it cannot be swallowed. We also know that it is dangerous to suppress it, because the unconscious is life and this life turns against us if suppressed, as happens in neurosis. Conscious and unconscious do not make a whole when one of them is suppressed and injured by the other. If they must contend, at least let it be a fair fight with equal rights on both sides. Both are aspects of life. Consciousness should defend its reason and protect itself, and the chaotic life of the unconscious should be given the chance of having its way too - as much of it as we can stand. This means open conflict and open collaboration at once. That, evidently, is the way human life should be. It is the old game of hammer and anvil: between them the patient iron is forged into an indestructible whole, an \u2018individual.\u2019 This, roughly, is what I mean by the individuation process.","Unfortunately there can be no doubt that man is, on the whole, less good than he imagines himself or wants to be. Everyone carries a shadow, and the less it is embodied in the individual\'s conscious life, the blacker and denser it is. If an inferiority is conscious, one always has a chance to correct it. Furthermore, it is constantly in contact with other interests, so that it is continually subjected to modifications. But if it is repressed and isolated from consciousness, it never gets corrected.","at this moment I came upon myself. Previously I had existed, too, but everything had merely happened to me. Now I happened to myself. Now I knew: I am myself now, now I exist. Previously I had been willed to do this and that; now I willed.","In the last analysis, most of our difficulties come from losing contact with our instincts, with the age-old forgotten wisdom stored up in us.","One cannot live from anything except what one is.","Only man as an individual human being lives; the state is just a system, a mere machine for sorting and tabulating the masses. Anyone, therefore, who thinks in terms of men minus the individual, in huge numbers, atomizes himself and becomes a thief and a robber to himself. He is infected with the leprosy of collective thinking and has become an inmate of that insalubrious stud-farm called the totalitarian State. Our","But when a thing is tangibly idiotic, you can be sure that it is very powerful, very dangerous. You see, when we call a thing stupid, we think that we undo it, that we have overcome it somehow. Of course nothing of the sort happens; we have simply made a statement that it is very important, have advertised it, and it appeals to everybody. People think, thank heaven, here is something we can understand, and they eat it. But if we say something is very intelligent, they vanish and won\'t touch it.","In general, the heart seems to have a more reliable memory for what benefits the psyche than does the head, which has a rather unhealthy tendeny to lead an \'abstract\' existence, and easily forgets that its consciousness is snuffed out the moment the heart fails its duty.","I am astonished, disappointed, pleased with myself. I am distressed, depressed, rapturous. I am all these things at once, and cannot add up the sum.","you are boys, your God is a woman. If you are women, your God is a boy. If you are men, your God is a maiden. The God is where you are not. So: it is wise that one has a God; this serves for your perfection. A maiden is the pregnant future. A boy is the engendering future. A woman is: having given birth. A man is: having engendered.","Even a happy life cannot be without a measure of darkness, and the word \u2018happy\u2019 would lose its meaning if it were not balanced by sadness.","We want to have certainties and no doubts--results and no experiments--without even seeing that certainties can arise only through doubt and results only through experiment.","No one should deny the danger of the descent, but it can be risked. No one need risk it, but it is certain that someone will. And let those who go down the sunset way do so with open eyes, for it is a sacrifice which daunts even the gods. Yet every descent is followed by an ascent; the vanishing shapes are shaped anew, and a truth is valid in the end only if it suffers change and bears new witness in new images, in new tongues, like a new wine that is put into new bottles.","This experience punctured the desired hole in her rationalism and broke the ice of her intellectual resistance.","The unconscious is not a demoniacal monster, but a natural entity which, as far as moral sense, aesthetic taste, and intellectual judgement go, is completely neutral. It only becomes dangerous when our conscious attitude to it is hopelessly wrong. To the degree that we repress it, its danger increases. But the moment the patient begins to assimilate contents that were previously unconscious, its danger diminishes. The dissociation of personality, the anxious division of the day-time and the night-time sides of the psyche, cease with progressive assimilation.","All the corpses in the world are chemically identical, but living individuals are not.","they determine you without you understanding their language.53 One would like to learn this language, but who can teach and learn it? Scholarliness alone is not enough; there is a knowledge of the heart that gives deeper insight.54 The knowledge of the heart is in no book and is not to be found in the mouth of any teacher, but grows out of you like the green seed from the dark earth. Scholarliness belongs to the spirit of this time, but this spirit in no way grasps the dream, since the soul is everywhere that scholarly knowledge is not. But how can I attain the knowledge of the heart? You can attain this knowledge only by living your life to the full. You live your life fully if you also live what you have never yet lived, but have left for others to live or to think.55 You will say: \u201cBut I cannot live or think everything that others live or think. But you should say: \u201cThe life that I could still live, I should live, and the thoughts that I could still think, I should think.\u201d It appears as\u201d","The fact is that each person has to do something different, something that is uniquely his own.","The shadow can be realized only through a relation to a partner, and anima and animus only through a relation to a partner of the opposite sex, because only in such a relation do their projections become operative.","To cherish secrets and to restrain emotions are psychic misdemeanours for which nature finally visits us with sickness\u2014that is, when we do these things in private. But when they are done in communion with others they satisfy nature and may even count as useful virtues. It is only restraint practised in and for oneself that is unwholesome. It is as if man had an inalienable right to behold all that is dark, imperfect, stupid and guilty in his fellow-beings\u2014for such of course are the things that we keep private to protect ourselves. It seems to be a sin in the eyes of nature to hide our insufficiency\u2014just as much as to live entirely on our inferior side. There appears to be a conscience in mankind which severely punishes the man who does not somehow and at some time, at whatever cost to his pride, cease to defend and assert himself, and instead confess himself fallible and human. Until he can do this, an impenetrable wall shuts him out from the living experience of feeling himself a man among men. Here we find a key to the great significance of true, unstereotyped confession\u2014a significance known in all the initiation and mystery cults of the ancient world, as is shown by a saying from the Greek mysteries: \\"Give up what thou hast, and then thou wilt receive.","The essential thing is to differentiate oneself from these unconscious contents by personifying them, and at the same time to bring them into relationship with consciousness. That is the technique for stripping them of their power.","I had always been impressed by the fact that there are a surprising number of individuals who never use their minds if they can avoid it, and an equal number who do use their minds, but in an amazingly stupid way. I was also surprised to find many intelligent and wide-awake people who lived (as far as one could make out) as if they had never learned to use their sense organs: They did not see the things before their eyes, hear the words sounding in their ears, or notice the things they touched or tasted. Some lived without being aware of the state of their own bodies. There are others who seemed to live in a most curious condition of consciousness, as if the state they had arrived at today were final, with no possibility of change, or as if the world and the psyche were static and would remain so forever. They seemed devoid of all imagination, and they entirely and exclusively depended upon their sense-perception. Chances and possibilities did not exist in their world, and in \u201ctoday there was no real \u201ctomorrow.\u201d The future was just the repetition of the past.\u201d","That Kierkegaard was a stimulating and pioneering force precisely because of his neurosis is not surprising since he started out with a conception of God that had a peculiar Protestant bias which he shares with a great many Protestants. To such people his problems and his grizzling are entirely acceptable because to them it serves the same purpose as it served him, you can settle everything in the study and need not do it in life. Out there things are apt to get unpleasant. Neurosis does not produce art. It is uncreative and inimical to life. It is failure and bungling. But the moderns mistake morbidity for creative birth\u2014part of the general lunacy of our time. It is, of course, an unanswerable question what an artist would have created if he had not been neurotic.","It is, in fact, one of the most important tasks of psychic hygiene to pay continual attention to the symptomatology of unconscious contents and processes, for the good reason that the conscious mind is always in danger of becoming one-sided,","My speech is imperfect. Not because I want to shine with words, but out of the impossibility of finding those words, I speak in images. With nothing else to express the words from the depths.","There is no rule that is true under all circumstances, for this is the real and not a statistical world. Because the statistical method shows only the average aspects, it creates an artificial and predominantly conceptual picture of reality.","When the alchemist speaks of Mercurius, on the face of it he means quicksilver (mercury), but inwardly he means the world-creating spirit concealed or imprisoned in matter. The dragon is probably the oldest pictoral symbol in alchemy of which we have documentary evidence. It appears as the Ouroboros, the tail-eater, in the Codex Marcianus, which dates from the tenth or eleventh century, together with the legend \u2018the One, the All\u2019. Time and again the alchemists reiterate that the opus proceeds from the one and leads back to the one, that it is a sort of circle like a dragon biting its own tail. For this reason the opus was often called circulare (circular) or else rota (the wheel). Mercurius stands at the beginning and end of the work: he is the prima materia, the caput corvi, the nigredo; as dragon he devours himself and as dragon he dies, to rise again in the lapis. He is the play of colours in the cauda pavonis and the division into the four elements. He is the hermaphrodite that was in the beginning, that splits into the classical brother-sister duality and is reunited in the coniunctio, to appear once again at the end in the radiant form of the lumen novum, the stone. He is metallic yet liquid, matter yet spirit, cold yet fiery, poison and yet healing draught - a symbol uniting all the opposites.","At first we cannot see beyond the path that leads downward to dark and hateful things\u2014but no light or beauty will ever come from the man who cannot bear this sight. Light is always born of darkness, and the sun never yet stood still in heaven to satisfy man\'s longing or to still his fears.","The shoe that fits one person pinches another; there is no recipe for living that suits all cases. Each of us carries his own life-form\u2014an indeterminable form which cannot be superseded by any other.","If man no longer finds any meaning in his life, it makes no difference whether he wastes away under a communist or a capitalist regime. Only if he can use his freedom to create something meaningful is it relevant that he should be free. That is why finding the inner meaning of life is more important to the individual than anything else, and why the process of individuation must be given priority.","The dream gives a true picture of the subjective state, while the conscious mind denies that this state exists, or recognizes it only grudgingly.","In general, emotional ties are very important to human beings. But they still contain projections, and it is essential to withdraw these projections in order to attain to oneself and to objectivity. Emotional relationships are relationships of desire, tainted by coercion and constraint; something is expected from the other person, and that makes him and ourselves unfree. Objective cognition lies hidden behind the attraction of the emotional relationship; it seems to be the central secret. Only through objective cognition is the real coniunctio possible.","To be quite accurate, human nature is simply what it is; it has its dark and its light sides. The sum of all colours is grey - light on a dark background or dark on light.","But I was not my self, confronted with my thoughts. I should also rise up above my thoughts to my own self. My journey goes there, and that is why it leads away from men and events into solitude. Is it solitude, to be with oneself? Solitude is true only when the self is a desert.73 Should I also make a garden out of the desert? Should I people a desolate land? Should I open the airy magic garden of the wilderness? What leads me into the desert, and what am I to do there? Is it a deception that I can no longer trust my thoughts? Only life is true, and only life leads me into the desert, truly not my thinking, that would like to return to thoughts, to men and events, since it feels uncanny in the desert. My soul, what am I to do here? But my soul spoke to me and said, \u201cWait. I heard the cruel word. Torment belongs to the desert.\u201d","Life calls, not for perfection, but for completeness.","If only a world-wide consciousness could arise that all division and fission are due to the splitting of opposites in the psyche, then we should know where to begin.","The image of the world is half the world.","I do not forget that my voice is but one voice, my experience a mere drop in the sea, my knowledge no greater than the visual field in a microscope, my mind\'s eye a mirror that reflects a small concern of the world, and my ideas - a subjective confession.","Let man but accumulate his materials of destruction and the devil within him will soon be unable to resist putting them to their fated use.","This formulation will not please the mass man or the collective believer. For the former the policy of the State is the supreme principle of thought and action. Indeed, this was the purpose for which he was enlightened, and accordingly the mass man grants the individual a right to exist only in so far as he is a function of the State. The believer, on the other hand, while admitting that the State has a moral and factual claim on him, confesses to the belief that not only man but the State that rules him is subject to the overlordship of \u201cGod, and that, in case of doubt, the supreme decision will be made by God and not by the State.\u201d","Words like \u201cSociety and \u201cState\u201d are so concretized that they are almost personified. In the opinion of the man in the street, the \u201cState,\u201d far more than any king in history, is the inexhaustible giver of all good; the \u201cState\u201d is invoked, made responsible, grumbled at, and so on and so forth. Society is elevated to the rank of a supreme ethical principle; indeed, it is even credited with positively creative capacities.\u201d","A story told by the conscious mind has a beginning, a development, and an end, but the same is not true of a dream. Its dimensions in time and space are quite different; to understand it you must examine it from every aspect-just as you may take an unknown object in your hands and turn it over and over until you are familiar with every detail of its shape.","Even the most carefully defined philosophical or mathematical concept, which we are sure does not contain more than we have put into it, is nevertheless more than we assume. It is a psychic event and as such partly unknowable. The very numbers you use in counting are more than you take them to be. They are at the same time mythological elements (for the Pythagoreans, they were even divine); but you are certainly unaware of this when you use numbers for a practical purpose.","My soul spoke to me in a whisper, urgently and alarmingly: \u2018Words, words, do not make too many words. Be silent and listen: have you recognized your madness, and do you admit it? Have you noticed that all your foundations are all completely mired in madness?\u2019 11 (2) Jung\u2019s soul: \u201cThere are hellish webs of words, only words . . . Be tentative with words, value them . . . for you are the first who gets snared in them. For words have meanings. With words you pull up the underworld. Word, the paltriest and the mightiest. In words the emptiness and the fullness flow together. Hence the word is an image of the God.\u201d","Every concept in our conscious mind, in short, has its own psychic associations. While such associations may vary in intensity (according to relative importance of the concept to our whole personality, or according to the other ideas and even complexes to which it is associated in our unconscious), they are capable of changing the \\"normal\\" character of that concept. It may even become something quite different as it drifts below the level of consciousness.These subliminal aspects of everything that happens to us may seem to play very little part in our daily lives. But in dream analysis, where the psychologist is dealing with expressions of the unconscious, they are very relevant, for they are the almost invisible roots of our conscious thoughts. That is why commonplace objects or ideas can assume such powerful psychic significance in a dream that we may awake seriously disturbed, in spite of having dreamed of nothing worse than a locked room or a missed train.The images produced in dreams are much more picturesque and vivid than the concepts and experiences that are their waking counterparts. One of the reasons for this is that, in a dream, such concepts can express their unconscious meaning. In our conscious thoughts, we restrain ourselves within the limits of rational statements-statements that are much less colorful because we have stripped them of most of their psychic associations.","Each is deceived by the sense of finality peculiar to the stage of development at which he stands.","Dreams give information about the secrets of the inner life and reveal to the dreamer hidden factors of his personality. As long as these are undiscovered, they","We must not underestimate the devastating effect of getting lost in the chaos, even if we know that it is the \'sine qua non\' of any regeneration of the spirit and the personality.","Man is much more the victim of his psychic constitution than its inventor.","From the beginning, I had a sense of destiny, as though my life was assigned to me by fate and had to be fulfilled. This gave me an inner security, and, though I could never prove to myself, it proved itself to me. I did not have the certainty, it had me.","The communist world, it may be noted, has one big myth (which we call an illusion, in the vain hope that our superior judgment will make it disappear). It is the time-hallowed archetypal dream of Golden Age (or Paradise) where everything is provided in abundance for everyone, and a great, just and wise chief rules over the human kindergarten. This powerful archetype in its infantile form has gripped them, but it will never disappear from the world at the mere sight of our superior points of view. We even support it by our own childishness, for our Western civilization is in the grip of the same mythology. Unconsciously, we cherish the same prejudices, hopes, and expectations. We too believe in the welfare state, in universal peace, in the equality of man, in his eternal human rights, in justice, truth, and (do not say it too loudly) in the Kingdom of God on Earth.The sad truth is that man\'s real life consists of a complex and inexorable opposites - day and night, birth and death, happiness and misery, good and evil. We are not even sure that one will prevail against the other, that good will overcome evil, or joy defeat pain. Life is a battleground. It always has been, and always will be; and if it were not so, existence would come to an end.","Anything can be settled by an intellect that is not subject to the control of feeling\u2014and yet the intellectual still suffers from a neurosis if feeling is undeveloped.","The conclusion that the myth-makers thought in much the same way as we still think in dreams is almost self-evident. The first attempts at myth-making can, of course, be observed in children, whose games of make-believe often contain historical echoes. But one must certainly put a large question-mark after the assertion that myths spring from the \u201cinfantile psychic life of the race. They are on the contrary the most mature product of that young humanity.\u201d","The man who looks only outside and quails before the big battalions has no resource with which to combat the evidence of his senses and his reason.","Aesthetics by its very nature is applied psychology","companionship thrives only when each individual remembers his individuality and does not identify himself with others.","The psychotherapist must not allow his vision to be coloured by the glasses of pathology; he must never allow himself to forget that the ailing mind is a human mind, and that, for all its ailments, it shares in the whole of the psychic life of man. The psychotherapist must even be able to admit that the ego is ill for the very reason that it is cut off from the whole, and has lost its connection with mankind as well as with the spirit.","After all, there was nothing preposterous and world-shaking in the idea that there might be events which overstepped the limited categories of space, time, and causality. Animals were known to sense beforehand storms and earthquakes. There were dreams which foresaw the death of certain persons, clocks which stopped at the moment of death, glasses which shattered at the critical moment. All these things had been taken for granted in the world of my childhood. And now I was apparently the only person who had ever heard of them. In all earnestness I asked myself what kind of world I had stumbled into. Plainly, the urban world knew nothing about the country world, the real world of mountains, woods and rivers, of animals and \u2018God\u2019s thoughts\u2019 (plants and crystals). I found this explanation comforting. At all events, it bolstered my self-esteem.","It seems to me that I despised you. My joy at finding you again was not genuine.","You do not have an inferior function, it has you.","If a blind man can gradually be helped to see it is not to be expected that he will at once discern new truths with an eagle eye. One must be glad if he sees anything at all, and if he begins to understand what he sees.","Often in the case of these sudden transformations one can prove that an archetype has been at work for a long time in the unconscious, skilfully arranging circumstances that will unavoidably lead to a crisis.","I do not forget that my voice is but one voice, my experience a mere drop in the sea, my knowledge no greater than the visual field in a microscope.","And just as the typical neurotic is unconscious of his shadow side, so the normal individual, like the neurotic, sees his shadow in his neighbour or in the man beyond the great divide.","In contrast to the subjectivism of the conscious mind the unconscious is objective, manifesting itself mainly in the form of contrary feelings, fantasies, emotions, impulses and dreams, none of which one makes oneself but which come upon one objectively. Even","Good does not become better by being exaggerated, but worse, and a small evil becomes a big one through being disregarded and repressed. The Shadow is very much a part of human nature, and it is only at night that no shadows exist.","Is that which science calls the \u201cpsyche not merely a question-mark arbitrarily confined within the skull, but rather a door that opens upon the human world from a world beyond, now and again allowing strange and unseizable potencies to act upon him and to remove him, as if upon the wings of the night, from the level of common humanity to that of a more personal vocation?\u201d","The ideas of the moral order and of God belong to the ineradicable substrate of the human soul.","Wherever the creative power of desire is, there springs the soil\u2019s own seed. But do not forget to wait.","What can a man say about woman, his own opposite? I mean of course something sensible, that is outside the sexual program, free of resentment, illusion, and theory. Where is the man to be found capable of such superiority? Woman always stands just where the man\'s shadow falls, so that he is only too liable to confuse the two. Then, when he tries to repair this misunderstanding, he overvalues her and believes her the most desirable thing in the world.\\"Women In Europe\\" (1927). In CW 10: Civilization in Transition.

A dream never says: \\"You ought\\", or: \\"This is the truth.\\" It presents an image in much the same way as nature allows a plant to grow, and we must draw our own conclusions.

Therefore not after difference,ye think it, must ye strive; but after YOUR OWN BEING. At bottom, therefore, there is only one striving, namely, the striving after your own being.","Generally certain symptoms appear, among them a peculiar use of language: one wants to speak forcefully in order to impress one\'s opponent, so one employs a special, \\"bombastic\\" style full of neologisms which might be described as \\"power-words.\\" This symptom is observable not only in the psychiatric clinic but also among certain modern philosophers, and, above all, whenever anything unworthy of belief has to be insisted on in the teeth of inner resistance: the language swells up, overreaches itself, sprouts grotesque words distinguished only by their needless complexity. The word is charged with the task of achieving what cannot be done by honest means.","We must remember that the rationalistic attitude of the West is not the only possible one and is not all-embracing, but is in many ways a prejudice and a bias that ought perhaps to be corrected.","My intellect would wish for a clear-cut universe with no dim corners, but there are these cobwebs in the cosmos.","In spite of our proud domination of nature, we are still her victims, for we have not even learned to control our nature.","the spirit of the depths teaches me that I am a servant, in fact the servant of a child. This dictum was repugnant to me and I hated it. But I had to recognize and accept that my soul is a child","Jung introduced the idea of synchronicity to strip off the fantasy, magic, and superstition which surround and are provoked by unpredictable, startling, and impressive events that, like these, appear to be connected.","You can hardly say of your soul what sex it is. But if you pay close attention, you will see that the most masculine man has a feminine soul, and the most feminine woman a masculine soul.","His gods and demons have not disappeared at all; they have merely got new names.","My God is a child, so wonder not that the spirit of this time in me is incensed to mockery and scorn.","It is the growth of consciousness which we must thank for the existence of problems; they are the dubious gift of civilization. It is just man\u2019s turning away from instinct\u2014his opposing himself to instinct\u2014that creates consciousness.","Only the man who has outgrown the stages of consciousness belonging to the past, and has amply fulfilled the duties appointed for him by his world, can achieve full consciousness of the present. To do this he must be sound and proficient in the best sense--a man who as achieved as much as other people, and even a little more. It is these qualities which enable him to gain the next highest level of consciousness.","Hidden in our problems is a bit of still undeveloped personality, a precious fragment of the psyche. Without this, we face resignation, bitterness and everything else that is hostile to life.","They do not realize that a myth is dead if it no longer lives and grows. Our myth has become mute, and gives no answers.","Modern physics, having advanced into another world beyond conceivability, cannot dispense with the concept of a space-time continuum. Insofar as psychology penetrates into the unconscious, it probably has no alternative but to acknowledge the \u201cindistinctness or the impossibility of distinguishing between time and space, as well as their psychic relativity. The world of classical physics has not ceased to exist, and by the same token, the world of consciousness has not lost its validity against the unconscious\u2026 \u201cCausality\u201d is a psychologem (and originally a magic virtus) that formulates the connection between events and illustrates them as cause and effect. Another (incommensurable) approach that does the same thing in a different way is synchronicity. Both are identical in the higher sense of the term \u201cconnection\u201d or \u201cattachment.\u201d But on the empirical and practical level (i.e., in the real world), they are incommensurable and antithetical, like space and time.[\u2026]I would now like to propose that instead of \u201ccausality\u201d we have \u201c(relatively) constant connection through effect,\u201d and instead of synchronicity we have (relatively) constant connection through contingency, equivalence, or \u201cmeaning.\u201d","It is the face of his own evil shadow that grins at Western man from the other side of the Iron curtain.","It is not that present-day man is capable of greater evil than the man of antiquity or the primitive. He merely has incomparably more effective means with which to realize his propensity to evil.","But what a dreary world it would be if the rules were not violated sometimes!","As a doctor I constantly have to ask myself what kind of message the patient is bringing me. What does he mean to me? If he means nothing, I have no point of attack. The doctor is effective only when he himself is affected. \'Only the wounded physician heals.\' But when the doctor wears his personality like a coat of armor, he has no effect.","Acesta este pasul pe care Zarathustra nu l-a putut face: pasul c\u0103tre \u201eomul cel mai ur\xe2t, omul adev\u0103rat. \xcempotrivirea \u015fi frica fa\u0163\u0103 de el dovedesc c\xe2t de mare este puterea de atrac\u0163ie \u015fi de seduc\u0163ie a ceea ce este inferior. Separarea de inferior nu este o solu\u0163ie.\u201d","Every emotional state produces an alteration of consciousness which Janet called abaissement du niveau mental; that is to say there is a certain narrowing of consciousness and a corresponding strengthening of the unconscious which, particularly in the case-of strong affects, is noticeable even to the layman.","Whenever there is a reaching down into innermost experience, into the nucleus of personality, most people are overcome by fear and many run away\u2026.The risk of inner experience, the adventure of the spirit, is in any case alien to most human beings. The possibility that such experience might have psychic reality is anathema to them.","Every Roman was surrounded by slaves. The slave and his psychology flooded ancient Italy, and every Roman became inwardly, and of course unwittingly, a slave. Because living constantly in the atmosphere of slaves, he became infected through the unconscious with their psychology. No one can shield himself from such an influence.","The personality is seldom, in the beginning, what it will be later on. For this reason the possibility of enlarging it exists, at least during the first half of life. The enlargement may be effected through an accretion from without, by new vital contents finding their way into the personality from outside and being assimilated. In this way a considerable increase of personality may be experienced. We therefore tend to assume that this increase comes only from without, thus justifying the prejudice that one becomes a personality by stuffing into oneself as much as possible from outside. But the more assiduously we follow this recipe, and the more stubbornly we believe that all increase has to come from without, the greater becomes our inner poverty. Therefore, if some great idea takes hold of us from outside, we must understand that it takes hold of us only because something in us responds to it and goes out to meet it. Richness of mind consists in mental receptivity, not in the accumulation of possessions. What comes to us from outside, and, for that matter, everything that rises up from within, can only be made our own if we are capable of an inner amplitude equal to that of the incoming content. Real increase of personality means consciousness of an enlargement that flows from inner sources. Without psychic depth we can never be adequately related to the magnitude of our object. It has therefore been said quite truly that a man grows with the greatness of his task. But he must have within himself the capacity to grow; otherwise even the most difficult task is of no benefit to him. More likely he will be shattered by it\u2026","For we are all in some way or other kept asunder by our secrets; and instead of seeking through confession to bridge the abysses that separate us from one another, we choose the easy by-way of deceptive opinions and illusions.","For underlying all philosophies and all religions are the facts of the human soul, which may ultimately be the arbiters of truth and error.","Am I a combination of the lives of these ancestors and do I embody these lives again? Have I lived before in the past as a specific personality, and did I progress so far in that life that I am now able to seek a solution? I do not know. Buddha left the question open, and I like to assume that he himself did not know with certainty. In the meantime it is important to ensure that I do not stand at the end with empty hands.","As understanding deepens, the further removed it becomes from knowledge. An ideal understanding would ultimately result in each party\u2019s unthinkingly going along with the other\u2019s experience \u2013 a state of uncritical passivity coupled with the most complete subjectivity and lack of social responsibility. Understanding carried to such lengths is in any case impossible, for it would require the virtual identification of two different individuals. Sooner or later the relationship reaches a point where one partner feels he is being forced to sacrifice his own individuality so that it may be assimilated by that of the other. This inevitable consequence breaks the understanding, for understanding presupposes the integral preservation of the individuality of both partners","I had to follow the ineradicable foolishness which furnishes the steps to true wisdom.","Myths, however, consist of symbols that were not invented but happened.","There is only one answer to this: the ancients, with a few illustrious exceptions, entirely lacked the capacity to concentrate their interest on the transformations of inanimate matter and to reproduce the natural process artificially, by which means alone they could have gained control of the forces of nature. What they lacked was training in directed thinking.15 The secret of cultural development is the mobility and disposability of psychic energy. Directed thinking, as we know it today, is a more or less modern acquisition which earlier ages lacked.","The goal and meaning of individual life (which is the only real life) no longer lie in individual development but in the policy of the State, which is thrust upon the individual from outside and consists in the execution of an abstract idea which ultimately tends to attract all life to itself.","I must learn the dregs of my thought, my dreams, are the speech of my soul. I must carry them in my heart, and go back and forth over them in my mind, like the words of the person dearest to me. Dreams are the guiding words of the soul. Why should I henceforth not love my dreams and not make their riddling images into objects of my daily consideration? You think that the dream is foolish and ungainly. What is beautiful? What is ungainly? What is clever? What is foolish? The spirit of this time is your measure, but the spirit of the depths surpasses it at both ends.","That you find Kierkegaard \\"frightful\\" has warmed the cockles of my heart. I find him simply insupportable and cannot understand, or rather, I understand only too well, why the theological neurosis of our time has made such a fuss over him. You are quite right when you say that the pathological is never valuable. It does, however, cause us the greatest difficulties and for this reason we learn the most from it.","The spirit of the depths took my understanding and all my knowledge and placed them at the service of the inexplicable and the paradoxical. He robbed me of speech and writing for everything that was not in his service, namely the melting together of sense and nonsense, which produces the supreme meaning.","People go on blithely organizing and believing in the remedy of mass action, without the least consciousness of the fact that the most powerful organizations can be maintained only by the greatest ruthlessness of their leaders and the cheapest of slogans.","But the very fact that this process is unconscious gives us the reason why man has thought of everything except the psyche in his attempts to explain myths. He simply didn\u2019t know that the psyche contains all the images that have ever given rise to myths, and that our unconscious is an acting and suffering subject with an inner drama which primitive man rediscovers, by means of analogy, in the processes of nature both great and small.11 [9]","The animal does not rebel against its own kind. Consider animals: how just they are, how well-behaved, how they keep to the time-honored, how loyal they are to the land that bears them, how they hold to their accustomed routes, how they care for their young, how they go together to pasture, and how they draw one another to the spring. There is not one that conceals its overabundance of prey and lets its brother starve as a result. There is not one that tries to enforce its will on those of its own kind. Not a one mistakenly imagines that it is an elephant when it is a mosquito. The animal lives fittingly and true to the life of its species, neither exceeding nor falling short of it.He who never lives his animal must treat his brother like an animal. Abase yourself and live your animal so that you will be able to treat your brother correctly. You will thus redeem all those roaming dead who strive to feed on the living. And do not turn anything you do into a law, since that is the hubris of power.","Where there is a will there is a way!","Do you believe, man of this time, that laughter is lower than worship? Where is your measure, false measurer? The sum of life decides in laughter and in worship, not your judgment.","But the supreme meaning is the path, the way and the bridge to what is to come. That is the God yet to come. It is not the coming God himself, but his image which appears in the supreme meaning. God is an image, and those who worship him must worship him in the image of the supreme meaning.The supreme meaning is not a meaning and not an absurdity, it is image and force in one, magnificence and force together.The supreme meaning is the beginning and the end. It is the bridge of going across and fulfillment.The other Gods died of their temporality, yet the supreme meaning never dies, it turns into meaning and then into absurdity, and out of the fire and blood of their collision the supreme meaning rises up rejuvenated anew.The image of God has a shadow. The supreme meaning is real and casts a shadow. For what can be actual and corporeal and have no shadow?The shadow is nonsense. It lacks force and has no continued existence through itself. But nonsense is the inseparable and undying brother of the supreme meaning.Like plants, so men also grow, some in light, others in the shadows. There are many who need the shadows and not the light.The image of God throws a shadow that is just as great as itself.The supreme meaning is great and small, it is as wide as the space of the starry Heaven and as narrow as the cell of the living body.","there is good reason for supposing that the archetypes are the unconscious images of the instincts themselves, in other words, that they are patterns of instinctual behaviour.","What happens after death is so glorious that our imagination, our feelings do not suffice to form even an approimate conception of it. Memories and Dreams,Carl Jung","Belief is no adequate substitute for inner experience, and where this is absent even a strong faith which came miraculously as a gift of grace may depart equally miraculously. People","Only boldness can deliver from fear. And if the risk is not taken, the meaning of life is somehow violated, and the whole future is condemned to hopeless staleness.","But we must not forget that only a very few people are artists in life; that the art of life is the most distinguished and rarest of all the arts. Who ever succeeded in draining the whole cup with grace?","There are no problems without consciousness. ..., in what way does consciousness arise? Nobody can say with certainty; but we can observe small children in the process of becoming conscious. Every parent can see ; if they pay attention. And this is what we are able to observe: when the child recognizes someone or something - when [they] \\"know\\" a person or a thing - then we feel that child has consciousness. That, no doubt, is also why in Paradise it was the tree of knowledge which bore such fateful fruit.\\"Carl JungModern Man in Search of a soul1933","Seek the coldness of the moon and ye shall find the heat of the sun.","It is not the universal and the regular that characterize the individual, but rather the unique. He is not to be understood as a recurrent unit but as something unique and singular which in the last analysis can be neither known nor compared with anything else.","Civilized life today demands concentrated, directed conscious functioning, and this entails the risk of a considerable dissociation from the unconscious. The further we are able to remove ourselves from the unconscious through directed functioning, the more readily a powerful counterposition can build up in the unconscious, and when this breaks out it may have disagreeable consequences.","Sometimes you no longer recognize yourself. You want to overcome it, but it overcomes you. You want to set limits, but it compels you to keep going. You want to elude it, but it comes with you. You want to employ it, but you are its tool; you want to think about it, but your thoughts obey it. Finally the fear of the inescapable seizes you, for it comes after you slowly and invincibly. There is no escape. So it is that you come to know what a real God is. Now you\'ll think up clever truisms, preventive measures, secret escape routes, excuses, potions capable of inducing forgetfulness, but it\'s all useless. The fire burns right through you. That which guides forces you onto the way. But the way is my own self, my own life founded upon myself. The God wants my life. He wants to go with me, sit at the table with me, work with me. Above all he wants to be ever present. But I\'m ashamed of my God. I don\'t want to be divine but reasonable. The divine appears to me as irrational craziness. I hate it as an absurd disturbance of my meaningful human activity. It seems an unbecoming sickness which has stolen into the the regular course of my life. Yes, I even find the divine superfluous.~ Red Book, pg. 291","It is a common illusion to believe that what we know today is all we ever can know. Nothing is more vulnerable than scientific theory, which is an ephemeral attempt to explain facts and not an everlasting truth in itself.","there is, after all, no harsher bitterness than that of a person who is his own worst enemy.","The unconscious always tries to produce an impossible situation in order to force the individual to bring out his very best. Otherwise one stops short of one\'s best, one is not complete, one does not realize oneself. What is needed is an impossible situation where one has to renounce one\'s own will and one\'s own wit and do nothing but wait and trust to the impersonal power of growth and development.","Whoever looks from inside knows that everything is new.","The difference between most people and myself is that for me the \\"dividing walls\\" are transparent. That is my peculiarity. Others find these walls so opaque that they see nothing behind them and therefore think nothing is there. To some extent I perceive the processes going on in the background, and that gives me an inner certainty. People who see nothing have no certainties and can draw no conclusions--or do not trust them even if they do. I do not know what started me off perceiving the stream of life. Probably the unconscious itself. Or perhaps my early dreams. They determined my course from the beginning.Knowledge of processes in the background early shaped my relationship to the world. Basically, that relationship was the same in my childhood as it is to this day. As a child I felt myself to be alone, and I am stilI, because I know things and must hint at things which others apparently know nothing of, and for the most part do not want to know. Loneliness does not come from having no people about one, but from being unable to communicate the things that seem important to oneself, or from holding certain views which others find inadmissible. The loneliness began with the experiences of my early dreams, and reached its climax at the time I was working on the unconscious. If a man knows more than others, he becomes lonely. But loneliness is not necessarily inimical to companionship, for no one is more sensitive to companionship than the lonely man, and companionship thrives only when each individual remembers his individuality and does not identify himself with others.","We have let the house our fathers built fall into decay, and now we try to break into Oriental palaces that our fathers never knew. Anyone who has lost the historical symbols and cannot be satisfied with substitutes is certainly in a very difficult position today: before him there yawns the void, and he turns away from it in horror. What is worse, the vacuum gets filled with absurd political and social ideas, which one and all are distinguished by their spiritual bleakness.","Even a happy life cannot be without a measure of darkness, and the word happy would lose its meaning if it were not balanced by sadness. It is far better to take things as they come along with patience and equanimity.","But anyone who really knows the human psyche will agree with me when I say that it is one of the darkest and most mysterious regions of our experience. There is no end to what can be learned in this field.","Often we are led to a wall, it is too high, we cannot get over it and we stand there and stare at it.  Rationalism says, \u201cThere is no getting over it, just go away. Yet natural development has led the patient up to an almost impossible situation to show him that this is the end of his rational solutions.  It is meant that he should get there, and perhaps stay there, make roots and grow like a tree; in time overcome the obstacle, grow over the wall.  There are things in our psychology that cannot be answered today.  You may be up against a stone wall but you should stay there and grow, and in six weeks or a year you have grown over it.  The I Ching expresses that beautifully.  A similar situation which looks quite hopeless is depicted thus: \u201ca goat butts against a hedge and gets its horns entangled.\u201d But in the next line: \u201cThe hedge opens; there is no entanglement/ Power depends upon the axle of a big cart.\u201d So if you could stop butting against the fence you would not get your horns entangles, and presently you would have the power of a cart with four wheels.  There is another way in nature, the way of a tree\u2026The tree stands still and grows and makes roots and eventually overcomes the obstacle. [The Seminars. Volume One, Dream Analysis: Notes of the seminar given in 1928-30. p.249]\u201d","At that time I was still in that childlike state where life consists of single, unrelated experiences.","[R]eal liberation comes not from glossing over or repressing painful states of feeling, but only from experiencing them to the full.\u2026 By accepting the darkness, the patient has not, to be sure, changed it into light, but she has kindled a light that illuminates the darkness within. By day no light is needed, and if you don\u2019t know it is night you won\u2019t light one, nor will any light be lit for you unless you have suffered the horror of darkness.","The necessary and needful reaction from the collective unconscious expresses itself in archetypally formed ideas. The meeting with oneself is, at first, the meeting with one\'s own shadow. The shadow is a tight passage, a narrow door, whose painful constriction no one is spared who goes down to the deep well. But one must learn to know oneself in order to know who one is. For what comes after the door is, surprisingly enough, a boundless expanse full of unprecedented uncertainty, with apparently no one inside and no one outside, no above and no below, no here and no there, no mine and no thine, no good and no bad. It is a world of water, where all life floats in suspension; where the realm of the sympathetic system, the soul of everything living, begins; where I am indivisibly this and that; where I experience the other in myself and the other-than-myself experiences me.No, the collective unconscious is anything but an encapsulated personal system; it is sheer objectivity, as wide as the world and open to all the world. There I am the object of every subject, in complete reversal of my ordinary consciousness, where I am always the subject that has an object. There I am utterly one with the world, so much a part of it that I forget all too easily who I really am. \\"Lost in oneself\\" is a good way of describing this state. But this self is the world, if only a consciousness could see it. That is why we must know who we are.\\"\u2015from_Archetypes of the Collective Unconscious_","That the gods die from time to time is due to man\u2019s sudden discovery that they do not mean anything, that they are made by human hands, useless idols of wood and stone.","The highest truth is one and the same with the absurd.","Real life is always tragic and those who do not know this have never lived.","Anyone who takes the sure road is as good as dead.","Anybody whose calling is to guide souls should have his own soul guided first, so that he knows what it means to deal with the human soul. Knowing your own darkness is the best method for dealing with the darkness of other people. It would not help you very much to study books only, though it is indispensible too. But it would help you most to have a personal insight into the secrets of the human soul. Otherwise everything remains a clever intellectual trick, consisting of empty words and leading to empty talk.","I thought and spoke much of the soul. I knew many learned words for her, I had judged her and turned her into a scientific object. I I did not consider that my soul cannot be the object of my judgment and knowledge; much more are my judgment and knowledge the objects of my soul. Therefore the spirit of the depths forced me to speak to my soul, to call upon her as a living and self-existing being. I had to become aware that I had lost my soul.From this we learn how the spirit of the depths considers the soul: he sees her as a living and self-existing being, and with this he contradicts the spirit of this time for whom the soul is a thing dependent on man, which lets herself be judged and arranged, and whose circumference we can grasp. I had to accept that what I had previously called my soul was not at all my soul, but a dead system. Hence I had to speak to my soul as to something far off and unknown, which did not exist through me, but through whom I existed.","The most frequent manifestations of the anima takes the form of erotic fantasy. Men may be driven to nurse their fantasies by looking at films and strip-tease shows, or by day-dreaming over pornographic material. This is a crude, primitive aspect of the anima, which becomes compulsive only when a man does not sufficiently cultivate his feeling relationships-when his feeling attitude toward life has remained infantile.","Arab culture had struck me with overwhelming force. The emotional nature of these unreflective people who are so much closer to life than we are","teachings about the \\"infantile-perverse-criminal\\" unconscious have led people to make a dangerous monster out of the unconscious, that really very natural thing. As if all that is good, reasonable, beautiful and worth living for had taken up its abode in consciousness!","Our past thinking has determined our present status, and our present thinking will determine our future status; for man is what man thinks.","Our age has shifted all emphasis to the here and now, and thus brought about a daemonization of man and his world. The phenomenon of dictators and all the misery they have wrought springs from the fact that man has been robbed of transcendence by the shortsightedness of the super-intellectuals. Like them, he has fallen a victim to unconsciousness. But man\u2019s task is the exact opposite: to become conscious of the contents that press upward from the unconscious. Neither should he persist in his unconsciousness, nor remain identical with the unconscious elements of his being, thus evading his destiny, which is to create more and more consciousness. As far as we can discern, the sole purpose of human existence is to kindle a light in the darkness of mere being. It may even be assumed that just as the unconscious affects us, so the increase in our consciousness affects the unconscious.","We do not base botany upon the old-fashioned division into useful and useless plants, or our zoology upon the naive distinction between harmless and dangerous animals. But we still complacently assume that consciousness is sense and the unconsciousness is nonsense. In science such an assumption would be laughed out of court. Do microbes, for instance, make sense or nonsense?Whatever the unconscious may be, it is a natural phenomenon producing symbols that prove to be meaningful. We cannot expect someone who has never looked through a microscope to be an authority on microbes; in the same way, no one who has not made a serious study of natural symbols can be considered a competent judge in this matter. But the general undervaluation of the human soul is so great that neither the great religions nor the philosophies nor scientific rationalism have been willing to look at it twice.","I am astonished, disappointed, pleased with myself. I am distressed, depressed, rapturous. I am all these things at once, and cannot add up the sum.

This task is so exacting, and its fulfilment so profitable, that he forgets himself in the process, losing sight of his instinctual nature and putting his own conception of himself in place of his real being.","But again and again I note that the individuation process is confused with the coming of the ego into consciousness and that the ego is in consequence identified with the self, which naturally produces a hopeless conceptual muddle.","\u06cc\u06a9 \u0627\u0646\u0633\u0627\u0646 \u06a9\u0627\u0645\u0644 \u0627\u0646\u0633\u0627\u0646\u06cc\u0633\u062a \u06a9\u0647 \u0627\u0632 \u0647\u0631 \u062f\u0648 \u0648\u062c\u0647 \u0632\u0646\u0627\u0646\u06af\u06cc \u0648 \u0645\u0631\u062f\u0627\u0646\u06af\u06cc \u0631\u0648\u062d\u0634 \u0628\u0647\u0631\u0647 \u0645\u06cc\u0628\u0631\u062f... \u0627\u06af\u0631 \u0642\u0631\u0627\u0631 \u0627\u0633\u062a \u062c\u0627\u06cc\u06cc \u0639\u0634\u0642 \u0628\u0648\u0631\u0632\u06cc\u0645... \u0627\u06af\u0631 \u0642\u0631\u0627\u0631 \u0627\u0633\u062a \u062c\u0627\u06cc\u06cc \u0645\u062d\u06a9\u0645 \u0648 \u0627\u0633\u062a\u0648\u0627\u0631 \u0628\u0627\u0634\u06cc\u0645... \u0627\u06af\u0631 \u0642\u0631\u0627\u0631 \u0627\u0633\u062a \u06cc\u06a9 \u0628\u062d\u0631\u0627\u0646 \u0631\u0648\u062d\u06cc \u0631\u0627 \u0628\u0647 \u0633\u062e\u062a\u06cc \u0637\u06cc \u06a9\u0646\u06cc\u0645... \u0627\u06af\u0631 \u0642\u0631\u0627\u0631 \u0627\u0633\u062a \u062c\u0627\u0647\u0627\u06cc\u06cc \u0632\u06cc\u0628\u0627 \u067e\u0633\u0646\u062f \u0648 \u062d\u0633\u0627\u0633 \u0628\u0627\u0634\u06cc\u0645...\u0648 \u062f\u0631 \u0647\u0645\u0647 \u06cc \u0645\u0648\u0642\u0639\u06cc\u062a \u0647\u0627 \u0646\u06af\u0627\u0647 \u0646\u06a9\u0646\u06cc\u0645 \u0632\u0646 \u0647\u0633\u062a\u06cc\u0645 \u06cc\u0627 \u0645\u0631\u062f.. \u0622\u0646\u0686\u0647 \u0631\u0648\u062d\u0645\u0627\u0646 \u062a\u0634\u0646\u0647 \u06cc \u0627\u0648\u0633\u062a \u0631\u0627 \u0628\u0628\u06cc\u0646\u06cc\u0645 \u0648 \u062d\u0633 \u06a9\u0646\u06cc\u0645 \u0648 \u0627\u0646\u062c\u0627\u0645 \u062f\u0647\u06cc\u0645.","Certainly this is an animated world, a world of the simplest things.

I have already pointed out the existence among primitive peoples of what anthropologists call \u201cmisoneism, a deep and superstitious fear of novelty. The primitives manifest all the reactions of the wild animal against untoward events. But \u201ccivilized\u201d man reacts to new ideas in much the same way, erecting psychological barriers to protect himself from the shock of facing something new.\u201d","It is in the nature of political bodies always to see the evil in the opposite group, just as the individual has an ineradicable tendency to get rid of everything he does not know and does not want to know about himself by foisting it off on somebody else.","Modern man does not understand how much his \u201crationalism (which has destroyed his capacity to respond to numinous symbols and ideas) has put him at the mercy of the psychic \u201cunderworld.\u201d He has freed himself from \u201csuperstition\u201d (or so he believes), but in the process he has lost his spiritual values to a positively dangerous degree. His moral and spiritual tradition has disintegrated, and he is now paying the price for this break-up in worldwide disorientation and dissociation. Anthropologists\u201d","Crimes the individual alone could never stand are freely committed by the group.","It may seem that my discussion of synchronicity has led me away from my main theme, but I feel it is necessary to make at least a brief introductory reference to it because it is a Jungian hypothesis that seems to be pregnant with future possibilities of investigation and application. Synchronistic events, moreover, almost invariably accompany the crucial phases of the process of individuation. But too often they pass unnoticed, because the individual has not learned to watch for such coincidences and to make them meaningful in relation to the symbolism o f his dreams.","whenever the emotion had reached its climax, suddenly it swung around and there followed a cosmic stillness. At such times I was remote from everything, and what had only a moment before excited me seemed to belong to a distant past.","Where the many are, there is security; what the many believe must of course be true; what the many want must be worth striving for, and necessary, and therefore good.","Outward circumstances are no substitute for inner experience","We all feel that the opposite of our own highest principle must be purely destructive, deadly, and evil. We refuse to endow it with any positive life-force; hence we avoid and fear it.","We all say that this is the century of the common man, that he is the lord of the earth, the air and the water, and that on his decision hangs the historical fate of the nations. This proud picture of human grandeur is unfortunately an illusion only and is counterbalanced by a reality which is very different. In this reality man is the slave and victim of the machines that have conquered space and time for him; he is intimidated and endangered by the might of the war technique which is supposed to safeguard his physical existence; his spiritual and moral freedom, though guaranteed within limits in one half of his world, is threatened with chaotic disorientation, and in the other half it is abolished altogether. Finally, to add comedy to tragedy, this lord of the elements, this universal arbiter, hugs to his bosom notions which stamp his dignity as worthless and turn his autonomy into an absurdity. All his achievements and possessions do not make him bigger; on the contrary, they diminish him, as the fate of the factory worker under the rule of a \u2018just\u2019 distribution of goods clearly demonstrates.","Consciousness is a precondition of being.","It even seems as if the ego has not been produced by nature to follow its own arbitrary impulses to an unlimited extent, but to help to make real the totality-the whole psyche. It is the ego that serves to light up the entire system, allowing it to become conscious and thus to be realized. If, for example, I have an artistic talent of which my ego is not conscious, nothing will happen to it. The gift may as well be non-existent. Only if my ego notices it can I bring it into reality. The inborn but hidden totality of the psyche is not the same thing as a wholeness that is fully realized and lived.One could picture this in the following way: The seed of a mountain pine contains the whole future tree in a latent form; but each seed falls at a certain time onto a particular place, in which there are a number of special factors, such as the quality of the soil and the stones, the slope of the land, and its exposure to the sun and wind. The latent totality of the pine in the seed reacts to these cicumstances by avoiding the stones and inclining toward the sun, with the result that the tree\'s growth is shaped. Thus an individual pine slowly comes into existence, constituting the fulfillment of its totality, its emergence into the realm of reality. Without the living tree, the image of the pine is only a possibility or an abstract idea. Again, the realization of this uniqueness in the individual man is the goal of the process of individuation.","Is there always under the glory of white wings and graceful speed, the scaffolding of a cross?If you meet a woman who sails her life with strength and grace and assurance, talk to her. What you will find is that there has been a suffering, that at some time she has left herself for (hanging) dead.We are so busy doing and achieving that we have lost touch with our inner life \u2013 that life that gives meaning to symbols and conversely the symbols that give meaning to life.","Thereforeonyourjourneybesuretotakegoldencupsfull of the sweet drink oflife, red wine, and give it to dead matter, so that it can win life back The dead matter will change into black serpents. Do not be frightened, the serpents will immediately put out the sun of your days, and a night with wonderful will-o\'-the-wisps will come over YOU. 140Take pains to waken the dead. Dig deep mines and throw in sacrificial gifts, so that they reach the dead. Reflect in good heart upon evil, this is the way to the ascent. But before the ascent, everything is night and Hell.. What do you think of the essence of Hell? Hell is when the depths come to you with all that you no longer are or are not yet capable of Hell is when you can no longer attain what you could attain. Hell is when you must thinlc and feel and do everything that you know you do not want. Hell is when you know that your havingtoisalsoawantingto,andthatyouyourselfareresponsible for it. Hell is when you know that everything serious that you have planned with yourself is also laughable, that everything fineis also brutal, that everything good is also bad, that everything high is also low, and that everything pleasant is also shameful.But the deepest Hell is when you realize that Hell is also no Hell, but a cheerful Heaven, not a Heaven in itself, but in this respect a Heaven, and in that respect a Hell.That is the ambiguity of the God: he is born from a dark ambiguity and rises to a bright ambiguity. Unequivocalness is simplicityandleadstodeath.141Butambiguityisthewayoflife.142 If the left foot does not move, then the right one does, and you move. The God wills this.143You say: the Christian God is unequivocal, he is 10ve.l44 But what is more ambiguous than love? Love is the way of life, but your love is only on the way oflife ifyou have a left and a right.Nothing is easier than to play at ambiguity and nothing is more difficult than living ambiguity. He who plays is a child; his God is old and dies. He who lives is awakened; his God is young and goes on. He who plays hides from the inner death. He who lives feels the going onward and immortality. So leave the play to the players. Let fall what wants to fall; if you stop it, it will sweep you away. There is a true love that does not concern itself with neighbors.","Unfortunately, there is no doubt about the fact that man is, as a whole, less good than he imagines himself or wants to be. Everyone carries a shadow, and the less it is embodied in the individual\u2019s conscious life, the blacker and denser it is.","Selfish desire ultimately desires itself You find yourselfin your desire, so do not say that desire is vain.

Selfish desire only\\" apparently led you to men, but in reality it led you away from them and in the end to yoursel\xa3 which to you and to others was the most remote.

You will see how little capable you are of imitating the heroes and ofbeing a hero yourself So you will also no longer force others to become heroes.

The 18th-century German mathematician Karl Friedrich Gauss gives an example of an experience of such an unconscious order of ideas: He says that he found a certain rule in the theory of numbers \\"not by painstaking research, but by the Grace of God, so to speak. The riddle solved itself as lightning strikes, and I myself could not tell or show the connection between what I knew before, what I last used to experiment with, and what produced the final success.\\" The French scientist Henri Poincare is even more explicit about this phenomenon; he describes how during a sleepless night he actually watched his mathematical representations colliding in him until some of them \\"found a more stable connection. One feels as if one could watch one\'s own unconscious at work, the unconscious activity partially becoming manifest to consciousness without losing its own character. At such moments one has an intuition of the difference between the mechanisms of the two egos.","it seemed to me I was living in an insane asylum of my own making. I went about with all these fantastic figures: centaurs, nymphs, satyrs, gods and goddesses, as though they were patients and I was analyzing them.

The individual who is not anchored in God can offer no resistance on his own resources to the physical and moral blandishments of the world. For this he needs the evidence of inner, transcendent experience which alone can protect him from the otherwise inevitable submersion in the mass.","To the extent that a man is untrue to the law of his being and does not rise to personality, he has failed to realize his life\u2019s meaning. Fortunately,","Ethical decision is possible only when one is conscious of the conflict in all its aspects.","You know, it is sometimes an ideal not to have any kind of convictions or feelings that are not based upon reality. One must even educate people...that their emotions ought to have a real basis, that they cannot swear hell and damnation at somebody on a mere assumption, and that there are absolute reasons why they are not justified in doing such a thing. They really have to learn that their feelings should be based on facts.But to [develop further] one should unlearn all that. One should even admit that all one\'s psychical facts have nothing to do with material facts. For instance, the anger which you feel for somebody or something, no matter how justified it is, is not caused by those external things. It is a phenomenon all by itself. That is what we call taking a thing on its subjective level. ...If you have reached that level...you have succeeded in dissolving the absolute union of material external facts with internal or psychical facts. You begin to consider the game of the world as your game, the people that appear outside as exponents of your psychical condition. Whatever befalls you, whatever experience or adventure you have in the external world, is your own experience.","We are so captivated by and entangled in our subjective consciousness that we have forgotten the age-old fact that God speaks chiefly through dreams and visions.","If you are a gifted person, it doesn\'t mean that you gained something. It means you have something to give back.","The communist world, it may be noted, has one big myth (which we call an illusion, in the vain hope that our superior judgment will make it disappear). It is the time-hallowed archetypal dream of a Golden Age (or Paradise), where everything is provided in abundance for everyone, and a great, just, and wise chief rules over a human kindergarten.","[...] the really complex and unfamiliar part of the human mind, from which symbols are produced, is still virtually unexplored. It seems almost incredible that though we receive signals from it every night, deciphering these communications seems too tedious for any but a very few people to be bothered with. Man\'s greatest instrument, his psyche, is little thought of, and it is often directly mistrusted and despised. \\"It\'s only psychological\\" too often means: It is nothing.","But the unconscious is also feared by those whose conscious attitude is at odds with their true nature. Naturally their dreams will then assume an unpleasant and threatening form, for if nature is violated she takes her revenge. In itself the unconscious is neutral, and its normal function is to compensate the conscious position. In it the opposites slumber side by side; they are wrenched apart only by the activity of the conscious mind, and the more one-sided and cramped the conscious standpoint is, the more painful or dangerous will be the unconscious reaction. There","To many death seems to be a brutal and meaningless end to a short and meaningless existence. So it looks, if seen from the surface and from the darkness.But when we penetrate the depths of the soul and when we try to understand its mysterious life, we shall discern that death is not a meaningless end, the mere vanishing into nothingness \u2014 it is an accomplishment, a ripe fruit on the tree of life.Nor is death an abrupt extinction, but a goal that has been unconsciously lived and worked for during half a lifetime.","The shadow is a living part of the personality and therefore wants to live with it in some form. It cannot be argued out of existence or rationalized into harmlessness. This problem is exceedingly difficult, because it not only challenges the whole man, but reminds him at the same time of his helplessness and ineffectuality.","Moderns consider themselves wholly rational, unemotional, scientific, and atheistic. Where earlier humanity had realized its unconscious through religion, moderns dismiss both religion and the unconscious as prescientific delusions. Instead, moderns proudly identify themselves with their ego and thereby boast of their omnipotence: \u201cnowadays most people identify themselves almost exclusively with their consciousness, and imagine that they","The way to truth stands open only to those without intentions.","Numinous experience elevates and humiliates simultaneously.","Practical experience and accurate observation show that one cannot influence one\u2019s own dreams. There are people, it is true, who assert that they can influence them.

But when spirit becomes heavy it turns to water, and with Luciferian presumption the intellect usurps the seat where once the spirit was enthroned. The spirit may legitimately claim the patria potestas over the soul; not so the earth-born intellect, which is man\'s sword or hammer, and not a creator of spiritual worlds, a father of the soul.","The unexpected parallelisms of ideas in psychology and physics suggest, as Jung pointed out, a possible ultimate one-ness of both fields of reality that physics and psychology study-i.e., a psychophysical one-ness of both fields of reality that physics and psychology study-i.e., a psychophysical one-ness of all life phenomena. Jung was even convinced that what he calls the unconscious somehow links up with the structure of inorganic matter-a link to which the problem of so-called \\"psychosomatic\\" illness seems to point. The concept of a unitarian idea of reality (which has been followed up by Pauli and Erich Nuemann) was called by Jung the unus mundus (the one world, within which matter and psyche are not yet discriminated or separately actualized). He paved the way toward such a unitarian point of view by pointing out that an archetype shows a \\"psychoid\\" (i.e., not purely psychic but almost material) aspect when it appears within a synchronistic event-for such an event is in effect a meaningful arrangement of inner psychic and outer facts.","Many people may want some change from a containing pattern of life; but the freedom gained by travel (urged by the \u201crun away to sea poster), is no substitute for a true inner liberation.\u201d","Because there are innumerable things beyond the range of human understanding, we constantly use symbolic terms to represent concepts that we cannot define or fully comprehend. This is one reason why all religions employ symbolic language or images. But this conscious use of symbols is only one aspect of a psychological fact of great importance: Man also produces symbols unconsciously and spontaneously, in the form of dreams.","It is as if the \u201ceyes of the background do the seeing in an impersonal act of perception.\u201d","What is it, in the end, that induces a man to go his own way and to rise out of unconscious identity with the mass as out of a swathing mist? Not necessity, for necessity comes to many, and they all take refuge in convention. Not moral decision, for nine times out of ten we decide for convention likewise.What is it, then, that inexorably tips the scales in favour of the extra-ordinary? It is what is commonly called vocation: an irrational factor that destines a man to emancipate himself from the herd and from it\u2019s well-worn paths. True personality is always a vocation and puts its trust in it as God, despite its being, as the ordinary man would say, only a personal feeling. But vocation acts like a law of God from which there is no escape. The fact that many a man who goes his own way ends in ruin means nothing to one who has a vocation. He must obey his own law, as if it were a daemon whispering to him of new and wonderful paths. Anyone with a vocation hears the voice of the inner man: he is called\u2026. The original meaning of \u201cto have a vocation is \u201cto be addressed by a voice.\u201d The clearest examples of this are to be found in the avowals of the Old Testament prophets. That it is not just a quaint old-fashioned way of speaking is proved by the confessions of historical personalities such as Goethe and Napolean, to mention only two familiar examples, who made no secret of their feeling of vocation.\u201d","School came to bore me. It took up far too much time which I would rather have spent drawing battles and playing with fire.","Unlived life is a destructive, irresistible force that works softly but inexorably.","To Western man, the meaninglessness of a merely static universe is unbearable. He must assume that it has meaning. The Oriental does not need to make this assumption; rather, he himself embodies it. Whereas the Occidental feels the need to complete the meaning of the world, the Oriental strives for the fulfillment of the meaning in man, stripping the world and existence from himself (Buddha). I would say that both are right. Western man seems predominantly extraverted, Eastern man predominantly introverted. The former projects the meaning and considers that it exists in objects; the latter feels the meaning in himself. But the meaning is both within and without.","I began to understand that the goal of psychic development is the self. There is no linear evolution; there is only a circumambulation of the self.","The I Ching insists upon self-knowledge throughout. The method by which this is to be achieved is open to every kind of misuse, and is therefore not for the frivolous-minded and immature; nor is it for intellectualists and rationalists. It is appropriate only for thoughtful and reflective people who like to think about what they do and what happens to them -- a predilection not to be confused with the morbid brooding of the hypochondriac. As I have indicated above, I have no answer to the multitude of problems that arise when we seek to harmonize the oracle of the I Ching with our accepted scientific canons. But needless to say, nothing \\"occult\\" is to be inferred. My position in these matters is pragmatic, and the great disciplines that have taught me the practical usefulness of this viewpoint are psychotherapy and medical psychology. Probably in no other field do we have to reckon with so many unknown quantities, and nowhere else do we become more accustomed to adopting methods that work even though for a long time we may not know why they work. Unexpected cures may arise from questionable therapies and unexpected failures from allegedly reliable methods. In the exploration of the unconscious we come upon very strange things, from which a rationalist turns away with horror, claiming afterward that he did not see anything. The irrational fullness of life has taught me never to discard anything, even when it goes against all our theories (so short-lived at best) or otherwise admits of no immediate explanation. It is of course disquieting, and one is not certain whether the compass is pointing true or not; but security, certitude, and peace do not lead to discoveries.","Naturally, society has an indisputable right to protect itself against arrant subjectivisms, but, in so far as society is itself composed of de-individualized human beings, it is completely at the mercy of ruthless individualists. Let it band together into groups and organizations as much as it likes \u2013 it is just this banding together and the resultant extinction of the individual personality that makes it succumb so readily to a dictator. A million zeros joined together do not, unfortunately, add up to one. Ultimately everything depends on the quality of the individual, but our fatally short-sighted age thinks only in terms of large numbers and mass organizations, though one would think that the world had seen more than enough of what a well-disciplined mob can do in the hand of a single madman. Unfortunately, this realization does not seem to have penetrated very far - and our blindness is extremely dangerous. People go on blithely organizing and believing in the remedy of mass action, without the least consciousness of the fact that the most powerful organizations can be maintained only by the greatest ruthlessness of their leaders and the cheapest of slogans.Curiously enough, the Churches too want to avail themselves of mass action in order to cast out the devil with Beelzebub \u2013 the very Churches whose care is the salvation of the individual soul. They too do not appear to have heard anything of the elementary axiom of mass psychology, that the individual becomes morally and spiritually inferior in the mass, and for this reason they do not burden themselves overmuch with their real task of helping the individual to achieve a metanoia, or rebirth of the spirit \u2013 deo concedente. It is, unfortunately, only too clear that if the individual is not truly regenerated in spirit, society cannot be either, for society is the sum total of individuals in need of redemption. I can therefore see it only as a delusion when the Churches try \u2013 as they apparently do \u2013 to rope the individual into a social organization and reduce him to a condition of diminished responsibility, instead of raising him out of the torpid, mindless mass and making clear to him that he is the one important factor and that the salvation of the world consists in the salvation of the individual soul.","It is, unfortunately, only too clear that if the individual is not truly regenerated in spirit, society cannot be either, for society is the sum total of individuals in need of redemption.

In this way, too, the matter-of-fact and the commonplace come to wear an altered countenance, and can even acquire a new glamour. For it all depends on how we look at things, and not on how they are in themselves. The least of things with a meaning is worth more in life than the greatest of things without it.","Somewhere deep in the background I always knew that I was two persons. One was the son of my parents, who went to school and was less intelligent, attentive, hard-working, decent, and clean than many other boys. The other was grown up\u2014old, in fact\u2014skeptical, mistrustful, remote from the world of men, but close to nature, the earth, the sun, the moon, the weather, all living creatures, and above all close to the night, to dreams, and to whatever \u201cGod worked directly in him.\u201d","The present day shows with appalling clarity how little able people are to let the other man\u2019s argument count, although this capacity is a fundamental and indispensable condition for any human community. Everyone who proposes to come to terms with himself must reckon with this basic problem. For, to the degree that he does not admit the validity of the other person, he denies the \u201cother within himself the right to exist\u2014and vice versa. The capacity for inner dialogue is a touchstone for outer objectivity.\u201d","Culture lies beyond the purpose of nature.","In fact it seems to me as if that alienation which so long separated me from the world has become transferred into my own inner world, and has revealed to me an unexpected unfamiliarity with myself.","In fact, the terrors that stem from our elaborate civilization may be far more threatening than those that primitive people attribute to demons.

Everything else is to be derived from this. It began at that time, and the later details hardly matter anymore. My entire life consisted in elaborating what had burst forth from the unconscious and flooded me like an enigmatic stream and threatened to break me. That was the stuff and material for more than only one life. Everything later was merely the outer classification, the scientific elaboration, and the integration into life. But the numinous beginning, which contained everything, was then.","People will do anything, no matter how absurd, to avoid facing their own souls. They will practice Indian yoga and all its exercises, observe a strict regimen or diet, learn theosophy by heart, or mechanically repeat mystic texts from the literature of the whole world \u2013 all because they cannot get on with themselves and have not the slightest faith that anything useful could ever come out of their souls. \u2026 It is rewarding to watch patiently the silent happenings in the soul, and the most and the best happens when it is not regulated from outside and from above. I readily admit that I have such a great respect for what happens in the human soul that I would be afraid of disturbing and distorting the silent operation of nature by clumsy interference.\xa0\u201d","There are people, of course, who think it unscientific to take anything seriously; they do not want their intellectual playground disturbed by graver considerations. But the doctor who fails to take account of man\'s feelings for values commits a serious blunder, and if he tries to correct the mysterious and well-nigh inscrutable workings of nature with his so-called scientific attitude, he is merely putting his shallow sophistry in place of nature\'s healing processes.","Therefore the individual who wishes to have an answer to the problem of evil, as it is posed today, has need, first and foremost, of self-knowledge, that is, the utmost possible knowledge of his own wholeness. He must know relentlessly how much good he can do, and what crimes he is capable of, and must beware of regarding the one as real and the other as illusion. Both are elements within his nature, and both are bound to come to light in him, should he wish\u2014as he ought\u2014to live without self-deception or self-delusion.","The motto \\"Where there\'s a will, there\'s a way\\" is the superstition of modern man.Yes in order to sustain his creed, contemporary man pays the price in a remarkable lack of introspection. He is blind to the fact that, with all his rationality and efficiency, he is possessed by \\"powers\\" that are beyond his control. His god and demons have not disappeared at all; they have merely got new names. They keep him on the run with restlessness, vague apprehensions, psychological complications, an insatiable need for pills, alcohol, tobacco, food\u2014and, above all, a large array of neuroses.","Suma unui milion de zerouri nu face nici m\u0103car unu.","all the higher grades of science, imagination and intuition play an increasingly important role over and above intellect and its capacity for application.","If your virtues hinder you from salvation, discard them, since they have become evil to you. The slave to virtue finds the way as little as the slave to vices.","The deeper layers\u2019 of the psyche lose their individual uniqueness as they retreat farther and farther into darkness. \u2018Lower down,\u2019 that is to say as they approach the autonomous functional systems, they become increasingly collective until they are universalized and extinguished in the body\u2019s materiality, i.e., in chemical substances.

Hence \u2018at bottom\u2019 the psyche is simply \u2018world.","Dreams are, after all, compensations for the conscious attitude.","Man wird nicht dadurch erleuchtet, da\xdf man sich Lichtgestalten vorstellt, sondern durch Bewusstmachung der Dunkelheit.","Toute passe\u2013yesterday\u2019s truth is to-day\u2019s deception, and yesterday\u2019s false inference may be to-morrow\u2019s revelation.","the intellectual \u201cgrasp of a psychological fact produces no more than a concept of it, and that a concept is no more than a name, a flatus vocis. These intellectual counters can be bandied about easily enough. They pass lightly from hand to hand, for they have no weight or substance. They sound full but are hollow; and though purporting to designate a heavy task and obligation, they commit us to nothing. The intellect is undeniably useful in its own field, but is a great cheat and illusionist outside of it whenever it tries to manipulate values.\u201d","The doctor is effective only when he himself is affected.","No one has any obligations to a concept; that is what is so agreeable about conceptuality\u2014it promises protection from experience.","For every manifest case of insanity there are, in my estimation, at least ten latent cases who seldom get to the point of breaking out openly but whose views and behavior, for all their appearance of normality, are influenced by unconsciously morbid and perverse factors.","theologians are different in this respect, at any rate; at least they are sure that God exists, even though they make contradictory statements about Him.","Another technique developed by Jung was that of \u201cactive imagination. Jung encouraged his patients to enter a state of reverie in which judgment was suspended but consciousness preserved. They were then enjoined to note what fantasies occurred to them, and to let these fantasies go their own way without interference. Jung encouraged his patients to draw and paint their fantasies, finding that this technique both helped the patient to rediscover hidden parts of himself and also portrayed the psychological journey upon which he was embarked. Jung was the first analyst to supplement verbal exchange in this way; and the increasing use of painting, modelling and music in therapy bears witness to Jung\u2019s prescience.\u201d","The world will ask who you are, and if you do not know, the world will tell you.","My thesis, then, is as follows: In addition to our immediate consciousness, which is of a thoroughly personal nature and which we believe to be the only empirical psyche (even if we tack on the personal unconscious as an appendix), there exists a second psychic system of a collective, universal, and impersonal nature which is identical in all individuals.","There is no Archimedean point from which to judge, since the psyche is indistinguishable from its manifestations.

It would certainly show perversity if we tried to explain the lives of our ancestors in terms of their late descendants; and it is just as wrong, in my opinion, to regard the unconscious as a derivative of consciousness. We are nearer the truth if we put it the other way round.","The general function of dreams is to try to restore our psychological balance by producing dream material that re-establishes, in a subtle way, the total psychic equilibrium. This is what I call the complementary (or compensatory) role of dreams in our psychic make-up. It explains why people who have unrealistic ideas or too high an opinion of themselves, or who make grandiose plans out of proportion to their real capacities, have dreams of flying or falling. The dream compensates for the deficiencies of their personalities, and at the same time it warns them of the dangers in their present course. If the warnings of the dream are disregarded, real accidents may take their place. The victim may fall downstairs or may have a motor accident.","The feeling of inner detachment and isolation is not in itself an abnormal phenomenon but is normal in the sense that consciousness has withdrawn from the phenomenal world and got outside time and space.You will find the clearest parallels in Indian philosophy, especially in Yoga.In your case the feeling is reinforced by your psychological studies.The assimilated unconscious apparently disappears in consciousness without trace, but it has the effect of detaching consciousness from its ties to the object.I have described this development in my commentary on the Golden Flower. It is a sort of integration process and an anticipation of consciousness.The cross is an indication of this, since it represents an integration of the 4 (functions).It is perfectly understandable that, when consciousness detaches itself from the object, the feeling arises that one does not know where one stands.Actually one is standing nowhere, because standing has a below and an above.But there one has no below and above at all, because spatiality pertains to the world of the senses, and consciousness possesses spatiality only when it is in participation with that world.It is a not-knowing, which has the same positive character as nirvana in the Buddhist definition, or the wu-wei, not-doing, of the Chinese, which does not mean doing nothing.The profound doubt you seem to be suffering from is quite in order as it simply expresses the detachment of consciousness and the resultant explanation of the objective world as an illusion.","I had a dim premonition that he was inescapably succumbing to his fate. He was lonely and had no friend to talk with. At least I knew no one among our acquaintances whom I would have trusted to say the saving word. Once I heard him praying. He struggled desperately to keep his faith. I was shaken and outraged at once, because I saw how hopelessly he was entrapped by the Church and its theological thinking. They had blocked all avenues by which he might have reached God directly, and then faithlessly abandoned him. Now I understood the deepest meaning of my earlier experience: God Himself had disavowed theology and the Church founded upon it. On the other hand God condoned this theology, as He condoned so much else. It seemed ridiculous to me to suppose that men were responsible for such developments. What were men, anyway? \u201cThey are born dumb and blind as puppies, I thought, \u201cand like all God\u2019s creatures are furnished with the dimmest light, never enough to illuminate the darkness in which they grope.\u201d","The more that consciousness is influenced by prejudices, errors, fantasies, and infantile wishes, the more the already existing gap will widen into a neurotic dissociation and lead to a more or less artificial life far removed from healthy instincts, nature, and truth. The general function of dreams is to try to restore our psychological balance by producing dream material that re-establishes, in a subtle way, the total psychic equilibrium. This is what I call the complementary (or compensatory) role of dreams in our psychic make-up.","A man may be convinced in all good faith that he has no religious ideas, but no one can fall so far away from humanity that he no longer has any dominating representation collective.","So far as we have any information about man, we know that he has always and everywhere been under the influence of dominating ideas. Any one who alleges that he is not can immediately be suspected of having exchanged a known form of belief for a variant which is less known both to himself and to others.","the psychological effect of the statistical world picture: it displaces the individual in favor of anonymous units that pile up into mass formations.","Yet there is so much that fills me: plants,animals, clouds, day and night, and the eternal in man. Themore uncertain I have felt about myself, the more there hasgrown up in me a feeling of kinship with all things. In fact itseems to me as if that alienation which so long separated mefrom the world has become transferred into my own inner world,and has revealed to me an unexpected unfamiliarity with my\xad self.","Our psyche is part of nature, and its enigma is as limitless","Belief is no adequate substitute for inner experience, and where this is absent even a strong faith which came miraculously as a gift of grace may depart equally miraculously. People call faith the true religious experience, but they do not stop to consider that actually it is a secondary phenomenon arising form the fact that something happened to us in the first place which instilled pistis into us \u2014 that is, trust and loyalty.","What, on a lower level, had led to the wildest conflicts and to panicky outbursts of emotion, now looks like a storm in the valley seen from the mountaintop. This does not mean that the storm is robbed of its reality, but instead of being in it one is above it.","But what is passion, what are emotions? There is the source of fire, there is the fullness of energy. A man who is not on fire is nothing: he is ridiculous, he is two-dimensional. He must be on fire even if he does make a fool of himself. A flame must burn somewhere, otherwise no light shines; there is no warmth, nothing.","There are so many indications that one does not know what one sees. Is it the trees or is it the woods?","Slavery and rebellion are inseparable correlates. Hence, rivalry for power and exaggerated distrust pervade the entire organism from top to bottom.","On the contrary, every civilized human being, however high his conscious development, is still an archaic man at the deeper levels of his psyche. Just as the human body connects us with the mammals and displays numerous vestiges of earlier evolutionary stages going back even to the reptilian age, so the human psyche is a product of evolution which, when followed back to its origins, shows countless archaic traits.","Psihopatologia \u015ftie cu suficient\u0103 siguran\u0163\u0103 ce \xeei poate face incon\u015ftientul con\u015ftiin\u0163ei.","If we do not have the depths, how do we have the heights?

As Pauli points out, however, we have at least no a priori reasons for rejecting this possibility. But we must loot at this as a still unanswered and an unexplored problem.","Archetypal images decide the fate of man.","Knowledge of processes in the background early shaped my relationship to the world. Basically, that relationship was the same in my childhood as it is to this day.As a child I felt myself to be alone, and I am still, because I know things and must hint at things which others apparently know nothing of, and for the most part do not want to know.Loneliness does not come from having no people about one, but from being unable to communicate the things that seem important to oneself, or from holding certain views which others find inadmissible. The loneliness began with the experiences of my early dreams, and reached its climax at the time I was working on the unconscious.If a man knows more than others, he becomes lonely.But loneliness is not necessarily inimical to companionship, for no one is more sensitive to companionship than the lonely man, and companionship thrives only when each individual remembers his individuality and does not identify himself with others. \u2013 (Memories Dreams and Reflections, Page 356)\u201d","Sometimes you no longer recognize yourself. You want to overcome it, but it overcomes you. You want to set limits, but it compels you to keep going. You want to elude it, but it comes with you. You want to employ it, but you are its tool; you want to think about it, but your thoughts obey it. Finally the fear of the inescapable seizes you, for it comes after you slowly and invincibly. There is no escape. So it is that you come to know what a real God is. Now you\'ll think up clever truisms, preventive measures, secret escape routes, excuses, potions capable of inducing forgetfulness, but it\'s all useless. The fire burns right through you. That which guides forces you onto the way. But the way is my own self, my own life founded upon myself. The God wants my life. He wants to go with me, sit at the table with me, work with me. Above all he wants to be ever present. But I\'m ashamed of my God. I don\'t want to be divine but reasonable. The divine appears to me as irrational craziness. I hate it as an absurd disturbance of my meaningful human activity. It seems an unbecoming sickness which has stolen into the the regular course of my life. Yes, I even find the divine superfluous.","One cannot individuate as long as one is playing a role to oneself; the convictions one has about oneself are the most subtle form of persona and the most subtle obstacle against any true individuation. One can admit practically anything, yet somewhere one retains the idea that one is nevertheless so-and-so, and this is always a sort of final argument which counts apparently as a plus; yet it functions as an influence against true individuation.","The psyche\u2019s attachment to the brain, i.e., its space-time limitation, is no longer as self-evident and incontrovertible as we have hitherto been led to believe. \u2026 It is not only permissible to doubt the absolute validity of space-time perception; it is, in view of the available facts, even imperative to do so.","See, how cruel the whites are: their lips are thin, their noses sharp, their faces furrowed and distorted by holes. Their eyes have a staring expression. They are always seeking something. What are they seeking? The whites always want something, they are always uneasy and restless. We do not know what they want, we do not understand them, we think that they are mad. I asked him why he thought the whites were all mad. \u201cThey say they think with their heads,\u201d he replied.\u201cWhy, of course.

The Summa52 lies before you like a book, and an unspeakable greed seizes you to devour it. Consequently you lean back and stiffen and sit for a long time. You are completely incapable of grasping it. Here and there a light flickers, here and there a fruit falls from high trees which you can grasp, here and there your foot strikes gold. But what is it, ifyou compare it with the totality, which lies spread out tangibly close to you? You stretch out your hand, but it remains hanging in invisible webs. You want to see it exactly as it is but something cloudy and opaque pushes itself exactly in between. You would like to tear a piece out of it; it is smooth and impenetrable like polished steel. So you sink back against the wall, and when you have crawled through all the glow- ing hot crucibles of the Hell of doubt, you sit once more and leanback, and look at the wonder of the Summa that lies spread out before you. Here and there a light flickers, here and there a fruit falls. For you it is all too little. But you begin to be satisfied with yourself, and you pay no attention to the years passing away. What are years? What is hurrying time to him that sits under a tree? Your time passes like a breath of air and you wait for the next light, the next fruit.The writing lies before you and always says the same, if you believe in words. But if you believe in things in whose places only words stand, you never come to the end. And yet you must go an endless road, since life flows not only down a finite path but also an infinite one. But the unbounded makes you53 anxious since the unbounded is fearful and your humanity rebels against it. Consequently you seek limits and restraints so that you do not lose yoursel\xa3 tumbling into infinity Restraint becomes imperative for you. You cry out for the word which has one meaning and no other, so that you escape boundless ambiguity. The word becomes your God, since it protects you from the countless possibilities of interpretation. The word is protective magic against the daimons of the unending, which tear at your soul and want to scatter you to the winds. You are saved if you can say at last: that is that and only that. You spealc the magic word, and the limitless is finally banished. Because of that men seek and make words.54He who breaks the wall ofwords overthrows Gods and defiles temples. The solitary is a murderer. He murders the people, because he thus thinks and thereby breaks down ancient sacred walls. He calls up the daimons of the boundless. And he sits, leans back, and does not hear the groans of mankind, whom the fearful fiery smoke has seized. And yet you cannot find the new words if you do not shatter the old words. But no one should shatter the old words, unless he finds the new word that is a firm rampart against the limitless and grasps more life in it than in the old word. A new word is a new God for old men. Man remains the same, even if you create a new model of God for him. He remains an imitator. What was word, shall become man. The word created the world and came before the world. It lit up like a light in the darkness, and the darkness did not comprehend it.55 And thus the wordshould become what the darkness can comprehend, since what use is the light if the darkness does not comprehend it? But your darkness should grasp the light.The God of words is cold and dead and shines from afar like the moon, mysteriously and inaccessibly: Let the word return to its / creator, to man, and thus the word will be heightened in man. Man should be light, limits, measure. May he be your fruit, for which you longingly reach. The darkness does not compre- hend the word, but rather man; indeed, it seizes him, since he himself is a piece of the darkness. Not from the word down to man, but from the word up to man: that is what the darkness comprehends. The darkness is your mother; she is dangerous.","Not so very long ago there were medical authorities who did not \\"believe\\" in bacteria and consequently allowed twenty thousand young women to die of easily avoidable puerperal fever in Germany alone.

Era un demon in mine, iar in cele din urma prezenta lui a fost decisiva. Ma domina si mi-o lua inainte, iar cand se intampla sa nu mai tin seama de nimic, era fiindca el ma presa. Nu ma puteam opri niciodata la ceea ce obtinusem deja. Trebuia sa continui sa alerg, pentru a-mi ajunge din urma viziunea. Intrucat, dupa cum e lesne de inteles, contemporanii mei nu puteau percepe viziunea mea, vedeau in mine doar pe cineva care fuge aiurea.Am ofensat multi oameni; caci, indata ce observam ca nu ma intelegeau, pentru mine cazul era incheiat. Trebuia sa merg mai departe. Exceptie facand pacientii mei, n-aveam rabdare cu oamenii. Intotdeauna trebuia sa-mi urmez legea interioara care-mi era impusa si nu-mi lasa libertatea alegerii. Ce-i drept insa, n-o urmam de fiecare data. Cum am putea s-o scoatem la capat fara inconsecvente?Pentru unii oameni eram nemijlocit prezent, in masura in care se aflau in contact cu lumea launtrica; dar apoi se putea intampla ca, brusc, sa nu mai fiu acolo cu ei, dat fiind ca nu mai exista nimic care sa ma lege de ei. Am invatat anevoie ca oamenii continua sa fie prezenti, chiar si atunci cand nu mai au nimic a-mi spune. Multi trezeau in mine sentimentul unei umanitati vii, dar numai cand apareau in cercul magic al psihologiei, devenind vizibili; in clipa urmatoare, cand farul isi indrepta raza in alta directie, nu mai exista nimic. Unii oameni ma puteau interesa in modul cel mai intens, pentru ca, de indata ce ii \\"descifram\\", farmecul sa dispara. Mi-am facut multi dusmani astfel. Dar, ca om creator, esti la discretia demonului, nu esti liber, ci inlantuit si manat de el. \\"... o putere rusinos ne smulge / Inima. / Caci jertfa cere orice e ceresc. / Dar cand un zeu este lasat deoparte, / N-aduce nici un bine.\\" (Holderlin, Imnuri si ode)Lipsa de libertate m-a umplut de tristete.

Mi-esti drag, te iubesc chiar, dar nu pot ramane! Pe moment, este ceva sfasietor. Caci eu insumi sunt victima, nu pot, sa raman. Dar demonul aranjeaza lucrurile astfel incat s-o scoatem la capat, iar binecuvantata inconsecventa are grija ca, in contrast flagrant cu \\"infidelitatea\\" mea, sa pot ramane credincios intr-o masura nebanuita.","\u2026neurosis is\u2026a defence\u2026or an attempt, somewhat dearly paid for, to escape from the inner voice and hence from the vocation\u2026Behind the neurotic perversion is concealed his vocation, his destiny: the growth of personality, the full realization of the life-will that is born with the individual. It is the man without amor fati [love of fate] who is the neurotic; he, truly, has missed his vocation.","Synchronicity could be understood as an ordering system by means of which \u201csimilar things coincide, without there being any apparent cause.\u201d","Now, the fact that Nietzsche, after the chapter about \\"Delights and Passions,\\" arrives at the chapter or the stage of \\"The Pale Criminal\\" is not abnormal in itself, but perfectly normal; for if one follows the path of passion one will surely come to the place where one\'s passion becomes abnormal, asocial or criminal, and that is a quality which is in everybody. Therefore, one says, principiis obsta, resist delights and passions, resist in the beginning before it is too late, don\'t have passions, it is not good taste, it is bad form. The deeper reason is that if one slips too far into such flames, one is sure to land in criminality. But how can you live and have no passion-for then you would escape suffering? Nobody can escape suffering, and to try to escape passion is to try to escape suffering. But as you cannot escape suffering you cannot escape passion; you will suffer from passion either directly or indirectly, and it is much better to suffer directly because indirect suffering has no merit. It is exactly as if nothing has happened. So the indirect suffering in a neurosis has no moral merit. Years lost in neurosis are just lost, without gain. But if you suffer directly and you know for what you suffer, that is never lost. Therefore, Christ said that if you know what you are doing you are blessed, but if you don\'t know you are cursed.? For then it is a neurosis. Jung, C. G.. Nietzsche\'s Zarathustra: Notes of the Seminar given in 1934-1939.

Yet all this does not alter the fact that in childhood we go through a phase when archaic thinking and feeling once more rise up in us, and that all through our lives we possess, side by side with our newly acquired directed and adapted thinking, a fantasy-thinking which corresponds to the antique state of mind. Just as our bodies still retain vestiges of obsolete functions and conditions in many of their organs, so our minds, which have apparently outgrown those archaic impulses, still bear the marks of the evolutionary stages we have traversed, and re-echo the dim bygone in dreams and fantasies.","What about masculinity? Do you know how much femininity man lacks for completeness? Do you know how much masculinity woman lacks for completeness? You seek the feminine in women and the masculine in men. And thus there are always only men and women. But where are people? You, man, should not seek the feminine in women, but seek and recognize it in yourself, as you possess it from the beginning. It pleases you to play at manliness, however, because it travels on a well-worn track. You, woman, should not seek the masculine in men but assume the masculine in yourself, since you possess it from the beginning...","But the rites do not offer this opportunity invariably, or automatically. They relate to particular phases in the life of an individual, or of a group, and unless they are properly understood and translated into a new way of life, the moment can pass. Initiation is, essentially, a process that begins with a rite of submission, followed by a period of containment, and then by a further rite of liberation. In this way every individual can reconcile the conflicting elements of his personality: He can strike a balance that makes him truly human, and truly the master of himself.","Job is no more than the outward occasion for an inward process of dialectic in God. His thunderings at Job so completely miss the point that one cannot help but see how much he is occupied with himself. The tremendous emphasis he lays on his omnipotence and greatness makes no sense in relation to Job, who certainly needs no more convincing, but only becomes intelligible when aimed at a listener who doubts it.","Although our civilized consciousness has separated itself from the instincts, the instincts have not disappeared; they have merely lost their contact with consciousness.","We had forgotten that God is terrible...Christ taught; God is love. But you should know that love is also terrible.","I began to see my parents with different eyes, and to understand their cares and worries. For my father in particular I felt compassion\u2014less, curiously enough, for my mother. She always seemed to me the stronger of the two. Nevertheless I always felt on her side when my father gave vent to his moody irritability. This necessity for taking sides was not exactly favorable to the formation of my character. In order to liberate myself from these conflicts I fell into the role of the superior arbitrator who willy-nilly had to judge his parents. That caused a certain inflatedness in me; my unstable self-assurance was increased and diminished at the same time.","In its individual manifestation the character of a man\'s anima is as a rule shaped by his mother. If he feels that his mother had a negative influence on him, his anima will often express itself in irritable, depressed moods, uncertainty, insecurity, and touchiness. (If, however he is able to overcome the negative assaults on himself, they can serve to reinforce his masculinity.) Within the soul of such a man the negative mother-anima figure will endlessly repeat this theme: \\"I am nothing. Nothing makes any sense. With others it\'s different, but for me...I enjoy nothing.\\" These \\"anima moods\\" cause a sort of dullness, a fear of disease, of impotence, or of accidents. The whole of life takes on a sad and oppressive aspect. Such dark moods can even lure a man to suicide, in which case the anima becomes a death demon. She appears in this role in Cocteau\'s film Orphee.","The predominantly rationalistic European finds much that is human alien to him, and he prides himself on this without realizing that his rationality is won at the expense of his vitality, and that the primitive part of his personality is consequently condemned to a more or less underground existence.","Another way in which the negative anima in a man\'s personality can be revealed is in waspish, poisonous, effeminate remarks by which he devalues everything. Remarks of this sort always contain a cheap twisting of the truth and are in a subtle way destructive. There are legends throughout the world in which \\"a poison damsel\\" (as they call her in the Orient) appears. She is a beautiful creature who has weapons hidden in her body or a secret poison with which she kills her lovers during their first night together. In this guise the anima is as cold and reckless as certain uncanny aspects of nature itself, and in Europe is often expressed to this day by the belief in witches.","Tibetan Book of the Dead","The collective unconscious contains the whole spiritual heritage of mankind\'s evolution born anew in the brain structure.","If you marry the ordered to the chaos you produce the divine child, the supreme meaning beyond meaning and meaninglessness.","If the unconscious can be recognized as a co-determining factor along with consciousness, and if we can live in such a way that conscious and unconscious demands are taken into account as far as possible, then the centre of gravity of the total personality shifts its position. It is then no longer in the ego, which is merely the centre of consciousness, but in the hypothetical point between conscious and unconscious.

The chief symptoms of this possession are blind moods and compulsive entanglements on one side, and on the other cold, unrelated absorption in principles and abstract ideas. The negative aspect of the anima indicates therefore a special form of psychological maladjustment. This is either compensated from the conscious side or else it compensates a consciousness already marked by a contrary (and equally incorrect) attitude. For the negative aspect of the conscious dominant is far from being a \u201cGod-given idea; it is the most egoistic intention of all, which seeks to play an important role and, by wearing some kind of mask, to appear as something favourable (identification with the persona!). The anima corresponding to this attitude is an intriguer who continually aids and abets the ego in its role, while digging in the background the very pits into which the infatuated ego is destined to fall.\u201d","Everything that irritates us about others can lead us to an understanding of ourselves.Who looks outside, dreams; who looks inside, awakes","The living spirit grows and even outgrows its earlier forms of expression; it freely chooses the human beings who proclaim it and in which it lives. This living spirit is eternally renewed and pursues its goal in manifold and inconceivable ways throughout the history of humankind. Measured against it, the names and forms which men have given it mean very little: They are only the changing leaves and blossoms on the stem of the eternal tree.","There is only one way and that is your way. There is only one salvation and that is your salvation...What is to come will be created in you and from you. Hence look into yourself. Do not compare. Do not measure. No other way is like yours...You must fulfill the way that is in you.","The spirit of the depths even taught me to consider Inyaction and my decision as dependent on dreams. Dreams pave the way for life, and they determine you without you understanding their languageY One would like to learn this language, but who can teach and learn it? Scholarliness alone is not enough; there is a knowledge ofthe heart that gives deeper insight.54 The knowledge of the heart is in no book and is not to be found in the mouth ofany teacher, but grows out ofyou like the green seed from the dark earth. Scholarliness to the spirit of this time, but this spirit in no way grasps the dream, since the soul is everywhere that scholarly knowledge is not.But how can I attain the knowledge of the heart? You can attain this knowledge only by living your life to the full. You live your life fully if you also live what you have never yet lived, but have left for others to live or to think.55 You will say: \\"But I cannot live or think everything that others live or thinlc\\" But you should say: \\"The life that I could still live, I should live, and the thoughts that I could still thinl(, I should thinl(.","From a practical angle this factor reveals itself in that an individual who follows his dreams for a considerable time will find that they are often concerned with his relationships with other people. His dreams my warn him against trusting a certain person too much, or he may dream about a favorable and agreeable meeting with someone whom he may previously have never consciously noticed. If a dream does pick up the image of another person for us in some such fashion, there are two possible interpretations. First, the figure may be a projection, which means that the dream-image of this person is a symbol for an inner aspect of the dreamer himself. One dreams, for instance of a dishonest neighbor, but the neighbor is used by the dream as a picture of one\'s own dishonesty. It is the task of dream interpretation to find out in which special areas one\'s own dishonesty comes into play. (This is called dream interpretation on the subjective level.)","The psychic is a phenomenal world in itself, which can be reduced neither to the brain nor to metaphysics.","By not being aware of having a shadow, you declare a part of your personality to be non-existent. Then it enters the kingdom of the non-existent, which swells up and takes on enormous proportions\u2026If you get rid of qualities you don\u2019t like by denying them, you become more and more unaware of what you are, you declare yourself more and more non-existent, and your devils will grow fatter and fatter.","It is with you all the time and demands fulfillment.

You ask, \\"What? Should I also live evil?","Accordingly, we imagine ourselves to be innocuous, reasonable, and humane. We do not think of distrusting our motives or of asking ourselves how the inner man feels about the things we do in the outside world. But actually it is frivolous, superficial, and unreasonable of us, as well as psychically unhygienic, to overlook the reaction and standpoint of the unconscious. One can regard one\u2019s stomach or heart as unimportant and worthy of contempt, but that does not prevent overeating or overexertion from having consequences that affect the whole man. Yet we think that psychic mistakes and their consequences can be got rid of with mere words, for \u2018psychic\u2019 means less than air to most people. All the same, nobody can deny that without the psyche there would be no world at all, and still less a human world. Virtually everything depends on the human psyche and its functions. It should be worthy of all the attention we can give it, especially today, when everyone admits that the weal or woe of the future will be decided neither by the threat of wild animals, nor by natural catastrophes, nor by the danger of world-wide epidemics, but simply and solely by the psychic changes in man. It needs only an almost imperceptible disturbance of equilibrium in a few of our rulers\u2019 heads to plunge the world into blood, fire, and radioactivity. The technical means necessary for this are present on both sides. And certain conscious deliberations, uncontrolled by any inner opponent, can be put into effect all too easily, as we have seen already from the example of one \'Leader.\u2019 The consciousness of modern man still clings so much to external objects that he makes them exclusively responsible, as if it were on them that the decision depended","This is an aspect of the modern \u201ccultural mind that is well worth looking into. It shows an alarming degree of dissociation and psychological confusion.\u201d","Anyone who is destined to descend into a deep pit had better set about it with all the necessary precautions rather than risk falling into the hole backwards.","...what you resist not only persists, but will grow in size.","To think otherwise than our contemporaries think is somehow illegitimate and disturbing; it is even indecent, morbid or blasphemous, and therefore socially dangerous for the individual.

Para lo inconsciente queda, por lo tanto, mucho espacio libre.","The saying, \u201cFor many are called, but few are chosen, applies here as nowhere else; for the development of personality from its germinal state to full consciousness is at once a charism and a curse. Its first result is the conscious and unavoidable separation of the single being from the undifferentiated and unconscious herd. This means isolation, and there is no more comforting word for it. Neither family, nor society, nor position can save him from it\u2026The development of personality is a favor that must be paid for dearly.\u201d","Let us therefore verify what we have said above concerning the truth, beginning with ourselves.","Nobody is immune to a nationwide evil unless he is unshakably convinced of the danger of his own character being tainted by the same evil.","silence surrounds me almost audibly,","God is not dead.

Their rite of passage initially emphasizes their essential passivity, and this is reinforced by the physiological limitation on their autonomy imposed by the menstrual cycle. It has been suggested that the menstrual cycle may actually be the major part of initiation from a woman\'s point of view, since it has the power to awaken the deepest sense of obedience to life\'s creative power over her. Thus she willingly gives herself to her womanly function, much as a man gives himself to his assigned role in the community life of his group.","\u2026only one who has risked the fight with the dragon and is not overcome by it wins the hoard, the \u201ctreasure hard to attain. He alone has a genuine claim to self-confidence, for he has faced the dark ground of his self and thereby has gained himself. This experience gives some faith and trust\u2026in the ability of the self to sustain him, for everything that menaced him from inside he has made his own. He has acquired the right to believe that he will be able to overcome all future threats by the same means. He has arrived at an inner certainty which makes him capable of self-reliance.\u201d","My soul, where are you? Do you hear me? I speak, I call you\u2014are you there? I have returned, I am here again. I have shaken the dust of all the lands from my feet, and I have come to you, I am with you. After long years of long wandering, I have come to you again. Should I tell you everything I have seen, experienced, and drunk in? Or do you not want to hear about all the noise of life and the world? But one thing you must know: the one thing I have learned is that one must live this life. This life is the way, the long sought-after way to the unfathomable, which we call divine. There is no other way, all other ways are false paths.","what am I to do there? Is it a deception that I can no longer trust my thoughts? Only life is true, and only life leads me into the desert, truly not my thinking, that would like to return to thoughts, to men and events, since it feels uncanny in the desert.","what am I to do here?","Blind acceptance never leads to a solution; at best it leads only to a standstill and is paid for heavily in the next generation.","I never think that I am the one who must see to it that cherries grow on stalks","The energic value of a cause is never abolished by positing an arbitrary and rational goal: that is always a makeshift.","Our life is like the course of the sun. In the morning it gains continually in strength until it reaches the zenith-heat of high noon. Then comes the enantiodromia: the steady forward movement no longer denotes an increase, but a decrease, in strength. Thus our task in handling a young person is different from the task of handling an older person. In the former case, it is enough to clear away all the obstacles that hinder expansion and ascent; in the latter, we must nurture everything that assists the descent. An inexperienced youth thinks one can let the old people go, because not much more can happen to them anyway: they have their lives behind them and are no better than petrified pillars of the past. But it is a great mistake to suppose that the meaning of life is exhausted with the period of youth and expansion; that, for example, a woman who has passed the menopause is \u201cfinished. The afternoon of life is just as full of meaning as the morning; only, its meaning and purpose are different.14 Man has two aims: the first is the natural aim, the begetting of children and the business of protecting the brood; to this belongs the acquisition of money and social position. When this aim has been reached a new phase begins: the cultural aim. For the attainment of the former we have the help of nature and, on top of that, education; for the attainment of the latter, little or nothing helps. Often, indeed, a false ambition survives, in that an old man wants to be a youth again, or at least feels he must behave like one, although in his heart he can no longer make believe. This is what makes the transition from the natural to the cultural phase so terribly difficult and bitter for many people; they cling to the illusion of youth or to their children, hoping to salvage in this way a last little scrap of youth. One sees it especially in mothers, who find their sole meaning in their children and imagine they will sink into a bottomless void when they have to give them up. No wonder that many bad neuroses appear at the onset of life\u2019s afternoon. It is a sort of second puberty, another \u201cstorm and stress\u201d period, not infrequently accompanied by tempests of passion\u2014the \u201cdangerous age.\u201d But the problems that crop up at this age are no longer to be solved by the old recipes: the hand of this clock cannot be put back. What youth found and must find outside, the man of life\u2019s afternoon must find within himself. Here we face new problems which often cause the doctor no light headache.\u201d","To the scientific mind, such phenomena as symbolic ideas are most irritating, because they cannot be formulated in a way that satisfies our intellect and logic.","Whoever protects himself against what is new and strange and thereby regresses to the past, falls into the same neurotic condition as the man who identifies himself with the new and runs away from the past.","There is a sadness in animals\u2019 eyes, and we never know whether that sadness is bound up with the soul of the animal or is a poignant message which speaks to us out of that still unconscious existence.","Man in the mass sinks unconsciously to an inferior moral and intellectual level, to that level which is always there, below the threshold of consciousness, ready to break forth as soon as it is activated by the formation of a mass....Since nobody is capable of recognizing just where and how much he himself is possessed and unconscious, he simply projects his own condition upon his neighbor, and thus it becomes a sacred duty to have the biggest guns and the most poisonous gas.","I can confirm by a modern dream the element of prognosis (or precognition) that can be found in an old dream quoted by Artemidorus of Daldis, in the second century A.D.: A man dreamed that he saw his father die in the flames of a house on fire. Not long afterward, he himself died in a phlegmone (fire, or high fever), which I presume was pneumonia.","The primitive mentality does not invent myths, it experiences them. Myths are original revelations of the preconscious psyche, involuntary statements about unconscious psychic happenings, and anything but allegories of physical processes.7 Such allegories would be an idle amusement for an unscientific intellect. Myths, on the contrary, have a vital meaning. Not merely do they represent, they are the psychic life of the primitive tribe, which immediately falls to pieces and decays when it loses its mythological heritage, like a man who has lost his soul. A tribe\u2019s mythology is its living religion \u201cwhose loss is always and everywhere, even among the civilized, a moral catastrophe. But religion is a vital link with psychic processes independent of and beyond consciousness, in the dark hinterland of the psyche. Many of these unconscious processes may be indirectly occasioned by consciousness, but never by conscious choice. Others appear to arise spontaneously, that is to say, from no discernible or demonstrable conscious cause","Modern man can\'t see God because he doesn\'t look low enough.","The creative process, so far as we are able to follow it at all, consists in the unconscious activation of an archetypal image, and in elaborating and shaping this image into the finished work. By giving it shape, the artist translates it into the language of the present, and so makes it possible for us to find our way back to the deepest springs of life. Therein lies the social significance of art: it is constantly at work educating the spirit of the age, conjuring up the forms in which the age is most lacking.","There is no good that cannot produce evil and no evil that cannot produce good.","No language exists that cannot be misused. It is hard to realize how badly we are fooled by the abuse of ideas; it even seems as if the unconscious had a way of strangling the physician in the coils of his own theory.","The persona is a complicated system of relations between individual consciousness and society, fittingly enough a kind of mask, designed on the one hand to make a definite impression upon others, and, on the other, to conceal the true nature of the individual.","To think of the moral side, that we should improve the criminal, is nonsense. That is all trash, having nothing to do with justice. It is just to put the criminal to death because we are in his crime too; everyone of us contains a criminal who wants to commit crimes though we don\'t know it. [...] Instead of trying to improve that man, hang him. Our criminal instinct is not satisfied by this damned reasonableness, so we get bitter and poisonous and more and more reasonable, but we are really just waiting for the time when we can take a revolver and kill; we are waiting for an age of revolution, for an age of cruelty. So it would be much better if we could begin at the beginning and put the criminal to death by public execution; it doesn\'t make us any more cruel than we are already. Look at the things that happen in the world! The amount of quite open cruelty is incredible. One reads about in in the papers. Yet we still go on believing that we are growing better and better every day and in every way until we shall arrive in heaven. But we are in hell, and I tell you, if in our most reasonable town we had some juicy shooting, people would feel grand. I saw a policeman a while ago in the country, a perfectly harmless fellow, who said. \\"But just wait till the next time I get at a machine-gun!\\" He promises himself a marvelous feast. And that is so everywhere.Jung, C. G.. Nietzsche\'s Zarathustra: Notes of the Seminar given in 1934-1939. Two Volumes: 1-2, unabridged (Jung Seminars) (p. 466)","In this way he slips imperceptibly into a purely conceptual world where the products of his conscious activity progressively take the place of reality.","Their eyes have a staring expression; they are always seeking something. What are they seeking? The whites always want something; they are always uneasy and restless. We do not know what they want. We do not understand them. We think that they are mad.","The living spirit grows and even outgrows its earlier forms of expression; it freely chooses the men in whom it lives and who proclaim it. This living spirit is eternally renewed and pursues its goal in manifold and inconceivable ways throughout the history of mankind. Measured against it, the names and forms which men have given it mean little enough; they are only the changing leaves and blossoms on the stem of the eternal tree.","The biographies of great artists make it abundantly clear that the creative urge is often so imperious that it battens on their humanity and yokes everything to the service of the work, even at the cost of health and ordinary human happiness. The unborn work in the psyche of the artist is a force of nature that achieves its end either with tyrannical might or with the subtle cunning of nature herself, quite regardless of the personal fate of the man who is its vehicle. The creative urge lives and grows in him like a tree in the earth from which it draws its nourishment.","Relationships must be fostered as far as possible and maintained, and thus a morbid transference can be avoided.","The forlorn state of consciousness in our world is due primarily to loss of instinct, and the reason for this lies in the development of the human mind over the past aeon. The more power man had over nature, the more his knowledge and skill went to his head, and the deeper became his contempt for the merely natural and accidental, for all irrational data\u2014including the objective psyche, which is everything that consciousness is not.","Even a scientist is a human being, and it is quite natural that he, like others, hates the things he cannot explain and thus falls victim to the common illusion that what we know today represents the highest summit of knowledge.","In the end, man is an event which cannot judge itself, but, for better or worse, is left to the judgment of others.","Among these moderns there are of course certain of those denigrating, destructive and perverse natures- unbalanced eccentric- who are never satisfied anywhere, and who therefore flock to every new banner, much to the hurt of these movements and undertakings, in the hope of the finding something fore once which will atone at a low cost for their own insufficiency. It goes without saying that, in my professional work, I have come to know a great many modem men and women, and such pathological pseudo- modems among them. But I prefer to leave these aside.","All these guiding principles in therapy confront the doctor with important ethical duties which can be summed up in the single rule: be the man through whom you wish to influence others.","In the great crises of life, in the supreme moments when to be or not to be is the question, little tricks of suggestion do not help. Then the doctor\u2019s whole being is challenged.","another common peculiarity of hysterics, namely, that of taking everything personally, of never being able to remain objective, and of allowing themselves to be carried away by momentary impressions; this again shows the characteristics of the enhanced object-libido.","A purely causalistic psychology is only able to reduce every human individual to a member of the species Home sapiens, since its range is limited to what is transmitted by heredity or derived from other sources. But a work of art is not transmitted or derived\u2013it is a creative reorganization of those very conditions to which a causalistic psychology must always reduce it.","Be glad that you can recognize [your madness], for you will thus avoid becoming its victim.","Probably, as in all metaphysical questions, both are true: Life is or has meaning and meaninglessness. I cherish the anxious hope that meaning will preponderate and win the battle.","Freud makes his theory of neurosis\u2014so admirably suited to the nature of neurotics\u2014much too dependent on the neurotic ideas from which precisely the patients suffer. This leads to the pretence (which suits the neurotic down to the ground) that the causa efficiens of his neurosis lies in the remote past. In reality the neurosis is manufactured anew every day, with the help of a false attitude that consists in the neurotic\u2019s thinking and feeling as he does and justifying it by his theory of neurosis.","A work of art must relate something that does not appear in its visible form.","Myth is the natural and indispensable intermediate stage between unconscious and conscious cognition.","Whatever piece of unconscious we take and work through brings light to humanity.","If you fulfill the pattern that is peculiar to yourself, you have loved yourself, you have accumulated and have abundance; you bestow virtue then because you have luster.","White men project onto the Negro the primitive drives, the archaic powers, the uncontrolled instincts that they do not want to admit in themselves, of which they are unconscious, and that they therefore designate as the corresponding qualities of other people.","Man is bound to follow the exploits of his scientific and inventive mind and to admire himself for his splendid achievements. At the same time, he cannot help admitting that his genius shows an uncanny tendency to invent things that become more and more dangerous, because they represent better and better means for wholesale suicide. In view of the rapidly increasing avalanche of world population, we have already begun to seek ways and means of keeping the rising flood at bay. But nature may anticipate all our attempts by turning against man his own creative mind, and, by releasing the H-bomb or some equally catastrophic device, put an effective stop to overpopulation. In spite of our proud domination of nature we are still her victims as much as ever and have not even learnt to control our own nature, which slowly and inevitably courts disaster.","I am not altogether pessimistic about neurosis. In many cases we have to say, \u201cThank heaven he could make up his mind to be neurotic. Neurosis is really an attempt at self-cure\u2026It is an attempt of the self-regulating psychic system to restore the balance, in no way different from the function of dreams \u2013 only rather more forceful and drastic.\u201d","If the God is absolute beauty and goodness, how should he encompass the fullness of life, which is beautiful and hateful, good and evil, laughable and serious, human and inhuman? How can man live in the womb of the God if the Godhead himself attends only to one-half of him?","In the name of the multitude he was expressing the fact that Western man is in danger of losing his shadow altogether, of identifying himself with his fictive personality and the world with the abstract picture painted by scientific rationalism. His spiritual and moral opponent, who is just as real as he, no longer dwells in his own breast but beyond the geographical line of division, which no longer represents an outward political barrier but splits off the conscious from the unconscious man more and more menacingly.","Abraham Lincoln has crossed my path, when I was a little boy in school. He was pointed out to the schoolchildren as the model of a citizen, who has devoted his life to the welfare of his country\u2014very much in the same way as those great men \u2013 bene meriti de patria \u2013 of the Roman republic and the Greek polis. Thus Abraham Lincoln has remained since my early days one of the shining stars in the assembly of immortal heroes. Is there greater fame than to be removed to the timeless sphere of mythical existence?","However, we must not forget that it will be some twenty years before the ordinary run of people begin to think the thoughts of the educated person of today.","The image of God has a shadow. The supreme meaning is real and casts a shadow. For what can be actual and corporeal and have no shadows?","One even regrets the loss of such convictions. Since it is a matter of invisible and unknowable things (God is beyond human understanding, and immortality cannot be proved), why should we bother about evidence or truth? Suppose we did not know and understand the need for salt in our food, we would nevertheless profit from its use. Even if we should assume that salt is an illusion of our taste-buds, or a superstition, it would still contribute to our wellbeing. Why, then, should we deprive ourselves of views that prove helpful in crises and give a meaning to our existence? And how do we know that such ideas are not true? Many people would agree with me if I stated flatly that such ideas are illusions. What they fail to realize is that this denial amounts to a \u201cbelief and is just as impossible to prove as a religious assertion\u201d","And it is only the meaningful that sets us free.","I knew that I had to find the answer out of my deepest self,","But a predominantly scientific and technological education, such as is the usual thing nowadays, can also bring about a spiritual regression and a considerable increase of psychic dissociation. With hygiene and prosperity alone a man is still far from health, otherwise the most enlightened and most comfortably off among us would be the healthiest. But in regard to neuroses that is not the case at all, quite the contrary. Loss of roots and lack of tradition neuroticize the masses and prepare them for collective hysteria. Collective hysteria calls for collective therapy, which consists in abolition of liberty and terrorization. Where rationalistic materialism holds sway, states tend to develop less into prisons than into lunatic asylums.","The truth is that poets are human beings, and what a poet has to say about his work is often far from being the most illuminating word on the subject. What is required of us, then, is nothing less than to defend the importance of the visionary experience against the poet himself.","But what will he do when he sees only too clearly why his patient is ill; when he sees that it arises from having no love, only sexuality; no faith, because he is afraid to grope in the dark; no hope, because he is disillusioned by the world and by life; and no understanding, because he has failed to read the meaning of his own existence.","But it is precisely the loss of connection with the past, our uprootedness, which has given rise to the \u201cdiscontents of civilization and to such a flurry and haste that we live more in the future and its chimerical promises of a golden age than in the present, with which our whole evolutionary background has not yet caught up. We rush impetuously into novelty, driven by a mounting sense of insufficiency, dissatisfaction, and restlessness. We no longer live on what we have, but on promises, no longer in the light of the present day, but in the darkness of the future, which, we expect, will at last bring the proper sunrise. We refuse to recognize that everything better is purchased at the price of something worse; that, for example, the hope of greater freedom is canceled out by increased enslavement to the state, not to speak of the terrible perils to which the most brilliant discoveries of science expose us. The less we understand of what our fathers and forefathers sought, the less we understand ourselves, and thus we help with all our might to rob the individual of his roots and his guiding instincts, so that he becomes a particle in the mass, ruled only by what Nietzsche called the spirit of gravity.\u201d","My thoughts are not my self but exactly like the things of the world, alive and dead. Just as I am not damaged through living in a partly chaotic world, so too I am not damaged if I live in my partly chaotic thought world. Thoughts are natural events that you do not possess, and whose meaning you only imperfectly recognize.","Let man but accumulate sufficient engines of destruction and the devil within him will soon be unable to resist putting them to their fated use. It is well known that firearms go off of themselves if only enough of them are together.","The individual is increasingly deprived of the moral decision as to how he should live his own life, and instead is ruled, fed, clothed and educated as a social unit, accommodated in the appropriate housing unit, and amused in accordance with the standards that give pleasure and satisfaction to the masses. The rulers, in their turn, are the undiscovered self just as much social units as the ruled and are distinguished only by the fact that they are specialized mouthpieces of the State doctrine. They do not need to be personalities capable of judgment, but thoroughgoing specialists who are unusable outside their line of business. State policy decides what shall be taught and studied.","[The neurotic] draws back [from his life tasks] not because of any real impossibility but because of an artificial barrier invented by himself\u2026From this moment on he suffers from an internal conflict.

It is an inclination, an emotional tendency that works upon weaker minds, through the unconscious, with an overwhelming force of suggestion that carries them along with it. To think otherwise than our contemporaries think is somehow illegitimate and disturbing; it is even indecent, morbid or blasphemous, and therefore socially dangerous for the individual. He is stupidly swimming against the social current. Just as formerly the assumption was unquestionable that everything that exists takes its rise from the creative will of a God who is spirit, so the nineteenth century discovered the equally unquestionable truth that everything arises from material causes. Today the psyche does not build itself a body, but on the contrary, matter, by chemical action, produces the psyche. This reversal of outlook would be ludicrous if it were not one of the outstanding features of the spirit of the age. It is the popular way of thinking, and therefore it is decent, reasonable, scientific and normal. Mind must be thought to be an epiphenomenon of matter. The same conclusion is reached even if we say not \\"mind\\" but \\"psyche\\", and in place of matter speak of brain, hormones, instincts or drives. To grant the substantiality of the soul or psyche is repugnant to the spirit of the age, for to do so would be heresy.","In the second part of life you begin to question yourself.

His moral and spiritual tradition has disintegrated, and he is now paying the price for this break-up in worldwide disorientation and dissociation.\u201d","More accurately, the ego is in fact supplemented, not replaced, by the self. For the aim of both Gnosticism and therapy is, once again, the integration of ego consciousness with the unconscious, not the rejection of either one for the other: When, in treating a case of neurosis, we try to supplement the inadequate attitude (or adaptedness)","The tomb in which our king is buried is called . . . Saturn*\u201d","Only the wounded physician heals... and then only to the extent he has healed himself.","A sane and normal society is one in which people habitually disagree, because general agreement is relatively rare outside the sphere of instinctive human qualities.","Anthropologists have often described what happens to a primitive society when its spiritual values are exposed to the impact of modern civilization. Its people lose the meaning of their lives, their social organization disintegrates, and they themselves morally decay. We are now in the same condition. But we have never really understood what we have lost, for our spiritual leaders unfortunately were more interested in protecting their institutions than in understanding the mystery that symbols present. In my opinion, faith does not exclude thought (which is man\u2019s strongest weapon), but unfortunately many believers seem to be so afraid of science (and incidentally of psychology) that they turn a blind eye to the numinous psychic powers that forever control man\u2019s fate. We have stripped all things of their mystery and numinosity; nothing is holy any longer.","Those Naskapi who pay attention to their dreams and who try to find their meaning and test their truth can enter into a deeper connection with the Great Man. He favors such people and sends them more and better dreams. Thus the major obligation of an individual Naskapi is to follow the instructions given by his dreams, and then to give permanent form to their contents in art. Lies, and dishonesty drive the Great Man away from one\'s inner realm, whereas generosity and love of one\'s neighbors and of animals attract him and give him life. Dreams give the Naskapi complete ability to find his way in life, not only in the inner world but also in the outer world of nature. They help him to foretell the weather and give him invaluable guidance in his hunting, upon which his life depends. I mention these very primitive people because they are uncontaminated by our civilized ideas and still have natural insight into the essence of what Jung calls the Self.","It is true that widely accepted ideas are never the personal property of their so-called author; on the contrary, he is the bond-servant of his ideas. Although they come into being at a definite time, they are and have always been timeless; they arise from that realm of procreative, psychic life out of which the ephemeral mind of the single human being grows like a plant that blossoms, bears fruit and seed, and then withers and dies. Ideas spring from a source that is not contained within one man\'s personal life. We do not create them; they create us.","In the first case the object works like a magnet upon the tendencies of the subject; it determines the subject to a large extent and even alienates him from himself.","Have you noticed that all your foundations are completely mired in madness?

He drives them away, and they come to themselves\u2014as they should, for they were seeking to rob him of his \u201csacred egoism. This must be left to him, for it is his strongest and healthiest power; it is, as I have said, a true will of God, which sometimes drives him into complete isolation. However wretched this state may be, it also stands him in good stead, for in this way alone can he take his own measure and learn what an invaluable treasure is the love of his fellow-beings. It is, moreover, only in the state of complete abandonment and loneliness that we experience the helpful powers of our own natures.","One consistent experience in all these experiments is the fact that the number of hits scored tends to sink after the first attempt, and the results then become negative. But if, for some inner or outer reason, there is a freshening of interest on the subject\u2019s part, the score rises again. Lack of interest and boredom are negative factors; enthusiasm, positive expectation, hope, and belief in the possibility of ESP make for good results and seem to be the real conditions which determine whether there are going to be any results at all.","The State has taken the place of God; that is why, seen from this angle, the socialist dictatorships are religions and State slavery is a form of worship. But the religious function cannot be dislocated and falsified in this way without giving rise to secret doubts, which are immediately repressed so as to avoid conflict with the prevailing trend towards mass-mindedness. The result, as always in such cases, is overcompensation in the form of fanaticism, which in its turn is used as a weapon for stamping out the least flicker of opposition. Free opinion is stifled and moral decision ruthlessly suppressed, on the plea that the end justifies the means, even the vilest. The policy of the State is exalted to a creed, the leader or party boss becomes a demigod beyond good and evil, and his votaries are honored as heroes, martyrs, apostles, missionaries. There is only one truth and beside it no other. It is sacrosanct and above criticism. Anyone who thinks differently is a heretic, who, as we know from history, is threatened with all manner of unpleasant things. Only the party boss, who holds the political power in his hands, can interpret the State doctrine authentically, and he does so just as suits him.","though you want to flee from yourself so as not to have to live what remains unlived until now.56 But you cannot flee from yourself. It is with you all the time and demands fulfillment. If you pretend to be blind and dumb to this demand, you feign being blind and deaf to yourself. This way you will never reach the knowledge of the heart. The knowledge of your heart is how your heart is. From a cunning heart you will know cunning. From a good heart you will know goodness. So that your understanding becomes perfect, consider that your heart is both good and evil. You ask, \u201cWhat? Should I also live evil? The spirit of the depths demands: \u201cThe life that you could still live, you should live. Well-being decides, not your well-being, not the well-being of the others, but only well-being.\u201d","If we are to do justice to the essence of the thing we call spirit, we should really speak of a \u201chigher consciousness rather than of the unconscious.\u201d","Making them conscious and giving form to what is unformed has a specific effect in cases where the conscious attitude offers an overcrowded unconscious no possible means of expressing itself.","The man with the persona is blind to the existence of inner realities, just as the other [man without a persona] is blind to the reality of the world, which for him has merely the value of an amusing or fantastic playground.","If, for instance, I determine the weight of each stone in a bed of pebbles and get an average weight of five ounces, this tells me very little about the real nature of the pebbles.","The difference between the \u201cnatural individuation process, which runs its course unconsciously, and the one which is consciously realized, is tremendous. In the first case consciousness nowhere intervenes; the end remains as dark as the beginning. In the second case so much darkness comes to light that the personality is permeated with light, and consciousness necessarily gains in scope and insight.\u201d","For it is the function of consciousness not only to recognize and assimilate the external world through the gateway of the senses, but to translate into visible reality the world within us.","All these aspects of the anima have the same tendency that we have observed in the shadow: That is, they can be projected so that they appear to the man to be the qualities of some particular woman. It is the presence of the anima that causes a man to fall suddenly in love when he sees a woman for the first time and knows at once that this is \u201cshe. In this situation, the man feels as if he has known this woman intimately for all time; he falls for her so helplessly that it looks to outsiders like complete madness. Women who are of \u201cfairy-like\u201d character especially attract such anima projections, because men can attribute almost anything to a creature who is so fascinatingly vague, and can thus proceed to weave fantasies around her.\u201d","A natural function which has existed from the beginning, like the religious function, cannot be disposed of with rationalistic and so-called enlightened criticism.","Pogled se ti bo razjasnil \u0161ele, ko se bo\u0161 zazrl v svoje srce.

All the corpses in the world are chemically identical, but living individuals are not. Archetypes come to life only when one patiently tries to discover why and in what fashion they are meaningful to a living individual.","While Freud is an investigator and interpreter, Adler is chiefly an educator. In refusing to leave the patient in a childish condition, helpless for all his valuable understanding, and in trying by every device of education to make him a normally adapted person, Adler modifies Freud\'s procedure. He does all this apparently in the conviction that social adaptation and normalization are indispensable\u2014that they are even the most desirable goals and the most suitable fulfillment for a human being. The widespread social influence of Adler\'s school is a consequence of this outlook\u2014as also its neglect of the unconscious, which on occasions, it seems, amounts to complete denial.","We do not sufficiently distinguish between individualism and individuation. Individualism means deliberately stressing and giving prominence to some supposed peculiarity rather than to collective consideration and obligations. But individuation means precisely the better and more complete fulfillment of the collective qualities of the human being, since adequate consideration of the peculiarity of the individual is more conducive to a better social performance than when the peculiarity is neglected or suppressed. The idiosyncrasy of an individual is not to be understood as any strangeness in his substance or in his components, but rather as a unique combination, or gradual differentiation, of functions and faculties which in themselves are universal. Every human face has a nose, two eyes, etc., but these universal factors are variable, and it is this variability which makes individual peculiarities possible. Individuation, therefore, can only mean a process of psychological development that fulfils the individual qualities given; in other words, it is a process by which a man becomes the definite, unique being he in fact is. In so doing he does not become \u201cselfish in the ordinary sense of the word, but is merely fulfilling the peculiarity of his nature, and this, as we have said, is vastly different from egotism or individualism.\u201d","Thousands of miles lay between me and Europe, mother of all demons. The demons could not reach me here\u2014there were no telegrams, no telephone calls, no letters, no visitors. My liberated psychic forces poured blissfully back to the primeval expanses.","The mere use of words is futile when you do not know what they stand for. This is particularly true in psychology, where we speak of archetypes like the anima and animus, the wise man, the great mother, and so on. You can know all about the saints, sages, prophets, and other godly men, and all the great mothers of the world. But if they are mere images whose numinosity you have never experienced, it will be as if you were talking in a dream, for you will not know what you are talking about. The mere words you use will be empty and valueless. They gain life and meaning only when you try to take into account their numinosity\u2014i.e., their relationship to the living individual. Only then do you begin to understand that their names mean very little, whereas the way they are related to you is all-important.","Lo peor que le puede ocurrir a cualquiera es que se le comprenda por completo.","The perpetual hesitation of the neurotic to launch out into life is readily explained by his desire to stand aside so as not to get involved in the dangerous struggle for existence. But anyone who refuses to experience life must stifle his desire to live \u2013 in other words, he must commit partial suicide.","One sunny day, when Jung was twelve, he was traversing the M\xfcnsterplatz in Basel, admiring the sun shining on the newly restored glazed roof tiles of the cathedral. He then felt the approach of a terrible, sinful thought, which he pushed away. Hewas in a state of anguish for several days. Finally, after convincing himself that it was God who wanted him to think this thought, just as it had been God who had wanted Adam and Eve to sin, he let himself contemplate it, and saw God on his throne unleashingan almighty turd on the cathedral, shattering its new roof and smashing the cathedral. With this, Jung felt a sense of bliss and relief such as he had never experienced before. He felt that it was an experience of the \\"direct living God, who stands omnipotentand free above the Bible and Church.\\" He felt alone before God, and that his real responsibility commenced then.","Until you allow the unconscious to become conscious, it will rise up to you as your life and you will call it your fate","When thinking leads to the unthinkable, it is time to return to simple life. What thinking cannot solve, life solves, and what action never decides is reserved for thinking.","Our dream life allows us to have a look at these subliminal perceptions and shows us that they have an effect upon us. After having an agreeable dream about somebody, even without interpreting the dream, I shall involuntarily look at that person with more interest. The dream image may have deluded me, because of my projections; or it may have given me objective information. To find out which is the correct interpretation requires an honest, attentive attitude and careful thought. But, as is the case with all inner processes, it is ultimately the Self that orders and regulates one\'s human relationships, so long as the conscious ego takes the trouble to detect the delusive projections and deals with these inside himself instead of outside. It is in this way that spiritually attuned and similarly oriented people find their way to one another, to create a group that cuts across all the usual social and organizational affiliations of people. Such a group is not in conflict with others; it is merely different and independent. The consciously realized process of individuation thus changes a person\'s relationships. The familiar bonds such as kinship or common interests are replaced by a different type of unity-a bond through the Self.","In order to make clear what this fourth stage has in view, and to throw some light on the curious term \'transformation,\' we must first take account of those psychic needs of man which were not given a place in the other stages.In other words, we must ascertain what could seem more desirable or lead further than the claim to be a normally adapted, social being.Nothing is more useful or fitting than to be a normal human being; but the very notion of a \'normal human being\' suggests a restriction to the average \u2013 as does also the concept of adaptation.It is only a man who as things stand, already \ufb01nds it di\ufb03cult to come to terms with the everyday world who can see in this restriction a desirable improvement: a man, let us say, whose neurosis un\ufb01ts him for normal life.To be \'normal\' is a splendid ideal for the unsuccessful, for all those who have not yet found an adaptation.But for people who have far more ability than the average, for whom it was never hard to gain successes and to accomplish their share of the world\u2019s work-for them restriction to the normal signi\ufb01es the bed of Procrustes, unbearable boredom, infernal sterility and hopelessness.As a consequence there are many people who become neurotic because they are only normal, as there are people who are neurotic because they cannot become normal.For the former the very thought that you want to educate them to normality is a nightmare; their deepest need is really to be able to lead \'abnormal\' lives.","He would have lived countless times over the life of the individual, of the family, tribe and people, and he would possess the living sense of the rhythm of growth, flowering and decay.","The things that come to light brutally in insanity remain hidden in the background in neurosis, but they continue to influence consciousness nonetheless. When, therefore, the analysis penetrates the background of conscious phenomena, it discovers the same archetypal figures that activate the deliriums of psychotics.","What is the harm, ye ask, in not distinguishing oneself? If we do not distinguish, we get beyond our own nature, away from creatura. We fall into indistinctiveness, which is the other quality of the pleroma. We fall into the pleroma itself and cease to be creatures. We are given over to dissolution in the nothingness. This is the death of the creature. Therefore we die in such measure as we do not distinguish. Hence the natural striving of the creature goeth towards distinctiveness, fighteth against primeval, perilous sameness. This is called the\xa0principium individuationis. This principle is the essence of the creature. From this you can see why indistinctiveness and non-distinction are a great danger for the creature.","[22]\u201cThe fact is that archetypal images are so packed with meaning in themselves that people never think of asking what they really do mean...In reality, however, he has merely discovered that up till then he has never thought about his images at all.

Denouements of this sort were wreathed with the halo of a numen.","Expressionism in art prophetically anticipated this subjective development, for all art intuitively apprehends coming changes in the collective unconsciousness.","A rapprochement between empirical science and religious experience would in my opinion be fruitful for both.","Those who look outside, dream; those who look inside, awaken.","Sentimentality is the supestructure erected upon brutality.","Show me a sane person and I will cure him for you.","You must know one thing above all: a succession of words does not have only one meaning.

Doubt and insecurity are indispensable components of a complete life. Only those who can lose this life really can gain it. A complete life does not consist in a theoretical completeness, but in the fact that one accepts, without reservation, the particular fatal issue in which one finds oneself embedded, and that one tries to make sense of it or to create a cosmos from the chaotic mess into which one is born. If one lives properly and completely, time and again one will be confronted with a situation of which one will say, \u2018This is too much. I cannot bear it any more.\u2019 Then the question must be answered, \u2018Can one really not bear it?","Prophets are always disagreeable and usually have bad manners, but it is said that they occasionally hit the nail on the head . . . like every true prophet, the artist is the unwitting mouthpiece of the psychic secrets of his time and is often as unconscious as a sleep-walker.","But as soon as he has outgrown whatever local form of religion he was born to\u2014as soon as this religion can no longer embrace his life in all its fullness\u2014then the psyche becomes something in its own right which cannot be dealt with by the measures of the Church alone.","The subject of transformation is not the empirical man, however much he may identify with the \u201cold Adam, but Adam the Primordial Man, the archetype within us.

And then you are already out of it, already static, already au dessus de la m\xeal\xe9e. Of course you can take such a standpoint illegitimately before you have gone through the turmoil, just in order to avoid the conflict; people sometimes like to play that stunt, but that has no merit and they are tempted all the time to climb down into the turmoil. But if you have gone through the turmoil, if you cannot stand you any more, if the unconscious itself spits you out, then life itself spits you out as old Jonah was spit out by the whale; and then it islegitimate that you contentedly sit on the top of life, having a look at it.

I let my patients find their own symbolic expressions, their \u201cmythology.","From the beginning I had a sense of destiny, as though my life was assigned to me by fate and had to be fulfilled. This gave me an inner security, and, though I could never prove it to myself, it proved itself to me. I did not have this certainty, it had me. Nobody could rob me of the conviction that it was enjoined upon me to do what God wanted and not what I wanted. That gave me the strength to go my own way. Often I had the feeling that in all decisive matters I was no longer among men, but was alone with God. And when I was \u201cthere, where I was no longer alone, I was outside time; I belonged to the centuries; and He who then gave answer was He who had always been, who had been before my birth.

Otherwise you might just as well be a fish in the water or a tree in the woods. For every plant makes marvelous mandalas. A composite flower is a mandala, it is an image of the sun, but the flower does not know it. The human eye is a mandala, but we are not conscious of it.

It cannot be got at by reason, even in the most rational person, but only by illumination, of a degree and kind that are equal to the darkness but are the exact opposite of \u201cenlightenment. For what we call \u201crational\u201d is everything that seems \u201cfitting\u201d to the man in the street, and the question then arises whether this \u201cfitness\u201d may not in the end prove to be \u201cirrational\u201d in the bad sense of the word. Sometimes, even with the best intentions this dilemma cannot be solved. This is the moment when the primitive trusts himself to a higher authority and to a decision beyond his comprehension. The civilized man in his closed-in environment functions in a fitting and appropriate manner, that is, rationally. But if, because of some apparently insoluble dilemma, he gets outside the confines of civilization, he becomes a primitive again; then he has irrational ideas and acts on hunches; then he no longer thinks but \u201cit\u201d thinks in him; then he needs \u201cmagical\u201d practices in order to gain a feeling of security; then the latent autonomy of the unconscious becomes active and begins to manifest itself as it has always done in the past.\u201d","It consisted essentially in a dialectical gymnastics which gave the symbol of speech, the word, an absolute meaning, so that words came in the end to have a substantiality with which the ancients could invest their Logos only by attributing to it a mystical value.

What would be more natural, when we have lost ourselves amid the endless particulars and isolated details of the world\'s surface, than to knock at the door of dreams and inquire of them the bearings which would bring us closer to the basic facts of human existence?","The reactivation of original perceptions is, however, only one side of regression. The other side is regression to infantile memories, and though this might equally well be called regression to the original perceptions, it nevertheless deserves special mention because it has an importance of its own. It might even be considered as an \u201chistorical regression. In this sense the dream can, with Freud, be described as a modified memory\u2014modified through being projected into the present. The original scene of the memory is unable to effect its own revival, so has to be content with returning as a dream.\u201d","The relation between conscious and unconscious is compensatory. This fact, which is easily verifiable, affords a rule for dream interpretation. It is always helpful, when we set out to interpret a dream, to ask: What conscious attitude does it compensate?","The language and the \\"people\\" of the unconscious are symbols, and the means of communications dreams.Thus an examination of Man and his Symbols is in effect an examination of man\'s relation to his own unconscious. And since in Jung\'s view the unconscious is the great guide, friend, and adviser of the conscious, this book is related in the most direct terms to the study of human beings and their spiritual problems.","How totally different did the world appear to medieval man! For him the earth was eternally fixed and at rest in the centre of the universe\u2026Men were all children of God under the loving care of the Most High, who prepared them for eternal blessedness; and all knew exactly what they should do and how they should conduct themselves in order to rise from a corruptible world to an incorruptible and joyous existence.

How would he have dealt with certain situations in life which only occur when you are in life, when you share it?\\" Of course he was in his own life but it was a very partial one - he was not really in life as we know it. He would perhaps be a good teacher inasmuch as one is meant to live his particular life, the life of a philosophical tramp who really has the idealistic purpose of teaching a new saving truth, who recognizes no other responsibility. You see, he had no profession and no human connections which were valid to him. He separated himself from his family, was the lord of his disciples, who had to follow him while he had to follow no one, being under no obligations. This is an exceedingly simple situation, tragically simple, which is so rare that one cannot assume that the teaching coming from such a life can be possible or applicable to an entirely different type of life.Jung, C.

If they had lived in a period and in a milieu in which man was still linked by myth with the world of the ancestors, and thus with nature truly experienced and not merely seen from the outside, they would have been spared this division with themselves.","\u043c\u0438\u0437\u043e\u043d\u0435\u0438\u0437\u043c\\" \u2014 \u0441\u0442\u0440\u0430\u0445 \u043f\u0435\u0440\u0435\u0434 \u043d\u043e\u0432\u044b\u043c \u0438 \u043d\u0435\u0438\u0437\u0432\u0435\u0441\u0442\u043d\u044b\u043c.","The unconscious is not a demonic monster, but a thing of nature that is perfectly neutral as far as moral sense, \xe6sthetic taste and intellectual judgement go. It is dangerous only when our conscious attitude towards it becomes hopelessly false. And this danger grows in the measure that we practise repressions. But as soon as the patient begins to assimilate the contents that were previously unconscious, the danger from the side of the unconscious diminishes. As the process of assimilation goes on, it puts an end to the dissociation of the personality and to the anxiety that attends and inspires the separation of the two realms of the psyche. That which my critic feared\u2014I mean the overwhelming of consciousness by the unconscious\u2014is most likely to occur when the unconscious is excluded from life by repressions, or is misunderstood and depreciated.","The hero who clings to the mother is the dragon, and when the hero is reborn from the mother he becomes the conqueror of the dragon.","Before the beginning of this century, Freud and Josef Breuer had recognized that neurotic symptoms\u2014hysteria, certain types of pain, and abnormal behavior\u2014are in fact symbolically meaningful. They are one way in which the unconscious mind expresses itself, just as it may in dreams; and they are equally symbolic.","The sign is always less than the concept it represents, while a symbol always stands for something more than its obvious and immediate meaning. Symbols, moreover, are natural and spontaneous products. No genius has ever sat down with a pen or a brush in his hand and said: \u201cNow I am going to invent a symbol.","Man, as we realize if we reflect for a moment, never perceives anything fully or comprehends anything completely. He can see, hear, touch, and taste; but how far he sees, how well he hears, what his touch tells him, and what he tastes depend upon the number and quality of his senses. These limit his perception of the world around him. By using scientific instruments he can partly compensate for the deficiencies of his senses. For example, he can extend the range of his vision by binoculars or of his hearing by electrical amplification. But the most elaborate apparatus cannot do more than bring distant or small objects within range of his eyes, or make faint sounds more audible. No matter what instruments he uses, at some point he reaches the edge of certainty beyond which conscious knowledge cannot pass.","I find that all my thoughts circle around God like the planets around the sun, and are irresistibly attracted to him. I would feel like to be the grossest sin if I were to oppose any resistance to this force","Like all numinous contents, they have a tendency to self-amplification, that is to say they form the nuclei for an aggregation of synonyms. These","No one can take a more or less rational thought, reached as a logical conclusion or by deliberate intent, and then give it \u201csymbolic form. No matter what fantastic trappings one may put upon an idea of this kind, it will still remain a sign, linked to the conscious thought behind it, not a symbol that hints at something not yet known. In dreams, symbols occur spontaneously, for dreams happen and are not invented; they are, therefore, the main source of all our knowledge about symbolism.\u201d","For the sake of mental stability and even physiological health, the unconscious and the conscious must be integrally connected and thus move on parallel lines. If they are split apart or \u201cdissociated, psychological disturbance follows.\u201d","There exists a mythopoetic imagine which has vanished from our rational age.Though such imagination is present everywhere, it is both tabooed and dreaded, so that it even appears to be a risky experiment or a questionable adventure to entrust oneself to the uncertain path that leads into the depths of the unconscious.It is considered the path of error, of equivocation and misunderstanding. Unpopular, ambiguous, and dangerous, it is a voyage of discovery to the other pole of the world.","It is always helpful, when we set out to interpret a dream, to ask: What conscious attitude does it compensate","He is despised and rejected of men; a man of sorrows, and acquainted with grief: and we hid as it were our faces from him; he was despised, and we esteemed him not.","It seems to me that it would be far better stoutly to avow our spiritual poverty, our symbol-lessness, instead of feigning a legacy to which we are not the legitimate heirs at all. We are, surely, the rightful heirs of Christian symbolism, but somehow we have squandered this heritage. We have let the house our fathers built fall into decay, and now we try to break into Oriental palaces that our fathers never knew. Anyone who has lost the historical symbols and cannot be satisfied with substitutes is certainly in a very difficult position today: before him there yawns the void, and he turns away from it in horror. What is worse, the vacuum gets filled with absurd political and social ideas, which one and all are distinguished by their spiritual bleakness.","The dream-content is to be taken in all seriousness as something that has actually happened to us; it should be treated as a contributory factor in framing our conscious outlook.","Every creative person is a duality or a synthesis of contradictory aptitudes. On the one side he is a human being with a personal life, while on the other side he is an impersonal, creative process.","The more we busy ourselves with dreams, the more we shall see such coincidences \u2014chances. Remember that the oldest Chinese scientific book is about the possible chances of life.","No culture of the mind is enough to make a garden out of your soul.","It is true that there are dreams and single symbols (I should prefer to call them \u201cmotifs) that are typical and often occur. Among such motifs are falling, flying, being persecuted by dangerous animals or hostile men, being insufficiently or absurdly clothed in public places, being in a hurry or lost in a milling crowd, fighting with useless weapons or being wholly defenseless, running hard yet getting nowhere.\u201d","N\xe1bo\u017eensk\xe9 symboly jsou fenom\xe9ny \u017eivota, prost\u011b skute\u010dnostmi, nikoli n\xe1zory.

To do so would have prejudiced the outcome of the treatment.","This fact, as I shall later explain, has a direct and important bearing upon the interpretation of dreams. It is obvious that if you assume the dream to be symbolic, you will interpret it differently from a person who believes that the essential energizing thought or emotion is known already and is merely \u201cdisguised by the dream. In the latter case, dream interpretation makes little sense, for you find only what you already know.\u201d","Tik saugok Dieve nuo bet kokios psichologijos, juk per tok\u012f i\u0161tvirkim\u0105 dar imsi ir pa\u017einsi save!","To this uncertainty about the localization of psychic functions another difficulty is added. Psychic contents in general are nonspatial except in the particular realm of sensation. What bulk can we ascribe to thoughts? Are they small, large, long, thin, heavy, fluid, straight, circular, or what? If we wished to form a vivid picture of a non-spatial being of the fourth dimension, we should do well to take thought, as a being, for our model.","The things that come to light brutally in insanity remain hidden in the background in neurosis, but they continue to influence consciousness nonetheless. When, therefore, the analysis penetrates the background of conscious phenomena, it discovers the same archetypal figures that activate the deliriums of psychotics. Finally, there is any amount of literary and historical evidence to prove that in the case of these archetypes we are dealing with normal types of fantasy that occur practically everywhere and not with the monstrous products of insanity. The pathological element does not lie in the existence of these ideas, but in the dissociation of consciousness that can no longer control the unconscious. In all cases of dissociation it is therefore necessary to integrate the unconscious into consciousness. This is a synthetic process which I have termed the \u201cindividuation process.","It is for this reason that I have always said to my pupils: \u201cLearn as much as you can about symbolism; then forget it all when you are analyzing a dream. This advice is of such practical importance that I have made it a rule to remind myself that I can never understand somebody else\u2019s dream well enough to interpret it correctly. I have done this in order to check the flow of my own associations and reactions, which might otherwise prevail over my patient\u2019s uncertainties and hesitations.\u201d","Any of us can see, of course, that there is a conflict in our lives between adventure and discipline, or evil and virtue, or freedom and security. But these are only phrases we use to describe an ambivalence that troubles us, and to which we never seem able to find an answer.","Thus the interpretation of dreams, whether by the analyst or by the dreamer himself, is for the Jungian psychologist an entirely personal and individual business (and sometimes an experimental and very lengthy one as well) that can by no means be undertaken by rule of thumb.The converse of this is that the communications of the unconscious are of the highest importance to the dreamer-naturally so, since the unconscious is at least half of his total being-and frequently offer him advice or guidance that could be obtained from no other source.","L\'objectivit\xe9, v\xe9cue dans ce r\xeave et dans ces visions, rel\xe8ve de l\'individuation accomplie. Elle est d\xe9tachement des jugements de valeur et de ce que nous d\xe9signons par attachement affectif. En g\xe9n\xe9ral, l\'homme attribue une grande importance \xe0 cet attachement affectif. Or, celui-ci renferme toujours des projections et ce sont celles-ci qu\'il s\'agit de retirer et de r\xe9cup\xe9rer, pour parvenir \xe0 soi-m\xeame et \xe0 l\'objectivit\xe9. Les relations affectives sont des relations de d\xe9sir et d\'exigences, alourdies par des contraintes et des servitudes : on attend quelque chose de l\'autre, ce par quoi cet autre et soi-m\xeame perdent leur libert\xe9.

(Dr Roland Cahen)p. 467","All this being so, it is not strange that the artist is an especially interesting case for the psychologist who uses an analytical method. The artist\'s life cannot be otherwise than full of conflicts, for two forces are at war within him\u2014on the one hand the common human longing for happiness, satisfaction and security in life, and on the other a ruthless passion for creation which may go so far as to override every personal desire.","There is an answer. There is a meeting point between containment and liberation, and we can find it in the rites of initiation that I have been discussing. They can make it possible for individuals, or whole groups of people, to unite the opposing forces within themselves and achieve an equilibrium in their lives.","Nature knows two fundamentally different ways of adaptation, which determine the further existence of the living organism the one is by increased fertility, accompanied by a relatively small degree of defensive power and individual conservation; the other is by individual equipment of manifold means of self-protection, coupled with a relatively insignificant fertility.","The lives of artists are as a rule so highly unsatisfactory\u2014not to say tragic\u2014because of their inferiority on the human and personal side, and not because of a sinister dispensation. There are hardly any exceptions to the rule that a person must pay dearly for the divine gift of the creative fire. It is as though each of us were endowed at birth with a certain capital of energy. The strongest force in our make-up will seize and all but monopolize this energy, leaving so little over that nothing of value can come of it.","It would all be so much simpler if we could only deny the existence of the psyche. But here we are with our immediate experiences of something that is\u2014something that has taken root in the midst of our measurable, ponderable, three-dimensional reality, that differs bafflingly from this in every respect and in all its parts, and yet reflects it. The psyche may be regarded as a mathematical point and at the same time as a universe of fixed stars. It is small wonder, then, if, to the unsophisticated mind, such a paradoxical being borders on the divine. If it occupies no space, it has no body. Bodies die, but can something invisible and incorporeal disappear? What is more, life and psyche existed for me before I could say \\"I\\", and when this \\"I\\" disappears, as in sleep or unconsciousness, life and psyche still go on, as our observation of other people and our own dreams inform us. Why should the simple mind deny, in the face of such experiences, that the \\"soul\\" lives in a realm beyond the body? I must admit that I can see as little nonsense in this so-called superstition as in the findings of research regarding heredity or the basic instincts.","It is an every-day experience that our emotions are never at the level of our reasoning.","Na\u0161e doba je epochou chaosu a rozkladu.

It is a fact that the unconscious contains subliminal perceptions whose scope is nothing less than astounding. In recognition of this fact, primitive societies used dreams and visions as important sources of information. Great and enduring civilizations like those of the Hindus and Chinese built upon this foundation and developed from it a discipline of self-knowledge which they brought to a high pitch of refinement both in philosophy and in practice.","One idea led to another, and in his relaxed mood he found that this \u201cfree association had stirred up many old memories.

We are inclined to assume that, in the last resort, all knowledge comes from without. Yet today we know for certain that the unconscious contains contents which would mean an immeasurable increase of knowledge if they could only be made conscious.","Le livre sur les types apporta la connaissance que tout jugement d\'un homme est limit\xe9 par son type personnel et que chaque fa\xe7on de voir est relative.

These are nothing but the regrettable results of the fact that he is an artist\u2014that is to say, a man who from his very birth has been called to a greater task than the ordinary mortal. A special ability means a heavy expenditure of energy in a particular direction, with a consequent drain from some other side of life.","Kol nepasversite savo nes\u0105momingumo s\u0105moningumo, tol jis ves jus gyvenimo keliu, o j\u016bs vadinsite tai likimu.","The fact is that if one tries beyond one\'s capacity to be perfect, the shadow descends into hell and becomes the devil.","It makes no difference whether the poet knows that his work is begotten, grows and matures with him, or whether he supposes that by taking thought he produces it out of the void. His opinion of the matter does not change the fact that his own work outgrows him as a child its mother. The creative process has feminine quality, and the creative work arises from unconscious depths\u2014we might say, from the realm of the mothers. Whenever the creative force predominates, human life is ruled and moulded by the unconscious as against the active will, and the conscious ego is swept along on a subterranean current, being nothing more than a helpless observer of events.

That is the age-old danger, instinctively known and feared by primitive man, who himself stands so very close to this pleroma. His consciousness is still uncertain, wobbling on its feet. It is still childish, having just emerged from the primal waters. A wave of the unconscious may easily roll over it, and then he forgets who he was and does things that are strange to him. Hence primitives are afraid of uncontrolled emotions, because consciousness breaks down under them and gives way to possession. All man\'s strivings have therefore been directed towards the consolidation of consciousness. This was the purpose of rite and dogma; they were dams and walls to keep back the dangers of the unconscious, the \\"perils of the soul.\\" Primitive rites consist accordingly in the exorcising of spirits, the lifting of spells, the averting of the evil omen, propitiation, purification, and the production by sympathetic magic of helpful occurrences.","For example, a suitable explanation or a comforting word to the patient may have something like a healing effect which may even influence the glandular secretions. The doctor\'s words, to be sure, are \\"only\\" vibrations in the air, yet they constitute a particular set of vibrations corresponding to a particular psychic state in the doctor. The words are effective only in so far as they convey a meaning or have significance. It is their meaning which is effective. But \\"meaning\\" is something mental or spiritual. Call it a fiction if you like. None the less it enables us to influence the course of the disease in a far more effective way than with chemical preparations. We can even influence the biochemical processes of the body by it. Whether the fiction arises in me spontaneously, or reaches me from without by way of human speech, it can make me ill or cure me. Nothing is surely more intangible and unreal than fictions, illusions and opinions; and yet nothing is more effective in the psychic and even the psychophysical realm.","Proti d\xe9moni\u010dnosti vnit\u0159n\xedho sv\u011bta chr\xe1n\xed n\xe1bo\u017eensk\xe1 forma, dokud m\xe1 c\xedrkev autoritu.

They are seeking new outlets for their unconscious. Where Gnostics feel cut off from the outer world, contemporaries feel cut off from the inner one. Contemporaries do not, like Gnostics, project their alienation onto the cosmos; through Jungian psychology they seek to discover their true selves within rather than outside themselves. They alone, then, have the chance fully to overcome their alienation.","I once saw a striking contrast in the use made of material in Florence. I saw first in the Boboli gardens the two wonderful figures of the barbarians-you remember perhaps those antique stone statues. They are made of stone, consist of stone, represent the spirit of stone: you feel that stone has had the word! Then I went to the tombs of the Medici and saw what Michelangelo did to stone; there the stone has been brought to a super-life. It makes gestures which stone never would make; it is hysterical and exaggerated. The difference was amazing. Or go further to a man like Houdon and you see that the stone becomes absolutely acrobatic. There is the same difference between the Norman and Gothic styles. In the Gothic frame of mind stone behaves like a plant, not like a normal stone, while the Norman style is completely suggested by the stone. The stone speaks. Also an antique Egyptian temple is a most marvelous example of what stone can say; the Greek temple already plays tricks with stone, but the Egyptian temple is made of stone. It grows out of stone \u2014 the temple of Abu Simbel, for example, is amazing in that respect. Then in those cave temples in India one sees again the thing man brings into stone. He takes it into his hands and makes it jump, fills it with an uncanny sort of life which destroys the peculiar spirit of the stone. And in my opinion it is always to the detriment of art when matter has no say in the game of the artist. The quality of the matter is exceedingly important \u2014 it is all-important. For instance, I think it makes a tremendous difference whether one paints with chemical colors or with so-called natural colors. All that fuss medieval painters made about the preparation of their backgrounds or the making and mixing of their colors had a great advantage. No modern artist has ever brought out anything like the colors which those old masters produced. If one studies an old picture, one feels directly that the color speaks, the color has its own life, but with a modern artist it is most questionable whether the color has a life of its own. It is all made by man, made in Germany or anywhere else, and one feels it. So the projection into matter is not only a very important but an indispensable quality of art. Jung, C. G..

It has been shown that the drive, or instinct, is a condition of psychic activity, while at the same time the psychic processes seem to condition the instincts.","He considered personality to be an achievement, not something given. Moreover, it was essentially an achievement of the second half of life. In the first half of life, a person is, and should be, concerned with emancipating himself from parents and with establishing himself in the world as spouse, parent and effective contributor.","It is no reproach to the Freudian and Adlerian theories that they are based upon the drives; the only trouble is that they are one-sided. The kind of psychology they represent leaves out the psyche, and is suited to people who believe that they have no spiritual needs or aspirations.","ISIt happened in October of the year 1913 as I was leaving alone for a journey; that during the day I was suddenly overcome in broad daylight by a vision: I saw a terrible flood that covered all the northern and low-lying lands between the North Sea and the Alps. It reached from England up to Russia, and from the coast of the North Sea right up to the Alps. I saw yellow waves, swimming rubble, and the death of countless thousands.This vision lasted for two hours, it confused me and made me ill. I was not able to interpret it. Two weeks passed then the vision returned, still more violent than before, and an inner voice spoke: \\"look at it, it is completely real, and it will come to pass. You cannot doubt this.\\" I wrestled again for two hours with this vision, but it held me fast. It left me exhausted and confused. And I thought my mind had gone crazy.I6From then on the anxiety toward the terrible event that stood directly before us kept coming back. Once I also saw a sea ofblood over the northern lands.In the year 1914 in the month ofJune, at the beginning and end of the month, and at the beginning ofJuly; I had the same dream three times: I was in a foreign land, and suddenly; overnight and right in the middle ofsummer, a terrible cold descended from space. All seas and rivers were locked in ice, every green living thing had frozen.The second dream was thoroughly similar to this. But the third dream at the beginning of July went as follows:I was in a remote English land.I7 It was necessary that I return to my homeland with a fast ship as speedily as possible.I8 I reached home quicldy.I9 In my homeland I found that in the middle of summer a terrible cold had fallen from space, which had turned every living thing into ice. There stood a leaf-bearing but fruit- lesstree,whoseleaveshadturnedintosweetgrapesfullofhealing juicethroughtheworkingofthefrost.2oIpickedsomegrapes and gave them to a great waiting throng.2IIn reality; now, it was so: At the time when the great war broke out between the peoples of Europe, I found myself in Scotland,22 compelled by the war to choose the fastest ship and the shortest route home. I encountered the colossal cold that froze everything, I met up with the flood, the sea of blood, and found my barren tree whose leaves the frost had transformed into a remedy. And I plucked the ripe fruit and gave it to you and I do notknowwhatIpouredoutforyou,whatbitter-sweetintoxicating drink, which left on your tongues an aftertaste of blood.Believe me:23 It is no teaching and no instruction that I give you. Onwhat basis should I presume to teach your I give you news o f the way o f this man, but not ofyour own way. My path is not your path therefore I / cannotteachyou.24 Thewayiswithinus, butnotinGods, norinteachings, nor in laws. Within us is the way, the truth, and the life.",". . .so intimate is the intermingling of bodily and psychic traits wrote Carl Jung \u201cthat not only can we draw far-reaching inferences as to the constitution of the psyche from the constitution of the body, but we can also infer from psychic peculiarities the corresponding bodily characteristics.\u201d","A child certainly allows himself to be impressed by the grand talk of his parents, wrote Jung \u201cbut do they really imagine he is educated by it? Actually it is the parents\u2019 lives that educate the child \u2013 what they add by word at best serves only to confuse him.\u201d","In this matter both the doctor and the patient deceive themselves. Although the theories of Freud and Adler come much nearer to getting at the bottom of the neuroses than does any earlier approach to the question from the side of medicine, they still fail, because of their exclusive concern with the drives, to satisfy the deeper spiritual needs of the patient. They are still bound by the premises of nineteenth century science, and they are too self-evident\u2014they give too little value to fictional and imaginative processes. In a word, they do not give meaning enough to life. And it is only the meaningful that sets us free.","The endless dilemma of culture and nature is always a question of too much or too little, never of either-or.","If, on the other hand, a man\'s experience of his mother has been positive, this can also affect his anima in typical but different ways, with the result that he either becomes effeminate or is preyed upon by women and thus is unable to cope with the hardships of life. An anima of this sort can turn men into sentimentalists, or they may become as touchy as old maids or as sensitive as the fairy-tale princess who could feel a pea under 30 mattresses. A still more subtle manifestation of a negative anima appears in some fairy tales in the form of a princess who asks her suitors to answer a series of riddles or, perhaps, to hide themselves under her nose. If they cannot give the answers, or if she can find them, they must die\u2014and she invariably wins. The anima in this guise involves men in a destructive intellectual game. We can notice the effect of this anima trick in all those neurotic pseudo-intellectual dialogues that inhibit a man from getting into direct touch with life and its real decisions. He reflects about life so much that he cannot live it and loses all his spontaneity and outgoing feeling.","Tento st\u0159ed jsem ozna\u010dil jako bytostn\xe9 J\xe1.

They afford, after all, no answer to the question of spiritual suffering and its innermost meaning. A psycho-neurosis must be understood as the suffering of a human being who has not discovered what life means for him. But all creativeness in the realm of the spirit as well as every psychic advance of man arises from a state of mental suffering, and it is spiritual stagnation, psychic sterility, which causes this state.","At this point, however, it occurred to me that (if I was right so far) it might reasonably follow that dreams have some special and more significant function of their own. Very often dreams have a definite, evidently purposeful structure, indicating an underlying idea or intention\u2014though, as a rule, the latter is not immediately comprehensible.

To begin with, he will probably hand over his patient to the clergyman or the philosopher, or abandon him to that perplexity which is the special note of our day. As a doctor he is not required to have a finished outlook on life, and his professional conscience does not demand it of him. But what will he do when he sees only too clearly why his patient is ill; when he sees that it arises from his having no love, but only sexuality; no faith, because he is afraid to grope in the dark; no hope, because he is disillusioned by the world and by life; and no understanding, because he has failed to read the meaning of his own existence?","This new thought was a turning-point in the development of my psychology. It meant that I gradually gave up following associations that led far away from the text of a dream. I chose to concentrate rather on the associations to the dream itself, believing that the latter expressed something specific that the unconscious was trying to say.","\u0411\u0440\u0430\u043a \u043a\u0430\u043a \u043f\u0441\u0438\u0445\u043e\u043b\u043e\u0433\u0438\u0447\u0435\u0441\u043a\u043e\u0435 \u043e\u0442\u043d\u043e\u0448\u0435\u043d\u0438\u0435\u041f\u0440\u043e\u0441\u0442\u0430\u044f \u043d\u0430\u0442\u0443\u0440\u0430 \u0434\u0435\u0439\u0441\u0442\u0432\u0443\u0435\u0442 \u043d\u0430 \u0441\u043b\u043e\u0436\u043d\u0443\u044e \u0441\u043b\u043e\u0432\u043d\u043e \u043c\u0430\u043b\u0435\u043d\u044c\u043a\u0430\u044f \u043a\u043e\u043c\u043d\u0430\u0442\u0430, \u043d\u0435 \u043f\u0440\u0435\u0434\u043e\u0441\u0442\u0430\u0432\u043b\u044f\u044e\u0449\u0430\u044f \u0435\u043c\u0443 \u0431\u043e\u043b\u044c\u0448\u043e\u0433\u043e \u043f\u0440\u043e\u0441\u0442\u0440\u0430\u043d\u0441\u0442\u0432\u0430. \u0421\u043b\u043e\u0436\u043d\u0430\u044f \u043d\u0430\u0442\u0443\u0440\u0430, \u043d\u0430\u043f\u0440\u043e\u0442\u0438\u0432, \u043f\u0440\u0435\u0434\u043e\u0441\u0442\u0430\u0432\u043b\u044f\u0435\u0442 \u043f\u0440\u043e\u0441\u0442\u043e\u043c\u0443 \u0447\u0435\u043b\u043e\u0432\u0435\u043a\u0443 \u0441\u043b\u0438\u0448\u043a\u043e\u043c \u0431\u043e\u043b\u044c\u0448\u043e\u0435 \u043f\u043e\u043c\u0435\u0449\u0435\u043d\u0438\u0435 \u0441 \u043e\u0433\u0440\u043e\u043c\u043d\u044b\u043c \u043f\u0440\u043e\u0441\u0442\u0440\u0430\u043d\u0441\u0442\u0432\u043e\u043c, \u0442\u0430\u043a \u0447\u0442\u043e \u0442\u043e\u0442 \u043d\u0438\u043a\u043e\u0433\u0434\u0430 \u043d\u0435 \u0437\u043d\u0430\u0435\u0442, \u0433\u0434\u0435 \u043e\u043d, \u0441\u043e\u0431\u0441\u0442\u0432\u0435\u043d\u043d\u043e \u0433\u043e\u0432\u043e\u0440\u044f, \u043d\u0430\u0445\u043e\u0434\u0438\u0442\u0441\u044f.\u041f\u0440\u0438\u0440\u043e\u0434\u0430 \u0430\u0440\u0438\u0441\u0442\u043e\u043a\u0440\u0430\u0442\u0438\u0447\u043d\u0430. \u041d\u043e\u0440\u043c\u0430\u043b\u044c\u043d\u044b\u0439 \u0447\u0435\u043b\u043e\u0432\u0435\u043a - \u044d\u0442\u043e \u0444\u0438\u043a\u0446\u0438\u044f, \u0445\u043e\u0442\u044f \u0438 \u0435\u0441\u0442\u044c \u043e\u043f\u0440\u0435\u0434\u0435\u043b\u0435\u043d\u043d\u044b\u0435 \u0438\u043c\u0435\u044e\u0449\u0438\u0435 \u0432\u0441\u0435\u043e\u0431\u0449\u0438\u0439 \u0445\u0430\u0440\u0430\u043a\u0442\u0435\u0440 \u0437\u0430\u043a\u043e\u043d\u043e\u043c\u0435\u0440\u043d\u043e\u0441\u0442\u0438. \u0414\u0443\u0448\u0435\u0432\u043d\u0430\u044f \u0436\u0438\u0437\u043d\u044c \u043f\u0440\u0435\u0434\u0441\u0442\u0430\u0432\u043b\u044f\u0435\u0442 \u0441\u043e\u0431\u043e\u0439 \u0440\u0430\u0437\u0432\u0438\u0442\u0438\u0435, \u043a\u043e\u0442\u043e\u0440\u043e\u0435 \u043c\u043e\u0436\u0435\u0442 \u043f\u0440\u0435\u043a\u0440\u0430\u0442\u0438\u0442\u044c\u0441\u044f \u0443\u0436\u0435 \u043d\u0430 \u0441\u0430\u043c\u044b\u0445 \u043d\u0438\u0436\u043d\u0438\u0445 \u0441\u0442\u0443\u043f\u0435\u043d\u044f\u0445. \u042d\u0442\u043e \u043f\u043e\u0434\u043e\u0431\u043d\u043e \u0442\u043e\u043c\u0443, \u043a\u0430\u043a \u0435\u0441\u043b\u0438 \u0431\u044b \u043a\u0430\u0436\u0434\u044b\u0439 \u0438\u043d\u0434\u0438\u0432\u0438\u0434 \u043e\u0431\u043b\u0430\u0434\u0430\u043b \u0441\u043f\u0435\u0446\u0438\u0444\u0438\u0447\u0435\u0441\u043a\u0438\u043c \u0432\u0435\u0441\u043e\u043c, \u0432 \u0441\u043e\u043e\u0442\u0432\u0435\u0442\u0441\u0442\u0432\u0438\u0438 \u0441 \u043a\u043e\u0442\u043e\u0440\u044b\u043c \u043e\u043d \u043f\u043e\u0434\u043d\u0438\u043c\u0430\u043b\u0441\u044f \u0431\u044b \u0438\u043b\u0438 \u043e\u043f\u0443\u0441\u043a\u0430\u043b\u0441\u044f \u043d\u0430 \u0442\u0443 \u0441\u0442\u0443\u043f\u0435\u043d\u044c, \u0433\u0434\u0435 \u043e\u043d \u0434\u043e\u0441\u0442\u0438\u0433\u0430\u0435\u0442 \u0441\u0432\u043e\u0438\u0445 \u043f\u0440\u0435\u0434\u0435\u043b\u043e\u0432. \u0410\u043d\u0430\u043b\u043e\u0433\u0438\u0447\u043d\u043e \u043e\u0431\u0441\u0442\u043e\u0438\u0442 \u0434\u0435\u043b\u043e \u0441 \u0435\u0433\u043e \u0438\u0434\u0435\u044f\u043c\u0438 \u0438 \u0443\u0431\u0435\u0436\u0434\u0435\u043d\u0438\u044f\u043c\u0438.","Proti tomu vyvinulo v\u011bdeck\xe9 kr\xe9do na\u0161\xed doby pov\u011br\u010divou fobii v\u016f\u010di fantazii.

Of course these cases do not often confront the institutional psychiatrist. Those in this condition do not themselves suspect it. A certain presentiment perhaps finds indirect expression in the individual\'s special interest in psychology and psychiatry, if he is drawn to such things as the moth to the light. Since the analytical technique brings the unconscious into evidence it destroys in these cases the salutary compensation that existed, and the unconscious breaks out in the form of uncontrollable phantasies and consequent conditions of excitement, which under certain circumstances may lead directly to a psychical disorder, and even eventually to suicide.","Neust\xe1le naivn\u011b vych\xe1z\xedme z domn\u011bnky, \u017ee jsme jedin\xfdmi p\xe1ny ve sv\xe9m vlastn\xedm dom\u011b.

that it is just as pre- sumptuous and fantastic to assume that matter produces mind, that apes give rise to human beings, that from the harmonious interplay of the drives of hunger, love, and power Kant\u2019s Critique of Pure Reason should have emerged, and that all this could not possibly be other than it is.","He was the man I mentioned who was obsessed by the idea that he had cancer, although X-rays had proved to him that it was all imaginary. Who or what caused this idea? It obviously derived from a fear that was not caused by observation of the facts. It suddenly overcame him and then remained.","The limitation of consciousness in space and time is such an overwhelming reality that every occasion when this fundamental truth is broken through must rank as an event of the highest theoretical significance, for it would prove that the space- time barrier can be annulled. The annulling factor would then be the psyche, since space-time would attach to it at most as a relative and conditioned quality. Under certain conditions it could even break through the barriers of space and time precisely because of a quality essential to it, that is, its relatively trans- spatial and trans-temporal nature. This possible transcendence of space-time, for which it seems to me there is a good deal of evidence, is of such incalculable import that it should spur the spirit of research to the greatest effort. Our present development of consciousness is, however, so backward that in general we still lack the scientific and intellectual equipment for adequately evaluating the facts of telepathy so far as they have bearing on the nature of the psyche. I have referred to this group of phenomena merely in order to point out that the psyche\u2019s attachment to the brain, i.e., its space-time limitation, is no longer as self-evident and incontrovertible as we have hitherto been led to believe.","Popad\u0142bym w znany b\u0142\u0105d autobiograf\xf3w, kt\xf3ry polega na tym, \u017ce albo snuj\u0105 iluzje, jak to by\u0107 powinno, albo kre\u015bl\u0105 jak\u0105\u015b apologia pro vita sua.

It was not foreseen in his philosophical brand of psychology, where everything flowed neatly from consciousness and sense-perception. The professor admitted that his case was pathological, but there his thinking stopped, because it had arrived at the sacrosanct border-line between the philosophical and the medical faculty.","The self, of which the mandala is a symbol, is the archetype of unity and totality. Jung believed that this archetype was the underlying reality manifesting itself in the various systems of monotheism. The self, therefore, is the God within; and the individual, in seeking self-realization and unity, becomes the means through which \u201cGod seeks his goal.

The judgment of the unconscious is an intuitive one, but it is under favorable circumstances completely sure.","The fact that many clergymen seek support or practical help from Freud\'s theory of sexuality or Adler\'s theory of power is astonishing, inasmuch as both these theories are hostile to spiritual values, being, as I have said, psychology without the psyche.

In the last analysis, therefore, they lead to an autoerotic or autistic condition in which one dreams a world whose reality remains forever unattainable. The resultant sentiment d\u2019incompl\xe9tude and the still worse feeling of sterility are in their turn explained by projection as the malevolence of the environment, and by means of this vicious circle the isolation is intensified. The more projections are thrust in between the subject and the environment, the harder it is for the ego to see through its illusions. A forty-five-year-old patient who had suffered from a compulsion neurosis since he was twenty and had become completely cut off from the world once said to me: \u201cBut I can never admit to myself that I\u2019ve wasted the best twenty-five years of my life! It is often tragic to see how blatantly a man bungles his own life and the lives of others yet remains totally incapable of seeing how much the whole tragedy originates in himself, and how he continually feeds it and keeps it going. Not consciously, of course \u2013 for consciously he is engaged in bewailing and cursing a faithless world that recedes further and further into the distance. Rather, it is an unconscious factor which spins the illusions that veil his world. And what is being spun is a cocoon, which in the end will completely envelop him.\u201d","This conflict illustrates a vital point about dream analysis. It is not so much a technique that can be learned and applied according to the rules as it is a dialectical exchange between two personalities. If it is handled as a mechanical technique, the individual psychic personality of the dreamer gets lost and the therapeutic problem is reduced to the simple question: Which of the two people concerned\u2014the analyst or the dreamer\u2014will dominate the other? I gave up hypnotic treatment for this very reason, because I did not want to impose my will on others. I wanted the healing processes to grow out of the patient\u2019s own personality, not from suggestions by me that would have only a passing effect. My aim was to protect and preserve my patient\u2019s dignity and freedom, so that he could live his life according to his own wishes. In this exchange with Freud, it dawned on me for the first time that before we construct general theories about man and his psyche we should learn a lot more about the real human being we have to deal with. The individual is the only reality. The further we move away from the individual toward abstract ideas about Homo sapiens, the more likely we are to fall into error. In these times of social upheaval and rapid change, it is desirable to know much more than we do about the individual human being, for so much depends upon his mental and moral qualities. But if we are to see things in their right perspective, we need to understand the past of man as well as his present. That is why an understanding of myths and symbols is of essential importance.","Why are you looking around for help? Do you believe that help will come from outside? What is to come is created in you and from you. Hence look into yourself. Do not compare, do not measure. No other way is like yours. All other ways deceive and tempt you.

Personality is an act of the greatest courage in the face of life, and means unconditional affirmation of all that constitutes the individual, the most successful adaptation to the universal conditions of human existence, with the greatest possible freedom of personal decision.","There are no longer any gods whom we can invoke to help us. The great religions of the world suffer from increasing anemia, because the helpful numina have fled from the woods, rivers, and mountains, and from animals, and the god-men have disappeared underground into the unconscious. There we fool ourselves that they lead an ignominious existence among the relics of our past.","In other words, it is quite within the bounds of possibility for a man to recognize the relative evil of his nature, but it is a rare and shattering experience for him to gaze into the face of absolute evil.","The effect on all individuals, which one would like to see realized, may not set in for hundreds of years, for the spiritual transformation of mankind follows the slow tread of the centuries and cannot be hurried or held up by any rational process of reflection, let alone brought to fruition in one generation. What does lie within our reach, however, is the change in individuals who have, or create for themselves, an opportunity to influence others of like mind. I do not mean by persuading or preaching\u2014I am thinking, rather, of the well-known fact that anyone who has insight into his own actions, and has thus found access to the unconscious, involuntarily exercises an influence on his environment. The deepening and broadening of his consciousness produce the kind of effect which the primitives call \u201cmana.","Just when people were congratulating themselves on having abolished [the belief in demons], it turned out that instead of haunting the attic or old ruins the [demons] were flitting about in the heads of apparently normal Europeans.

But these are only phrases we use to describe an ambivalence that troubles us, and to which we never seem able to find an answer.","From this line of reasoning, I concluded that only the material that is clearly and visibly part of a dream should be used in interpreting it. The dream has its own limitation. Its specific form itself tells us what belongs to it and what leads away from it. While \u201cfree association lures one away from that material in a kind of zigzag line, the method I evolved is more like a circumambulation whose center is the dream picture. I work all around the dream picture and disregard every attempt that the dreamer makes to break away from it. Time and time again, in my professional work, I have had to repeat the words: \u201cLet\u2019s get back to your dream. What does the dream say?\u201d","The effect on all individuals, which one would like to see realized, may not set in for hundreds of years, for the spiritual transformation of mankind follows the slow tread of the centuries and cannot be hurried or held up by any rational process of reflection, let alone brought to fruition in one generation. What does lie within our reach, however, is the change in individuals who have, or create for themselves, an opportunity to influence others of like mind. I do not mean by persuading or preaching\u2014I am thinking, rather, of the well-known fact that anyone who has insight into his own actions, and has thus found access to the unconscious, involuntarily exercises an influence on his environment. The deepening and broadening of his consciousness produce the kind of effect which the primitives call \u201cmana. It is an unintentional influence on the unconscious of others, a sort of unconscious prestige, and its effect lasts only so long as it is not disturbed by conscious

unintelligible connections of facts and thus enable man to penetrate deeper into the mystery of life. I am convinced that Jung\'s ideas can serve in this way to find and interpret new facts in many fields of science (and also everyday life) simultaneously leading the individual to a more balanced, more ethical, and wider conscious outlook. If the reader should feel stimulated to work further on the investigation and assimilation of the unconscious-which always begins by working on oneself-the purpose of this introductory book would be fulfilled.","All mass movements,",". . .the \u201cnation (like the \u201cState\u201d) is a personified concept \u2026The nation has no life of its own apart from the individual, and is therefore not an end in itself\u2026. All life is individual life, in which alone the ultimate meaning is to be found.\u201d","How are you fulfilling your life\u2019s task ([your] \u201cmission), your raison d\u2019\xeatre, the meaning and purpose of your existence? This is the question of individuation, the most fateful of all questions. . .\u201d","Myth is the revelation of divine life in man. It is not we who invent myth; rather it speaks to us as a Word of God. No science will ever replace myth, and a myth cannot be made out of any science. For it is not that \'God\' is a myth, but that myth is the revelation of a divine life in man. It is not we who invent myth; rather it speaks to us as a Word of God.","In short, Jung\u2019s insights need to be considered as one of the latest and greatest manifestations of the stream of alternative spirituality which descends from the Gnostics.130","one form of life cannot simply be abandon unless it is exchanged for another","But all our attempts have proved to be singularly ineffectual, and will continue to do so as long as we try to convince ourselves and the world that it is only they, our opponents, who are all wrong, morally and philosophically.","Then the One, that was hidden in the shell, Was born through the force of fiery torment. From it there arose in the beginning love,170 Which is the germ and the seed of knowledge. The wise found the root of being in not-being By investigating the impulses of the human heart.","A comment on these men is made in the dream: \u201cIt is said they are dead. But Henry is alone. Who makes the statement? It is a voice\u2014and when a voice is heard in a dream it is a most meaningful occurrence. Dr. Jung identified the appearance of a voice in dreams with an intervention of the Self. It stands for a knowledge that has its roots in the collective fundamentals of the psyche. What the voice says cannot be disputed.\u201d","With the very decision to put his own way above all other ways he has already in large part fulfilled his liberating vocation. He has cancelled the validity of all other ways for himself. He has placed his law above all conventions.","\u2026man does not live very long in the infantile environment or in the bosom of his family without real danger to his mental health. Life calls him forth to independence, and he who gives no heed to this hard call because of childish indolence and fear is threatened by a neurosis, and once the neurosis has broken out it becomes more and more a valid reason to escape the battle with life and to remain for all time in the morally poisoned infantile atmosphere.","...La neurosis es siempre un sustituto de los sufrimientos verdaderos...","Les r\xeaves pr\xe9parent la vie et ils te d\xe9terminent sans que tu comprennes leur langage. On aimerait apprendre ce langage, mais qui est capable de l\'enseigner et de l\'apprendre ? Car l\'\xe9rudition seule ne suffit pas ; il existe un savoir du c\u0153ur qui donne de plus profondes explications. Le savoir du c\u0153ur ne se trouve dans aucun livre et dans la bouche d\'aucun professeur, mais il grandit en toi comme la graine verte sort de la terre noire.

Because humans are ignorant, that knowledge must come from outside them.

It is only the collective element in the psychology of an individual that constitutes an object for science; for the individual is by definition something unique that cannot be compared with anything else. A psychologist who professes a \u201cscientific individual psychology is simply denying individual psychology. He exposes his individual psychology to the legitimate suspicion of being merely his own psychology. The psychology of every individual would need its own manual, for the general manual can deal only with collective psychology.\u201d","I do not in the least mean to say that we must never pass judgement in the cases of persons whom we desire to help and improve.

Among them I naturally reckon all repr\xe9sentations collectives, everything that we learn from the history of religion, and anything that has an \u201c-ism attached to it. The latter is only a modern variant of the denominational religions. A man may be convinced in all good faith that he has no religious ideas, but no one can fall so far away from humanity that he no longer has any dominating repr\xe9sentation collective. His very materialism, atheism, communism, socialism, liberalism, intellectualism, existentialism, or what not, testifies against his innocence. Somewhere or other, overtly or covertly, he is possessed by a supraordinate idea.\u201d","Idle dreaming is the mother of the fear of death, the sentimental deploring of what has been and the vain turning back of the clock.","Man, I, in an invisible act of creation put the stamp of perfection on the world by giving it objective existence.","So far as we have any information about man, we know that he has always and everywhere been under the influence of dominating ideas. Any one who alleges that he is not can immediately be suspected of having exchanged a known form of belief for a variant which is less known both to himself and to others. Instead of theism he is a devotee of atheism, instead of Dionysus he favours the more modern Mithras, and instead of heaven he seeks paradise on earth. [129]","For this purpose we must first make it quite clear to ourselves that all knowledge is the result of imposing some kind of order upon the reactions of the psychic system as they flow into our consciousness\u2014an order which reflects the behaviour of a meta-psychic reality, of that which is in itself real.","The psyche could be regarded as a mathematical point and at the same time as a universe of fixed stars. It is small wonder, then, if, to the unsophisticated mind, such a paradoxical being borders on the divine. If it occupies no space, it has no body. Bodies die, but can something invisible and incorporeal disappear? What is more, life and psyche existed for me before I could say \u201cI, and when this \u201cI\u201d disappears, as in sleep or unconsciousness, life and psy- che still go on, as our observation of other people and our own dreams inform us. Why should the simple mind deny, in the face of such experiences, that the \u201csoul\u201d lives in a realm beyond the body? I must admit that I can see as little nonsense in this so-called superstition as in the findings of research regarding heredity or the instincts.\u201d","A human relationship is not based on differentiation and perfection, for these only emphasize the differences or call forth the exact opposite; it is based, rather, on imperfection, on what is weak, helpless and in need of support - the very ground for dependence. The perfect have no need of others, but weakness has, for it seeks support and does not confront its partner with anything that might force him into an inferior position and even humiliate him. This humiliation may happen only too easily when high idealism plays too prominent a role.","Presupunerea c\u0103 ar exista doar o singur\u0103 psihologie, sau doar un singur principiu psihologic fundamental, reprezint\u0103 o insuportabil\u0103 tiranie exercitat\u0103 de prejudec\u0103\u021bile pseudo\u0219tiin\u021bifice privitoare la insul normal.

The very thought can make us livid with fear. We therefore do not hesitate, but lightheartedly choose the complicated course of remaining in ignorance about ourselves while busying ourselves with other people and their troubles and sins. This activity lends us an air of virtue, and we thus deceive ourselves and those around us.","Although man can forget in the long- (perhaps too long) guarded feelings of youth, in the dreamy state of stubbornly held remembrances, that the wheel rolls onward, nevertheless mercilessly does the gray hair, the relaxation of the skin and the wrinkles in the face tell us, that whether or not we expose the body to the destroying powers of the whole struggle of life, the poison of the stealthily creeping serpent of time consumes our bodies, which, alas! we so dearly love.","With a painful slice, I cut off what I pretended to know about what lies beyond me. I excise myself from the cunning interpretative loops that I gave to what lies beyond me. And my knife cuts even deeper and separates me from the meaning that I conferred upon myself.

introspection. He is blind to the fact that, with all his rationality and efficiency, he is possessed by \u201cpowers that are beyond his control. His gods and demons have not disappeared at all; they have merely got new names. They keep him on the run with restlessness, vague apprehensions, psychological complications, an insatiable need for pills, alcohol, tobacco, food\u2014and, above all, a large array of neuroses.\u201d","Neurosis is an inner cleavage\u2014the state of being at war with oneself.","The neurotic who seeks to get rid of the necessities of life wins nothing and lays upon himself the frightful burden of a premature age and death, which must appear especially cruel on account of the total emptiness and meaninglessness of his life.","Mi upravo zivimo u epohi metamorfoze bogova,sto ce reci metamorfoze osnovnih principa i simbola.To nastojanje,te aspiracije naseg vremena koje mogu izgledati porazavajuce i koje,zapravo,nismo mi sami svesno izabrali,predstavljaju izraz unutrasnje metamorfoze koja se zbiva u coveku a da on toga nije svestan.Te transformacije ce imati najteze posledice i generacije koje dolaze ce biti duzne da sacine njihov bilans ukoliko covecanstvo hoce da se spase od samounistenja koje mu snagom nauke i tehnike prete.","We cannot live in the afternoon of life according to the programme of life\'s morning- for what was great in the morning will be little at evening, and what in the morning was true will at evening have become a lie.","Assim tamb\xe9m os seres tornaram-se para mim lembran\xe7as imperec\xedveis na medida em que seus nomes sempre estiveram inscritos no livro do meu destino: conhec\xea-los equivalia a um relembrar.","Creative ideas, in my opinion, show their value in that, like keys, they help to \u201cunlock hitherto unintelligible connections of facts and thus enable man to penetrate deeper into the mystery of life.\u201d","Everything that accentuates this cleavage makes the patient worse, and everything that mitigates it tends to heal the patient. What drives people to war with themselves is the intuition or the knowledge that they consist of two persons in opposition to one another. The conflict may be between the sensual and the spiritual man, or between the ego and the shadow. It is what Faust means when he says \\"Two souls, alas, dwell in my breast apart.\\" A neurosis is a dissociation of personality.","Here we come to that aspect of initiation which acquaints man with woman and woman with man in such a way as to correct some sort of original male-female opposition. Man\'s knowledge (Logos) then encounters women\'s relatedness (Eros) and their union is represented as that symbolic ritual of a sacred marriage which has been at the heart of initiation since its origins in the mystery-religions of antiquity. But this is exceedingly difficult for modern people to grasp, and it frequently takes a special crisis in their lives to make them understand it.","one form of life cannot simply be abandoned unless it is exchanged for another","Like every other being, I am a splinter of the infinite deity, but I cannot contrast myself with any animal, any plant or any stone.","Unfortunately this is not enough meaning or purpose for many persons who see in the approach of old age a mere diminution of life, and who look upon their earlier ideals only as something faded and worn out.","We should never forget that in any psychological discussion we are not saying anything about the psyche, but that the psyche is always speaking about itself. It is no use thinking we can ever get beyond the psyche by means of the \u201cmind, even though the mind asserts that it is not dependent on the psyche. How could it prove that?\u201d","If the libido is not permitted to follow the progressive life, which is willing to accept all dangers and all losses, then it follows the other road, sinking into its own depths, working down into the old foreboding regarding the immortality of all life, to the longing for rebirth.","The conflict between the two dimensions of consciousness is simply an expression of the polaristic structure of the psyche, which like any other energic system is dependent on the tension of opposites.","... supunerea fata de legamantul de a crede numai probabilul, mediocrul, banalul si ceea ce este sarac in semnificatii, de a renunta la tot ce e strain si insemnat si de a reduce la obisnuit tot ce e neobisnuit. Existau doar... orizonturi de o ingustime apasatoare si pustiul nesfarsit al rutinei.","Dar cu cat mai civilizat, adica mai constient si mai complicat devine omul, cu atat mai putin isi poate urma instinctele. Conditiile sale complicate de viata si influenta anturajului sunt atat de raspicate, ca acopera vocea timida a naturii. Iar atunci locul naturii este luat de opinii si convingeri, de teorii si tendinte colective, care acorda tot sprijinul ratacirilor constientului. In astfel de cazuri trebuie sa dam in mod deliberat atentie inconstientului, pentru ca acesta sa-si poata exercita functia de compensare.","My pilgrim\'s progress has been to climb down a thousand

shall not be digressing if we take this opportunity to try to grasp the psychological meaning of this rupture of the natural course of instinct, which is what the Christian process of sacrifice appears to be. From what has been said it follows that conversion signifies at the same time a transition to another attitude. This also makes it clear from what source the impelling motive for conversion comes, and how far Tertullian was right in conceiving the soul as naturaliter Christiana.","The man whose interests are all outside is never satisfied with what is necessary, but is perpetually hankering after something more and better which, true to his bias, he always seeks outside himself. He forgets completely that, for all his outward successes, he himself remains the same inwardly. . .Obviously the outward lives of men could do with a lot more bettering and beautifying, but those things lose their meaning when the inner man does not keep pace with them.","Behold the secret conspiracy between mother and son, and how each helps the other to betray life.","E greu de crezut c\u0103 lumea asta bogat\u0103 ar fi prea s\u0103rac\u0103 spre a putea oferi unui om un obiect de iubit.

This is that every personification of the unconscious\u2014the shadow, the anima, the animus, and the Self\u2014has both a light and a dark aspect. We saw before that the shadow may be base or evil, an instinctive drive that one ought to overcome. It may, however, be an impulse toward growth that one should cultivate and follow. In the same way the anima and animus have dual aspects: They can bring life-giving development and creativeness to the personality, or they can cause petrification and physical death. And even the Self, the all-embracing symbol of the unconscious, has an ambivalent effect, as for instance in the Eskimo tale (this page), when the \u201clittle woman offered to save the heroine from the Moon Spirit but actually turned her into a spider.\u201d","If, for instance, I determine the weight of each stone in a bed of pebbles and get an average weight of 145 grams, this tells me very little about the real nature of the pebbles. Anyone who thought, on the basis of these findings, that he could pick up a pebbles of 145 grams at the first try would be in for a serious disappointment. Indeed, it might well happen that however long he searched he would not find a single pebble weighing exactly 145 grams. The statistical method shows the facts in the light of the ideal average but does not give us a picture of their empirical reality. While reflecting an indisputable aspect of reality, it can falsify the actual truth in a most misleading way. This is particularly true of theories which are based on statistics. The distinctive thing about real facts, however, is their individuality...one could say that the real picture consists of nothing but exceptions to the rule, and that, in consequence, absolute reality has predominantly the characteristic of *irregularity* (The Undiscovered Self)","\u2026he hopes to be caught, sucked in, enveloped, and devoured. He seeks, as it were, the protecting, nourishing, charmed circle of the mother, the condition of the infant released from every care\u2026No wonder the real world vanishes from sight!","The modern man, moreover, is not eager to know in what way he can imitate Christ, but in what way he can live his own individual life, however meagre and uninteresting it may be. It is because every form of imitation seems to him deadening and sterile that he rebels against the force of tradition that would hold him to well-trodden ways. All such roads, for him, lead in the wrong direction. He may not know it, but he behaves as if his own individual life were instinct with the will of God which must at all costs be fulfilled. This is the source of his egoism, which is one of the most tangible evils of the neurotic state. But the person who tells him he is too egoistic has lost his confidence, and rightly so, for that person has driven him still further into his neurosis.","You know, he (Nietzsche) belongs to the people living east of the Rhine where there is no anima psychology yet; masculine psychology, the Puer Eternus psychology, prevails there on account of the youth of those tribes. In the older civilization west of the Rhine the anima problem comes up, but east of the Rhine there is generally the problem of the relationship between man and the subordinate principle \u2014 an idea or an enthusiasm, for instance, or a big enterprise. It is entirely the psychology of the youth who is entering life where the world consists mainly of men. There are female appendages who serve a certain purpose, for the propagation of the tribe or for the romantic feelings, but there is no other use for them. Therefore, you actually see the idea spreading again that a woman belongs in the kitchen and is only useful to produce children \u2014 that she has no psychological problem, andno potentiality for soul-development.","we can form an objective judgment of the nation, race, or continent to which we belong only when we have lived for a time in a foreign country and so are able to look at our own country from without. How,","The dark side of the Self is the most dangerous thing of all, precisely because the Self is the greatest power in the psyche. It can cause people to \u201cspin megalomanic or other delusory fantasies that catch them up and \u201cpossess\u201d them. A person in this state thinks with mounting excitement that he has grasped and solved the great cosmic riddles; he therefore loses all touch with human reality. A reliable symptom of this condition is the loss of one\u2019s sense of humor and of human contacts.\u201d","God is not a statistical truth, hence it is just as stupid to try to prove the existence of God as to deny him. Carl Jung, Letters Vol. II","The psyche, as a reflection of the world and man, is a thing of such infinite complexity that it can be observed and studied from a great many sides. It faces us with the same problem that the world does: because a systematic study of the world is beyond our powers, we have to content ourselves with mere rules of thumb and with aspects that particularly interest us. Everyone makes for himself his own segment of world and constructs his own private system, often with air-tight compartments, so that after a time it seems to him that he has grasped the meaning and structure of the whole.","In cases of neurosis and psychosis, the unconscious attempted to compensate the one-sided conscious attitude. The unbalanced individual defends himself against this, and the opposites become more polarized. The corrective impulses that present themselves in the language of the unconscious should be the beginning of a healing process, but the form in which they break through makes them unacceptable to consciousness.","The spirit ofthis time considers itselfextremely clever, like every such spiritofthetime.Butwisdomissimpleminded,notjustsimple.Becauseof this, the clever person mocks wisdom, since mockery is his weapon. He uses thepointed,poisonousweapon,becauseheisstruckbynaivewisdom.Ifhe were not struck, he would not need the weapon. Only in the desert do we become aware ofour terrible simplemindedness, but we are aftaid ofadmitting it. {(Thatiswhywearescornful. Butmockery / doesnotattain ness. The mockeryfalls on the mocker, and in the desert where no one hears and answers, he sufficatesfrom his own scorn.The cleverer you are, the morefoolish your simplemindedness. The totally clever are total fools in their simplemindedness. We cannot save ourselves from the cleverness ofthe spirit ofthis time through increasing our cleverness, but through accepting what our cleverness hates most, namely ness. Yet we also do not want to be artificial fools because we have fallen into simplemindedness, rather we will be cleverfools. That leads to the supreme meaning. Cleverness couples itselfwith intention. Simplemindedness knowsno intention. Cleverness conquers the world, but simplemindedness, the soul. So take on the vow ofpoverty ofspirit in order to partake ofthe soul.79Against this the scorn ofmy cleverness rose Up.80 Many will laugh at my foolishness. But no one will laugh more than I laughed at myself.So I overcame scorn. But when I had overcome it, I was near to my soul, and she could speak to me, and I was soon to see the desert becominggreen.","whether you believe in a demon of the air or in a factor in the unconscious that plays diabolical tricks on you is all one to me. The fact that man\u2019s imagined unity is menaced by alien powers remains the same in either case. Theologians would do better to take account for once of these psychological facts than to go on \u201cdemythologizing them with rationalistic explanations that are a hundred years behind the times.\u201d","It is well known that Freudian psychoanalysis is limited to the task of making conscious the shadow-side and the evil within us. It simply brings into action the civil war that was latent, and lets it go at that.","To be satiated with the \u201cnecessities [of external success] is no doubt an inestimable source of happiness, yet the inner man continues to raise his claim, and this can be satisfied by no outward possessions. And the less this voice is heard in the chase after the brilliant things of this world, the more the inner man becomes a source of inexplicable misfortune and uncomprehended unhappiness in the midst of living conditions whose outcome was expected to be entirely different. The externalization of life turns to incurable suffering, because no one can understand why he should suffer from himself. . .

I was a marriedman, had children, a house, a place in the world, and a head full of ideas and plans, and suddenly I was again the child who had kindled a fire full of secret significance and sat down on a stone without knowing whether it was I or I was it. I thought suddenly of my life in Zurich, and it seemed alien to me, like news from some remote world and time. This was frightening, for the world of my childhood in which I had just become absorbed was eternal, and I had been wrenched away from it and had fallen into a time that continued to roll onward, moving farther and farther away. The pull of that other world was so strong that I had to tear myself violently from the spot in order not to lose hold of my future.","\u2026in reality only a change in the attitude of the individual can bring about a renewal in the spirit of nations.

The \\"manifest\\" dream-picture is the dream itself, and contains the \\"latent\\" meaning. If I find sugar in the urine, it is sugar, and not a fa\xe7ade that conceals albumen. When Freud speaks of the \\"dream-fa\xe7ade\\", he is really speaking, not of the dream itself, but of its obscurity, and in so doing is projecting upon the dream his own lack of understanding. We say that the dream has a false front only because we fail to see into it. We would do better to say that we are dealing with something like a text that is unintelligible, not because it has a facade, but simply because we cannot read it. We do not have to get behind such a text in the first place, but must learn to read it.","The archetypal image decides the fate of man.","But it is the same with every single human being and his reasonably ordered world. His reason has done violence to natural forces which seek their revenge and only await the moment when the partition falls to overwhelm the conscious life with destruction.","Emotional relationships are relationships of desire, tainted by coercion and constraint; something is expected from the other person, and that makes him and ourselves unfree. Objective cognition lies hidden behind the attraction of the emotional relationship; it seems to be the central secret.","As a child, I felt myself to be alone, and I am still, because I know things and must hint at things which others apparently know nothing of, and for the most part do not want to know. Loneliness does not come from having no people about one, but from being unable to communicate the things that seem important to oneself, or from holding certain views which others find inadmissable.","If such a compensatory move of the unconscious is not integrated into consciousness in an individual, it leads to a neurosis or even to a psychosis.","\u0647\u062f\u0641 \u0627\u0635\u0644\u06cc \u0631\u0648\u0627\u0646\u062f\u0631\u0645\u0627\u0646\u06cc \u0631\u0633\u0627\u0646\u062f\u0646 \u0628\u06cc\u0645\u0627\u0631 \u0628\u0647 \u0645\u0631\u062d\u0644\u0647 \u0627\u06cc \u0627\u0632 \u0634\u0627\u062f\u06a9\u0627\u0645\u06cc \u06a9\u0647 \u0646\u0627\u0645\u0645\u06a9\u0646 \u0628\u0627\u0634\u062f \u0646\u06cc\u0633\u062a\u060c \u0628\u0644\u06a9\u0647 \u06a9\u0645\u06a9 \u0628\u0647 \u0627\u0633\u062a\u0642\u0627\u0645\u062a \u0628\u06cc\u0645\u0627\u0631 \u0648 \u0634\u06a9\u06cc\u0628\u0627\u06cc\u06cc \u0641\u0644\u0633\u0641\u06cc \u0627\u0648\u0633\u062a \u062f\u0631 \u0628\u0631\u0627\u0628\u0631 \u0631\u0646\u062c \u0628\u0631\u062f\u0646.","It seems as if it were only through an experience of symbolic reality that man, vainly seeking his own \u201cexistence and making a philosophy out of it, can find his way back to a world in which he is no longer a stranger.\u201d","Now on account of this collective attitude and the utter ignorance of what the self might be-the self meaning the reality of the psyche-people have a very strong collective conscience which makes them quite ill if they try to follow their own way, to be with themselves and to work on themselves. That may amount to a real affliction, an ailment, a neurosis. But if the case is already a neurosis, then any doctor who really understands about these matters would be forced to say, \\"If the patient wants to be cured he must follow the way of his neurosis\\"-just the thing everybody is speaking against. People say; \\"If you have a neurosis keep away from it, travel to India or anywhere else where there is no neurosis, leave your neurosis in Europe, bury it there.\\" But I should say, \\"Follow the way of your neurosis; it is the best thing you ever produced, your real value.\\" And that is very much what Nietzsche means here. But he questions whether one has the right to choose that way or not, and that is of course one of the major problems. It is by no means sure that one has either the power or the right to go to one\'s self, because this is a very great and difficult enterprise. As, for instance, the Catholic church may be in doubt whether somebody has the power, the right, or the faculty to be a priest, to live like a priest or a nun. And the way to one\'s self, the way to one\'s own affliction, is the hardest, the most difficult way. We really can question, \\"Has one really the power, the energy, the patience to do it? And also, has one the right to do it?\\" For you might do it from a wrong motive; you might be really selfish-for example, if you are going to yourself in order to indulge in yourself and not to work.Jung, C. G.. Nietzsche\'s Zarathustra: Notes of the Seminar given in 1934-1939. Two Volumes: 1-2, unabridged (Jung Seminars) (p. 707)","Man has been aware of this danger since the earliest times, even in the most primitive stages of culture. It was to arm himself against this threat and to heal the damage done, that he developed religious and magical practices. This is why the medicine-man is also the priest; he is the saviour of the body as well as of the soul, and religions are systems of healing for psychic illness. This is especially true of the two, greatest religions of man, Christianity and Buddhism. Man is never helped in his suffering by what he thinks for himself, but only by revelations of a wisdom greater than his own. It is this which lifts him out of his distress.","The meaning of my existence is that life has addressed a question to me... or conversely, I myself am a question...","Give away all that thou hast, then shalt thou receive. Often, as I was writing,\u201d","The process of individuation has always been appreciated as the most valuable and important thing in life. It is the only thing that brings any lasting satisfaction to a man. Power, glory, wealth, mean nothing in comparison. These things are external and therefore futile. The really important things are within. It is more important to me that I am happy than that I have the external reason for happiness. Rich people should be happy, but often they are not, they are bored to death; therefore it is ever so much better for a man to work to produce an inner condition that gives him an inner happiness. Experience shows that there are certain psychological conditions in which man gets eternal results. They have something of the quality of eternity, of timelessness, they have the quality of reaching beyond man. They have a divine quality and yield all that satisfaction which man-made things do not.","La vida no vivida es una enfermedad de la que se puede morir.","Among many cases of this sort, I have been especially impressed with one that concerned a colleague of mine in Z\xfcrich. He was a man somewhat older than myself whom I saw from time to time, and who always teased me on these occasions about my interest in dream-interpretation. I met him one day in the street, and he called out to me: \\"How are things going? Are you still interpreting dreams? By the way, I\'ve had another idiotic dream. Does it mean something too?\\" He had dreamed as follows: \\"I am climbing a high mountain over steep, snow covered slopes. I mount higher and higher\u2014it is marvelous weather. The higher I climb, the better I feel. I think: \'If only I could go on climbing like this for ever!\' When I reach the summit, my happiness and elation are so strong that I feel I could mount right up into space. And I discover that I actually can do this. I go on climbing on empty air. I awake in a real ecstasy.\\" When he had told me his dream, I said: \\"My dear man, I know you can\'t give up mountaineering, but let me implore you not to go alone from now on. When you go, take two guides, and you must promise on your word of honour to follow their directions.\\" \\"Incorrigible!\\" he replied laughing, and said goodbye. I never saw him again. Two months later came the first blow. When out alone, he was buried by an avalanche, but was dug out in the nick of time by a military patrol which happened to come along. Three months after this the end came. He went on a climb accompanied by a younger friend, but without guides. An alpinist standing below saw him literally step out into the air as he was letting himself down a rock wall. He fell on to the head of his friend, who was waiting beneath him, and both were dashed to pieces far below. That was ecstasis in the full meaning of the word.","In 1902, he became engaged to Emma Rauschenbach, whom he married and with whom he had five children. Up till this point, Jung had kept a diary. In one of the last entries, dated May 1902, he wrote: \u201cI am no longer alone with myself, and I can only artificially recall the scary and beautiful feeling of solitude. This is the shadow side of the fortune of love. 17 For Jung, his marriage marked a move away from the solitude to which he had been accustomed.\u201d","Dac\u0103 urm\u0103rim cu aten\u021bie istoria unei nevroze, d\u0103m regulat peste un moment critic c\xe2nd s-a ivit o problem\u0103 care a fost evitat\u0103.

The sensory datum, however, is not the causa efficiens of this; rather, it is autonomously selected and exploited by the psyche, with the result that the rationality of the cosmos is constantly being violated in the most distressing manner. But the sensible world has an equally devastating effect on the deeper psychic processes when it breaks into them as a causa efficiens. If reason is not to be outraged on the one hand and the creative play of images not violently suppressed on the other, a circumspect and farsighted synthetic procedure is required in order to accomplish the paradoxical union of irreconcilables.","Many mystic experiences have a similar character: they represent an action in which the spectator becomes involved though his nature is not necessarily changed. In the same way, the most beautiful and impressive dreams often have no lasting or transformative effect on the dreamer. He may be impressed by them, but he does not necessarily see any problem in them. The event then naturally remains \u201coutside, like a ritual action performed by others. These more aesthetic forms of experience must be carefully distinguished from those which indubitably involve a change of one\u2019s nature.\u201d","Neurosis is an inner cleavage- the state of being at war with oneself.","Ng\u01b0\u1eddi ta b\u1ea3o r\u1eb1ng t\xf4i l\xe0 nh\xe0 hi\u1ec1n tri\u1ebft, nh\u01b0ng t\xf4i kh\xf4ng d\xe1m nh\u1eadn...C\xf3 khi t\xf4i ng\u1ea1c nhi\xean, c\xf3 khi t\xf4i c\u1ee5t h\u1ee9ng, c\xf3 khi t\xf4i t\u1ef1 m\xe3n, c\xf3 khi t\xf4i th\u1ea5t v\u1ecdng ch\xe1n n\u1ea3n, c\xf3 khi t\xf4i ph\u1ea5n ch\u1ea5n; t\xf4i l\xe0 t\u1ea5t c\u1ea3 nh\u1eefng t\xe2m t\xecnh \u1ea5y nh\u01b0ng kh\xf4ng th\u1ec3 c\u1ed9ng c\u1ea3 l\u1ea1i v\u1edbi nhau,,,T\xf4i kh\xf4ng cho c\xe1i g\xec l\xe0 ch\u1eafc ch\u1eafn c\u1ea3.

Consciousness is very weak in this formative period, and history shows us that the same is true of mankind\u2014the unconscious easily seizes power.","The individual is the only reality. The further we move away from the individual toward abstract ideas about Homo sapiens, the more likely we are to fall into error. In these times of social upheaval and rapid change, it is desirable to know much more than we do about the individual human being, for so much depends upon his mental and moral qualities.","The decisive question for man is: Is he related to something infinite or not? That is the telling question of his life. Only if we know that the thing which truly matters is the infinite can we avoid fixing our interest upon futilities, and upon all kinds of goals which are not of real importance. Thus we demand that the world grant us recognition for qualities which we regard as personal possessions: our talent or our beauty. The more a man lays stress on false possessions, and the less sensitivity he has for what is essential, the less satisfying is his life. He feels limited because he has limited aims, and the result is envy and jealousy. If we understand and feel that here in this life we already have a link with the infinite, desires and attitudes change. In the final analysis, we count for something only because of the essential we embody, and if we do not embody that, life is wasted. In our relationships to other men, too, the crucial question is whether an element of boundlessness is expressed in the relationship. C.G.Jung \\"Memories, Dreams, Reflections\\" ch.XI On Life after Death","To put it in scientific terms: instinctive defence-mechanisms have been developed which automatically intervene when the danger is greatest, and their coming into action is represented in fantasy by helpful images which are ineradicably fixed in the human psyche.","It is not an \u201cimitation of Christ but its exact opposite: an assimilation of the Christ-image to his own self, which is the \u201ctrue man.\u201d349 It is no longer an effort, an intentional straining after imitation, but rather an involuntary experience of the reality represented by the sacred legend. This\u201d","The relationship between doctor and patient, especially when a transference on the part of the patient occurs, or a more or less unconscious identification of doctor and patient, can lead to parapsychological phenomena. I have frequently run into this. One such case which was particularly impressive was that of a patient whom I had pulled out of a psychogenic depression. He went back home and married; but I did not care for his wife. The first time I saw her, I had an uneasy feeling. Her husband was grateful to me, and I observed that I was a thorn in her side because of my influence over him. It frequently happens that women who do not really love their husbands are jealous and destroy their friendships. They want the husband to belong entirely to them because they themselves do not belong to him. The kernel of all jealousy is lack of love.","When you say that the place of the soul is not, then it is not. But if you say that it is, then it is.","Nothing is more vulnerable and ephemeral than scientific theories, which are mere tools and not everlasting truths.","There is no recipe for living that suits all cases.","Psychology\u2019s insistence on the importance of unconscious processes for religious experience is extremely unpopular, no less with the political Right than with the Left. For the former the deciding factor is the historical revelation that came to man from outside; to the latter this is sheer nonsense, and man has no religious function at all, except belief in the party doctrine, when suddenly the most intense faith is called for. On top of this, the various creeds assert quite different things, and each of them claims to possess the absolute truth. Yet today we live in a unitary world where distances are reckoned by hours and no longer by weeks and months. Exotic races have ceased to be peepshows in ethnological museums. They have become our neighbours, and what was yesterday the private concern of the ethnologist is today a political, social, and psychological problem. Already the ideological spheres begin to touch, to interpenetrate, and the time may not be far off when the question of mutual understanding will become acute. To make oneself understood is certainly impossible without far-reaching comprehension of the other\u2019s standpoint. The insight needed for this will have repercussions on both sides. History will undoubtedly pass over those who feel it is their vocation to resist this inevitable development, however desirable and psychologically necessary it may be to cling to what is essential and good in our own tradition. Despite all the differences, the unity of mankind will assert itself irresistibly.","It is as though, at the culmination of the illness, the destructive powers were converted into healing forces. This is brought about by the fact that the archetypes come to independent life and serve as spiritual guides for the personality, thus supplanting the inadequate ego with its futile willing and striving. As the religious-minded person would say: guidance has come from God. With most of my patients I have to avoid this formulation, for it reminds them too much of what they have to reject.","The deeper layers of the psyche, he has said, \u201close their individual uniqueness as they retreat farther and farther into darkness. \u2018Lower down,\u2019 that is to say, as they approach the autonomous functional systems, they become increasingly collective until they are universalized and extinguished in the body\u2019s materiality, i.e. in chemical substances. The body\u2019s carbon is simply carbon. Hence \u2018at bottom\u2019 the psyche is simply \u2018world.\u201d","I have therefore defined sensation as perception through conscious sensory processes, and intuition as perception by way of unconscious contents and connections.","But, as Sir Herbert Read remarks in his Concise History of Modern Art, metaphysical anxiety is no longer only Germanic and northern; it now characterizes the whole of the modern world. Read quotes Klee, who wrote in his Diary at the beginning of 1915: \u201cThe more horrifying this world becomes (as it is in these days) the more art becomes abstract; while a world at peace produces realistic art. To Franz Marc, abstraction offered a refuge from the evil and ugliness in this world. \u201cVery early in life I felt that man was ugly. The animals seemed to be more lovely and pure, yet even among them I discovered so much that was revolting and hideous that my painting became more and more schematic and abstract.\u201d","For our purposes this term is apposite and helpful, because it tells us that so far as the collective unconscious contents are concerned we are dealing with archaic or\u2014I would say\u2014primordial types, that is, with universal images that have existed since the remotest times. The term \u201crepr\xe9sentations collectives, used by L\xe9vy-Bruhl to denote the symbolic figures in the primitive view of the world, could easily be applied to unconscious contents as well, since it means practically the same thing. Primitive tribal lore is concerned with archetypes that have been modified in a special way. They are no longer contents of the unconscious, but have already been changed into conscious formulae taught according to tradition, generally in the form of esoteric teaching. This last is a typical means of expression for the transmission of collective contents originally derived from the unconscious. [6]\u201d","Siegfried","It cannot be denied that primitive people are capable of concentrating upon things that interest them. If we try to give our attention to uninteresting matters, we soon notice how feeble our powers of concentration are. We ourselves, like them, are dependent upon emotional undercurrents.","La vostra visione vi apparir\xe0 pi\xf9 chiara soltanto quando guarderete nel vostro cuore. Chi guarda l\'esterno, sogna.

He is a Superman, and how can one have a friendship with a Superman? Absolutely impossible. One can only worship him as a superior being. But I wouldn\'t drink a glass of beer with a Superman. One cannot eat at the same table; one can only hold communion where he is the lord.Jung, C. G.. Nietzsche\'s Zarathustra: Notes of the Seminar given in 1934-1939.

They evoke a response from us that is much more profound than it could be from someone who has never known the intense emotional experience of war. The battles on the plains of Troy were utterly unlike the fighting at Agincourt or Borodino, yet the great writers are able to transcend the differences of time and place and express themes that are universal. We respond because these themes are fundamentally symbolic.\u201d","Small and hidden is the door that leads inward, and the entrance is barred by countless prejudices, mistaken assumptions, and fears. Always one wishes to hear of grand political and economic schemes, the very things that have landed every nation in a morass.

What has this vapid idealism got to do with gigantic economic programmes, with the so-called problems of reality?But I speak not to nations, only to the individual few, for whom it goes without saying that cultural values do not drop down like manna from heaven, but are created by the hands of individuals.

But if they are separated from feeling, it becomes quite clear that feeling values and feeling judgements\u2014that is to say, our feelings\u2014are not only reasonable, but are also as discriminating, logical and consistent as thinking.","No good breaking the tables of values, they are weak enough already; you had better hold that little bit of value together. They need no particular wildness because they will break up all by themselves and altogether too early; we know from history that values begin to break up long before there are new ones to take their place. Therefore, we always go through a time of destruction when people are without orientation and without laws. Usually only the greatest misery forces people to create new laws and new values. If Zarathustra were not so impatient, the man Nietzsche could follow him. He could give Zarathustra the right rhythm, prevent him from being too impatient. Then he would not talk of breaking the tables of values. They could be preserved a little longer. They are weak enough: they will break up without our help. It is not necessary to destroy churches. Nobody attacks Islam, but the mosques are empty; nobody attacks Protestantism, but innumerable people never go to church on Sundays.Jung, C. G.. Nietzsche\'s Zarathustra: Notes of the Seminar given in 1934-1939. Two Volumes: 1-2, unabridged (Jung Seminars) (p. 215-216)","The phallus is the source of life and libido, the great creator and worker of miracles...","I\'m sometimes driven to the conclusion that boring people need treatment more urgently than mad people.","When we think, it is in order to judge or to reach a conclusion, and when we feel it is in order to attach a proper value to something; sensation and intuition, on the other hand, are perceptive\u2014they make us aware of what is happening, but do not interpret or evaluate it. They do not act selectively according to principles, but are simply receptive of what happens. But \\"what happens\\" is merely nature, and therefore essentially non-rational.","At the root of this inner distress lies the defeat (or rather the retreat) of consciousness. In the upsurge of mystical experience, everything that once bound man to the human world, to earth, to time and space, to matter and the natural living of life, has been cast aside or dissolved. But unless the unconscious is balanced by the experience of consciousness, it will implacably reveal its contrary or negative aspect. The wealth of creative sound that made the harmony of the spheres, or the wonderful mysteries of the primal ground, have yielded to destruction and despair. In more than one case the artist has become the passive victim of the unconscious.","We analyse dreams to help us with problems because, as Jung says, \\"the problem is much greater than I, and it is wise to hold fast to the words the dream gives, because one cannot expect to be wiser than nature\\".","Prakticky to znamen\xe1, \u017ee mlad\xe9mu \u010dlov\u011bku je d\xe1no jen ne\xfapln\xe9 pozn\xe1n\xed druh\xe9ho i sebe sama, a proto m\u016f\u017ee zn\xe1t motivy druh\xe9ho \u010dlov\u011bka i sv\xe9 vlastn\xed jen nedostate\u010dn\u011b.

They cannot be based upon both at once, because sensation is just as antagonistic to intuition as thinking is to feeling. When I try to assure myself with my eyes and ears of what actually occurs, I cannot at the same time give way to dreams and fantasies as to what lies round the corner. As this is just what the intuitive type must do in order to give free play to the unconscious or to the object, it is easy to see that the sensation type is at the opposite pole to the intuitive. Unfortunately, I cannot here take up the interesting variations which the extraverted or introverted attitude produces in non-rational types.","This is the common source of the illusion that one is then in possession of the thing itself. But actually one has acquired nothing more than its name, despite the age-old prejudice that the name magically represents the thing, and that it is sufficient to pronounce the name in order to posit the thing\'s existence. In the course of the millennia the reasoning mind has been given every opportunity to see through the futility of this conceit, though that has done nothing to prevent the intellectual mastery of a thing from being accepted at its face value. It is precisely our experiences in psychology which demonstrate as plainly as could be wished that the intellectual \\"grasp\\" of a psychological fact produces no more than a concept of it, and that a concept is no more than a name, a flatus vocis. These intellectual counters can be bandied about easily enough. They pass lightly from hand to hand, for they have no weight or substance. They sound full but are hollow; and though purporting to designate a heavy task and obligation, they commit us to nothing. The intellect is undeniably useful in its own field, but is a great cheat and illusionist outside of it.","I only know there is no point in wishing to know more of the collective unconscious than one gets through dreams and intuition. The more you know of it, the greater and heavier becomes your moral burden, because the unconscious contents transform themselves into your individual tasks and duties as soon as they begin to become conscious. Do you want to find more and more complications and increasing responsibilities?","What, then, shall we say to our patient with the imaginary cancer? I would tell him: \u201cYes, my friend, you are really suffering from a cancer-like thing, you really do harbour in yourself a deadly evil. However, it will not kill your body, because it is imaginary. But it will eventually kill your soul. It has already spoilt and even poisoned your human relations and your personal happiness and it will go on growing until it has swallowed your whole psychic existence. So that in the end you will not be a human being any more, but an evil destructive tumour.","Instead, I prefer to add a word about the effects regularly produced upon the other functions when preference is given to one. We know that a man can never be everything at once, never complete; he always develops certain qualities at the expense of others, and wholeness is never attained. But what happens to those functions which are not developed by exercise and are not consciously brought into daily use? They remain in a more or less primitive and infantile state, often only half-conscious, or even quite unconscious.","The increasing dependence on the State is anything but a healthy symptom, it means that the whole nation is in a fair way to becoming a herd of sheep, constantly relying on a shepherd to drive them into good pastures. The shepherd\u2019s staff soon becomes a rod of iron, and the shepherds turn into wolves. . . Any man who still possesses the instinct of self-preservation knows perfectly well that only a swindler would relieve him of responsibility. . .[those] who promise everything are sure to fulfil nothing, and everyone who promises too much is in danger of using evil means in order to carry out his promises. . .","It seems to me that, side by side with the decline of religious life, theneuroses grow noticeably more frequent. There are as yet no statistics withactual figures to prove this increase. But of one thing I am sure, thateverywhere the mental state of European man shows an alarming lack ofbalance. We are living undeniably in a period of the greatest restlessness,nervous tension, confusion, and disorientation of outlook. Among mypatients from many countries, all of them educated persons, there is aconsiderable number who came to see me not because they were sufferingfrom a neurosis but because they could find no meaning in their lives orwere torturing themselves with questions which neither our philosophy norour religion could answer. Some of them perhaps thought I knew of amagic formula, but I soon had to tell them that I didn\u2019t know the answereither. And this brings us to practical considerations.","The mass crushes out the insight and reflection that are still possible with the individual, and this necessarily leads to doctrinaire and authoritarian tyranny if ever the constitutional State should succumb to a fit of weakness.","There were things in the images which concerned not only myself but many others also. It was then that I ceased to belong to myself alone,","I myself recently dreamed that a UFO came speeding towards me which turned out to be the lens of a magic lantern whose projected image was myself; this suggested to me that I was the figure, himself deep in meditation, who is produced by a meditating yogi.","He: \\"I mean, are you happy and are you fully alive?\\"I laughed: \'\'As you can see, you wove witty jokes into the lecture to please your listeners. You heaped up learned expressions to impress them. You were restless and hasty, as if still compelled to snatch up all knowledge. You are not in yourself\\"Although these words at first seemed laughable to me, they still made an impression on me, and reluctantly I had to / credit the old man, since he was right.Then he said: \\"Dear Ammonius, I have delightful tidings for you: God has become flesh in his son and has brought us all salvation.\\" \\"\\"What are you saying,\\" I called, \\"you probably mean Osiris, who shall appear in the mortal body?\\"\\"No,\\" he replied, \\"this man lived in Judea and was born from a virgin.\\"I laughed and answered: \\"I already know about this; a Jewish trader has brought tidings of our virgin queen to Judea, whose image appears on the walls of one of our temples, and reported it as a fairy tale.\\"\\"No,\\" the old man insisted, \\"he was the Son of God.\\"\\"Then you mean Horus the son of Osiris, don\'t you?\\" I answered.\\"No,hewasnotHorus,butarealman,andhewashung from a cross.\\"\\"Oh, but this must be Seth, surely; whose punishments our old ones have often described.\\"But the old man stood by his conviction and said: \\"He died and rose up on the third day.\\"\\"Well, then he must be Osiris,\\" I replied impatiently. \\"No,\\" he cried, \\"he is called Jesus the anointed one.\\" \'\'Ah, you really mean this Jewish God, whom the poorhonor at the harbor, and whose unclean mysteries they celebrate in cellars.\\"\\"He was a man and yet the Son of God,\\" said the old man staring at me intently.\\"That\'s nonsense, dear old man,\\" I said, and showed him to the door. But like an echo from distant rock faces the words returned to me: a man and yet the Son of God. It seemed significant to me, and this phrase was what brought me to Christianity.I: \\"But don\'t you think that Christianity could ultimately be atransformation ofyour Egyptian teachings?\\"A: \\"If you say that our old teachings were less adequateexpressions of Christianity, then I\'m more likely to agree with you.\\" I: \\"Yes, but do you then assume that the history of religions isaimed at a final goal?\\"A: \\"My father once bought a black slave at the market from theregion of the source of the Nile. He came from a country that had heard ofneither Osiris nor the other Gods; he told me many things in a more simple language that said the same as we believed about Osiris and the other Gods. I learned to understand that those uneducated Negroes unknowingly already possessed most of what the religions of the cultured peoples had developed into complete doctrines. Those able to read that language correctly could thus recognize in it not only the pagan doctrines but also the doctrine of Jesus. And it\'s with this that I now occupy myself I read the gospels and seek their meaning which is yet to come.We know their meaning as it lies before us, but not their hidden meaning which points to the future. It\'s erroneous to believe that religions differ in their innermost essence. Strictly speaking, it\'s always one and the same religion. Every subsequent form of religion is the meaning of the antecedent.\\"I: \\"Have you found out the meaning which is yet to come?\\" A: \\"No, not yet; it\'s very difficult, but I hope I\'ll succeed. Sometimes it seems to me that I need the stimulation of others,but I realize that those are temptations of Satan.\\"I: \\"Don\'t you believe that you\'d succeed ifyou were nearer men?\\"A: \\"maybeyoureright.\\"He looks at me suddenly as if doubtful and suspicious. \\"But, I love the desert, do you understand? This yellow, sun-glowing desert. Here you can see the countenance of the sun every day; you are alone, you can see glorious Helios-no, that is- pagan-what\'s wrong with me? I\'m confused-you are Satan- I recognize you-give way; adversary!\\" He jumps up incensed and wants to lunge at me. But I am far away in the twentieth century.","Envy, lust, sensuality, lies, and all known vices are the negative, \u201cdark aspect of the unconscious, which can manifest itself in two ways. In the positive sense, it appears as a \u201cspirit of nature,\u201d creatively animating man, things, and the world. It is the \u201cchthonic spirit\u201d that has been mentioned so often in this chapter. In the negative sense, the unconscious (that same spirit) manifests itself as a spirit of evil, as a drive to destroy. As has already been pointed out, the alchemists personified this spirit as \u201cthe spirit Mercurius\u201d and called it, with good reason, Mercurius duplex (the two-faced, dual Mercurius). In the religious language of Christianity, it is called the devil. But, however improbable it may seem, the devil too has a dual aspect. In the positive sense, he appears as Lucifer\u2014literally, the light-bringer.\u201d","We should not try to \u201cget rid of a neurosis, but rather to experience what it means, what it has to teach, what its purpose is.\u201d","From then on, my life belonged to the generality.","...existe la posibilidad de que los n\xfameros fueran encontrados o descubiertos.

On the one hand, they rely on sampling techniques that reveal the trend of \u201copinion or \u201cwants\u201d\u2014that is, of collective attitudes. On the other, they express the prejudices, projections, and unconscious complexes (mainly the power complex) of those who manipulate public opinion. But statistics do no justice to the individual. Although the average size of stones in a heap may be five centimeters, one will find very few stones of exactly this size in the heap.\u201d","There is one more point to be made. The spirit of the age is in constant movement. It is like a river that flows on, invisibly but surely, and given the momentum of life in our century, even 10 years is a long time.","The dream says that underneath the cathedral there is a mysterious place, which in reality is not in tune with a Christian church. What is beneath a cathedral of that age? There is always the so-called under-church or crypt. You have probably seen the great crypt at Chartres; it gives a very good idea of the mysterious character of a crypt. The crypt at Chartres was previously an old sanctuary with a well, where the worship of a virgin was celebrated - not of the Virgin Mary, as is done now - but of a Celtic goddess. Under every Christian church of the Middle Ages there is a secret place where in old times the mysteries were celebrated......the serpent is not only the god of healing; it also has the quality of wisdom and prophecy.","try to plant the results of my experience in the soil of reality;","A Tibetan abbot once told Dr. Jung that the most impressive mandalas in Tibet are built up by imagination, or directed fantasy, when the psychological balance of the group is disturbed or when a particular thought cannot be rendered because it is not yet contained in the sacred doctrine and must therefore be searched for. In these remarks, two equally important basic aspects of mandala symbolism emerge. The mandala serves a conservative purpose\u2014namely, to restore a previously existing order. But it also serves the creative purpose of giving expression and form to something that does not yet exist, something new and unique. The second aspect is perhaps even more important than the first, but does not contradict it. For, in most cases, what restores the old order simultaneously involves some element of new creation. In the new order the older pattern returns on a higher level. The process is that of the ascending spiral, which grows upward while simultaneously returning again and again to the same point.","And of course if you ill-treat the body, it can throw you out of the house entirely, out of your body. It is like ill-treating objects. You know, objects are inanimate things; they lie about heavily, have no legs or wings, and people are often quite impatient with them. For instance, this book would like it very much better, I am sure, if it were lying near the center of the table where it is safe, but I have put it on the edge. It is an awkward position for that poor creature of a book. It may fall down and get injured. If I am impatient, if I touch them in an awkward way, it is a lamentable plight for the poor objects. Then they take their revenge on me. Because I illtreat them they turn against me and become contradictory in a peculiar way. I say, \\"Oh, these damned objects, dead things, despicable!\\"- and instantly they take on life. They begin to behave as if they were animated living things. You will then observe what the German philosopher tells about the die T\xfccke des Objekts. And the more you curse them, the more you use speech figures which insinuate life into them. For instance, \\"Where has that book hidden itself now?

Two Volumes: 1-2, unabridged (Jung Seminars) (p. 351-352)","In constructing a theory which derives the neurosis from causes in the distant past, we are first and foremost following the tendency of our patient to lure us as far away as possible from the critical present\u2026It is mainly in the present that the affective causes lie, and here alone are the possibilities of removing them.","When religious symbols that are partly different from those we know emerge from the unconscious of an individual, it is often feared that these will wrongfully alter or diminish the officially recognized religious symbols. This fear even causes many people to reject analytical psychology and the entire unconscious.","\xabNada os salva de lo desordenado y lo carente de sentido, pues \xe9sta es la otra mitad del mundo.\xbb","It makes no difference that there were already conflicts in childhood, for the conflicts in childhood are different from the conflict of adults. Those who have suffered ever since childhood from a chronic neurosis do not suffer now from the same conflict they suffered from then.","A psychoneurosis must be understood, ultimately, as the suffering of a soul which has not discovered its meaning. But all creativeness in the realm of the spirit as well as every psychic advance of man arises from the suffering of the soul, and the cause of the suffering is spiritual stagnation, or psychic sterility.","Naturally, at first, one is inclined to regard such differences as mere individual idiosyncrasies. But anyone with the opportunity of gaining a fundamental knowledge of many men will soon discover that such a far-reaching contrast does not merely concern the individual case, but is a question of typical attitudes, with a universality far greater than a limited psychological experience would at first assume. In reality, as the preceding chapters will have shown, it is a question of a fundamental opposition; at times clear and at times obscure, but always emerging whenever we are dealing with individuals whose personality is in any way pronounced. Such men are found not only among the educated classes, but in every rank of society; with equal distinctness, therefore, our types can be demonstrated among labourers and peasants as among the most differentiated members of a nation. Furthermore, these types over-ride the distinctions of sex, since one finds the same contrasts amongst women of all classes. Such a universal distribution could hardly arise at the instigation of consciousness, ie. as the result of a conscious and deliberate choice of attitude. If this were the case, a definite level of society, linked together by a similar education and environment and, therefore, correspondingly localized, would surely have a majority representation of such an attitude. But the actual facts are just the reverse, for the types have, apparently, quite a random distribution. In the same family one child is introverted, and another extraverted.","There are as many archetypes as there are typical situations in life. Endless repetition has engraved these experiences into our psychic constitution, not in the form of images filled with content, but at first only as forms without content, representing merely the possibility of a certain type of perception and action. When a situation occurs which corresponds to a given archetype, that archetype becomes activated and a compulsiveness appears, which, like an instinctual drive, gains its way against all reason and will, or else produces a conflict of pathological dimensions, that is to say, a neurosis.","For that matter, does a thing or a fact ever mean anything in and of itself? We can only be sure that it is always the human being who interprets, that is, gives meaning to a fact. And that is the gist of the matter for psychology.","Only when it comes to explaining psychic phenomena of a minimal degree of clarity are we driven to assume that archetypes must have a nonpsychic aspect. Grounds for such a conclusion are supplied by the phenomena of synchronicity, which are associated with the activity of unconscious operators and have hitherto been regarded, or repudiated, as \'telepathy\' etc. Scepticism should, however, be levelled only at incorrect theories and not at facts which exist in their own right. No unbiased observer can deny them. Resistance to the recognition of such facts rests principally on the repugnance people feel for an allegedly supernatural faculty tacked on to the psyche, like \'clairvoyance\'. The very diverse and confusing aspects of these phenomena are, so far as I can see at present, completely explicable on the assumption of psychically relative space-time continuum. As soon as the psychic content crosses the threshold of consciousness, the synchronistic marginal phenomena disappear, time and space resume their accustomed sway, and consciousness is once more isolated in its subjectivity. We have here one of those instances which can best be understood in terms of the physicist\'s idea of \'complementarity\'. When an unconscious content passes over into consciousness its synchronistic manifestation ceases; conversely, synchronistic phenomena can be evoked by putting the subject into an unconscious state (trance).","If I recognize only nat- uralistic values, and explain everything in physical terms, I shall depreciate, hinder, or even destroy the spiritual development of my patients. And if I hold exclusively to a spiritual interpretation, then I shall misunderstand and do violence to the nat- ural man in his right to exist as a physical being.","I am the true medicine [says Wisdom], correcting and transmuting that which is no longer into that which it was before its corruption, and that which is not into that which it ought to be. * (Ibid., p. 459).\u201d","to profane those inexpressible feelings with stale sentimentalities.","that is, towards the unconscious, the only available source of religious experience.","This, one suspects, may have been the reason which moved John to assimilate the newborn man-child to the figure of the avenger, thereby blurring his mythological character as the lovely and lovable divine youth whom we know so well in the figures of Tammuz, Adonis, and Balder. The enchanting springlike beauty of this divine youth is one of those pagan values which we miss so sorely in Christianity, and particularly in the sombre world of the apocalypse\u2014the indescribable morning glory of a day in spring, which after the deathly stillness of winter causes the earth to put forth and blossom, gladdens the heart of man and makes him believe in a kind and loving God.","[we] have a mighty dislike of all intentional effort and are addicted to absolute laziness until circumstances prod [us] into action.","If, in doing this I should open the door to so-called \\"suggestion\\", I see no occasion for regret; it is well known that we are susceptible only to those suggestions with which we are already secretly in accord.","Psychic projection is one of the commonest facts of psychology. It is the same as that participation mystique which L\xe9vy-Br\xfchl remarked as a peculiar trait of primitive man. We merely give it another name, and as a rule deny that we are guilty of it. Everything that is unconscious in ourselves we discover in our neighbour, and we treat him accordingly. We no longer subject him to the test of drinking poison; we do not burn him or put the screws on him; but we injure him by means of moral verdicts pronounced with the deepest conviction. What we combat in him is usually our own inferior side.","whereby the planetary spirits who are needed in order to unite the spirit or soul with the body, and to transform the latter, are compelled to descend","No harm is done if now and then one goes astray in this riddle-reading.

Hence, for the individual to enter seriously into the process of individuation in the way that has been outlined means a completely new and different orientation toward life. For scientists it also means a new and different scientific approach to outer facts. How this will work out in the field of human knowledge and in the social life of human beings cannot be predicted. But to me it seems certain that Jung\u2019s discovery of the process of individuation is a fact that future generations will have to take into account if they want to avoid drifting into a stagnant or even regressive outlook.","labyrinths.

Let us not forget, in this connection, that what the Christian sacrament of baptism purports to do is of the greatest importance for the psychic development of mankind. Baptism endows the human being with a unique soul. I do not mean, of course, the baptismal rite in itself as a magical act that is effective at one performance. I mean that the idea of baptism lifts a man out of his archaic identification with the world and changes him into a being who stands above it. The fact that mankind has risen to the level of this idea is baptism in the deepest sense, for it means the birth of spiritual man who transcends nature. It","Virtually everything depends on the human psyche and its functions.

It needs only an almost imperceptible disturbance of equilibrium in a few of our rulers\u2019 heads to plunge the world into blood, fire, and radioactivity.","I do not think that I underestimate the risk of this undertaking.

The supreme danger which threatens individuals as well as whole nations is a psychic danger. Reason has proved itself completely powerless, precisely because its arguments have an effect only on the conscious mind and not on the unconscious. The greatest danger of all comes from the masses, in whom the effects of the unconscious pile up cumulatively and the reasonableness of the conscious mind is stifled. Every mass organization is a latent danger just as much as a heap of dynamite is. It lets loose effects which no man wants and no man can stop. It is therefore in the highest degree desirable that a knowledge of psychology should spread so that men can understand the source of the supreme dangers that threaten them. Not by arming to the teeth, each for itself, can the nations defend themselves in the long run from the frightful catastrophes of modern war. The heaping up of arms is itself a call to war. Rather must they recognize those psychic conditions under which the unconscious [tsunami-like] bursts the dykes of consciousness and overwhelms it.","Identific\u0103rile cu un rol social sunt \xeen genere o surs\u0103 bogat\u0103 de nevroze.

The child is the being which matures toward independence, and it accomplishes this through voluntary separation from the mother archetype \u2013 the psychological symbol of familiarity and protection \u2013 and subsequent exploration of nature and/or the unknown. Said separation is spurred by a conflict which is unresolvable by current conscious means, which is why the child must abandon the infantilizing safety of the mother so that he can enter the unknown and retrieve or receive the wisdom necessary for the heroic transformation necessary to resolve the previously unresolvable conflict.","From the psychological point of view, primitive man\'s belief that the arbitrary power of chance answers to the intentions of spirits and of sorcerers is perfectly natural, because it is an unavoidable inference from the facts as he sees them.

Think of the blond savage of the German forests, who had to betray the hammer-brandishing thunder to the pale Near Eastern god who was nailed to the wood like a chicken marten.

But their life force bade them to go on living, and they betrayed their beautiful wild Gods, their holy trees and their awe of the German forests.","My friend Mountain Lake, a Pueblo chief, once called me sharply to account because I had given voice to the Augustinian tenet: Non est hic sol Dominus noster, sed qui illum fecit. Pointing to the sun, he declared indignantly: \\"He who goes there is our father. You can see him. From him comes all light, all life\u2014there is nothing that he has not made.\\" He became greatly excited, struggled for words, and finally exclaimed: \\"Even a man in the mountains who goes alone cannot make his fire without him.\\" The archaic standpoint can hardly be more beautifully expressed than by these words. The power that rules us comes from the external world, and through it alone are we permitted to live. With us, religious thought still keeps alive the archaic state of mind, even though our time is bereft of gods. Untold millions of people still think in this way.","From time immemorial, men have had ideas about a Supreme Being (one or several) and about the Land of the Hereafter.

What right have we then to depreciate imagination? In the ordinary course of things, fantasy does not easily go astray; it is too deep for that, and too closely bound up with the tap-root of human and animal instinct. In surprising ways it always rights itself again. The creative activity of the imagination frees man from his bondage to the \\"nothing but\\" and liberates in him the spirit of play. As Schiller says, man is completely human only when he is playing.","Superstition and perversity are after all one and the same. They are transitional or embryonic stages from which new and riper forms will emerge.","Every man carries within him the eternal image of woman, not the image of this or that particular woman, but a definite feminine image. The image is fundamentally unconscious, an hereditary factor of primordial origin engraved in the living organic system of the man, an imprint or \\"archetype\\" of all the ancestral experiences of the female, a deposit, as it were, of all the impressions ever made by woman\u2014in short, an inherited system of psychic adaptation. Even if no women existed, it would still be possible, at any given time, to deduce from this unconscious image exactly how a woman would have to be constituted psychically.","Thoughts are natural events that you do not possess, and whose meaning you only imperfectly recognize.","In this book I have devoted considerable space to my subjective view of the world, which, however, is not a product of rational thinking. It is rather a vision such as will come to one who undertakes, deliberately, with half-closed eyes and somewhat closed ears, to see and hear the form and voice of being. If our impressions are too distinct, we are held to the hour and minute of the present and have no way of knowing how our ancestral psyches listen to and understand the present\u2014in other words, how our unconscious is responding to it. Thus we remain ignorant of whether our ancestral components find an elementary gratification in our lives, or whether they are repelled. Inner peace and contentment depend in large measure upon whether or not the historical family which is inherent in the individual can be harmonized with the ephemeral conditions of the present.","Our famous scientific reality does not afford us the slightest protection against the so-called irreality of the unconscious. Something works behind the veil of fantastic images, whether we give this something a good name or a bad. It is something real, and for this reason its manifestations must be taken seriously. But first the tendency to concretization must be overcome; in other words, we must not take the fantasies literally when we approach the question of interpreting them. While we are in the grip of the actual experience, the fantasies cannot be taken literally enough.","Mind is not born as a tabula rasa. Like the body, it has its pre-established individual definiteness; namely, forms of behavior. They become manifest in the ever-recurring patterns of psychic functioning.","In coming to a close after so many bold assertions, I would like to return to the promise made at the outset to be mindful of the need for moderation and caution. Indeed, I do not forget that my voice is but one voice, my experience a mere drop in the sea, my knowledge no greater than the visual field in a microscope, my mind\'s eye a mirror that reflects a small corner of the world, and my ideas\u2014a subjective confession.","Aquilo que voc\xea resiste, persiste.","From the unconscious there emanate determining influences\u2026which, independently of tradition, guarantee in every single individual a similarity and even a sameness of experience, and also of the way it is represented imaginatively.","If you feel an overwhelming rage coming up in you when a friend reproaches you about a fault, you can be fairly sure that at this point you will find a part of your shadow, of which you are unconscious.","So far we can easily follow this primitive idea. The difficulty arises when we try to carry its implications further, for they reverse the process of psychic projection of which I have spoken. These implications are as follows: it is not my imagination or my awe that makes a sorcerer of the medicine-man; on the contrary, he is a sorcerer and projects his magical powers upon me. Ghosts are not hallucinations of my mind, but appear to me of their own volition. Although such statements are logical derivatives of the mana idea, we hesitate to accept them and begin to look around us for our comfortable theory of psychic projection. The question is nothing less than this: does the psychic in general\u2014that is, the spirit, or the unconscious\u2014arise in us; or is the psyche, in the early stages of consciousness, actually outside us in the form of arbitrary powers with intentions of their own, and does it gradually come to take its place within us in the course of psychic development? Were the dissociated psychic contents\u2014to use our modern terms\u2014ever parts of the psyches of individuals, or were they rather from the beginning psychic entities existing in themselves according to the primitive view as ghosts, ancestral spirits and the like? Were they only by degrees embodied by man in the course of development, so that they gradually constituted in him that world which we now call the psyche?","The modern man has lost all the metaphysical certainties of his medi\xe6val brother, and set up in their place the ideals of material security, general welfare and humaneness.","Her attitude toward me was above all one of admiration, and that was not good for me.","My aim is to bring about a psychic state in which my patient begins to experiment with his own nature\u2014a state of fluidity, change and growth, in which there is no longer anything eternally fixed and hopelessly petrified.","This whole idea strikes us as dangerously paradoxical, and yet we are able to conceive something of the kind. Not only the religious teacher, but the pedagogue as well, assumes that it is possible to implant in the human psyche something that was not previously there. The power of suggestion and influence is a fact; even the most modern behaviourism expects far-reaching results from this quarter. The idea of a complicated building-up of the psyche is expressed in primitive form in many widespread beliefs\u2014for instance, possession, the incarnation of ancestral spirits, the immigration of souls, and so forth. When someone sneezes, we still say: \\"God bless you\\", and mean by it: \\"I hope your new soul will do you no harm.\\" When in the course of our own development we grow out of many-sided contradictions and achieve a unified personality, we experience something like a complicated growing-together of the psyche. Since the human body is built up by inheritance out of a number of Mendelian units, it does not seem altogether out of the question that the human psyche is similarly put together.","As long as this system gives true expression to life, psychology can be nothing but a technical adjuvant to healthy living, and the psyche cannot be regarded as a problem in itself. While man still lives as a herd-being he has no \\"things of the spirit\\" of his own; nor does he need any, save the usual belief in the immortality of the soul. But as soon as he has outgrown whatever local form of religion he was born to - as soon as this religion can no longer embrace his life in all its fullness - then the psyche becomes something in its own right which cannot be dealt with by the measures of the Church alone.","The psychologist of today ought to realize once and for all that we are no longer dealing with questions of dogma and creed. A religious attitude is an element in psychic life whose importance can hardly be overrated. And it is precisely for the religious outlook that the sense of historical continuity is indispensable.","The materialistic views of our day have a tendency which we can discern in archaic thought. Both lead to the conclusion that the individual is a mere resultant; in the first case, he is the resultant of natural causes, and in the second, of chance occurrences. According to both accounts, human individuality is nothing in its own right, but rather the accidental product of forces contained in the objective environment. This is through and through the archaic conception of the world according to which the single human being is never considered unique, but always interchangeable with any other and easily dispensable. By way of a narrow view of causality, modern materialism has returned to the standpoint of archaic man. But the materialist is more radical, because he is more systematic, than primitive man. The latter has the advantage of being inconsistent; he makes an exception of the mana personality. In the course of history these mana personalities were exalted to the position of divine figures; they became heroes and kings who shared in the immortality of the gods by eating of their rejuvenating food. This idea of the immortality of the individual and of his imperishable worth is to be found in primitive societies, first of all in the belief in ghosts, and then in myths of the age when death had not yet gained an entrance into the world through human carelessness or folly.","The individual who is not anchored in God can offer no resistance on his own resources to the physical and moral blandishments of the world.","A mag\xe1nyoss\xe1g nem \xfagy j\xf6n l\xe9tre, hogy senki nincs k\xf6r\xfcl\xf6tt\xfcnk, hanem sokkal ink\xe1bb az\xe1ltal, hogy senkivel nem lehet megbesz\xe9lni olyan dolgokat, amelyeket fontosnak \xe9rz\xfcnk, vagy hogy az ember \xe9rv\xe9nyesnek tekint olyan gondolatokat, amelyeket a t\xf6bbiek val\xf3sz\xedn\u0171tlennek tartanak.","(it may prove to be that \u201cpsyche and \u201cmatter\u201d are actually the same phenomenon, one observed from \u201cwithin\u201d and the other from \u201cwithout\u201d),\u201d","Truth to tell, I have a very high opinion of fantasy. To me, it is actually the maternal creative side of the masculine spirit. When all is said and done, we are never proof against fantasy. It is true that there are worthless, inadequate, morbid and unsatisfying fantasies whose sterile nature will be quickly recognized by every person endowed with common-sense; but this of course proves nothing against the value of creative imagination. All the works of man have their origin in creative fantasy. What right have we then to depreciate imagination? In the ordinary, course of things, fantasy does not easily go astray; it is too deep for that, and too closely bound up with the tap-root of human and animal instinct. In surprising ways it always rights itself again. The creative activity of the imagination frees man from his bondage to \\"nothing but\\" and liberates in him the spirit of play. As Schiller says, man is completely human only when he is playing.","Ao observar a via de desenvolvimento daqueles que silenciosamente e como que inconscientemente se superavam a si mesmos, constatei que seus destinos tinham algo em comum: o novo vinha a eles do campo obscuro das possibilidades de fora ou de dentro, e eles o acolhiam e com isso cresciam. Parecia-me t\xedpico que uns o recebessem de fora e outros, de dentro, ou melhor, que em alguns o novo crescesse a partir de fora e em outros, a partir de dentro. Mas de qualquer forma, nunca o novo era algo somente exterior ou somente interior. Ao vir de fora, tornava-se a viv\xeancia mais \xedntima. Vindo de dentro, tornava-se acontecimento externo.

The artist is not a person endowed with free will who seeks his own ends, but one who allows art to realize its purposes through him.","What most people overlook or seem unable to understand is the fact that I regard the psyche as real.","The spirit of evil is fear, negation, the adversary who opposes life in its struggle for eternal duration and thwarts every great deed, who infuses into the body the poison of weakness and age through the treacherous bite of the serpent; he is the spirit of regression, who threatens us with bondage to the mother and with dissolution and extinction in the unconscious. For the hero, fear is a challenge and a task, because only boldness can deliver from fear. And if the risk is not taken, the meaning of life is somehow violated.","Uno mira hacia atr\xe1s con agradecimiento a los maestros brillantes, pero con gratitud a aquellos que tocaron nuestros sentimientos humanos.

That would be the necessity and the indispensable condition if there were any question of perfection at all. For how can you perfect a thing if it is not complete?","To provide an example of the types of symbols which are manifested by the archetypes we will look at the archetype Jung called the Self. The Self is the central archetype and its role is in unifying the other archetypal structures of the psyche. According to Jung, the importance of the Self archetype coincides with the fact that it is the source of many of the symbols found in religions and myths.","The phenomenon we have witnessed in Germany was nothing less than [an] outbreak of epidemic insanity. . . No one knew what was happening to him, least of all of the Germans, who allowed themselves to be driven to the slaughterhouse by their leading psychopaths like hypnotized sheep.","It is, unfortunately, only too clear that if the individual is not truly regenerated in spirit, society cannot be either, for society is the sum total of the individuals in need of redemption.","Psychologically you develop in a spiral, you always come over the same point where you have been before, but it is never exactly the same, it is either above or below. A patient will say, \'I am just at the place where I was three years ago,\' but I say, \'At least you have travelled three years.","As for the relatively fixed symbols, this example gives a fair idea of their general nature. There are a great many of them, and they may differ in individual cases by subtle shifts of meaning. It is only through comparative studies in mythology, folk-lore, religion and language that we can determine these symbols in a scientific way. The evolutionary stages through which the human psyche has passed are more clearly discernible in the dream than in consciousness. The dream speaks in images, and gives expression to instincts, that are derived from the most primitive levels of nature. Consciousness all too easily departs from the law of nature; but it can be brought again into harmony with the latter by the assimilation of unconscious contents. By fostering this process we lead the patient to the rediscovery of the law of his own being.","The Lingam is certainly not an obscene allusion; nor is the cross merely a sign of death. Much depends upon the maturity of the dreamer who produces such an image.","An intelligent man will make his adaptation to the world through his intelligence, and not in the manner of a sixth-rate pugilist, even though now and then, in a fit of rage, he may make use of his fists. In the struggle for existence and adaptation everyone instinctively uses his most developed function, which thus becomes the criterion of his habitual reactions.","Ale \u017e\xe1dn\xfd vysoko vzrostl\xfd, vzne\u0161en\xfd strom se je\u0161t\u011b nikdy nevzdal sv\xfdch temn\xfdch ko\u0159en\u016f.

It cannot be turned into a mechanical system and then crammed into unimaginative brains. It demands both an increasing knowledge of the dreamer\u2019s individuality and an increasing self-awareness on the part of the interpreter","Here each of us must ask: Have I any religious experience and immediate relation to God, and hence that certainty which will keep me, as an individual, from dissolving int he crowd?","To be a particle in a mass has meaning and charm only for the man who has not yet advanced to that stage, but none for the man who has experienced it to satiety. The importance of individual life may always be denied by the \\"educator\\" whose pride it is to breed mass-men. But any other person will sooner or later be driven to find this meaning for himself.","Make it complete first and see what it is then. But to make it complete is already a mountain of a task, and by the time you arrive at absolute completion, you find that you are already dead, so you never reach that preliminary condition for perfecting yourself.","It looks here as if Nietzsche shared the belief of his time, a materialistic conviction that other worlds-metaphysical matters-have no existence except in the imagination of man. He is paying a tribute to his age, not seeing what the imagination of man really means. When anybody says a thing is merely imagination, he is really saying something quite formidable; for whatever our imagination may be, that is our world, unfortunately. [...] For any imagination is a potentiality. The chair upon which I am sitting and the house in which I am, have once been the imagination of a builder; first he made a drawing of it and then he built this house, and if it comes down on my head I shall be crushed. There is nothing in our civilized world which has not been imagination. So imaginations are potential realities, exactly like a loaded revolver, a shot that has not gone off yet; but some ass might pull the trigger and I would be dead. [...] I am certain, for instance, that the primitives live in an entirely different world from ours; we assume that it is the same, but that is by no means true. They have different impressions, different imaginations about it; it functions in an entirely different way.Jung, C. G.. Nietzsche\'s Zarathustra: Notes of the Seminar given in 1934-1939. Two Volumes: 1-2, unabridged (Jung Seminars) (p. 341)","It is highly important for a young person who is still unadapted and has as yet achieved nothing, to shape the conscious ego as effectively as possible\u2014that is, to educate the will. Unless he is positively a genius he even may not believe in anything active within himself that is not identical with his will. He must feel himself a man of will, and he may safely depreciate everything else within himself or suppose it subject to his will\u2014for without this illusion he can scarcely bring about a social adaptation.","No experienced worker in this field will deny that there are rules of thumb that can prove helpful, but they must be applied with prudence and intelligence. One may follow all the right rules and yet get bogged down in the most appalling nonsense, simply by overlooking a seemingly unimportant detail that a better intelligence would not have missed. Even a man of high intellect can go badly astray for lack of intuition or feeling.","Even if, juristically speaking, we are not accessories to the crime, we are always, thanks to our human nature, potential criminals. In reality we merely lacked a suitable opportunity to be drawn into the infernal melee.","O func\u021bionare incorect\u0103 a psihicului poate d\u0103una \xeen mare m\u0103sur\u0103 corpului, dup\u0103 cum, invers, o suferin\u021b\u0103 fizic\u0103 poate s\u0103 atrag\u0103 participarea la suferin\u021b\u0103 a sufletului; c\u0103ci sufletul \u0219i corpul nu sunt ceva separat, ci sunt mai degrab\u0103 una \u0219i aceea\u0219i via\u021b\u0103.

How divinely do vault and arch here contrast in the struggle: how with light and shade they strive against each other, the divinely striving ones. \u2014 This is a clear description of the Gothic cathedral where you really feel that life itself has become congealed-one could say it was congealed life. It is often compared to a wood or to the branches of a tree; all sorts of animals run up and down those columns and spires. It is wood that has become stone, or spirit that has become incorruptible matter, and the architecture symbolizes the struggle from which it arose. One sees the struggle itself represented in Norman art, in those manifold representations of the fight between man and monsters, particularly. In the Gothic cathedral this conflict is fully developed and fully represented in the enormous height and depth, in the light and the shadow, and in the extraordinary complication of all those architectural forms melting into each other, or fighting one another. It is also expressed in the peculiar arches built outside the church to support the walls inside; it gives one the idea of tremendous tension, of a thing that is almost bursting. When you look, for instance, in Notre Dame in Paris, at the tension of the walls inside supported by the arches, you realize how daring the whole enterprise was-to catch so much spirit in matterand what they had to do in order to secure it. There is no such thing in the Norman cathedrals; they are really made of stone, while in the Gothic cathedrals one begins to doubt the weight of the stone. And a little later one sees the same peculiarity in sculpture. In the cinquecento sculpture of Michelangelo and the later men, they seemed to deny the immobility of the stone; up to that time, stone had been practically immovable, even Greek sculpture, but with Michelangelo, the stone began to move with a surplus of life which is hardly believable. It seems as if it either were not stone or as if something wrong had happened. There is too much life, the stone seems to walk away. It begins to move till the whole thing falls asunder. You see, that is what Nietzsche is describing here. He calls them the divinely striving ones that are no longer striving; they have congealed, they have come to rest. Jung, C. G.. Nietzsche\'s Zarathustra: Notes of the Seminar given in 1934-1939. Two Volumes: 1-2, unabridged (Jung Seminars) (p. 1109-1110)","If a man imagined that I was his arch-enemy and killed me, I should be dead on account of mere imagination. Imaginary conditions do exist and they may be just as real and just as harmful or dangerous as physical conditions. I even believe that psychic disturbances are far more dangerous than epidemics [of physical disease] or earthquakes.","For an inwardly sound and self-confident person will be more adequate to his social tasks than one who is not on good terms with his unconscious.","This is certainly not to say that what we call the unconscious is identical with God or is set up in his place. It is simply the medium from which religious experience seems to flow. As to what the further cause of such experience may be, the answer to this lies beyond the range of human knowledge. Knowledge of God is a transcendental problem.","Jung identifies the \u201cAnthropos (\u201cPrimal Man\u201d or \u201cOriginal Man\u201d), \u201cChrist,\u201d and the \u201cSon\u201d with God. The Anthropos begins as part of the unconscious godhead, emerges as an independent ego, eventually forgets his unconscious origin, must be reminded of it by the godhead, and then returns to it to form a unified\u201d","For all my respect for history, it seems to me that no insight into the past and no re-experiencing of pathogenic reminiscences \u2013 however powerful it may be \u2013 is as effective in freeing man from the grip of the past as the construction of something new\u2026no matter what the original circumstances from which they arose, [the neurosis] is conditioned and maintained by a wrong attitude which is present all the time and which, once it is recognized, must be corrected now.","When we attempt to understand symbols, we are not only confronted with the symbol itself, but we are brought up against the wholeness of the symbol-producing individual. This includes a study of his cultural background, and in the process one fills in many gaps in one\u2019s own education. I have made it a rule myself to consider every case as an entirely new proposition about which I do not even know the ABC. Routine responses may be practical and useful while one is dealing with the surface, but as soon as one gets in touch with the vital problems, life itself takes over and even the most brilliant theoretical premises become ineffectual words.","A symbol does not disguise, it reveals in time.","Man\u2019s task is\u2026to become conscious of the contents that press upward from the unconscious. Neither should he persist in his unconsciousness nor remain identical with the unconscious elements of his being, thus evading his destiny, which is to create more and more consciousness. As far as we can discern, the sole purpose of human existence is to kindle a light in the darkness of mere being.","The enigmatic oneness of the living organism, has as its corollary the fact that bodily traits are not merely physical, nor mental traits merely psychic. The continuity of nature knows nothing of those antithetical distinctions which the human intellect is forced to set up as aids to understanding.","Synchronistic phenomena prove the simultaneous occurrence of meaningful equivalences in heterogeneous, causally unrelated processes; in other words, they prove that a content perceived by an observer can, at the same time, be represented by an outside event, without any causal connection. From this it follows either that the psyche cannot be localized in space, or that space is relative to the psyche. The same applies to the temporal determination of the psyche and the psychic relativity of time. I do not need to emphasize that the verification of these findings must have far-reaching consequences.","Even today Western man finds it hard to see the psychological necessity for a transcendental subject of cognition as the counter-pole of the empirical universe, although the postulate of a world-confronting self, at least as a point of reflection, is a logical necessity.","unified self. Misleadingly identifying the Demiurge with the Anthropos, Jung says: The primordial image of the quaternity coalesces, for the Gnostics, with the figure of the demiurge or Anthropos. He is, as it were, the victim of his own creative act, for, when he descended into Physis, he was caught in her embrace. The image of the anima mundi or Original Man latent in the dark of matter expresses the presence of a transconscious centre which, because of its quaternary character and its roundness, must be regarded as a symbol of wholeness.76","Aveam un prieten de studen\u0163ie, a c\u0103rui familie locuia la Schaffhausen.

I want to emphasize that I despise politics wholeheartedly: thus I am neither a Bolshevik, nor a National Socialist, nor an Anti-Semite. I am a neutral Swiss and even in my own country I am uninterested in politics, because I am convinced that 99 per cent of politics are mere symptoms and anything but a cure for social evils. About 50 per cent of politics is definitely obnoxious inasmuch as it poisons the utterly incompetent mind of the masses.

As Dr. Jung has shown in his chapter, it is consciousness that holds the key to the values of the unconscious, and that therefore plays the decisive part. Consciousness alone is competent to determine the meaning of the images and to recognize their significance for man here and now, in the concrete reality of the present. Only in an interplay of consciousness and the unconscious can the unconscious prove its value, and perhaps even show a way to overcome the melancholy of the void. If the unconscious, once in action, is left to itself, there is a risk that its contents will become overpowering or will manifest their negative, destructive side.","I early arrived at the insight that when no answer comes from within to the problems and complexities of life, they ultimately mean very little.","The meaning of my existence is that life has addressed a question to me. Or, conversely, I myself am a question...","The world is empty only to him who does not know how to direct his libido towards things and people, and to render them alive and beautiful.

But left to itself and without the human response from consciousness, it can (again like nature) destroy its own gifts and sooner or later sweep them into annihilation.","Not to put too fine a point on it, one could say that the real picture consists of nothing but exceptions to the rule, and that, in consequence, absolute reality has predominantly the character of irregularity.","It is our own repressed desires that stick like arrows in our flesh.","When dark figures turn up in our dreams and seem to want something, we cannot be sure whether they personify merely a shadowy part of ourselves, or the Self, or both at the same time. Divining in advance whether our dark partner symbolizes a shortcoming that we should overcome or a meaningful bit of life that we should accept\u2014this is one of the most difficult problems that we encounter on the way to individuation. Moreover, the dream symbols are often so subtle and complicated that one cannot be sure of their interpretation. In such a situation all one can do is accept the discomfort of ethical doubt\u2014making no final decisions or commitments and continuing to watch the dreams. This resembles the situation of Cinderella when her stepmother threw a heap of good and bad peas in front of her and asked her to sort them out. Although it seemed quite hopeless, Cinderella began patiently to sort the peas, and suddenly doves (or ants, in some versions) came to help her. These creatures symbolize helpful, deeply unconscious impulses that can only be felt in one\u2019s body, as it were, and that point to a way out.","These two archetypal principles lie at the foundation of the contrasting system of East and West. The masses and their leaders do not realize, however, that there is no substantial difference between calling the world principle male and a father (spirit), as the West does, or female and a mother (matter), as the Communists do. Essentially, we know as little of the one as of the other. In earlier times, these principles were worshiped in all sorts of rituals, which at least showed the psychic significance they held for man. But now they have become mere abstract concepts.","The individual, however, as an irrational datum, is the true and authentic carrier of reality, the concrete man as opposed to the unreal ideal or normal man to whom the scientific statements refer.","By nursing secret destructive attitudes, a wife can drive her husband, and a mother her children, into illness, accident, or even death. Or she may decide to keep the children from marrying\u2014a deeply hidden form of evil that rarely comes to the surface of the mother\u2019s conscious mind. (A na\xefve old woman once said to me, while showing me a picture of her son, who was drowned when he was 27: \u201cI prefer it this way; it\u2019s better than giving him away to another woman.)\u201d","Cada vez que um acontecimento numinoso faz vibrar fortemente a alma, h\xe1 o perigo de que se rompa o fio em que estamos suspensos.

John the Baptist and his school called Jeshu ben Miriam-the son of Miriam the deceiver, the traitor, because he had betrayed the mysteries; he became an individual, the son of God, and received immediate revelation, and that was an awful sin and the real cause of his death.It is an old Jewish tradition also that he betrayed the mysteries and so had to suffer the death of a traitor.In the literature of the Manichaeans, the disciples of John, there is a text containing a discussion between Christ and John the Baptist upon that question.They both presented very good arguments.Christ\'s very practical argument was: \'Do I not make the lame walk?Do I not restore sight to the blind?\'But John would not hear of that, he said that Christ betrayed the mysteries, he gave them out to the world, and that they would be destroyed by the world.And the world did destroy them.The projection of the Self belonged to the psychology of ancient times, when the chief or the king represented the whole people and had to suffer and to die for the people.Then another old rite played a certain role in the history of Christ; it is to a great extent legend, but legends are so true that they repeat themselves literally in reality, real events are like legends.","statistical reality is the only one, then that is the sole authority. There is then only one condition, and since no contrary condition exists, judgment and decision are not only superfluous but impossible.","The strength and inner clarity needed by the ego in order to make such a decision stem secretly from the Great Man, who apparently does not want to reveal himself too clearly. It may be that the Self wants the ego to make a free choice, or it may be that the Self depends on human consciousness and its decisions to help him to become manifest. When it comes to such difficult ethical problems, no one can truly judge the deeds of others. Each man has to look to his own problem and try to determine what is right for himself. As an old Zen Buddhist Master said, we must follow the example of the cowherd who watches his ox \u201cwith a stick so that it will not graze on other people\u2019s meadows.","No matter how isolated you are and how lonely you feel, if you do your work truly and conscientiously, unknown friends will come and seek you.","Man kann dem Christentum eine r\xfcckst\xe4ndige Entwicklung vorwerfen, wenn man das eigene Ungen\xfcgen entschuldigen will.

[...] Die Forderung der \\"imitatio\\" Christi, n\xe4mlich dem Vorbild nachzufolgen und diesem \xe4hnlich zu werden, sollte die Entwicklung und Erh\xf6hung des eigenen inneren Menschen bezwecken, wird aber von oberfl\xe4chlichen und zur mechanischen Formelhaftigkeit neigenden Gl\xe4ubigen zu einem au\xdfenstehenden Kultobjekt gemacht, welches gerade durch die Verehrung daran verhindert wird, in die Tiefe der Seele einzugreifen und letztere zu jener dem Vorbild entsprechenden Ganzheit umzuschaffen.","The state is a terrible concretization,but if such things begin to concretize it is the very devil, as Nietzsche feels [\u2026] But surely the state is not the word of God. It is the invention of the many and therefore dangerous and poisonous; it is a devilish invention replacing the eternal plan of God that should rule the world. It is man instead of the divine competence, the limited mind instead of the infinite mind, things based upon temporal assumptions instead of upon eternal verities.","If statistical reality is the only one, then that is the sole authority. There is then only one condition, and since no contrary condition exists, judgment and decision are not only superfluous but impossible. Then the individual is bound to be a function of statistics and hence a function of the State or whatever the abstract principle of order may be called.","Unfortunately, whenever one of these personifications of the unconscious takes possession of our mind, it seems as if we ourselves are having such thoughts and feelings. The ego identifies with them to the point where it is unable to detach them and see them for what they are. One is really \u201cpossessed by the figure from the unconscious. Only after the possession has fallen away does one realize with horror that one has said and done things diametrically opposed to one\u2019s real thoughts and feelings\u2014that one has been the prey of an alien psychic factor.\u201d","As the highest value and supreme dominant in the psychic hierarchy, the God-image is immediately related to, or identical with, the self, and everything that happens to the God-image has an effect on the latter. Any uncertainty about the God-image causes a profound uneasiness in the self, for which reason the question is generally ignored because of its painfulness. But that does not mean that it remains unasked in the unconscious.What is more, it is answered by views and beliefs like materialism, atheism, and similar substitutes, which spread like epidemics. They crop up wherever and whenever one waits in vain for the legitimate answer. The ersatz product represses the real question into the unconscious and destroys the continuity of historical tradition which is the hallmark of civilization. The result is bewilderment and confusion.","Dogma nen\xed sv\xe9voln\xfdm v\xfdmyslem ani jedine\u010dn\xfdm z\xe1zrakem, jak b\xfdv\xe1 l\xed\u010deno za z\u0159ejm\xfdm \xfa\u010delem jeho vyzvednut\xed z p\u0159\xedrodn\xedch souvislost\xed. \xdast\u0159edn\xed k\u0159es\u0165ansk\xe9 p\u0159edstavy tkv\xed sv\xfdmi ko\u0159eny v on\xe9 gnostick\xe9 filosofii, kter\xe1 se podle psychologick\xfdch z\xe1kon\u016f musela vyvinout pr\xe1v\u011b v dob\u011b, kdy se klasick\xe1 n\xe1bo\u017eenstv\xed st\xe1vala obsolentn\xedmi.

About a third of my cases are suffering from no clinically definable neurosis, but from the senselessness and emptiness of their lives. It seems to me, however, that this can well be described as the general neurosis of our time. Fully two-thirds of my patients have passed middle age. It is difficult to treat patients of this particular kind by rational methods, because they are in the main socially well-adapted individuals of considerable ability, to whom normalization means nothing. As for so-called normal people, I am even worse off in their regard, for I have no ready-made life-philosophy to hand out to them. In the majority of my cases, the resources of consciousness have been exhausted; the ordinary expression for this situation is: \u201cI am stuck.","But it is quite understandable that even the best of people are accessible to the idea of a state because, as I said, a state functions as something very real.

It is no mere chance that in olden times priestesses (like the Greek Sibyl) were used to fathom the divine will and to make connection with the gods. A particularly good example of how the anima is experienced as an inner figure in a man\u2019s psyche is found in the medicine men and prophets (shamans) among the Eskimo and other arctic tribes. Some of these even wear women\u2019s clothes or have breasts depicted on their garments, in order to manifest their inner feminine side\u2014the side that enables them to connect with the \u201cghost land (i.e., what we call the unconscious).\u201d","People will do anything, no matter how absurd, in order to avoid facing their own souls.

But have any human beings the right to totalitarian claims? This claim, certainly, is so morally dangerous that we would do better to leave its fulfilment to Almighty God rather than presume to be little gods ourselves at the expense of our fellow-men.","I am speaking here of things we have consciously seen or heard, and subsequently forgotten. But we all see, hear, smell, and taste many things without noticing them at the time, either because our attention is deflected or because the stimulus to our senses is too slight to leave a conscious impression. The unconscious, however, has taken note of them, and such subliminal sense perceptions play a significant part in our everyday lives. Without our realizing it, they influence the way in which we react to both events and people.","But I have said enough about the negative side of the anima. There are just as many important positive aspects. The anima is, for instance, responsible for the fact that a man is able to find the right marriage partner. Another function is at least equally important: Whenever a man\u2019s logical mind is incapable of discerning facts that are hidden in his unconscious, the anima helps him to dig them out. Even more vital is the role that the anima plays in putting a man\u2019s mind in tune with the right inner values and thereby opening the way into more profound inner depths. It is as if an inner \u201cradio becomes tuned to a certain wave length that excludes irrelevancies but allows the voice of the Great Man to be heard. In establishing this inner \u201cradio\u201d reception, the anima takes on the role of guide, or mediator, to the world within and to the Self. That is how she appears in the example of the initiations of shamans that I described earlier; this is the role of Beatrice in Dante\u2019s Paradiso, and also of the goddess Isis when she appeared in a dream to Apuleius, the famous author of The Golden Ass, in order to initiate him into a higher, more spiritual form of life.\u201d","Quem olha do lado de fora sonha; quem olha do lado de dentro desperta","Niekada sav\u0119s nelaukiau tuo, kuris privalo r\u016bpintis, kad vy\u0161nios tur\u0117t\u0173 kotelius.

The divine child approached me out of the terrible ambiguity, the hateful-beautiful, the evil-good, the laughable-serious, thesick-healthy, the inhuman-human and the ungodly-godly.129I understood that the Godl3o whom we seek in the absolute was not to be found in absolute beauty, goodness, seriousness,elevation, humanity or even in godliness. Once the God was there. I understood that the new God would be in the relative. If the God is absolute beauty and goodness, how should he encompass the of life, which is beautiful and hateful, good and evil, laughable and serious, human and inhuman? How can man live in the womb of the God if the Godheadhimself attends only to one-half of him?131If we have risen near the heights of good and evil, then ourbadness and hatefulness lie in the most extreme torment. Man\'s torment is so great and the air of the heights so wealc that he can hardly live anymore. The good and the beautiful freeze to the ice of the absolute idea/32 and the bad and hateful become mud puddles full of crazy life.Therefore after his death Christ had to journey to Hell, otherwise the ascent to Heaven would have become impos- sible for him. Christ first had to become his Antichrist, his underworldly brother.No one knows what happened during the three days Christ was in Hell. I have experienced it.133 The men ofyore said that he had preached there to the deceased.134 What they say is true, but do you know how this happened?It was folly and monkey business, an atrocious Hell\'s masquerade of the holiest mysteries. How else could Christ have saved his Antichrist? Read the unknown books of the ancients, and you will learn much from them. Notice that Christ did not remain in Hell, but rose to the heights in the beyond.135Our conviction of the value of the good and beautiful has become strong and unshakable, that is why life can extend beyond this and still fulfil everything that lay bound and yearning. But the bound and yearning is also the,hateful and bad. Are you again indignant about the hateful and the bad?Through this you can recognize h()w great are their force and value for life. Do you think that it is dead in you? But this dead can also change into serpents.136These serpents will extinguish the prince ofyour days.","In an earlier paragraph we traced the checking of the instincts back to fear of the very real dangers of existence in this world. But external reality is not the only source of thisinstinct-inhibiting fear, for primitive man is often very much more afraid of an \u201cinner reality\u2014the world of dreams,ancestral spirits, demons, gods, magicians, and witches. Although we, with our rationalism, think we can block this source of fear by pointing to its unreality, it nevertheless remains one of those psychic realities whose irrational naturecannot be exorcized by rational argument. You can free the primitive of certain superstitions, but you cannot talk him out of his alcoholism, his moral depravity, and general hopelessness. There is a psychic reality which is just aspitiless and just as inexorable as the outer world, and just as useful and helpful, provided one knows how to circumvent itsdangers and discover its hidden treasures.\u201d","Only gradually did I discover what the mandala really is: \u201cFormation, Transformation, Eternal Mind\u2019s eternal recreation.","As a matter of fact, primitive man is no more logical or illogical than we are. His presuppositions are not the same as ours, that is what distinguishes him from us.","In cases of extreme mass hysteria (which was in the past called \u201cpossession), the conscious mind and ordinary sense perception seem eclipsed. The frenzy of a Balinese sword dance causes the dancers to fall into trances and, sometimes, to turn their weapons against themselves.\u201d","In the act of sacrifice the consciousness gives up its power and possessions in the interests of the unconscious.",". . .in order to undergo a far-reaching psychological development, neither outstanding intelligence nor any other talent is necessary. . .","But what does the role of the anima as guide to the inner world mean in practical terms? This positive function occurs when a man takes seriously the feelings, moods, expectations, and fantasies sent by his anima and when he fixes them in some form\u2014for example, in writing, painting, sculpture, musical composition, or dancing. When he works at this patiently and slowly, other more deeply unconscious material wells up from the depths and connects with the earlier material. After a fantasy has been fixed in some specific form, it must be examined both intellectually and ethically, with an evaluating feeling reaction. And it is essential to regard it as being absolutely real; there must be no lurking doubt that this is \u201conly a fantasy. If this is practiced with devotion over a long period, the process of individuation gradually becomes the single reality and can unfold in its true form.\u201d","Mircea Eliade stated that for yoga and S\u0101khya philosophy to which it is related, in contrast to other Indian schools of thought, \u201cthe world is real (not illusory\u2014as it is, for example, for Ved\u0101nta). Nevertheless, if the world exists and endures, it is because of the \u2018ignorance\u2019 of spirit.16 What distinguishes yoga is its essentially practical cast.\u201d","One cannot individuate as long as one is playing a role to oneself; the convictions one has about oneself are the most subtle form of persona and the most subtle obstacle against any true individuation. One can admit practically anything, yet somewhere one retains the idea that one is nevertheless so-and-so, and this is always a sort of final argument which counts apparently as a plus; yet it functions as an influence against true individuation.It is a most painful procedure to tear off those veils, but each step forward in psychological development means just that, the tearing off of a new veil. We are like onions with many skins, and we have to peel ourselves again and again in order to get at the real core.","Meaning makes a great many things endurable \u2013 perhaps everything.","\u2026the lack of meaning in life is a soul-sickness whose full extent and import our age has not yet begun to comprehend.","La verdad suprema es una y la misma con lo contrario al sentido.","I remember the case of a man who was inextricably involved in a number of shady affairs. He developed an almost morbid passion for dangerous mountain climbing, as a sort of compensation. he was seeking \\"to get above himself.\\" In a dream one night, he saw himself stepping off the summit of a high mountain into empty space. When he told me his dream, I instantly saw his danger and tried to emphasize the warning and persuade him to restrain himself. I even told him that the dream foreshadowed his death in a mountain accident. It was in vain. Six months later he \\"stepped off into space.\\" A mountain guide watched him and a friend letting themselves down a rope in a difficult place. The friend had found a temporary foothold on a ledge, and the dreamer was following him down. Suddenly he let go of the rope, according to the guide, \\"as if he were jumping into the air.\\" He fell upon his friend, and both went down and were killed.Another typical case was that of a lady who was living above herself. She was high and mighty in her daily life, but she had shocking dreams, reminding her of all sorts of unsavory things. When I uncovered them, she indignantly refused to acknowledge them. The dreams then became menacing, and full of references to the walks she used to take by herself in the woods, where she indulged in soulful fantasies. I saw her danger, but she would not listen to my many warnings. Soon afterwards, she was savagely attacked in the woods by a sexual pervert; but for the intervention of some people who heard her screams, she would have been killed.There was no magic in this. What her dreams had told me was that this woman had a secret longing for such an adventure-just as the mountain climber unconsciously sought the satisfaction of finding a definite way out of this difficulties. Obviously, neither of them expected the stiff price involved: She had several bones broken, and he paid with his life.","It\'s erroneous to believe that religions differ in their innermost essence. Strictly speaking, it\'s always one and the same religion.

In alchemy, this state of instinctual hell is represented as a snake with three heads, the so-called serpens mercurii. It leads the soul into the afterworld, and is identical with the Gnostic Nous.","What I have so far said about the unconscious is no more than a cursory sketch of the nature and functioning of this complex part of the human psyche. But it should have indicated the kind of subliminal material from which the symbols of our dreams may be spontaneously produced. This subliminal material can consist of all urges, impulses, and intentions; all perceptions and intuitions; all rational or irrational thoughts, conclusions, inductions, deductions, and premises; and all varieties of feeling. Any or all of these can take the form of partial, temporary, or constant unconsciousness.","As the water of ablution, the dew falls from heaven, purifies the body, and makes it ready to receive the soul;195 in other words, it brings about the albedo, the white state of innocence,","In the morning it rises from the nocturnal sea of unconsciousness and looks upon the wide, bright world which lies before it in an expanse that steadily widens as it climbs higher in the firmament. In this extension of its field of action caused by its own rising, the sun will discover its own significance; it will see the attainment of the greatest possible height, and the widest possible dissemination of its blessings, as its goal.","But just as conscious contents can vanish into the unconscious, new contents, which have never yet been conscious, can arise from it.","the meaning of life is not exhaustively explained by one\u2019s business life, nor is the deep desire of the human heart answered by a bank account.","Here is the dwelling of night; whereas the lobby stood for the daylight world and its superficiality.","We find this in everyday life, where dilemmas are sometimes solved by the most surprising new propositions; many artists, philosophers, and even scientists owe some of their best ideas to inspirations that appear suddenly from the unconscious. The ability to reach a rich vein of such material and to translate it effectively into philosophy, literature, music, or scientific discovery is one of the hallmarks of what is commonly called genius.","They sometimes behave like the Delphic oracle that told King Croesus that if he crossed the Halys River he would destroy a large kingdom. It was only after he had been completely defeated in battle after the crossing that he discovered that the kingdom meant by the oracle was his own.","Bohr\u2019s idea of complementarity is especially interesting to Jungian psychologists, for Jung saw that the relationship between the conscious and unconscious mind also forms a complementary pair of opposites. Each new content that comes up from the unconscious is altered in its basic nature by being partly integrated into the conscious mind of the observer. Even dream contents (if noticed at all) are in that way semi-conscious. And each enlargement of the observer\u2019s consciousness caused by dream interpretation has again an immeasurable repercussion and influence on the unconscious. Thus the unconscious can only be approximately described (like the particles of microphysics) by paradoxical concepts. What it really is \u201cin itself we shall never know, just as we shall never know this about matter.\u201d","Nobody can become king except the one who is supposed to be king, the one who contains the idea of the Self.That is Christ according to the still generally prevailing Christian idea, and from such a standpoint any attempt at getting at individuation would be heretic, as it has always been; it has always been the party of the left hand and a crime.Christ himself was accused of heresy, and quite justifiably. John the Baptist and his school called Jeshu ben Miriam-the son of Miriam the deceiver, the traitor, because he had betrayed the mysteries; he became an individual, the son of God, and received immediate revelation, and that was an awful sin and the real cause of his death.It is an old Jewish tradition also that he betrayed the mysteries and so had to suffer the death of a traitor.In the literature of the Manichaeans, the disciples of John, there is a text containing a discussion between Christ and John the Baptist upon that question.They both presented very good arguments.Christ\'s very practical argument was: \'Do I not make the lame walk?Do I not restore sight to the blind?\'But John would not hear of that, he said that Christ betrayed the mysteries, he gave them out to the world, and that they would be destroyed by the world.And the world did destroy them.The projection of the Self belonged to the psychology of ancient times, when the chief or the king represented the whole people and had to suffer and to die for the people.Then another old rite played a certain role in the history of Christ; it is to a great extent legend, but legends are so true that they repeat themselves literally in reality, real events are like legends.","[11] \u201cThere are many Europeans who began by surrendering completely to the influence of the Christian symbol until they landed themselves in a Kierkegaardian neurosis, or whose relation to God, owing to the progressive impoverishment of symbolism, developed into an unbearably sophisticated I-You relationship\u2014only to fall victims in their turn to the magic and novelty of Eastern symbols. This surrender is not necessarily a defeat; rather it proves the receptiveness and vitality of the religious sense. We can observe much the same thing in the educated Oriental, who not infrequently feels drawn to the Christian symbol or to the science that is so unsuited to the Oriental mind, and even develops an enviable understanding of them. That people should succumb to these eternal images is entirely normal, in fact it is what these images are for. They are meant to attract, to convince, to fascinate, and to overpower. They are created out of the primal stuff of revelation and reflect the ever-unique experience of divinity","We can find clear proof of this fact in the history of science itself. For example, the French mathematician Poincar\xe9 and the chemist Kekul\xe9 owed important scientific discoveries (as they themselves admit) to sudden pictorial \u201crevelations from the unconscious. The so-called \u201cmystical\u201d experience of the French philosopher Descartes involved a similar sudden revelation in which he saw in a flash the \u201corder of all sciences.\u201d The British author Robert Louis Stevenson had spent years looking for a story that would fit his \u201cstrong sense of man\u2019s double being,\u201d when the plot of Dr. Jekyll and Mr. Hyde was suddenly revealed to him in a dream.\u201d","Exactly. Magic happens to be everything which eludes comprehension.","All the [energy] that was tied up in family bonds must be withdrawn from the narrower circle into the larger one, because the psychic health of the adult individual, who in childhood was a mere particle revolving in a rotary system, demands that he should himself become the centre of a new system.","A neurosis\u2026is not a disgrace\u2026It is not a fatal disease, but it does grow worse to the degree that one is determined to ignore it.","As a final example of parallel developments in micro-physics and psychology, we can consider Jung\u2019s concept of meaning. Where before men looked for causal (i.e., rational) explanations of phenomena, Jung introduced the idea of looking for the meaning (or, perhaps we could say, the \u201cpurpose). That is, rather than ask why something happened (i.e., what caused it), Jung asked: What did it happen for? This same tendency appears in physics: Many modern physicists are now looking more for \u201cconnections\u201d in nature than for causal laws (determinism).\u201d","Even the most absurd things are nothing other than symbols for thoughts which are not only understandable in human terms but dwell in every human breast. In intensity we do not discover anything new and unknown; we are looking at the foundations of our own being, the matrix of those vital problems on which we are all engaged.","In many cases in psychiatry, the patient who comes to us has a story that is not told, and which as a rule no one knows of. To my mind, therapy only really begins after the investigation of that wholly personal story. It is the patient\u2019s secret, the rock against which he is shattered. If I know his secret story, I have a key to the treatment. The doctor\u2019s task is to find out how to gain that knowledge. In most cases exploration of the conscious material is insufficient. Sometimes an association test can open the way; so can the interpretation of dreams, or long and patient human contact with the individual. In therapy the problem is always the whole person, never the symptom alone. We must ask questions which challenge the whole personality.","Dac\u0103 psihicul omului este ceva, atunci el este imprevizibil de complicat \u0219i de o varietate nelimitat\u0103, c\u0103reia nu-i cu putin\u021b\u0103 s\u0103-i faci fa\u021b\u0103 cu o simpl\u0103 psihologie a pulsiunilor.

But when an exact definition or a careful explanation is needed, one can occasionally discover the most amazing variations, not only in the purely intellectual understanding of the term, but particularly in its emotional tone and its application. As a rule, these variations are subliminal and therefore never realized.","Man today is painfully aware of the fact that neither his great religions nor his various philosophies seem to provide him with those powerful animating ideas that would give him the security he needs in face of the present condition of the world.","When we think of the unending growth and decay of life and civilizations, we cannot escape the impression of absolute nullity. Yet I have never lost a sense of something that lives and endures underneath the eternal flux. What we see is the blossom, which passes. The rhizome remains.","I was unable to understand how a perfectly rational argument could meet with such emotional resistance.","Flight from life does not exempt us from the law of age and death. The neurotic who tries to wriggle out of the necessity of living wins nothing and only burdens himself with a constant foretaste of aging and dying, which must appear especially cruel on account of the total emptiness and meaninglessness of his life.","In each of us there is another whom we do not know. He speaks to us in dreams and tells us how differently he sees us from the way we see ourselves.","Every concept in our conscious mind, in short, has its own psychic associations. While such associations may vary in intensity (according to the relative importance of the concept to our whole personality, or according to the other ideas and even complexes to which it is associated in our unconscious), they are capable of changing the \u201cnormal character of that concept. It may even become something quite different as it drifts below the level of consciousness.\u201d","Jung\'s search for the soul, then, stands at one with the search for appropriately dialogical and differentiated language.","It is necessary to have metaphysical ideas-we cannot do without them-but it is also necessary to submit them very seriously to the test whether they agree with the human being: a good metaphysical idea does not spoil one\'s stomach. For instance, if I hold a metaphysical conviction that we live on after death for fifty thousand years instead of fifty million-if that is a solution-! try what it means if I believe in fifty thousand years only; perhaps that is good for my digestion-or bad. You see, I have no other criterion. Of course, it sounds funny, but I start from the conviction that man has also a living body and if something is true for one side, it must be true for the other. For what is the body? The body is merely the visibility of the soul, the psyche; and the soul is the psychological experience of the body. So it is really one and the same thing. Therefore, a good truth must be true for the whole system, not only for half of it. According to my imagination, something seems to be good-it f-its in with my imagination-but it proves to be entirely wrong for my body. And something might apparently be quite nice for the body, but it is very bad for the experience of the soul, and in that case I have a metaphysical enteritis. So I must be careful to bring the two systems together; the only criterion is that both are balanced. When life flows, then I can say it is probably all right, but if I get upset I know something must be wrong, out of order at least.Jung, C. G.. Nietzsche\'s Zarathustra: Notes of the Seminar given in 1934-1939. Two Volumes: 1-2, unabridged (Jung Seminars) (p. 355).","In order to make the language of dreams understood, we use many parallels from the psychology of primitive races as well as from historical symbolism. This is because dreams originate in the unconscious, which contains the residual potentialities of function of all preceding epochs of evolution.","At\xe2t sufletul, c\xe2t \u0219i trupul nostru sunt compuse din elemente care, toate, au fost prezente deja \xeen \u0219irul str\u0103mo\u0219ilor no\u0219tri. \\"Noul din sufletul individual este o recombinare variat\u0103 la infinit a unor p\u0103r\u021bi componente extrem de vechi, de aceea trupul \u0219i sufletul au un caracter eminamente istoric \u0219i nu-\u0219i g\u0103sesc un loc adecvat \xeen ceea ce este nou \u0219i abia atunci alc\u0103tuit; cu alte cuvinte, tr\u0103s\u0103turile ancestrale se reg\u0103sesc acolo doar par\u021bial.

Harm can result only if one side or the other remains unconscious of the limitations of its claim to validity.","whatever form it takes, the function of the shadow is to represent the opposite side of the ego and to embody just those qualities that one dislikes most in other people.","Thus a word or an image is symbolic when it implies something more than its obvious and immediate meaning.","(I) \\"My soul spoke to me in a whisper, urgently and alarmingly: \'Words, words, do not make too many words. Be silent and listen: have you recognized your madness, and do you admit it? Have you noticed that all your foundations are all completely mired in madness?\'\\" (2) Jung\'s soul: \\"There are hellish webs of words, only words...Be tentative with words, value them...for you are the first who gets snared in them. For words have meanings. With words you pull up the underworld. Word, the paltriest and mightiest. In words the emptiness and the fullness flow together. Hence the word is an image of the God.\\" (3) \\"But if the word is a symbol, it means everything. When the way enters death and we are surrounded by rot and horror, the way rises in the darkness and leaves the mouth as the saving symbol, the word.","Attempt to influence public opinion by means of newspapers, radio, television, and advertising are based on two factors. On the one hand, they rely on sampling techniques that reveal the trend of \\"opinion\\" or \\"wants\\"-that is, of collective attitudes. On the other, they express the prejudices, projections, and unconscious complexes (mainly the power complex) of those who manipulate public opinion. But statistics do no justice to the individual. Although the average size of stones in a heap may be five centimeters, one will find very few stones of exactly this size in the heap.","When thinking leads to the unthinkable, it is time to return to simple life. What thinking cannot solve, life solves, and what action never decides is reserved for thinking. If I ascend to the highest and most difficult on the one hand, and seek to eke out redemption that reaches even higher, then the true way does not lead upward, but toward the depths, since only my other leads me beyond myself. But acceptance of the other means a descent into the opposite, from seriousnesss into the laughable, from suffering into the cheerful, from the beautiful into the ugly, from the pure into the impure.","Yet the emotions that effect us are just the same. In fact, the terrors that stem from our elaborate civilization may be far more threatening than those that primitive people attribute to demons. The attitude of modern civilized man sometimes reminds me of a psychotic patient in my clinic who was himself a doctor. One morning I asked him how he was. He replied that he had had a wonderful night disinfecting the whole of heaven with mercuric chloride, but that in the course of this thorough-going sanitary process he had found no trace of God. Here we see a neurosis or something worse. Instead of God or the \u201cfear of God, there is an anxiety neurosis or some kind of phobia. The emotion has remained the same, but its object has changed both its name and nature for the worse.\u201d","What direction the patient\u2019s life should take in the future is not ours to judge. We must not imagine that we know better than his own nature, or we would prove ourselves educators of the worst kind\u2026It is better to renounce any attempt to give direction, and simply to try to throw into relief everything that the analysis brings to light, so that the patient can see it clearly and be able to draw suitable conclusions. Anything he has not acquired himself he will not believe in the long run, and what he takes over from authority merely keeps him infantile. He should rather be put in the position to take his own life in hand.","As the mind explores the symbol, it is led to ideas that lie beyond the grasp of reason.","man does not stand forever, his nullification.they all seek their own existence and to assure their existence against that complete atomization into nothingness or into meaninglessness.

Not only is it desirable, it is absolutely indispensable because, through his contamination with others, he falls into situations and commits actions which bring him into disharmony with himself . . .[and] acts in a way contrary to [his] own nature. Accordingly a man can neither be at one with himself nor accept responsibility for himself. He feels himself to be in a degrading, unfree, unethical condition. But the disharmony with himself is precisely the neurotic and intolerable condition from which he seeks to be delivered, and deliverance from this condition will come only when he can be and act as he feels is conformable with his true self.","The golden apples drop from the same tree, whether they be gathered by an imbecile locksmith\'s apprentice or by a Schopenhauer.","Where Voegelin seeks to show the Gnostic nature of modernity, Jonas seeks to show the modern nature of Gnosticism.

In the physical structure of the body we find traces of earlier stages of evolution, and we may expect the human psyche also to conform in its make-up to the law of phylogeny.","In our Western civilization the Cosmic Man has been identified to a great extent with Christ, and in the East with Krishna or with Buddha. In the Old Testament this same symbolic figure turns up as the \u201cSon of Man and in later Jewish mysticism is called Adam Kadmon. Certain religious movements of late antiquity simply called him Anthropos (the Greek word for man). Like all symbols this image points to an unknowable secret\u2014to the ultimate unknown meaning of human existence.\u201d","A man cannot get rid of himself in favour of an artificial personality without punishment, wrote Jung. \u201cEven the attempt to do so brings on, in all ordinary cases, unconscious reactions in the form of bad moods, affects, phobias, obsessive ideas, backslidings, vices, etc. The social \u201cstrongman\u201d is in his private life often a mere child where his own states of feeling are concerned; his discipline in public (which he demands quite particularly of others) goes miserably to pieces in private.\u201d","Whereas in its developments up to the present psychology has dealt chiefly with psychic processes in the light of physical causation, the future task of psychology will be the investigation of their spiritual determinants. But the natural history of the mind is no further advanced today than was natural science in the thirteenth century. We have only begun to take scientific note of our spiritual experiences.","Projection is one of the commonest psychic phenomena\u2026Everything that is unconscious in ourselves we discover in our neighbour, and we treat him accordingly.","It had been proved to me that I had to abandon the idea of the superordinate position of the ego.","Most connections in the world are not relationships, they are participation mystique. One is then apparently connected, but of course it is never a real connection, it is never a relationship; but it gives the feeling of being one sheep in a \ufb02ock at least, which is something. While if you disqualify yourself as a sheep you are necessarily out of the \ufb02ock and will su\ufb00er from a certain loneliness, despite the fact that you then have a chance to reestablish a relationship, and this time a conscious relationship, which is far more satisfactory. Participation mystique gives one a peculiar unconsciousness, which is in a way a function of the mother; one is carried in unconsciousness. Sometimes it is nice and sometimes it is not nice at all, but as a rule people prefer it because the average man gets awfully frightened when he has to do something which he cannot share with his world; he is afraid to be alone, to think something which other people don\u2019t think, or to feel something which other people don\u2019t feel. One is up against man\u2019s gregarious instinct as soon as one tries to transcend the ordinary consciousness.","For the sake of mental stability and even physiological health, the unconscious and the conscious must be integrally connected and thus move on parallel lines. If they are split apart or \u201cdissociated, psychological disturbance follows. In this respect, dream symbols are the essential message carriers from the instinctive to the rational parts of the human mind, and their interpretation enriches the poverty of consciousness so that it learns to understand again the forgotten language of the instincts.\u201d","Can we make any sort of objective judgment about the final result? Only if we make a comparison between our conclusions and the standards that are generally valid in the social milieu to which the individuals belong. Even then, we must take into account the mental equilibrium (or \u201csanity) of the individual concerned. For the result cannot be a completely collective leveling out of the individual to adjust him to the \u201cnorms\u201d of his society. This would amount to a most unnatural condition. A sane and normal society is one in which people habitually disagree, because general agreement is relatively rare outside the sphere of instinctive human qualities.\u201d","I am an orphan, alone; nevertheless I am found everywhere. I am one, but opposed to myself. I am youth and old man at one and the same time. I have known neither father nor mother, because I have had to be fetched out of the deep like a fish, or fell like a white stone from heaven. In woods and mountains I roam, but I am hidden in the innermost soul of man. I am mortal for everyone, yet I am not touched by the cycle of aeons.","It is a fact that in eclipses of consciousness\u2014in dreams, narcotic states and cases of insanity\u2014there come to the surface psychic products or contents that show all the traits of primitive levels of psychic development.","Man has developed consciousness slowly and laboriously, in a process that took untold ages to reach the civilized state (which is arbitrarily dated from the invention of script in about 4000 B.C.). And this evolution is far from complete, for large areas of the human mind are still shrouded in darkness. What we call the \u201cpsyche is by no means identical with our consciousness and its contents.\u201d","Time is a child\u2014playing like a child\u2014playing a board game\u2014the kingdom of the child. This is Telesphoros, who roams through the dark regions of this cosmos and glows like a star out of the depths. He points the way to the gates of the sun and to the land of dreams.2","Everything that is beyond the ordinary is paid for.

If you think it is not, you simply don\'t know; somebody has paid.","But somewhere and at some time there must have been people who sought the truth as I was doing,","When one tries desperately to be good and wonderful and perfect, then all the more the shadow develops a definite will to be black and evil and destructive. People cannot see that; they are always striving to be marvellous, and then they discover that terrible destructive things happen which they cannot understand, and they either deny that such facts have anything to do with them, or if they admit them, they take them for natural afflictions, or they try to minimize them and to shift the responsibility elsewhere. The fact is that if one tries beyond one\u2019s capacity to be perfect, the shadow descends into hell and becomes the devil.","[...] un fapt psihologic oarecare nu poate fi niciodat\u0103 explicat total prin cauzalitatea lui; el este un fenomen viu, legat indestructibil de continuitatea procesului vital, \xeen a\u0219a fel \xeenc\xe2t este, pe de-o parte, \xeentotdeauna un ce care a devenit, pe de alta, un ce \xeen curs de devenire, un ce creator.","Tenham tamb\xe9m um \'confessor\', homem ou mulher.

They argue na\xefvely that such an assumption implies the existence of two \u201csubjects, or (to put it in a common phrase) two personalities within the same individual. But this is exactly what it does imply\u2014quite correctly. And it is one of the curses of modern man that many people suffer from this divided personality. It is by no means a pathological symptom; it is a normal fact that can be observed at any time and everywhere. It is not merely the neurotic whose right hand does not know what the left hand is doing. This predicament is a symptom of a general unconsciousness that is the undeniable common inheritance of all mankind.\u201d","The unconscious has still another side to it: it includes not only repressed contents, but all psychic material that lies below the threshold of consciousness.","Here I ought to add a word of warning against unintelligent or incompetent dream analysis. There are some people whose mental condition is so unbalanced that the interpretation of their dreams can be extremely risky; in such a case, a very one-sided consciousness is cut off from a correspondingly irrational or \u201ccrazy unconscious, and the two should not be brought together without taking special precautions.\u201d","Everyone has in him something of the criminal, the genius, and the saint.","Whoever denies the existence of the unconscious is in fact assuming that our present knowledge of the psyche is total. And this belief is clearly just as false as the assumption that we know all there is to be known about the natural universe. Our psyche is part of nature, and its enigma is as limitless. Thus we cannot define either the psyche or nature. We can merely state what we believe them to be and describe, as best we can, how they function. Quite apart, therefore, from the evidence that medical research has accumulated, there are strong grounds of logic for rejecting statements like \u201cThere is no unconscious. Those who say such things merely express an age-old \u201cmisoneism\u201d\u2014a fear of the new and the unknown.\u201d","Not that these others are wholly without blame, for even the worst projection is at least hung on a hook, perhaps a very small one, but still a hook offered by the other person.","[A] sense of moral inferiority writes Jung \u201calways indicates that the missing element is something which, to judge by this feeling about it, really ought not to be missing, or which could be made conscious if only one took sufficient trouble. . .Whenever a sense of moral inferiority appears, it indicates not only a need to assimilate an unconscious component, but also the possibility of such assimilation.\u201d","\xa1D\xf3nde hay una voluntad se encuentra un camino!","Hell is when the depths come to you with all that you no longer are or are not yet capable of Hell is when you can no longer attain what you could attain. Hell is when you must think and feel and do everything that you know you do not want. Hell is when you know that your having to is also a wanting to, and that you yourself are responsible for it. Hell is when you know that everything serious that you have planned with yourself is also laughable, that everything fineis also brutal, that everything good is also bad, that everything high is also low, and that everything pleasant is also shameful. But the deepest Hell is when you realize that Hell is also no Hell, but a cheerful Heaven, not a Heaven in itself, but in this respect a Heaven, and in that respect a Hell.","The patient married during the course of her treatment with me, but not without a violent resistance to this step. The cause of her neurotic resistance came to light only after many months, and there is not a hint of it anywhere in these dreams. They are without exception anticipations of the difficulties she is to have with the analysts to whom she has come for treatment.","Our mandala is indeed an \'eye,\' the structure of which symbolizes the centre of order in the unconscious. The eye is a hollow sphere, black inside, and filled with a semi-liquid substance, the vitreous humour. Looking at it from outside, one sees a round, coloured surface, the iris, with a dark centre, from which a golden light shines. Bohme calls it a \'fiery eye,\' in accordance with the old idea that seeing emanates from the eye. The eye may well stand for consciousness (which is in fact an organ of perception), looking into its own background. It sees its own light there, and when this is clear and pure the whole body is filled with light. Under certain conditions consciousness has a purifying effect. This is probably what is meant by Matthew 6 : 22ff., an idea expressed even more clearly in Luke 11 : 33. The eye is also a well-known symbol for God.Hence Bohme calls his \'Philosophique Globe\' the \'Eye of Eternity,\' the \'Essence of all Essences,\' the \'Eye of God.\' By accepting the darkness, the patient has not, to be sure, changed it into light, but she has kindled a light that illuminates the darkness within. By day no light is needed, and if you don\'t know it is night you won\'t light one, nor will any light be lit for you unless you have suffered the horror of darkness. This is not an edifying text but a mere statement of the psychological facts.","The personal sphere is indeed disturbed, but such disturbances need not be primary; they may well be secondary, the consequence of an insupportable change in the social atmosphere. The cause of disturbance is, therefore, not to be sought in the personal surroundings, but rather in the collective situation.","I could cite many other dreams to the same effect, but these may suffice to show that dreams can be anticipatory and, in that case, must lose their particular meaning if they are treated in a purely causalistic way. These three dreams give clear information about the analytical situation, and it is extremely important for the purposes of therapy that this be rightly understood.","There are historical reasons for this resistance to the idea of an unknown part of the human psyche. Consciousness is a very recent acquisition of nature, and it is still in an \u201cexperimental state. It is frail, menaced by specific dangers, and easily injured. As anthropologists have noted, one of the most common mental derangements that occur among primitive people is what they call \u201cthe loss of a soul\u201d\u2014which means, as the name indicates, a noticeable disruption (or, more technically, a dissociation) of consciousness.\u201d","Proto st\xe1le odhadujeme n\u011bco nov\xe9ho o sob\u011b sam\xfdch.

This mood makes itself felt everywhere, politically, socially, and philosophically. We are living in what the Greeks called the \\"Kairos\\"-the right moment- for a \u201cmetamorphosis of the gods, of the fundamental principle and symbols. This peculiarity of our time, which is certainly not of our conscious choosing, is the expression of the unconscious man within who is changing.

Great poetry draws its strength from the life of mankind, and we completely miss its meaning if we try to derive it from personal factors. Whenever the collective unconscious becomes a living experience and is brought to bear upon the conscious outlook of an age, this event is a creative act which is of importance to everyone living in that age.","Jung found that evidence in two sources: alchemy and Gnosticism. Interpreted psychologically, both served as hoary counterparts to his brand of psychology and therefore as evidence of its objectivity: The experiences of the alchemists were, in a sense, my experiences, and their world was my world. This was, of course, a momentous discovery: I had stumbled upon the historical counterpart of my psychology of the unconscious. The possibility of a comparison with alchemy, and the uninterrupted intellectual chain back to Gnosticism, gave substance to my psychology.24","It is under all circumstances an advantage to be in full possession of one\u2019s personality, otherwise the repressed portions of the personality will only crop up as a hindrance elsewhere, not just at some unimportant point, but at the very spot where we are most sensitive: this worm always rots the core. Instead of waging war on himself it is surely better for a man to learn to tolerate himself, and to convert his inner difficulties into real experiences instead of expending them in useless fantasies.

So Faust touches something in the soul of every German. So also Dante\'s fame is immortal, while The Shepherd of Hermas just failed of inclusion in the New Testament canon. Every period has its bias, its particular prejudice and its psychic ailment.","could moreover have assured himself beyond all doubt on this point had he taken counsel with his own omniscience.","Understanding is clearly a subjective process. It may be very one-sided, in that the physician understands while the patient does not. In such a case the doctor sometimes feels it his duty to convince the patient, and if the latter will not allow himself to be convinced, the doctor accuses him of resistance. When the understanding is all on my side, I find it advisable to stress my lack of understanding. It is relatively unimportant whether the doctor understands or not, but everything hangs on the patient\'s doing so. What is really needed is a mutual agreement which is the fruit of joint reflection. It is one-sided, and therefore dangerous, understanding for the doctor to prejudge the dream from the standpoint of a certain doctrine and to make a pronouncement which may be theoretically sound, but does not win the patient\'s assent. In so far as the pronouncement fails in this respect, it is incorrect in the practical sense; and it may also be incorrect in the sense that it anticipates and thereby cripples the actual development of the patient. We appeal only to the patient\'s brain if we try to inculcate a truth; but if we help him to grow up to this truth in the course of his own development, we have reached his heart, and this appeal goes deeper and acts with greater force.","This emotional value must be kept in mind and allowed for throughout the whole intellectual process of dream interpretation. It is only too easy to lose this value, because thinking and feeling are so diametrically opposed that thinking almost automatically throws out feeling values and vice versa.","Church gradually became a place of torment to me. For there men dared to preach aloud\u2014I am tempted to say, shamelessly\u2014about God, about His intentions and actions. There people were exhorted to have those feelings and to believe that secret which I knew to be the deepest, innermost certainty, a certainty not to be betrayed by a single word. I could only conclude that apparently no one knew about this secret, not even the parson, for otherwise no one would have dared to expose the mystery of God in public and to profane those inexpressible feelings with stale sentimentalities.","Kdy\u017e n\xe1s n\u011bco rozzlob\xed a\u017e do nep\u0159\xed\u010detnosti, nep\u0159ipust\xedme si, \u017ee p\u0159\xed\u010dina na\u0161eho hn\u011bvu nemus\xed spo\u010d\xedvat jen mimo n\xe1s, ve v\u011bci nebo osob\u011b, kter\xe1 n\xe1s rozzlobila.

Man feels himself isolated in the cosmos, because he is no longer involved in nature and has lost his emotional \u201cunconscious identity with natural phenomena. These have slowly lost their symbolic implications. Thunder is no longer the voice of an angry god, nor is lightning his avenging missile. No river contains a spirit, no tree is the life principle of a man, no snake the embodiment of wisdom, no mountain cave the home of a great demon. No voices now speak to man from stones, plants, and animals, nor does he speak to them believing they can hear. His contact with nature has gone, and with it has gone the profound emotional energy that this symbolic connection supplied.\u201d","I cannot employ the language of science to trace this process of growth in myself, for I cannot experience myself as a scientific problem.","The \\"I\\" was not the self, but from there one could see the divine miracle. The small light resembled the great light. Henceforth, he stopped painting mandalas. The dream had expressed the unconscious developmental process, which was not linear, and he found it completely satisfying. He felt utterly alone at that time, preoccupied with something great that others didn\'t understand. In the dream, only he saw the tree. While they stood in the darkness, the tree appeared radiantly. Had he not had such a vision, his life would have lost meaning.","But the Gnostics were too remote for me to establish any link with them in regard to the questions that were confronting me. As far as I could see, the tradition that might have connected Gnosis with the present seemed to have been severed, and for a long time it proved impossible to find any bridge that led from Gnosticism\u2014or neo-Platonism\u2014to the contemporary world. But when I began to understand alchemy I realized that it represented the historical link with Gnosticism, and that a continuity therefore existed between past and present. Grounded in the natural philosophy of the Middle Ages, alchemy formed the bridge on the one hand into the past, to Gnosticism, and on the other into the future, to the modern psychology of the unconscious.27","Sacrifice always means the renunciation of a valuable part of oneself, and through it the sacrificer escapes being devoured.","Lo bueno y lo malo est\xe1n contenidos l\xf3gicamente en la naturaleza y en el fondo s\xf3lo son graduales diferencias a una misma cosa.","Primitiv si minim\xe1ln\u011b uv\u011bdomuje s\xe1m sebe a sou\u010dasn\u011b se maxim\xe1ln\u011b vztahuje k objektu, kter\xfd na n\u011bj dokonce m\u016f\u017ee vyv\xedjet p\u0159\xedm\xfd magick\xfd n\xe1tlak.

Out of that condition grows the thing which is really fought for. For Nietzsche, it would be the birth of the Superman. We would say it was the birth of the self. Only through extreme pain do you experience yourself; you believe then that you are a unit. Before that, you can imagine that you are anybody, the Pope or Mussolini-you are not necessarily yourself. Afterwards, when you have undergone this extraordinary experience of the self, there are no illusions any longer.Jung, C. G.. Nietzsche\'s Zarathustra: Notes of the Seminar given in 1934-1939. Two Volumes: 1-2, unabridged (Jung Seminars) (p. 449)","An epoch is like an individual; it has its own limitations of conscious outlook, and therefore requires a compensatory adjustment. This is effected by the collective unconscious in that a poet, a seer or a leader allows himself to be guided by the unexpressed desire of his times and shows the way, by word or deed, to the attainment of that which everyone blindly craves and expects\u2014whether this attainment results in good or evil, the healing of an epoch or its destruction.","Thinking is difficult, that\'s why most people judge!","When Freud speaks of the \\"dream-fa\xe7ade\\", he is really speaking, not of the dream itself, but of its obscurity, and in so doing is projecting upon the dream his own lack of understanding. We say that the dream has a false front only because we fail to see into it. We would do better to say that we are dealing with something like a text that is unintelligible, not because it has a facade, but simply because we cannot read it. We do not have to get behind such a text in the first place, but must learn to read it.","The most that can fairly be demanded is that the number of individual observations shall be as high as possible. If this number, statistically considered, falls within the limits of chance expectation, then it has been statistically proved that it was a question of chance; but no explanation has thereby been furnished. There has merely been an exception to the rule.","spite of the suppression of the Gnostic heresy, it [the heresy] continued to flourish throughout the Middle Ages under the guise of alchemy.30 For Jung, the alchemical process of extracting gold from base metals is a continuation of the Gnostic process of liberating fallen sparks from matter. Both processes are seemingly outward, physical or metaphysical ones which in fact are inner, psychological ones. Both represent a progression from sheer ego consciousness to the ego\u2019s rediscovery of the unconscious and reintegration with it to forge the self. In alchemy the progression is from base metals to the distillation of vapor out of them and the return of that vapor to the metals to form gold. In Gnosticism the progression is from the Gnostic\u2019s sheer bodily existence to the release of the immaterial spark within the Gnostic\u2019s body and the reunion of that spark with the godhead. In both cases the state truly sought lies within human beings\u2014between the ego and the unconscious\u2014rather than outside them\u2014between the vapor and the metals or between the spark and the godhead. The human state is simply projected onto the external world.31\u201d","He who is most guilty is most innocent; the most holy man is the one most conscious of his sin.","But God, who also does not hear our prayers, wants to become man, and for that purpose he has chosen, through the Holy Ghost, the creaturely man filled with darkness\u2014the natural man who is tainted with original sin and who learnt the divine arts and sciences from the fallen angels.","Nikdo rozumn\xfd nepop\u0159e, \u017ee organizace na\u0161\xed spole\u010dnosti, nazvan\xe1 st\xe1t, poci\u0165uje nejen \u017eivou pot\u0159ebu z\xedskat v\u011bt\u0161\xed autoritu, ale i okolnosti ji k tomu nut\xed.

My way of dealing with them, moreover, would be quite superfluous if all that we could expect of them were a collection of hints and insights helpful to the doctor. But since it is probable, as I have shown in a few examples, that dreams contain more than practical helps for the doctor, dream-analysis deserves very special consideration. Sometimes, indeed, it is a matter of life and death.","Only in the desert do we become aware of our terrible simple-mindedness, but we are afraid of admitting it.","What a terrifying thing it is to be yourself","Because I carried the war in me, I foresaw it.","A child, as I have said, possesses a sense of completeness, but only before the initial emergence of his ego-consciousness. In the case of an adult, a sense of completeness is achieved through a union of the consciousness with the unconscious contents of the mind. Out of this union arises what Jung called \u201cthe transcendent function of the psyche, by which a man can achieve his highest goal: the full realization of the potential of his individual Self.\u201d","Life has always seemed to me like a plant that lives on its rhizome. Its true life is invisible, hidden in the rhizome. The part that appears above ground lasts only a single summer. Then it withers away -an ephemeral apparition. When we think of the unending growth and decay of life and civilizations, we cannot escape the impression of absolute nullity. Yet I have never lost a sense of something that lives and endures underneath the eternal flux. What we see is the blossom, which passes. The rhizome remains.\\" -Memories, Dreams, Reflections -Carl Gustav Jung","No one should deny the danger of the descent, but it can be risked. No one need to risk it, but it is certain that someone will. And let those who go down the sunset way do so with open eyes, for it is a sacrifice which daunts even the gods. Yet every descent is followed by an ascent; the vanishing shapes are shaped anew, and a truth is valid in the end only if it suffers change and bears new witness in new images, in new tongues, like a new wine that is put into new bottles.","Who has vocation hears the voice of the inner man; he is called. And so it is the legendary belief that he possesses a private demon who counsels him and whose mandates he must execute.","\u042f \u0443\u0436\u0435 \u0432\u044b\u0441\u043a\u0430\u0437\u044b\u0432\u0430\u043b \u043f\u0440\u0435\u0434\u043f\u043e\u043b\u043e\u0436\u0435\u043d\u0438\u0435 \u043e \u0442\u043e\u043c, \u0447\u0442\u043e \u0441\u043d\u044b \u0432\u044b\u043f\u043e\u043b\u043d\u044f\u044e\u0442 \u0437\u0430\u0434\u0430\u0447\u0443 \u043a\u043e\u043c\u043f\u0435\u043d\u0441\u0430\u0446\u0438\u0438.\u0427\u0435\u043b\u043e\u0432\u0435\u043a\u0443 \u0436\u0435 \u043d\u044b\u043d\u0435\u0448\u043d\u0435\u0439 \u0446\u0438\u0432\u0438\u043b\u0438\u0437\u0430\u0446\u0438\u0438 \u0434\u043e\u043f\u0443\u0441\u0442\u0438\u0442\u044c, \u0447\u0442\u043e \u0435\u0433\u043e \u043f\u0440\u043e\u0431\u043b\u0435\u043c\u044b \u0432\u044b\u0437\u0432\u0430\u043d\u044b \u0432\u0441\u0435\u0433\u043e-\u043d\u0430\u0432\u0441\u0435\u0433\u043e \u0448\u0430\u043b\u043e\u0441\u0442\u044f\u043c\u0438 \u0432\u043e\u043e\u0431\u0440\u0430\u0436\u0435\u043d\u0438\u044f\u2014\u044d\u0442\u043e \u043d\u0430 \u0433\u0440\u0430\u043d\u0438 \u0438\u043d\u0444\u0430\u0440\u043a\u0442\u0430.","Thus, what we call \u201csymbols of transcendence are the symbols that represent man\u2019s striving to attain this goal. They provide the means by which the contents of the unconscious can enter the conscious mind, and they also are themselves an active expression of those contents.\u201d","We find . . . in everyday life, where dilemmas are sometimes solved by the most surprising new propositions; many artists, philosophers, and even scientists owe some of their best ideas to inspirations . . . from the unconscious.","A psicologia do indiv\xedduo corresponde \xe0 psicologia das na\xe7\xf5es.
