So, what are you doing today?","The welfare of the people in particular has always been the alibi of tyrants.","Life is meaningless, but worth living, provided you recognize it\'s meaningless.","My dear, In the midst of hate, I found there was, within me, an invincible love. In the midst of tears, I found there was, within me, an invincible smile. In the midst of chaos, I found there was, within me, an invincible calm. I realized, through it all, that\u2026 In the midst of winter, I found there was, within me, an invincible summer. And that makes me happy. For it says that no matter how hard the world pushes against me, within me, there\u2019s something stronger \u2013 something better, pushing right back. Truly yours, Albert Camus","Sometimes, carrying on, just carrying on, is the superhuman achievement.","Nobody realizes that some people expend tremendous energy merely to be normal.","Freedom is not constituted primarily of privileges but of responsibilities.","Nothing is more despicable than respect based on fear.","Whoever gives nothing, has nothing. The greatest misfortune is not to be unloved, but not to love.","Every time I hear a political speech or I read those of our leaders, I am horrified at having, for years, heard nothing which sounded human. It is always the same words telling the same lies. And the fact that men accept this, that the people\u2019s anger has not destroyed these hollow clowns, strikes me as proof that men attribute no importance to the way they are governed; that they gamble \u2013 yes, gamble \u2013 with a whole part of their life and their so called \'vital interests.","The Four Conditions of Happiness: Life in the open air, Love for another being,Freedom from ambition,Creation","I would rather live my life as if there is a God and die to find out there isn\'t, than live as if there isn\'t and to die to find out that there is.","Yes, everything is simple. It\'s people who complicate things.","The greatness of man lies in his decision to be stronger than his condition.","Do not be afraid of spending quality time by yourself. Find meaning or don\u2019t find meaning but \u201csteal\u201d some time and give it freely and exclusively to your own self. Opt for privacy and solitude. That doesn\u2019t make you antisocial or cause you to reject the rest of the world. But you need to breathe. And you need to be.","There is no sun without shadow, and it is essential to know the night.","The need to be right is the sign of a vulgar mind.","To grow old is to pass from passion to compassion.","I rebel; therefore I exist.","Integrity needs no rules.","The evil that is in the world always comes of ignorance, and good intentions may do as much harm as malevolence, if they lack understanding.","Those who lack the courage will always find a philosophy to justify it.","Fiction is the lie through which we tell the truth.","Democracy is not the law of the majority but the protection of the minority.","Always go too far, because that\'s where you\'ll find the truth","Blessed are the hearts that can bend; they shall never be broken.","Man is the only creature that refuses to be what he is.","There are causes worth dying for, but none worth killing for.","Where there is no hope, we must invent it.","The society based on production is only productive, not creative.","Should I kill myself, or have a cup of coffee?","When I was young I asked more of people than they could give: everlasting friendship, endless feeling. Now I know to ask less of them than they can give: a straightforward companionship. And their feelings, their friendship, their generous actions seem in my eyes to be wholly miraculous: a consequence of grace alone.","We must admit that today conformity is on the Left. To be sure, the Right is not brilliant. But the Left is in complete decadence, a prisoner of words, caught in its own vocabulary, capable merely of stereotyped replies, constantly at a loss when faced with truth, from which it nevertheless claimed to derive its laws. The Left is schizophrenic and needs doctoring through pitiless self-criticism, exercise of the heart, close reasoning, and a little modesty.","What is a rebel? A man who says no.","Liberty is the right not to lie.","You will never live if you are looking for the meaning of life.","The realization that life is absurd cannot be an end, but only a beginning.","You cannot create experience. You must undergo it.","Some people talk in their sleep. Lecturers talk while other people sleep.","It is the job of thinking people not to be on the side of the executioners.","After all perhaps the greatness of art lies in the perpetual tension between beauty and pain, the love of men and the madness of creation, unbearable solitude and the exhausting crowd, rejection and consent.","I know of only one duty, and that is to love.","Truth and freedom, having few lovers, are demanding mistresses.","Get scared. It will do you good. Smoke a bit, stare blankly at some ceilings, beat your head against some walls, refuse to see some people, paint and write. Get scared some more. Allow your little mind to do nothing but function. Stay inside, go out - I don\'t care what you\'ll do; but stay scared as hell. You will never be able to experience everything. So, please, do poetical justice to your soul and simply experience yourself.","The most important thing you do everyday you live is deciding not to kill yourself.","In the midst of winter, I found there was, within me, an invincible summer. And that makes me happy. For it says that no matter how hard the world pushes against me, within me, there\u2019s something stronger \u2013 something better, pushing right back.","It is necessary to fall in love... if only to provide an alibi for all the random despair you are going to feel anyway.","Humans are creatures, who spent their lifes trying to convince themselves, that their existence is not absurd","Life is the sum of your choices.","Basically, at the very bottom of life, which seduces us all, there is only absurdity, and more absurdity. And maybe that\'s what gives us our joy for living, because the only thing that can defeat absurdity is lucidity.","Charm is a way of getting the answer \'Yes\' without asking a clear question.","You will never be able to experience everything. So, please, do poetical justice to your soul and simply experience yourself.","If we understood the enigmas of life there would be no need for art.","But what is happiness except the simple harmony between a man and the life he leads?","A man without ethics is a wild beast loosed upon this world.","When I look at my life and its secret colors, I feel like bursting into tears.","Poor and free rather than rich and enslaved. Of course, men want to be both rich and free, and this is what leads them at times to be poor and enslaved.","It\'s better to bet on this life than on the next.","A man is more a man through the things he keeps to himself than through those he says.","Real generosity toward the future lies in giving all to the present.","I don\'t want to be a genius-I have enough problems just trying to be a man.","There always comes a time when one must choose between contemplation and action. This is called becoming a man.","If we believe in nothing, if nothing has any meaning and if we can affirm no values whatsoever, then everything is possible and nothing has any importance.","Find your happiness in yourself.","One recognizes one\'s course by discovering the paths that stray from it.","Stupidity has a knack of getting its way.","We do not know how to eliminate evil, but we do know how to feed some of the hungry and heal some of the infirmed.","The slave begins by demanding justice and ends by wanting to wear a crown.","After awhile you could get used to anything.","If it adapts itself to what the majority of our society wants, art will be a meaningless recreation.","If something is going to happen to me, I want to be there.","But above all, in order to be, never try to seem.","There is no shame in preferring happiness.","Believe me there is no such thing as great suffering, great regret, great memory....everything is forgotten, even a great love. That\'s what\'s sad about life, and also what\'s wonderful about it. There is only a way of looking at things, a way that comes to you every once in a while. That\'s why it\'s good to have had love in your life after all, to have had an unhappy passion- it gives you an alibi for the vague despairs we all suffer from.","When the soul suffers too much, it develops a taste for misfortune.","Perhaps we cannot prevent this world from being a world in which children are tortured. But we can reduce the number of tortured children.","If those whom we begin to love could know us as we were before meeting them they could perceive what they have made of us.","The truth is that everyone is bored, and devotes himself to cultivating habits.","On certain mornings, as we turn a corner,\\nan exquisite dew falls on our heart\\nand then vanishes.\\nBut the freshness lingers, and this, always,\\nis what the heart needs.\\nThe earth must have risen in just such a light\\nthe morning the world was born.","This world, such as it is, is not tolerable. Therefore I need the moon, or happiness, or immortality, I need something which is perhaps demented, but which is not of this world.","That is love, to give away everything, to sacrifice everything, without the slightest desire to get anything in return.3","We all carry within us places of exile, our crimes, our ravages. Our task is not to unleash them on the world; it is to transform them in ourselves and others.","Idleness is fatal only to the mediocre.","When you have once seen the glow of happiness on the face of a beloved person, you know that a man can have no vocation but to awaken that light on the faces surrounding him. In the depth of winter, I finally learned that within me there lay an invincible summer.","Seeking what is true is not seeking what is desirable.","The tragedy is not that we are alone, but that we cannot be. At times I would give anything in the world to no longer be connected by anything to this universe of men.","Forever I shall be a stranger to myself. In psychology as in logic, there are truths but no truth.","People hasten to judge in order not to be judged themselves.","We all have a weakness for beauty.","I may not have been sure about what really did interest me, but I was absolutely sure about what didn\'t.","The modern mind is in complete disarray. Knowledge has stretched itself to the point where neither the world nor our intelligence can find any foot-hold. It is a fact that we are suffering from nihilism.","It is easy to shield the outer body from poisoned arrows, but it is impossible to shield the mind from the poisoned darts that originate within itself. Greed, anger, foolishness and the infatuations of egoism - these four poisoned darts originate within the mind and infect it with deadly poison.","When there is no hope, one must invent hope.","Too many have dispensed with generosity in order to practice charity.","An intellectual? Yes. And never deny it. An intellectual is someone whose mind watches itself. I like this, because I am happy to be both halves, the watcher and the watched. \\"Can they be brought together?\\" This is a practical question. We must get down to it. \\"I despise intelligence\\" really means: \\"I cannot bear my doubts.","When the imagination sleeps, words are emptied of their meaning: a deaf population absent-mindedly registers the condemnation of a man. ... there is no other solution but to speak out and show the obscenity hidden under the verbal cloak.","Always there comes an hour when one is weary of one\'s work and devotion to duty, and all one craves for is a loved face, the warmth and wonder of a loving heart.","Everything considered, a determined soul will always manage.","You will never be happy if you continue to search for what happiness consists of. You will never live if you are looking for the meaning of life.","Don\'t believe your friends when they ask you to be honest with them. All they really want is to be maintained in the good opinion they have of themselves.","To be happy, we must not be too concerned with others.","Without work, all life goes rotten. But when work is soulless, life stifles and dies.","\u2026there\'s no question of heroism in all this. It\'s a matter of common decency. That\'s an idea which may make some people smile, but the only means of fighting a plague is - common decency.","No matter how the sun shone, the sea held forth no more promises.","...the habit of despair is worse than despair itself.","What is human in me is not what is best in me. What is human in me is that I desire, and to obtain what I desire, I believe I would crush anything that stood in my way.","Beauty is unbearable, drives us to despair, offering us for a minute the glimpse of an eternity that we should like to stretch out over the whole of time.","Healthy people have a natural skill of avoiding feverish eyes.","After all manner of professors have done their best for us, the place we are to get knowledge is in books. The true university of these days is a collection of books.","Life should be lived to the point of tears","That\'s love, giving everything, sacrificing all without hope of return.","Accepting the absurdity of everything around us is one step, a necessary experience: it should not become a dead end. It arouses a revolt that can become fruitful","We turn toward God only to obtain the impossible.","Freedom is not a reward or a decoration that is celebrated with champagne...Oh no! It\'s a...long distance race, quite solitary and very exhausting.","In order to understand the world, one has to turn away from it on occasion.","She was waiting, but she didn\'t know for what. She was aware only of her solitude, and of the penetrating cold, and of a greater weight in the region of her heart.","There is in me an anarchy and frightful disorder. Creating makes me die a thousand deaths, because it means making order, and my entire being rebels against order. But without it I would die, scattered to the winds.","I know simply that the sky will last longer than I.","Autumn is a second spring when every leaf is a flower.","I make myself strict rules in order to correct my nature. But it is my nature that I finally obey.","He who despairs of the human condition is a coward, but he who has hope for it is a fool.","In the depths of winter, I finally learned that within me there lay an invincible summer.","No one who lives in the sunlight of gratitude that things aren\'t worse makes a failure of his or her life.","There is a life and there is a death, and there are beauty and melancholy between.","All great deeds and all great thoughts have a ridiculous beginning.","We are all special cases.","Capital punishment is the most premeditated of murders.","There is scarcely any passion without struggle.","The purpose of a writer is to keep civilization from destroying itself.","It is not humiliating to be unhappy. Physical suffering is sometimes humiliating, but the suffering of being cannot be, it is life.","Integrity has no need of rules.","I can feel this heart inside me and I conclude it exists. I can touch this world and I also conclude that it exists. All my knowledge ends at this point. The rest is hypothesis.","Believe me, religions are on the wrong track the moment they moralize and fulminate commandments. God is not needed to create guilt or to punish. Our fellow men suffice, aided by ourselves.","Women are all we know of paradise on this earth.","Sometimes at night I would sleep open-eyed underneath a sky dripping with stars. I was alive then.","Man stands face to face with the irrational. He feels within him his longing for happiness and for reason. The absurd is born of this confrontation between the human need and the unreasonable silence of the world.","In order to speak about all and to all, one has to speak of what all know and of the reality common to us all. The sea, rains, necessity, desire, the struggle against death... these are things that unite us all.","A person I knew used to divide human beings into three categories: those who prefer to have nothing to hide rather than being obliged to lie, those who prefer lying to having nothing to hide, and finally those who like both lying and the hidden.","A loveless world is a dead world.","The real 19th century prophet was Dostoevsky, not Karl Marx.","What\u2019s true of all the evils in the world is true of plague as well. It helps men to rise above themselves.","It is not the world that is absurd, nor human thought: the absurd arises when the human need to understand meets the unreasonableness of the world, when \'my appetite for the absolute and for unity\' meets \'the impossibility of reducing this world to a rational and reasonable principle.\'","It takes time to live. Like any work of art, life needs to be thought about.","Like great works, deep feelings always mean more than they are conscious of saying.","Every time I hear a political speech or I read those of our leaders, I am horrified at having, for years, heard nothing which sounded human. It is always the same words telling the same lies.","Art does not tolerate reason.","Believe me, the hardest thing for a man to give up is that which he really doesn\'t want, after all.","Thoughts of suicide have got me through many a bad night.","An achievement is a bondage. It obliges one to a higher achievement.","At the heart of all beauty lies something inhuman, and these hills, the softness of the sky, the outline of these trees at this very minute lose the illusory meaning with which we had clothed them, henceforth more remote than a lost paradise . . . that denseness and that strangeness of the world is absurd.","Love cannot accept what it is. Everywhere on earth it cries out against kindness, compassion, intelligence, everything that leads to compromise. Love demands the impossible, the absolute, the sky on fire, inexhaustible springtime, life after death, and death itself transfigured into eternal life.","Lying is not only saying what isn\'t true. It is also, in fact especially, saying more than is true and, in the case of the human heart, saying more than one feels. We all do it, every day, to make life simpler.","Ah cher ami, how poor in invention men are! They are They always think one commits suicide for a reason. But it\'s quite possible to commit suicide for two reasons. No, that never occurs to them. So what\'s the good of dying intentionally, of sacrificing yourself to the idea you want people to have of you? Once you are dead, they will take advantage of it to attribute idiotic or vulgar motives to your action. Martyrs, cher ami, must choose between being forgotten, mocked, or made use of. As for being understood--never!","Truth, like light, blinds. Falsehood, on the contrary, is a beautiful twilight that enhances every object.","Man cannot do without beauty, and this is what our era pretends to want to disregard.","You have so much inside you, and the noblest happiness of all. Don\u2019t just wait for a man to come along. That\u2019s the mistake so many women make. Find your happiness in yourself.","Every act of rebellion expresses a nostalgia for innocence and an appeal to the essence of being.","Truth, like light, is blinding. Lies, on the other hand, are a beautiful dusk, which enhances the value of each object.","The realization that life is absurd and cannot be an end, but only a beginning. This is a truth nearly all great minds have taken as their starting point. It is not this discovery that is interesting, but theconsequences and rules of action drawn from it.","She was wearing a pair of my pajamas with the sleeves rolled up. When she laughed I wanted her again. A minute later she asked me if I loved her. I told her it didn\'t mean anything but that I didn\'t think so. She looked sad. But as we were fixing lunch, and for no apparent reason, she laughed in such a way that I kissed her.","I always found misogyny vulgar and stupid, and I found almost all the women I have known to be my betters. However, placing them so high, I used them more often than I served them. How does one make sense of this?","One always has exaggerated ideas about what one doesn\'t know.","Imagination offers people consolation for what they cannot be, and humor for what they actually are.","Peace is the only battle worth waging.","Happiness implied a choice, and within that choice a concerted will, a lucid desire.","But it\'s not easy. I\'ve been thinking it over for years. While we loved each other we didn\'t need words to make ourselves understood. But people don\'t love forever. A time came when I should have found the words to keep her with me, only I couldn\'t.","We have to live and let live in order to create what we are.","I know that man is capable of great deeds. But if he isn\'t capable of great emotion, well, he leaves me cold.","Those who prefer their principles over their happiness, they refuse to be happy outside the conditions they seem to have attached to their happiness.","Men must live and create. Live to the point of tears.","He had been bored, that\'s all, bored like most people. Hence he had made himself out of whole cloth a life full of complications and drama. Something must happen - and that explains most human commitments. Something must happen, even loveless slavery, even war or death. Hurray then for funerals!","The world in which we were called to exist was an absurd world, and there was no other in which we could take refuge.","When silence or tricks of language contribute to maintaining an abuse that must be reformed or a suffering that can be relieved, then there is no other solution but to speak out and show the obscenity hidden under the verbal cloak.","Fancy language, like poplin, too often conceals an eczema.","Morality, when formal, devours.","Happiness is generous. It does not subsist on destruction.","Judging whether life is or is not worth living amounts to answering the fundamental question of philosophy.","If the world were clear, art would not exist.","I\'d have given ten conversations with Einstein for a first meeting with a pretty chorus girl.","I opened myself to the gentle indifference of the world.","In order to exist, man must rebel.","Madness such as this, its like trying to stop a fire with the moisture from a kiss","On the ridge where the great artist moves forward, every step is an adventure, an extreme risk. In that risk, however, and only there, lays the freedom of Art.","I said that the world is absurd, but I was too hasty. This world in itself is not reasonable, that is all that can be said. But what is absurd is the confrontation of this irrational and the wild longing for clarity whose call echoes in the human heart.","We have art in order not to die of life.","We get into the habit of living before acquiring the habit of thinking.","The urge to revolt is one of the essential dimensions of human nature.","Love is the kind of illness that does not spare the intelligent or the dull.","You have to be very rich or very poor to live without a trade.","The most knowledgeable person in one domain may be the most ignorant in another.","And never have I felt so deeply at one and the same time so detached from myself and so present in the world.","Great ideas, it has been said, come into the world as gently as doves. Perhaps then, if we listen attentively, we shall hear amid the uproar of empires and nations, a faint flutter of wings, the gentle stirring of life and hope. Some will say that this hope lies in a nation; others in a man. I believe rather that it is awakened, revived, nourished, by millions of solitary individuals whose and works every day negate frontiers and the crudest implications of history.","But sometimes it takes more courage to live than to shoot yourself.","All I maintain is that on this earth there are pestilences and there are victims, and it\'s up to us, so far as possible, not to join forces with the pestilences. That may sound simple to the point of childishness; I can\'t judge if it\'s simple, but I know it\'s true.","It is in the thick of calamity that one gets hardened to the truth - in other words, to silence.","Nothing in life is worth, turning your back on, if you love it.","Men are never convinced of your reasons, of your sincerity, of the seriousness of your sufferings, except by your death. So long as you are alive, your case is doubtful; you have a right only to their skepticism.","If, after all, men cannot always make history have a meaning, they can always act so that their own lives have one.","There exists an obvious fact that seems utterly moral: namely, that a man is always prey to his truths. Once he has admitted them, he cannot free himself from them. One has to pay something. A man who has become conscious of the absurd is forever bound to it.","After another moment\'s silence she mumbled that I was peculiar, that that was probably why she loved me but that one day I might disgust her for the very same reason.","Martyrs, my friend, have to choose between being forgotten, mocked or used. As for being understood - never.","A true masterpiece does not tell everything.","You always get exaggerated notions of things you don\'t know anything about.","You know, a man always judges himself by the balance he can strike between the needs of his body and the demands of his mind. You\'re judging yourself now, Mersaut, and you don\'t like the sentence.","But, you know, I feel more fellowship with the defeated than with saints. Heroism and sanctity don\'t really appeal to me, I imagine. What interests me is being a man.","I can negate everything of that part of me that lives on vague nostalgias, except this desire for unity, this longing to solve, this need for clarity and cohesion. I can refute everything in this world surrounding me that offends or enraptures me, except this chaos, this sovereign chance and this divine equivalence which springs from anarchy. I don\'t know whether this world has meaning that transcends it. But I know that I do not know that meaning and that it is impossible for me just now to know it. What can a meaning outside my condition mean to me? I can understand only in human terms.","I looked up at the mass of signs and stars in the night sky and laid myself open for the first time to the benign indifference of the world.","We are all exceptional cases. We all want to appeal against something! Each of us insists on being innocent at all cost, even if he has to accuse the whole human race and heaven itself.","Without freedom, no art; art lives only on the restraints it imposes on itself, and dies of all others.","When one has extensively pondered about men, as a career or as a vocation, one sometimes feels nostalgic for primates. At least they do not have ulterior motives.","The look of success, when it is worn a certain way, would infuriate a jackass.","It is a well-known fact that we always recognize our homeland at the moment we are about to lose it.","To abandon oneself to principles is really to die - and to die for an impossible love which is the contrary of love.","All I know of morality I learned from football","It\'s a kind of spiritual snobbery that makes people think they can be happy without money.","Camus himself described this work as \'an attempt to understand the time I live in\'.","To be born to create, to love, to win at games is to be born to live in time of peace. But war teaches us to lose everything and become what we were not. It all becomes a question of style.","Every great work makes the human face more admirable and richer, and this is its whole secret.","The only serious question in life is whether to kill yourself or not.","Thinking is learning all over again how to see, directing one\'s consciousness, making of every image a privileged place.","I see many people die because they judge that life is not worth living. I see others paradoxically getting killed for the ideas or illusions that give them a reason for living (what is called a reason for living is also an excellent reason for dying). I therefore conclude that the meaning of life is the most urgent of questions.","It\'s not the struggle that makes us artists, but Art that makes us struggle.","Of course, true love is exceptional - two or three times a century, more or less. The rest of the time there is vanity or boredom.","Art and revolt will die only with the last man.","I sometimes need to write things which I cannot completely control but which therefore prove that what is in me is stronger than I am.","Once crime was as solitary as a cry of protest; now it is as universal as science. Yesterday it was put on trial; today it determines the law.","As a remedy to life in society I would suggest the big city. Nowadays, it is the only desert within our means.","I am too much in love with my lies and hypocrisies not to confess them fervently.","Somebody has to have the last word. If not, every argument could be opposed by another and we\'d never be done with it.","People don\'t love each other at our age, Marthe\u2014they please each other, that\'s all. Later on, when you\'re old and impotent, you can love someone. At our age, you just think you do. That\'s all it is.","For if there is a sin against life, it consists perhaps not so much in despairing of life as in hoping for another life and in eluding the implacable grandeur of this life.","The only real progress lies in learning to be wrong all alone.","I have never been able, really, to regret anything in all my life. I have always been far much too absorbed in the present moment or the immediate future to think back.","For a man who loves power, competition from the gods is annoying. I have done away with that. I have proven to these illusory godsthat a man, if he has the will, can practice, without any apprenticeship, their ridiculous trade.","... one cannot be happy in exile or in oblivion. One cannot always be a stranger. I want to return to my homeland, make all my loved ones happy. I see no further than this.","Thus, in a middle course between these heights and depths, they drifted through life rather than lived, the prey of aimless days and sterile memories, like wandering shadows that could have acquired substance only by consenting to root themselves in the solid earth of their distress.","An intellectual is someone whose mind watches itself.","The innocent is the person who explains nothing","It is better to burn than to disappear.","History only exists, in the final analysis, for God.","The aim of art, the aim of a life can only be to increase the sum of freedom and responsibility to be found in every man and in the world. It cannot, under any circumstances, be to reduce or suppress that freedom, even temporarily.","A lot of jobs don\'t allow you to be who you are. There is dignity in work only when it is work freely accepted.","In a world that has ceased to believe in sin, the artist is responsible for the preaching.","Freedom is nothing but a chance to be better.","I am too far away from what I love and my distance is without remedy.","We used to wonder where war lived, what it was that made it so vile. And now we realize that we know where it lives... inside ourselves.","Whatever prevents you from doing your work has become your work.","I like people who dream or talk to themselves interminably; I like them, for they are double. They are here and elsewhere.","To lose the touch of flowers and women\'s hands is the supreme separation.","A man wants to earn money in order to be happy, and his whole effort and the best of a life are devoted to the earning of that money. Happiness is forgotten; the means are taken for the end.","Without memories, without hope, they lived for the moment only. indeed, the here and now had come to mean everything to them. For there is no denying that the plague had gradually killed off in all of us the faculty not of love only but even of friendship. Naturally enough, since love asks something of the future, and nothing was left us but a series of present moments.","Happiness too is inevitable.","The Poor Man whom everyone speaks of, the Poor Man whom everyone pities, one of the repulsive Poor from whom charitable souls keep their distance, he has still said nothing. Or, rather, he has spoken through the voice of Victor Hugo, Zola, Richepin. At least, they said so. And these shameful impostures fed their authors. Cruel irony, the Poor Man tormented with hunger feeds those who plead his case.","But who would dare condemn me in this world with no judges, where no one is innocent!","There was a time when I didn\u2019t at any minute have the slightest idea how I could reach the next one. Yes, one can wage war in this world, ape love, torture one\u2019s fellow man, or merely say evil of one\u2019s neighbour while knitting. But, in certain cases, carrying on, merely continuing, is superhuman.","To live is in itself a value judgment. To breathe is to judge.","The love of God is a hard love. It demands total self-surrender, disdain of our human personality. And yet it alone can reconcile us to suffering and the deaths of children, it alone can justify them, since we cannot understand them, and we can only make God\'s will ours.","To me, art is not a solitary delight. It is a means of stirring the greatest number of men by providing them with a privileged image of our common joys and woes.","Freedom is not a reward or a decoration that you toast in champagne. On the contrary, it\'s hard graft and a long-distance run, all alone, very exhausting. Alone in a dreary room, alone in the dock before the judges, and alone to make up your mind, before yourself and before the judgement of others. At the end of every freedom there is a sentence, which is why freedom is too heavy to bear.","Culture: the cry of men in face of their destiny.","What is a rebel? A man who says no: but whose refusal does not imply a renunciation.","You make the mistake of thinking you have to choose, that you have to do what you want, that there are conditions for happiness. What matters \u2014 all that matters, really is the will to happiness, a kind of enormous, ever present consciousness. The rest - women , art, success \u2014 is nothing but excuses. A canvas waiting for our embroideries.","To feel absolutely right is the beginning of the end.","For the first time, the first, I laid my heart open to the benign indifference of the universe. To feel it so like myself, indeed so brotherly, made me realize that I\'d been happy, and that I was happy still.","The opposite of an idealist is too often a man without love.","There is a solitude in poverty, but a solitude which restores to each thing its value.","I don\u2019t know whether this world has a meaning that transcends it. But I know that I cannot know that meaning and that it is impossible for me just now to know it.","There is merely bad luck in not being loved; there is misfortune in not loving. All of us, today, are dying of this misfortune. For violence and hatred dry up the heart itself; the long fight for justice exhausts the love that nevertheless gave birth to it.","A man devoid of hope and conscious of being so has ceased to belong to the future.","Where there is no hope, it is incumbent on us to invent it.","Only it takes time to be happy. A lot of time. Happiness, too, is a long patience.","There is but one truly serious philosophical problem and that is suicide.","Poverty, first of all was never a misfortune for me; it was radiant with sunlight.. I owe it to my family, first of all, who lacked everything and who envied practically nothing.","A guilty conscience needs to confess. A work of art is a confession.","To lose one\'s life is no great matter; when the time comes I\'ll have the courage to lose mine. But what\'s intolerable is to see one\'s life being drained of meaning, to be told there\'s no reason for existing. A man can\'t live without some reason for living.","We always deceive ourselves twice about the people we love - first to their advantage, then to their disadvantage.","To know oneself, one should assert oneself.","At the heart of all beauty lies something inhuman.","No excuses ever, for anyone; that is my principle at the outset. I deny the good intention, the respectable mistake, the indiscretion, the extenuating circumstance. With me there is no giving of absolution or blessing.","The most exhausting effort in my life has been to suppress my own nature in order to make it serve my biggest plans.","With rebellion, awareness is born","The nobility of our calling will always be rooted in two commitments difficult to observe: refusal to lie about what we know, and resistance to oppression.","Men and women consume one another rapidly in what is called \\"the act of love,\\" or else settle down to a mild habit of conjugality. We seldom find a mean between these two extremes.","To create is likewise to give a shape to one\'s fate","When I was young, I expected from people more than they could give: neverending friendship and constant excitement. Now I expect less than they can actually can give: to stay close silently. And their feelings, friendship, noble deeds always seem like a miracle to me: a true grace.","Violence is both unavoidable and unjustifiable.","Truly fertile Music, the only kind that will move us, that we shall truly appreciate, will be a Music conducive to Dream, which banishes all reason and analysis. One must not wish first to understand and then to feel. Art does not tolerate Reason.","There are people who vindicate the world, who help others live just by their presence.","In that daily effort in which intelligence and passion mingle and delight each other, the absurd man discovers a discipline that will make up the greatest of his strengths. The required diligence and doggedness and lucidity thus resemble the conqueror\'s attitude. To create is likewise to give a shape to one\'s fate. For all these characters, their work defines them at least as much as it is defined by them. The actor taught us this: There is no frontier between being and appearing.","I was assailed by memories of a life that wasn\'t mine anymore, but one in which I\'d found the simplest and most lasting joys.","No matter what cause one defends, it will suffer permanent disgrace if one resorts to blind attacks on crowds of innocent people.","Truth is mysterious, elusive, always to be conquered. Liberty is dangerous, as hard to live with as it is elating. We must march toward these two goals, painfully but resolutely, certain in advance of our failings on so long a road.","We\'re going forward, but nothing changes.","You must have a love, a great love, to ensure an alibi at unjustified despairs that conquer all of us","I was always able to understand my friend who decided to quit smoking and who, through an effort of will, succeeded in doing so. One morning, he opened the newspaper, read that the first H- bomb had exploded, found out about the bomb\'s admirable effects and went straight to the tobacconist\'s.","Rebellion, in man, is the refusal to be treated as an object and to be reduced to simple historical terms. It is the affirmation of a nature common to all men, which eludes the world of power.","There can be no true goodness, nor true love, without the utmost clear-sightedness.","There is no frontier between being and appearing.","But - I cannot make a choice. I have my own sorrow, but I suffer with him, too; I share his pain. I understand all - that is my trouble.","For those of us who have been thrown into hell, mysterious melodies and the torturing images of a vanished beauty will always bring us, in the midst of crime and folly, the echo of that harmonious insurrection which bears witness, throughout the centuries, to the greatness of humanity.","The act of love is a confession.","In the world there is, parallel to the force of death and constraint, an enormous force of persuasion that is called culture.","The slave and those whose present life is miserable and who can find no consolation in the heavens are assured that at least the future belongs to them. The future is the only kind of property that the masters willingly concede to the slaves.","Obstinacy alone is not a virtue.","The best are led to make greater demands upon themselves. As for those who succumb, they did not deserve to survive.","Proof is never definitive, after all; one has to begin again with each new person.","I felt that I had been happy and that I was happy again. For everything to be consummated, for me to feel less alone, I had only to wish that there be a large crowd of spectators the day of my execution and that they greet me with cries of hate.","All healthy men have thought of their own suicide","... unhappiness is like marriage. We believe we chose it, but then it is choosing us. That is how it is, we can do nothing about it.","There is no more futile punishment than futile and hopeless labor.","Great novelists are philosopher novelists - that is, the contrary of thesis-writers.","One must imagine Sisyphus happy.","We turn our backs on nature; we are ashamed of beauty. Our wretched tragedies have a smell of the office clinging to them, and the blood that trickles from them is the color of printer\'s ink.","There are people who prefer to look their fate in the eye","All great deeds and all great thoughts have a ridiculous beginning. Great works are often born on a street corner or in a restaurant\'s revolving door.","Purely historical thought is therefore nihilistic: it wholeheartedly accepts the evil of history and in this way is opposed to rebellion.","Yes, and when the love of life disappears, no meaning can console us.","The absurd hero\'s refusal to hope becomes his singular ability to live in the present with passion.","He was conscious of the disastrous fact that love and desire must be expressed in the same way.","As for those whose role it is to love us - I mean, relatives and in-laws (what a word)- It\'s a different tune. They find the right word, but it\'s usually the one that wounds.","For years I\'ve wanted to live according to everyone else\'s morals. I\'ve forced myself to live like everyone else, to look like everyone else. I said what was necessary to join together, even when I felt separate. And after all of this, catastrophe came. Now I wander amid the debris, I am lawless, torn to pieces, alone and accepting to be so, resigned to my singularity and to my infirmities. And I must rebuild a truth-after having lived all my life in a sort of lie.","It is immoral not to tell.","In our well-policed society we recognize that an illness is serious from the fact that we don\'t dare speak of it directly.","A work of art is a confession.","Thinking of the future, establishing aims for oneself, having preferences-all this presupposes a belief in freedom, even if one occasionally ascertains that one doesn\'t feel it.","...we rarely confide in those who are better than we. Rather, we are more inclined to flee their society. Most often, on the other hand, we confess to those who are like us and who share our weaknesses. Hence we don\'t want to improve ourselves and be bettered, for we should first have to be judged in default. We merely wish to be pitied and encouraged in the course we have chosen. In short, we should like, at the same time, to cease being guilty and yet not to make the effort of cleansing ourselves.","The society of merchants can be defined as a society in which things disappear in favor of signs. When a ruling class measures its fortunes, not by the acre of land or the ingot of gold, but by the number of figures corresponding ideally to a certain number of exchange operations, it thereby condemns itself to setting a certain kind of humbug at the center of its experience and its universe. A society founded on signs is, in its essence, an artificial society in which man\'s carnal truth is handled as something artificial.","I grew up with the sea, and poverty for me was sumptuous; then I lost the sea and found all luxuries gray and poverty unbearable.","Do not be surprised. I do not like writers and I cannot stand their lies. They speak so as not to listen to themselves speak. If they did listen, they would know that they are nothing and then they would no longer be able to speak.","The work of art is born of the intelligence\'s refusal to reason the concrete.  It marks the triumph of the carnal.","No ends, simply means.","I felt as I hadn\'t felt for ages. I had a foolish desire to burst into tears. for the first time I\'d realized how all these people loathed me.","There are crimes of passion and crimes of logic. The boundary between them is not clearly defined.","For what gives value to travel is fear. It breaks down a kind of inner structure we have. Travel robs us of such refuge. Far from our own people, our own language, stripped of all our props, deprived of our masks (one doesn\'t know the fare on the streetcars, or anything else), we are completely on the surface of ourselves.","For instance, I never complained that my birthday was overlooked; people were even surprised, with a touch of admiration, by my discretion on this subject. But the reason for my disinterestedness was even more discreet: I longed to be forgotten in order to be able to complain to myself... Once my solitude was thoroughly proved, I could surrender to the charms of a virile self-pity.","Instead of killing and dying in order to produce the being that we are not, we have to live and let live in order to create what we are.","Freedom is not a gift received from the State or leader, but a possession to be won every day by the effort of each and the union of all.","My life was lucky so that I met, I loved (and disappointed) only outstanding people.","For rich people, the sky is just an extra, a gift of nature. The poor, on the other hand, can see it as it is, a gift of infinite grace.","I know myself too well to believe in pure virtue.","There is not one talent for living and another for creating. The same suffices for both. And one can be sure that the talent that could not produce but an artificial work could not sustain but a frivolous life.","A taste for truth at any cost is a passion which spares nothing.","In art, rebellion is consummated and perpetuated in the act of real creation, not in criticism or commentary.","I do not believe in God and I am not an atheist.","To remain a man in today\'s world, one must have not only unfailing energy and unwavering intensity, one must also have a little luck.","The artist forges himself to the others, midway between the beauty he cannot do without and the community he cannot tear himself away from. That is why true artists scorn nothing: they are obliged to understand rather than to judge.","The most elementary form of rebellion, paradoxically , expresses an aspiration for order .","I draw from the Absurd three consequences: my revolt, my liberty, my passion.","The gods had condemned Sisyphus to ceaselessly rolling a rock to the top of a mountain, whence the stone would fall back of its own weight. They had thought with some reason that there is no more dreadful punishment than futile and hopeless labor.","He was expressing his certainty that my appeal would be granted, but I was carrying the burden of a sin from which I had to free myself. According to him, human justice was nothing and divine justice was everything. I pointed out it was the former that had condemned me.","True debauchery is liberating because it creates no obligations. In it you possess only yourself, hence it remains the favorite pastime of the great lovers of their own person.","There is only one class of men, the privileged class","To understand one\'s world, one must sometimes turn away from it! To serve better, one must briefly hold it at a distance. Where can the necessary solitude be found, the long breathing space in which mind gathers its strength and takes stock of its courage.","A man\'s work is nothing but this slow trek to rediscover, through the detours of art, those two or three great and simple images in whose presence his heart first opened.","By definition, a government has no conscience. Sometimes it has a policy, but nothing more.","More and more, when faced with the world of men, the only reaction is one of individualism. Man alone is an end unto himself. Everything one tries to do for the common good ends in failure.","The loss of love is the loss of all rights, even though one had them all.","I have never been able to renounce the light, the pleasure of being, and the freedom in which I grew up.","I cling like a miser to the freedom that disappears as soon as there is an excess of things.","There is nothing abstract about pain. It is specific, it is real, and, when it is intense, it is world destroying.","Any country where I am not bored is a country that teaches me nothing.","Life continues, and some mornings, weary of the noise, discouraged by the prospect of the interminable work to keep after, sickened also by the madness of the world that leaps at you from the newspaper, finally convinced that I will not be equal to it and that I will disappoint everyone - all I want to do is sit down and wait for evening. This is what I feel like, and sometimes I yield to it.","There\'s the risk of being loved...and that would keep me from being happy.","Liberty is dangerous, as hard to get along with as it is exciting.","The absurd is the essential concept and the first truth.","Today we are always as ready to judge as we are to fornicate.","We are not so mad as to think that we shall create a world in which murder will not occur. We are fighting for a world in which murder will no longer be legal.","Intelligence in chains loses in lucidity what it gains in intensity.","To two men living the same number of years, the world always provides the same sum of experiences. It is up to us to be conscious of them.","There is so much stubborn hope in the human heart.","But what are a hundred million deaths? When one has served in a war, one hardly knows what a dead man is, after a while. And since a dead man has no substance unless one has actually seen him dead, a hundred million corpses broadcast through history are no more than a puff of smoke in the imagination.","I spent a long time looking at faces, drinking in smiles. Am I happy or unhappy? It\u2019s not a very important question. I live with such frenzied intensity. Things and people are waiting for me, and doubtless I am waiting for them and desiring them with all my strength and sadness. But, here, I earn the right to be alive by silence and by secrecy. The miracle of not having to talk about oneself.","In the vast reaches of the dry, cold night, thousands of stars were constantly appearing, and their sparkling icicles, loosened at once, began to slip gradually toward the horizon.","Old women even forget how to love their sons. The heart gets worn out, Monsieur.","He knew now that it was his own will to happiness which must make the next move. But if he was to do so, he realized that he must come to terms with time, that to have time was at once the most magnificent and the most dangerous of experiments. Idleness is fatal only to the mediocre.","We are living in the era of premeditation and the perfect crime. Our criminals are no longer helpless children who could plead love as their excuse. On the contrary, they are adults and the have the perfect alibi: philosophy, which can be used for any purpose - even for transforming murderers into judges.","We must learn how to lend ourselves to dreaming when dreams lend themselves to us.","I\'d buy myself a cabin on the beach, I\'d put some glue in my navel, and I\'d stick a flag in there. Then I\'d wait to see which way the wind was blowing.","Life can be magnificent and overwhelming -- that is the whole tragedy. Without beauty, love, or danger it would almost be easy to live.","The act of love . . . is a confession. Selfishness screams aloud, vanity shows off, or else true generosity reveals itself.","Greatness consists in trying to be great. There is no other way.","I do not have much liking for the too famous existential philosophy, and, to tell the truth, I think its conclusions false.","There is always a certain hour of the day and of the night when a man\u2019s courage is at its lowest ebb, and it was that hour only that he feared.","Those who write clearly have readers.","My chief occupation, despite appearances, has always been love.","Ah, mon cher, for anyone who is alone, without God and without a master, the weight of days is dreadful.","Heroism is accessible. Happiness is more difficult.","In the end, we would like not to be guilty while at the same time being dispensed of the effort of purifying ourselves. Not enough cynicism and not enough virtue.","The more I produce, the less I am certain. On the road along which the artist walks, night falls ever more densely. Finally, he dies blind.","I knew a pure heart who refused tot be mistrustful.... He had written at his doorstep: \\"From wherever you are, enter and be welcome\\". Who do you think responded to this lovely invitation? The militia, who made themselves at home and gutted him.","The most loathsome materialism is not the kind people usually think of, but the sort that attempts to let dead ideas pass for living realities, diverting into sterile myths the stubborn and lucid attention we give to what we have within us that must forever die.","Against eternal injustice, man must assert justice, and to protest against the universe of grief, he must create happiness.","All that I know most surely about morality and obligations I owe to football.","What would become of the world if the condemned started to confide their heartaches to the executioners?","Indeed, men never know how to love. nothing satisfies them. All they know is to dream, to imagine new duties, to look for new countries and new homes. While we women, we know that we must hasten to love, to share the same bed, hold hands, and fear absence. When we women love, we dream of nothing.","There is but one truly serious philosophical problem and that is suicide. Judging whether life is or is not worth living amounts to answering the fundamental question of philosophy. All the rest \u2014 whether or not the world has three dimensions, whether the mind has nine or twelve categories \u2014 comes afterwards. These are games; one must first answer.","I feel like getting married, or committing suicide, or subscribing to L\'Illustration. Something desperate, you know.","Rule: Start by looking for what is valid in every man.","Every stone here sweats with suffering, I know that. I have never looked at them without a feeling of anguish. But deep in my heart I know that the most wretched among you have seen a divine face emerge from their darkness. That is the face you are asked to see.","I love life - that\u2019s my real weakness. I love it so much that I am incapable of imagining what is not life.","The only really committed artist is he who, without refusing to take part in the combat, at least refuses to join the regular armies and remains a freelance.","One dies if necessary, one breaks rather than bending. But I bend, because I continue to love myself.","For there is merely bad luck in not being loved; there is misfortune in not loving.","The sense of doing good , the satisfaction of being right, the joy of looking favorably upon oneself, dear sir, are powerful levers for keeping us upright and making us progress. On the other hand, if men are deprived of that feeling, they are changed into rabid dogs.","We spend our days in deliberating, and we end them without coming to any resolve.","To think is first of all to create a world (or to limit one\'s own world, which comes to the same thing).","Artistic creation is a demand for unity and a rejection of the world.","Although it was the middle of winter, I finally realized that, within me, summer was inextinguishable.","It is always easy to be logical. It is almost impossible to be logical to the bitter end.","To create today is to create dangerously. Any publication is an act, and that act exposes one to the passions of an age that forgives nothing.","It is impossible to give a clear account of the world, but art can teach us to reproduce it-just as the world reproduces itself in the course of its eternal gyrations. The primordial sea indefatigably repeats the same words and casts up the same astonished beings on the same sea-shore.","Yes, there was an element of abstraction and unreality in misfortune. But when an abstraction starts to kill you, you have to get to work on it.","Every writer, big or small, needs to say or write that the genius is always hissed at by his contemporaries. Naturally, this is not true, it happens only occasionally and often by chance. But this need within the writer is enlightening.","The first choice an artist makes is precisely to be an artist, and if he chooses to be an artist it is in consideration of what he is himself and because of a certain idea he has of art","All men have a sweetness in their life. That is what helps them go on. It is towards that they turn when they feel too worn out.","Men like us are good and proud and strong...if we had a faith, a God, nothing could undermine us. But we had nothing, we had to learn everything, and living for honor alone has its weaknesses.","Why must one love rarely to love well?","I felt as though I was partly unlearning what i had never learned and yet knew so well: I mean, how to live.","A nihilist is not one who believes in nothing , but one who does not believe in what exists.","Capital punishment is the most premeditated of murders, to which no criminal\'s deed, however calculated can be compared. For there to be an equivalency, the death penalty would have to punish a criminal who had warned his victim of the date at which he would inflict a horrible death on him and who, from that moment onward, had confined him at his mercy for months. Such a monster is not encountered in private life.","Something must happen; that is the reason for most human relationships. Something must happen; even servitude in love, in war, ordeath.","It is not your paintings I like, it is your painting.","An intense feeling carries with it its own universe, magnificent or wretched as the case may be.","The best revenge you can have on intellectuals is to be madly happy.","I am just coming out of five years of night, and this orgy of violent lights gives me for the first time the impression of a new continent. An enormous, 50-foot high Camel billboard : a GI with his mouth wide open blows enormous puffs of real smoke. So much bad taste hardly seems imaginable.","Without culture, and the relative freedom it implies, society, even when perfect, is but a jungle. This is why any authentic creation is a gift to the future.","But too many people now climb onto the cross merely to be seen from a greater distance, even if they have to trample somewhat on the one who has been there so long.","I was tormented by my desire for a woman ... I thought so much about a woman, about women, about all the ones I had known, about all the circumstances in which I had enjoyed them, that my cell would be filled with their faces and crowded with my desires.","We [Raymond and Meursault] stared at each other without blinking, and everything came to a stop there between the sea, the sand, and the sun, and the double silence of the flute and the water. It was then that I realized that you could either shoot or not shoot.","Youth is above all a collection of possibilities.","Turbulent childhood, adolescent daydreams in the drone of the bus\'s motor, mornings, unspoiled girls, beaches, young muscles always at the peak of their effort, evening\'s slight anxiety in a sixteen-year-old-heart, lust for life, fame, and ever the same sky through the years, unfailing in strength and light, itself insatiable, consuming one by one over a period of months the victims stretched out in the form of crosses on the beach at the deathlike hour of noon.","There are plagues, and there are victims, and it\'s the duty of good men not to join forces with the plagues.","Everybody knows that pestilences have a way of recurring in the world; yet somehow we find it hard to believe in ones that crash down on our heads from a blue sky.","A profound thought is in a constant state of becoming; it adopts the experience of a life and assumes its shape.","Truth is not a virtue, but a passion. It is never charitable.","We [writers] must know that we can never escape the common misery and that our only justification, if indeed there is a justification, is to speak up, insofar as we can, for those who cannot do so.","What can a meaning outside my condition mean to me? I can understand only in human terms. What I touch, what resists me - that I understand. And these two certainties - my appetite for the absolute and for unity and the impossibility of reducing this world to a rational and reasonable principle - I also know that I cannot reconcile them. What other truth can I admit without lying, without bringing in a hope I lack and which means nothing within the limits of my conditions?","For the existentials, negation is their God. To be precise, that god is maintained only through the negation of human reason. But, like suicides, gods change with men.","When I see a new face, something sets off an alarm bell inside me. \'slow down! Danger!\' Even when the attraction is strongest, I am on my guard.","If absolute truth belongs to anyone in this world, it certainly does not belong to the man or party that claims to possess it.","Every authentic work of art is a gift offered to the future.","As soon as one does not kill oneself, one must keep silent about life.","Those who weep for the happy periods which they encounter in history acknowledge what they want; not the alleviation but the silencing of misery.","There is no love of life without despair of life.","To govern means to pillage, as everyone knows.","I knew that I had shattered the harmony of the day, the exceptional silence of a beach where I\'d been happy. Then I fired four more times at the motionless body where the bullets lodged without leaving a trace. And it was like knocking four quick times on the door of unhappiness.","Wandering seemed no more than the happiness of an anxious man.","From Pandora\'s Box, where all the ills of humanity swarmed, the Greeks drew out hope after all the others, as the most dreadful of all. I know no more stirring symbol; for, contrary to the general belief, hope equals resignation. And to live is not to resign oneself.","We can\'t do without dominating others or being served.... The essential thing, in sum, is being able to get angry without the other person being able to answer back.","It was as if that great rush of anger had washed me clean, emptied me of hope, and, gazing up at the dark sky spangled with its signs and stars, for the first time, the first, I laid my heart open to the benign indifference of the universe. To feel it so like myself, indeed, so brotherly, made me realize that I\'d been happy, and that I was happy still. For all to be accomplished, for me to feel less lonely, all that remained to hope was that on the day of my execution there should be a huge crowd of spectators and that they should greet me with howls of execration.","There can be no question of masking the evidence, of suppressing the absurd by denying one of the terms of its equation. It is essential to know whether one can live with it or whether, on the other hand, logic commands one to die of it.","It was in Spain that [my generation] learned that one can be right and yet be beaten, that force can vanquish spirit, that there are times when courage is not its own recompense. It is this, doubtless, which explains why so many, the world over, feel the Spanish drama as a personal tragedy.","A free press can, of course, be good or bad, but, most certainly without freedom, the press will never be anything but bad.","Do not wait for the Last Judgment. It takes place every day.","Mon cher ami, let\'s not give them any pretext, no matter how small, for judging us!!! Otherwise, we\'ll be left in shreds. We are forced to take the same precautions as the animal trainer. If, before going into the cage, he has the misfortune to cut himself while shaving, what a feast for the wild animals!!","I have a good, hearty laugh and an energetic handshake, and those are trump cards.","He had opened his heart to the sublime indifference of the universe","I leave Sisyphus at the foot of the mountain. One always finds one\'s burden again. But Sisyphus teaches the higher fidelity that negates the gods and raises rocks. He too concludes that all is well. This universe henceforth without a master seems to him neither sterile nor futile. Each atom of that stone, each mineral flake of that night-filled mountain, in itself, forms a world. The struggle itself toward the heights is enough to fill a man\'s heart. One must imagine Sisyphus happy.","If the descent is thus sometimes performed in sorrow, it can also take place in joy.","Absolute virtue is impossible and the republic of forgiveness leads, with implacable logic, to the republic of the guillotine.","I am not made for politics because I am incapable of wanting or accepting the death of the adversary.","In order to understand the world, one has to turn away from it on occasion; in order to serve others better, one has to hold them at a distance for a time. But where can one find the solitude necessary to vigor, the deep breath in which the mind collects itself and courage gauges its strength? There remain big cities.","Note, besides, that it is no more immoral to directly rob citizens than to slip indirect taxes into the price of goods that they cannot do without.","In this respect, our townsfolk were like everybody else, wrapped up in themselves; in other words, they were humanists: they disbelieved in pestilences. A pestilence isn\'t a thing made to man\'s measure; therefore we tell ourselves that pestilence is a mere bogy of the mind, a bad dream that will pass away. But it doesn\'t always pass away and, from one bad dream to another, it is men who pass away, and the humanists first of all, because they have taken no precautions.","Children will still die unjustly even in a perfect society. Even by his greatest effort, man can only propose to diminish, arithmetically, the sufferings of the world.","One might think, that a period which, within fifty years, uproots, enslaves or kills seventy million human beings, should only, and forthwith, be condemned. But also its guilt must be understood.","Europe has lived on its contradictions, flourished on its differences, and, constantly transcending itself thereby, has created a civilization on which the whole world depends even when rejecting it. This is why I do not believe in a Europe unified under the weight of an ideology or of a technocracy that overlooked these differences.","Human relationships always help us to carry on because they always presuppose further developments, a future - and also because we live as if our only task was precisely to have relationships with other people.","Nothing is given to mankind and what little men can conquer must be paid for with unjust death. But man\'s grandeur lies elsewhere, in his decision to rise above his condition.","We know the surrealist solution: concrete irrationality, objective risk. Poetry is the conquest, the only possible conquest, of the \'supreme position\', \'a certain position of the mind from where life and death, the real and the imaginary, the past and the future... cease to be perceived in a contradictory sense.\'","...Any authentic creation is a gift to the future.","How hard it is, how bitter it is to become a man!","...he said firmly, \\"God can help you. All the men I\u2019ve seen in your position turned to Him in their time of trouble.\\" \\"Obviously,\\" I replied, \\"they were at liberty to do so, if they felt like it.\\" I, however, didn\u2019t want to be helped, and I hadn\u2019t time to work up interest for something that didn\u2019t interest me.","Old married people look so much alike that they have the same number of hairs in their ears.","If man is reduced to being nothing but a character in history, he has no other choice but to subside into the sound and fury of acompletely irrational history or to endow history with the form of human reason.","What more ghastly image can be called up than that of a man betrayed by his body who, simply because he did not die in time, lives out the comedy while awaiting the end, face to face with that God he does not adore, serving him as he served life, kneeling before a void and arms outstretched toward a heaven without eloquence that he knows to be also without depth?","The French Revolution gave birth to no artists but only to a great journalist, Desmoulins, and to an under-the-counter writer, Sade. The only poet of the times was the guillotine.","Freedom of the press is perhaps the freedom that has suffered the most from the gradual degradation of the idea of liberty.","The desire for possession is insatiable, to such a point that it can survive even love itself. To love, therefore, is to sterilize the person one loves.","A character is never the author who created him. It is quite likely, however, that an author may be all his characters simultaneously.","Every artist preserves deep within him a single source from which, throughout his lifetime, he draws what he is, and what he says. When the source dries up, the work withers and crumbles.","Knowing what [Christ] knew , knowing all about mankind--ah! who would have thought that the crime is not so much to make others die, but to die oneself--confronted day and night with his innocent crime, it became too difficult to go on. It was better to get it over with, to not defend himself, to die, in order not to be the only one to have survived, and to go elsewhere, where, perhaps, he would be supported.","Most men are like me. They cannot live in a universe where the most bizarre thought can in one second enter into the realm of reality--where, most often, it does enter, like a knife in a heart.","Absurdism, like methodical doubt, has wiped the slate clean. It leaves us in a blind alley. But, like methodical doubt, it can, by returning upon itself, open up a new field of investigation, and in the process of reasoning then pursues the same course. I proclaim that I believe in nothing and that everything is absurd, but I cannot doubt the validity of my proclamation and I must at least believe in my protest.","I have a very old and very faithful attachment for dogs. I like them because they always forgive.","Whoever today speaks of human existence in terms of power, efficiency, and historical tasks is an actual or potential assassin.","People believe a man is in distress because his loved one dies in one day. But his real pain is less futile: it is that he finds out that sadness too does not last. Even pain has no meaning.","If pimps and thieves everywhere were always punished, honest people would all believe themselves always to be innocent.","If only nature is real and if, in nature, only desire and destruction are legitimate, then, in that all humanity does not suffice to assuage the thirst for blood, the path of destruction must lead to universal annihilation.","Beware of those who say: \\"I know this too well to be able to express it.\\" For if they cannot do so, this is because they don\'t know it or because out of laziness they stopped at the outer crust.","maybe she had become tired of being the girlfriend of a condemned man. It also occured to me that maybe she was sick, or dead. These things happen. [...] Anyway, after that, remembering Marie meant nothing to me. That seemed perfectly normal to me, since I understood very well that people would forget me when I was dead.","Modern conquerors can kill, but do not seem to be able to create. Artists know how to create but cannot really kill. Murderers are only very exceptionally found among artists.","stupidity has a knack of getting its way; as we should see if we were not always so much wrapped up in ourselves","Working conditions for me have always been those of the monastic life: solitude and frugality. Except for frugality, they are contrary to my nature, so much so that work is a violence I do to myself.","Murder is terribly exhausting.","On my way out I was even going to shake his hand, but I remembered just in time that I\'d killed a man.","I have always thought it would be easier to redeem a man steeped in vice and crime than a greedy, narrow-minded, pitiless merchant.","The absurd has meaning only in so far as it is not agreed to.","One cannot be a part-time nihilist.","Absolute freedom mocks at justice. Absolute justice denies freedom.","The role of the intellectual cannot be to excuse the violence of one side and condemn that of the other.","Who taught you all this, doctor?\\" The reply came promptly: \\"Suffering.","For the absurd man, it is not a matter of explaining and solving, but of experiencing and describing. Everything begins with lucid indifference.","Everyone would like to behave like a pagan, with everyone else behaving like a Christian.","But in order to speak about all and to all, one has to speak of what all know and of the reality common to us all. The seas, rains, necessity, desire, the struggle against death--these are things that unite us all. We resemble one another in what we see together, in what we suffer together. Dreams change from individual, but the reality of the world is common to us all. Striving towards realism is therefore legitimate, for it is basically related to the artistic adventure.","If God did not exist, we should have to invent him. If God did exist, we should have to abolish Him.","Some are created to love, while the others - to live.","Without freedom there is no art.","Analysis of rebellion leads at least to the suspicion that, contrary to the postulates of contemporary thought, a human nature does exist, as the Greeks believed. Why rebel if there is nothing permanent in oneself worth preserving? ... Rebellion, though apparently negative, since it creates nothing, is profoundly positive in that it reveals the part of man which must always be defended.","Beginning to think is beginning to be undermined.","Alas, after a certain age every man is responsible for his face.","Outside of that single fatality of death, everything, joy or happiness, is liberty.","The danger of lectures is that they create the illusion of teaching for teachers, and the illusion of learning for learners.","Have you no hope at all? And do you really live with the thought that when you die, you die, and nothing remains?\\" \\"Yes,\\" I said.","Every minute of life carries with it its miraculous value, and its face of eternal youth.","A symbol always transcends the one who makes use of it and makes him say in reality more than he is aware of expressing.","If nothing had any meaning, you would be right. But there is something that still has a meaning.","Why should it be essential to love rarely in order to love much?","Retaliation is related to nature and instinct, not to law. Law, by definition, cannot obey the same rules as nature.","Creating is living doubly. The groping, anxious quest of a Proust, his meticulous collecting of flowers, of wallpapers, and of anxieties, signifies nothing else.","At 30 a man should know himself like the palm of his hand, know the exact number of his defects and qualities, know how far he can go, foretell his failures - be what he is. And, above all, accept these things.","Don\'t wait for the last judgment - it takes place every day.","I had only a little time left and I didn\'t want to waste it on God.","To assert in any case that a man must be absolutely cut off from society because he is absolutely evil amounts to saying that society is absolutely good, and no-one in his right mind will believe this today.","Because,\' Cormery went on, \'when I was very young, very foolish, and very much alone ... you paid attention to me and, without seeming to, you opened for me the door to everything I love in the world.","At the age of 40, having ordered meat very rare in restaurants all his life, he realized he actually liked it medium and not at all rare.","Likewise and during every day of an unillustrious life, time carries us. But a moment always comes when we have to carry it.","For if I try to seize this self of which I feel sure, if I try to define and to summarize it, it is nothing but water slipping through my fingers.","We\'re all special cases.","At any street corner the feeling of absurdity can strike any man in the face.","Nihilism is not only despair and negation, but above all the desire to despair and to negate.","To those who despair of everything reason cannot provide a faith, but only passion, and in this case it must be the same passion that lay at the root of the despair, namely humiliation and hatred.","We get into the habit of living before acquiring the habit of thinking. In that race which daily hastens us towards death, the body maintains its irreparable lead.","Je puis nier une chose sans me croire oblig\xe9 de la salir ou de retirer aux autres le droit d\'y croire.","I have no idea what\'s awaiting me, or what will happen when this all ends. For the moment I know this: there are sick people and they need curing.","... We need the sweet pain of anticipation to tell us we are really alive.","If you keep on excusing, you eventually give your blessing to the slave camp, to cowardly force, to organized executioners, to the cynicism of great political monsters; you finally hand over your brothers.","Does the end justify the means? That is possible. But what will justify the end? To that question, which historical thought leaves pending, rebellion replies: the means.","If I convince myself that this life has no other aspect than that of the absurd, if I feel that its whole equilibrium depends on that perpetual opposition between my conscious revolt and the darkness in which it struggles, if I admit that my freedom has no meaning except in relation to its limited fate, then I must say that what counts is not the best living but the most living.","No cause justifies the deaths of innocent people.","Only he who is uncompromising as to his rights maintains the sense of duty.","No longer were there individual destinies; only a collective destiny, made of plague and emotions shared by all.","I know [my label], in any case: a double face, a charming Janus, and underneath, the house motto: \\"Be wary\\". On my business cards:\\"Jean-Baptiste Clamence, actor\\".","In order to be created, a work of art must first make use of the dark forces of the soul","Thus I draw from the absurd three consequences, which are my revolt, my freedom, and my passion. By the mere activity of consciousness I transform into a rule of life what was an invitation to death\u2014and I refuse suicide.","Yes, I know what passion would fill me with all its power. Before, I was too young. I got in the way. Now I know that acting and loving and suffering is living, of course, but it\u2019s only living insofar as you can be transparent and accept your fate, like the unique reflection of a rainbow of joys and passions which is the same for everyone.","They hurt each other without wanting to, just because each represented to the others the cruel and demanding necessity of their lives.","The certainty of a God giving meaning to life far surpasses in attractiveness the ability to behave badly with impunity. The choice would not be hard to make. But there is no choice and that is where the bitterness comes in. The absurd does not liberate; it binds.","Only the sea, murmurous behind the dingy checkerboard of houses, told of the unrest, the precariousness, of all things in this world.","From the evening breeze to this hand on my shoulder, everything has its truth.","I enjoyed my own nature to the fullest, and we all know there lies happiness, although, to soothe one another mutually, we occasionally pretend to condemn such joys as selfishness.","A living man can be enslaved and reduced to the historic condition of an object. But if he dies in refusing to be enslaved, he reaffirms the existence of another kind of human nature which refuses to be classified as an object.","In order to exist, man must rebel, but rebellion must respect the limits that it discovers in itself - limits where minds meet, and in meeting, begin to exist.","A trial cannot be conducted by announcing the general culpability of a civilization. Only the actual deeds which, at least, stank in the nostrils of the entire world were brought to judgment.","I would like to be able to breathe\u2014 to be able to love her by memory or fidelity. But my heart aches. I love you continuously, intensely.","We call first truths those we discover after all the others.","What is a firm hand to me, of what use to me is this astonishing power if I cannot change the order of things, if I cannot make the sun set in the east, that suffering diminish and that beings no longer die?","There is no longer a single idea explaining everything, but an infinite number of essences giving a meaning to an infinite number of objects. The world comes to a stop, but also lights up.","At a certain level of suffering or injustice no one can do anything for anyone. Pain is solitary.","Methods of thought which claim to give the lead to our world in the name of revolution have become, in reality, ideologies of consent and not of rebellion.","What the world requires of the Christians is that they should continue to be Christians.","L\'absurde est la notion essentielle et la premie\' re ve? rite? . The absurd is the fundamental idea and the first truth.","It should be pointed out for our own guidance in the West that the continual signing of manifestoes and protests is one of the surest ways of undermining the efficacy and dignity of the intellectual. There exists a permanent blackmail that we all know and that we must have the often solitary courage to resist.","Time will prolong time, and life will serve life. In this field that is both limited and bulging with possibilities, everything to himself, except his lucidity, seems unforeseeable to him. What rule, then, could emanate from that unreasonable order? The only truth that might seem instructive to him is not formal: it comes to life and unfolds in men. The absurd mind cannot so much expect ethical rules at the end of its reasoning as, rather, illustrations and the breath of human lives.","Happiness and the absurd are two sons of the same earth. They are inseparable.","Revolt and revolution both wind up at the same crossroads: the police, or folly.","There is no fate that cannot be surmounted by scorn.","Your successes and happiness are forgiven you only if you generously consent to share them.","The struggle to the top alone will make a human heart SWELL.","I\'ve never really had much of an imagination. But still I would try to picture the exact moment when the beating of my heart would no longer be going on inside my head.","Man is always prey to his truths. Once he has admitted them, he cannot free himself from them.","But in the end one needs more courage to live than to kill himself.","In order to exist just once in the world, it is necessary never again to exist.","The struggle itself towards the heights is enough to fill a man\'s heart. One must imagine Sisyphus happy.","Mother died today. Or maybe yesterday; I can\'t be sure.","Rebellion cannot exist without a strange form of love.","When a war breaks out, people say: \\"It\'s too stupid; it can\'t last long.\\" But though a war may well be \\"too stupid,\\" that doesn\'t prevent its lasting. Stupidity has a knack of getting its way; as we should see if we were not always so much wrapped up in ourselves.","Man is an idea, and a precious small idea once he turns his back on love.","The myth of unlimited production brings war in its train as inevitably as clouds announce a storm.","It is not rebellion itself which is noble but the demands it makes upon us.","Every revolutionary ends up either by becoming an oppressor or a heretic.","So all a man could win in the conflict between plague and life was knowledge and memories.","\u2026. Query: How contrive not to waste one\'s time? Answer: By being fully aware of it all the while. Ways in which this can be done: By spending one\'s days on an uneasy chair in a dentist\'s waiting-room; by remaining on one\'s balcony all of a Sunday afternoon; by listening to lectures in a language on doesn\'t know; by traveling by the longest and least-convenient train routes, and of course standing all the way; by lining up at the box-office of theaters and then not buying a seat; and so forth.","From the moment absurdity is recognized, it becomes a passion, the most harrowing of all. But whether or not one can live with one\'s passions, whether or not one can accept their law, which is to burn the heart they simultaneously exalt - that is the whole question.","Beauty, no doubt, does not make revolutions. But a day will come when revolutions will have need of beauty.","Every rebellion implies some kind of unity.","I\'ve seen of enough of people who die for an idea. I don\'t believe in heroism; I know it\'s easy and I\'ve learned it can be murderous. What interests me is living and dying for what one loves.","There are some individuals who have too strong a craving, a will, and a nostalgia for happiness ever to reach it. They always retain a bitter and passionate aftertaste, and that\'s the best they can hope for.","The absurd is lucid reason noting its limits.","The human heart has a tiresome tendency to label as fate only what crushes it. But happiness likewise, in its way, is without reason, since it is inevitable.","If there is a soul, it is a mistake to believe that it is given to us fully created. It is created here, throughout a whole life. And living is nothing else but that long and painful bringing forth.","... it is true that I do not respect [human life] more than I respect my own life. And if it is easy for me to kill, that is because it is difficult for me to die.","In our wildest aberrations we dream of an equilibrium we have left behind and which we naively expect to find at the end of our errors. Childish presumption which justifies the fact that child-nations, inheriting our follies, are now directing our history.","Virtue cannot separate itself from reality without becoming a principle of evil.","There is always a philosophy for lack of courage.","One leader, one people, signifies one master and millions of slaves.","Once in the midst of a seemingly endless winter, I discovered within myself an invincible spring.","There is the good and the bad, the great and the low, the just and the unjust. I swear to you that all that will never change.","Between history and the eternal I have chosen history because I like certainties. Of it, at least, I am certain, and how can I deny this force crushing me.","In short, they were gambling on their luck, and luck is not to be coerced.","[Liberty] is a choreand a long-distance race, quite solitary, quite exhausting.","The world is never quiet, even its silence eternally resounds with the same notes, in vibrations which escape our ears. As for those that we perceive, they carry sounds to us, occasionally a chord, never a melody.","Maman used to say that you can always find something to be happy about.","When one has no character, one HAS to apply a method. Here it did wonders incontrovertibly, and I am living on the site of one of the greatest crimes in human history.","A sub-clerk in the post office is the equal of a conqueror if consciousness is common to them. All experiences are indifferent in this regard. There are some that do either a service or a disservice to man. They do him a service if he is conscious. Otherwise, that has no importance: a man\'s failures imply judgment, not of circumstances, but of himself.","The true work of art is always on the human scale. It is essentially the one that says, \'less.","The words that reverberate for us at the confines of this long adventure of rebellion are not formulas for optimism, for which we have no possible use in the extremities of our unhappiness, but words of courage and intelligence which, on the shores of the eternal seas, even have the qualities of virtue.","Everybody knows life isn\'t worth living.","Powerful, yes, that is the word that I constantly rolled on my tongue, I dreamed of absolute power, the kind that forces others tokneel, that forces the enemy to capitulate, finally converting him, and the more the enemy is blind, cruel, sure of himself, buried in his conviction, the more his admission proclaims the royalty of he who has brought on his defeat.","But all the long speeches, all the interminable days and hours that people had spent talking about my soul, had left me with the impression of a colorless swirling river that was making me dizzy.","My profession lent itself nicely to my vocation for heights. It freed me of any bitterness towards my fellow men, who were alwaysin my debt, without my owing them anything. It placed me above the judge whom, I in turn judged, above the defendant whom I forced into gratitude.","And often he who has chosen the fate of the artist because he felt himself to be different soon realizes that he can maintain neither his art nor his difference unless he admits that he is like the others. The artist forges himself to the others, midway between the beauty he cannot do without and the community he cannot tear himself away from.","Absolute justice is achieved by the suppression of all contradiction, therefore it destroys freedom.","There is a metaphysical honour in ending the world\'s absurdity. Conquest or play-acting, multiple loves, absurd revolt are tributes that man pays to his dignity in a campaign in which he is defeated in advance.... War cannot be negated. One must live it or die of it. So it is with the absurd: it is a question of breathing with it, of recognizing its lessons and recovering their flesh. In this regard the absurd joy par excellence is creation. \\"Art and nothing but art\\", said Nietzsche, \\"we have art in order not to die of the truth.\\"","Even when one sits in the prisoner\'s dock, it is interesting to hear talk about oneself.","If one could only say just once: \'this is clear\', all would be saved","And indeed it could be said that once the faintest stirring of hope became possible, the dominion of plague was ended.","Again and again there comes a time in history when the man who dares to say that two and two make four is punished with death. (\\"The Plague\\")","When the body is sad, the heart languishes.","The important thing isn\'t the soundness or otherwise of the argument, but for it to make you think.","As for Hitler, his professed religion unhesitatingly juxtaposed the God-Providence and Valhalla. Actually his god was an argument at a political meeting and a manner of reaching an impressive climax at the end of speeches.","There are more things to admire in men than to despise.","[Many artists], even the greatest ones, are not sure of their own existence. So they search for proof, they judge, they condemn. It strengthens them, it is the beginnings of existence. They are alone!","I do not want to found anything on the incomprehensible. I want to know whether I can live with what I know and with that alone.","One must place one\'s principles in big things. For the small, graciousness will suffice.","It is easier to kill what we do not know.","For ever, I shall be a stranger to myself.","Then we understand that rebellion cannot exist without a strange form of love. Those who find no rest in God or in history are condemned to live for those who, like themselves, cannot live; in fact, for the humiliated.","There is not a single true work of art that has not in the end added to the inner freedom insight and life of each person who has known and loved it.","They knew now that if there is one thing one can always yearn for, and sometimes attain, it is human love.","I have no friends, I only have accomplices now. On the other hand, my accomplices are more numerous than my friends: they are the human race.","I should like to be able to love my country and still love justice.","Sometimes, from beyond the skycrapers, the cry of a tugboat finds you in your insomnia, and you remember that this desert of iron and cement is an island.","It is not true that the heart wears out - but the body creates this illusion.","Chacun exige d\'e\\"  tre innocent, a\'   tout prix, me\\"  me si, pour cela, il faut accuser le genre humain et le ciel. Everyone insists on his or her innocence, at all costs, even if it means accusing the rest of the human race and heaven.","We are not certain, we are never certain. If we were we could reach some conclusions, and we could, at last, make others take us seriously.","But when a man has had only four hours\' sleep he isn\'t sentimental. He sees things as they are: that is to say, he sees them in the garish light of justice; hideous, witless justice.","The ancients, even though they believed in destiny , believed primarily in nature , in which they participated wholeheartedly. To rebel against nature amounted to rebelling against oneself. It was butting one\'s head against a wall.","In the next few years the struggle will not be between utopia and reality, but between different utopias, each trying to impose itself on reality ... we can no longer hope to save everything, but ... we can at least try to save lives, so that some kind of future, if perhaps not the ideal one, will remain possible.","Friendship is not so simple. It is hard to get and takes a long time, but when one ha it one cannot get rid of it, one has to face it.","I lived with the only continuity, day to day, of the me-me-me.","The mistake that men make is that they do not believe in theater. Otherwise, they would know that every man is allowed to play thecelestial tragedies and to become god. All he has to do is harden his heart.","The real passion of the twentieth century is servitude.","I used to advertise my loyalty and I don\'t believe there is a single person I loved that I didn\'t eventually betray.","The main thing is that everything become simple, easy enough for a child to understand.","A novel is never anything but a philosophy expressed in images. And in a good novel the philosophy has disappeared into the images.","We are condemned to live together.","But the world itself has no reason, and I can say so, I who have experienced it all, from the creation to the destruction.","There will be no lasting peace either in the heart of individuals or in social customs until death is outlawed.","Truth, like light is dazzling. By contrast, untruth is a beautiful sunset that enhances everything.","There was the same dazzling red glare. The sea gasped for air with each shallow, stifled wave that broke on the sand. ...with every blade of light that flashed off the sand, from a bleached shell or a peice of broken glass, my jaws tightened. I walked for a long time.","This divorce between man and his life, the actor and his setting, is properly the feeling of absurdity.","It is normal to give away a little of one\'s life in order not to lose it all.","God is not necessary to create culpability, or to punish. Our fellow men are enough for that, helped by ourselves.","We don\'t have the time to completely be ourselves. We only have the room to be happy.","When love ceases to be tragic it is something else and the individual again throws himself in search of tragedy.","And I too, felt ready to start life all over again. It was as if that great rush of anger had washed me clean, emptied me of hope, and, gazing up at the dark sky spangled with its signs and stars, for the first time, the first, I laid my heart open to the benign indifference of the universe.","Happiness is not everything and men have their duties. Mine is to find my mother, a homeland","Thus I progressed on the surface of life, in the realm of words as it were, never in reality. All those books barely read, those friends barely loved, those cities barely visited, those women barely possessed! I went through the gestures out of boredom or absent-mindedness. Then came human beings; they wanted to cling, but there was nothing to cling to, and that was unfortunate--for them. As for me, I forgot. I never remembered anything but myself.","Many fledgling moralists in those days were going about our town proclaiming there was nothing to be done about it and we should bow to the inevitable. And Tarrou, Rieux, and their friends might give one answer or another, but its conclusion was always the same, their certitude that a fight must be put up, in this way or that, and there must be no bowing down... There was nothing admirable about this attitude; it was merely logical.","O light! This the cry of all the characters of ancient drama brought face to face with their fate. This last resort was ours, too, and I knew it now. In the middle of winter I at last discovered that there was in me an invincible summer.","The reasoning is classic in its clarity. If God does not exist, Kirilov is god. If God does not exist, Kirilov must kill himself. Kirilov must therefore kill himself to become god. That logic is absurd, but it is what is needed.","A man who has become conscious of the absurd is for ever bound to it.","Have pity, Lord, on those who love and are separated.","You know, [women] do not really condemn any weakness: rather, they try to humiliate or disarm our strengths. That is why women arethe reward, not of the warrior, but of the criminal.","Yes, I\'m happy, in human terms.","Generally, I like all islands. There, it is easier to rule.","the one who doesnt play, doesnt win anything, but he actually looses somehting, {playing}","A single sentence will suffice for modern man. He fornicated and read the papers. After that vigorous definition, the subject will be, if I may say so, exhausted.","Do you believe in God, doctor?\\" No - but what does that really mean? I\'m fumbling in the dark, struggling to make something out. But I\'ve long ceased finding that original.","Ah! my friend, for whomever is alone, without a god and without a master, the weight of time is terrible. One must then choose a master, God being out of style.","To correct a natural indifference I was placed half-way between misery and the sun. Misery kept me from believing that all was well under the sun, and the sun taught me that history wasn\'t everything.","In Italian museums are sometimes found little painted screens that the priest used to hold in front of the face of condemned men to hide the scaffold from them.","Liberty is dangerous.","The harshest winter finds an invincible summer in us.","The entire history of mankind is, in any case, nothing but a prolonged fight to the death for the conquest of universal prestige and absolute power.","Cruel irony, the poor man tormented with hunger feeds those who plead his case.","I realized people would soon forget me once I was dead. I couldn\'t even say that this was hard to stomach; really, there\'s no idea to which one doesn\'t get acclimatized in time.","Men are never really willing to die except for the sake of freedom: therefore they do not believe in dying completely.","Have you noticed that only death arouses our emotions? How we love thee friends who have just passed away, right? How we admire those master who no longer speak, their mouths full of dirt. We them we are not obligated.","True artists scorn nothing.","In normal times all of us know, whether consciously or not, that there is no love which can\'t be bettered; nevertheless, we reconcile ourselves more or less easily to the fact that ours has never risen above the average.","It is terrifying to see how easily, in certain people, all dignity collapses. Yet when you think about it, this is quite normal since they only maintain this dignity by constantly striving against their own nature.","I felt the urge to reassure him that I was like everybody else, just like everybody else.","Nothing can discourage the appetite for divinity in the heart of man.","To begin with, poor people\xb4s memory is less nourished than that of a rich; it has fewer landmarks in space because they seldom leave the place where they live, and fewer reference points in time throughtout lives that are grey and featureless.","One of the only coherent philosophical positions is thus revolt. It is a constant confrontation between man and his own obscurity.","The day of my arrest I was first put in a room where there were already several other prisoners, most of them Arabs. They laughed when they saw me. Then they asked what I was in for. I said I\'d killed an Arab and they were all silent","Empires and churches are born under the sun of death.","Nature is a burning and frigid, transparent and limited universe in which nothing is possible but everything is given.","Don\'t lies eventually lead to the truth? And don\'t all my stories, true or false, tend toward the same conclusion? Don\'t they all have the same meaning? So what does it matter whether they are true or false if, in both cases, they are significant of what I have been and what I am? Sometimes it is easier to see clearly into the liar than into the man who tells the truth. Truth, like light, blinds. Falsehood, on the contrary, is a beautiful twilight that enhances every object.","Give up the tyranny of female charm.","Freedom is the right to never have to lie.","Because there is nothing here than invites us to cherish unhappy lovers. Nothing is more vain than to die for love. What we ought to do is live.","I have always felt I lived on the high seas, threatened, at the heart of a royal happiness.","Every man needs slaves like he needs clean air. To rule is to breathe, is it not? And even the most disenfranchised get to breathe. The lowest on the social scale have their spouses or their children.","Crime too is a form of solitude, even if one thousand get together to commit it. And it is right for me to die alone, after having lived and killed alone.","There may be responsible persons, but there are no guilty ones.","But,\' I reminded myself, \'it\'s common knowledge that life isn\'t worth living, anyhow.","What really counted was the possibility of escape, a leap to freedom, out of the implacable ritual, a wild run for it that would give whatever chance for hope there was. Of course, hope meant being cut down on some street corner, as you ran like mad, by a random bullet. But when I really thought it through, nothing was going to allow me such a luxury. Everything was against it; I would just be caught up in the machinery again.","We are rebels for a cause, poets with a dream , and we won\'t let this world die without a fight.","I would rather not have upset him, but I couldn\'t see any reason to change my life. Looking back on it, I wasn\'t unhappy. When I was a student, I had lots of ambitions like that. But when I had to give up my studies I learned very quickly that none of it really mattered.","A craving for freedom and independence is generated only in a man still living on hope.","I had the whole sky in my eyes and it was blue and gold.","There are means that cannot be excused. And I should like to be able to love my country and still love justice. I don\'t want just any greatness for it, particularly a greatness born of blood and falsehood. I want to keep it alive by keeping justice alive.","Having money is a way of being free of money.","The principles which men give to themselves end by overwhelming their noblest intentions.","Since we\'re all going to die, it\'s obvious that when and how don\'t matter.","The truth, as the light, makes blind.","The struggle to reach the top is itself enough to fulfill the heart of man. One must believe that Sisyphus is happy.","All systems of morality are based on the idea that an action has consequences that legitimize or cancel it. A mind imbued with the absurd merely judges that those consequences must be considered calmly.","Great ideas come into the world as gently as doves.","In that night alive with signs and stars, I opened myself to the gentle indifference of the world.  Finding it so much like myself--like a brother, really--I felt that I had been happy and that I was happy again.","There is a terrible emptiness in me, an indifference that hurts.","Accept life, take it as it is? Stupid. The means of doing otherwise? Far from our having to take it, it is life that possesses us and on occasion shuts our mouths.","But do you know why we are always more just and generous toward the dead? The reason is simple. With them there is no obligation. They leave us free and we can take our time, fit the testimonial between a cocktail party and a nice little mistress, in our spare time, in short.","This is the century of fear.","Maman died today. Or yesterday maybe, I don\'t know. I got a telegram from the home: \'Mother deceased. Funeral tomorrow. Faithfully yours.\' That doesn\'t mean anything. Maybe it was yesterday.","If Christianity is pessimistic as to man, it is optimistic as to human destiny. Well, I can say that, pessimistic as to human destiny, I am optimistic as to man.","How do you put everyone in the pool, so you have the right to dry yourself in the sun?","Revolution, in order to be creative, cannot do without either a moral or metaphysical rule to balance the insanity of history.","We come into the world laden with the weight of an infinite necessity.","... habit starts at the second crime. At the first one, something is ending.","You cannot acquire experience by making experiments. You cannot create experience. You must undergo it.","Mistakes are joyful, truth infernal.","Paneloux is a man of learning, a scholar. He hasn\'t come in contact with death; that\'s why he can speak with such assurance of the truth-with a capital T. But every country priest who visits his parishioners and has heard a man gasping for breath on his deathbed thinks as I do. He\'d try to relieve human suffering before trying to point out its goodness.","Am well. Thinking of you always. Love","I am alive again, now that I can no longer stand to live.","I was comfortable in all, I admit, but at the same time, nothing satisfied me. Each joy made me seek another.","That must be wonderful; I have no idea of what it means.","Here lives a free man. Nobody serves him.","There are always reasons for murdering a man. But there is no justification for his existence.","You know very well that I no longer think. I am far too intelligent for that.","What is called a reason for living is also an excellent reason for dying.","This very heart which is mine will forever remain indefinable to me. Between the certainty I have of my existence and the content I try to give to that assurance, the gap will never be filled. Forever I shall be a stranger to myself.","Life is the result of all your choices.","\u201cTo think the way you do,\u201d he said smiling, \u201cyou have to be a man who lives either on a tremendous despair, or on a tremendous hope.\u201d \u201cOn both, perhaps.\u201d","I realized then that a man who had lived only one day could easily live for a hundred years in prison. He would have enough memories to keep him from being bored","Men cry because things are not what they ought to be.","Art, at least, teaches us that man cannot be explained by history alone and that he also finds a reason for his existence in the order of nature.","...the play of the toughest and most lucid mind are at the same time both lavished andsquandered.","The more I accuse myself, the more right I have to judge you. Even better, I make you judge yourself, which comforts me the more.","Their guilt made me eloquent because I was not its victim.","These are facts the heart can feel; yet they call for careful study before they become clear to the intellect.","The world expects of Christians that they will raise their voices so loudly and clearly and so formulate their protest that not even the simplest man can have the slightest doubt about what they are saying. Further, the world expects of Christians that they will eschew all fuzzy abstractions and plant themselves squarely in front of the bloody face of history. We stand in need of folk who have determined to speak directly and unmistakably and come what may, to stand by what they have said.","On the whole, men are more good than bad; that, however, isn\'t the real point. But they are more or less ignorant, and it is this that we call vice or virtue; the most incorrigible vice being that of an ignorance that fancies it knows everything and therefore claims for itself the right to kill. The soul of the murderer is blind; and there can be no true goodness nor true love without the utmost clear-sightedness.","Nothing in the world is worth turning one\'s back on what one loves.","To insure the adoration of a theorem for any length of time, faith is not enough, a police force is needed as well.","Conscious of not being able to separate myself from my time, I have decided to become part of it.","... there are two types of happiness and I have chosen that of the murderers. For I am happy. There was a time when I thought I had reached the limit of distress. Beyond that limit, there is a sterile and magnificent happiness.","Each generation doubtless feels called upon to reform the world. Mine knows that it will not reform it, but its task is perhaps even greater. It consists in preventing the world from destroying itself.","I have the loftiest idea, and the most passionate one, of art. Much too lofty to agree to subject it to anything. Much too passionate to want to divorce it from anything.","None of the evils which totalitarianism ... claims to remedy is worse than totalitarianism itself.","Men are convinced of your arguments, your sincerity, and the seriousness of your efforts only by your death.","Ironic philosophies produce passionate works.","what doesn\'t kill you make you stronger and stronger","Rebellion cannot exist without the feeling that somewhere, in some way, you are justified.","Every ideology is contrary to human psychology.","Men who have greatness within them don\'t go in for politics.","Travel, which is like a greater and a graver science, brings us back to ourselves.","What I believe to be true I must therefore preserve. What seems to me so obvious, even against me, I must support.","Myths are made for the imagination to breath life into them.","Thus, I always began by assuming the worst; my appeal was dismissed. That meant, of course, I was to die. Sooner than others, obviously. \'But,\' I reminded myself, \'it\'s common knowledge that life isn\'t worth living, anyhow.\' And, on a wide view, I could see that it makes little difference whether one dies at the age of thirty or threescore and ten-- since, in either case, other men will continue living, the world will go on as before. Also, whether I died now or forty years hence, this business of dying had to be got through, inevitably.","Your success and happiness are forgiven you only if you generously consent to share them. But to be happy it is essential not to be too concerned with others. Consequently, there is no escape. Happy and judged, or absolved and wretched.","I understood, by dint of digging into my memories, that modesty helped me to shine, humility helped me to triumph and virtue to oppress.","It is natural to give a clear view of the world after accepting the idea that it must be clear.","Holland is a dream, Monsieur, a dream of gold and smoke-smokier by day, more gilded by night. And night and day that dream is peopled with Lohengrins like these, dreamily riding their black bicycles with high handle-bars, funereal swans constantly drifting throughout the whole country, around the seas, along the canals.","One grows out of pity when it\'s useless.","The world I live in is loathsome to me, but I feel one with the men who suffer in it","The only conception of freedom I can have is that of the prisoner or the individual in the midst of the State. The only one I know is freedom of thought and action.","Il y a dans les hommes plus de choses a\'   admirer que de choses a\'   me  priser. There are more things to admire in people than to despise.","What, then, is that incalculable feeling that deprives the mind of the sleep necessary to life? A world that can be explained even with bad reasons is a familiar world. But, on the other hand, in a universe suddenly divested of illusions and lights, man feels an alien, a stranger. His exile is without remedy since he is deprived of the memory of a lost home or the hope of a promised land. This divorce between man and his life, the actor and his setting, is properly the feeling of absurdity.","Man wants to live, but it is useless to hope that this desire will dictate all his actions.","What made me run away was doubtless not so much the fear of settling down, but of settling down permanently in something ugly.","And so I learned that familiar paths traced in the dusk of summer evenings may lead as well to prison as to innocent untroubled sleep.","What\'s natural is the microbe. All the rest-heath, integrity, purity (if you like)-is a product of the human will, of a vigilance that must never falter. The good man, the man who infects hardly anyone, is the man who has the fewest lapses of attention.","If the only significant history of human thought were to be written, it would have to be the history of its successive regrets and its impotences.","When the throne of God is overturned, the rebel realizes that it is now his own responsibility to create the justice, order, and unity that he sought in vain within his own condition, and in this way to justify the fall of God. Then begins the desperate effort to create, at the price of crime and murder if necessary, the dominion of man.","History, as an entirety, could only exist in the eyes of an observer outside it and outside the world. History only exists, in the final analysis, for God.","The temptation shared by all forms of intelligence: cynicism.","And for all his life it would be kindness and love that made him cry, never pain or persecution, which on the contrary only reinforced his spirit and his resolution.","There can be no question of holding forth on ethics. I have seen people behave badly with great morality and I note every day that integrity has no need of rules","In the light, the earth remains our first and our last love. Our brothers are breathing under the same sky as we; justice is a living thing. Now is born that strange joy which helps one live and die, and which we shall never again postpone to a later time.","Our civilization survives in the complacency of cowardly or malignant minds -- a sacrifice to the vanity of aging adolescents","but perhaps we should love what we cannot understand","All that remains is a fate whose outcome alone is fatal. Outside of that single fatality of death, everything, joy or happiness, is liberty. A world remains of which man is the sole master. What bound him was the illusion of another world. The outcome of his thought, ceasing to be renunciatory, flowers in images. It frolics-\\\\-\\\\-in myths, to be sure, but myths with no other depth than that of human suffering and, like it, inexhaustible. Not the divine fable that amuses and blinds, but the terrestrial face, gesture, and drama in which are summed up a difficult wisdom and an ephemeral passion.","I hope the dogs don\'t bark tonight. I always think it\'s mine","The current motto for all of us can only be this: without giving up anything on the plane of justice, yield nothing on the plane of freedom.","I don\'t want to represent man as he is, but only as he might be.","He seemed so certain about everything, didn\'t he?  And yet none of his certainties was worth one hair of a woman\'s head.  He wasn\'t even sure he was alive, because he was living like a dead man.","The mind\'s deepest desire, even in its most elaborate operations, parallels man\'s unconscious feeling in the face of his universe: it is an insistence upon familiarity, an appetite for clarity.","We continue to shape our personality all our life. If we knew ourselves perfectly, we should die.","Tout re  volutionnaire finit en oppresseur ou en he  re  tique. Every revolutionary ends as an oppressor or a heretic.","No, Father, I\'ve a very different idea of love. And until my dying day I shall refuse to love a scheme of things in which children are put to torture.","Utopia is that which is in contradiction with reality.","A writer cannot put himself today in service of those who make history; he is at the service of those who suffer it.","Beginning to think is beginning to be undermined. Society has but little connection with such beginnings. The worm is in man\'s heart. That is where it must be sought. One must follow and understand this fatal game that leads from lucidity in the face of existence to flight from light.","The rebel can never find peace. He knows what is good and, despite himself, does evil. The value which supports him is never given to him once and for all - he must fight to uphold it, unceasingly.","The first progressive step for a mind overwhelmed by the strangeness of things is to realize that this feeling of strangeness is shared with all men and that human reality, in its entirety, suffers from the distance which separates it from the rest of the universe.","Happiness and the absurd are two sons of the same earth. They are inseparable. It would be a mistake to say that happiness necessarily springs from the absurd discovery. It happens as well that the felling of the absurd springs from happiness. \\"I conclude that all is well,\\" says Oedipus, and that remark is sacred. It echoes in the wild and limited universe of man. It teaches that all is not, has not been, exhausted. It drives out of this world a god who had come into it with dissatisfaction and a preference for futile suffering. It makes of fate a human matter, which must be settled among men.","We must stitch up what has been torn apart, render justice imaginable in the world which is so obviously unjust, make happiness meaningful for nations poisoned by the misery of this century. Naturally, it is a superhuman task. But tasks are called superhuman when men take a long time to complete them, that is all.","If Nietzsche is correct, that to shame a man is to kill him, then any honest attempt at autobiography will be an act of self-destruction.","A liking for truth at any cost is a passion that spares nothing and that nothing resists. It\'s a vice, at times a comfort, or a selfishness.","Still, obviously, one can\'t be sensible all the time.","I conceived at least one great love in my life, of which I was always the object.","It happens that the stage sets collapse. Rising, streetcar, four hours in the office or the factory, meal, streetcar, four hours of work, meal, sleep, and Monday Tuesday Wednesday Thursday Friday and Saturday according to the same rhythm \u2013 this path is easily followed most of the time. But one day the \u201cwhy\u201d arises and everything begins in that weariness tinged with amazement.","Fate is not in man but around him","Every man, and for stronger reasons, every artist, wants to be recognized. So do I.","And real nobility (that of the heart) is based on scorn, courage, and profound indifference.","What will be left of the power of example if it is proved that capital punishment has another power, and a very real one, which degrades men to the point of shame, madness, and murder?","Germany collapsed as a result of having engaged in a struggle for empire with the concepts of provincial politics.","The absurd is essentially a divorce. It lies in neither of the elements compared; it is born of their confrontation.","Absurd- that is the light mind that  establishes its own borders.","I was born poor and without religion, under a happy sky, feeling harmony, not hostility, in nature. I began not by feeling torn, but in plenitude.","The laws of nature may be operative up to a certain limit, beyond which they turn against themselves to give birth to the absurd.","All modern revolutions have ended in a reinforcement of the power of the State.","The future is the only kind of property that the masters willingly concede to the slaves.","Men die and they are not happy.","My great idea is that we must forgive the Pope. First of all, he needs it more than anyone else. Besides, it is the only way of placing oneself above him.","On good days, if you trust life, life has to answer you.","The spirit of rebellion can only exist in a society where a theoretical equality conceals great factual inequalities. The problem of rebellion, therefore, has no meaning except within our own Western society.","By giving too much importance to fine actions one may end by paying an indirect but powerful tribute to evil, because in so doing one implies that such fine actions are only valuable because they are rare, and that malice or indifference are far more common motives in the actions of men.","In a universe suddenly divested of illusion and lights, man feels an alien, a stranger. His exile is without remedy since he is deprived of the memory of a lost home or the hope of a promised land.","In Holland, everyone is an expert in painting and in tulips.","There is but one freedom, To put oneself right with death. After that everything is possible. I cannot force you to believe in God. Believing in God amounts to coming to terms with death. When you have accepted death, the problem of God will be solved, and not the reverse.","The most eloquent eulogy of capitalism was made by its greatest enemy. Marx is only anti-capitalist in so far as capitalism is out of date.","Politics and the fate of mankind are formed by men without ideals and without greatness.  Those who have greatness within them do not go in for politics.","What must be remembered in any case is that secret complicity that joins the logical and the everyday to the tragic.","Some cry: \'Love me!!\' Others: \'Don\'t love me!!\' But a certain genus, the worst and most unhappy, cries: \'Don\'t love me and be faithful to me!!\'","Betrayal answers betrayal, the mask of love is answered by the disappearance of love.","I have not stopped loving that which is sacred in this world.","Can one be a saint if God does not exist? That is the only concrete problem I know of today.","Whereas the Greeks gave to will the boundaries of reason, we have come to put the will\'s impulse in the very center of reason, which has, as a result, become deadly.","From Paul to Stalin, the popes who have chosen Caesar have prepared the way for Caesars who quickly learn to despise popes.","What, in fact, is a novel but a universe in which action is endowed with form, where final words are pronounced, where people possess one another completely, and where life assumes the aspect of destiny?","Great feelings take with them their own universe, splendid or abject. They light up with their passion an exclusive world in which they recognize their climate.","Everything is true, and nothing is true!","It was previously a question of finding out whether or not life had to have a meaning to be lived. It now becomes clear on the contrary that it will be lived all the better if it has no meaning","Slave camps under the flag of freedom, massacres justified by philanthropy or the taste of the superhuman, cripple judgment. On the day when crime puts on the apparel of innocence, through a curious reversal peculiar to our age, it is innocence that is called on to justify itself. The purpose of this essay is to accept and study that strange challenge.","There are places where the mind dies so that a truth which is its very denial may be born.","Real fulfillment, for the man who allows absolutely free rein to his desires, and who much dominate everything, lies in hatred.","Metaphysical rebellion is a claim, motivated by the concept of a complete unity, against the suffering of life and death and a protest against the human condition both for its incompleteness, thanks to death, and its wastefulness, thanks to evil.","The contradiction is this: man rejects the world as it is, without accepting the necessity of escaping it. In fact, men cling to the world and by far the majority do not want to abandon it.","The absurd is sin without God.","Realism should only be the means of expression of religious genius... or, at the other extreme, the artistic expressions of monkeys which are quite satisfied with mere imitation. In fact, art is never realistic though sometimes it is tempted to be. To be really realistic a description would have to be endless.","God put self-pity by the side of despair like the cure by the side of the disease.","It occurred to me that anyway one more Sunday was over that Maman was buried now, that I was going back to work, and that, really, nothing had changed.","A r\xe9gime [Nazism] which invented a biological foreign policy was obviously acting against its own best interests. But at least it obeyed its own particular logic.","This absurd, godless world is, then, peopled with men who think clearly and have ceased to hope. And I have not yet spoken of the most absurd character, who is the creator.","The primordial sea indefatigably repeats the same words and casts up the same astonished beings on the same sea-shore.","No human being, even the most passionately loved and passionately loving, is ever in our possession.","The kingdom of heaven will, in fact, appear on earth , but it will be ruled over by men a mere handful to begin with, who will be the Cassars, because they were the first to understand and later, with time, by all men.","In truth, I was so good at being a man, with such plenitude and simplicity, that I thought I was something of a superman.","I feel more fellowship with the defeated than with saints.","how hard it must be to live only with what one knows and what one remembers, cut off from what one hopes for!","The revolutionary government was required to become the government of the war.","I continue to believe that this world has no ultimate meaning. But I know that something in it has a meaning and that is man, because he is the only creature to insist on having one","For who would dare to assert that eternal happiness can compensate for a single moment\'s human suffering","False judges are held up in the world\'s admiration and I alone know the true ones.","Existence is illusory and it is eternal.","Those who love, friends and lovers, know that love is not only a blinding flash, but also a long and painful struggle in the darkness for the realization of definitive recognition and reconciliation.","life is a story and god is author.life is absurd.I think so.","The absurd is a shadow cast over everything we do and even if we try to live life as if it has meaning as if there are reasons for doing things the absurd will linger in the back of our minds as a nagging doubt that perhaps there is no point.","You will always win if you make an effort, no matter how much. However, if you failed it means you were too lazy.","Suffering gives us no special rights.","Since the order of the world is shaped by death, mightn\'t it be better for God if we refuse to believe in Him, and struggle with all our might against death without raising our eyes towards the heaven where He sits in silence?","The Byronic hero, incapable of love, or capable only of an impossible love, suffers endlessly. He is solitary, languid, his condition exhausts him. If he wants to feel alive, it must be in the terrible exaltation of a brief and destructive action.","His own faith, however, was not lacking in virtues since it consisted in acknowledging obscurely that he would be granted much without ever deserving anything.","The workman of today works every day in his life at the same tasks, and this fate is no less absurd. But it is tragic only at the rare moments when it becomes conscious.","After a short silence the doctor raised himself a little in his chair and asked if Tarrou had an idea of the path to follow for attaining peace. \\"Yes, he replied. \\"The path of sympathy.","Thus each of us had to be content to live only for the day, alone under the vast indifference of the sky.","Our reason has driven all away. Alone at last, we end up ruling over a desert.","The truth is that nothing is less sensational than pestilence, and by reason of their very duration great misfortunes are monotonous.","No doubt our love was still there, but quite simply it was unusable, heavy to carry, inert inside of us, sterile as crime or condemnation. It was no longer anything except a patience with no future and a stubborn wait.","Psychology is action, not thinking about oneself. We continue to shape our personality all our life. To know oneself, one should assert oneself.","May heaven protect us, cher monsieur, from being set on a pedestal by our friends!!!","Just as all thought, and primarily that of non-signification, signifies something, so there is no art that has no signification.","I do not want to believe that death is the gateway to another life. For me, it is a closed door. I do not say it is a step we must all take, but that it is a horrible and dirty adventure.","Over there, in Europe, all was shame and anger. Here it was exile or solitude, among these languid and agitated madmen who danced in order to die.","The end of their passion consists of loving uselessly at the moment when it is pointless.","At times I feel myself overtaken by an immense tenderness for these people around me who live in the same century.","La ve  rite  , comme la lumie\'  re, aveugle. Le mensonge, au contraire, est un beau cre  puscule qui met chaque objet en valeur. Truth, like light, blinds. A lie, on the contrary, is a beautiful twilight which shows the value of each object.","Without work all life goes rotten.","But again and again there comes a time in history when the man who dares to say that two and two make four is punished with death. The schoolteacher is well aware of this. And the question is not one of knowing what punishment or reward attends the making of this calculation. The question is one of knowing whether two and two do make four","For me, physical love has always been bound to an irresistible feeling of innocence and joy. Thus, I cannot love in tears but in exaltation.","So the thing that bothered me most was that the condemned man had to hope the machine would work the first time.","In the past, the poverty they shared had a certain sweetness about it. When the end of the day came and they would eat their dinner in silence with the oil lamp between them, there was a secret joy in such simplicity, such retrenchment.","All that remains is a fate whose outcome alone is fatal. Outside of that single fatality of death, everything, joy or happiness, is liberty. A world remains of which man is the sole master. What bound him was the illusion of another world.","Ce que je sais de la morale, c\'est au football que je le dois. (I know of morality, it is football that I owe.)","What gives value to travel is fear.  It is a fact that, at a certain moment, when we are so far from our own country, we are seized by a vague fear and an instinctive desire to go back to the protection of old habits.  I look upon it more as an occasion for testing.","A stranger to myself and to the world, armed solely with a thought that negates itself as soon as it asserts, what is this condition in which I can have peace only by refusing to know and to live, in which the appetite for conquest bumps into walls that defy its assaults?","I was absent at the moment I took up the most space.","What the world expects of Christians is that Christians should speak out, loud and clear... in such a way that never a doubt, never the slightest doubt, could rise in the heart of the simplest man.","People have played on words and pretended to believe that refusing to grant a meaning to life necessarily leads to declaring that it is not worth living. In truth, there is no necessary common measure between these two judgments.","Maman used to say that you can always find something to be happy about. In my prison, when the sky turned red and a new day slipped into my cell, I found out that she was right.","Gilbert Jonas, painter, believed in his star.... His own faith was not, however, without its virtues because it consisted in admitting, in some obscure way, that he would obtain many things without deserving them.","In the world today, only a philosophy of eternity could justify non-violence.","...

It progresses from appearances to acts, from the dandy to the revolutionary.","Independence is earned by a few words of cheap confidence","To be famous, in fact, one has only to kill one\'s landlady.","At that moment he knew what his mother was thinking, and that she loved him. But he knew, too, that to love someone means relatively little; or, rather, that love is never strong enough to find the words befitting it. Thus he and his mother would always love each other silently. And one day she--or he--would die, without ever, all their lives long, having gone farther than this by way of making their affection known.","In default of inexhaustible happiness, eternal suffering would at least give us a destiny. But we do not even have that consolation, and our worst agonies come to an end one day.","Where would his torture be, indeed, if at every step the hope of succeeding upheld him?","The only way out [of international dictatorship] is to place international law above governments, which means [...] that there must be a parliament for making it, and that parliament must be constituted by means of worldwide elections in which all nations will take part.","In our society, any man who doesn\'t cry at his mother\'s funeral is liable to be condemned to death.","It is better for the intellectual not to talk all the time. To begin with, it would exhaust him, and, above all, it would keep him from thinking.

But better does not mean different, it means unified... Religion or crime, every human endeavor in fact, finally obeys this unreasonabledesire and claims to give life a form it does not have.","Likewise, every time somebody interjects to speak of my honesty there is someone who quivers inside me.","I like these people swarming on the sidewalks, wedged into a little space of houses and canals, hemmed in by fogs, cold lands, and the sea streaming like a wet wash.

The old boy\u2019s face, for instance, when he caught up with us for the last time, just outside the village. His eyes were streaming with tears, of exhaustion or distress, or both together. But because of the wrinkles they couldn\u2019t flow down.

He has two faces: he can\'t love without self-love.","Believe me, for certain men at least, not taking what one doesn\'t desire is the hardest thing in the world.","Finally, and most of all, words failed him.","The only deep emotion I occasionally felt in these affairs was gratitude, when all was going well and I was left, not only peace, but freedom to come and go--never kinder and gayer with one woman than when I had just left another\'s bed, as if I extended to all others the debt I had just contracted toward one of them.","Human relationships always help us to carry on because they always presuppose a future.","I hadn\'t understood how days could be both long and short at the same time: long to live through, maybe, but so drawn out that they ended up flowing into one another. They lost their names. Only \'yesterday\' and \'tomorrow\' still had any meaning for me.","What on earth prompted you to take a hand in this?\\" \\"I don\'t know.

But really there wasn\'t much point, and I gave up the idea out of laziness.","To cut short this question of the law of retaliation, we must note that even in its primitive form it can operate only between two individuals of whom one is absolutely innocent and the other absolutely guilty. The victim, to be sure, is innocent. But can the society that is supposed to represent the victim lay claim to innocence?","... here, where the gaze is stopped everywhere, the whole earth is designed so that the face turns upward and the gaze implores. Oh! I hate this world where we are reduced to God.","To live is to hurt others, and through others, to hurt oneself. Cruel earth! How can we manage not to touch anything? To find what ultimate exile?","Lucifer also has died with God, and from his ashes has arisen a spiteful demon who does not even understand the object of his venture.","I had been right I was still right I was always right. I had lived my life one way and I could just as well lived it another. I had done this and I hadn t done that. I hadn t done this thing and I had done another.

As it is not so easy as the detective novels might lead one to believe, one generally relies on politics and joins the cruelest party.What does it matter, after all, if by humiliating one\'s mind one succeeds in dominating every one? I discovered in myself sweet dreams of oppression.","I longed to be forgotten in order to be able to complain to myself.","To stay or to go, it amounted to the same thing.","In every rebellion is to be found the metaphysical demand for unity, the impossibility of capturing it, and the construction of a substitute universe.","What did it matter if he existed for two or for twenty years? Happiness was the fact that he had existed.","In fact, it comes to this: nobody is capable of really thinking about anyone, even in the worst calamity. For really to think about someone means thinking about that person every minute of the day, without letting one\u2019s thoughts be diverted by anything- by meals, by a fly that settles on one\u2019s cheek, by household duties, or by a sudden itch somewhere. But there are always flies and itches.

I felt as if I understood why at the end of her life she had taken a \'fianc\xe9,\' why she had played at beginning again. Even there, in that home where lives were fading out, evening was a kind of wistful respite. So close to death, Maman must have felt free then and ready to live it all again. Nobody, nobody had the right to cry over her. And I felt ready to live it all again too.","The principle can be established that for a man who does not cheat what he believes to be true must determine his actions.","I explained to him, however, that my nature was such that my physical needs often got in the way of my feelings.","To write is to become disinterested.

For all to be accomplished, for me to feel less lonely, all that remained to hope was that on the day of my execution there should be a huge crowd of spectators and that they should greet me with howls of execration.","Find meaning. Distinguish melancholy from sadness. Go out for a walk. It doesn\u2019t have to be a romantic walk in the park, spring at its most spectacular moment, flowers and smells and outstanding poetical imagery smoothly transferring you into another world. It doesn\u2019t have to be a walk during which you\u2019ll have multiple life epiphanies and discover meanings no other brain ever managed to encounter. Do not be afraid of spending quality time by yourself. Find meaning or don\u2019t find meaning but \'steal\' some time and give it freely and exclusively to your own self. Opt for privacy and solitude. That doesn\u2019t make you antisocial or cause you to reject the rest of the world. But you need to breathe. And you need to be.","The evil that is in the world almost always comes from ignorance, and good intentions may do as much harm as malevolence if they lack understanding.","Au milieu de l\'hiver, j\'ai d\xe9couvert en moi un invincible \xe9t\xe9.","She was breathing deeply, she forgot the cold, the weight of beings, the insane or static life, the long anguish of living or dying. After so many years running from fear, fleeing crazily, uselessly, she was finally coming to a halt. At the same time she seemed to be recovering her roots, and the sap rose anew in her body, which was no longer trembling. Pressing her whole belly against the parapet, leaning toward the wheeling sky, she was only waiting for her pounding heart to settle down, and for the silence to form in her. The last constellations of stars fell in bunches a little lower on the horizon of the desert, and stood motionless. Then, with an unbearable sweetness, the waters of the night began to fill her, submerging the cold, rising gradually to the center of her being, and overflowing wave upon wave to her moaning mouth. A moment later, the whole sky stretched out above her as she lay with her back against the cold earth.","And he knew, also, what the old man was thinking as his tears flowed, and he, Rieux, thought it too: that a loveless world is a dead world, and always there comes an hour when one is weary of prisons, of one\'s work, and of devotion to duty, and all one craves for is a loved face, the warmth and wonder of a loving heart.","The literal meaning of life is whatever you\'re doing that prevents you from killing yourself.","You can\'t create experience, you undergo it.","I had been right, I was still right, I was always right. I had lived my life one way and I could just as well have lived it another. I had done this and I hadn\'t done that. I hadn\'t done this thing but I had done another. And so?","And never have I felt so deeplyat one and the same time so detached from myself and so present in the world.","Friendship is less simple. It is long and hard to obtain but when one has it there\'s no getting rid of it; one simply has to cope with it. Don\'t think for a minute that your friends will telephone you every evening, as they ought to, in order to find out if this doesn\'t happen to be the evening when you are deciding to commit suicide, or simply whether you don\'t need company, whether you are not in the mood to go out. No, don\'t worry, they\'ll ring up the evening you are not alone, when life is beautiful. As for suicide, they would be more likely to push you to it, by virtue of what you owe to yourself, according to them. May heaven protect us, cher Monsieur, from being set upon a pedestal by our friends!","The need to be right - the sign of a vulgar mind.","Nothing in life is worth,turning your back on,if you love it.","The evil in the world comes almost always from ignorance, and goodwill can cause as much damage as ill-will if it is not enlightened. People are more often good than bad, though in fact that is not the question. But they are more or less ignorant and this is what one calls vice or virtue, the most appalling vice being the ignorance that thinks it knows everything and which consequently authorizes itself to kill. The murderer\'s soul is blind, and there is no true goodness or fine love without the greatest possible degree of clear-sightedness.","Get scared. It will do you good. Smoke a bit, stare blankly at some ceilings, beat your head against some walls, refuse to see some people, paint and write. Get scared some more. Allow your little mind to do nothing but function. Stay inside, go out - I don\u2019t care what you\u2019ll do; but stay scared as hell. You will never be able to experience everything. So, please, do poetical justice to your soul and simply experience yourself.","A person\'s life purpose is nothing more than to rediscover, through the detours of art or love or passionate work, those one or two images in the presence of which his heart first opened.","What I\'m sure of is that you can\'t be happy without money. That\'s all. I don\'t like superficiality and I don\'t like romanticism. I like to be conscious. And what I\'ve noticed is that there\'s a kind of spiritual snobbism in certain \'superior beings\' who think that money isn\'t necessary for happiness. Which is stupid, which is false, and to a certain degree cowardly.... For a man who is well born, being happy is never complicated. It\'s enough to take up the general fate, only not with the will for renunciation like so many fake great men, but with the will for happiness. Only it takes time to be happy. A lot of time. Happiness, too, is a long patience. And in almost every case, we use up our lives making money, when we should be using our money to gain time. That\'s the only problem that\'s ever interested me.... To have money is to have time. That\'s my main point. Time can be bought. Everything can be bought. To be or to become rich is to have time to be happy, if you deserve it.... Everything for happiness, against the world which surrounds us with its violence and its stupidity.... All the cruelty of our civilization can be measured by this one axiom: happy nations have no history.","Nothing, nothing mattered, and I knew why. So did he. Throughout the whole absurd life I\'d lived, a dark wind had been rising toward me from somewhere deep in my future, across years that were still to come, and as it passed, this wind leveled whatever was offered to me at the time, in years no more real than the ones I was living. What did other people\'s deaths or a mother\'s love matter to me; what did his God or the lives people choose or the fate they think they elect matter to me when we\'re all elected by the same fate, me and billions of privileged people like him who also called themselves my brothers? Couldn\'t he see, couldn\'t he see that? Everybody was privileged. There were only privileged people. The others would all be condemned one day. And he would be condemned, too.","Much unhappiness has come into the world because of bewilderment and things left unsaid.","My dear,In the midst of hate, I found there was, within me, an invincible love.In the midst of tears, I found there was, within me, an invincible smile.In the midst of chaos, I found there was, within me, an invincible calm.I realized, through it all, that\u2026In the midst of winter, I found there was, within me, an invincible summer.And that makes me happy. For it says that no matter how hard the world pushes against me, within me, there\u2019s something stronger \u2013 something better, pushing right back.Truly yours,Albert CamusI like this because only one part is usually quoted but the full quote has such symmetry.\u201d","Mother used to say that however miserable one is, there\u2019s always something to be thankful for. And each morning, when the sky brightened and light began to flood my cell, I agreed with her.","Au milieu de l\'hiver, j\'apprenais enfin qu\'il y avait en moi un \xe9t\xe9 invincible.","Well, personally, I\'ve seen enough of people who die for an idea. I don\'t believe in heroism; I know it\'s easy and I\'ve learned that it can be murderous. What interests me is living and dying for what one loves.","Should I kill myself, or have a cup of coffee? But in the end one needs more courage to live than to kill himself.","If there were a party of those who aren\'t sure they\'re right, I\'d belong to it. (as quoted by Tony Judt)","When I was young I asked more of people than they could give: everlasting friendship, endless feeling.Now I know to ask less of them than they can give: a straightforward companionship. And their feelings, their friendship, their generous actions seem in my eyes to be wholly miraculous: a consequence of grace alone.","Likewise and during every day of an unillustrious life, time carries us. But a moment always comes when we have to carry it. We live on the future: \u201ctomorrow, \u201clater on,\u201d \u201cwhen you have made your way,\u201d \u201cyou will understand when you are old enough.\u201d Such irrelevancies are wonderful, for, after all, it\u2019s a matter of dying. Yet a day comes when a man notices or says that he is thirty. Thus he asserts his youth. But simultaneously he situates himself in relation to time. He takes his place in it. He admits that he stands at a certain point on a curve that he acknowledges having to travel to its end. He belongs to time, and by the horror that seizes him, he recognizes his worst enemy. Tomorrow, he was longing for tomorrow, whereas everything in him ought to reject it. That revolt of the flesh is the absurd.\u201d","But the heart has its own memory and I have forgotten nothing.","It is a kind of spiritual snobbery that makes people think they can be happy without money.","I knew a man who gave twenty years of his life to a scatterbrained woman, sacrificing everything to her, his friendships, his work, the very respectability of his life and who one evening recognized that he had never loved her. He had been bored, thats all, bored like most people. Hence he had made himself out of whole cloth a life full of complications and drama. Something must happen and that explains most human commitments. Something must happen even loveless slavery, even war or death.","God is not needed to create guilt or to punish. Our fellow men suffice, aided by ourselves. You were speaking of the Last Judgement. Allow me to laugh respectfully. I shall wait for it resolutely, for I have known what is worse, the judgement of men. For them, no extenuating circumstances; even the good intention is ascribed to crime. Have you at least heard of the spitting cell, which a nation recently thought up to prove itself the greatest on earth? A walled-up box in which the prisoner can stand without moving. The solid door that locks him in the cement shell stops at chin level. Hence only his face is visible, and every passing jailer spits copiously on it. The prisoner, wedged into his cell, cannot wipe his face, though he is allowed, it is true. to close his eyes. Well, that, mon cher, is a human invention.

We want love to last and we know that it does not last; even if, by some miracle, it were to last a whole lifetime, it would still be incomplete. Perhaps, in this insatiable need for perpetuation, we should better understand human suffering, if we knew that it was eternal. It appears that great minds are, sometimes, less horrified by suffering than by the fact that it does not endure. In default of inexhaustible happiness, eternal suffering would at least give us a destiny. But we do not even have that consolation, and our worst agonies come to an end one day. One morning, after many dark nights of despair, an irrepressible longing to live will announce to us the fact that all is finished and that suffering has no more meaning than happiness.","He discovered the cruel paradox by which we always decieve ourselves twice about the people we love-first to their advantage, then to their disadvantage","You are forgiven for your happiness and your successes only if you generously consent to share them.","He desired her vaguely but without convinction. They walked together. He suddenly realized that she had always been very decent to him. She had accepted him as he was and had spared him a great deal of loneliness. He had been unfair: while his imagination and vanity had given her too much importance, his pride had given her too little. He discovered the cruel paradox by which we always deceive ourselves twice about the people we love -- first to their advantage, then to their disadvantage. Today he understood that she had been genuine with him -- that she had been what she was, and that he owed her a good deal.","Whatever we may do, excess will always keep its place in the heart of man, in the place where solitude is found.

This heart within me I can feel, and I judge that it exists. This world I can touch, and I likewise judge that it exists. There ends all my knowledge, and the rest is construction. For if I try to seize this self of which I feel sure, if I try to define and to summarize it, it is nothing but water slipping through my fingers. I can sketch one by one all the aspects it is able to assume, all those likewise that have been attributed to it, this upbringing, this origin, this ardor or these silences, this nobility or this vileness.

Without it, justice seems inconceivable to the rebel\'s mind. There comes a time, however, when justice demands the suspension of freedom. Then terror, on a grand or small scale, makes its appearance to consummate the revolution. Every act of rebellion expresses a nostalgia for innocence and an appeal to the essence of being. But one day nostalgia takes up arms and assumes the responsibility of total guilt; in other words, adopts murder and violence.","O young girl, throw yourself again into the water so that I might have a second time the chance to save the two of us!\\" A second time, eh, what imprudence!

Therefore they forced themselves never to think about the problematic day of escape, to cease looking to the future, and always to keep, so to speak, their eyes fixed on the ground at their feet. But, naturally enough, this prudence, this habit of feinting with their predicament and refusing to put up a fight, was ill rewarded. For, while averting that revulsion which they found so unbearable, they also deprived themselves of those redeeming moments, frequent enough when all is told, when by conjuring up pictures of a reunion to be, they could forget about the plague. Thus, in a middle course between these heights and depths, they drifted through life rather than lived, the prey of aimless days and sterile memories, like wandering shadows that could have acquired substance only by consenting to root themselves in the solid earth of their distress.","What can a meaning outside my condition mean to me? I can understand only in human terms. What I touch, what resists me--that is what I understand. And these two certainties--my appetite for the absolute and for unity and the impossibility of reducing this world to a rational and reasonable principle--I also know that I cannot reconcile them.

The silent city was no more than an assemblage of huge, inert cubes, between which only the mute effigies of great men, carapaced in bronze, with their blank stone or metal faces, conjured up a sorry semblance of what the man had been. In lifeless squares and avenues these tawdry idols lorded it under the lowering sky; stolid monsters that might have personified the rule of immobility imposed on us, or, anyhow, its final aspect, that of a defunct city in which plague, stone, and darkness had effectively silenced every voice.","My soul\u2019s a burden to me, I\u2019ve had enough of it.

I don\u2019t belong here.","In different degrees, in every part of the town, men and women had been yearning for a reunion, not of the same kind for all, but for all alike ruled out. Most of them had longed intensely for an absent one, for the warmth of a body, for love, or merely a life that habit had endeared. Some, often without knowing it, suffered from being deprived of the company of friends and from their inability to get in touch with them through the usual channels of friendship\u2014letters, trains, and boats. Others, fewer these... had desired a reunion with something they couldn\u2019t have defined, but which seemed to them the only desirable thing on earth. For want of a better name, they sometimes called it peace.","I have to admit it humbly, mon cher compatriote, I was always bursting with vanity. I, I, I is the refrain of my whole life, which could be heard in everything I said. I could never talk without boasting, especially if I did so with that shattering discretion that was my specialty. It is quite true that I always lived free and powerful. I simply felt released in the regard to all the for the excellent reason that I recognized no equals. I always considered myself more intelligent than everyone else, as I\u2019ve told you, but also more sensitive and more skillful, a crack shot, an incomparable driver, a better lover. Even in the fields in which it was easy for me to verify my inferiority\u2013like tennis, for instance, in which I was but a passable partner\u2013it was hard for me not to think that, with a little time and practice, I would surpass the best players. I admitted only superiorities in me and this explained my good will and serenity. When I was concerned with others, I was so out of pure condescension, in utter freedom, and all the credit went to me: my self-esteem would go up a degree.","What gives value to travel is fear. It is the fact that, at a certain moment, when we are so far from our own country \u2026 we are seized by a vague fear, and an instinctive desire to go back to the protection of old habits \u2026 this is why we should not say that we travel for pleasure. There is no pleasure in traveling, and I look upon it more as an occasion for spiritual testing \u2026 Pleasure takes us away from ourselves in the same way as distraction, in Pascal\u2019s use of the word, takes us away from God. Travel, which is like a greater and a graver science, brings us back to ourselves.","The absurd does not liberate; it binds. It does not authorize all actions. \\"Everything is permitted\\" does not mean that nothing is forbidden.","To work and create \'for nothing\', to sculpture in clay, to know that one\'s creation has no future, to see one\'s work destroyed in a day while being aware that fundamentally this has no more importance than building for centuries- this is the difficult wisdom that absurd thought sanctions. Performing these two tasks simultaneously, negating on one hand and magnifying on the other, is the way open to the absurd creator. He must give the void its colors.","You make the mistake of thinking you have to choose, that you have to do what you want, that there are conditions for happiness. What matters- all that matters, really- is the will to happiness, a kind of enormous, ever present consciousness. The rest- women, art, success- is nothing but excuses.

For there to be equivalence, the death penalty would have to punish a criminal who had warned his victim of the date at which he would inflict a horrible death on him and who, from that moment onward, had confined him at his mercy for months. Such a monster is not encountered in private life.","Everybody knows that pestilences have a way of recurring in the world; yet somehow we find it hard to believe in ones that crash down on our heads from a blue sky. There have been as many plagues as wars in history; yet always plagues and wars take people equally by surprise.","For years I\u2019ve wanted to live according to everyone else\u2019s morals. I\u2019ve forced myself to live like everyone else, to look like everyone else. I said what was necessary to join together, even when I felt separate. And after all of this, catastrophe came. Now I wander amid the debris, I am lawless, torn to pieces, alone and accepting to be so, resigned to my singularity and to my infirmities. And I must rebuild a truth\u2013after having lived all my life in a sort of lie.","Ce qu\'on appelle une raison de vivre est en m\xeame temps une excellente raison de mourir.","I\u2019m going to tell you something: thoughts are never honest. Emotions are. Do not go around asking for honesty in what people think; much of what they perceive as thinking is empty anyway because it\u2019s thought out again and again and comes out refined and muddy. The ones who know how to feel might have to say to you a couple of interesting things or not and when they do that, you ought to know how to listen. So learn how to listen. You can\u2019t make someone open up about their feelings in case they don\u2019t want to. But you can remain open yourself through listening deeply and completely; they might want to talk about the weather and keep it simple \u2014 allow them to feel the simplicity\u2026Emotion pours out directly or indirectly each time people engage themselves in the process of genuine interaction.","As if this great outburst of anger had purged all my ills, killed all my hopes, I looked up at the mass of signs and stars in the night sky and laid myself open for the first time to the benign indifference of the world- and finding it so much like myself, in fact so fraternal, I realized that I\u2019d been happy, and that I was still happy. For the final consummation and for me to feel less lonely, my last wish was that there should be a crowd of spectators at my execution and that they should greet me with cries of hatred.","What we can or cannot do, what we consider possible or impossible, is rarely a function of our true capability. It is more likely a function of our beliefs about who we are.","I\'ve been thinking it over for years. While we loved each other we didn\'t need words to make ourselves understood. But people don\'t love forever. A time came when I should have found the words to keep her with me, only I couldn\'t.\\" - Grant","Happiness implied a choice, and within that choice a concerted will, a lucid desire. Only it takes time to be happy. A lot of time. Happiness, too, is a long patience","The final conclusion of the absurdist protest is, in fact, the rejection of suicide and persistence in that hopeless encounter between human questioning and the silence of the universe.","What I know, what is certain, what I cannot deny,what I cannot reject\u2014this is what counts. I can negate everythingof that part of me that lives on vague nostalgias, except this desirefor unity, this longing to solve, this need for clarity and cohesion. Ican refute everything in this world surrounding me that offends orenraptures me, except this chaos, this sovereign chance and thisdivine equivalence which springs from anarchy. I don\u2019t knowwhether this world has a meaning that transcends it. But I knowthat I do not know that meaning and that it is impossible for mejust now to know it. What can a meaning outside my conditionmean to me? I can understand only in human terms. What I touch,what resists me\u2014that is what I understand.

What othertruth can I admit without lying, without bringing in a hope I lackand which means nothing within the limits of my condition?","He realized now that to be afraid of this death he was staring at with animal terror meant to be afraid of life. Fear of dying justified a limitless attachment to what is alive in man. And all those who had not made the gestures necessary to live their lives, all those who feared and exalted impotence\u2014 they were afraid of death because of the sanction it gave to a life in which they had not been involved. They had not lived enough, never having lived at all. And death was a kind of gesture, forever withholding water from the traveler vainly seeking to slake his thirst. But for the others, it was the fatal and tender gesture that erases and denies, smiling at gratitude as at rebellion.","The loves we share with a city are often secret loves.","Ce monde, tel qu\'il est fait, n\'est pas supportable. J\'ai donc besoin de la lune, ou du bonheur, ou de l\'immortalit\xe9, de quelque chose qui soit d\xe9ment peut-\xeatre, mais qui ne soit pas de ce monde.","The welfare of the people in particular has always been the alibi of tyrants, and it provides the further advantage of giving the servants of tyranny a good conscience.","L\'habitude du desepoir est pire que le desespoir lui-meme.","We rarely confide in those who are better than we. Most often, on the other hand, we confess to those who are like us and who share our weaknesses. Hence we don\'t want to improve ourselves and be bettered, for we should first have to be judged in default. We merely wish to be pitied and encouraged in the course we have chosen.","At that time, I often thought that if I had had to live in the trunk of a dead tree, with nothing to do but look up at the sky flowing overhead, little by little I would have gotten used to it. I would have waited for the birds to fly by or the clouds to mingle, just as here I waited to see my lawyer\'s ties and just as, in another world, I used to wait patiently until Saturday to hold Marie\'s body in my arms. Now, as I think back on it, I wasn\'t in a hollow tree trunk. There were others worse off than me. Anyway, it was one of Maman\'s ideas and she often repeated it, that after awhile you could get used to anything.","After a short silence the doctor raised himself a little in his chair and asked if Tarrou had an idea of the path to follow for attaining peace.\\"Yes, he replied. \\"The path of sympathy.","A novel is never anything, but a philosophy put into images.","I couldn\'t quite understand how an ordinary man\'s good qualities could become crushing accusations against a guilty man.","And I should like to be able to love my country and still love justice.

I want to keep it alive by keeping justice alive.","There is no fate which cannot be surmounted by scorn.","I opened myself up to the gentle indifference of the world. Finding it so much like myself","The trigger gave; I felt the smooth underside of the butt; and there, in that noise, sharp and deafening at the same time, is where it all started. I shook off the sweat and the sun. I knew that I had shattered the harmony of the day, the exceptional silence of a beach where I\'d been happy. Then I fired four more times at the motionless body where the bullets lodged without leaving a trace. And it was like knocking four quick times on the door of unhappiness.","There are many causes for a suicide, and generally the most obvious ones were not the most powerful. Rarely is suicide committed (yet the hypothesis is not excluded) through reflection. What sets off the crisis is almost always unverifiable. Newspapers often speak of \\"personal sorrows\\" or of \\"incurable illness.\\" These explanations are plausible. But one would have to know whether a friend of the desperate man had not that very day addressed him indifferently. He is the guilty one. For that is enough to precipitate all the rancors and all the boredom still in suspension. But if it is hard to fix the precise instant, the subtle step when the mind opted for death, it is easier to deduce from the act itself the consequences it implies. In a sense, and as in melodrama, killing yourself amounts to confessing. It is confessing that life is too much for you or that you do not understand it. Let\'s not go too far in such analogies, however, but rather return to everyday words. It is merely confessing that that \\"is not worth the trouble.\\" Living, naturally, is never easy. You continue making the gestures commanded by existence for many reasons, the first of which is habit. Dying voluntarily implies that you have recognized, even instinctively, the ridiculous character of that habit, the absence of any profound reason for living, the insane character of that daily agitation, and the uselessness of suffering. What, then, is that incalculable feeling that deprives the mind of the sleep necessary to life? A world that can be explained even with bad reasons is a familiar world. But, on the other hand, in a universe suddenly divested of illusions and lights, man feels an alien, a stranger. His exile is without remedy since he is deprived of the memory of a lost home or the hope of a promised land. This divorce between man and his life, the actor and his setting, is properly the feeling of absurdity.","\u2026. Query: How contrive not to waste one\'s time?Answer: By being fully aware of it all the while.Ways in which this can be done: By spending one\'s days on an uneasy chair in a dentist\'s waiting-room; by remaining on one\'s balcony all of a Sunday afternoon; by listening to lectures in a language on doesn\'t know; by traveling by the longest and least-convenient train routes, and of course standing all the way; by lining up at the box-office of theaters and then not buying a seat; and so forth.","Aujourd\'hui, maman est morte.

I felt as if I understood why at the end of her life she had taken a \'fianc\xe9,\' why she had played at beginning again. Even there, in that home where lives were fading out, evening was a kind of wistful respite. So close to death, Maman must have felt free then and ready to live it all again. Nobody, nobody had the right to cry over her. And I felt ready to live it all again too. As if the blind rage had washed me clean, rid me of hope; for the first time, in that night alive with signs and stars, I opened myself to the gentle indifference of the world. Finding it so much like myself \u2014 so like a brother, really \u2014 I felt I had been happy and that I was happy again. For everything to be consummated, for me to feel less alone, I had only to wish that there be a large crowd of spectators the day of my execution and that they greet me with cries of hate.","C\'est que je n\'ai jamais grand chose \xe0 dire.

On the whole, men are more good than bad; that, however, isn\u2019t the real point. But they are more or less ignorant, and it is this that we call vice or virtue; the most incorrigible vice being that of an ignorance that fancies it knows everything and therefore claims for itself the right to kill.

What did other people\u2019s deaths or a mother\u2019s love matter to me; what did his God or the lives people choose or the fate they think they elect matter to me when we\u2019re all elected by the same fate, me and billions of privileged people like him who also called themselves my brothers?","She was wearing a pair of my pajamas with the sleeves rolled up.

One the whole, men are more good than bad; that, however, isn\'t the real point.

After a moment, however, it seemed to her that the sky above her was moving in a sort of slow gyration. In the vast reaches of the dry, cold night, thousands of stars were constantly appearing, and their sparkling icicles, loosened at once, began to slip gradually towards the horizon. Janine could not tear herself away from contemplating those drifting flares. She was turning with them, and the apparently stationary progress little by little identified her with the core of her being, where cold and desire were now vying with each other. Before her the stars were falling one by one and being snuffed out among the stones of the desert, and each time Janine opened a little more to the night. Breathing deeply, she forgot the cold, the dead weight of others, the craziness or stuffiness of life, the long anguish of living and dying. After so many years of mad, aimless fleeing from fear, she had come to a stop at last. At the same time, she seemed to recover her roots and the sap again rose in her body, which had ceased trembling. Her whole belly pressed against the parapet as she strained towards the moving sky; she was merely waiting for her fluttering heart to calm down and establish silence within her. The last stars of the constellations dropped their clusters a little lower on the desert horizon and became still. Then, with unbearable gentleness, the water of night began to fill Janine, drowned the cold, rose gradually from the hidden core of her being and overflowed in wave after wave, rising up even to her mouth full of moans. The next moment, the whole sky stretched out over her, fallen on her back on the cold earth.","I think my life is of great importance, but I also think it is meaningless.","le mal qui est dans le monde vient presque toujours de l\'ignorance","There are crimes of passion and crimes of logic.

All of us, today, are dying of this misfortune. For violence and hatred dry up the heart itself; the long fight for justice exhausts the love that nevertheless gave birth to it. In the clamor in which we live, love is impossible and justice does not suffice. This is why Europe hates daylight and is only able to set injustice up against injustice. But in order to keep justice from shriveling up like a beautiful orange fruit containing nothing but a bitter, dry pulp, I discovered once more at Tipasa that one must keep intact in oneself a freshness, a cool wellspring of joy, love the day that escapes injustice, and return to combat having won that light. Here I recaptured the former beauty, a young sky, and I measured my luck, realizing at last that in the worst years of our madness the memory of that sky had never left me. This was what in the end had kept me from despairing. I had always known that the ruins of Tipasa were younger than our new constructions or our bomb damage. There the world began over again every day in an ever new light. O light! This is the cry of all the characters of ancient drama brought face to face with their fate.

I learned something then that has always made me react to the signs of comfort or of a well-appointed house with irony, impatience, and sometimes anger. Although I live without worrying about tomorrow now, and therefore count myself among the privileged, I don\'t know how to own things. What I do have, which always comes to me without my asking for it, I can\'t seem to keep.

So long as you are alive, your case is doubtful; you have a right only to their skepticism. So if there were the least certainty that one could enjoy the show, it would be worth proving to them what they are unwilling to believe and thus amazing them. But you kill yourself and what does it matter whether or not they believe you? You are not there to see their amazement and their contrition (fleeting at best), to witness, according to every man\'s dream, your own funeral.

At certain moments of lucidity, the mechanical aspect of their gestures, their meaningless pantomime makes silly everything that surrounds them. A man is talking on the telephone behind a glass partition; you cannot hear him, but you see his incomprehensible dumb show: you wonder why he is alive.

Stupidity always carries doggedly on, as people wold notice if they were not always thinking about themselves. In this respect, the citizens of Oran were like the rest of the world, they thought about themselves, in other words, they were humanists: they did not believe in pestilence. A pestilence does not have human dimensions, so people tell themselves that it is unreal, that it is a bad dream which will end. But it does not always end and, from one bad dream to the next, it is people who end, humanists first of all because they have not prepared themselves.","It is forbidden to spit on cats in plague-time.","There is so much stubborn hope in the human heart.

Or should I sit here and do nothing, nobody\u2019s asking anything of me after all?Should I jump off the cliff that has my heart beating so and develop my wings on the way down? Or should I step back from the edge, and let the others deal with this thing called courage?Should I stare back at the existential abyss that haunts me so and try desperately to grab from it a sense of self? Or should I keep walking half-asleep, only half-looking at it every now and then in times in which I can\u2019t help doing anything but?Should I kill myself or have a cup of coffee?","I spent a long time looking at faces, drinking in smiles.

(And when I think I have caught a glimpse of the color of my fate, it flees from my gaze.) We struggle and suffer to reconquer our solitude. But a day comes when the earth has its simple and primitive smile. Then, it is as if the struggles and life within us were rubbed out. Millions of eyes have looked at this landscape, and for me it is like the first smile of the world. It takes me out of myself, in the deepest meaning of the expression. It assures me that nothing matters except my love, and that even this love has no value for me unless it remains innocent and free. It denies me a personality, and deprives my suffering of its echo. The world is beautiful, and this is everything. The great truth which it patiently teaches me is that neither the mind nor even the heart has any importance. And that the stone warmed by the stone or the cypress tree swelling against the empty sky set a boundary to the only world in which \\"to be right\\" has any meaning: nature without men. This world reduces me to nothing. It carries me to the very end. Without anger, it denies that I exist.

The absurdity peculiar to this problem comes from the fact that the very notion that makes the problem of freedom possible also takes away all its meaning. For in the presence of God there is less a problem of freedom than a problem of evil. You know the alternative: either we are not free and God the all-powerful is responsible for evil. Or we are free and responsible but God is not all powerful.

You continue making the gestures commanded by existence for many reasons, the first of which is habit. Dying voluntarily implies that you have recognized, even instinctively, the ridiculous character of that habit, the absence of any profound reason for living, the insane character of that daily agitation and the uselessness of suffering.","It is true that freedom, when it is made up principally of privileges, insults labor and separates it from culture. But freedom is not made up principally of privileges; it is made up especially of duties. And the moment each of us tries to give freedom\'s duties precedence over its privileges, freedom joins together labor and culture and sets in motion the only force that can effectively serve justice. The rule of our action, the secret of our resistance can be easily stated: everything that humiliates labor also humiliates the intelligence, and vice versa. And the revolutionary struggle, the centuries-old straining toward liberation can be defined first of all as a double and constant rejection of humiliation.","The workman of today works every day in his life at the same tasks, and this fate is no less absurd. But it is tragic only at the rare moments when it becomes conscious. Sisyphus, proletarian of the gods, powerless and rebellious, knows the whole extent of his wretched condition: it is what he thinks of during his descent. The lucidity that was to constitute his torture at the same time crowns his victory. There is no fate that cannot be surmounted by scorn.","Men like us are good and proud and strong...if we had a faith, a God, nothing could undermine us.

It is metaphysical because it contests the ends of man and of creation. The slaveprotests against the condition in which he finds himself within his state of slavery; the metaphysical rebelprotests against the condition in which he finds himself as a man. The rebel slave affirms that there issomething in him that will not tolerate the manner in which his master treats him; the metaphysical rebeldeclares that he is frustrated by the universe. For both of them, it is not only a question of pure and simplenegation.

He is solitary, languid,his condition exhausts him. If he wants to feel alive, it must be in the terrible exaltation of a brief anddestructive action. To love someone whom one will never see again is to give a cry of exultation as oneperishes in the flames of passion. One lives only in and for the moment, in order to achieve \\"the brief andvivid union of a tempestuous heart united to the tempest\\" (lermontov). The threat of mortality whichhangs over us makes everything abortive. Only the cry of anguish can bring us to life; exaltation takes theplace of truth. To this extent the apocalypse becomes an absolute value in which everything isconfounded\u2014love and death, conscience and culpability.

Properly speaking, nothing has been experienced but what has been lived and made conscious. Here, it is barely possible to speak of the experience of others\' deaths. It is a substitute, an illusion, and it never quite convinces us. That melancholy convention cannot be persuasive.","Art is the activity that exalts and denies simultaneously. \\"No artist tolerates reality,\\" says Nietzsche. Thatis true, but no artist can get along without reality. Artistic creation is a demand for unity and a rejection ofthe world.

That is the face you are asked to see.\'This perked me up a little. I said I had been looking at the stones in these walls for months. There wasn\'t anything or anyone in the world I knew better. Maybe at one time, way back, I had searched for a face in them.

The common lot of married couples. You get married, you go on loving a bit longer, you work. And you work so hard that it makes you forget to love. As the head of the office where Grand was employed hadn\'t kept his promise, Jeanne, too, had to work outside. At this point a little imagination was needed to grasp what Grand was trying to convey. Owing largely to fatigue, he gradually lost grip of himself, had less and less to say, and failed to keep alive the feeling in his wife that she was loved. An overworked husband, poverty, the gradual loss of hope in a better future, silent evenings at home, what chance had any passion of surviving such conditions? Probably Jeanne had suffered. And yet she\'d stayed; of course one may often suffer a long time without knowing it. Thus years went by. Then, one day, she left him. Naturally she hadn\'t gone alone. \\"I was very fond of you, but now I\'m so tired. I\'m not happy to go, but one needn\'t be happy to make another start.\\" That, more or less, was what she\'d said in her letter.\\tGrand, too, had suffered. And he, too, might, as Rieux pointed out, have made a fresh start. But no, he had lost faith. Only, he couldn\'t stop thinking about her. What he\'d have liked to do was to write her a letter justifying himself. \\"But it\'s not easy,\\" he told Rieux. \\"I\'ve been thinking it over for years.

In certain situations, replying \u201cnothing when asked what one is thinking about may be pretense in a man. Those who are loved are well aware of this. But if that reply is sincere, if it symbolizes that odd state of soul in which the void becomes eloquent, in which the chain of daily gestures is broken, in which the heart vainly seeks the link that will connect it again, then it is as it were the first sign of absurdity.\u201d","When one has once had the good luck to love intensely, life is spent in trying to recapture that ardor and that illumination.

And I know too that we must keep endless watch on ourselves lest in careless moment we breathe in somebody\'s face and fasten the infection on him. What\'s natural is the microbe. All the rest- health integrity purity if you like - is a product of the human will of vigilance that must never falter. The good man the man who infects hardly anyone is the man who has the fewest lapses of attention. And it needs tremendous will-power a never ending tension of the mind to avoid such lapses. Yes Rieux it\'s a wearying business being plague-stricken. But it\'s still more wearying to refuse to be it. That\'s why everybody in the world today looks so tired everyone is more or less sick of plague. But that is also why some of us who want to get the plague out of their systems feel such desperate weariness a weariness from which nothing remains to set us free except death.","For the Greeks, values existed a priori and marked out the exact limits of every action. Modern philosophy places its values at the completion of action. They are not, but they become, and we shall know them completely only at the end of history. When they disappear, limits vanish as well, and since ideas differ as to what these values will be, since there is no struggle which, unhindered by these same values, does not extend indefinitely, we are now witnessing the Messianic forces confronting one another, their clamors merging in the shock of empires. Excess is a fire, according to Heraclitus. The fire is gaining ground; Nietzsche has been overtaken.

A sudden love, a great work, a decisive act, a thought which transfigures, all these at certain moments bring the same unbearable anxiety, linked with an irresistible charm.","I see many people die because they judge that life is not worth living. I see others paradoxically getting killed for the ideas or illusions that give them a reason for living (what is called a reason for living is also an excellent reason for dying).","I was at ease in everything, to be sure, but at the same time satisfied with nothing. Each joy made me desire another. I went from festivity to festivity. On occasion I danced for nights on end, ever madder about people and life. At times, late on those nights when the dancing, the slight intoxication, my wild enthusiasm, everyone\u2019s violent unrestraint would fill me with a tired and overwhelmed rapture, it would seem to me\u2014at the breaking point of fatigue and for a second\u2019s flash\u2014that at last I understood the secret; I would rush forth anew. I ran on like that, always heaped with favors, never satiated, without knowing where to stop, until the day \u2014 until the evening rather when the music stopped and the lights went out.","When a man has learned how to remain alone with his suffering, how to overcome his longing to flee, then he has little left to learn.","Absolute freedom mocks at justice. Absolute justice denies freedom. Tobe fruitful, the two ideas must find their limits in each other. No man considers that his condition is free ifit is not at the same time just, nor just unless it is free. Freedom, precisely, cannot even be imaginedwithout the power of saying clearly what is just and what is unjust, of claiming all existence in the nameof a small part of existence which refuses to die.","Gazing up at the dark sky spangled with its signs and stars, for the first time, the first, I laid my heart open to the benign indifference of the universe","Only the one who does not know what is life may believe that it is beautiful and easy.","Indeed, a climate of fear is not one that encourages reflection. However, it is my belief that, instead of using that fear as an excuse, we should recognize it as one of the prime causes of the current situation and try to find a remedy for it.","Men who share the same rooms, soldiers or prisoners, develop a strange alliance as if, having cast off their armor with their clothing, they fraternized every evening, over and above their differences, in the ancient community of dream and fatigue.","I loved them, according to the hallowed expression, which amounts to saying that I never loved any of them.","She had accepted him as he was and had spared him a great deal of loneliness. He had been unfair: while his imagination and vanity had given her too much importance, his pride had given her too little.

It teaches that a man defines himself by his make-believe as well as by his sincere impulses.","Le mal qui est dans le monde vient presque toujours de l\'ignorance, et la bonne volont\xe9 peut faire autant de d\xe9g\xe2ts que la m\xe9chancet\xe9, si elle n\'est pas \xe9clair\xe9e.

But then the inability to love is a privilege of the noble hearts.","Ce monde est sans importance et qui le reconnait conquiert sa libert\xe9.","Those who prefer their principles over their happiness, they refuse to be happy outside the conditions they seem to have attached to their happiness. If they are happy by surprise, they find themselves disabled, unhappy to be deprived of their unhappiness.","There is only one liberty, to come to terms with death, thereafter anything is possible.","At the heart of all beauty lies something inhuman, and these hills, the softness of the sky, the outline of these trees at this very minute lose the illusory meaning with which we had clothed them, henceforth more remote than a lost paradise. The primitive hostility of the world rises up to face us across millennia. For a second we cease to understand it because for centuries we have understood in it solely the images and designs that we had attributed to it beforehand, because henceforth we lack the power to make use of that artifice. The world evades us because it becomes itself again. That stage scenery masked by habit becomes again what it is. It withdraws at a distance from us. Just as there are days when under the familiar face of a woman, we see as a stranger her we had loved months or years ago, perhaps we shall come even to desire what suddenly leaves us so alone. But the time has not yet come. Just one thing: that denseness and that strangeness of the world is the absurd.","The actor\'s realm is that of the fleeting. Of all kinds of fame, it is known, his is the most ephemeral. At least, this is said in conversation. But all kinds of fame are ephemeral. From the point of view of Sirius, Goethe\'s works in ten thousand years will be dust and his name forgotten.","I grant we should add a third category: that of the true healers. But it is a fact one doesn\'t come across many of them, and anyhow it must be a hard vocation. That\'s why I decided to take, in every predicament, the victim\'s side, so as to reduce the damage done. Among them I can at least try to discover how on attains to the third category; in other words, to peace.","As always, whenever I want to get rid of someone I\'m not really listening to, I made it appear as if I agreed.","In the age of ideologies, we must make up our minds about murder. If murder has rational foundations, then our period and we ourselves have significance. If it has no such foundations, then we are plunged into madness there is no way out except to find some significance or to desist.","Ma patrie, c\'est la langue fran\xe7aise.","I would have liked to have tried explaining to him cordially, almost affectionately, that I had never been able to truly feel remorse for anything.

Deep down I knew perfectly well that it doesn\'t much matter whether you die at thirty or at seventy, since in either case other men and women will naturally go on living\u2014 and for thousands of years...At that point, what would disturb my train of thought was the terrifying leap I would feel my heart take at the idea of having twenty more years of life ahead of me. But I simply had to stifle it by imagining what I\u2019d be thinking in twenty years when it would all come down to the same thing anyway. Since we\u2019re all going to die, it\u2019s obvious that when and how don\u2019t matter...It would take all my strength to quiet my heart, to be rational...Throughout the whole absurd life I\u2019d lived, a dark wind had been rising toward me from somewhere deep in my future, across years that were still to come, and as it passed, this wind leveled whatever was offered to me at the time, in years no more real than the ones I was living...for the first time, in that night alive with signs and stars, I opened myself to the gentle indifference of the world...For everything to be consummated, for me to feel less alone, I had only to wish that there be a large crowd of spectators the day of my execution and that they greet me with cries of hate.","...I had never been able to truly feel remorse for anything.

Every manifestation of power, every excess, is thus covered by this \\"It is so.\\" That the artist, particularly the poet, should be demoniac is a very ancient idea, which is formulated provocatively in the work of the romantics. At this period there is even an imperialism of evil, whose aim is to annex everything, even the most orthodox geniuses. \\"What made Milton write with constraint,\\" Blake observes, \\"when he spoke of angels and of God, and with audacity when he spoke of demons and of hell, is that he was a real poet and on the side of the demons, without knowing it.\\" The poet, the genius, man himself in his most exalted image, therefore cry out simultaneously with Satan: \\"So farewell hope, and with hope farewell fear, farewell remorse. . . . Evil, be thou my good.\\" It is the cry of outraged innocence.","Weariness comes at the end of the acts of a mechanical life, but at the same time it inaugurates the impulse of consciousness. It awakens consciousness and provokes what follows. What follows is the gradual return into the chain or it is the definitive awakening. At the end of the awakening comes, in time, the consequence: suicide or recovery. In itself weariness has something sickening about it. Here, I must conclude that it is good. For everything begins with consciousness and nothing is worth anything except through it.","This world in itself is not reasonable, that is all that can be said. But what is absurd is the confrontation of this irrational and the wild longing for clarity whose call echoes in the human heart.","J\'\xe9tais \xe0 l\'aise en tout, il est vrai, mais en m\xeame temps satisfait de rien.

Others, fewer these, Tarrou may have been one of them, had desired reunion with something they couldn\'t have defined, but which seemed to them the only desirable thing on earth.

The people fate had imposed on him, the world as it appeared to him, everything in his life he had not been able to avoid...For the rest, for everything he had to choose, he made himself love, which is not the same thing. No doubt he had known the feeling of wonderment, passion, and even moments of tenderness. But each moment had sent him on to other moments, each person to others, and he had loved nothing he had chosen, except what was little by little imposed on him by circumstance, had lasted as much by accident as by intention, and finally became necessary: Jessica.","To decide that a man must be definitively punished is to deny him any further opportunity whatsoever to make reparation for his acts... This right to live that coincides with the opportunity for reparation is the natural right of every man, even the worst. The most wretched criminal and the worthiest judge here find themselves side by side, equally miserable and jointly responsible. Without this right, the moral life is strictly impossible. None among us is entitled to despair of a single man, unless it be after his death, which transforms his life into destiny and admits of a final judgment. But to pronounce this final judgment before death, to decree the closing of accounts when the creditor is still alive, is the privilege of no man. On these grounds, at least, he who judges absolutely condemns himself absolutely. ...It is because man is not fundamentally good that no one among us can set himself up as an absolute judge, for no one among us can pretend to absolute innocence. The verdict of capital punishment destroys the only indisputable human community there is, the community in the face of death, and such a judgment can only be legitimated by a truth or a principle that takes its place above all men, beyond the human condition.","No, he would never know his father, who would continue to sleep over there, his face for ever lost in the ashes. There was a mystery about that man, a mystery he had wanted to penetrate. But after all there was only the mystery of poverty that creates beings without names and without a past, that sends them into the vast throng of the nameless dead who made the world while they themselves were destroyed for ever. For it was just that that his father had in common with the men of the Labrador. The Mahon people of the Sahel, the Alsatians on the high plateaus, with this immense island between sand and sea, which the enormous silence was now beginning to envelop: the silence of anonymity; it enveloped blood and courage and work and instinct, it was at once cruel and compassionate. And he who had wanted to escape from the country without name, from the crowd and from a family without a name, but in whom something had gone on craving darkness and anonymity - he too was a member of the tribe, marching blindly into the night near the old doctor who was panting at his right, listening to the gusts of music coming from the square, seeing once more the hard inscrutable faces of the Arabs around the bandstands, Veillard\'s laughter and his stubborn face - also seeing with a sweetness and a sorrow that wrung his heart the deathly look on his mother\'s face at the time of the bombing - wandering though the night of the years in the land of oblivion where each one is the first man, where he had to bring himself up, without a father, having never known those moments when a father would call his son, after waiting for him to reach the age of listening, to tell him the family\'s secret, or a sorrow of long ago, or the experience of his life, those moments when even the ridiculous and hateful Polonius all of a sudden becomes great when he is speaking to Laertes; and he was sixteen, then he was twenty, and no one had spoken to him, and he had to learn by himself, to grow alone, in fortitude, in strength, find his own morality and truth, at last to be born as a man and then to be born in a harder childbirth, which consists of being born in relation to others, to women, like all the men born in this country who, one by one, try to learn without roots and without faith, and today all of them are threatened with eternal anonymity and the loss of the only consecrated traces of their passage on this earth, the illegible slabs in the cemetery that the night has now covered over; they had to learn how to live in relation to others, to the immense host of the conquerors, now dispossessed, who had preceded them on this land and in whom they now had to recognise the brotherhood of race and destiny.","The evil that is in the world always comes of ignorance, and good intentions may do as much harm as malevolence, if they lack understanding. On the whole, men are more good than bad; that, however, isn\'t the real point, but they are more or less ignorant, and it is this that we call vice or virtue; the most incorrigible vice being that of an ignorance that fancies it knows everything and therefore claims for itself the right to kill. The soul of the murderer is blind; and there can be no true goodness nor true love without the utmost clear-sightedness.","The demand for happiness and the patient quest for it.

It took me a long time to learn that; now I know it.","I want everything to be explained to me or nothing. And the reason is impotent when it hears this cry from the heart.

Then the time of exile begins, the endless search for justification, the aimless nostalgia, \'the most painful, the most heartbreaking question, that of the heart which asks itself: where can I feel at home?","You never believed in the meaning of this world, and you therefore deduced the idea that everything was equivalent and that good and evil could be defined according to one\'s wishes. You supposed that in the absence of any human or divine code the only values were those of the animal world\u2014in other words, violence and cunning. Hence you concluded that man was negligible and that his soul could be killed, that in the maddest of histories the only pursuit for the individual was the adventure of power and his own morality, the realism of conquests.","As I usually do when I want to get rid of someone whose conversation bores me, I pretended to agree.","Men who share the same rooms, soldiers or prisoners, develop a strange alliance as if, having cast off their armour with their clothing, they fraternized every evening, over and above their differences, in the ancient community of dream and fatigue.","And despite the clamors and the violence, we tried to preserve in our hearts the memory of a happy sea, of a remembered hill, the smile of a beloved face.","Before her the stars were falling one by one and being snuffed out among the stones of the desert, and each time Janine opened a little more to the night. Breathing deeply, she forgot the cold, the dead weight of others, the craziness or stuffiness of life, the long anguish of living and dying. After so many years of mad, aimless fleeing from fear, she had come to a stop at last.","Week after week we were reduced to starting the same letter over again and copying out the same appeals, so that after a certain time words which had at first been torn bleeding from our hearts became void of sense. We copied them down mechanically, trying by means of these dead words to give some idea of our ordeal. And in the end, the conventional call of a telegram seemed to us preferable to this sterile, obstinate monologue and this arid conversation with a blank wall.","Then, already, it had brought to his mind the silence brooding over beds in which he had let men die. There as here it was the same solemn pause, the lull that follows battle; it was the silence of defeat. But the silence now enveloping his dead friend, so dense, so much akin to the nocturnal silence of the streets and of the town set free at last, made Rieux cruelly aware that this defeat was final, the last disastrous battle that ends a war and makes peace itself an ill beyond all remedy. The doctor could not tell if Tarrou had found peace, now that all was over, but for himself he had a feeling that no peace was possible to him henceforth, any more than there can an armistice for a mother bereaved of a son or for a man who buries his friend.","A world that can be explained even with bad reasons is a familiar world. But, on the other hand, in a universe suddenly divested of illusions and lights, man feels an alien, a stranger. His exile is without remedy since he is deprived of the memory of a lost home or the hope of a promised land.","And when one day Rambert told him that he liked waking up at four in the morning and thinking of his beloved Paris, the doctor guessed easily enough, basing this on his own experience, that that was his favorite time for conjuring up pictures of the woman from whom he now was parted. This was, indeed, the hour when he could feel surest she was wholly his. Till four in the morning one is seldom doing anything and at that hour, even if the night has been a night of betrayal, one is asleep. Yes, everyone sleeps at that hour, and this is reassuring, since the great longing of an unquiet heart is to possess constantly and consciously the loved one, or, failing that, to be able to plunge the loved one, when a time of absence intervenes, into a dreamless sleep timed to last unbroken until the day they meet again.","And when it comes down to it, you realize that no one is really capable of thinking of anyone else, even in the worst misfortune. Because thinking about someone really means thinking about that person minute by minute, not being distracted by anything \u2013 not housework, not a fly passing, not meals, not an urge to scratch oneself. But there are always flies and itches. This is why life is hard to live. And these people know that very well.","I was about to tell him he was wrong to dwell on it, because it really didn\'t matter. But he cut me off and urged me one last time, drawing himself up to his full height and asking me if I believed in God. I said no. He sat down indignantly. He said it was impossible; all men believed in God, even those who turn their backs on him. That was his belief, and if he were ever to doubt it, his life would become meaningless. \\"Do you want my life to be meaningless?\\" he shouted. As far as I could see, it didn\'t have anything to do with me, and I told him so. But from across the table he had already thrust the crucifix in my face and was screaming irrationally, \\"I am a Christian. I ask Him to forgive you for sins. How can you not believe that He suffered for you?\\" I was struck by how sincere he seemed, but I had had enough. It was getting hotter and hotter.

As for me, i forgot. I never remembered anything but myself.","The hearing was adjourned. For a few brief moments, as I left the Law Courts on my way to the van, I recognised the familiar smells and colours of a summer evening. In the darkness of my mobile prison I rediscovered one by one, as if rising from the depths of my fatigue, all the familiar sounds of a town that I loved and of a certain time of day when I sometimes used to feel happy. The cries of the newspaper sellers in the languid evening air, the last few birds in the square, the shouts of the sandwich sellers, the moaning of the trams high in the winding streets of the town and the murmuring of the sky before darkness spills over onto the port, all these sounds marked out an invisible route which I knew so well before going into prison. Yes, this was the time of day when, long ago, I used to feel happy. What always awaited me then was a night of easy, dreamless sleep. And yet something had changed, for with the prospect of the coming day, it was to my cell that I returned. As if a familiar journey under a summer sky could as easily end in prison as in innocent sleep.","I said that people never change their lives, that in any case one life was as good as another and that I wasn\u2019t dissatisfied with mine here at all.","Squeezed against each other in the heavy heat, they were silent...looking toward the home that was expecting them--quiet, perspiring, resigned to this existence divided among a soulless job, long trips coming and going in an uncomfortable trolley, and at the end an abrupt sleep. On some evenings it would sadden Jacques to look at them. Until then he had only known the riches and the joys of poverty. But now heat and boredom and fatigue were showing him their curse, the curse of work so stupid you could weep and so interminably monotonous that it made the days too long and, at the same time, life too short.","Thinking of the future, establishing aims for oneself, having preferences\u2014all this presupposes a belief in freedom, even if one occasionally ascertains that one doesn\'t feel it.","Storm sky in August. Gusts of hot wind. Black clouds. Yet in the East is a delicate, transparent band of blue sky. Impossible to look at it.

And to have accepted that solitude, to know that henceforth he was the master of all his days to come, filled him with the melancholy that is attached to all greatness.","It occurred to me that anyway one more Sunday was over, that Maman was buried now, that I was going back to work, and that, really, nothing had changed.","When the time to die comes, it does not matter how and when it happens.","Les hommes ne sont convaincus de vos raisons, de votre sinc\xe9rit\xe9, et de la gravit\xe9 de vos peines, que par votre mort.

He had been bored, that\u2019s all, bored like most people. Hence he had made himself out of whole cloth a life full of complications and drama. Something must happen and that explains most human commitments. Something must happen even loveless slavery, even war or death.","Ah, mon cher, we are odd, wretched creatures, and if we merely look back over our lives, there\u2019s no lack of occasions to amaze and horrify ourselves.

It has already been felt what solution might be given. At this point the problem is reversed. It was previously a question of finding out whether or not life had to have a meaning to be lived. It now becomes clear, on the contrary, that it will be lived all the better if it has no meaning. Living an experience, a particular fate, is accepting it fully. Now, no one will live this fate, knowing it to be absurd, unless he does everything to keep before him that absurd brought to light by consciousness.","Je ne sais plus si je vis ou si je me souviens.","A character is never the author who created him.

Art cannot be a monologue. When the most solitary and least famous artist appeals to posterity, he is merely reaffirming his fundamental vocation. Considering a dialogue with deaf or inattentive contemporaries to be impossible, he appeals to a more far-reaching dialogue with the generations to come. But in order to speak about all and to all, one has to speak of what all know and of the reality common to us all. The sea, rains, necessity, desire, the struggle against death\u2014these are the things that unite us all. We resemble one another in what we see together, in what we suffer together. Dreams change from individual to individual, but the reality of the world is common to us all.","But I fired four shots more into the inert body, on which they left no visible trace. And each successive shot was another loud, fateful rap on the door of my undoing.","Everything I know of morality, I learned on the soccer field.","Even the sea had lost its deep blue colour and, beneath the misty sky, took on the sheen of silver or iron, making it painful to look at.","It seems that the people of Oran are like that friend of Flaubert who, on the point of death, casting a last glance at the irreplaceable earth, exclaimed: \\"Close the window, it\'s too beautiful.","Their pleasures are fierce and their sleep impenetrable. And they know that the body has a soul in which the soul has no part.","No doubt, our love persisted, but in practice it served nothing; it was an inert mass within us, sterile as crime of a life sentence. It had declined on a patience that led nowhere, a dogged expectation.","It is a matter of persisting. At a certain point on his path the absurd man is tempted. History is not lacking in either religions or prophets, even without gods. He is asked to leap. All he can reply is that he doesn\'t fully understand, that it is not obvious. Indeed, he does not want to do anything but what he fully understands. He is assured that this is the sin of pride, but he does not understand the notion of sin; that perhaps hell is in store, but he has not enough imagination to visualize that strange future; that he is losing immortal life, but that seems to him an idle consideration. An attempt is made to get him to admit his guilt. He feels innocent. To tell the truth, that is all he feels \u2014 his irreparable innocence. This is what allows him everything. Hence, what he demands of himself is to live solely with what he knows, to accommodate himself with what is, and to bring in nothing that is not certain. He is told that nothing is. But this at least is certainty. And it is with this that he is concerned: he wants to find out if it is possible to live without appeal.","Despairing of love and of chastity, I at last bethought myself of debauchery, a substitute for love, which quiets the laughter, restores silence, and above all, confers immortality.

The absurd is essentially a divorce. It lies in neither of the elements compared; it is born of their confrontation.","he doesn\'t play the game ... He refuses to lie. Lying is not only saying what isn\'t true. It is also, in fact especially, saying more than is true and, in the case of the human heart, saying more than one feels. We all do it, every day, to make life simpler. But Meursault, contrary to appearances, doesn\'t want to make life simpler. He says what he is, he refuses to hide his feelings and society immediately feels threatened.","And the wave of tenderness and pity that at once filled his heart was not the stirring of the soul that leads the son to the memory of the vanished father, but the overwhelming compassion that a grown man feels for an unjustly murdered child \u2013 something here was not in the natural order and, in truth, there was no order but only madness and chaos when the son was older than the father. The course of time itself was shattering around him while he remained motionless among those tombs he now no longer saw, and the years no longer kept to their places in the great river that flows to its end. They were no more than waves and surf and eddies where Jacques Cormery was not struggling in the grip of anguish and pity. He looked at the other inscriptions in that section and realized from the dates that this soil was strewn with children who had been the fathers of graying men who thought they were living in this present time. For he too believed he was living, he alone had created himself, he knew his own strength, his vigor, he could cope and he had himself well in hand. But, in the strange dizziness of that moment, the statue every man eventually erects and that hardens in the fire of the years, into which he then creeps and there awaits its final crumbling \u2013 that statue was rapidly cracking, it was already collapsing. All that was left was this anguished heart, eager to live, rebelling against the deadly order of the world that had been with him for forty years, and still struggling against the wall that separated him from the secret of all life, wanting to go farther, to go beyond, and to discover, discover before dying, discover at last in order to be, just once to be, for a single second, but forever.","There is only one really serious philosophical problem, and that is suicide.","Nostalgia is stronger here than knowledge...[Reason] is an instrument of thought and not thought itself. Above all, a man\'s thought is his nostalgia.","But hell can endure for only a limited period, and life will begin again one day. History may perhaps havean end; but our task is not to terminate it but to create it, in the image of what we henceforth know to betrue. Art, at least, teaches us that man cannot be explained by history alone and that he also finds a reasonfor his existence in the order of nature. For him, the great god Pan is not dead. His most instinctive act ofrebellion, while it affirms the value and the dignity common to all men, obstinately claims, so as to satisfyits hunger for unity, an integral part of the reality whose name is beauty. One can reject all history and yetaccept the world of the sea and the stars. The rebels who wish to ignore nature and beauty are condemnedto banish from history everything with which they want to construct the dignity of existence and of labor.Every great reformer tries to create in history what Shakespeare, Cervantes, Moliere, and Tolstoy knewhow to create: a world always ready to satisfy the hunger for freedom and dignity which every mancarries in his heart. Beauty, no doubt, does not make revolutions. But a day will come when revolutionswill have need of beauty. The procedure of beauty, which is to contest reality while endowing it withunity, is also the procedure of rebellion. Is it possible eternally to reject injustice without ceasing toacclaim the nature of man and the beauty of the world? Our answer is yes. This ethic, at once unsubmissiveand loyal, is in any event the only one that lights the way to a truly realistic revolution. In upholdingbeauty, we prepare the way for the day of regeneration when civilization will give first place\u2014far aheadof the formal principles and degraded values of history\u2014to this living virtue on which is founded thecommon dignity of man and the world he lives in, and which we must now define in the face of a worldthat insults it.","If Aliosha had come to the conclusion that neither God nor immortality existed, he would immediately have become an atheist and a socialist. For socialism is not only a question of the working classes; it is above all, in its contemporary incarnation, a question of atheism, a question of the tower of Babel, which is constructed without God\'s help, not to reach to the heavens, but to bring the heavens down to earth.","Cr\xe9er des morts conscientes, c\'est diminuer la distance qui nous s\xe9pare du monde, et entrer sans joie dans l\'accomplissement, conscient des images exaltantes d\'un monde \xe0 jamais perdu.","Il m\'a demand\xe9 alors si je n\'\xe9tais pas int\xe9ress\xe9 par un changement de vie.

Everything is forgotten, even a great love. That\'s what\'s sad about life, and also what\'s wonderful about it. There is only a way of looking at things, a way that comes to you every once in a while. That\'s why it\'s good to have had love in your life after all, to have had an unhappy passion - it gives you an alibi for the vague despairs we all suffer from.","You have heard, of course, of those tiny fish in the rivers of Brazil that attack the unwary swimmer by thousands and with swift little nibbles clean him up in a few minutes, leaving only an immaculate skeleton?

Because toconquer God, to make Him a slave, amounts to abolishing the transcendence that kept the former mastersin power and to preparing, with the ascendancy of the new tyrants, the advent of the man-king.

Every night, towards 2 a.m., quite a number of drunk men, ejected from the caf\xe9s , staggered down the streets, vociferating optimism.","There is no country for those who despair, but I know that the sea comes before and after me, and hold my madness ready. Those who love and are seperated can live in grief, but this is not despair: they know that love exists. This is why I suffer,dry-eyed, in exile. I am still waiting. A day comes, at last . . .","We call love what binds us to certain creatures only by reference to a collective way of seeing for which books and legends are responsible.","Nietzsche clamored for aRoman Caesar with the soul of Christ. To his mind, this was to say yes to both slave and master. But, inthe last analysis, to say yes to both was to give one\'s blessing to the stronger of the two\u2014namely, themaster. Caesar must inevitably renounce the domination of the mind and choose to rule in the realm offact. \\"How can one make the best of crime?\\" asks Nietzsche, as a good professor faithful to his system.Caesar must answer: by multiplying it. \\"When the ends are great,\\" Nietzsche wrote to his own detriment,\\"humanity employs other standards and no longer judges crime as such even if it resorts to the mostfrightful means.\\" He died in 1900, at the beginning of the century in which that pretension was to becomefatal.","It was in vain that he exclaimed in his hour of lucidity, \\"It is easy to talk about all sorts of immoralacts; but would one have the courage to carry them through?

Nietzsche\'s responsibility lies in having legitimized, for reasons of method\u2014and even if only for an instant\u2014the opportunity for dishonesty ofwhich Dostoievsky had already said that if one offered it to people, one could always be sure of seeingthem rushing to seize it.","Ve ben, bu gece, ya\u015fam\u0131n belirli bir saydaml\u0131\u011f\u0131 kar\u015f\u0131s\u0131nda hi\xe7bir \u015feyin \xf6nemi kalmad\u0131\u011f\u0131 i\xe7in ki\u015finin \xf6lmek isteyebilmesini anl\u0131yorum.

And don\'t all my stories, true or false, tend toward the same conclusion? Don\'t they all have the same meaning? So what does it matter whether they are true or false if, in both cases, they are significant of what I have been and of what I am? Sometimes it is easier to see clearly into the liar than into the man who tells the truth. Truth, like light, blinds. Falsehood, on the contrary, is a beautiful twilight that enhances every object.","The beginning of war is similar to the beginning of peace \u2014 the world and the heart know nothing about it.","One recognizes one\'s course by discovering the paths that stray from it","Have you observed that only death awakens our feelings? How we love the friends who have just departed - don\'t you find? How we admire those of our masters who have been silenced, their mouths full of dirt! Then our tributes come naturally, tributes that they may have waited all their lives to hear. But do you know why we are always fairer and more generous towards the dead? The reason is simple! We have no obligation where they\'re concerned! They leave us free, we can take our time, fit the tribute into the interval between cocktails and a nice mistress, in other words, lost moments. If they did oblige us to do anything, it would be to remember, and our memories are short. No, what we like in our friends is fresh death, painful death, our own feelings, in short, ourselves!","What is there more real, for instance, in our universe than a man\'s life, and how can we hope to preserve it better than a realistic film? But under what conditions is such a film possible? Under purely imaginary conditions. We should have to presuppose, in fact, an ideal camera focused on the man day and night and constantly registering his every move. The very projection of such a film would last a lifetime and could be seen only by an audience of people willing to waste their lives in watching someone else\'s life in great detail. Even under such conditions, such an unimaginable film would not be realistic for the simple reason that the reality of a man\'s life is not limited to the spot in which he happens to be. It lies also in other lives that give shape to his--lives of people he loves, to begin with, which would have to be filmed too, and also lives of unknown people, influential and insignificant, fellow citizens, policemen, professors, invisible comrades from the mines and foundries, diplomats and dictators, religious reformers, artists who create myths that are decisive for out conduct--humble representatives, in short, of the sovereign chance that dominates the most routine existences. Consequently, there is but one possible realistic film: one that is constantly shown us by an invisible camera on the world\'s screen. The only realistic artist, then, is God, if he exists. All other artists are, ipso facto, unfaithful to reality.","He discovered the cruel paradox by which we always deceive ourselves twice about the people we love\u2014first to their advantage, then to their disadvantage.","He has forgotten how to hope. This hell of the present is his Kingdom at last. All problems recover their sharp edge. Abstract evidence retreats before the poetry of forms and colors.

He was being judged by what he had been. Just as dogs don\'t change character, men are dogs to one another.","We live in a world where one needs to choose - to be the victim or the executioner, and nothing else.","Is one to die voluntarily or to hope in spite of everything?","We have no need of God to create guilt or to punish. Our fellow men are enough, with our help.","On days when the tragedy which had robbed him of his life was too much for him, he took out this letter, which he had not dated and which explained his desire to die. Then he laid the gun on the table, bent down to it and pressed his forehead against it, rolling his temples over it, calming the fever of his cheeks against the cold steel. For a long time he stayed like that, letting his fingers caress the trigger, lifting the safety catch, until the world fell silent around him and his whole being, already half-asleep, united with the sensation of the cold, salty metal from which death could emerge. Realizing then that it would be enough for him to date his letter and pull the trigger, discovering the absurd feasibility of death, he knew his imagination was vivid enough to show him the full horror of what life\u2019s negation meant for him, and he drowned in his somnolence all his craving to live, to go on burning in dignity and silence. Then, waking completely, his mouth full of already bitter saliva, he would lick the gun barrel, sticking his tongue into it and sucking out an impossible happiness.","Next day Tarrou set to work and enrolled a first team of workers, soon to be followed by many others.However, it is not the narrator\'s intention to ascribe to these sanitary groups more importance than their due. Doubtless today many of our fellow citizens are apt to yield to the temptation of exaggerating the services they rendered. But the narrator is inclined to think that by attributing overimportance to praiseworthy actions one may, by implication, be paying indirect but potent homage to the worse side of human nature. For this attitude implies that such actions shine out as rare exceptions, while callousness and apathy are the general rule.The narrator does not share that view. The evil that is in the world always comes of ignorance, and good intentions may do as much harm as malevolence, if they lack understanding. On the whole, men are more good than bad; that, however, isn\'t the real point. But they are more or less ignorant, and it is this that we call vice or virtue; the most incorrigible vice being that of an ignorance that fancies it knows everything and therefore claims for itself the right to kill.","Even the most gifted person needs someone to initiate him. The one that life puts in your path one day, that person must be loved and respected for ever, even if he\'s not responsible. That is my faith!","Tell me about yourselves and describe the sun to a miserable wretch who has no roots anywhere and who remains your faithful.","A moment later she asked me if I loved her. I said that sort of question had no meaning, really; but I supposed I didn\u2019t.","You make the mistake of thinking you have to choose, that you have to do what you want, that there are conditions for happiness. What matters\u2014all that matters, really\u2014is the will to happiness, a kind of enormous, ever-present consciousness. The rest\u2014women, art, success\u2014is nothing but excuses. A canvas waiting for our embroideries.","Le suicide est une solution \xe0 l\'absurde.","But as soon as a man, through lack of character, takes refuge in doctrine, as soon as crime reasons about itself, it multiplies like reason itself and assumes all the aspects of the syllogism. Once crime was as solitary as a cry of protest; now it is as universal as science. Yesterday it was put on trial; today it determines the law.","In the long run one gets used to anything.","Well, Mr. Antichrist, that\u2019s all for the present!","A partir do momento em que \xe9 reconhecido, o absurdo \xe9 uma paix\xe3o, a mais dilacerante de todas.","In any case, the one man paved the way for the deeds of the other, in a sense foreshadowed and even legitimized by them.","Fascism wants to establish the advent of the Nietzschean superman.It immediately discovers that God, if He exists, may well be this or that, but He is primarily the master ofdeath. If man wants to become God, he arrogates to himself the power of life or death over others.Manufacturer of corpses and of sub-men, he is a sub-man himself and not God, but the ignoble servant ofdeath","People always think that a suicide is commited for one reason. But it is perfectly possible to commit a suicide for two reasons.","Above all, don\u2019t believe your friends when they ask you to be sincere with them. They merely hope you will encourage them in the good opinion they have of themselves by providing them with the additional assurance they will find in your promise of sincerity.","Mais il n\'y a pas de limites pour aimer et que m\'importe de mal \xe9treindre si je peux tout embrasser.","How far is one to go to elude nothing? Is one to die voluntarily or to hope in spite of everything?","All those who are struggling for freedom today are ultimately fighting for beauty.","In any case, if the reader would have a correct idea of the mood of these exiles, we must conjure up once more those dreary evenings, sifting down through a haze of dust and golden light upon the treeless streets filled with teeming crowds of men and women. For, characteristically, the sound that rose towards the terraces still bathed in the last glow of daylight, now that the noises of vehicles and motors--the sole voice of cities in ordinary times--had ceased, was but one vast rumour of low voices and incessant footfalls, the drumming of innumerable soles timed to the eerie whistling of the plague in the sultry air above, the sound of a huge concourse of people marking time, a never-ending, stifling drone that, gradually swelling, filled the town from end to end, and evening after evening gave its truest, mournfullest expression to the blind endurance which had ousted love from all our hearts.","For three years,\u2019 says Kirilov, \u2018I sought the attribute of my divinity and I have found it. The attribute of my divinity is independence.\u2019 Now can be seen the meaning of Kirilov\u2019s premiss: \u2018If God does not exist, I am god.\u2019 To become god is merely to be free on this earth, not to serve an immortal being.","And I tried to listen again, because the prosecutor started talking about my soul.","\u0628\u06cc\u200c\u0634\u06a9 \u062c\u0646\u06af \u0628\u0633\u06cc\u0627\u0631 \u0627\u0628\u0644\u0647\u0627\u0646\u0647 \u0627\u0633\u062a\u060c \u0627\u0645\u0627 \u0627\u06cc\u0646 \u0646\u06a9\u062a\u0647 \u0645\u0627\u0646\u0639 \u0627\u062f\u0627\u0645\u0647 \u06cc\u0627\u0641\u062a\u0646 \u0622\u0646 \u0646\u0645\u06cc\u200c\u0634\u0648\u062f.","For by giving it some hard thought, by considering the whole thing calmly, I could see that the trouble with the guillotine was that you had no chance at all, absolutely none. The fact was that it had been decided once and for all that the patient was to die. It was an open-and-shut case, a fixed arrangement, a tacit agreement that there was no question of going back on. If by some extraordinary chance the blade failed, they would just start over. So the thing that bothered me most was that the condemned man had to hope the machine would work the first time. And I say that\'s wrong. And in a way I was right. But in another way I was forced to admit that that was the whole secret of good organization. In other words, the condemned man was forced into a kind of moral collaboration. It was in his interest that everything go off without a hitch.","Nothing is harder to understand than a symbolic work. A symbol always transcends the one who makes use of it and makes him say in reality more than he is aware of expressing.","Likewise, if Kafka wants to express the absurd, he will make use of consistency. You know the story of the crazy man who was fishing in a bathtub. A doctor with ideas as to psychiatric treatments asked him \'if they were biting\', to which he received the harsh reply: \'Of course not, you fool, since this is a bathtub.\' That story belongs to the baroque type. But in it can be grasped quite clearly to what a degree the absurd effect is linked to an excess of logic. Kafka\'s world is in truth an indescribable universe in which man allows himself the tormenting luxury of fishing in a bathtub, knowing that nothing can come of it.","I have never seen anyone die for the ontological argument.","there are truths but no truth.","From east to west, in fact, her gaze swept slowly, without encountering a single obstacle, along a perfect curve. Beneath her, the blue-and-white terraces of the Arab town overlapped one another, splattered with the dark-red spots of the peppers drying in the sun. Not a soul could be seen, but from the inner courts, together with the aroma of roasting coffee, there rose laughing voices or incomprehensible stamping of feet. Father off, the palm grove, divided into uneven squares by clay walls, rustled its upper foliage in a wind that could not be felt up on the terace. Still farther off and all the way to the horizon extended the ocher-and-gray realm of stones, in which no life was visible. At some distance from the oasis, however, near the wadi that bordered the palm grove on the west could be seen broad black tents. All around them a flock of motionless dromedaries, tiny at the distance, formed against the gray ground the black signs of a strange handwriting, the meaning of which had to be deciphered. Above the desert, the silence was as vast as the space. Janine, leaning her whole body against the parapet, was speechless, unable to tear herself away from the void opening before her. Beside her, Marcel was getting restless. He was cold; he wanted to go back down. What was there to see here, after all? But she could not take her gaze from the horizon. Over yonder, still farther south, at that point where sky and earth met in a pure line - over yonder it suddenly seemed there was awaiting her something of which, though it had always been lacking, she had never been aware until now. In the advancing afternoon the light relaxed and softened; it was passing from the crystalline to the liquid. Simultaneously, in the heart of a woman brought there by pure chance a knot tightened by the years, habit, and boredom was slowly loosening. She was looking at the nomads\' encampment. She had not even seen the men living in it\' nothing was stirring among the black tents, and yet she could think only of them whose existence she had barely known until this day. Homeless, cut off from the world, they were a handful wandering over the vast territory she could see, which however was but a paltry part of an even greater expanse whose dizzying course stopped only thousands of miles farther south, where the first river finally waters the forest. Since the beginning of time, on the dry earth of this limitless land scraped to bone, a few men had been ceaselessly trudging, possessing nothing but serving no one, poverty-stricken but free lords of a strange kingdom. Janine did not know why this thought filled her with such a sweet, vast melancholy that it closed her eyes. She knew that this kingdom had been eternally promised her and yet that it would never be hers, never again, except in this fleeting moment perhaps when she opened her eyes again on the suddenly motionless sky and on its waves of steady light, while the voices rising from the Arab town suddenly fell silent. It seemed to her that the world\'s course had just stopped and that, from that moment on, no one would ever age any more or die. Everywhere, henceforth, life was suspended - except in her heart, where, at the same moment, someone was weeping with affliction and wonder.","Anyway it was an idea of mother\'s and she often used to repeat it, that you ended up getting used to everything.","I hadn\'t grasped how days could be at once long and short. Long, no doubt, as periods to live through, but so distended that they ended up by overlapping on each other. In fact, I never thought of days as such; only the words \'yesterday\' and \'tomorrow\' still kept some meaning.","They went on living in poverty, though they were no longer in need, but they were set in their ways, and they looked on life with a resigned suspicion; they loved it as animals do, but they knew from experience that it would regularly give birth to disaster without even showing any sign that it was carrying it.","Daru felt a sudden wrath against the man, against all men with their rotten spite, their tireless hates, their blood lust.","I cannot stand the company of men. They flatter or they judge. I can stand neither of the two.","I shall tell you a great secret, my friend.

It is the difference between the Christian and the Greek. Nietzsche,at least, foresaw what was going to happen: \\"Modern socialism tends to create a form of secularJesuitism, to make instruments of all men\\"; and again: \\"What we desire is well-being. ... As a result wemarch toward a spiritual slavery such as has never been seen. . . . Intellectual Caesarism hovers overevery activity of the businessman and the philosopher.\\" Placed in the crucible of Nietzschean philosophy,rebellion, in the intoxication of freedom, ends in biological or historical Caesarism. The absolute negative had driven Stirner to deify crime simultaneously with the individual. But the absolute affirmative leads touniversalizing murder and mankind simultaneously. Marxism-Leninism has really accepted the burdenof Nietzsche\'s freewill by means of ignoring several Nietzschean virtues. The great rebel thus creates withhis own hands, and for his own imprisonment, the implacable reign of necessity. Once he had escapedfrom God\'s prison, his first care was to construct the prison of history and of reason, thus putting thefinishing touch to the camouflage and consecration of the nihilism whose conquest he claimed.","Je r\xeave parfois de ce que diront de nous les historiens futurs.

And in that huge rectangular box with its entire side open to the sea, the poor young people of the neighborhood dance until evening. Often I used to await there a a moment of exceptional beauty. During the day the hall is protected by sloping wooden awnings. When the sun goes down they are raised. Then the hall is filled with an odd green light born of the double shell of the sky and the sea. When one is seated far from the windows, one sees only the sky and, silhouetted against it, the faces of the dancers passing in succession. Sometimes a waltz is being played, and against the green background the black profiles whirl obstinately like those cut-out silhouettes that are attached to a phonograph\'s turntable. Night comes rapidly after this, and with it the lights. But I am unable to relate the thrill and secrecy that subtle instant holds for me. I recall at least a magnificent tall girl who had danced all afternoon. She was wearing a jasmine garland on her right blue dress, wet with perspiration from the small of her back to her legs. She was laughing as she danced and throwing back her head. As she passed the tables, she left behind her a mingled scent of flowers and flesh. When evening came, I could no longer see her body pressed tight to her partner, but against her body alternating spots of white jasmine and black hair, and when she would throw back her swelling breast I would hear her laugh and see her partner\'s profile suddenly plunge forward. I owe to such evenings the idea I have of innocence. In any case, I learn not to separate these creatures bursting with violent energy from the sky where their desires whirl.","En quelque sorte, on avait l\u2019air de traiter cette affaire en dehors de moi.

The latter is only really born at the momentwhen he becomes aware of himself as a rational being. Therefore his essential characteristic is selfconsciousness.","[Man is] incapable of suffering for a long time, or being happy for a long time. Which means that he\u2019s incapable of anything really worth while.","And those they love have forgotten them because all their energies are devoted to making schemes and taking steps to get them out of the camp. And by dint of always thinking about these schemes and steps they have ceased thinking about those whose release they\u2019re trying to secure. And that, too, is natural enough. In fact, it comes to this: nobody is capable of really thinking about anyone, even in the worst calamity. For really to think about someone means thinking about that person every minute of the day, without letting one\u2019s thoughts be diverted by anything - by meals, by a fly that settles on one\u2019s cheek, by household duties, or by a sudden itch somewhere.

Otherwise, were there but one lie hidden in life, death made it definitive.

At the heart of this primordial struggle for recognition, man is thus identified with violent death.The mystic slogan \\"Die and become what you are\\" is taken up once more by Hegel. But \\"Become whatyou are\\" gives place to \\"Become what you so far are not.\\" This primitive and passionate desire forrecognition, which is confused with the will to exist, can be satisfied only by a recognition graduallyextended until it embraces everyone. In that everyone wants equally much to be recognized by everyone,the fight for life will cease only with the recognition of all by all, which will mark the termination ofhistory. The existence that Hegelian consciousness seeks to obtain is born in the hard-won glory ofcollective approval.","Then there was the church and the villagers on the sidewalks, the red geraniums on the graves in the cemetery, Perez fainting (he crumpled over like a rag doll), the blood-red earth spilling over Maman\'s casket, the white flesh of the roots mixed in with it, more people, voices, the village, waiting in front of a cafe, the incessant drone of the motor, and my joy when the bus entered the nest of lights that was Algiers and I knew I was going to go to bed and sleep for twelve hours.","Above all, she loved being loved, and he had flooded her with attentions.

All that was left was this anguished heart, eager to live, rebelling against the deadly order of the world that had been with him for forty years, and still struggling against the wall that separated him from the secret of all life, wanting to go farther, to go beyond, and to discover, discover before dying, discover at least in order to be, just once to be, for a single second, but forever.","Tout le monde ment.

Proclaiming his hatred of the gods and his love of mankind, he turnsaway from Zeus with scorn and approaches mortal men in order to lead them in an assault against the heavens. Butmen are weak and cowardly; they must be organized. They love pleasure and immediate happiness; they must betaught to refuse, in order to grow up, immediate rewards. Thus Prometheus, in his turn, becomes a master who firstteaches and then commands. Men doubt that they can safely attack the city of light and are even uncertain whetherthe city exists. They must be saved from themselves. The hero then tells them that he, and he alone, knows the city.Those who doubt his word will bethrown into the desert, chained to a rock, offered to the vultures. The others will march henceforth indarkness, behind the pensive and solitary master. Prometheus alone has become god and reigns over thesolitude of men. But from Zeus he has gained only solitude and cruelty; he is no longer Prometheus, he isCaesar. The real, the eternal Prometheus has now assumed the aspect of one of his victims. The same cry,springing from the depths of the past, rings forever through the Scythian desert.","Estoy harto de la gente que muere por una idea.

It is a constant confrontation between man and his own obscurity. It is an insistence upon an impossible transparency. It challenges the world anew every second. Just as danger provided man the unique opportunity of seizing awareness, so metaphysical revolt extends awareness to the whole of experience. It is that constant presence of man in his own eyes. It is not aspiration, for it is devoid of hope. That revolt is the certainty of a crushing fate, without the resignation that ought to accompany it.","He had loved is mother and his child, everything that it was not up to him to choose.

For the rest, for everything he had to choose, he made himself love, which is not the same thing. No doubt he had known the feeling of wonderment, passion, and even moments of tenderness. But each moment had sent him on to other moments, each person to others, and he had loved nothing he had chosen, except what was little by little imposed on him by circumstance, had lasted as much by accident as by intention, and finally became necessary: Jessica. The heart, the heart above all is not free. It is inevitability and the recognition of the inevitable. And he, in truth, had never wholeheartedly loved other than the inevitable. All that was left for him was to love his own death.","Moreover, most people, assuming they had not altogether abandoned religious observances, or did not combine them naively with a thoroughly immoral way of living, had replaced normal religious practice by more or less extravagant superstitions.","He had been unfair: while his imagination and vanity had given her too much importance, his pride had given her too little.","None of this fits together?

Of course history records other philosophies that have been misconstrued and betrayed. But up to the time of Nietzsche and NationalSocialism, it was quite without parallel that a process of thought\u2014brilliantly illuminated by the nobility and by the sufferings of an exceptional mind\u2014should have been demonstrated to the eyes of the world by a parade of lies and by the hideous accumulation of corpses in concentration camps. The doctrine of the superman led to the methodical creation of sub-men\u2014a fact that doubtless should be denounced, butwhich also demands interpretation. If the final result of the great movement of rebellion in the nineteenthand twentieth centuries was to be this ruthless bondage, then surely rebellion should be rejected andNietzsche\'s desperate cry to his contemporaries taken up: \\"My conscience and yours are no longer thesame conscience.","People, who suffer from sadness and suddenly become happy, betray themselves: they stick to happiness, as if to hug, and strangle it out of jealousy.","It happens that the stage sets collapse.

Thus he implicitly brings into play a standard of values so far from beinggratuitous that he is prepared to support it no matter what the risks. Up to this point he has at leastremained silent and has abandoned himself to the form of despair in which a condition is accepted eventhough it is considered unjust. To remain silent is to give the impression that one has no opinions, that onewants nothing, and in certain cases it really amounts to wanting nothing. Despair, like the absurd, hasopinions and desires about everything in general and nothing in particular. Silence expresses this attitudevery well. But from the moment that the rebel finds his voice\u2014even though he says nothing but \\"no\\"\u2014hebegins to desire and to judge. The rebel, in the etymological sense, does a complete turnabout.

Or yesterday maybe, I don\'t know.","Awareness, no matter how confused it may be, develops from every act of rebellion: the sudden, dazzlingperception that there is something in man with which he can identify himself, even if only for a moment.Up to now this identification was never really experienced. Before he rebelled, the slave accepted all thedemands made upon him. Very often he even took orders, without reacting against them, which were farmore conducive to insurrection than the one at which he balks. He accepted them patiently, though hemay have protested inwardly, but in that he remained silent he was more concerned with his ownimmediate interests than as yet aware of his own rights. But with loss of patience\u2014with impatience\u2014areaction begins which can extend to everything that he previously accepted, and which is almost alwaysretroactive. The very moment the slave refuses to obey the humiliating orders of his master, hesimultaneously rejects the condition of slavery. The act of rebellion carries him far beyond the point hehad reached by simply refusing. He exceeds the bounds that he fixed for his antagonist, and now demandsto be treated as an equal. What was at firstthe man\'s obstinate resistance now becomes the whole man, who is identified with and summed up in thisresistance. The part of himself that he wanted to be respected he proceeds to place above everything elseand proclaims it preferable to everything, even to life itself. It becomes for him the supreme good. Havingup to now been willing to compromise, the slave suddenly adopts (\\"because this is how it must be . . .\\")an attitude of All or Nothing. With rebellion, awareness is born.","A story is neverreally moving and successful without the imperturbable continuity which is never part of real life, butwhich is to be found on the borderland between reality and reverie. If Gobineau himself had gone to Vilnahe would have got bored and come back, or would have settled down comfortably. But Casimir neverexperienced any desire to change nor did he ever wake cured of his love. He went to the bitter end, likeHeathcliff, who wanted to go beyond death in order to reach the very depths of hell.Here we have an imaginary world, therefore, which is created by the rectification of the actual world\u2014aworld where suffering can, if it wishes, continue until death, where passions are never distracted, wherepeople are prey to obsessions and are always present to one another. Man is finally able to give himselfthe alleviating form and limits which he pursues in vain in his own life. The novel creates destiny to suitany eventuality. In this way it competes with creation and, provisionally, conquers death.","The primordial sea indefatigably repeats the same words and casts up the same astonished beings on the same seashore. But at least he who consents to his own return and to the return of all things, who becomes an echo and an exalted echo, participates in thedivinity of the world.","He should rectify in creation everything that can be rectified.

The body\u2019s judgement is as good as the mind\u2019s and the body shrinks from annihilation. We get into the habit of living before acquiring the habit of thinking.

But it is so solely by virtue of the disproportion between his intention and the reality he will encounter, of the contradiction I notice between his true strength and the aim he has in view. Likewise we shall deem a verdict absurd when we contrast it with the verdict the facts apparently dictated. And, similarly, a demonstration by the absurd is achieved by comparing the consequences of such a reasoning with the logical reality one wants to set up. In all these cases, from the simplest to the most complex, the magnitude of the absurdity will be in direct ratio to the distance between the two terms of my comparison. There are absurd marriages, challenges, rancors, silences, wars, and even peace treaties. For each of them the absurdity springs from a comparison. I am thus justified in saying that the feeling of absurdity does not spring from the mere scrutiny of a fact or an impression, but that it bursts from the comparison between a bare fact and a certain reality, between an action and the world that transcends it.","The act of love, for instance, is a confession.","The people are under arms tonight because they hope for justice for tomorrow, Some go about saying that it is not worthwhile\u2026But this is because they vaguely sense that this insurrection threatens many things thar would continue to stand if all took place otherwise.","Charm is a way of getting the answer \'Yes\', without asking a clear question.","[\u062e\u0637\u0627\u0628 \u0628\u0647 \u0627\u0639\u062f\u0627\u0645\u06cc \u0642\u0628\u0644 \u0627\u0632 \u0627\u0639\u062f\u0627\u0645]\u06af\u0641\u062a: \xab\u0645\u0633\u0644\u0645\u0627! \u0627\u0645\u0627 \u0627\u06af\u0631 \u0634\u0645\u0627 \u0632\u0648\u062f\u062a\u0631 \u0646\u0645\u06cc\u0631\u06cc\u062f\u060c \u062f\u06cc\u0631\u062a\u0631 \u06a9\u0647 \u062e\u0648\u0627\u0647\u06cc\u062f \u0645\u0631\u062f. \u0622\u0646 \u0648\u0642\u062a \u0628\u0627\u0632 \u0647\u0645 \u0647\u0645\u06cc\u0646 \u0645\u0633\u0626\u0644\u0647 \u067e\u06cc\u0634 \u0631\u0648\u06cc \u0634\u0645\u0627 \u0642\u0631\u0627\u0631 \u062e\u0648\u0627\u0647\u062f \u06af\u0631\u0641\u062a. \u0686\u06af\u0648\u0646\u0647 \u0627\u06cc\u0646 \u0622\u0632\u0645\u0627\u06cc\u0634 \u0633\u062e\u062a \u0631\u0627 \u062a\u062d\u0645\u0644 \u062e\u0648\u0627\u0647\u06cc\u062f \u06a9\u0631\u062f\u061f\xbb","crois-tu que deux hommes dont l\'\xe2me et la fiert\xe9 sont \xe9gales peuvent, au moins une fois dans leur vie, se par-ler de tout leur coeur - comme s\'ils \xe9taient nus l\'un devant l\'autre, d\xe9pouill\xe9s des pr\xe9jug\xe9s, des int\xe9r\xeats particuliers et des mensonges dont ils vivent ?","The peculiar vanity of man, who wants to believe and who wants other people to believe that he is seeking after truth, when in fact it is love that he is asking the world to give him.","When I look at my life and at the secret color which it has, I feel as if tears were trembling in my heart. I am just as much the lips that I have kissed as the nights spent in the \'House before the World,\' just as much the child brought up in poverty as this frenzied ambition and thirst for life which sometimes carry me away.","In the midst of winter, I found there was, within me, an invincible summer.","The only picture of Tarrou he would always have would be the picture of a man who firmly gripped the steering-wheel of his car when driving, or else the picture of that stalwart body, now lying motionless. Knowing meant that: a living warmth, and a picture of death.","I know positively\u2026 that each of us has the plague within him; no one, no one on earth, is free from it. And I know, too, that we must keep endless watch on ourselves lest in a careless moment we breathe in somebody\u2019s face and fasten the infection on him. What\u2019s natural is the microbe. All the rest \u2013 health, integrity, purity (if you like) \u2013 is a product of the human will, of a vigilance that must never falter. The good man, the man who infects hardly anyone, is the man who has the fewest lapses of attention. And it needs tremendous will power, a never ending tension of the mind, to avoid such lapses. Yes\u2026 it\u2019s a wearying business, being plague-stricken. But it\u2019s still more wearying to refuse to be it. That\u2019s why everybody in the world today looks so tired; everyone is more or less sick of plague. But that is also why some of us, those who want to get the plague out of our systems, feel such desperate weariness, a weariness from which nothing remains to set us free, except death.","It\'s always useless to try to cut oneself off, even from other people\'s cruelty and stupidity. You can\'t say: \\"I don\'t know about it.\\" One either fights or collaborates. There is nothing less excusable than war, and the appeal to national hatreds. But once war has come, it is both cowardly and useless to try to stand on one side under the pretext that one is not responsible. Ivory towers are down. Indulgence is forbidden\u2014for oneself as well as for other people. It is both impossible and immoral to judge an event from outside. One keeps the right to hold this absurd misfortune in contempt only by remaining inside it. One individual\'s reaction has no intrinsic importance. It can be of some use, but I can justify nothing. Dilettante\'s dream of being free to hover above his time is the most ridiculous form of liberty. This is why I must try to serve. And, if they don\'t want me, I must also accept the position of the \\"despised civilian.\\" In both cases, I am absolutely free to judge things and to feel as disgusted with them as I like. In both cases, I am in the midst of the war and have the right to judge it. To judge it and to act","Who, despite the pretensions of this society,can sleep in it in peace when they know that it derives its mediocre pleasures from the work of millions ofdead souls?","\u2013 Recite, Taru, da li ste sposobni da \u017ertvujete \u017eivot za ljubav?\u2013 Ne znam, ali mi se \u010dini da nisam, sada.\u2013 Eto.

No, don\'t worry, they\'ll ring up the evening you are not alone, when life is beautiful.","He was one of those rare people, rare in our town as elsewhere, who have the courage of their good feelings. What little he told of his personal life vouched for acts of kindness and a capacity for affection that no one in our times dares own to.","\u2026 I suppose that it is not so easy to go home and it takes a bit of time to make a son out of a stranger.","L\'absurde na\xeet de la confrontation entre l\'appel humain et le silence d\xe9raisonnable du monde.","At a certain degree of lucid intoxication, lying late at night between two prostitutes and drained of all desire, hope ceases to be a torture, you see; the mind dominates the whole past, and the pain of living is over forever.","In this respect our townsfolk were like everybody else, wrapped up in themselves; in other words they were humanists: they disbelieved in pestilences. A pestilence isn\'t a thing made to man\'s measure; therefore we tell ourselves that pestilence is a mere bogy of the mind, a bad dream that will pass away. But it doesn\'t always pass away and, from one bad dream to another, it is men who pass away, and the humanists first of all, because they haven\'t taken their precautions. Our townsfolk were not more to blame than others; they forgot to be modest, that was all, and thought that everything still was possible for them; which presupposed that pestilences were impossible. They went on doing business, arranged for journeys, and formed views. How should they have given a thought to anything like plague, which rules out any future, cancels journeys, silences the exchange of views. They fancied themselves free, and no one will ever be free so long as there are pestilences.","The evil in the world comes almost always from ignorance,and goodwill can cause as much damage as ill-will if it is not enlightened.","Le jour finissait et c\'\xe9tait l\'heure dont je ne veux pas parler, l\'heure sans nom, o\xf9 les bruits du soir","The trouble is, there is nothing less spectacular than a pestilence and, if only because they last so long, great misfortunes are monotonous. In the memory of those who have lived through them, the dreadful days of the plague do not seem like vast flames, cruel and magnificent, but rather like an endless trampling that flattened everything in its path.","And the world has become merely an unknown landscape where my heart can lean on nothing. \u2014 Albert Camus, Notebooks 1935-1942 (Paragon House Publishers, 1991)","When the meaning of life has been suppressed, there still remains life. \\"I live,\\" says Ivan, \\"in spite of logic.\\" And again: \\"If I no longer had any faith in life, if I doubted a woman I loved, or the universal order of things, if I were persuaded, on the contrary, that everything was only an infernal and accursed chaos\u2014even then I would want to live.\\" Ivan will live,then, and will love as well \\"without knowing why.\\" But to live is also to act. To act in the name of what?If there is no immortality, then there is neither reward nor punishment. \\"I believe that there is no virtuewithout immortality.\\" And also: \\"I only know that suffering exists, that no one is guilty, that everything isconnected, that everything passes away and equals out.\\" But if there is no virtue, there is no law:\\"Everything is permitted.","Forever I shall be a stranger to myself, kupo. In psychology as in logic, there are truths but no truth.","We must mend what has been torn apart, make justice imaginable again in a world so obviously unjust, give happiness a meaning once more to peoples poisoned by the misery of the century.","Maybe, after all, it doesn\u2019t want it enough? Maybe we don\u2019t love life enough? Have you noticed that death alone awakens our feelings? How we love the friends who have just left us? How we admire those of our teachers who have ceased to speak, their mouths filled with earth! Then the expression of admiration springs forth naturally, that admiration they were perhaps expecting from us all their lives.","I wasn\'t even able to tell myself that it was hard to think those things.","As he himself said, \\"I will prove it to you, gentlemen, and i will prove it in two ways. First in the blinding clarity of the facts, and second, in the dim light cast by the mind of his criminal soul.","But the heart has its own memory and I have forgotten nothing","The papers were always talking about the debt owed to society. According to them, it had to be paid . But that doesn\'t speak to the imagination. What really counted was the possibility of escape, a leap to freedom, out of the implacable ritual, a wild run for it that would give whatever chance for hope there was...Despite my willingness to understand, I just couldn\'t accept such arrogant certainty. Because, after all, there really was something ridiculously out of proportion between the verdict such certainty was based on and the imperturbable march of events from the moment the verdict was announced...How had I not seen that there was nothing more important than an execution, and that when you come right down to it, it was the only thing a man could truly be interested in? If I ever got out of this prison I would go and watch every execution there was. But I think it was a mistake even to consider the possibility...But I wasn\'t being reasonable. It was a mistake to let myself get carried away by such imaginings, because the next minute I would get so cold that I would curl up into a ball under my blanket and my teeth would be chattering and I couldn\'t make them stop...So the thing that bothered me most was that the condemned man had to hope the machine would work the first time. And I say that\u2019s wrong . And in a way I was right. But in another way I was forced to admit that that was the whole secret of good organization. In other words, the condemned man was forced into a kind of moral collaboration. It was in his interest that everything go off without a hitch.","Through style, the creative effort reconstructs the world, and always with the same slightdistortion that is the mark of both art and protest. Whether it is the enlargement of the microscope whichProust brings to bear on human experience or, on the contrary, the absurd insignificance with which theAmerican novel endows its characters, reality is in some way artificial. The creative force, the fecundityof rebellion, are contained in this distortion which the style and tone of a work represent. Art is animpossible demand given expression and form. When the most agonizing protest finds its most resoluteform of expression, rebellion satisfies its real aspirations and derives creative energy from this fidelity toitself. Despite the fact that this runs counter to the prejudices of the times, the greatest style in art is theexpression of the most passionate rebellion. Just as genuine classicism is only romanticism subdued,genius is a rebellion that has created its own limits. That is why there is no genius, contrary to what weare taught today, in negation and pure despair.","The protest against evil which is at the very core of metaphysical revolt is significant in this regard. It is not thesuffering of a child, which is repugnant in itself, but the fact that the suffering is not justified. After all, pain, exile,or confinement are sometimes accepted when dictated by good sense or by the doctor. In the eyes of the rebel, whatis missing from the misery of the world, as well as from its moments of happiness, is some principle by which theycan be explained. The insurrection against evil is, above all, a demand for unity. The rebel obstinately confronts aworld condemned to death and the impenetrable obscurity of the human condition with his demand for life andabsolute clarity. He is seeking, without knowing it, a moral philosophy or a religion. Rebellion, even though it isblind, is a form of asceticism. Therefore, if the rebel blasphemes, it is in the hope of finding a new god. He staggersunder the shock of the first and most profound of all religious experiences, but it is a disenchanted religiousexperience. It is not rebellion itself that is noble, but its aims, even though its achievements are at times ignoble.","When I was first imprisoned, the hardest thing was that my thoughts were still those of a free man.","Je dis seulement qu\'il y a sur cette terre des fl\xe9aux et des victimes et qu\'il faut, autant qu\'il est possible, refuser d\'\xeare avec le fl\xe9au. Cela vous para\xeera peut-\xeatre un peu simple, et je ne sais si cela est simple, mais je sais que cela est vrai.","The appalling society of tyrants and slaves inwhich we survive will find its death and transfiguration only on the level of creation.","The final conclusion of absurdist reasoning is, in fact, the repudiation of suicide and the acceptance of the desperate encounter between human inquiry and the silence of the universe. Suicide would mean the end of this encounter, and absurdist reasoning considers that it could not consent to this without negating its own premises.","In the middle of the night, through the whole of the rest of the summer and beneath the autumn, one could see strange convoys of trams without passengers proceeding down the front, rattling along above the sea. Eventually, the people discovered what was going on; and despite patrols preventing anyone from reaching the promenade, some groups did quite often manage to get among the rocks right above the sea and throw flowers into the carriages as soon as the trams went past. One could hear the vehicles still bumping along on a summer\'s night, laden with flowers and corpses.","All normal people -I added as on afterthought- had more or less desired the death of those they loved, at some time or another.","Ernst Dwinger in his Siberian Diarymentions a German lieutenant\u2014for years a prisoner in a camp where cold and hunger were almostunbearable\u2014who constructed himself a silent piano with wooden keys.

It is a movement thatdescribes a complete circle, that leads from one form of government to another after a complete transition.A change of regulations concerning property without a corresponding change of government is not arevolution, but a reform. There is no kind of economic revolution, whether its methods are violent orpacific, which is not, at the same time, manifestly political. Revolution can already be distinguished, inthis way, from rebellion. The warning given to Louis XVI: \\"No, sire, this is not a rebellion, it is arevolution,\\" accents the essential difference. It means precisely that \\"it is the absolute certainty of a newform of government.\\" Rebellion is, by nature, limited in scope. It is no more than an incoherentpronouncement. Revolution, on the contrary, originates in the realm of ideas. Specifically, it is theinjection of ideas into historical experience, while rebellion is only the movement that leads fromindividual experience into the realm of ideas.","This is no longer a prayer but a demand to be made by all peoples to their governments\u2014a demand to choose definitively between hell and reason.","But, after all, I was on the right side; that was enough to satisfy my conscience.

Which is stupid, which is false, and to a certain degree cowardly. You see, Mersault, for a man who is well born, being happy is never complicated. It\'s enough to take up the general fate, only not with the will for renunciation like so many fake great men, but with the will for happiness. Only it takes time to be happy. A lot of time.

But its blind impulse is todemand order in the midst of chaos, and unity in the very heart of the ephemeral. It protests, it demands, itinsists that the outrage be brought to an end, and that what has up to now been built upon shifting sandsshould henceforth be founded on rock. Its preoccupation is to transform. But to transform is to act, and toact will be, tomorrow, to kill, and it still does not know whether murder is legitimate.

To feel it so like myself, indeed, so brotherly, made me realize that I\'d been happy, and that I was happy still.","Seeking what is true is not seeking what is desirable. If in order to elude the anxious question: \u201cWhat would life be? one must, like the donkey, feed on the roses of illusion, then the absurd mind, rather than resigning itself to falsehood, prefers to adopt fearlessly Kierkegaard\u2019s reply: \u201cdespair.\u201d Everything considered, a determined soul will always manage.\u201d","In raining bullets on those silent faces, already turned away from this world, you think you are disfiguring the face of our truth.","No se vive m\xe1s o menos largamente feliz.

Janine could not tear herself away from the contemplation of these shifting fires. She turned with them, and the same stationary progression reunited her little by little with her deepest being, where cold and desire now collided.

The difference is that evil is no longer a revenge. It is accepted as one of the possible aspects of good and, with rather moreconviction, as part of destiny.

A symbol always transcends the one who makes use of it and makes him say in reality more than he is aware of expressing.","Perhaps the easiest way of making a town\u2019s acquaintance is to ascertain how the people in it work, how they love, and how they die.","Los que escriben con claridad tienen lectores, los que escriben oscuramente tienen comentaristas","The world always says the same thing.

I would measure the years separating me from my end. I would look for examples of men of my age who were already dead. And I was tormented by the thought that I might not have time to accomplish my task. What task? I had no idea.

Not a sound came from it; wisps of smoke rose in the limpid air. The sea also lay silent, as if breathless beneath the unending shower of cold, glittering light. From the Chenoua, a distant cock crow alone sang the fragile glory of the day. Across the ruins, as far as one could see, there were nothing but pitted stones and absinthe plants, trees and perfect columns in the transparence of the crystal air. It was as if the morning stood still, as if the sun had stopped for an immeasurable moment. In this light and silence, years of night and fury melted slowly away. I listened to an almost forgotten sound within myself, as if my heart had long been stopped and was now gently beginning to beat again.","And the more I thought about it, the more I dug ut of memory things I had overlooked or forgotten. I realized then that a man who had lived only a day could easily live for a hundred years in prison. He would have enough memories to keep him from being bored.","What does eternity matter to me?

One must imagine Sisyphus happy.","So I learned that after a single day\'s experience of the outside world a man could easily live a hundred years in prison.","Our feminine friends have in common with Bonaparte the belief that they can succeed where everyone else has failed.","To be really realistic a description wouldhave to be endless. Where Stendhal describes in one phrase Lucien Leuwen\'s entrance into a room, therealistic artist ought, logically, to fill several volumes with descriptions of characters and settings, stillwithout succeeding in exhausting every detail. Realism is indefinite enumeration. By this it reveals that itsreal ambition is conquest, not of the unity, but of the totality of the real world. Now we understand why itshould be the official aesthetic of a totalitarian revolution. But the impossibility of such an aesthetic hasalready been demonstrated. Realistic novels select their material, despite themselves, from reality,because the choice and the conquest of reality are absolute conditions of thought and expression. Towrite is already to choose. There is thus an arbitrary aspect to reality, just as there is an arbitrary aspect tothe ideal, which makes a realistic novel an implicit problem novel. To reduce the unity of the world offiction to the totality of reality can only be done by means of an a priori judgment which eliminates form,reality, and everything that conflicts with doctrine. Therefore so-called socialist realism is condemned bythe very logic of its nihilism to accumulate the advantages of the edifying novel and propagandaliterature.","There is more in Man to admire than there is to despise.","Nothing mattered, and I knew why.

Ces cinq mille francs, arriv\xe9s \xe0 la fin d\u2019une vie, se r\xe9v\xe9l\xe8rent assez encombrants. Il fallait les placer. Si presque tous les hommes sont capables de se servir d\u2019une grosse fortune, la difficult\xe9 commence quand la somme est petite. Cette femme resta fid\xe8le \xe0 elle-m\xeame. Pr\xe8s de la mort, elle voulut abriter ses vieux os. Une v\xe9ritable occasion s\u2019offrait \xe0 elle. Au cimeti\xe8re de sa ville, une concession venait d\u2019expirer et, sur ce terrain, les propri\xe9taires avaient \xe9rig\xe9 un somptueux caveau, sobre de lignes, en marbre noir, un vrai tr\xe9sor \xe0 tout dire, qu\u2019on lui laissait pourla somme de quatre mille francs. Elle acheta ce caveau. C\u2019\xe9tait l\xe0 une valeur s\xfbre, \xe0 l\u2019abri des fluctuations boursi\xe8res et des \xe9v\xe9nements politiques. Elle fit am\xe9nager la fosse int\xe9rieure, la tint pr\xeate \xe0 recevoir son propre corps. Et, tout achev\xe9, elle fit graver son nom en capitales d\u2019or.Cette affaire la contenta si profond\xe9ment qu\u2019elle fut prise d\u2019un v\xe9ritable amour pour son tombeau. Elle venait voir au d\xe9but les progr\xe8s des travaux Elle finit par se rendre visite tous les dimanches apr\xe8s-midi. Ce fut son unique sortie et sa seule distraction. Vers deux heures de l\u2019apr\xe8s-midi, elle faisait le long trajet qui l\u2019amenait aux portes de la ville o\xf9 se trouvait le cimeti\xe8re. Elle entrait dans le petit caveau, refermait soigneusement la porte, et s\u2019agenouillait sur le prie-Dieu. C\u2019est ainsi que, mise en pr\xe9sence d\u2019elle-m\xeame, confrontant ce qu\u2019elle \xe9tait et ce qu\u2019elle devait \xeatre, retrouvant l\u2019anneau d\u2019une cha\xeene toujours rompue, elle per\xe7a sans effort les desseins secrets de la Providence.

But perhaps someday, when we are ready to die of exhaustion and ignorance, I shall be able to disown our garish tombs and go and stretch out in the valley, under the same light, and learn for the last time what I know.","Industrial society will open the way to a new civilization only by restoring to the worker thedignity of a creator; in other words, by making him apply his interest and his intelligence as much to thework itself as to what it produces. The type of civilization that is inevitable will not be ableto separate, among classes as well as among individuals, the worker from the creator; any more thanartistic creation dreams of separating form and substance, history and the mind. In this way it will bestowon everyone the dignity that rebellion affirms. It would be unjust, and moreover Utopian, for Shakespeareto direct the shoemakers\' union. But it would be equally disastrous for the shoemakers\' union to ignoreShakespeare. Shakespeare without the shoemaker serves as an excuse for tyranny. The shoemaker withoutShakespeare is absorbed by tyranny when he does not contribute to its propagation. Every act of creation,by its mere existence, denies the world of master and slave. The appalling society of tyrants and slaves inwhich we survive will find its death and transfiguration only on the level of creation.","I, on the contrary, chose justice in order to remain faithful to the world.

Tall and thin he seemed lost in the garments that the always chose a size too large, under the illusion that they would wear longer. Though he still had most of the teeth in his lower jaw, all the upper ones were gone, with the result that when he smiled, raising his upper lip - the lower scarcely moved - his mouth looked like a small black hole let into his face. Also he had the walk of a shy young priest, sidling along walls and slipping mouselike into doorways, and he exuded a faint odor of smoke and basement rooms; in short, he had all the attributes of insignificance. Indeed, it cost an effort to picture him otherwise than bent over a desk, studiously revising the tariff of the town baths or gathering for a junior secretary the materials of a report on the new garbage-collection tax. Even before you knew what his employment was, you had a feeling that he\'d been brought into the world for the sole purpose of performing the discreet but needful duties of a temporary assistant municipal clerk on a salary of sixty-two francs, thirty centimes a day.","Living is keeping the absurd alive.","they were in a rather odd state of mind where, without having fully accepted in themselves the surprising events in which they were caught up, they did obviously believe that something had changed.

And it is the consequences of nihilism that we must retrace, without losing sight of the truth innate inits origins. Even if God existed, Ivan would never surrender to Him in the face of the injustice done to man. But alonger contemplation of this injustice, a more bitter approach, transformed the \\"even if you exist\\" into \\"you do notdeserve to exist,\\" therefore \\"you do not exist.\\" The victims have found in their own innocence the justification forthe final crime. Convinced of their condemnation and without hope of immortality, they decided to murder God. If itis false to say that from that day began the tragedy of contemporary man, neither is it true to say that there waswhere it ended. On the contrary, this attempt indicates the highest point in a drama that began with the end of theancient world and of which the final words have not yet been spoken. From this moment, man decides to excludehimself from grace and to live by his own means. Progress, from the time of Sade up to the present day, hasconsisted in gradually enlarging the stronghold where, according to his own rules, man without God brutally wieldspower. In defiance of the divinity, the frontiers of this stronghold have been gradually extended, to the point ofmaking the entire universe into a fortress erected against the fallen and exiled deity. Man, at the culmination of hisrebellion, incarcerated himself; from Sade\'s lurid castleto the concentration camps, man\'s greatest liberty consisted only in building the prison of his crimes. But the state ofsiege gradually spreads, the demand for freedom wants to embrace all mankind. Then the only kingdom that isopposed to the kingdom of grace must be founded \u2014namely, the kingdom of justice\u2014and the human communitymust be reunited among the debris of the fallen City of God. To kill God and to build a Church are the constant andcontradictory purpose of rebellion. Absolute freedom finally becomes a prison of absolute duties, a collectiveasceticism, a story to be brought to an end. The nineteenth century, which is the century of rebellion, thus mergesinto the twentieth, the century of justice and ethics, in which everyone indulges in self-recrimination.","Tekerlekler \xfczerinde kayan zindan\u0131m\u0131n karanl\u0131\u011f\u0131nda, yorgunlu\u011fun ta derinliklerinden geli\u015fmi\u015f\xe7esine, sevdi\u011fim bir kenti, kendimi mutlu hissetti\u011fim belli bir saatin b\xfct\xfcn bu al\u0131\u015f\u0131lm\u0131\u015f g\xfcr\xfclt\xfclerini eskisi gibi, bir bir bulur gibi oldum.

The prophetic dream of Marx and the over-inspired predictions of Hegel or ofNietzsche ended by conjuring up, after the city of God had been razed to the ground, a rational orirrational State, which in both cases, however, was founded on terror.In actual fact, the Fascist revolutions of the twentieth century do not merit the title of revolution. Theylacked the ambition of universality. Mussolini and Hitler, of course, tried to build an empire, and theNational Socialist ideologists were bent, explicitly, on world domination. But the difference betweenthem and the classic revolutionary movement is that, of the nihilist inheritance, they chose to deify theirrational, and the irrational alone, insteadof deifying reason. In this way they renounced their claim to universality. And yet Mussolini makesuse of Hegel, and Hitler of Nietzsche; and both illustrate, historically, some of the prophecies of Germanideology. In this respect they belong to the history of rebellion and of nihilism. They were the first toconstruct a State on the concept that everything is meaningless and that history is only written in terms ofthe hazards of force. The consequences were not long in appearing.","I like the night and the sky better than the gods of men.","It is almost impossible to watch a clockwise direction - it gets extremely boring and causes despair.","Fais servir alors ton pouvoir \xe0 mieux aimer ce qui peut l\'\xeatre encore.","Every day, soon after lunch, at a time when most people stayed indoors, enjoying a siesta, a dapper little old man stepped out on the balcony on the other side of the street.

It is the limit that can be reachedbut once, after which one must die. The rebel has only one way of reconciling himself with his act ofmurder if he allows himself to be led into performing it: to accept his own death and sacrifice.

I should not be worthy to love the bare and empty beaches if I could not remain naked in the presence of myself.

It is a little different from what men normally mean when they say: \'i am happy.","Yet all the knowledge on earth will give me nothing to assure me that this world is mine. You describe it to me and you teach me to classify it. You enumerate its laws and in my thirst for knowledge I admit that they are true. You take apart its mechanism and my hope increases.

But, on the other hand, in a universe suddenly divested of illusions and lights, man feels an alien, a stranger. His exile is without remedy since he is deprived of the memory of a lost home or the hope of a promised land. This divorce between man and his life, the actor and his setting, is properly the feeling of absurdity.","But to kill men leads to nothing but killing more men. For one principle to triumph, another principle must be overthrown. The city of light of which Spartacus dreamed could only have been built on the ruins of eternal Rome, of its institutions and of its gods. Spartacus\u2019 army marches to lay siege to a Rome paralyzed with fear at the prospect of having to pay for its crimes. At the decisive moment, however, within sight of the sacred walls, the army halts and wavers, as if it were retreating before the principles, the institutions, the city of the gods. When these had been destroyed, what could be put in their place except the brutal desire for justice, the wounded and exacerbated love that until this moment had kept these wretches on their feet.2 In any case, the army retreated without having fought, and then made the curious move of deciding to return to the place where the slave rebellion originated, to retrace the long road of its victories and to return to Sicily. It was as though these outcasts, forever alone and helpless before the great tasks that awaited them and too daunted to assail the heavens, returned to what was purest and most heartening in their history, to the land of their first awakening, where it was easy and right to die.Then began their defeat and martyrdom. Before the last battle, Spartacus crucified a Roman citizen to show his men the fate that was in store for them. During the battle, Spartacus himself tried with frenzied determination, the symbolism of which is obvious, to reach Crassus, who was commanding the Roman legions. He wanted to perish, but in single combat with the man who symbolized, at that moment, every Roman master; it was his dearest wish to die, but in absolute equality. He did not reach Crassus: principles wage war at a distance and the Roman general kept himself apart. Spartacus died, as he wished, but at the hands of mercenaries, slaves like himself, who killed their own freedom with his. In revenge for the one crucified citizen, Crassus crucified thousands of slaves. The six thousand crosses which, after such a just rebellion, staked out the road from Capua to Rome demonstrated to the servile crowd that there is no equality in the world of power and that the masters calculate, at a usurious rate, the price of their own blood.","Iar dac\u0103 azi s\xeent nefericit\u0103, de\u015fi s\xeent convins\u0103 de dragostea ta, e pentru c\u0103 s\xeent sigur\u0103 c\u0103 ai s\u0103-mi spui s\u0103 plec.

He can only be sure of his own existence by finding it in the expression of others\u2019 faces. Other people are his mirror. A mirror that quickly becomes clouded, it is true, since human capacity for attention is limited. It must be ceaselessly stimulated, spurred on by provocation. The dandy, therefore, is always compelled to astonish. Singularity is his vocation, excess his way to perfection. Perpetually incomplete, always on the fringe of things, he compels others to create him, while denying their values. He plays at life because he is unable to live it. He plays at it until he dies, except for the moments when he is alone and without a mirror. For the dandy, to be alone is not to exist. The romantics talked so grandly about solitude only because it was their real horror, the one thing they could not bear.","Trezire, tramvai, patru ore de birou sau de uzin\u0103, mas\u0103, tramvai, patru ore de munc\u0103, mas\u0103, somn; \u015fi luni, mar\u0163i, miercuri, joi, vineri, s\xe2mb\u0103t\u0103, \xeen acela\u015fi ritm \u2014 iat\u0103 un drum pe care \xeel urm\u0103m cu u\u015furin\u0163\u0103 aproape tot timpul.

And then whatis the basis of morality? God is denied in the name of justice, but can the idea of justice be understoodwithout the idea of God? At this point are we not in the realm of absurdity? Absurdity is the concept thatNietzsche meets face to face.

Then God no longerexists and is no longer responsible for our existence; man must resolve to act, in order to exist.","Newspapers often speak of \u201cpersonal sorrows or of \u201cincurable illness.\u201d These explanations are plausible.

While waiting for this to happen, if happen it must, the history of man, inone sense, is the sum total of his successive rebellions. In other words, the movement of transition whichcan be clearly expressed in terms of space is only an approximation in terms of time. What was devoutlycalled, in the nineteenth century, the progressive emancipation of the human race appears, from theoutside, like an uninterrupted series of rebellions, which overreach themselves and try to find theirformulation in ideas, but which have not yet reached the point of definitive revolution where everythingin heaven and on earth would be stabilized.","Sculpture does not reject resemblance, of which, indeed, it has need. But resemblance is not its first aim.What it is looking for, in its periods of greatness, is the gesture, the expression, or the empty stare whichwill sum up all the gestures and all the stares in the world. Its purpose is not to imitate, but to stylize andto imprison in one significant expression the fleeting ecstasy of the body or the infinite variety of humanattitudes.

For by asserting that all is true we assert the truth of the contrary assertion and consequently the falsity of our own thesis (for the contrary assertion does not admit that it can be true). And if one says that all is false, that assertion is itself false. If we declare that solely the assertion opposed to ours is false or else that solely ours is not false, we are nevertheless forced to admit an infinite number of true or false judgments. For the one who expresses a true assertion proclaims simultaneously that it is true, and so on ad infinitum. This vicious circle is but the first of a series in which the mind that studies itself gets lost in a giddy whirling. The very simplicity of these paradoxes makes them irreducible. Whatever may be the plays on words and the acrobatics of logic, to understand is, above all, to unify.

Originally, at least, he does not suppress God; he merely talks to Him as an equal.But it is not a polite dialogue. It is a polemic animated by the desire to conquer. The slave begins bydemanding justice and ends by wanting to wear a crown. He must dominate in his turn. His insurrectionagainst his condition becomes an unlimited campaign against the heavens for the purpose of bringingback a captive king who will first be dethroned and finally condemned to death. Human rebellion ends inmetaphysical revolution. It progresses from appearances to acts, from the dandy to the revolutionary.When the throne of God is overturned, the rebel realizes that it is now his own responsibility to create thejustice, order, and unity that he sought in vain within his own condition, and in this way to justify the fallof God. Then begins the desperate effort to create, at the price of crime and murder if necessary, thedominion of man.","It was through this odor that he saw the museums and discovered the mystery and the profusion of baroque genius which filled Prague with its gold magnificence. The altars, which glowed softly in the darkness, seemed borrowed from the coppery sky, the misty sunlight so frequent over the city.

Seen from a distance, these existences seem to possess a coherence and a unity which they cannot have in reality, but which seem evident to the spectator. He sees only the salient points of these lives without taking into account the details of corrosion. Thus we make these lives into works of art. In an elementary fashion we turn them into novels. In this sense, everyone tries to make his life a work of art. We want love to last and we know that it does not last; even if, by some miracle, it were to last a whole lifetime, it would still be incomplete. Perhaps, in this insatiable need for perpetuation, we should better understand human suffering if we knew that it was eternal. It appears that great minds are sometimes less horrified by suffering than by the fact that it does not endure. In default of inexhaustible happiness, eternal suffering would at least give us a destiny. But we do not even have that consolation, and our worst agonies come to an end one day. One morning, after many dark nights of despair, an irrepressible longing to live will announce to us the fact that all is finished and that suffering has no more meaning than happiness.","He knew what those jubilant crowds did not know but could have learned from books: that the plague bacillus never dies or disappears for good; that it can lie dormant for years and years in furniture and linen chests; that it bides its time in bedrooms, cellars, trunks, and bookshelves; and that perhaps the day would come when, for the bane and the enlightening of men, it would rouse up its rats again and send them forth to die in a happy\xa0city.","El mundo solo dice siempre una cosa, e interesa, despu\xe9s cansa.","This land on which so many centuries have left their mark is merely an obligatory retreat for you, whereas it has always been our dearest hope.

Ofcourse, certain sources of its inspiration can be found in the seventeenth century; the quarrel between theAncients and the Moderns already introduced into European ideology the perfectly absurd conception ofan artistic form of progress. In a more serious fashion, the idea of a science that steadily increases itsconquests can also be derived from Cartesian philosophy. But Turgot, in 1750, is the first person to give aclear definition of the new faith. His treatise on the progress of the human mind basically recapitulatesBossuet\'s universal history. The idea of progress alone is substituted for the divine will. \\"The total massof the human race, by alternating stages of calm and agitation, of good and evil, always marches, thoughwith dragging footsteps, toward greater and greater perfection.\\" This optimistic statement will furnish thebasic ingredient of the rhetorical observations of Condorcet, the official theorist of progress, which helinked with the progress of the State and of which he was also the official victim in that the enlightenedState forced him to poison himself. Sorel was perfectly correct in saying that the philosophy of progresswas exactly the philosophy to suit a society eager to enjoy the material prosperity derived from technicalprogress. When we are assured that tomorrow, in the natural order of events, will be better than today, wecan enjoy ourselves in peace. Progress, paradoxically, can be used to justify conservatism.

I shouldn\'t have said, \'the way they\'re constituted\', because after all, it\'s our way, too: it\'s a case of who strips whom.","In this desert everything begins to flower again. \\"The terrifying significance of an unpremeditated cry ofjoy cannot be understood while the long night of faith and reason endures.\\" This night is drawing to aclose, and a dawn will break which is not the dawn of revolution but of insurrection. Insurrection is, initself, an asceticism which rejects all forms of consolation. The insurgent will not be in agreement withother men except in so far as, and as long as, their egotism coincides with his. His real life is led insolitude where he will assuage, without restraint, his appetite for existing, which is his only reason forexistence.In this respect individualism reaches a climax. It is the negation of everything that denies the individualand the glorification of everything that exalts and ministers to the individual. What, according to Stirner,is good? \\"Everything of which I can make use.\\" What am I, legitimately, authorized to do? \\"Everything ofwhich I am capable.\\" Once again, rebellion leads to the justification of crime. Stirner not only hasattempted to justify crime (in this respect the terrorist forms of anarchy are directly descended from him),but is visibly intoxicated by the perspectives that he thus reveals. \\"To break with what is sacred, or ratherto destroy the sacred, could become universal. It is not a new revolution that is approaching\u2014but is not apowerful, proud, disrespectful, shameless, conscienceless crime swelling like a thundercloud on thehorizon, and can you not see that the sky, heavy with foreboding, is growing dark and silent?\\" Here wecan feel the somber joy of those who create an apocalypse in a garret. This bitter and imperious logic canno longer be held in check, except by an I which is determined to defeat every form of abstraction andwhich has itself become abstract and nameless through being isolated and cut off from its roots. There areno more crimes and no more imperfections, and therefore no more sinners. We are all perfect.","Even the small satisfaction of writing letters was denied us. It came to this: not only had the town ceased to be in touch with the rest of the world by normal means of communication, but also\u2014according to a second notification\u2014all correspondence was forbidden, to obviate the risk of letters\u2019 carrying infection outside the town.","Either this stripped-down solitude or the storm of love\u2013nothing else in the world interests me.","Il y a dans les hommes plus de choses \xe0 admirer que de choses \xe0 m\xe9priser.

At the moment of supreme tension, there will leapinto flight an unswerving arrow, a shaft that is inflexible and free.","Dans l\'exp\xe9rience absurde, la souffrance est individuelle.

It does not choose feelings or passions to give a detailed description of, such as we find in classicFrench novels. It rejects analysis and the search for a fundamental psychological motive that could explain andrecapitulate the behavior of a character. This is why the unity of this novel form is only the unity of the flash ofrecognition. Its technique consists in describing men by their outside appearances, in their most casual actions, ofreproducing, without comment, everything they say down to their repetitions,and finally by acting as if men wereentirely defined by their daily automatisms. On this mechanical level men, in fact, seem exactly alike, whichexplains this peculiar universe in which all the characters appear interchangeable, even down to their physicalpeculiarities. This technique is called realistic only owing to a misapprehension. In addition to the fact that realismin art is, as we shall see, an incomprehensible idea, it is perfectly obvious that this fictitious world is not attemptinga reproduction, pure and simple, of reality, but the most arbitrary form of stylization. It is born of a mutilation, andof a voluntary mutilation, performed on reality. The unity thus obtained is a degraded unity, a leveling off of humanbeings and of the world. It would seem that for these writers it is the inner life that deprives human actions of unityand that tears people away from one another. This is a partially legitimate suspicion. But rebellion, which is one ofthe sources of the art of fiction, can find satisfaction only in constructing unity on the basis of affirming this interiorreality and not of denying it. Todeny it totally is to refer oneself to an imaginary man.","Benim kendisinden nefret etti\u011fime inanan biri, onu geni\u015f bir g\xfcl\xfcmseme ile selamlad\u0131\u011f\u0131m\u0131 g\xf6r\xfcnce ap\u0131\u015f\u0131p kal\u0131yordu.

The world, here, became a personage, counted among those from whom advice is gladly taken, those in whom equilibrium has not killed love.","The individuals under a totalitarian regime are not free, eventhough man in the collective sense is free. Finally, when the Empire delivers the entire human species,freedom will reign over herds of slaves, who at least will be free in relation to God and,in general, in relation to every kind of transcendence. The dialectic miracle, the transformation of quantityinto quality, is explained here: it is the decision to call total servitude freedom. Moreover, as in all theexamples cited by Hegel and Marx, there is no objective transformation, but only a subjective change ofdenomination. In other words, there is no miracle. If the only hope of nihilism lies in thinking thatmillions of slaves can one day constitute a humanity which will be freed forever, then history is nothingbut a desperate dream. Historical thought was to deliver man from subjection to a divinity; but thisliberation demanded of him the most absolute subjection to historical evolution. Then man takes refuge inthe permanence of the party in the same way that he formerly prostrated himself before the altar. That iswhy the era which dares to claim that it is the most rebellious that has ever existed only offers a choice ofvarious types of conformity. The real passion of the twentieth century is servitude.","There are more things in people that are rather worth of admiration than contempt.","Man does not yet obtain assurance butonly the wish for assurance, which is not at all the same thing.

My reply to this was that if you gave in once, there was no reason for not continuing to give in. It seems to me that history has borne me out; today there\u2019s a sort of competition who will kill the most. They\u2019re all mad over murder and they couldn\u2019t stop killing men even if they wanted to.","We must all know that each mediocrity, each surrender, each act of complacency will harm us as much as the enemy\'s rifles.","O my soul, do not aspire to immortal life, but exhaust the limits of the possible Pindar, Pythian iii","M\xeame sur un banc d\u2019accus\xe9, il est toujours int\xe9ressant d\u2019entendre parler de soi.

But he uses absolutely the opposite means. He upholds, above everything, by a deliberate choice, acareful selection of unique experience, which the writer chooses from the most secret recesses of his past.Immense empty spaces are thus discarded from life because they have left no trace in the memory. If theAmerican novel is the novel of men without memory, the world of Proust is nothing but memory. It isconcerned only with the most difficult and most exacting of memories, the memory that rejects thedispersion of the actual world and derives, from the trace of a lingering perfume, the secret of a new andancient universe. Proust chooses the interior life and, of the interior life, that which is more interior thanlife itself in preference to what is forgotten in the world of reality\u2014 in other words, the purely mechanicaland blind aspects of the world. But by his rejection of reality he does not deny reality. He does notcommit the error, which would counterbalance the error of American fiction, of suppressingthe mechanical. He unites, on the contrary, into a superior form of unity, the memory of the past and theimmediate sensation, the twisted foot and the happy days of times past.","Je disais que le monde est absurde et j\'allais trop vite. ce monde en lui-m\xeame n\'est pas raisonnable, c\'est tout ce qu\'on en peut dire.

This was the same hour, but with a difference; I was returning to a cell, and what awaited me was a night haunted by forebodings of the coming day. And so I learned that familiar paths traced in the dusk of summer evenings may lead as well to prisons as to innocent, untroubled sleep.","Foi ent\xe3o que tudo vacilou.

On the contrary, rebellion puts total freedom up for trial. It specifically attacks the unlimitedpower that authorizes a superior to violate the forbidden frontier. Far from demanding generalindependence, the rebel wants it to be recognized that freedom has its limits everywhere that a humanbeing is to be found\u2014the limit being precisely that human being\'s power to rebel. The most profoundreason for rebellious intransigence is to be found here. The more aware rebellion is of demanding a justlimit, the more inflexible it becomes. The rebel undoubtedly demands a certain degree of freedom forhimself; but in no case, if he is consistent, does he demand the right to destroy the existence and thefreedom of others. He humiliates no one. The freedom he claims, he claims for all; the freedom herefuses, he forbids everyone to enjoy. He is not only the slave against the master, but also man against theworld of master and slave. Therefore, thanks to rebellion, there is something more in history than therelation between mastery and servitude. Unlimited power is not the only law. It is in the name of anothervalue that the rebel affirms the impossibility of total freedom while he claims for himself the relativefreedom necessary to recognize this impossibility. Every human freedom, at its very roots, is thereforerelative. Absolute freedom, which is the freedom to kill, is the only one which does not claim, at the sametime as itself, the things that limitand obliterate it. Thus it cuts itself off from its roots and \u2014abstract and malevolent shade\u2014wandershaphazardly until such time as it imagines that it has found substance in some ideology.","And I, too, felt ready to start life all over again.

To feel it so like myself, indeed, so brotherly, made me realize that I\u2019d been happy, and that I was happy still.

Still greater production, still more power, uninterrupted labor, incessant suffering, permanent war, and then a moment will come when universal bondage in the totalitarian empire will be miraculously changed into its opposite: free leisure in a universal republic. Pseudo-revolutionary mystification has now acquired a formula: all freedom must be crushed in order to conquer the empire, and one day the empire will be the equivalent of freedom. And so the way to unity passes through totality.[...]Totality is, in effect, nothing other than the ancient dream of unity common to both believers and rebels, but projected horizontally onto an earth deprived of God. To renounce every value, therefore, amounts to renouncing rebellion in order to accept the Empire and slavery. Criticism of formal values cannot pass over the concept of freedom. Once the impossibility has been recognized of creating, by means of the forces of rebellion alone, the free individual of whom the romantics dreamed, freedom itself has also been incorporated in the movement of history. It has become freedom fighting for existence, which, in order to exist, must create itself. Identified with the dynamism of history, it cannot play its proper role until history comes to a stop, in the realization of the Universal City. Until then, every one of its victories will lead to an antithesis that will render it pointless. The German nation frees itself from its oppressors, but at the price of the freedom of every German. The individuals under a totalitarian regime are not free, even though man in the collective sense is free. Finally, when the Empire delivers the entire human species, freedom will reign over herds of slaves, who at least will be free in relation to God and, in general, in relation to every kind of transcendence.

On this earth, restored to the despair of innocence, a traveler lost in a primitive world, he regained contact, and with his list pressed to his chest, his face flattened against the glass, he calculated his hunger for himself and for the certainty of the splendors dormant within him. He wanted to crush himself into that mud, to reenter the earth by immersing himself in that clay, to stand on that limitless plain covered with dirt, stretching his arms to the sooty sponge of the sky, as though confronting the superb and despairing symbol of life itself, to affirm his solidarity with the world at its worst, to declare himself life\'s accomplice even in its thanklessness and its filth. Then the great impulse that had sustained him collapsed for the first time since he left Prague. Mersault pressed his tears and his lips against the cold pane. Again the glass blurred, the landscape disappeared.","The actors of the era knew they were excommunicated. Entering the profession amounted to choosing Hell.

He who, without negating it, does nothing for the eternal. Not that nostalgia is foreign to him. But he prefers his courage and his reasoning. The first teaches him to live without appeal and to get along with what he has; the second informs him of his limits. Assured of his temporally limited freedom, of his revolt devoid of future, and of his mortal consciousness, he lives out his adventure within the span of his lifetime. That is his field, that is his action, which he shields from any judgement but his own.","One of the villagers had left his home to try his luck abroad. After twenty five years, having made a fortune, he returned to his country with his wife and child. Meanwhile his mother and sister had been running a small hotel in the village where he was born. He decided to give them a surprise and, leaving his wife and child in another inn, he went to stay at his mother\u2019s place, booking a room under an assumed name. His mother and sister completely failed to recognize him. At dinner that evening he showed them a large sum of money he had on him, and in the course of the night they slaughtered him with a hammer. After taking the money they flung the body into the river. Next morning his wife came and, without thinking, betrayed the guest\u2019s identity. His mother hanged herself. His sister threw herself into a well.","Today, I feel free about the past and about what I have lost. All I want is this compactness and enclosed space\u2014this lucid and patient fervor. And like the warm bread that one kneads and presses I simply want to hold my life between my hands, like the men who knew how to enclose their life between these flowers and these columns. The same is true of those long nights spent on trains, where one can talk to oneself, prepare oneself for life, and feel marvelously patient in taking up ideas again, stopping them in their fight, and then once more moving forward. To lick one\'s life like a stick of barley sugar, to form, sharpen, and finally fall in love with it, in the same way as one searches for the word, the image, the definitive sentence, the word or image which marks a close or a conclusion, from which one can start out again and which will color the way we see the world. I can easily stop now, and finally reach the end of a year of unrestrained and over restrained life. My effort now is to carry this presence of myself to myself through to the very end, to maintain it whatever aspect my life takes on\u2014even at the price of the loneliness which I know is so difficult to bear. Not to give way\u2014that is the whole secret. Not to surrender, not to betray. All the violent part of my character helps me in this, carrying me to the point where I am rejoined by my love, and by the furious passion for life which gives meaning to my days.","-Nada en el mundo merece que se aparte uno de los que ama.

What bound him was the illusion of another world.","Day after day, Mersault let himself sink into his life as if he were sliding into water. And just as the swimmer advances by the complicity of his arms and the water which bears him up, helps him on, it was enough to make a few essential gestures - to rest one hand on a tree trunk, to take a run on the beach - in order to keep himself intact and conscious.","Quelle bouillie, quelle bouillie !

That is why it is impossible to pass judgment on the world. Any attempt toapply a standard of values to the world leads finally to a slander on life. Judgments are based on what is,with reference to what should be\u2014the kingdom of heaven, eternal concepts, or moral imperatives. Butwhat should be does not exist; and this world cannot be judged in the name of nothing. \\"The advantagesof our times: nothing is true, everything is permitted.\\" These magnificent or ironic formulas which areechoed by thousands of others, at least suffice to demonstrate that Nietzsche accepts the entire burden ofnihilism and rebellion. In his somewhat puerile reflections on \\"training and selection\\" he even formulatedthe extreme logic of nihilistic reasoning: \\"Problem: by what means could we obtain a strict form ofcomplete and contagious nihilism which would teach and practice, with complete scientific awareness,voluntary death?","Absurdul e ra\u021biunea lucid\u0103 care-\u0219i constat\u0103 limitele.","hay en los hombres m\xe1s cosas dignas de admiraci\xf3n que de desprecio.","Thus he became one with a life in its pure state, he rediscovered a paradise given only to the most private or the most intelligent animals.

Since all contemporary action leads to murder, direct or indirect, we cannot act until we know whether, and why, we have the right to kill.","Consciousness and revolt, these rejections are the contrary of renunciation. Everything that is indomitable and passionate in a human heart quickens them, on the contrary, with its own life. It is essential to die unreconciled and not of one\u2019s own free will. Suicide is a repudiation. The absurd man can only drain everything to the bitter end, and deplete himself. The absurd is his extreme tension, which he maintains constantly by solitary effort, for he knows that in that consciousness and in that day-to-day revolt he gives proof of his only truth, which is defiance.","That is the mission of the proletariat: to bring forth supreme dignity from supreme humiliation. Through its sufferingand its struggles, it is Christ in human form redeeming the collective sin of alienation.

It was as if that great rush of anger had washed me clean, emptied me of hope, and, gazing up at the dark sky spangled with its signs and stars, for the first time, the first, I laid my heart open to the benign indifference of the universe.","Stupidity has a knack of getting its way; as we should see if we were not always so much wrapped up in ourselves.","One becomes accustomed so quickly. A man wants to earn money in order to be happy, and his whole effort and the best of a life are devoted to the earning of that money. Happiness is forgotten; the means are taken for the end.","Christ, for Nietzsche as for Tolstoy, is not a rebel. The essence of His doctrine issummed up in total consent and in nonresistance to evil. Thou shalt not kill, even to prevent killing. Theworld must be accepted as it is, nothing must be added to its unhappiness, but you must consent to sufferpersonally from the evil it contains. The kingdom of heaven is within our immediate reach. It is only aninner inclination which allows us to make our actions coincide with these principles and which can giveus immediate salvation. Not faith but deeds\u2014that, according to Nietzsche, is Christ\'s message. From thenon, the history of Christianity is nothing but a long betrayal ofthis message. The New Testament is already corrupted, and from the time of Paul to the Councils,subservience to faith leads to the neglect of deeds.","Loneliness! What do you know of it? Only the loneliness of poets and weaklings. You prate of loneliness, but you don\u2019t realize that one is never alone. Always we are attended by the same load of the future and the past. Those we have killed are always with us. But they are no great trouble. It\u2019s those we have loved, those who loved us and whom we did not love; regrets, desires, bitterness and sweetness, whores and gods, the gang celestial! Always, always with us!","Impacientados por el presente, enemigos del pasado y privados del porvenir, \xe9ramos semejantes a aquellos que la justicia o el odio de los hombres tienen entre rejas","There lay certitude; there, in the daily round.  All the rest hung on mere threads and trivial contingencies; you couldn\'t waste your time on it. The thing was to do your job as it should be done.","This is so true that we rarely confide in those who are better than we. Rather, we are more inclined to flee their society. Most often, on the other hand, we confess to those who are like us and who share our weaknesses. Hence we don\u2019t want to improve ourselves or be bettered, for we should first have to be judged in default. We merely wish to be pitied and encouraged in the course we have chosen. In short, we should like, at the same time, to cease being guilty and yet not to make the effort of cleansing ourselves. Not enough cynicism and not enough virtue.","Uvijek se preuveli\u010dava ono \u0161to se ne poznaje.","And as far as he was concerned, he needed to be listened to in order to believe in his life.","Jacques avait d\xe9vor\xe9 les livres qui lui tombaient sous la main et les avalait avec la m\xeame avidit\xe9 qu\u2019il mettait \xe0 vivre, \xe0 jouer, \xe0 r\xeaver.","on ne peut pas bien vivre en sachant que l\'homme n\'est rien et que la face de Dieu est affreuse.","In vain a zealous evangelist with a fely hat and flowing tie threads his way through the crowd, crying without cease: \'God is great and good. Come unto Him.\' On the contrary, they all make haste toward some trivial objective that seems of more immediate interest than God.","You would not write about loneliness so much if you knew how to get the most out of it","Of all the schools of patience and lucidity, creation is the most effective. It is also the staggering evidence of man\'s sole dignity: the dogged revolt against his condition, perseverance in an effort considered sterile. It calls for a daily effort, self-mastery, a precise estimate of the limits of truth, measure, and strength. It constitutes an ascesis. All that \'for nothing,\' in order to repeat and mark time. But perhaps the great work of art has less importance in itself than in the ordeal it demands of a man and the opportunity it provides him of overcoming his phantoms and approaching a little closer to his naked reality.","Something must happen\u2014and that explains most human commitments. Something must happen, even loveless slavery, even war or death. Hurray then for funerals!","Ce matin, Marie est rest\xe9e et je lui ai dit que nous d\xe9jeunerions ensemble. Je suis descendu pour acheter de la viande. En remontant, j\'ai entendu une voix de femme dans la chambre de Raymond.

The result was that poor families were in great straits, while the rich went short of practically nothing. Thus, whereas plague by its impartial ministrations should have promoted equality among our townsfolk, it now had the opposite effect and, thanks to the habitual conflict of cupidities, exacerbated the sense of injustice rankling in men\u2019s hearts. They were assured, of course, of the inerrable equality of death, but nobody wanted that kind of equality.","Les lois sanglantes ensanglantent les m\u0153urs .","Thus and thus only the Christian could face the problem squarely and, scorning subterfuge, pierce to the heart of the supreme issues, the essential choice. And his choice would be to believe everything, so as not be forced into denying everything.","In addition, Ivan is the incarnation of the refusal to be the only one saved. He throws in his lot with thedamned and, for their sake, rejects eternity. If he had faith, he could, in fact, be saved, but others would be damned and suffering would continue. There is no possible salvation for the man who feels real compassion. Ivan will continue to put God in the wrong by doubly rejecting faith as he would reject injustice and privilege. One step more and from All or Nothingwe arrive at Everyone or No One.","\xce\u0163i faci \xeentotdeauna idei exagerate despre ceea ce nu cuno\u015fti.","Under another aspect the same is true for music. If any art is devoid of lessons, it is certainly music. It is too closely related to mathematics not to have borrowed their gratuitousness. That game the mind plays with itself according to set and measured laws takes place in the sonorous compass that belongs to us and beyond which the vibrations nevertheless meet in an inhuman universe. There is no purer sensation. These examples are too easy.

Dans cette chambre retranch\xe9e du monde, au-dessus de ce corps mort maintenant habill\xe9, Rieux sentit planer le calme surprenant qui, bien des nuits auparavant, sur les terrasses au-dessus de la peste, avait suivi l\'attaque des portes. D\xe9j\xe0, \xe0 cette \xe9poque, il avait pens\xe9 \xe0 ce silence qui s\'\xe9levait des lits o\xf9 il avait laiss\xe9 mourir des hommes. C\'\xe9tait partout la m\xeame pause, le m\xeame intervalle solennel, toujours le m\xeame apaisement qui suivait les combats, c\'\xe9tait le silence de la d\xe9faite. Mais pour celui qui enveloppait maintenant son ami, il \xe9tait si compact, il s\'accordait si \xe9troitement au silence des rues et de la ville lib\xe9r\xe9e de la peste, que Rieux sentait bien qu\'il s\'agissait cette fois de la d\xe9faite d\xe9finitive, celle qui termine les guerres et fait de la paix elle-m\xeame une souffrance sans gu\xe9rison. Le docteur ne savait pas si, pour finir, Tarrou avait retrouv\xe9 la paix, mais, dans ce moment tout au moins, il croyait savoir qu\'il n\'y aurait jamais plus de paix possible pour lui-m\xeame, pas plus qu\'il n\'y a d\'armistice pour la m\xe8re amput\xe9e de son fils ou pour l\'homme qui ensevelit son ami.","Quando estoura uma guerra, as pessoas dizem: N\xe3o vai durar muito, seria idiota\u201d. E sem d\xfavida uma guerra \xe9 uma tolice, o que n\xe3o a impede de durar. A tolice insiste sempre, e compreend\xea-la-\xedamos se n\xe3o pens\xe1ssemos sempre em n\xf3s. Nossos concidad\xe3os, a esse respeito, eram como todo mundo: pensavam em si pr\xf3prios. Em outras palavras, eram humanistas: n\xe3o acreditavam nos flagelos. O flagelo n\xe3o est\xe1 \xe0 altura do homem; diz-se ent\xe3o que o flagelo \xe9 irreal, que \xe9 um sonho mau que vai passar. Mas nem sempre ele passa e, de sonho mau em sonho mau, s\xe3o os homens que passam, e os humanistas em primeiro lugar, pois n\xe3o tomaram suas precau\xe7\xf5es. Nossos concidad\xe3os n\xe3o eram mais culpados que os outros. Apenas se esqueciam de ser modestos e pensavam que tudo ainda era poss\xedvel para eles, o que pressupunha que os flagelos eram imposs\xedveis. Continuavam a fazer neg\xf3cios, preparavam viagens e tinham opini\xf5es. Como poderiam ter pensado na peste, que suprime o futuro, os deslocamentos e as discuss\xf5es? Julgavam-se livres, e nunca algu\xe9m ser\xe1 livre enquanto houver flagelos.\u201d","What he had loved in Marthe were those evenings when they would walk into the movie theater and men\'s eyes turned toward her, that moment when he offered her to the world. What he loved in her was his power and his ambition to live. Even his desire, the deepest craving of his flesh, probably derived from this initial astonishment at possessing a lovely body, at mastering and humiliating it.","Et sans doute une guerre est certainement trop be\u0302te, mais cela ne l\u2019empe\u0302che pas de durer. La be\u0302tise insiste toujours, on s\u2019en apercevrait si l\u2019on ne pensait pas toujours a\u0300 soi. Nos concitoyens a\u0300 cet e\u0301gard e\u0301taient comme tout le monde, ils pensaient a\u0300 eux-me\u0302mes, autrement dit ils e\u0301taient humanistes : ils ne croyaient pas aux fle\u0301aux. Le fle\u0301au n\u2019est pas a\u0300 la mesure de l\u2019homme, on se dit donc que le fle\u0301au est irre\u0301el, c\u2019est un mauvais re\u0302ve qui va passer. Mais il ne passe pas toujours et, de mauvais re\u0302ve en mauvais re\u0302ve, ce sont les hommes qui passent, et les humanistes en premier lieu, parce qu\u2019ils n\u2019ont pas pris leurs pre\u0301cautions.","Every man has felt himself to be the equal of a god at certain moments. But this comes from the fact that in a flash he felt the amazing grandeur of the human mind. The conquerors are merely those among men who are conscious enough of their strength to be sure of living constantly on those heights and fully aware of the grandeur. The conquerors are capable of more. But they are capable of no more than man himself when he wants.","All of Dostoevsky\u2019s heroes question themselves as to the meaning of life. In this they are modern: they do not fear ridicule. What distinguishes modern sensibility from classical sensibility is that the latter thrives on moral programs and the former on metaphysical programs. In Dostoevsky\u2019s novels the question is propounded with such intensity that it can only invite extreme solutions. Existence is illusory or it is eternal. If Dostoevsky were satisfied with this inquiry, he would be a philosopher. But he illustrates the consequences that such intellectual pastimes may have in a man\u2019s life, and in this regard he is an artist.","I got up right away because I was hungry, but Marie told me I hadn\u2019t kissed her since that morning. It was true, and yet I had wanted to. \u201cCome into the water, she said. We ran and threw ourselves into the first little waves. We swam a few strokes and she reached out and held on to me. I felt her legs wrapped around mine and I wanted her.\u201d","Lo \xfanico que me interesa - le dije- es encontrar la paz interior.","Rieux knew what the old man was thinking at that moment as he wept, and he thought the same: that this world without love was like a dead world and that there always comes a time when one grows tired of prisons, work and courage, and years for the face of another human being and the wondering, affectionate heart.","Therefore, (and the difficult thing was not to lose sight of all the reasoning that went into this \u201ctherefore), I had to accept the rejection of my appeal.

If a mass death sentence defines the human condition, then rebellion, inone sense, is its contemporary. At the same time that he rejects his mortality, the rebel refuses to recognize thepower that compels him to live in this condition. The metaphysical rebel is therefore not definitely an atheist, as onemight think him, but he is inevitably a blasphemer. Quite simply, he blasphemes primarily in the name of order,denouncing God as the father of death and as the supreme outrage.","It was a rustling sound that woke me up. Because I\'d had my eyes closed, the whiteness of the room seemed even brighter than before. There wasn\'t a shadow anywhere in front of me, and every object, every angle and curve stood out so sharply it made my eyes hurt. That\'s when Maman\'s friends came in. There were about ten in all, and they floated into the blinding light without a sound. They sat down without a single chair creaking. I saw them more clearly than I had ever seen anyone, and not one detail of their faces or their clothes escaped me. But I couldn\'t hear them, and it was hard for me to believe that they really existed. Almost all the women were wearing aprons, and the strings, which were tied tight around their waists, made their bulging stomachs stick out even more. I\'d never noticed what huge stomachs old women can have. Almost all the men were skinny and carried canes. What struck me most about their faces was that I couldn\'t see their eyes, just a faint glimmer in a nest of wrinkles. When they\'d sat down, most of them looked at me and nodded awkwardly, their lips sucked in by their toothless mouths, so that I couldn\'t tell if they were greeting me or if it was just a nervous tic. I think they were greeting me. It was then that I realized they were all sitting across from me, nodding their heads, grouped around the caretaker. For a second I had the ridiculous feeling that they were there to judge me.","I realized then that a man who had lived only one day could easily live for a hundred years in prison. He would have enough memories to keep him from being bored. In a way, it was an advantage.","Here is the faithful night, the cool night which I called for amid the noise of lights, drink and the tumult of desire.","We do not have feelings which change us, but feelings that suggest to us the idea of change.

In the midst of tears, I found there was, within me, an invincible smile. In the midst of chaos, I found there was, within me, an invincible calm. I realized, through it all, that in the midst of winter, I found there was, within me, an invincible summer. And that makes me happy. For it says that no matter how hard the world pushes against me, within me, there\u2019s something stronger \u2013 something better, pushing right back.","I people the universe with forms in my own likeness.

If creation is impossible during wars and revolutions, then we shall have no creative artists,for war and revolution are our lot. The myth of unlimited production brings war in its train as inevitablyas clouds announce a storm. Wars lay waste to the West and kill the flower of a generation.

It now becomes clear on the contrary that it will be lived all the better if it has no meaning. Living an experience, a particular fate, is accepting it fully.

Sekarang, aku mengerti bahwa bertindak dan bercinta dan menderita, adalah hidup, memang, tapi itu hanyalah hidup dalam tahapan di mana kau jujur dan menerima hidupmu begitu saja, seperti pantulan satu-satunya dari pelangi kebahagiaan yang sama cantiknya, atau jeleknya, untuk semua orang.","\u041b\u044e\u0431\u043e\u0432\u044c \u043c\u043e\u0436\u0435\u0442 \u0438 \u0443\u0431\u0438\u0442\u044c, \u043f\u0440\u0438\u0447\u0435\u043c \u0442\u043e\u043b\u044c\u043a\u043e \u0440\u0430\u0434\u0438 \u0441\u0435\u0431\u044f \u0436\u0435 \u0441\u0430\u043c\u043e\u0439.\u0418\u043c\u0435\u0435\u0442\u0441\u044f \u0434\u0430\u0436\u0435 \u043d\u0435\u043a\u0430\u044f \u0433\u0440\u0430\u043d\u044c, \u0437\u0430 \u043a\u043e\u0442\u043e\u0440\u043e\u0439 \u043b\u044e\u0431\u043e\u0432\u044c \u043a \u043e\u0434\u043d\u043e\u043c\u0443 \u0447\u0435\u043b\u043e\u0432\u0435\u043a\u0443 \u0432\u043b\u0435\u0447\u0435\u0442 \u0437\u0430\u0441\u043e\u0431\u043e\u0439 \u0443\u0431\u0438\u0439\u0441\u0442\u0432\u043e \u043e\u0441\u0442\u0430\u043b\u044c\u043d\u044b\u0445. \u0412 \u043d\u0435\u043a\u043e\u0442\u043e\u0440\u043e\u043c \u0441\u043c\u044b\u0441\u043b\u0435 \u043b\u044e\u0431\u043e\u0432\u044c \u043f\u0440\u0435\u0434\u043f\u043e\u043b\u0430\u0433\u0430\u0435\u0442\u043e\u0434\u043d\u043e\u0432\u0440\u0435\u043c\u0435\u043d\u043d\u043e \u043b\u0438\u0447\u043d\u0443\u044e \u0432\u0438\u043d\u0443. \u041a\u043e\u0442\u043e\u0440\u0443\u044e \u043a \u0442\u043e\u043c\u0443 \u0436\u0435 \u043d\u0435 \u043f\u0435\u0440\u0435\u043b\u043e\u0436\u0438\u0448\u044c \u043d\u0430 \u0434\u0440\u0443\u0433\u043e\u0433\u043e. \u0418\u043a\u043e\u0442\u043e\u0440\u0430\u044f \u0442\u0435\u043c \u0442\u044f\u0436\u0435\u043b\u0435\u0435, \u0447\u0435\u043c \u044f\u0432\u0441\u0442\u0432\u0435\u043d\u043d\u0435\u0439 \u043f\u043e\u043b\u043d\u043e\u0435 \u043e\u0442\u0441\u0443\u0442\u0441\u0442\u0432\u0438\u0435 \u0440\u0430\u0437\u0443\u043c\u043d\u043e\u0433\u043e \u0430\u043b\u0438\u0431\u0438.\u041f\u0440\u0438\u0445\u043e\u0434\u0438\u0442\u0441\u044f \u0432 \u043e\u0434\u0438\u043d\u043e\u0447\u043a\u0443 \u0440\u0435\u0448\u0430\u0442\u044c, \u043b\u044e\u0431\u0438\u0448\u044c \u0442\u044b \u0438\u043b\u0438 \u043d\u0435\u0442, \u0438 \u0432 \u043e\u0434\u0438\u043d\u043e\u0447\u043a\u0443 \u0436\u0435 \u043e\u0442\u0432\u0435\u0447\u0430\u0442\u044c \u0437\u0430\u043d\u0435\u043f\u0440\u0435\u0434\u0441\u043a\u0430\u0437\u0443\u0435\u043c\u044b\u0435 \u043f\u043e\u0441\u043b\u0435\u0434\u0441\u0442\u0432\u0438\u044f \u043d\u0430\u0441\u0442\u043e\u044f\u0449\u0435\u0439 \u043b\u044e\u0431\u0432\u0438. \u042d\u0442\u043e\u043c\u0443 \u0447\u0440\u0435\u0432\u0430\u0442\u043e\u043c\u0443 \u0440\u0438\u0441\u043a\u043e\u043c\u043e\u0434\u0438\u043d\u043e\u0447\u0435\u0441\u0442\u0432\u0443 \u0447\u0435\u043b\u043e\u0432\u0435\u043a \u043e\u0431\u044b\u0447\u043d\u043e \u043f\u0440\u0435\u0434\u043f\u043e\u0447\u0438\u0442\u0430\u0435\u0442 \u043d\u0435 \u0441\u043b\u0438\u0448\u043a\u043e\u043c \u043f\u044b\u043b\u043a\u043e\u0435 \u0441\u0435\u0440\u0434\u0446\u0435 \u0432\u043a\u0443\u043f\u0435 \u0441\u043d\u0430\u0431\u043e\u0440\u043e\u043c \u043c\u043e\u0440\u0430\u043b\u044c\u043d\u044b\u0445 \u043f\u0440\u0438\u043d\u0446\u0438\u043f\u043e\u0432. \u041e\u043d \u0431\u043e\u0438\u0442\u0441\u044f \u0441\u0430\u043c \u0441\u0435\u0431\u044f \u0438 \u0440\u0430\u0434\u0438 \u0441\u0430\u043c\u043e\u0433\u043e \u0436\u0435 \u0441\u0435\u0431\u044f. \u041e\u043d\u0445\u043e\u0447\u0435\u0442 \u0443\u0431\u0435\u0440\u0435\u0447\u044c \u0441\u0435\u0431\u044f, \u043e\u0442\u043a\u0430\u0437\u044b\u0432\u0430\u044f\u0441\u044c \u043f\u0440\u0438 \u044d\u0442\u043e\u043c \u043e\u0442 \u0441\u0432\u043e\u0435\u0433\u043e \u043f\u0440\u0435\u0434\u043d\u0430\u0437\u043d\u0430\u0447\u0435\u043d\u0438\u044f. \u0418\u0433\u043b\u0430\u0432\u043d\u0435\u0439\u0448\u0435\u0439 \u0435\u0433\u043e \u0437\u0430\u0431\u043e\u0442\u043e\u0439 \u0441\u0442\u0430\u043d\u043e\u0432\u0438\u0442\u0441\u044f \u043f\u043e\u0438\u0441\u043a \u043e\u043f\u0440\u0430\u0432\u0434\u0430\u043d\u0438\u044f, \u043a\u043e\u0442\u043e\u0440\u043e\u0435 \u043e\u0431\u043b\u0435\u0433\u0447\u0438\u043b\u043e \u0431\u044b\u0445\u043e\u0442\u044c \u043d\u0435\u043c\u043d\u043e\u0433\u043e \u0431\u0440\u0435\u043c\u044f \u0435\u0433\u043e \u0432\u0438\u043d\u044b. \u0420\u0430\u0437 \u0443\u0436 \u044d\u0442\u043e\u0439 \u0432\u0438\u043d\u044b \u043d\u0435 \u0438\u0437\u0431\u0435\u0436\u0430\u0442\u044c, \u043f\u0443\u0441\u0442\u044c, \u043f\u043e \u043a\u0440\u0430\u0439\u043d\u0435\u0439\u043c\u0435\u0440\u0435, \u043e\u043d\u0430 \u043d\u0435 \u043b\u0435\u0436\u0438\u0442 \u043d\u0430 \u0442\u0435\u0431\u0435 \u043e\u0434\u043d\u043e\u043c.","It is during that return, that pause, that Sisyphus interests me. A face that toils so close to stones is already stone itself! I see that man going back down with a heavy yet measured step toward the torment of which he will never know the end. That hour like a breathing-space which returns as surely as his suffering, that is the hour of consciousness. At each of those moments when he leaves the heights and gradually sinks toward the lairs of the gods, he is superior to his fate. He is stronger than his rock.If this myth is tragic, that is because its hero is conscious. Where would his torture be, indeed, if at every step the hope of succeeding upheld him? The workman of today works everyday in his life at the same tasks, and his fate is no less absurd. But it is tragic only at the rare moments when it becomes conscious. Sisyphus, proletarian of the gods, powerless and rebellious, knows the whole extent of his wretched condition: it is what he thinks of during his descent. The lucidity that was to constitute his torture at the same time crowns his victory. There is no fate that cannot be surmounted by scorn.","Mitten im tiefen Winter wurde mir endlich bewusst, dass ich einen unbesiegbaren Sommer in mir trug.","The evil in the world comes almost always from ignorance, and goodwill can cause as much damage as ill-will if it is not enlightened.","Apriori \u015fi invers\xeend termenii problemei, dup\u0103 cum omul se sinucide sau nu se sinucide, s-ar p\u0103rea ca nu exist\u0103 dec\xeet dou\u0103 solu\u0163ii filosofice: a spune da sau nu.

A derisory equivalent of the satisfaction that the order of the world failed to give him was provided for him by dreams and by creative activity. The writer,of course, has no need to refuse himself anything. For him, at least, boundaries disappear and desire canbe allowed free rein. In this respect Sade is the perfect man of letters. He created a fable in order to givehimself the illusion of existing.","Killing yourself amounts to confessing.

Sometimes we toyed with our imagination, composing ourselves to wait for a ring at the bell announcing somebody\u2019s return, or for the sound of a familiar footstep on the stairs; but, though we might deliberately stay at home at the hour when a traveler coming by the evening train would normally have arrived, and though we might contrive to forget for the moment that no trains were running, that game of make-believe, for obvious reasons, could not last.","She turned towards me.

The former starts from a negative supported by an affirmative, the latter from absolute negationand is condemned to every aspect of slavery in order to fabricate an affirmative that is dismissed until theend of time. One is creative, the other nihilist. The first is dedicated to creation so as to exist more andmore completely; the second is forced to produce results in order to negate more and more completely.The historical revolution is always obliged to act in the hope, which is invariably disappointed, of one dayreally existing. Even unanimous consent will not suffice to create its existence. \\"Obey,\\" said Frederick theGreat to his subjects; but when he died, his words were: \\"I am tired of ruling slaves.\\" To escape thisabsurd destiny, the revolution is and will be condemned to renounce, not only its own principles, butnihilism as well as purely historical values in order to rediscover the creative source of rebellion.Revolution, in order to be creative, cannot do without either a moral or metaphysical rule to balance theinsanity of history. Undoubtedly, it has nothing but scorn for the formal and mystifying morality to befound in bourgeois society. But its folly has been to extend this scorn to every moral demand. At the verysources of its inspiration and in its most profound transports is to be found a rule that is not formal butthat nevertheless can serve as a guide. Rebellion, in fact, says\u2014 and will say more and more explicitly\u2014that revolution must try to act, not in order to come into existence at some future date in the eyes of aworld reduced to acquiescence, but in terms of the obscure existence that is already made manifest in theact of insurrection. This rule is neither formal nor subject to history, it is what can be best described byexamining it in its pure state\u2014in artistic creation. Before doing so, let us only note that to the \\"I rebel,therefore we exist\\" and the \\"We are alone\\" of metaphysical rebellion, rebellion at grips with history addsthat instead of killing and dying in order to produce the being that we are not, we have to live and let livein order to create what we are.","Cuando se ha meditado largamente sobre el hombre, por oficio o por vocaci\xf3n, se llega a sentir cierta nostalgia por los primates.

At thispitch of indignation, reason becomes madness.

The rebel slave affirms that there is something in him which will not tolerate the manner in which his master treats him; the metaphysical rebel declares that he is frustrated by the universe. For both of them it is not only a problem of pure and simple negation. In fact in both cases we find an assessment of values in the name of which the rebel refuses to accept the condition in which he finds himself. The slave who opposes his master is not concerned, let us note, with repudiating his master as a human being. He is repudiating him as master. He denies his right to deny him, as a slave, by making excessive demands. The master fails to the extent that he does not respond to a demand that he ignores. If men cannot refer to common values, which they all separately recognize, then man is incomprehensible to man. The rebel demands that these values should be clearly recognized as part of himself because he knows or suspects that, without them, crime and disorder would reign in the world. An act of rebellion seems to him like a demand for clarity and unity. The most elementary rebellion, paradoxically, expresses an aspiration to order. This description can be applied, word for word, to the metaphysical rebel. He attacks a shattered world to make it whole. He confronts the injustice at large in the world with his own principles of justice. Thus all he originally wants is to resolve this contradiction and establish a reign of justice, if he can, or of injustice if he is driven to the end of his tether. Meanwhile he denounces the contradiction. Metaphysical rebellion is the justified claim of a desire for unity against the suffering of life and death \u2013 in that it protests against the incompleteness of human life, expressed by death, and its dispersion, expressed by evil. If a mass death sentence defines man\u2019s condition, then rebellion, in one sense, is its contemporary.","La v\xe9rit\xe9 est myst\xe9rieuse, fuyante, toujours\xe0 conqu\xe9rir.

A onda, jednog jutra, ulica je odjednom bila pusta. No\u0107u, tik pred zoru, laste su zajedno odletale na jug.

This contradiction, which has becomeonly too obvious, prevents our contemporary revolutionaries from displaying that aspect of happiness andoptimism which shone forth from the faces and the speeches of the members of the Constituent Assemblyin 1789. Is this contradiction inevitable? Does it characterize or betray the value of rebellion? Thesequestions are bound to arise about revolution as they are bound to arise about metaphysical rebellion.Actually, revolution is only the logical consequence of metaphysical rebellion, and we shall discover, inour analysis of the revolutionary movement, the same desperate and bloody effort to affirm the dignity ofman in defiance of the things that deny its existence. The revolutionary spirit thus undertakes the defenseof that part of man which refuses to submit. In other words, it tries to assure himhis crown in the realm of time, and, rejecting God, it chooses history with an apparently inevitable logic.","But practically I know men and recognize them by their behavior, by the totality of their deeds, by the consequences caused in life by their presence.","Si tu devais mourir, j\'envierais jusqu\'\xe0 la terre qui \xe9pouserait ton corps!","In a man\'s attachment to life there is something stronger than all the ills in the world.","\u0632\u06cc\u0633\u062a\u0646 \u0627\u0646\u0633\u0627\u0646\u060c \u062a\u0646\u0647\u0627 \u0628\u0627 \u0622\u0646\u0686\u0647 \u0645\u06cc\u200c\u062f\u0627\u0646\u062f \u0648 \u0622\u0646\u0686\u0647 \u0628\u0647 \u06cc\u0627\u062f \u0645\u06cc\u200c\u0622\u0648\u0631\u062f \u0648 \u0645\u062d\u0631\u0648\u0645 \u0627\u0632\u0622\u0646\u0686\u0647 \u0622\u0631\u0632\u0648 \u062f\u0627\u0631\u062f\u060c \u0686\u0647 \u062f\u0634\u0648\u0627\u0631 \u0627\u0633\u062a.","Anyway, remembering Marie meant nothing to me.

He eliminates as much as he includes.","I answered that, of recent years, I\u2019d rather lost the habit of noting my feelings, and hardly knew what to answer.

For while he himself spoke from the depths of long days of brooding upon his personal distress, and the image he had tried to impart had been slowly shaped and proved in the fires of passion and regret, this meant nothing to the man to whom he was speaking, who pictured a conventional emotion, a grief that is traded on the market-place, mass-produced.","Oh, it must be an epidemic,\' the priest said; and his eyes were smiling behind his glasses.","Oui, on peut faire la guerre en ce monde, singer l\'amour, torturer son semblable, parader dans les journaux, ou simplement dire du mal de son voisin en tricotant.

God is dead, but as Stirnerpredicted, the morality of principles in which the memory of God is still preserved must also be killed.The hatred of formal virtue\u2014degraded witness to divinity and false witness in the service of injustice\u2014has remained one of the principal themes of history today.

Itcan equally well be said of the poets who rushed to assault the heavens, with the intent of turningeverything upside down, that by so doing they affirmed their desperate nostalgia for order. As an ultimatecontradiction, they wanted to extract reason from unreason and to systematize the irrational. These heirsof romanticism claimed to make poetry exemplary and to find, in its most harrowing aspects, the real wayof life. They deified blasphemy and transformed poetry into experience and into a means of action. Untiltheir time those who claimed to influence men and events, at least in the Occident, did so in the name ofrational rules. On the contrary, surrealism, after Rimbaud, wanted to find constructive rules in insanityand destruction. Rimbaud, through his work and onlythrough his work, pointed out the path, but with the blinding, momentary illumination of a flash oflightning. Surrealism excavated this path and codified its discoveries. By its excesses as well as by itsretreats, it gave the last and most magnificent expression to a practical theory of irrational rebellion at thevery same time when, on another path, rebellious thought was founding the cult of absolute reason.Lautreamont and Rimbaud\u2014its sources of inspiration\u2014demonstrate by what stages the irrational desireto accept appearances can lead the rebel to adopt courses of action completely destructive to freedom","I meet with my soulmate but she didn\'t.","S-ar putea crede c\u0103 sinuciderea urmeaz\u0103 revoltei.

The rebel does not ask for life, but for reasons for living.He rejects the consequences implied by death. If nothing lasts, then nothing is justified; everything that dies isdeprived of meaning.

For it does not represent the logical outcome of the revolt. It is just the contrary by the consent it presupposes. Suicide, like the leap, is acceptance at its extreme. Everything is over and man returns to his essential history. His future, his unique and dreadful future - he sees and rushes towards it. In its way, suicide settles the absurd. It engulfs the absurd in the same death. But I know that in order to keep alive, the absurd cannot be settled. It escapes suicide to the extent that it is simultaneously awareness and rejection of death. It is, at the extreme limit of the condemned man\'s last thought, that shoelace that despite everything he sees few yards away, on the very brink of his dizzying fall. The contrary of suicide, in fact, is a man condemned to death.","[E]verything contributes to spreading confusion.","In the absurd world the value of a notion or of a life is measured by its sterility.","The problem of the seizure of power brings in its train the problem of the State.

But no one in the world believed in a God of that sort; no, not even Paneloux, who believed that he believed in such a God.

There again Marx and Engels are largely used to prove, authoritatively, that the proletarianState is not a State organized on the lines of other states, but a State which, by definition, is in the process ofwithering away. \\"As soon as there is no longer a social class which must be kept oppressed ... a State ceases to benecessary.

For thegovernment of people is substituted the administration of things. . . . The State is not abolished, it perishes.\\" Thebourgeois State is first suppressed by the proletariat. Then, but only then, the proletarian State fades away.

As for those that we perceive, they carry sounds to us, occasionally achord, never a melody. Music exists, however, in which symphonies are completed, where melody givesits form to sounds that by themselves have none, and where, finally, a particular arrangement of notesextracts from natural disorder a unity that is satisfying to the mind and the heart.","Already, in fact, rebellion, without claiming to solve everything, can at least confront its problems. Fromthis moment high noon is borne away on the fast-moving stream of history. Around the devouring flames,shadows writhe in mortal combat for an instant of time and then as suddenly disappear, and the blind,fingering their eyelids, cry out that this is history. The men of Europe, abandoned to the shadows, haveturned their backs upon the fixed and radiant point of the present. They forget the present for the future,the fate of humanity for the delusion of power, the misery of the slums for the mirage of the eternal city,ordinary justice for an empty promised land. They despair of personal freedom and dream of a strangefreedom of the species; reject solitary death and give the name of immortality to a vast collective agony.They no longer believe in the things that exist in the world and in living man; the secret of Europe is thatit no longer loves life. Its blind men entertain the puerile belief that to love one single day of life amountsto justifying whole centuries of oppression. That is why they wanted to efface joy from the world and topostpone it until a much later date. Impatience with limits, the rejection of their double life, despair atbeing a man, have finally driven them to inhuman excesses.

Yet, in the samepamphlet, he ends by justifying the preservation, even after the socialization of the means of production and, withoutany predictable end, of the dictatorship of a revolutionary faction over the rest of the people. The pamphlet, whichmakes continual reference to the experiences of the Commune, flatly contradicts the contemporary federalist andanti-authoritarian ideas that produced the Commune; and it is equally opposed to the optimistic forecasts of Marxand Engels. The reason for this is clear; Lenin had not forgotten that the Commune failed. As for the means of sucha surprising demonstration, they were even more simple: with each new difficulty encountered by the revolution, theState as described by Marx is endowed with a supplementary prerogative. Ten pages farther on, without any kind oftransition, Lenin in effect affirms that power is necessary to crush the resistance of the exploiters \\"and also to directthe great mass of the population, peasantry, lower middle classes, and semi-proletariat, in the management of thesocialist economy.\\" The shift here is undeniable; the provisional State of Marx and Engels is charged with a newmission, which risks prolonging its life indefinitely. Already we can perceive the contradiction of the Stalinistregime in conflict with its official philosophy. Either this regime has realized the classless socialist society, and themaintenance of a formidable apparatus of repression is not justified in Marxist terms, or it has not realized theclassless society and has therefore proved that Marxist doctrine is erroneous and, in particular, that the socializationof the means of production does not mean the disappearance of classes. Confronted with its official doctrine, theregime is forced to choose: the doctrine is false, or the regime has betrayed it. In fact, together with Nechaiev andTkachev, it is Lassalle, the inventor of State socialism, whom Lenin has caused to triumph in Russia, to thedetriment of Marx. From this moment on, the history of the interior struggles of the party, from Lenin to Stalin, issummed up in the struggle between the workers\' democracy and military and bureaucratic dictatorship; in otherwords, between justice and expediency.","m. At this moment, when each of us must fit an arrow to his bow and enter the lists anew, toreconquer, within history and in spite of it, that which he owns already, the thin yield of his fields, thebrief love of this earth, at this moment when at last a man is born, it is time to forsake our age and itsadolescent furies. The bow bends; the wood complains. At the moment of supreme tension, there will leapinto flight an unswerving arrow, a shaft that is inflexible and free.","At first people had agreed to being cut off from the outside as they might have accepted any temporary irritation that would only interfere with a few of their habits.

It demonstrates how the rebel who takes to action is tempted to succumb, if he forgets his origins, to the most absolute conformity. And so it explains the twentieth century. Lautreamont, who is usually hailed as the bard of pure rebellion, on the contrary proclaims the advent of the taste for intellectual servitude which flourishes in the contemporary world.","felt that I had been happy and that I was happy again.

Tenacity and acumen are privileged spectators of this inhuman show in which absurdity, hope, and death carry on their dialogue. The mind can then analyze the figures of that elementary yet subtle dance before illustrating them and reliving them itself. Absurd Walls Like great works, deep feelings always mean more than they are conscious of saying. The regularity of an impulse or a repulsion in a soul is encountered again in habits of doing or thinking, is reproduced in consequences of which the soul itself knows nothing. Great feelings take with them their own universe, splendid or abject. They light up with their passion an exclusive world in which they recognize their climate.","But a man\'s beauty represents inner, functional truths: his face shows what he can do.","There is something divine in mindless beauty, and Mersault was particularly responsive to it.","Cinta adalah keinginan yang menyengsarakan, tapi jangan pernah berpikir kalau cinta tidak berguna.

From the rule of the masses and the concept of the proletarian revolution we first pass on to the ideaof a revolution made and directed by professional agents. The relentless criticism of the State is then reconciled withthe necessary, but provisional, dictatorship of the proletariat, embodied in its leaders. Finally, it is announced thatthe end of this provisional condition cannot be foreseen and that, what is more, no one has ever presumed to promisethat there will be an end.","Men are not convinced of your arguments, your sincerity or the seriousness of your suffering, except by your death.

No code of ethics and no effort are justifiable a priori in the face of the cruel mathematics that command our condition.","Meanwhile, in a lecture at the Sverdlov University two years later, under thepressure of outside events and interior realities, Lenin spoke with a precision which left little doubt about theindefinite continuation of the proletarian super-State. \\"With this machine, or rather this weapon [the State], we shallcrush every form of exploitation, and when there are no longer any possibilities of exploitation left on earth, no morepeople owning land or factories, no more people gorging themselves under the eyes of others who are starving,when such things become impossible, then and only then shall we cast this machine aside. Then there will be neitherState nor exploitation.\\" Therefore as long as there exists on earth, and no longer in a specific society, one singleoppressed person and one proprietor, so long the State will continue to exist. It also will be obliged to increase instrength during this period so as to vanquish one by one the injustices, the governments responsible for injustice, theobstinately bourgeois nations, and the people who are blind to their own interests. And when, on an earth that hasfinally been subdued and purged of enemies, the final iniquity shall have been drowned in the blood of the just andthe unjust, then the State, which has reached the limit of all power, a monstrous idol covering the entire earth, willbe discreetly absorbed into the silent city of Justice.Under the easily predictable pressure of adverse imperialism, the imperialism of justice was born, in reality, withLenin. But imperialism, even the imperialism of justice, has no other end but defeat or world empire. Untilthen it has no other means but injustice. From now on, the doctrine is definitively identified with theprophecy. For the sake of justice in the far-away future, it authorizes injustice throughout the entire courseof history and becomes the type of mystification which Lenin detested more than anything else in theworld. It contrives the acceptance of injustice, crime, and falsehood by the promise of a miracle. Stillgreater production, still more power, uninterrupted labor, incessant suffering, permanent war, and then amoment will come when universal bondage in the totalitarian empire will be miraculously changed intoits opposite: free leisure in a universal republic. Pseudo-revolutionary mystification has now acquired aformula: all freedom must be crushed in order to conquer the empire, and one day the empire will be theequivalent of freedom. And so the way to unity passes through totality.","Parfois, tard dans ces nuits o\xf9 la danse, l\u2019alcool l\xe9ger, mon d\xe9cha\xeenement, le violent abandon de chacun, me jetaient dans un ravissement \xe0 la fois las et combl\xe9, il me semblait, \xe0 l\u2019extr\xe9mit\xe9 de la fatigue, et l\u2019espace d\u2019une seconde, que je comprenais enfin le secret des \xeatres et du monde.

At the same time I knew that that was ridiculous because, after all, I was the criminal.","Ce qu\'on appelle une raison de vivre est en m\xeame temps une excellente raison de mourir","If those whom we begin to love could know us as we were before meeting them...they could perceive what they have made of us.","Poverty is a state whose feature is generosity.","Un amour, Maria, \xe7a ne se conquiert pas sur le monde mais sur soi-m\xeame.","[A writer] cannot serve today those who make history; he must serve those who are subject to it.","\u0625\u0646 \u0637\u0631\u064a\u0642 \u0627\u0644\u062d\u064a\u0627\u0629 \u0648\u0639\u0631\u064c \u0648\u0634\u0627\u0642 \u0628\u062f\u0648\u0646 \u0645\u0633\u0627\u0639\u062f\u0629 \u0627\u0644\u062f\u064a\u0646 \u0648\u0627\u0644\u0641\u0646 \u0648\u0627\u0644\u062d\u0628","It is not the melancholy of ruined things that breaks the heart, but the desperate love of what lasts eternally in eternal youth: love of the future.","Totality is, in effect, nothing other than the ancient dream of unity common to both believers and rebels,but projected horizontally onto an earth deprived of God. To renounce every value, therefore, amounts torenouncing rebellion in order to accept the Empire and slavery. Criticism of formal values cannot passover the concept of freedom. Once the impossibility has been recognized of creating, by means of theforces of rebellion alone, the free individual of whom the romantics dreamed, freedom itself has also beenincorporated in the movement of history. It has become freedom fighting for existence, which, in order toexist, must create itself. Identified with the dynamism of history, it cannot play its proper role untilhistory comes to a stop, in the realization of the Universal City. Until then, every one of its victories willlead to an antithesis that will render it pointless","The life of the body, reduced to itsessentials, paradoxically produces an abstract and gratuitous universe, continuously denied, in its turn, byreality. This type of novel, purged of interior life, in which men seem to be observed behind a pane ofglass, logically ends, with its emphasis on the pathological, by giving itself as its unique subject thesupposedly average man. In this way it is possible to explain the extraordinary number of \\"innocents\\"who appear in this universe. The simpleton is the ideal subject for such an enterprise since he can only bedefined\u2014and completely defined\u2014by his behavior. He is the symbol of the despairing world in whichwretched automatons live in a machine-ridden universe, which American novelists have presented as aheart-rending but sterile protest.","It is probably true that a man remains forever unknown to us and that there is in him something irreducible that escapes us.","Vivre, naturellement, n\'est jamais facile.

Unless we accept death, we must be willing to kill in order to beunique. \\"You are not as noble as a criminal, you who do not desecrate anything.\\" Moreover Stirner, stillwithout the courage of his convictions, specifies: \\"Kill them, do not martyr them.\\"But to decree that murder is legitimate is to decree mobilization and war for all the Unique. Thus murderwill coincide with a kind of collective suicide. Stirner, who either does not admit or does not see this,nevertheless does not recoil at the idea of any form of destruction. The spirit of rebellion finally discoversone of its bitterest satisfactions in chaos. \\"You [the German nation] will be struck down. Soon your sisternations will follow you; when all of them have gone your way, humanity will be buried, and on its tomb I,sole master of myself at last, I, heir to all the human race, will shout with laughter.\\" And so, among theruins of the world, the desolate laughter of the individual-king illustrates the last victory of the spirit ofrebellion. But at this extremity nothing else is possible but death or resurrection. Stirner, and with him allthe nihilist rebels, rush to the utmost limits, drunk with destruction. After which, when the desert has beendisclosed, the next step is to learn how to live there. Nietzsche\'s exhaustive search then begins.","What I know most surely about morality and the duty of man I owe to sport.","But total freedom is no more easy to conquer than individual freedom. To ensure man\'s empire over theworld, it is necessary to suppress in the world and in man everything that escapes the Empire, everythingthat does not come under the reign of quantity: and this is an endless undertaking. The Empire mustembrace time, space, and people, which compose the three dimensions of history. It is simultaneouslywar, obscurantism, and tyranny, desperately affirming that one day it will be liberty, fraternity, and truth;the logic of its postulates obliges it to do so","For Mersault, nothing mattered in those days. And the first time Marthe went limp in his arms and her features blurred as they came closer - the lips that had been as motionless as painted flowers now quivering and extended - Mersault saw in her not the future but all the force of his desire focused upon her and and satisfied by this appearance, this image. The lips she offered him seemed a message from a world without passion and swollen with desire, where his heart would find satisfaction. And this seemed a miracle to him. His heard pounded with an emotion he almost took for love. And when he felt the ripe and resilient flesh under his teeth, it was as though he bit into a kind of fierce liberty, after caressing her a long time with his own lips. She became his mistress that same day.","Finally, if we add to these observations the remark that Marx owes to the bourgeois economists the idea, which heclaims exclusively as his own, of the part played by industrial production in the development of humanity, and thathe took the essentials of his theory of work-value from Ricardo, an economist of the bourgeois industrialrevolution, our right to say that his prophecy is bourgeois in content will doubtless be recognized. Thesecomparisons only aim to show that Marx, instead of being, as the fanatical Marxists of our day wouldhave it, the beginning and the end of the prophecy, participates on the contrary in human nature: he is anheir before he is a pioneer. His doctrine, which he wanted to be a realist doctrine, actually was realisticduring the period of the religion of science, of Darwinian evolutionism, of the steam engine and thetextile industry. A hundred years later, science encounters relativity, uncertainty, and chance; theeconomy must take into account electricity, metallurgy, and atomic production. The inability of pureMarxism to assimilate these successive discoveries was shared by the bourgeois optimism of Marx\'s time.It renders ridiculous the Marxist pretension of maintaining that truths one hundred years old areunalterable without ceasing to be scientific. Nineteenth-century Messianism, whether it is revolutionary orbourgeois, has not resisted the successive developments of this science and this history, which to differentdegrees they have deified.","Women naturally prefer their ideas to their sensations.","there are several ways of committing suicide, one of which is the total gift and forgetfulness of self. Don Juan, as well as anyone else, knows that this can be stirring.","In a society without anguish, it is easy to ignore death, says one of them. However, and this is the real condemnation of our society, the anguish of death is a luxury that is felt far more by the idler than by the worker, who is stifled by his own occupation. But every kind of socialism is Utopian, most of all scientific socialism. Utopia replaces God by the future. Then it proceeds to identify the future with ethics; the only values are those which serve this particular future. For that reason Utopias have almost always been coercive and authoritarian. Marx, in so far as he is a Utopian, does not differ from his frightening predecessors, and one part of his teaching more than justifies his successors.\u201d","That\'s my job in life - giving people chances.","As a result of his insistence that the individual shouldbow before the eternity of the species and should submerge himself in the great cycle of time, race hasbeen turned into a special aspect of the species, and the individual has been made to bow before thissordid god. The life of which he spoke with fear and trembling has been degraded to a sort of biology fordomestic use. Finally, a race of vulgar overlords, with a blundering desire for power, adopted, in hisname, the \\"anti-Semitic deformity\\" on which he never ceased to pour scorn.","I brought off everything I set my hand to, I moved at ease in the field of the intellect, I got on excellently with women, and if I had occasional qualms, they passed as lightly as they came.","What distinguishes consciousness of selffrom the world of nature is not the simple act of contemplation by which it identifies itself with theexterior world and finds oblivion, but the desire it can feel with regard to the world. This desire reestablishesits identity when it demonstrates that the exterior world is something apart. In its desire, theexterior world consists of what it does not possess, but which nevertheless exists, and of what it wouldlike to exist but which no longer does. Consciousness of self is therefore, of necessity, desire. But in orderto exist it must be satisfied, and it can only be satisfied by the gratification of its desire. It therefore acts inorder to gratify itself and, in so doing, it denies and suppresses its means of gratification. It is the epitomeof negation. To act is to destroy in order to give birth to the spiritual reality of consciousness. But todestroy an object unconsciously, as meat is destroyed, for example, in the act of eating, is a purely animalactivity. To consume is not yet to be conscious. Desire for consciousness must be directed towardsomething other than unconscious nature. The only thing in the world that is distinct from nature is,precisely, self-consciousness. Therefore desire must be centered upon another form of desire; selfconsciousnessmust be gratified by another form of self-consciousness. In simple words, man is notrecognized\u2014and does not recognize himself\u2014as a man as long as he limits himself to subsisting like ananimal. He must be acknowledged by other men. All consciousness is, basically, the desire to berecognized and proclaimed as such by other consciousnesses. It is others who beget us. Only inassociation do we receive a human value, as distinct from an animal value.","...everthing is true and nothing is true!","There is no noble love but that which recognizes itself to be both short-lived and exceptional","\u0648\u0647\u0630\u0627 \u0627\u0644\u062c\u0648\u0627\u0628 \u0642\u062f\u064a\u0645 \u0642\u062f\u0645 \u0627\u0644\u0627\u0646\u0633\u0627\u0646 \u0627\u0646\u0647 \u064a\u062f\u0639\u064a \u0628\u0627\u0644\u062b\u0623\u0631. \u0645\u0646 \u0623\u0633\u0627\u0621 \u0625\u0644\u064a \u064a\u062c\u0628 \u0623\u0646 \u064a\u0646\u0627\u0644\u0647 \u0633\u0648\u0621\u060c \u0648\u0645\u0646 \u0641\u0642\u0623 \u0639\u064a\u0646 \u064a\u062c\u0628 \u0623\u0646 \u064a\u0635\u0628\u062d \u0623\u0639\u0648\u0631\u060c \u0648\u0645\u062e\u0646 \u0642\u062a\u0644 \u064a\u0646\u0628\u063a\u064a \u0627\u0646 \u064a\u0645\u0648\u062a. \u0641\u0627\u0644\u0642\u0636\u064a\u0629 \u0642\u0636\u064a\u0629 \u0639\u0627\u0637\u0641\u0629\u060c \u0639\u0627\u0637\u0641\u0629 \u0639\u0646\u064a\u0641\u0629 \u062c\u062f\u0627, \u0644\u0627 \u0642\u0636\u064a\u0629 \u0645\u0628\u062f\u0623. \u0625\u0646 \u0627\u0644\u062b\u0623\u0631 \u064a\u0645\u062a \u0628\u0646\u0648\u0639\u064a\u0647 \u0625\u0644\u064a \u0627\u0644\u0637\u0628\u064a\u0639\u0629 \u0648\u0627\u0644\u063a\u0631\u064a\u0632\u0629 \u0648\u0644\u0627 \u064a\u0645\u062a \u0628\u0647\u0627 \u0625\u0644\u064a \u0627\u0644\u0634\u0631\u064a\u0639\u0629.\u0625\u0646 \u0627\u0644\u0634\u0631\u064a\u0639\u0629 \u0645\u0646 \u062d\u064a\u062b \u062a\u0639\u0631\u064a\u0641\u0647\u0627\u060c \u0644\u0627 \u064a\u0645\u0643\u0646 \u0623\u0646 \u062a\u062e\u0636\u0639 \u0644\u0642\u0648\u0627\u0639\u062f \u0627\u0644\u0637\u0628\u064a\u0639\u0629 \u0646\u0641\u0633\u0647\u0627\u060c \u0648\u0625\u0646 \u0643\u0627\u0646 \u0627\u0644\u0642\u062a\u0644 \u0645\u0646 \u0637\u0628\u064a\u0639\u0629 \u0627\u0644\u0627\u0646\u0633\u0627\u0646\u060c \u0641\u0625\u0646 \u0627\u0644\u0642\u0627\u0646\u0648\u0646 \u0644\u0645 \u064a\u0633\u0646 \u0644\u062a\u0642\u0644\u064a\u062f \u0647\u0630\u0647 \u0627\u0644\u0637\u0628\u064a\u0639\u0629 \u0623\u0648 \u0646\u0633\u062e\u0647\u0627. \u0644\u0642\u062f \u0633\u0646 \u0644\u0625\u0635\u0644\u0627\u062d\u0647\u0627.\u0648\u0627\u0644\u062d\u0627\u0644, \u0625\u0646 \u0627\u0644\u062b\u0623\u0631 \u064a\u0642\u062a\u0635\u0631 \u0639\u0644\u064a \u0627\u0644\u0645\u0635\u0627\u062f\u0642\u0629 \u0639\u0644\u064a \u062d\u0631\u0643\u0629 \u0637\u0628\u064a\u0639\u064a\u0629 \u062e\u0627\u0644\u0635\u0629 \u0648\u0639\u0644\u064a \u0645\u0646\u062d\u0647\u0627 \u0642\u0648\u0629 \u0627\u0644\u0642\u0627\u0646\u0648\u0646.","Les id\xe9es sont le contraire de la pens\xe9e.","Veo que muchas personas mueren porque estiman que la vida no vale la pena vivirla.

The young girls in the flower of their youthstill laugh and chatter on the seashore, but he who watches them gradually loses his right to love them,just as those he has loved lose the power to be loved. This melancholy is the melancholy of Proust. It waspowerful enough in him to cause a violent rejection of all existence. But his passion for faces and for thelight attached him at the same time to life. He never admitted that the happy days of his youth were lostforever. He undertook the task of re-creating them and of demonstrating, in the face of death, that the pastcould be regained at the end of time in the form of an imperishable present, both truer and richer than itwas at the beginning. The psychological analysis of Remembrance of Things Past is nothing but a potentmeans to an end. The real greatness of Proust lies in having written Time Regained, which resembles theworld of dispersion and which gives it a meaning on the very level of integration. His difficult victory, onthe eve of his death, is to have been able to extract from the incessant flight of forms, by means ofmemory and intelligence alone, the tentative trembling symbols of human unity. The most definitechallenge that a work of this kind can give to creation is to present itself as an entirety, as a closed andunified world. This defines an unrepentant work of art.","He belongs to time, and by the horror that seizes him, he recognizes his worst enemy.","But Nietzsche\u2019s tragedy is found here once again. The aims, the prophecies are generous and universal, but the doctrine is restrictive, and the reduction of every value to historical terms leads to the direst consequences. Marx thought that the ends of history, at least, would prove to be moral and rational. That was his Utopia. But Utopia, at least in the form he knew it, is destined to serve cynicism, of which he wanted no part. Marx destroys all transcendence, then carries out, by himself, the transition from fact to duty. But his concept of duty has no other origin but fact. The demand for justice ends in injustice if it is not primarily based on an ethical justification of justice; without this, crime itself one day becomes a duty. When good and evil are reintegrated in time and confused with events, nothing is any longer good or bad, but only either premature or out of date. Who will decide on the opportunity, if not the opportunist? Later, say the disciples, you shall judge. But the victims will not be there to judge. For the victim, the present is the only value, rebellion the only action. Messianism, in order to exist, must construct a defense against the victims. It is possible that Marx did not want this, but in this lies his responsibility which must be examined, that he incurred by justifying, in the name of the revolution, the henceforth bloody struggle against all forms of rebellion.","Rieux knew what the old man was thinking at that moment as he wept, and the thought the same: that this world without love is like a dead world and that there always comes a time when one grows tired of prisons, work and courage, and years for the face of another human being and the wondering, affectionate heart.","Los hombres que comparten los mismos dormitorios, ya sean soldados o prisioneros, contraen un lazo extra\xf1o como si, al quitarse las armaduras con la ropa, se hermanaran cada noche, por encima de sus diferencias, en la vieja comunidad del sue\xf1o y del cansancio","Matarse, en cierto sentido, y como en el melodrama, es confesar.

But if he dies in refusingto be enslaved, he reaffirms the existence of another kind of human nature which refuses to be classifiedas an object.

If he is punished, his punishment would be a silent protest and might cause a fissure in thetotality. But the culprit is not punished, he is simply replaced in the totality and thus helps to construct themachine of Empire. He is transformed into a cog in the machinery of production, so indispensable that inthe long run he will not be used in production because he is guilty, but considered guilty becauseproduction has need of him.

If that is true, it is not because God isnever spoken of, but because the ambition of this world is to be absolute perfection and to give to eternitythe aspect of man. Time Regained, at least in its aspirations, is eternity without God. Proust\'s work, in thisregard, appears to be one of the most ambitious and most significant of man\'s enterprises against hismortal condition. He has demonstrated that the art of the novel can reconstruct creation itself, in the formthat it is imposed on us and in the form in which we reject it. In one of its aspects, at least, this art consistsin choosing the creature in preference to his creator. But still more profoundly, it is alliedto the beauty of the world or of its inhabitants against the powers of death and oblivion. It is in this waythat his rebellion is creative","No puede haber absurdo por fuera de un esp\xedritu humano.

If, by some chance, one of us tried to unburden himself or to say something about his feelings, the reply he got, whatever it might be, usually wounded him. And then it dawned on him that he and the man with him weren\'t talking about the same thing. For while he himself spoke from the depths of long days of brooding upon his personal distress, and the image he had tried to impart had been slowly shaped and proved in the fires of passion and regret, this meant nothing to the man to whom he was speaking, who pictured a conventional emotion, a grief that is traded on the market-place, mass-produced.

His exile is without remedy since he is deprived of the memory of a lost home or the hope of a promised land.

Guided by a determinist hypothesisthat calculates the weak points and the degree of elasticity of the soul, these new techniques have onceagain thrust aside one of man\'s limits and have attempted to demonstrate that no individual psychology isoriginal and that the common measure of all human character is matter. They have literally created thephysics of the soul.","Si je me demande \xe0 quoi juger que telle question est plus pressante que telle autre, je r\xe9ponds que c\'est aux actions qu\'elles engage.","There, too, in that Home where lives were flickering out, the dusk came as a mournful solace.

The unequal opportunities of different lands,the more or less rapid improvements in the means of production, and the struggle for life have rapidlycreated social inequalities that have been crystallized into antagonisms between production anddistribution; and consequently into class struggles. These struggles and antagonisms are the motive powerof history. Slavery in ancient times and feudal bondage were stages on a long road that led to theartisanship of the classical centuries when the producer was master of the means of production. At thismoment the opening of world trade routes and the discovery of new outlets demanded a less provincialform of production. The contradiction between the method of production and the new demands ofdistribution already announces the end of the regime of small-scale agricultural and industrial production.The industrial revolution, theinvention of steam appliances, and competition for outlets inevitably led to the expropriation of the smallproprietor and to the introduction of large-scale production. The means of production are thenconcentrated in the hands of those who are able to buy them; the real producers, the workers, now onlydispose of the strength of their arms, which can be sold to the \\"man with the money.\\" Thus bourgeoiscapitalism is defined by the separation of the producer from the means of production.

This double movement first of all hastens the ruin of the middleclasses, who are absorbed into the proletariat, and then proceeds to concentrate, in an increasingly smallnumber of hands, the riches produced uniquely by the proletariat. Thus the proletariat increases in size inproportion to its increasing ruin. Capital is now concentrated in the hands of only a very few masters,whose growing power is based on robbery. Moreover, these masters are shaken to their foundations bysuccessive crises, overwhelmed by the contradictions of the system, and can no longer assure even meresubsistence to their slaves, who then come to depend on private or public charity.

The proletariat \\"can and mustaccept the bourgeois revolution as a condition of the working-class revolution.","As they left, the girls were choking with laughter, but once they reached Mersault\'s house and the cool shade of the rooms, which emphasized the dazzling whiteness of the sun-drenched garden walls, they discovered a silent harmony that Catherine expressed by the desire to take a sunbath on the terrace.","\u062f\u0631 \u0627\u0646\u062a\u0647\u0627\u06cc \u0627\u06cc\u0646 \u062f\u0648\u0631\u0627\u0646 \u062f\u0631\u0627\u0632 \u062c\u062f\u0627\u06cc\u06cc\u060c \u062f\u06cc\u06af\u0631 \u062a\u0635\u0648\u0631\u0627\u0646 \u0645\u062d\u0631\u0648\u0645\u06cc\u062a\u06cc \u0631\u0627 \u06a9\u0647 \u0645\u062a\u0639\u0644\u0642 \u0628\u0647 \u062e\u0648\u062f\u0634\u0627\u0646 \u0628\u0648\u062f \u0646\u0645\u06cc\u200c\u06a9\u0631\u062f\u0646\u062f \u0648 \u0646\u0645\u06cc\u200c\u062f\u0627\u0646\u0633\u062a\u0646\u062f \u0686\u06af\u0648\u0646\u0647 \u062f\u0631 \u06a9\u0646\u0627\u0631\u0634\u0627\u0646 \u0645\u0648\u062c\u0648\u062f \u0645\u06cc\u200c\u0632\u06cc\u0633\u062a \u06a9\u0647 \u0647\u0631\u0644\u062d\u0638\u0647 \u0645\u06cc\u200c\u062a\u0648\u0627\u0646\u0633\u062a\u0646\u062f \u0644\u0645\u0633\u0634 \u06a9\u0646\u0646\u062f. \u0627\u0632 \u0639\u0634\u0642\u0634\u0627\u0646 \u0641\u0642\u0637 \u0627\u0634\u0628\u0627\u062d\u06cc \u0628\u0631\u0627\u06cc \u0622\u0646\u200c\u0647\u0627 \u0628\u0627\u0642\u06cc\u200c\u0645\u0627\u0646\u062f\u0647 \u0628\u0648\u062f \u06a9\u0647 \u0631\u0648\u0632\u0628\u0647\u200c\u0631\u0648\u0632 \u0646\u062d\u06cc\u0641\u200c\u062a\u0631 \u0645\u06cc\u200c\u0634\u062f\u0646\u062f.","Sade\u2019s success in our day is explained by the dream that he had in common with contemporary thought: the demand for total freedom, and dehumanization coldly planned by the intelligence. The reduction of man to an object of experiment, the rule that specifies the relation between the will to power and man as an object, the sealed laboratory that is the scene of this monstrous experiment, are lessons which the theoreticians of power will discover again when they come to organizing the age of slavery.Two centuries ahead of time and on a reduced scale, Sade extolled totalitarian societies in the name of unbridled freedom\u2014which, in reality, rebellion does not demand. The history and the tragedy of our times really begin with him. He only believed that a society founded on freedom of crime must coincide with freedom of morals, as though servitude had its limits. Our times have limited themselves to blending, in a curious manner, his dream of a universal republic and his technique of degradation. Finally, what he hated most, legal murder, has availed itself of the discoveries that he wanted to put to the service of instinctive murder. Crime, which he wanted to be the exotic and delicious fruit of unbridled vice, is no more today than the dismal habit of a police-controlled morality. Such are the surprises of literature.","To-day the truth is a command","This was the second time the doctor had glimpsed something of Mersault\'s life; they had never confided in each other, Mersault conscious that Bernard was not a happy man, and Bernard rather baffled by Mersault\'s way of life.

The logic ofhistory, from the moment that it is totally accepted, gradually leads it, against its most passionateconvictions, to mutilate man more and more and to transform itself into objective crime. It is notlegitimate to identify the ends of Fascism with the ends of Russian Communism. The first represents theexaltation of the executioner by the executioner; the second, more dramaticin concept, the exaltation of the executioner by the victims. The former never dreamed of liberating allmen, but only of liberating a few by subjugating the rest.

A pestilence does not have human dimensions, so people tell themselves that it is unreal, that it is a bad dream which will end. But it does not always end, from one bad dream to the next, it is people who end, humanists first of all because they have not prepared themselves. The people of our town were no more guilty than anyone else, they merely forgot to be modest and thought that everything was still possible for them, which implied that pestilence was impossible. They continued with business, with making arrangements for travel and holding opinions. Why should they have thought about the plague, which negates the future, negates journeys and debate? They considered themselves free and no one will ever be free as long as there is plague, pestilence and famine.","When a slave rebels against his master, the situation presented is of one man pitted against another, undera cruel sky, far from the exalted realms of principles. The final result is merely the murder of a man. Theservile rebellions, peasant risings, beggar outbreaks, rustic revolts, all advance the concept of a principleof equality, a life for a life, which despite every kind of mystification and audacity will always be foundin the purest manifestations of the revolutionary spirit-","I would make another effort to divert my thoughts. I would listen to my heartbeat. I couldn\'t imagine that this sound which had been with me for so long could ever stop. I\'ve never really had much of an imagination.

The blood of the gods, which for asecond bespatters the confessor of Louis XVI, announces a new baptism. Joseph de Maistre qualified theRevolution as satanic. We can see why and in what sense. Michelet, however, was closer to the truthwhen he called it a purgatory.

If the general will is freelyexpressed, it can only be the universal expression of reason. If the people are free, they are infallible.Once the King is dead, andthe chains of the old despotism thrown off, the people are going to express what, at all times and in allplaces, is, has been, and will be the truth. They are the oracle that must be consulted to know what theeternal order of the world demands. Vox populi, vox naturae. Eternal principles govern our conduct:Truth, Justice, finally Reason. There we have the new God. The Supreme Being, whom cohorts of younggirls come to adore at the Feast of Reason, is only the ancient god disembodied, peremptorily deprived ofany connection with the earth, and launched like a balloon into a heaven empty of all transcendentprinciples. Deprived of all his representatives, of any intercessor, the god of the lawyers and philosophersonly has the value of a demonstration. He is not very strong, in fact, and we can see why Rousseau, whopreached tolerance, thought that atheists should be condemned to death. To ensure the adoration of atheorem for any length of time, faith is not enough; a police force is needed as well. But that will onlycome later. In 1793 the new faith is still intact, and it will suffice, to take Saint-Just\'s word, to governaccording to the dictates of reason. The art of ruling, according to him, has produced only monstersbecause, before his time, no one wished to govern according to nature. The period of monsters has cometo an end with the termination of the period of violence. \\"The human heart advances from nature toviolence, from violence to morality.\\" Morality is, therefore, only nature finally restored after centuries ofalienation. Man only has to be given law \\"in accord with nature and with his heart,\\" and he will cease tobe unhappy and corrupt.

When one has once had the good luck to love intensely, life is spent in trying to recapture that ardor and that illumination. Forsaking beauty and the sensual happiness attached to it, exclusively serving misfortune, calls for a nobility I lack. But, after all, nothing is true that forces one to exclude. Isolated beauty ends up simpering; solitary justice ends up oppressing. Whoever aims to serve one exclusive of the other serves no one, not even himself, and eventually serves injustice twice. A day comes when, thanks to rigidity, nothing causes wonder any more, everything is known, and life is spent in beginning over again. These are the days of exile, of desiccated life, of dead souls. To come alive again, one needs a special grace, self-forgetfulness, or a homeland. Certain mornings, on turning a corner, a delightful dew falls on the heart and then evaporates. But its coolness remains, and this is what the heart requires always.","More precisely, it is a question of dissolving contradictions in the fires of love and desire and of demolishing the walls of death.

If surrealism did not change the world, it furnished it with a few strange myths which partly justified Nietzsche\u2019s announcement of the return of the Greeks. Only partly, because he was referring to unenlightened Greece, the Greece of mysteries and dark gods. Finally, just as Nietzsche\u2019s experience culminated in the acceptance of the light of day, surrealist experience culminates in the exaltation of the darkness of night, the agonized and obstinate cult of the tempest. Breton, according to his own statements, understood that, despite everything, life was a gift. But his compliance could never shed the full light of day, the light that all of us need.","A partir d\u2019aujourd\u2019hui, vous allez apprendre \xe0 mourir, dans l\u2019ordre.

Figures floated across his memory, and he recalled that some thirty or so great plagues known to history had accounted for nearly a hundred million deaths. But what are a hundred million deaths? When one has served in a war, one hardly knows what a dead man is, after a while. And since a dead man has no substance unless one has actually seen him dead, a hundred million corpses broadcast through history are no more than a puff of smoke in the imagination.","Para el que ama el modo de emplear el tiempo del amado es el manantial de todas sus alegr\xedas.","Yes, there was suspicion in the eyes of all. Obviously, they were thinking, there must be some good reason for the isolation inflicted on them, and they had the air of people who are puzzling over their problem and are afraid. Everyone Tarrou set eyes on had that vacant gaze and was visibly suffering from the complete break with all that life had meant to him. And since they could not be thinking of their death all the time, they thought of nothing. They were on vacation. \u201cBut worst of all, Tarrou writes, \u201cis that they\u2019re forgotten, and they know it. Their friends have forgotten them because they have other things to think about, naturally enough. And those they love have forgotten them because all their energies are devoted to making schemes and taking steps to get them out of the camp. And by dint of always thinking about these schemes and steps they have ceased thinking about those whose release they\u2019re trying to secure. And that, too, is natural enough. In fact, it comes to this: nobody is capable of really thinking about anyone, even in the worst calamity. For really to think about someone means thinking about that person every minute of the day, without letting one\u2019s thoughts be diverted by anything, by meals, by a fly that settles on one\u2019s cheek, by household duties, or by a sudden itch somewhere.

That represents a hesitation perhaps. But it is the hesitation of nihilism and the real progress of rebellion. After all, when he could not give himself the morality and the values of whose necessity he was clearly aware, we know very well that Breton chose love.","...each of us has the plague within him; no one, no one on earth is free from it.

In the eyes of the rebel, what is missing from the misery of the world, as well as from its moments of happiness, is some principle by which they can be explained. The insurrection against evil is, above all, a demand for unity. The rebel obstinately confronts a world condemned to death and the impenetrable obscurity of the human condition with his demand for life and absolute clarity. He is seeking, without knowing it, a moral philosophy or a religion. Rebellion, even though it is blind, is a form of asceticism. Therefore, if the rebel blasphemes, it is in the hope of finding a new god.","Mothers and children, lovers, husbands and wives, who had a few days previously taken it for granted that their parting would be a short one, who had kissed one another good-by on the platform and exchanged a few trivial remarks, sure as they were of seeing one another again after a few days or, at most, a few weeks, duped by our blind human faith in the near future and little if at all diverted from their normal interests by this leavetaking, all these people found themselves, without the least warning, hopelessly cut off, prevented from seeing one another again, or even communicating with one another.","The spirit of revolt can only exist in a society where a theoretic equality conceals great factual inequalities.

Their only evident victory is to triumph at least over solitude and negation. In the midst of a world which they deny and which rejects them, they try, man after man, like all the great-hearted ones, to reconstruct a brotherhood of man. The love they bear for one another, which brings them happiness even in the desert of a prison, which extends to the great mass of their enslaved and silent fellow men, gives the measure of their distress and of their hopes. To serve this love, they must first kill; to inaugurate the reign of innocence, they must accept a certain culpability. This contradiction will be resolved for them only at the very last moment. Solitude and chivalry, renunciation and hope will only be surmounted by the willing acceptance of death.","Entonces comprend\xedamos que nuestra separaci\xf3n ten\xeda que durar y que no nos quedaba m\xe1s remedio que reconciliarnos con el tiempo.","The day before Castel called on Rieux, M.

He exceeds the bounds that he established for his antagonist and demands that he should now be treated as an equal.

But it is obvious that the knowledge he gains is of an \u2018All\u2019 that is still rather obscure and of a \u2018Nothing\u2019 that proclaims the possibility of sacrificing the rebel to this \u2018All\u2019.

But, now they had abruptly become aware that they were undergoing a sort of incarceration under that blue dome of sky, already beginning to sizzle in the fires of summer, they had a vague sensation that their whole lives were threatened by the present turn of events, and in the evening, when the cooler air revived their energy, this feeling of being locked in like criminals prompted them sometimes to foolhardy acts.","Quand je regarde ma vie et sa couleur secr\xe8te, j\'ai en moi comme un tremblement de larmes.","La estupidez insiste siempre, uno se dar\xeda cuenta de ello si uno no pensara siempre en s\xed mismo.","It is as reasonable to represent one kind of imprisonment by another,","He would be expressing himself from the depths of long days of meditation and suffering, the image that he wanted to communicate having been long tempered in the fire of waiting and passion. The other person, meanwhile, imagined a conventional emotion, the suffering that is hawked around the marketplace, a mass-produced melancholy. Whether well-meant or not, the reply would always strike the wrong note and have to be abandoned. Or at least for those to whom silence was unbearable; since others could not find the true language of the heart, they resigned themselves to using the language of the market-place and themselves speaking in a conventional manner, that of the simple account or newspaper report, which is to some extent that of the daily chronicle of events. Here too, the most authentic sufferings were habitually translated into the banal cliches of conversation. It was only at this price that the prisoners of the plague could obtain compassion from their concierges or gain the interest of their audience.","In truth, it is a quarrel they are going to settle. But it is one that for the past hundred of years has mortally separated Algiers and Oran. Back in history, these two North African towns would have already bled each other white as Pisa and Florence did in happier times. Their rivalry is all the stronger just because it probably has no basis. Having every reason to like each other, they loathe each other proportionally.","Thus, too, they came to know the incorrigible sorrow of all prisoners and exiles, which is to live in company with a memory that serves no purpose.","Men die:and they are not happy.","Mais le bien public est fait du bonheur de chacun.","\u0434\u043e\u043a\u0442\u043e\u0440 \u0420\u0438\u044d \u0440\u0435\u0448\u0438\u043b \u043d\u0430\u043f\u0438\u0441\u0430\u0442\u044c \u044d\u0442\u0443 \u0438\u0441\u0442\u043e\u0440\u0438\u044e, \u043a\u043e\u0442\u043e\u0440\u0430\u044f \u043e\u043a\u0430\u043d\u0447\u0438\u0432\u0430\u0435\u0442\u0441\u044f \u0437\u0434\u0435\u0441\u044c, \u043d\u0430\u043f\u0438\u0441\u0430\u0442\u044c \u0434\u043b\u044f \u0442\u043e\u0433\u043e, \u0447\u0442\u043e\u0431\u044b \u043d\u0435 \u0443\u043f\u043e\u0434\u043e\u0431\u0438\u0442\u044c\u0441\u044f \u043c\u043e\u043b\u0447\u0430\u043b\u044c\u043d\u0438\u043a\u0430\u043c, \u0441\u0432\u0438\u0434\u0435\u0442\u0435\u043b\u044c\u0441\u0442\u0432\u043e\u0432\u0430\u0442\u044c \u0432 \u043f\u043e\u043b\u044c\u0437\u0443 \u0437\u0430\u0447\u0443\u043c\u043b\u0435\u043d\u043d\u044b\u0445, \u0447\u0442\u043e\u0431\u044b \u0445\u043e\u0442\u044c \u043f\u0430\u043c\u044f\u0442\u044c \u043e\u0441\u0442\u0430\u0432\u0438\u0442\u044c \u043e \u043d\u0435\u0441\u043f\u0440\u0430\u0432\u0435\u0434\u043b\u0438\u0432\u043e\u0441\u0442\u0438 \u0438 \u043d\u0430\u0441\u0438\u043b\u0438\u0438, \u0441\u043e\u0432\u0435\u0440\u0448\u0435\u043d\u043d\u044b\u0445 \u043d\u0430\u0434 \u043d\u0438\u043c\u0438, \u0434\u0430 \u043f\u0440\u043e\u0441\u0442\u043e \u0434\u043b\u044f \u0442\u043e\u0433\u043e, \u0447\u0442\u043e\u0431\u044b \u0441\u043a\u0430\u0437\u0430\u0442\u044c \u043e \u0442\u043e\u043c, \u0447\u0435\u043c\u0443 \u0443\u0447\u0438\u0442 \u0442\u0435\u0431\u044f \u0433\u043e\u0434\u0438\u043d\u0430 \u0431\u0435\u0434\u0441\u0442\u0432\u0438\u0439: \u0435\u0441\u0442\u044c \u0431\u043e\u043b\u044c\u0448\u0435 \u043e\u0441\u043d\u043e\u0432\u0430\u043d\u0438\u0439 \u0432\u043e\u0441\u0445\u0438\u0449\u0430\u0442\u044c\u0441\u044f \u043b\u044e\u0434\u044c\u043c\u0438, \u0447\u0435\u043c \u043f\u0440\u0435\u0437\u0438\u0440\u0430\u0442\u044c \u0438\u0445","Esta era la evidencia.

It was one of those bits of refuse that ships leave behind them. Yet I had not been able to endure watching it; for I had thought at once of a drowning person. Then I realized, as calmly as you resign yourself to the idea the truth of which you have long known, that that cry which had sounded over the Seine behind me years before had never ceased, carried by the river to the waters of the Channel, to travel throughout the world, across the limitless expanse of the ocean, and that it had waited for me there until the day I had encountered it. I realized likewise that it would continue to await me on seas and rivers, everywhere, in short where lies the bitter water of my baptism. Here, too, by the way, aren\'t we on the water? On this flat, monotonous, interminable water whose limits are indistinguishable from those of the land? Is it credible that we shall ever reach Amsterdam? We shall never get out of this immense holy-water font. Listen. Don\'t you hear the cries of invisible gulls? If they are crying in our direction, to what are they calling us?But they are the same gulls that were crying, that were already calling over the Atlantic the day I realized definitively that I was not cured, that I was still cornered and that I had to make shift with it. Ended the glorious life, but ended also the frenzy and the convulsions. I had to submit and admit my guilt.

But, besides the reasons that have been very well explained to us for the past two thousand years, there was a major one for that terrible agony, and I don\'t know why it has been so carefully hidden. The real reason is that *he* knew he was not altogether innocent. If he did not bear the weight of the crime he was accused of, he had committed others - even thought he didn\'t know which ones. Did he really not know them? He was at the source, after all; he must have heard of a certain Slaughter of the Innocents. The children of Judea massacred while his parents were taking him to a safe place - why did they die if not because of him? Those blood-splattered soldiers, those infants cut in two filled him with horror. But given the man he was, I am sure he could not forget them.

The absurdity peculiar to this problem comes from the fact that the very notion that makes the problem of freedom possible also takes away all its meaning. For in the presence of God there is less a problem of freedom than a problem of evil. You know the alternative: either we are not free and God the all-powerful is responsible for evil. Or we are free and responsible but God is not all-powerful. All the scholastic subtleties have neither added anything to nor subtracted anything from the acuteness of this paradox.

The narrator does not share this view. The evil in the world comes almost always from ignorance, and goodwill can cause as much damage as ill-will if it is not enlightened. People are more often good than bad, though in fact that is not the question. But they are more or less ignorant and this is what one calls vice or virtue, the most appalling vice being the ignorance that thinks it knows everything and which consequently authorizes itself to kill.

Russian Communism, by its violent criticism of every kind of formal virtue, puts the finishing touches to the revolutionary work of the nineteenth century by denying any superior principle.

The Jacobin Revolution, which tried to institute the religion of virtue in order to establish unity upon it, will be followed by the cynical revolutions, which can be either of the right or of the left and which will try to achieve the unity of the world so as to found, at last, the religion of man.

It aims to enumerate what it cannot transcend. It affirms solely that without any unifying principle thought can still take delight in describing and understanding every aspect of experience. The truth involved then for each of those aspects is psychological in nature. It simply testifies to the \u2018interest\u2019 that reality can offer. It is a way of awaking a sleeping world and of making it vivid to the mind.

Our townsfolk were not more to blame than others; they forgot to be modest, that was all, and thought that everything still was possible for them; which presupposed that pestilences were impossible.

We cannot blame a man for lacking what it was never in his power to acquire. But in a criminal court the wholly passive ideal of tolerance must give place to a sterner, loftier ideal, that of justice. Especially when this lack of every decent instinct is such as that of the man before you, a menace to society.\u201d He proceeded to discuss my conduct toward my mother, repeating what he had said in the course of the hearing. But he spoke at much greater length of my crime\u2014 at such length, indeed, that I lost the thread and was conscious only of the steadily increasing heat.\u201d","A profound thought is in a constant state of becoming; it adopts the experience of a life and assumes its shape","But one day the \u201cwhy arises and everything begins in that weariness tinged with amazement. \u201cBegins\u201d\u2014this is important. Weariness comes at the end of the acts of a mechanical life, but at the same time it inaugurates the impulse of consciousness. It awakens consciousness and provokes what follows. What follows is the gradual return into the chain or it is the definitive awakening. At the end of the awakening comes, in time, the consequence: suicide or recovery. In itself weariness has something sickening about it. Here, I must conclude that it is good. For everything begins with consciousness and nothing is worth anything except through it.\u201d","And, in a very definite way, this misfortune which had come from outside and befallen a whole town did more than inflict on us an unmerited distress with which we might well be indignant. It also incited us to create our own suffering and thus to accept frustration as a natural state. This was one of the tricks the pestilence had of diverting attention and confounding issues.","\xabTout \xe0 l\'air si compliqu\xe9. Tout est si simple pourtant.

That nostalgia for unity, that appetite for the absolute illustrates the essential impulse for the human drama. But the fact of that nostalgia\u2019s existence does not imply that it is to be immediately satisfied. For if, bridging the gulf that separates desire from conquest, we assert with Parmenides the reality of the One (whatever it may be) we fall into the ridiculous contradiction of a mind that asserts total unity and proves by its very assertion its own difference and the diversity it claimed to resolve. This other vicious circle is enough to stifle our hopes.","it is easier to deduce from the act itself the consequences it implies. In a sense, and as in melodrama, killing yourself amounts to confessing. It is confessing that life is too much for you or that you do not understand it. Let\u2019s not go too far in such analogies, however, but rather return to everyday words. It is merely confessing that that \u201cis not worth the trouble. Living, naturally, is never easy. You continue making the gestures commanded by existence for many reasons, the first of which is habit.
