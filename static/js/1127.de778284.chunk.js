It means deciding to voluntarily transform the chaos of potential into the realities of habitable order. It means adopting the burden of self-conscious vulnerability, and accepting the end of the unconscious paradise of childhood, where finitude and mortality are only dimly comprehended. It means willingly undertaking the sacrifices necessary to generate a productive and meaningful reality (it means acting to please God, in the ancient language).","When you have something to say, silence is a lie.","You\'re going to pay a price for every bloody thing you do and everything you don\'t do. You don\'t get to choose to not pay a price. You get to choose which poison you\'re going to take. That\'s it.","You can only find out what you actually believe (rather than what you think you believe) by watching how you act. You simply don\u2019t know what you believe, before that. You are too complex to understand yourself.","If you can\'t understand why someone is doing something, look at the consequences of their actions, whatever they might be, and then infer the motivations from their consequences. For example if someone is making everyone around them miserable and you\'d like to know why, their motive may simply be to make everyone around them miserable including themselves.","If you don\'t say what you think then you kill your unborn self.","What is your friend: the things you know, or the things you don\'t know. First of all, there\'s a lot more things you don\'t know. And second, the things you don\'t know is the birthplace of all your new knowledge! So if you make the things you don\'t know your friend, rather than the things you know, well then you\'re always on a quest in a sense. You\'re always looking for new information in the off chance that somebody who doesn\'t agree with you will tell you something you couldn\'t have figured out on your own! It\'s a completely different way of looking at the world. It\'s the antithesis of opinionated.","And if you think tough men are dangerous, wait until you see what weak men are capable of.","If you fulfill your obligations everyday you don\'t need to worry about the future.","Life is suffering Love is the desire to see unnecessary suffering amelioratedTruth is the handmaiden of loveDialogue is the pathway to truth Humility is recognition of personal insufficiency and the willingness to learn To learn is to die voluntarily and be born again, in great ways and smallSo speech must be untrammeled So that dialogue can take placeSo that we can all humbly learn So that truth can serve loveSo that suffering can be amelioratedSo that we can all stumble forward to the Kingdom of God","It took untold generations to get you where you are. A little gratitude might be in order. If you\'re going to insist on bending the world to your way, you better have your reasons.","Women select men. That makes them nature, because nature is what selects. And you can say \\"Well it\'s only symbolic that women are nature\\", it\'s like no, it\'s not just symbolic. The woman is the gatekeeper to reproductive success. And you can\'t get more like nature than that, in fact it\'s the very definition of nature.","No tree can grow to Heaven, adds the ever-terrifying Carl Gustav Jung, psychoanalyst extraordinaire, \u201cunless its roots reach down to Hell.\u201d","Intolerance of others\u2019 views (no matter how ignorant or incoherent they may be) is not simply wrong; in a world where there is no right or wrong, it is worse: it is a sign you are embarrassingly unsophisticated or, possibly, dangerous.","To suffer terribly and to know yourself as the cause: that is Hell.","Don\u2019t underestimate the power of vision and direction. These are irresistible forces, able to transform what might appear to be unconquerable obstacles into traversable pathways and expanding opportunities. Strengthen the individual. Start with yourself. Take care with yourself. Define who you are. Refine your personality. Choose your destination and articulate your Being. As the great nineteenth-century German philosopher Friedrich Nietzsche so brilliantly noted, \u201cHe whose life has a why can bear almost any how.","So, attend carefully to your posture. Quit drooping and hunching around. Speak your mind. Put your desires forward, as if you had a right to them\u2014at least the same right as others. Walk tall and gaze forthrightly ahead. Dare to be dangerous. Encourage the serotonin to flow plentifully through the neural pathways desperate for its calming influence.","The purpose of life, as far as I can tell\u2026 is to find a mode of being that\u2019s so meaningful that the fact that life is suffering is no longer relevant.","Ideologies are substitutes for true knowledge, and ideologues are always dangerous when they come to power, because a simple-minded I-know-it-all approach is no match for the complexity of existence.","RULE 4 COMPARE YOURSELF TO WHO YOU WERE YESTERDAY, NOT TO WHO SOMEONE ELSE IS TODAY","Perhaps you are overvaluing what you don\u2019t have and undervaluing what you do.","You must determine where you are going in your life, because you cannot get there unless you move in that direction. Random wandering will not move you forward. It will instead disappoint and frustrate you and make you anxious and unhappy and hard to get along with (and then resentful, and then vengeful, and then worse).","If you are not willing to be a fool, you can\'t become a master.","Compare yourself to who you were yesterday, not to who someone else is today.","In the West, we have been withdrawing from our tradition-, religion- and even nation-centred cultures, partly to decrease the danger of group conflict. But we are increasingly falling prey to the desperation of meaninglessness, and that is no improvement at all.","Sometimes, when people have a low opinion of their own worth\u2014or, perhaps, when they refuse responsibility for their lives\u2014they choose a new acquaintance, of precisely the type who proved troublesome in the past. Such people don\u2019t believe that they deserve any better\u2014so they don\u2019t go looking for it. Or, perhaps, they don\u2019t want the trouble of better. Freud called this a \u201crepetition compulsion. He thought of it as an unconscious drive to repeat the horrors of the past\u2014sometimes, perhaps, to formulate those horrors more precisely, sometimes to attempt more active mastery and sometimes, perhaps, because no alternatives beckon. People create their worlds with the tools they have directly at hand. Faulty tools produce faulty results. Repeated use of the same faulty tools produces the same faulty results. It is in this manner that those who fail to learn from the past doom themselves to repeat it. It\u2019s partly fate. It\u2019s partly inability. It\u2019s partly \u2026 unwillingness to learn? Refusal to learn? Motivated refusal to learn?\u201d","We deserve some respect. You deserve some respect. You are important to other people, as much as to yourself. You have some vital role to play in the unfolding destiny of the world. You are, therefore, morally obliged to take care of yourself. You should take care of, help and be good to yourself the same way you would take care of, help and be good to someone you loved and valued. You may therefore have to conduct yourself habitually in a manner that allows you some respect for your own Being\u2014and fair enough. But every person is deeply flawed. Everyone falls short of the glory of God. If that stark fact meant, however, that we had no responsibility to care, for ourselves as much as others, everyone would be brutally punished all the time. That would not be good. That would make the shortcomings of the world, which can make everyone who thinks honestly question the very propriety of the world, worse in every way. That simply cannot be the proper path forward.","In order to be able to think, you have to risk being offensive.","If you have a comprehensive explanation for everything then it decreases uncertainty and anxiety and reduces your cognitive load. And if you can use that simplifying algorithm to put yourself on the side of moral virtue then you\u2019re constantly a good person with a minimum of effort.","You cannot be protected from the things that frighten you and hurt you, but if you identify with the part of your being that is responsible for transformation, then you aare always the equal, or more than the equal of the things that frighten you.","The better ambitions have to do with the development of character and ability, rather than status and power. Status you can lose. You carry character with you wherever you go, and it allows you to prevail against adversity.","Order is not enough. You can\u2019t just be stable, and secure, and unchanging, because there are still vital and important new things to be learned. Nonetheless, chaos can be too much. You can\u2019t long tolerate being swamped and overwhelmed beyond your capacity to cope while you are learning what you still need to know. Thus, you need to place one foot in what you have mastered and understood and the other in what you are currently exploring and mastering. Then you have positioned yourself where the terror of existence is under control and you are secure, but where you are also alert and engaged. That is where there is something new to master and some way that you can be improved. That is where meaning is to be found.","Of course, my socialist colleagues and I weren\u2019t out to hurt anyone \u2013 quite the reverse. We were out to improve things \u2013 but we were going to start with other people. I came to see the temptation in this logic, the obvious flaw, the danger \u2013 but could also see that it did not exclusively characterize socialism. Anyone who was out to change the world by changing others was to be regarded with suspicion. The temptations of such a position were too great to be resisted.","You don\'t get to choose not to pay a price, you only get to choose which price you pay","Every bit of learning is a little death. Every bit of new information challenges a previous conception, forcing it to dissolve into chaos before it can be reborn as something better. Sometimes such deaths virtually destroy us.","So, listen, to yourself and to those with whom you are speaking. Your wisdom then consists not of the knowledge you already have, but the continual search for knowledge, which is the highest form of wisdom.","The successful among us delay gratification. The successful among us bargain with the future.","Nietzsche said that a man\u2019s worth was determined by how much truth he could tolerate","Always place your becoming above your current being.","There are some games you don\'t get to play unless you are all in.","People organize their brains with conversation. If they don\'t have anyone to tell their story to, they lose their minds. Like hoarders, they cannot unclutter themselves.","It is my firm belief that the best way to fix the world\u2014a handyman\u2019s dream, if ever there was one\u2014is to fix yourself,","If your life is not what it could be, try telling the truth. If you cling desperately to an ideology, or wallow in nihilism, try telling the truth. If you feel weak and rejected, and desperate, and confused, try telling the truth. In Paradise, everyone speaks the truth. That is what makes it Paradise. Tell the truth. Or, at least, don\u2019t lie.","Stop saying those things that make you weak and ashamed. Say only those things that make you strong. Do only those things that you could speak of with honour.","We require routine and tradition. That\u2019s order. Order can become excessive, and that\u2019s not good, but chaos can swamp us, so we drown\u2014 and that is also not good. We need to stay on the straight and narrow path.","Rejection of the unknown is tantamount to \u201cidentification with the devil, the mythological counterpart and eternal adversary of the world-creating exploratory hero. Such rejection and identification is a consequence of Luciferian pride, which states: all that I know is all that is necessary to know. This pride is totalitarian assumption of omniscience \u2013 is adoption of \u201cGod\u2019s place\u201d by \u201creason\u201d \u2013 is something that inevitably generates a state of personal and social being indistinguishable from hell. This hell develops because creative exploration \u2013 impossible, without (humble) acknowledgment of the unknown \u2013 constitutes the process that constructs and maintains the protective adaptive structure that gives life much of its acceptable meaning\u201d","The things that pose the greatest threats to your survival are the most real things.","The secret to your existence is right in front of you. It manifests itself as all those things you know you should do, but are avoiding.","Don\u2019t ever underestimate the destructive power of sins of omission.","Consciousness is a mystery that faces the mystery of potential and transforms it into actuality. We do that with every choice we make. Our choices determine the destiny of the world. By making a choice, you alter the structure of reality.","We believe that in reducing the scope and importance of our errors, we are properly humble; in truth, we are merely unwilling to bear the weight of our true responsibility.","Don\u2019t use language instrumentally","There\'s a class of things to be afraid of: it\'s \\"those things that you should be afraid of\\". Those are the things that go bump in the night, right? You\'re always exposed to them when you go to horror movies, especially if they\'re not the gore type of horror movie. They\'re always hinting at something that\'s going on outside of your perceptual sphere, and they frighten you because you don\'t know what\'s out there. For that the Blair Witch Project was a really good example, because nothing ever happens in that movie but it\'s frightenting and not gory. It plays on the fact tht you do have a category of Those Things Of Which You Should Be Afraid. So it\'s a category, frightening things. And only things capable of abstraction can come up with something like the caregory of frightenting things. And so Kali is like an embodied representation of the category of frightening things. And then you might ask yourself, well once you come up with the concept of the category of frightening things, maybe you can come up with the concept of what to do in the face of frightening things. Which is not the same as \\"what do you do when you encounter a lion\\", or \\"what do you do when you encounter someone angry\\". It\'s a meta question, right? But then you could say, at a philosophical level: \\"You will encounter elements of the category of all those things which can frighten and undermine you during your life. Is there something that you can do *as a category* that would help you deal with that.\\" And the answer is yeah, there is in fact. And that\'s what a lot of religious stories and symbolic stories are trying to propose to you, is the solution to that. One is, approach it voluntarily. Carefully, but voluntarily. Don\'t freeze and run away. Explore, instead. You expose yourself to risk but you gain knowledge. And you wouldn\'t have a cortex which, you know, is ridiculously disproportionate, if as a species we hadn\'t decided that exploration trumps escape or freezing. We explore. That can make you the master of a situation, so you can be the master of something like fire without being terrified of it.One of the things that the Hindus do in relationship to Kali, is offer sacrifices. So you can say, well why would you offer sacrifices to something you\'re afraid of. And it\'s because that is what you do, that\'s always what you do. You offer up sacrifices to the unknown in the hope that good things will happen to you.One example is that you\'re worried about your future. Maybe you\'re worried about your job, or who you\'re going to marry, or your family, there\'s a whole category of things to be worried about, so you\'re worried about your future. SO what\'re you doing in university? And the answer is you\'re sacrificing your free time in the present, to the cosmos so to speak, in the hope that if you offer up that sacrifice properly, the future will smile upon you. And that\'s one of the fundamental discoveries of the human race. And it\'s a big deal, that discovery: by changing what you cling to in the present, you can alter the future.","if you cannot understand why someone did something, look at the consequences\u2014and infer the motivation.","What you aim at determines what you see.","If you betray yourself, if you say untrue things, if you act out a lie, you weaken your character.","Worthlessness is the default condition.","Sometimes it seems the only people willing to give advice in a relativistic society are those with the least to offer.","We must each adopt as much responsibility as possible for individual life, society and the world. We must each tell the truth and repair what is in disrepair and break down and recreate what is old and outdated. It is in this manner that we can and must reduce the suffering that poisons the world. It\u2019s asking a lot. It\u2019s asking for everything.","You are by no means only what you already know. You are also all that which you could know, if you only would. Thus, you should never sacrifice what you could be for what you are. You should never give up the better that resides within for the security you already have\u2014and certainly not when you have already caught a glimpse, an undeniable glimpse, of something beyond.","If a child has not been taught to behave properly by the age of four, it will forever be difficult for him or her to make friends.","Human female choosiness is also why we are very different from the common ancestor we shared with our chimpanzee cousins, while the latter are very much the same. Women\u2019s proclivity to say no, more than any other force, has shaped our evolution into the creative, industrious, upright, large-brained (competitive, aggressive, domineering) creatures that we are.42 It is Nature as Woman who says, \u201cWell, bucko, you\u2019re good enough for a friend, but my experience of you so far has not indicated the suitability of your genetic material for continued propagation.","when once-na\xefve people recognize in themselves the seeds of evil and monstrosity, and see themselves as dangerous (at least potentially) their fear decreases. They develop more self-respect. Then, perhaps, they begin to resist oppression. They see that they have the ability to withstand, because they are terrible too. They see they can and must stand up, because they begin to understand how genuinely monstrous they will become, otherwise, feeding on their resentment, transforming it into the most destructive of wishes. To say it again: There is very little difference between the capacity for mayhem and destruction, integrated, and strength of character. This is one of the most difficult lessons of life.","Did what I want happen? No. Then my aim or my methods were wrong. I still have something to learn. That is the voice of authenticity. \u201cDid what I want happen? No. Then the world is unfair. People are jealous, and too stupid to understand. It is the fault of something or someone else.\u201d That is the voice of inauthenticity.\u201d","And you must be cautious, because making your life better means adopting a lot of responsibility, and that takes more effort and care than living stupidly in pain and remaining arrogant, deceitful and resentful.","You must determine where you are going, so that you can bargain for yourself, so that you don\u2019t end up resentful, vengeful and cruel. You have to articulate your own principles, so that you can defend yourself against others\u2019 taking inappropriate advantage of you, and so that you are secure and safe while you work and play. You must discipline yourself carefully. You must keep the promises you make to yourself, and reward yourself, so that you can trust and motivate yourself. You need to determine how to act toward yourself so that you are most likely to become and to stay a good person. It would be good to make the world a better place.","It\u2019s appropriate and praiseworthy to associate with people whose lives would be improved if they saw your life improve.","Mark Twain once said, \u201cIt\u2019s not what we don\u2019t know that gets us in trouble. It\u2019s what we know for sure that just ain\u2019t so.","If you remember that something bad happened, and you can figure out why, then you can try to avoid that bad thing happening again. That\u2019s the purpose of memory. It\u2019s not \u201cto remember the past. It\u2019s to stop the same damn thing from happening over and over.\u201d","It\'s a luxury to pursue what makes you happy; it\'s a moral obligation to pursue what you find meaningful.","Consult your resentment. It\u2019s a revelatory emotion, for all its pathology. It\u2019s part of an evil triad: arrogance, deceit, and resentment. Nothing causes more harm than this underworld Trinity. But resentment always means one of two things. Either the resentful person is immature, in which case he or she should shut up, quit whining, and get on with it, or there is tyranny afoot\u2014in which case the person subjugated has a moral obligation to speak up. Why? Because the consequence of remaining silent is worse. Of course, it\u2019s easier in the moment to stay silent and avoid conflict. But in the long term, that\u2019s deadly. When you have something to say, silence is a lie\u2014and tyranny feeds on lies. When should you push back against oppression, despite the danger? When you start nursing secret fantasies of revenge; when your life is being poisoned and your imagination fills with the wish to devour and destroy.","Question for parents: do you want to make your children safe, or strong?","Dreams shed light on the dim places where reason itself has yet to voyage.","Scccccratccch the most clever postmodern-relativist professor\u2019s Mercedes with a key, and you will see how fast the mask of relativism (with its pretense that there can be neither right nor wrong) and the cloak of radical tolerance come off.","It is far better to render Beings in your care competent than to protect them.","When my now-adult daughter was a child, another child once hit her on the head with a metal toy truck. I watched that same child, one year later, viciously push his younger sister backwards over a fragile glass-surfaced coffee table. His mother picked him up, immediately afterward (but not her frightened daughter), and told him in hushed tones not to do such things, while she patted him comfortingly in a manner clearly indicative of approval. She was out to produce a little God-Emperor of the Universe. That\u2019s the unstated goal of many a mother, including many who consider themselves advocates for full gender equality. Such women will object vociferously to any command uttered by an adult male, but will trot off in seconds to make their progeny a peanut-butter sandwich if he demands it while immersed self-importantly in a video game. The future mates of such boys have every reason to hate their mothers-in-law. Respect for women? That\u2019s for other boys, other men\u2014not for their dear sons.","It is necessary to be strong in the face of death, because death is intrinsic to life. It is for this reason that I tell my students: aim to be the person at your father\u2019s funeral that everyone, in their grief and misery, can rely on. There\u2019s a worthy and noble ambition: strength in the face of adversity.","you should not overlook the guidelines of your culture. Life is short, and you don\u2019t have time to figure everything out on your own. The wisdom of the past was hard-earned, and your dead ancestors may have something useful to tell you).","There are many systems of interaction between brain, body and social world that can get caught in positive feedback loops. Depressed people, for example, can start feeling useless and burdensome, as well as grief-stricken and pained. This makes them withdraw from contact with friends and family. Then the withdrawal makes them more lonesome and isolated, and more likely to feel useless and burdensome. Then they withdraw more. In this manner, depression spirals and amplifies","There\u2019s some real utility in gratitude. It\u2019s also good protection against the dangers of victimhood and resentment.","When you decide to learn about your faults, so that they can be rectified, you open a line of communication with the source of all revelatory thought. Maybe that\u2019s the same thing as consulting your conscience. Maybe that\u2019s the same thing, in some manner, as a discussion with God.","Our behavioral patterns are exceedingly complex, and psychology is a young science. The scope of our behavioral wisdom exceeds the breadth of our explicit interpretation. We act, even instruct, and yet do not understand. How can we do what we cannot explain?","To straddle that fundamental duality is to be balanced: to have one foot firmly planted in order and security, and the other in chaos, possibility, growth and adventure. When life suddenly reveals itself as intense, gripping and meaningful; when time passes and you\u2019re so engrossed in what you\u2019re doing you don\u2019t notice\u2014it is there and then that you are located precisely on the border between order and chaos.","Order is the Shire of Tolkien\u2019s hobbits: peaceful, productive and safely inhabitable, even by the naive. Chaos is the underground kingdom of the dwarves, usurped by Smaug, the treasure-hoarding serpent. Chaos is the deep ocean bottom to which Pinocchio voyaged to rescue his father from Monstro, whale and fire-breathing dragon. That journey into darkness and rescue is the most difficult thing a puppet must do, if he wants to be real; if he wants to extract himself from the temptations of deceit and acting and victimization and impulsive pleasure and totalitarian subjugation; if he wants to take his place as a genuine Being in the world.","When the aristocracy catches a cold, as it is said, the working class dies of pneumonia.","Say what you mean, so that you can find out what you mean. Act out what you say, so you can find out what happens. Then pay attention. Note your errors. Articulate them. Strive to correct them. That is how you discover the meaning of your life. That will protect you from the tragedy of your life. How could it be otherwise? Confront the chaos of Being. Take aim against a sea of troubles. Specify your destination, and chart your course. Admit to what you want. Tell those around you who you are. Narrow, and gaze attentively, and move forward, forthrightly. Be precise in your speech.","you should never sacrifice what you could be for what you are.","The Great Mother aborts children, and is the dead fetus; breeds pestilence, and is the plague; she makes of the skull something gruesomely compelling, and is all skulls herself. To unveil her is to risk madness, to gaze over the abyss, to lose the way, to remember the repressed trauma. She is the molestor of children, the golem, the bogey-man, the monster in the swamp, the rotting cadaverous zombie who threatens the living. She is progenitor of the devil, the \u201cstrange son of chaos. She is the serpent, and Eve, the temptress; she is the femme fatale, the insect in the ointment, the hidden cancer, the chronic sickness, the plague of locusts, the cause of drought, the poisoned water. She uses erotic pleasure as bait to keep the world alive and breeding; she is a gothic monster, who feeds on the blood of the living.\u201d","It is better, proverbially, to rule your own spirit than to rule a city.","we are increasingly falling prey to the desperation of meaninglessness,","One of the problems with being relatively wealthy if you are a parent is that you cannot provide your children with necessity.","loving your neighbour as yourself. The first lesson was that neither of these statements has anything to do with being nice. The second was that both are equations, rather than injunctions.

If I fail to do so, I will end up a slave, and the other person a tyrant. What good is that?\u201d","Here\u2019s a straightforward initial idea: rules should not be multiplied beyond necessity. Alternatively stated, bad laws drive out respect for good laws. This is the ethical\u2014even legal\u2014equivalent of Occam\u2019s razor, the scientist\u2019s conceptual guillotine, which states that the simplest possible hypothesis is preferable.","Ask yourself what you would require to be motivated to undertake the job, honestly, and listen to the answer. Don\u2019t tell yourself, \u201cI shouldn\u2019t need to do that to motivate myself. What do you know about yourself?

In real life, she had been a victim of Alzheimer\u2019s disease, and had regressed, before her death, to a semi-conscious state. In the dream, as well, she had lost her capacity for self-control. Her genital region was exposed, dimly; it had the appearance of a thick mat of hair. She was stroking herself, absent-mindedly. She walked over to me, with a handful of pubic hair, compacted into something resembling a large artist\u2019s paint-brush. She pushed this at my face. I raised my arm, several times, to deflect her hand; finally, unwilling to hurt her, or interfere with her any farther, I let her have her way. She stroked my face with the brush, gently, and said, like a child, \u201cisn\u2019t it soft? I looked at her ruined face and said, \u201cyes, Grandma, it\u2019s soft.\u201d","At the beginning of time, according to the great Western tradition, the Word of God transformed chaos into Being through the act of speech. It is axiomatic, within that tradition, that man and woman alike are made in the image of that God. We also transform chaos into Being, through speech. We transform the manifold possibilities of the future into the actualities of past and present.To tell the truth is to bring the most habitable reality into Being. Truth builds edifices that can stand a thousand years. Truth feeds and clothes the poor, and makes nations wealthy and safe. Truth reduces the terrible complexity of a man to the simplicity of his word, so that he can become a partner rather than an enemy. Truth makes the past truly past, and makes the best use of the future\'s possibilities. Truth is the ultimate, inexhaustible natural resource. It\'s the light in the darkness. See the truth. Tell the truth.","What you hear in the forest but cannot see might be a tiger. It might even be a conspiracy of tigers, each hungrier and more vicious than the other, led by a crocodile. But it might not be, too. If you turn and look, perhaps you\u2019ll see that it\u2019s just a squirrel. (I know someone who was actually chased by a squirrel.) Something is out there in the woods. You know that with certainty. But often it\u2019s only a squirrel. If you refuse to look, however, then it\u2019s a dragon, and you\u2019re no knight: you\u2019re a mouse confronting a lion; a rabbit, paralyzed by the gaze of a wolf. And I am not saying that it\u2019s always a squirrel. Often it\u2019s something truly terrible. But even what is terrible in actuality often pales in significance compared to what is terrible in imagination. And often what cannot be confronted because of its horror in imagination can in fact be confronted when reduced to its-still-admittedly-terrible actuality.","I came to understand, through the great George Orwell, that much of such thinking found its motivation in hatred of the rich and successful, instead of true regard for the poor. Besides, the socialists were more intrinsically capitalist than the capitalists. They believed just as strongly in money. They just thought that if different people had the money, the problems plaguing humanity would vanish.","Beauty shames the ugly. Strength shames the weak. Death shames the living - and the Ideal shames us all.","If you will not reveal yourself to others, you cannot reveal yourself to yourself.

They will instead encourage you when you do good for yourself and others and punish you carefully when you do not. This will help you bolster your resolve to do what you should do, in the most appropriate and careful manner. People who are not aiming up will do the opposite. They will become jealous when you succeed, or do something pristine. They will withdraw their presence or support, or actively punish you for it. They will override your accomplishment with a past action, real or imaginary, of their own. Maybe they are trying to test you, to see if your resolve is real, to see if you are genuine. But mostly they are dragging you down because your new improvements cast their faults in an even dimmer light.","The first: limit the rules. The second: Use the least force necessary to enforce those rules.","You might consider judging your success across all the games you play. Imagine that you are very good at some, middling at others, and terrible at the remainder. Perhaps that\u2019s how it should be. You might object: I should be winning at everything! But winning at everything might only mean that you\u2019re not doing anything new or difficult. You might be winning but you\u2019re not growing, and growing might be the most important form of winning. Should victory in the present always take precedence over trajectory across time?","When you dare aspire upward, you reveal the inadequacy of the present and the promise of the future. Then you disturb others, in the depths of their souls, where they understand that their cynicism and immobility are unjustifiable. You play Abel to their Cain.","A naively formulated goal transmutes, with time, into the sinister form of the life-lie. One forty-something client told me his vision, formulated by his younger self: \u201cI see myself retired, sitting on a tropical beach, drinking margaritas in the sunshine. That\u2019s not a plan. That\u2019s a travel poster. After eight margaritas, you\u2019re fit only to await the hangover. After three weeks of margarita-filled days, if you have any sense, you\u2019re bored stiff and self-disgusted. In a year, or less, you\u2019re pathetic. It\u2019s just not a sustainable approach to later life. This kind of oversimplification and falsification is particularly typical of ideologues. They adopt a single axiom: government is bad, immigration is bad, capitalism is bad, patriarchy is bad. Then they filter and screen their experiences and insist ever more narrowly that everything can be explained by that axiom. They believe, narcissistically, underneath all that bad theory, that the world could be put right, if only they held the controls.\u201d","In Paradise, everyone speaks the truth. That is what makes it Paradise. Tell the truth. Or, at least, don\u2019t lie.","There are so many ways that things can fall apart, or fail to work altogether, and it is always wounded people who are holding it together","alongside our wish to be free of rules, we all search for structure.","If someone is badly hurt at some point in life\u2014traumatized\u2014the dominance counter can transform in a manner that makes additional hurt more rather than less likely. This often happens in the case of people, now adults, who were viciously bullied during childhood or adolescence. They become anxious and easily upset. They shield themselves with a defensive crouch, and avoid the direct eye contact interpretable as a dominance challenge.This means that the damage caused by the bullying (the lowering of status and confidence) can continue, even after the bullying has ended.25 In the simplest of cases, the formerly lowly persons have matured and moved to new and more successful places in their lives. But they don\u2019t fully notice. Their now-counterproductive physiological adaptations to earlier reality remain, and they are more stressed and uncertain than is necessary. In more complex cases, a habitual assumption of subordination renders the person more stressed and uncertain than necessary, and their habitually submissive posturing continues to attract genuine negative attention from one or more of the fewer and generally less successful bullies still extant in the adult world. In such situations, the psychological consequence of the previous bullying increases the likelihood of continued bullying in the present (even though, strictly speaking, it wouldn\u2019t have to, because of maturation, or geographical relocation, or continued education, or improvement in objective status).","It isn\u2019t precisely that people will fight for what they believe. They will fight, instead, to maintain the match between what they believe, what they expect, and what they desire.","Life without law remains chaotic, effectively intolerable. Life that is pure law becomes sterile, equally unbearable. The domination of chaos or sterility equally breeds murderous resentment and hatred.","Perhaps, if we lived properly, we would be able to tolerate the weight of our own self-consciousness. Perhaps, if we lived properly, we could withstand the knowledge of our own fragility and mortality, without the sense of aggrieved victimhood that produces, first, resentment, then envy, and then the desire for vengeance and destruction. Perhaps, if we lived properly, we wouldn\'t have to turn to totalitarian certainty to shield ourselves from the knowledge of our own insufficiency and ignorance. Perhaps we could come to avoid those pathways to Hell\u2014and we have seen in the terrible twentieth century just how real Hell can be.","Perhaps happiness is always to be found in the journey uphill, and not in the fleeting sense of satisfaction awaiting at the next peak. Much of happiness is hope, no","that the soul of the individual eternally hungers for the heroism of genuine Being, and that the willingness to take on that responsibility is identical to the decision to live a meaningful life.","Kindness is the excuse that social justice warriors use when they want to exercise control over what other people think and say.","In my kingdom, as the Red Queen tells Alice in Wonderland, \u201cyou have to run as fast as you can just to stay in the same place.\u201d No one standing still can triumph, no matter how well constituted.\u201d","There\u2019s a worthy and noble ambition: strength in the face of adversity. That is very different from the wish for a life free of trouble.","There are no innocuous ideologies. They\'re forms of pathological over simplification and they\'re also clubs, I mean the kind of clubs that you hit people with as well as the kind that you belong to... the advantage (to me) of being an ideologue is that I can explain everything, I can feel morally superior, and I know who my enemies are...and you know what you\'re supposed to do with enemies? They\'re not your friends, you move against them.","If you pay attention, when you are seeking something, you will move towards your goal. More importantly, however, you will acquire the information that allows your goal itself to transform. A totalitarian never asks, \u201cWhat if my current ambition is in error? He treats it, instead, as the Absolute. It becomes his God, for all intents and purposes. It constitutes his highest value. It regulates his emotions and motivational states, and determines his thoughts. All people serve their ambition. In that matter, there are no atheists. There are only people who know, and don\u2019t know, what God they serve.\u201d","the fundamental moral question is not how to shelter children completely from misadventure and failure, so they never experience any fear or pain, but how to maximize their learning so that useful knowledge may be gained with minimal cost.","And even if it were possible to permanently banish everything threatening\u2014everything dangerous (and, therefore, everything challenging and interesting), that would mean only that another danger would emerge: that of permanent human infantilism and absolute uselessness. How could the nature of man ever reach its full potential without challenge and danger? How dull and contemptible would we become if there was no longer reason to pay attention? Maybe God thought His new creation would be able to handle the serpent, and considered its presence the lesser of two evils.","Much of happiness is hope, no matter how deep the underworld in which that hope was conceived.","There is very little difference between the capacity for mayhem and destruction, integrated, and strength of character. This is one of the most difficult lessons of life.","Cultivating judgment about the difference between virtue and vice is the beginning of wisdom, something that can never be out of date. By contrast, our modern relativism begins by asserting that making judgments about how to live is impossible, because there is no real good, and no true virtue (as these too are relative). Thus relativism\u2019s closest approximation to \u201cvirtue is \u201ctolerance.\u201d","Maybe your misery is the weapon you brandish in your hatred for those who rose upward while you waited and sank. Maybe your misery is your attempt to prove the world\'s injustice, instead of the evidence of your own sin, your missing of the mark, your conscious refusal to strive and live. Maybe your willingness to suffer in failure is inexhaustible, given what you use that suffering to prove. Maybe it\'s your revenge on Being. How exactly should I befriend you when you\'re in such a place? How could I?","what can be truly loved about a person is inseparable from their limitations.","The poor and stressed always die first, and in greater numbers. They are also much more susceptible to non- infectious diseases, such as cancer, diabetes and heart disease.","That\'s poetic in its malevolence","It\u2019s easier to put off until tomorrow what needs to be done today, and drown the upcoming months and years in today\u2019s cheap pleasures. As the infamous father of the Simpson clan puts it, immediately prior to downing a jar of mayonnaise and vodka, \u201cThat\u2019s a problem for Future Homer. Man, I don\u2019t envy that guy!66\u201d","People are better at filling and properly administering prescription medication to their pets than to themselves. That\u2019s not good. Even from your pet\u2019s perspective, it\u2019s not good. Your pet (probably) loves you, and would be happier if you took your medication.","To straddle that fundamental duality is to be balanced: to have one foot firmly planted in order and security, and the other in chaos, possibility, growth and adventure. When life suddenly reveals itself as intense, gripping and meaningful; when time passes and you\'re so engrossed in what you\'re doing you don\'t notice\u2013it is there and then that you are located precisely on the border between order and chaos.","It took me decades to understand what that means (to understand even part of what that means). It\u2019s this: once you become consciously aware that you, yourself, are vulnerable, you understand the nature of human vulnerability, in general. You understand what it\u2019s like to be fearful, and angry, and resentful, and bitter. You understand what pain means. And once you truly understand such feelings in yourself, and how they\u2019re produced, you understand how to produce them in others. It is in this manner that the self-conscious beings that we are become voluntarily and exquisitely capable of tormenting others (and ourselves, of course\u2014","Our society faces the increasing call to deconstruct its stabilizing traditions to include smaller and smaller numbers of people who do not or will not fit into the categories upon which even our perceptions are based. This is not a good thing. Each person\'s private trouble cannot be solved by a social revolution, because revolutions are destabilizing and dangerous.","Something we cannot see protects us from something we do not understand. The thing we cannot see is culture, in its intrapsychic or internal manifestation. The thing we do not understand is the chaos that gave rise to culture. If the structure of culture is disrupted, unwittingly, chaos returns. We will do anything \u2014 anything \u2014 to defend ourselves against that return.","Aleksandr Solzhenitsyn, the great documenter of the slave-labour-camp horrors of the latter, once wrote that the \u201cpitiful ideology holding that \u201chuman beings are created for happiness\u201d was an ideology \u201cdone in by the first blow of the work assigner\u2019s cudgel.\u201d","It is not virtuous to be victimized by a bully, even if that bully is oneself.","Life is indistinguishable from effortful maintenance","We outsource the problem of sanity.

It is, in short, all those things and situations we neither know nor understand.","people organize their brains with conversation.

It did not work for Tolstoy. It might not even have worked for Nietzsche, who arguably thought more clearly about such things than anyone in history. But if it is not thinking that can be relied upon in the direst of situations, what is left? Thought, after all, is the highest of human achievements, is it not?Perhaps not.Something supersedes thinking, despite its truly awesome power. When existence reveals itself as existentially intolerable, thinking collapses in on itself. In such situations\u2014in the depths\u2014it\u2019s noticing, not thinking, that does the trick.","We\u2019ll start our analysis with a truism, stark, self-evident and understated: Sometimes things do not go well. That seems to have much to do with the terrible nature of the world, with its plagues and famines and tyrannies and betrayals. But here\u2019s the rub: sometimes, when things are not going well, it\u2019s not the world that\u2019s the cause. The cause is instead that which is currently most valued, subjectively and personally. Why? Because the world is revealed, to an indeterminate degree, through the template of your values\u2026If the world you are seeing is not the world you want, therefore, it\u2019s time to examine your values. It\u2019s time to rid yourself of your current presuppositions. It\u2019s time to let go. It might even be time to sacrifice what you love best, so that you can become who you might become, instead of staying who you are.","Anomalies manifest themselves on the border between chaos and order, so to speak, and have a threatening and promising aspect. The promising aspect dominates, when the contact is voluntary, when the exploring agent is up-to-date \u2013 when the individual has explored all previous anomalies, released the \u201cinformation they contained, and built a strong personality and steady \u201cworld\u201d from that information.The threatening aspect dominates, when the contact is involuntary, when the exploring agent is not up-to-date \u2013 when the individual has run away from evidence of his previous errors, failed to extract the information \u201clurking behind\u201d his mistakes, weakened his personality, and destabilised his \u201cworld.\u201dThe phenomenon of interest \u2013 that precursor to exploratory behaviour \u2013 signals the presence of a potentially \u201cbeneficial\u201d anomaly. Interest manifests itself where an assimilable but novel phenomenon exists: where something new \u201chides,\u201d in a partially comprehensible form. Devout adherence to the dictates of interest \u2013 assuming a suitably disciplined character \u2013 therefore insures stabilisation and renewal of personality and world.Interest is a spirit beckoning from the unknown \u2013 a spirit calling from outside the \u201cwalls\u201d of society. Pursuit of individual interest means hearkening to this spirit\u2019s call \u2013 means journeying outside the protective walls of childhood dependence and adolescent group identification; means also return to and rejuvenation of society.This means that pursuit of individual interest \u2013 development of true individuality \u2013 is equivalent to identification with the hero. Such identification renders the world bearable, despite its tragedies \u2013 and reduces unnecessary suffering, which most effectively destroys, to an absolute minimum.This is the message that everyone wants to hear. Risk your security. Face the unknown. Quit lying to yourself, and do what your heart truly tells you to do. You will be better for it, and so will the world.\u201d","I learned two very important lessons from Carl Jung, the famous Swiss depth psychologist, about \u201cdoing unto others as you would have them do unto you or \u201cloving your neighbour as yourself.\u201d The first lesson was that neither of these statements has anything to do with being nice. The second was that both are equations, rather than injunctions. If I am someone\u2019s friend, family member, or lover, then I am morally obliged to bargain as hard on my own behalf as they are on theirs. If I fail to do so, I will end up a slave, and the other person a tyrant. What good is that? It is much better for any relationship when both partners are strong. Furthermore, there is little difference between standing up and speaking for yourself, when you are being bullied or otherwise tormented and enslaved, and standing up and speaking for someone else. As Jung points out, this means embracing and loving the sinner who is yourself, as much as forgiving and aiding someone else who is stumbling and imperfect.\u201d","That which you most need to find will be found where you least wish to look.","Lobsters have more in common with you than you might think (particularly when you are feeling crabby\u2014ha ha).","Territory matters, and there is little difference between territorial rights and social status. It is often a matter of life and death.","we may not exactly be God, but we\u2019re not exactly nothing, either.","The only time no ever means no in the absence of violence is when it is uttered by one civilized person to another.","Here\u2019s something to consider: If you have a friend whose friendship you wouldn\u2019t recommend to your sister, or your father, or your son, why would you have such a friend for yourself? You might say: out of loyalty. Well, loyalty is not identical to stupidity. Loyalty must be negotiated, fairly and honestly. Friendship is a reciprocal arrangement. You are not morally obliged to support someone who is making the world a worse place. Quite the opposite. You should choose people who want things to be better, not worse. It\u2019s a good thing, not a selfish thing, to choose people who are good for you. It\u2019s appropriate and praiseworthy to associate with people whose lives would be improved if they saw your life improve. If you surround yourself with people who support your upward aim, they will not tolerate your cynicism and destructiveness. They will instead encourage you when you do good for yourself and others and punish you carefully when you do not. This will help bolster your resolve to do what you should do, in the most appropriate and careful manner. People who are not aiming up will do the opposite. They will offer a former smoker a cigarette and a former alcoholic a beer. They will become jealous when you succeed, or do something pristine. They will withdraw their presence or support, or actively punish you for it. They will over-ride your accomplishment with a past action, real or imaginary, of their own. Maybe they are trying to test you, to see if your resolve is real, to see if you are genuine. But mostly they are dragging you down because your new improvements cast their faults in an even dimmer light.","Each person\u2019s private trouble cannot be solved by a social revolution, because revolutions are destabilizing and dangerous. We have learned to live together and organize our complex societies slowly and incrementally, over vast stretches of time, and we do not understand with sufficient exactitude why what we are doing works. Thus, altering our ways of social being carelessly in the name of some ideological shibboleth (diversity springs to mind) is likely to produce far more trouble than good, given the suffering that even small revolutions generally produce.","I\u2019m not hurt. I\u2019m appalled.","Here are some suggestions. Do not bite, kick or hit, except in self-defence. Do not torture and bully other children, so you don\u2019t end up in jail. Eat in a civilized and thankful manner, so that people are happy to have you at their house, and pleased to feed you. Learn to share, so other kids will play with you. Pay attention when spoken to by adults, so they don\u2019t hate you and might therefore deign to teach you something. Go to sleep properly, and peaceably, so that your parents can have a private life and not resent your existence. Take care of your belongings, because you need to learn how and because you\u2019re lucky to have them. Be good company when something fun is happening, so that you\u2019re invited for the fun. Act so that other people are happy you\u2019re around, so that people will want you around. A child who knows these rules will be welcome everywhere.","Imagine the case of someone supervising an exceptional team of workers, all of them striving towards a collectively held goal; imagine them hardworking, brilliant, creative and unified. But the person supervising is also responsible for someone troubled, who is performing poorly, elsewhere. In a fit of inspiration, the well-meaning manager moves that problematic person into the midst of his stellar team, hoping to improve him by example. What happens?\u2014and the psychological literature is clear on this point.64 Does the errant interloper immediately straighten up and fly right? No. Instead, the entire team degenerates. The newcomer remains cynical, arrogant and neurotic. He complains. He shirks. He misses important meetings. His low-quality work causes delays, and must be redone by others. He still gets paid, however, just like his teammates. The hard workers who surround him start to feel betrayed. \u201cWhy am I breaking myself into pieces striving to finish this project, each thinks, \u201cwhen my new team member never breaks a sweat?\u201d The same thing happens when well-meaning counsellors place a delinquent teen among comparatively civilized peers. The delinquency spreads, not the stability.65 Down is a lot easier than up.\u201d","Chaos, the eternal feminine, is also the crushing force of sexual selection. Women are choosy maters (unlike female chimps, their closest animal counterparts). Most men do not meet female human standards. It is for this reason that women on dating sites rate 85 percent of men as below average in attractiveness. It is for this reason that we all have twice as many female ancestors as male (imagine that all the women who have ever lived have averaged one child. Now imagine that half the men who have ever lived have fathered two children, if they had any, while the other half fathered none).41 It is Woman as Nature who looks at half of all men and says, \u201cNo! For the men, that\u2019s a direct encounter with chaos, and it occurs with devastating force every time they are turned down for a date. Human female choosiness is also why we are very different from the common ancestor we shared with our chimpanzee cousins, while the latter are very much the same. Women\u2019s proclivity to say no, more than any other force, has shaped our evolution into the creative, industrious, upright, large-brained (competitive, aggressive, domineering) creatures that we are.42 It is Nature as Woman who says, \u201cWell, bucko, you\u2019re good enough for a friend, but my experience of you so far has not indicated the suitability of your genetic material for continued propagation.\u201d","Consider the person who insists that everything is right in her life. She avoids conflict, and smiles, and does what she is asked to do. She finds a niche and hides in it. She does not question authority or put her own ideas forward, and does not complain when mistreated. She strives for invisibility, like a fish in the centre of a swarming school. But a secret unrest gnaws at her heart. She is still suffering, because life is suffering. She is lonesome and isolated and unfulfilled. But her obedience and self-obliteration eliminate all the meaning from her life. She has become nothing but a slave, a tool for others to exploit. She does not get what she wants, or needs, because doing so would mean speaking her mind. So, there is nothing of value in her existence to counter-balance life\u2019s troubles. And that makes her sick.","If you will not reveal yourself to others, you cannot reveal yourself to yourself. That does not only mean that you suppress who you are, although it also means that. It means that so much of what you could be will never be forced by necessity to come forward. This is a biological truth, as well as a conceptual truth. When you explore boldly, when you voluntarily confront the unknown, you gather information and build your renewed self out of that information. That is the conceptual element. However, researchers have recently discovered that new genes in the central nervous system turn themselves on when an organism is placed (or places itself) in a new situation. These genes code for new proteins. These proteins are the building blocks for new structures in the brain. This means that a lot of you is still nascent, in the most physical of senses, and will not be called forth by stasis. You have to say something, go somewhere and do things to get turned on.","Standards of better or worse are not illusory or unnecessary. If you hadn\'t decided that what you are doing right now was better than the alternatives, you wouldn\'t be doing it. The idea of a value-free choice is a contradiction in terms. Value judgements are a precondition for action. Furthermore, every activity, once chosen, comes with its own internal standards of accomplishment. If something can be done at all, it can be done better or worse. To do anything at all is therefore to play a game with a defined and valued end, which can always be reached more or less efficiently and elegantly. Ever game comes with its chance of success or failure. Differentials in quality are omnipresent, Furthermore, if there was no better or worse, nothing would be worth doing. There would be no value and, therefore, no meaning.","Behavior is imitated, then abstracted into play, formalized into drama and story, crystallized into myth and codified into religion\u2014and only then criticized in philosophy, and provided, post-hoc, with rational underpinnings","You already know what you know, after all\u2014and, unless your life is perfect, what you know is not enough. You remain threatened by disease, and self-deception, and unhappiness, and malevolence, and betrayal, and corruption, and pain, and limitation. You are subject to all these things, in the final analysis, because you are just too ignorant to protect yourself. If you just knew enough, you could be healthier and more honest. You would suffer less. You could recognize, resist and even triumph over malevolence and evil. You would neither betray a friend, nor deal falsely and deceitfully in business, politics or love. However, your current knowledge has neither made you perfect nor kept you safe. So, it is insufficient, by definition\u2014radically, fatally insufficient.","Aristotle defined the virtues simply as the ways of behaving that are most conducive to happiness in life.","People think they think, but it\u2019s not true. It\u2019s mostly self-criticism that passes for thinking. True thinking is rare\u2014just like true listening. Thinking is listening to yourself. It\u2019s difficult. To think, you have to be at least two people at the same time. Then you have to let those people disagree. Thinking is an internal dialogue between two or more different views of the world.","Satan says, offering the next temptation. \u201cIf God exists, He will surely save you. If you are in fact his Son, God will surely save you. Why would God not make Himself manifest, to rescue His only begotten Child from hunger and isolation and the presence of great evil? But that establishes no pattern for life. It doesn\u2019t even work as literature. The deus ex machina\u2014the emergence of a divine force that magically rescues the hero from his predicament\u2014is the cheapest trick in the hack writer\u2019s playbook. It makes a mockery of independence, and courage, and destiny, and free will, and responsibility. Furthermore, God is in no wise a safety net for the blind. He\u2019s not someone to be commanded to perform magic tricks, or forced into Self-revelation\u2014not even by His own Son.\u201d","Michelangelo\u2019s great perfect marble David cries out to its observer: \u201cYou could be more than you are.","We experience much of our positive emotion in relation to goals. We are not happy, technically speaking, unless we see ourselves progressing\u2014and the very idea of progression implies value. Worse yet is the fact that the meaning of life without positive value is not simply neutral. Because we are vulnerable and mortal, pain and anxiety are an integral part of human existence. We must have something to set against the suffering that is intrinsic to Being. We must have the meaning inherent in a profound system of value or the horror of existence rapidly becomes paramount. Then, nihilism beckons, with its hopelessness and despair.","The people who wrote and edited the Bible, for example, weren\u2019t scientists. They couldn\u2019t have been scientists, even if they had wanted to be. The viewpoints, methods and practices of science hadn\u2019t been formulated when the Bible was written. Religion is instead about proper behaviour. It\u2019s about what Plato called \u201cthe Good. A genuine religious acolyte isn\u2019t trying to formulate accurate ideas about the objective nature of the world (although he may be trying to do that too). He\u2019s striving, instead, to be a \u201cgood person.\u201d It may be the case that to him \u201cgood\u201d means nothing but \u201cobedient\u201d\u2014even blindly obedient. Hence the classic liberal Western enlightenment objection to religious belief: obedience is not enough.

Instead of playing the tyrant, therefore, you are paying attention. You are telling the truth, instead of manipulating the world. You are negotiating, instead of playing the martyr or the tyrant. You no longer have to be envious, because you no longer know that someone else truly has it better. You no longer have to be frustrated, because you have learned to aim low, and to be patient. You are discovering who you are, and what you want, and what you are willing to do. You are finding that the solutions to your particular problems have to be tailored to you, personally and precisely. You are less concerned with the actions of other people, because you have plenty to do yourself. Attend to the day, but aim at the highest good.","What shall I do with a torn nation? Stitch it back together with careful words of truth. The importance of this injunction has, if anything, become clearer over the past few years: we are dividing, and polarizing, and drifting toward chaos. It is necessary, under such conditions, if we are to avoid catastrophe, for each of us to bring forward the truth, as we see it: not the arguments that justify our ideologies, not the machinations that further our ambitions, but the stark pure facts of our existence, revealed for others to see and contemplate, so that we can find common ground and proceed together.","But we can aim too high. Or too low. Or too chaotically. So we fail and live in disappointment, even when we appear to others to be living well.","Why, for example, is it still acceptable to profess the philosophy of a Communist or, if not that, to at least admire the work of Marx? Why is it still acceptable to regard the Marxist doctrine as essentially accurate in its diagnosis of the hypothetical evils of the free-market, democratic West; to still consider that doctrine \u201cprogressive, and fit for the compassionate and proper thinking person? Twenty-five million dead through internal repression in the Soviet Union. Sixty million dead in Mao\u2019s China. The horrors of Cambodia\u2019s Killing Fields, with their two million corpses. The barely animate body politic of Cuba, where people struggle even now to feed themselves. Venezuela, where it has now been made illegal to attribute a child\u2019s death in hospital to starvation. No political experiment has ever been tried so widely, with so many disparate people, in so many different countries and failed so absolutely and so catastrophically. Is it mere ignorance that allows today\u2019s Marxists to flaunt their continued allegiance \u2013 to present it as compassion and care? Or is it instead, envy of the successful, in near-infinite proportions? Or something akin to hatred for mankind itself? How much proof do we need?\u201d","When things break down, what has been ignored rushes in. When things are no longer specified, with precision, the walls crumble, and chaos makes its presence known. When we\'ve been careless, and let things slide, what we have refused to attend to gathers itself up, adopts a serpentine form, and strikes--often at the worst possible moment. It is then that we see what focused intent, precision of aim and careful attention protects us from.","It is instead the realization that the tragic irrationalities of life must be counterbalanced by an equally irrational commitment to the essential goodness of Being.","It is Nature as Woman who says, \u201cWell, bucko, you\u2019re good enough for a friend, but my experience of you so far has not indicated the suitability of your genetic material for continued propagation.","Boys are suffering, in the modern world. They are more disobedient\u2014negatively\u2014or more independent\u2014positively\u2014than girls, and they suffer for this, throughout their pre-university educational career. They are less agreeable (agreeableness being a personality trait associated with compassion, empathy and avoidance of conflict) and less susceptible to anxiety and depression,172 at least after both sexes hit puberty.173 Boys\u2019 interests tilt towards things; girls\u2019 interests tilt towards people.174 Strikingly, these differences, strongly influenced by biological factors, are most pronounced in the Scandinavian societies where gender-equality has been pushed hardest: this is the opposite of what would be expected by those who insist, ever more loudly, that gender is a social construct. It isn\u2019t. This isn\u2019t a debate. The data are in.","(90 percent of communication occurs using just 500 words), among many other things.

Some people degenerate into the hell of resentment and the hatred of Being, but most refuse to do so, despite their suffering and disappointments and losses and inadequacies and ugliness, and again that is a miracle for those with the eyes to see it.","A certain amount of creativity and rebellion must be tolerated - or welcomed, depending on your point of view - to maintain the process of regeneration. Every rule was once a creative act, breaking other rules.","True thinking is rare\u2014just like true listening.","Your wisdom then consists not of the knowledge you already have, but the continual search for knowledge, which is the highest form of wisdom.","Men enforce a code of behaviour on each other, when working together.

Don\u2019t be a slave to stupid rules. Don\u2019t, in the immortal words of Arnold Schwarzenegger, be a girlie man. Don\u2019t be dependent. At all. Ever. Period.

Then we might treat ourselves like people we cared for. We might strive to set the world straight. We might orient it toward Heaven, where we would want people we cared for to dwell, instead of Hell, where our resentment and hatred would eternally sentence everyone.","Set your ambitions, even if you are uncertain about what they should be. The better ambitions have to do with the development of character and ability, rather than status and power.","Every explorer is therefore, by necessity, a revolutionary, and every successful revolutionary is a peacemaker.","Many bureaucracies have petty authoritarians within them, generating unnecessary rules and procedures simply to express and cement power. Such people produce powerful undercurrents of resentment around them which, if expressed, would limit their expression of pathological power. It is in this manner that the willingness of the individual to stand up for him or herself protects everyone from the corruption of society.","The light that you discover in your life is proportionate to the amount of the darkness you are willing to forthrightly confront (from the debate between Jordan Peterson and Slavoj Zizek)","Imagine a person who enjoys alcohol, perhaps a bit too much. He has a quick three or four drinks. His blood alcohol level spikes sharply. This can be extremely exhilarating, particularly for someone who has a genetic predisposition to alcoholism.23 But it only occurs while blood alcohol levels are actively rising, and that only continues if the drinker keeps drinking. When he stops, not only does his blood alcohol level plateau and then start to sink, but his body begins to produce a variety of toxins, as it metabolizes the ethanol already consumed. He also starts to experience alcohol withdrawal, as the anxiety systems that were suppressed during intoxication start to hyper-respond. A hangover is alcohol withdrawal (which quite frequently kills withdrawing alcoholics), and it starts all too soon after drinking ceases. To continue the warm glow, and stave off the unpleasant aftermath, the drinker may just continue to drink, until all the liquor in his house is consumed, the bars are closed and his money is spent. The next day, the drinker wakes up, badly hungover. So far, this is just unfortunate. The real trouble starts when he discovers that his hangover can be \u201ccured with a few more drinks the morning after. Such a cure is, of course, temporary. It merely pushes the withdrawal symptoms a bit further into the future. But that might be what is required, in the short term, if the misery is sufficiently acute. So now he has learned to drink to cure his hangover. When the medication causes the disease, a positive feedback loop has been established.\u201d","What shall I do when my enemy succeeds?

A well-practised and competent public speaker addresses a single, identifiable person, watches that individual nod, shake his head, frown, or look confused, and responds appropriately and directly to those gestures and expressions. Then, after a few phrases, rounding out some idea, he switches to another audience member, and does the same thing.\u201d","Inequality is the deepest of problems, built into the structure of reality itself, and will not be solved by the presumptuous, ideology-inspiring retooling of the rare free, stable and productive democracies of the world.","When you move, everything is up in the air, at least for a while.

If you don\u2019t know where you are, precisely, then you could be anywhere. Anywhere is too many places to be, and some of those places are very bad. You must determine where you have been in your life, because otherwise you can\u2019t get to where you\u2019re going. You can\u2019t get from point A to point B unless you are already at point A, and if you\u2019re just \u201canywhere the chances you are at point A are very small indeed. You must determine where you are going in your life, because you cannot get there unless you move in that direction. Random wandering will not move you forward. It will instead disappoint and frustrate you and make you anxious and unhappy and hard to get along with (and then resentful, and then vengeful, and then worse). Say what you mean, so that you can find out what you mean. Act out what you say, so you can find out what happens. Then pay attention. Note your errors. Articulate them. Strive to correct them. That is how you discover the meaning of your life. That will protect you from the tragedy of your life. How could it be otherwise? Confront the chaos of Being. Take aim against a sea of troubles.

He never leaves, and she is never lonely. It\u2019s an evil conspiracy, forged slowly, as the pathology unfolds, by thousands of knowing winks and nods. She plays the martyr, doomed to support her son, and garners nourishing sympathy, like a vampire, from supporting friends. He broods in his basement, imagining himself oppressed. He fantasizes with delight about the havoc he might wreak on the world that rejected him for his cowardice, awkwardness and inability. And sometimes he wreaks precisely that havoc.

To gather is to specify and to grasp. We fling stones, and spears, and boomerangs. We toss balls through hoops, and hit pucks into nets, and curl carved granite rocks down the ice onto horizontal bull\u2019s-eyes. We launch projectiles at targets with bows, guns, rifles and rockets. We hurl insults, launch plans, and pitch ideas. We succeed when we score a goal or hit a target.

Literary, existential philosophers, beginning with S\xf8ren Kierkegaard, conceived of this mode of Being as \u201cinauthentic. An inauthentic person continues to perceive and act in ways his own experience has demonstrated false. He does not speak with his own voice.\u201d","What shall I do with my parents? Act such that your actions justify the suffering they endured. To act to justify the suffering of your parents is to remember all the sacrifices that all the others who lived before you (not least your parents) have made for you in all the course of the terrible past, to be grateful for all the progress that has been thereby made, and then to act in accordance with that remembrance & gratitude. People sacrificed immensely to bring about what we have now. In many cases, they literally died for it - & we should act with some respect for that fact.","Thus, you need to place one foot in what you have mastered and understood and the other in what you are currently exploring and mastering. Then you have positioned yourself where the terror of existence is under control and you are secure, but where you are also alert and engaged.

If you truly wanted, perhaps you would receive, if you asked. If you truly sought, perhaps you would find what you seek. If you knocked, truly wanting to enter, perhaps the door would open. But there will be times in your life when it will take everything you have to face what is in front of you, instead of hiding away from a truth so terrible that the only thing worse is the falsehood you long to replace it with. Do not hide unwanted things in the fog.","Depressed people, for example, can start feeling useless and burdensome, as well as grief-stricken and pained. This makes them withdraw from contact with friends and family. Then the withdrawal makes them more lonesome and isolated, and more likely to feel useless and burdensome. Then they withdraw more. In this manner, depression spirals and amplifies.","Assume ignorance before malevolence. No one has a direct pipeline to your wants and needs\u2014not even you.","When someone claims to be acting from the highest principles, for the good of others, there is no reason to assume that the person\u2019s motives are genuine.

If\u2014in the best of cases\u2014it is society\'s fault, then society can be made to pay. This sleight-of-hand maneuver transforms the undisciplined into the admirable rebel, at least in his own eyes, and allows him to seek unjustified revenge in the disguise of the revolutionary hero. A more absurd parody of heroic behavior can hardly be imagined.","My position was terrible. I knew that I could find nothing in the way of rational knowledge except a denial of life; and in faith I could find nothing except a denial of reason, and this was even more impossible than a denial of life. According to rational knowledge, it followed that life is evil, and people know it. They do not have to live, yet they have lived and they do live, just as I myself had lived, even though I had known for a long time that life is meaningless and evil. Try as he might, Tolstoy could identify only four means of escaping from such thoughts. One was retreating into childlike ignorance of the problem. Another was pursuing mindless pleasure. The third was \u201ccontinuing to drag out a life that is evil and meaningless, knowing beforehand that nothing can come of it. He identified that particular form of escape with weakness: \u201cThe people in this category know that death is better than life, but they do not have the strength to act rationally and quickly put an end to the delusion by killing themselves\u2026.\u201d Only the fourth and final mode of escape involved \u201cstrength and energy. It consists of destroying life, once one has realized that life is evil and meaningless.\u201d Tolstoy relentlessly followed his thoughts: Only unusually strong and logically consistent people act in this manner. Having realized all the stupidity of the joke that is being played on us and seeing that the blessings of the dead are greater than those of the living and that it is better not to exist, they act and put an end to this stupid joke; and they use any means of doing it: a rope around the neck, water, a knife in the heart, a train.\u201d","We are always and simultaneously at point \u201ca (which is less desirable than it could be), moving towards point \u201cb\u201d (which we deem better, in accordance with our explicit and implicit values). We always encounter the world in a state of insufficiency and seek its correction. We can imagine new ways that things could be set right, and improved, even if we have everything we thought we needed. Even when satisfied, temporarily, we remain curious. We live within a framework that defines the present as eternally lacking and the future as eternally better. If we did not see things this way, we would not act at all. We wouldn\u2019t even be able to see, because to see we must focus, and to focus we must pick one thing above all else on which to focus. But we can see. We can even see things that aren\u2019t there. We can envision new ways that things could be better. We can construct new, hypothetical worlds, where problems we weren\u2019t even aware of can now show themselves and be addressed. The advantages of this are obvious: we can change the world so that the intolerable state of the present can be rectified in the future. The disadvantage to all this foresight and creativity is chronic unease and discomfort. Because we always contrast what is with what could be, we have to aim at what could be. But we can aim too high. Or too low. Or too chaotically. So we fail and live in disappointment, even when we appear to others to be living well.\u201d","Rules are there for a reason.

Competition is for personal growth and status.","But you will learn something from that, and use what you learn in the future\u2014and the alternative to that single sharp pain is the dull ache of continued hopelessness and vague failure and the sense that time, precious time, is slipping by.","Experience is the best teacher, and the worst experiences teach the best lessons.","How could the world be freed from the terrible dilemma of conflict, on the one hand, and psychological and social dissolution, on the other? The answer was this: through the elevation and development of the individual, and through the willingness of everyone to shoulder the burden of Being and to take the heroic path.","We must each adopt as much responsibility as possible for individual life, society and the world. We must each tell the truth and repair what is in disrepair and break down and recreate what is old and outdated. It is in this manner that we can and must reduce the suffering that poisons the world. It\u2019s asking a lot.","To act is literally to manifest preference about one set of possibilities, contrasted with an infinite set of alternatives. If we wish to live, we must act. Acting, we value.","That same brutal principle of unequal distribution applies outside the financial domain\u2014 indeed, anywhere that creative production is required. The majority of scientific papers are published by a very small group of scientists. A tiny proportion of musicians produces almost all the recorded commercial music. Just a handful of authors sell all the books. A million and a half separately titled books (!) sell each year in the US. However, only five hundred of these sell more than a hundred thousand copies. 12 Similarly, just four classical composers (Bach, Beethoven, Mozart, and Tchaikovsky) wrote almost all the music played by modern orchestras. Bach, for his part, composed so prolifically that it would take decades of work merely to hand- copy his scores, yet only a small fraction of this prodigious output is commonly performed.","Here\u2019s the fundamental problem: group identity can be fractionated right down to the level of the individual. That sentence should be written in capital letters. Every person is unique\u2014and not just in a trivial manner: importantly, significantly, meaningfully unique. Group membership cannot capture that variability. Period.","The fact that power plays a role in human motivation does not mean that it plays the only role, or even the primary role ...

Someone could be homecoming queen. Someone else could be spelling-bee champ, math whiz or basketball star. There were only one or two mechanics and a couple of teachers.

It may be for that reason that people who were born in small towns are statistically overrepresented among the eminent.68 If","When a lobster that has just lost a battle is exposed to serotonin, it will stretch itself out, advance even on former victors, and fight longer and harder.9 The drugs prescribed to depressed human beings, which are selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors, have much the same chemical and behavioural effect.

You could be better!","There is no faith and no courage and no sacrifice in doing what is expedient. There is no careful observation that actions and presuppositions matter, or that the world is made of what matters. To have meaning in your life is better than to have what you want, because you may neither know what you want, nor what you truly need. Meaning is something that comes upon you, of its own accord. You can set up the preconditions, you can follow meaning, when it manifests itself, but you cannot simply produce it, as an act of will. Meaning signifies that you are in the right place, at the right time, properly balanced between order and chaos, where everything lines up as best it can at that moment.","It\'s the chattering buzz of ideologically possessed demons.","Alcohol temporarily lifts the terrible burden of self-consciousness from people.

This is not because of rationality itself, as a process. That process can produce clarity and progress. It is because rationality is subject to the single worst temptation\u2014to raise what it knows now to the status of an absolute.","To say it again: it is the greatest temptation of the rational faculty to glorify its own capacity and its own productions and to claim that in the face of its theories nothing transcendent or outside its domain need exist.

This also meant that it had become acceptable to overlook and shirk responsibility for the suffering that existed in the here-and-now; Second, passive acceptance of the status quo, because salvation could not be earned in any case through effort in this life (a consequence that Marx also derided, with his proposition that religion was the opiate of the masses); and, finally, third, the right of the believer to reject any real moral burden (outside of the stated belief in salvation through Christ), because the Son of God had already done all the important work. It was for such reasons that Dostoevsky, who was a great influence on Nietzsche, also criticized institutional Christianity (although he arguably managed it in a more ambiguous but also more sophisticated manner).","And this brings us to a third erroneous concept: that nature is sometimes strickly segregated from the cultral constructs that have emerged within it.

Then it contrasts you unfavorably with someone truly stellar, within that domain.It can take that final step even further, using the unbridgeable gap between you and its target of comparison as evidence for the fundamental injustice of life. That way your motivation to do anything at all can be most effectively undermined.","Have they been educated to the level of their intellectual ability or ambition? Is their use of free time engaging, meaningful, and productive? Have they formulated solid and well-articulated plans for the future?

Close and functional familial relationships? A career\u2014or, at least, a job\u2014that is financially sufficient, stable and, if possible, a source of satisfaction and opportunity?

In such situations\u2014in the depths\u2014it\'s noticing, not thinking, that does the trick.","There is a story for children, There\u2019s No Such Thing as a Dragon, by Jack Kent, that I really like. It\u2019s a very simple tale, at least on the surface. I once read its few pages to a group of retired University of Toronto alumni, and explained its symbolic meaning.*2 It\u2019s about a small boy, Billy Bixbee, who spies a dragon sitting on his bed one morning. It\u2019s about the size of a house cat, and friendly. He tells his mother about it, but she tells him that there\u2019s no such thing as a dragon. So, it starts to grow. It eats all of Billy\u2019s pancakes. Soon it fills the whole house. Mom tries to vacuum, but she has to go in and out of the house through the windows because of the dragon everywhere. It takes her forever. Then, the dragon runs off with the house. Billy\u2019s dad comes home\u2014and there\u2019s just an empty space, where he used to live. The mailman tells him where the house went. He chases after it, climbs up the dragon\u2019s head and neck (now sprawling out into the street) and rejoins his wife and son. Mom still insists that the dragon does not exist, but Billy, who\u2019s pretty much had it by now, insists, \u201cThere is a dragon, Mom. Instantly, it starts to shrink. Soon, it\u2019s cat-sized again. Everyone agrees that dragons of that size (1) exist and (2) are much preferable to their gigantic counterparts. Mom, eyes reluctantly opened by this point, asks somewhat plaintively why it had to get so big. Billy quietly suggests: \u201cmaybe it wanted to be noticed.\u201d","The healthy, dynamic, and above all else truthful personality will admit to error. It will voluntarily shed\u2014let die\u2014outdated perceptions, thoughts, and habits, as impediments to its further success and growth. This is the soul that will let its old beliefs burn away, often painfully, so that it can live again, and move forward, renewed. This is also the soul that will transmit what it has learned during that process of death and rebirth, so that others can be reborn along with it. Aim at something. Pick the best target you can currently conceptualize. Stumble toward it. Notice your errors and misconceptions along the way, face them, and correct them. Get your story straight. Past, present, future\u2014they all matter. You need to map your path. You need to know where you were, so that you do not repeat the mistakes of the past. You need to know where you are, or you will not be able to draw a line from your starting point to your destination. You need to know where you are going, or you will drown in uncertainty, unpredictability, and chaos, and starve for hope and inspiration. For better or worse, you are on a journey. You are having an adventure\u2014and your map better be accurate. Voluntarily confront what stands in your way. The way\u2014that is the path of life, the meaningful path of life, the straight and narrow path that constitutes the very border between order and chaos, and the traversing of which brings them into balance.

That does not stop the deadwood from accumulating. Sooner or later, a fire will start. When it does, it will burn so hot that everything will be destroyed\u2014even the soil in which the forest grows.","If society is corrupt, but not the individuals within it, then where did the corruption originate? How is it propagated? It\u2019s a one-sided, deeply ideological theory.","The Sumerians considered themselves destined to \u201cclothe and feed such gods, because they viewed themselves as the servants, in a sense, of what we would call instinctive forces, \u201celicited\u201d by the \u201cenvironment.\u201d Such forces can be reasonably regarded as the Sumerians regarded them\u2014as deities inhabiting a \u201csupracelestial place,\u201d extant prior to the dawn of humanity. Erotic attraction, for example\u2014a powerful god\u2014has a developmental history that predates the emergence of humanity, is associated with relatively \u201cinnate\u201d releasing \u201cstimuli\u201d (those that characterize erotic beauty), is of terrible power, and has an existence \u201ctranscending\u201d that of any individual who is currently \u201cpossessed.\u201d Pan, the Greek god of nature, produced/represented fear (produced \u201cpanic\u201d); Ares or the Roman Mars, warlike fury and aggression. We no longer personify such \u201cinstincts,\u201d except for the purposes of literary embellishment, so we don\'t think of them \u201cexisting\u201d in a \u201cplace\u201d (like heaven, for example). But the idea that such instincts inhabit a space\u2014and that wars occur in that space\u2014is a metaphor of exceeding power and explanatory utility. Transpersonal motive forces do wage war with one another over vast spans of time; are each forced to come to terms with their powerful \u201copponents\u201d in the intrapsychic hierarchy. The battles between the different \u201cways of life\u201d (or different philosophies) that eternally characterize human societies can usefully be visualized as combat undertaken by different standards of value (and, therefore, by different hierarchies of motivation). The \u201cforces\u201d involved in such wars do not die, as they are \u201cimmortal\u201d: the human beings acting as \u201cpawns of the gods\u201d during such times are not so fortunate.\u201d","No one in the modern world may without objection express the opinion that existence would be bettered by the absence of Jews, blacks, Muslims, or Englishmen. Why, then, is it virtuous to propose that the planet might be better off, if there were fewer people on it? I can\u2019t help but see a skeletal, grinning face, gleeful at the possibility of the apocalypse, hiding not so very far behind such statements. And why does it so often seem to be the very people standing so visibly against prejudice who so often appear to feel obligated to denounce humanity itself?","To stand up straight with your shoulders back means building the ark that protects the world from the flood, guiding your people through the desert after they have escaped tyranny, making your way away from comfortable home and country, and speaking the prophetic word to those who ignore the widows and children. It means shouldering the cross that marks the X, the place where you and Being intersect so terribly.","It is far better to render Beings in your car competent than to protect them","Thus, not only is the state supporting one-sided radicalism, it is also supporting indoctrination. We do not teach our children that the world is flat. Neither should we teach them unsupported ideologically-predicated theories about the nature of men and women\u2014or the nature of hierarchy.","The more you open yourself up to the possibility that good things will happen the higher probability is that good things will in fact happen.","To straddle that fundamental duality is to be balanced: to have one foot firmly planted in order and security, and the other in chaos, possibility, growth and adventure.","you cease to utter falsehoods and live according to the dictates of your conscience, you can maintain your nobility, even when facing the ultimate threat; if you abide, truthfully and courageously, by the highest of ideals, you will be provided with more security and strength than will be offered by any short-sighted concentration on your own safety; if you live properly, fully, you can discover meaning so profound that it protects you even from the fear of death.","Thus, you should never sacrifice what you could be for what you are.","Prosaically, such sacrifice\u2014work\u2014is delay of gratification, but that\u2019s a very mundane phrase to describe something of such profound significance. The discovery that gratification could be delayed was simultaneously the discovery of time and, with it, causality (at least the causal force of voluntary human action). Long ago, in the dim mists of time, we began to realize that reality was structured as if it could be bargained with.","Here is the problem: Collect a hundred, or a thousand, of those, and your life is miserable and your marriage doomed. Do not pretend you are happy with something if you are not, and if a reasonable solution might, in principle, be negotiated. Have the damn fight. Unpleasant as that might be in the moment, it is one less straw on the camel\u2019s back. And that is particularly true for those daily events that everyone is prone to regard as trivial\u2014even the plates on which you eat your lunch. Life is what repeats, and it is worth getting what repeats right.","Then we would reunite, and share the results of our questioning: Here\u2019s how I was wrong\u2026. The problem with asking yourself such a question is that you must truly want the answer. And the problem with doing that is that you won\u2019t like the answer. When you are arguing with someone, you want to be right, and you want the other person to be wrong. Then it\u2019s them that has to sacrifice something and change, not you, and that\u2019s much preferable. If it\u2019s you that\u2019s wrong and you that must change, then you have to reconsider yourself\u2014your memories of the past, your manner of being in the present, and your plans for the future. Then you must resolve to improve and figure out how to do that. Then you actually have to do it. That\u2019s exhausting. It takes repeated practice, to instantiate the new perceptions and make the new actions habitual. It\u2019s much easier just not to realize, admit and engage. It\u2019s much easier to turn your attention away from the truth and remain wilfully blind.","begin by treating yourself as if you were someone you were responsible for helping.","People who know what to expect from one another can act together to tame the world.","In other words, you decide to act as if existence might be justified by its goodness\u2014if only you behaved properly. And it is that decision, that declaration of existential faith, that allows you to overcome nihilism, and resentment, and arrogance. It is that declaration of faith that keeps hatred of Being, with all its attendant evils, at bay. And, as for such faith: it is not at all the will to believe things that you know perfectly well to be false. Faith is not the childish belief in magic. That is ignorance or even willful blindness. It is instead the realization that the tragic irrationalities of life must be counterbalanced by an equally irrational commitment to the essential goodness of Being.","Sometimes, when people have a low opinion of their own worth\u2014or, perhaps, when they refuse responsibility for their lives\u2014they choose a new acquaintance, of precisely the type who proved troublesome in the past. Such people don\u2019t believe that they deserve any better\u2014so they don\u2019t go looking for it. Or, perhaps, they don\u2019t want the trouble of better. Freud called this a \u201crepetition compulsion. He thought of it as an unconscious drive to repeat the horrors of the past\u2014sometimes, perhaps, to formulate those horrors more precisely, sometimes to attempt more active mastery and sometimes, perhaps, because no alternatives beckon.\u201d","And even if it were possible to permanently banish everything threatening\u2014everything dangerous (and, therefore, everything challenging and interesting)\u2014that would mean only that another danger would emerge: that of permanent human infantilism and absolute uselessness. How could the nature of man ever reach its full potential without challenge and danger? How dull and contemptible would we become if there was no longer reason to pay attention? Maybe God thought His new creation would be able to handle the serpent, and considered its presence the lesser of two evils.","When untrammeled\u2014and encouraged\u2014we prefer to live on the edge. There, we can still be both confident in our experience and confronting the chaos that helps us develop. We\u2019re hard-wired, for that reason, to enjoy risk (some of us more than others). We feel invigorated and excited when we work to optimize our future performance, while playing in the present. Otherwise we lumber around, sloth-like, unconscious, unformed and careless.","I\'m not a fan of Positive Psychology, by the way, because happiness is basically extroversion minus neuroticism, and we knew that 15 years ago.","You may come to ask yourself, \u201cWhat should I do today? in a manner that means \u201cHow could I use my time to make things better, instead of worse?\u201d","When you move, everything is up in the air, at least for a while. It\u2019s stressful, but in the chaos there are new possibilities. People, including you, can\u2019t hem you in with their old notions. You get shaken out of your ruts. You can make new, better ruts, with people aiming at better things.","To do something, you have to VALUE something. It is a definitional issue. Because, to DO something, is to ACT OUT the proposition that the thing you are doing, the thing you are AIMING at, let\'s say, is PREFERABLE to the thing you have. And preferable means that you will do it.","Taking the easy way out or telling the truth\u2014those are not merely two different choices. They are different pathways through life. They are utterly different ways of existing.","read Dostoevsky\u2019s Crime and Punishment,","The order that is most real is the order that is most unchanging\u2014and that is not necessarily the order that is most easily seen. The leaf, when perceived, might blind the observer to the tree. The tree can blind him to the forest. And some things that are most real (such as the ever-present dominance hierarchy) cannot be \u201cseen at all.\u201d","Children can be damaged as much or more by a lack of incisive attention as they are by abuse, mental or physical. This is damage by omission, rather than commission, but it is no less severe and long-lasting. Children are damaged when their \u201cmercifully inattentive parents fail to make them sharp and observant and awake and leave them, instead, in an unconscious and undifferentiated state. Children are damaged when those charged with their care, afraid of any conflict or upset, no longer dare to correct them, and leave them without guidance. I can recognize such children on the street. They are doughy and unfocused and vague. They are leaden and dull instead of golden and bright. They are uncarved blocks, trapped in a perpetual state of waiting-to-be. Such children are chronically ignored by their peers. This is because they are not fun to play with. Adults tend to manifest the same attitude (although they will deny it desperately when pressed).\u201d","Old age and treachery can always overcome youth and skill.","Maybe your misery is the weapon you brandish in your hatred for those who rose upward while you waited and sank. Maybe your misery is your attempt to prove the world\'s injustice, instead of the evidence of your own sin, your missing of the mark, your conscious refusal to strive and live. Maybe your willingness to suffer in failure is inexhaustible, given what you use that suffering to prove. Maybe it\'s your revenge on Being. How exactly should I befriend you when you\'re in such a place? How could I? .... Maybe I should at least wait, to help you, until it\'s clear that you want to be helped.","You can only find out what you actually believe (rather than what you think you believe) by watching how you act.","How could the world be freed from the terrible dilemma of conflict, on the one hand, and psychological and social dissolution, on the other? The answer was this: through the elevation and development of the individual, and through the willingness of everyone to shoulder the burden of Being and to take the heroic path. We must each adopt as much responsibility as possible for individual life, society and the world. We must each tell the truth and repair what is in disrepair and break down and recreate what is old and outdated. It is in this manner that we can and must reduce the suffering that poisons the world. It\u2019s asking a lot. It\u2019s asking for everything. But the alternative\u2014the horror of authoritarian belief, the chaos of the collapsed state, the tragic catastrophe of the unbridled natural world, the existential angst and weakness of the purposeless individual\u2014is clearly worse.","It is the primary duty of parents to make their children socially desirable. That will provide the child with opportunity, self-regard, and security. It\'s more important even than fostering individual identity.","The idea that you can target an ethnic group with a collective crime, regardless of the specific innocence or guilt of the constituent elements of that group \u2014 there is absolutely nothing that\'s more racist than that.","Don\u2019t blame capitalism, the radical left, or the iniquity of your enemies. Don\u2019t reorganize the state until you have ordered your own experience. Have some humility. If you cannot bring peace to your household, how dare you try to rule a city?","Put the things you can control in order. Repair what is in disorder, and make what is already good better. It is possible that you can manage, if you are careful. People are very tough. People can survive through much pain and loss. But to persevere they must see the good in Being. If they lose that, that are truly lost.","Sometimes the defeat can have even more severe consequences. If a dominant lobster is badly defeated, its brain basically dissolves. Then it grows a new, subordinate\u2019s brain\u2014one more appropriate to its new, lowly position.8 Its original brain just isn\u2019t sophisticated to manage the transformation from king to bottom dog without virtually complete dissolution and regrowth. Anyone who has experienced a painful transformation after a serious defeat in romance or career may feel some sense of kinship with the once successful crustacean.","There is nothing so certain that it cannot vary. Even the sun itself has its cycles of instability. Likewise, there is nothing so mutable that it cannot be fixed. Every revolution produces a new order. Every death is, simultaneously, a metamorphosis.","Why? Because the consequence of remaining silent is worse. Of course, it\u2019s easier in the moment to stay silent and avoid conflict. But in the long term, that\u2019s deadly. When you have something to say, silence is a lie\u2014and tyranny feeds on lies. When should you push back against oppression, despite the danger? When you start nursing secret fantasies of revenge; when your life is being poisoned and your imagination fills with the wish to devour and destroy.","If I stay in an unhealthy relationship with you, perhaps it\u2019s because I\u2019m too weak-willed and indecisive to leave, but I don\u2019t want to know it. Thus, I continue helping you, and console myself with my pointless martyrdom. Maybe I can then conclude, about myself, \u201cSomeone that self-sacrificing, that willing to help someone\u2014that has to be a good person. Not so. It might be just a person trying to look good pretending to solve what appears to be a difficult problem instead of actually being good and addressing something real. Maybe instead of continuing our friendship I should just go off somewhere, get my act together, and lead by example.\u201d","It is because of of Freud, Jung, Nietzsche\u2014and Orwell\u2014that I always wonder, \u201cWhat, then, do you stand against? whenever I hear someone say, too loudly, \u201cI stand for this!\u201d The question seems particularly relevant if the same someone is complaining, criticizing, or trying to change someone else\u2019s behaviour.\u201d","No tree can grow to Heaven, adds the ever-terrifying Carl Gustav Jung, psychoanalyst extraordinaire, \u201cunless its roots reach down to Hell.\u201d134\u201d","there are catastrophes lurking at the extremes of every moral continuum.","Loss of group-centred belief renders life chaotic, miserable, intolerable; presence of group-centred belief makes conflict with other groups inevitable. In the West, we have been withdrawing from our tradition-, religion-, and even nation-centred cultures, partly to decrease the danger of group conflict. But we are increasingly falling prey to the desperation of meaningless, and that is no improvement at all.","If you can bite, you generally don\u2019t have to.","You may find that if you attend to these moral obligations, once you have placed \u201cmake the world better at the top of your value hierarchy, you experience ever-deepening meaning. It\u2019s not bliss. It\u2019s not happiness. It is something more like atonement for the criminal fact of your fractured and damaged Being. It\u2019s payment of the debt you owe for the insane and horrible miracle of your existence. It\u2019s how you remember the Holocaust. It\u2019s how you make amends for the pathology of history.

Our actual situations, however, are almost always more complex. If things or situations were straightforwardly or simply positive or negative, good or bad, we would not have to make judgements regarding them, would not have to think about our behavior, and how and when it should be modified-- indeed, would not have to think at all. We are faced, however, with the constant problem of ambivalence in meaning, which is to say that a thing or situation might be bad and good simultaneously (or good in two conflicting manners; or bad, in two conflicting manners).","human health is a matter of moral action, perhaps more than it is a matter of anything else","We are all human.

And what is it, precisely, that motivates such evil? It doesn\u2019t make itself manifest merely in consequence of the hard lot of life. It doesn\u2019t even emerge, simply, because of failure itself, or because of the disappointment and bitterness that failure often and understandably engenders. But the hard lot of life, magnified by the consequence of continually rejected sacrifices (however poorly conceptualized; however half-heartedly executed)? That will bend and twist people into the truly monstrous forms who then begin, consciously, to work evil; who then begin to generate for themselves and others little besides pain and suffering (and who do it for the sake of that pain and suffering). In that manner, a truly vicious circle takes hold: begrudging sacrifice, half-heartedly undertaken; rejection of that sacrifice by God or by reality (take your pick); angry resentment, generated by that rejection; descent into bitterness and the desire for revenge; sacrifice undertaken even more begrudgingly, or refused altogether.

What might this mean? It could just mean that God is a patriarchal tyrant, as politically motivated interpretations of the ancient story insist. I think it\u2019s\u2014merely descriptive.Merely. And here is why: As human beings evolved, the brains that eventually gave rise to self-consciousness expanded tremendously. This produced an evolutionary arms race between fetal head and female pelvis.56 The female graciously widened her hips, almost to the point where running would no longer be possible. The baby, for his part, allowed himself to be born more than a year early, compared to other mammals of his size, and evolved a semi-collapsible head.57 This was and is a painful adjustment for both. The essentially fetal baby is almost completely dependent on his mother for everything during that first year. The programmability of his massive brain means that he must be trained until he is eighteen (or thirty) before being pushed out of the nest. This is to say nothing of the woman\u2019s consequential pain in childbirth, and high risk of death for mother and infant alike. This all means that women pay a high price for pregnancy and child-rearing, particularly in the early stages, and that one of the inevitable consequences is increased dependence upon the sometimes unreliable and always problematic good graces of men.","MAKE FRIENDS WITH PEOPLE WHO WANT THE BEST FOR YOU","All she\u2014he\u2014they\u2014or we\u2014must do to ensure such an outcome is nothing: don\u2019t notice, don\u2019t react, don\u2019t attend, don\u2019t discuss, don\u2019t consider, don\u2019t work for peace, don\u2019t take responsibility.

Virtue signalling is, quite possibly, our commonest vice.)","Alone, trying to calm down, we would each ask ourselves the same single question: What had we each done to contribute to the situation we were arguing about? However small, however distant \u2026 we had each made some error. Then we would reunite, and share the results of our questioning: Here\u2019s how I was wrong \u2026.The problem with asking yourself such a question is that you must truly want the answer. And the problem with doing that is that you won\u2019t like theanswer. When you are arguing with someone, you want to be right, and you want the other person to be wrong. Then it\u2019s them that has to sacrifice something and change, not you, and that\u2019s much preferable. If it\u2019s you that\u2019s wrong and you that must change, then you have to reconsider yourself\u2014your memories of the past, your manner of being in the present, and your plans for the future. Then you must resolve to improve and figure out how to do that. Then you actually have to do it. That\u2019s exhausting. It takes repeated practice, to instantiate the new perceptions and make the new actions habitual. It\u2019s much easier just not to realize, admit and engage. It\u2019s much easier to turn your attention away from the truth and remain wilfully blind.","Though thirty spokes may form the wheel, it is the hole within the hub which gives the wheel utility.

Or maybe you\u2019re saving someone because you want to convince yourself that the strength of your character is more than just a side effect of your luck and birthplace.

Often they are people whose fathers were excessively angry and controlling. Psychological forces are never unidimensional in their value, however, and the truly appalling potential of anger and aggression to produce cruelty and mayhem are balanced by the ability of those primordial forces to push back against oppression, speak truth, and motivate resolute movement forward in times of strife, uncertainty and danger.","In other words, you decide to act as if existence might be justified by its goodness\u2014if only you behaved properly. And it is that decision, that declaration of existential faith, that allows you to overcome nihilism, and resentment, and arrogance. It is that declaration of faith that keeps hatred of Being, with all its attendant evils, at bay. And, as for such faith: it is not at all the will to believe things that you know perfectly well to be false. Faith is not the childish belief in magic. That is ignorance or even willful blindness. It is instead the realization that the tragic irrationalities of life must be counterbalanced by an equally irrational commitment to the essential goodness of Being. It is simultaneously the will to dare set your sights at the unachievable, and to sacrifice everything, including (and most importantly) your life.","Everything\u2014that\u2019s far too much. It was specific things that fell apart, not everything; identifiable beliefs failed; particular actions were false and inauthentic.","The \u201cnatural human tendency to respond to the stranger, the strange idea and the creative individual with fear and aggression can be more easily comprehended, once it is understood that these diverse phenomena share categorical identity with the \u201cnatural disaster.\u201d","If you bend everything totally, blindly and willfully towards the attainment of a goal, and only that goal, you will never be able to discover if another goal would serve you, and the world, better.

It should be one you don\'t know the answer to and then you should be studying and writing like mad and reading everything you can get your hands on to see if you can actually grapple with the problem and come to some solution and you should walk the reader as well through your process of thinking.","Viktor Frankl, the psychiatrist and Nazi concentration camp survivor who wrote the classic Man\u2019s Search for Meaning, drew a similar social-psychological conclusion: deceitful, inauthentic individual existence is the precursor to social totalitarianism. Sigmund Freud, for his part, analogously believed that \u201crepression contributed in a non-trivial manner to the development of mental illness (and the difference between repression of truth and a lie is a matter of degree, not kind). Alfred Adler knew it was lies that bred sickness. C.G. Jung knew that moral problems plagued his patients, and that such problems were caused by untruth. All these thinkers, all centrally concerned with pathology both individual and cultural, came to the same conclusion: lies warp the structure of Being. Untruth corrupts the soul and the state alike, and one form of corruption feeds the other.\u201d","It\u2019s a reflection of the genuine constraints of unfortunate circumstances. When operating at the bottom, the ancient brain counter assumes that even the smallest unexpected impediment might produce an uncontrollable chain of negative events, which will have to be handled alone, as useful friends are rare indeed, on society\u2019s fringes. You will therefore continually sacrifice what you could otherwise physically store for the future, using it up on heightened readiness and the possibility of immediate panicked action in the present.","Make friends with people who want the best for you.","What should you do, when you don\'t know what to do?

I soon divided myself into two parts: one that spoke, and one, more detached, that paid attention and judged. I soon came to realize that almost everything I said was untrue. I had motives for saying these things: I wanted to win arguments and gain status and impress people and get what I wanted. I was using language to bend and twist the world into delivering what I thought was necessary. But I was a fake.","We are thus eternally caught between the most diamantine rock and the hardest of places: loss of group-centred belief renders life chaotic, miserable, intolerable; presence of group-centred belief makes conflict with other groups inevitable. In the West, we have been withdrawing from our tradition-, religion- and even nation-centred cultures, partly to decrease the danger of group conflict. But we are increasingly falling prey to the desperation of meaninglessness, and that is no improvement at all.","Then there is the conversation where one participant is trying to attain victory for his point of view. This is yet another variant of the dominance-hierarchy conversation. During such a conversation, which often tends toward the ideological, the speaker endeavours to (1) denigrate or ridicule the viewpoint of anyone holding a contrary position, (2) use selective evidence while doing so and, finally, (3) impress the listeners (many of whom are already occupying the same ideological space) with the validity of his assertions. The goal is to gain support for a comprehensive, unitary, oversimplified world-view. Thus, the purpose of the conversation is to make the case that not thinking is the correct tack.","Order is not enough.

Thus, instead of narcissistically inflating their own importance, they don\u2019t value themselves at all, and they don\u2019t take care of themselves with attention and skill. It seems that people often don\u2019t really believe that they deserve the best care, personally speaking. They are excruciatingly aware of their own faults and inadequacies, real and exaggerated, and ashamed and doubtful of their own value. They believe that other people shouldn\u2019t suffer, and they will work diligently and altruistically to help them alleviate it. They extend the same courtesy even to the animals they are acquainted with\u2014but not so easily to themselves.","I have clients who are nowhere near as insane as their family is, but they\'re the people who have been targeted with the mental illnesses because that\u2019s convenient for everyone involved.","This is the great Freudian Oedipal nightmare.49 It is far better to render Beings in your care competent than to protect them. And even if it were possible to permanently banish everything threatening\u2014everything dangerous (and, therefore, everything challenging and interesting), that would mean only that another danger would emerge: that of permanent human infantilism and absolute uselessness.","There is no shortage of oppressors among the downtrodden, even if, given their lowly positions, many of them are only tyrannical wannabes.","When you are fighting against something than there\'s something else you are not doing.","the line dividing good and evil cuts through the heart of every human being.48","means that people, unsettled by their vulnerability, eternally fear to tell the truth, to mediate between chaos and order, and to manifest their destiny.","if you really want to get killed, the best thing to do is go drink with a family member","He whose life has a why can bear almost any how.","The escape from tyranny is often followed not by Paradise, but by a sojourn in the desert, aimless, confused and deprived.","It\'s peace that\'s the mystery.

They aren\u2019t social or hierarchical (except in passing). They are only semi-domesticated. They don\u2019t do tricks. They are friendly on their own terms. Dogs have been tamed, but cats have made a decision. They appear willing to interact with people, for some strange reasons of their own. To me, cats are a manifestation of nature, of Being, in an almost pure form. Furthermore, they are a form of Being that looks at human beings and approves.","You\u2019re in order, when you have a loyal friend, a trustworthy ally. When the same person betrays you, sells you out, you move from the daytime world of clarity and light to the dark underworld of chaos, confusion and despair.","I have been searching for decades for certainty. It has not been solely a matter of thinking, in the creative sense, but of thinking and then attempting to undermine and destroy those thoughts, followed by careful consideration and conservation of those that survive. It is identification of a path forward through a swampy passage, searching for stones to stand on safely below the murky surface. However, even though I regard the inevitability of suffering and its exaggeration by malevolence as unshakable truths, I believe even more deeply that people have the ability to transcend their suffering, psychologically, and practically, and to constrain their own malevolence, as well as the evils that characterise the social and the natural worlds.","Who is subordinate to whom in a marriage? After all, each might reason, as people commonly do, that such an arrangement is a zero-sum game, with one winner and one loser. But a relationship does not have to be and should not be a question of one or the other as winner, or even each alternating in that status, in an approximation of fairness. Instead, the couple can decide that each and both are subordinate to a principle, a higher-order principle, which constitutes their union in the spirit of illumination and truth. That ghostly figure, the ideal union of what is best in both personalities, should be constantly regarded as the ruler of the marriage\u2014and, indeed, as something as close to divine as might be practically approached by fallible individuals\u201d","Psychotherapy is not advice. Advice is what you get when the person you\u2019re talking with about something horrible and complicated wishes you would just shut up and go away.

His displays of ignorance, inexperience, and lack of skill may still sometimes be rightly attributed to irresponsibility and condemned, justly, by others.

Much that is great starts small, ignorant, and useless. This lesson permeates popular as well as classical or traditional culture.","Thus, they did not concern themselves with what the world was, as a scientist might have it, but with how a human being should act. I suggested that our ancestors portrayed the world as a stage\u2014a drama\u2014instead of a place of objects.

The totalitarian says, in essence, \u201cYou must rely on faith in what you already know. But that is not what saves. What saves is the willingness to learn from what you don\u2019t know.

The totalitarian denies the necessity for the individual to take ultimate responsibility for Being.\u201d","And the story suggests something more: unchaperoned, and left to our own untutored judgment, we are quick to aim low and worship qualities that are beneath us\u2014in this case, an artificial animal that brings out our own animal instincts in a completely unregulated way. The old Hebrew story makes it clear how the ancients felt about our prospects for civilized behaviour in the absence of rules that seek to elevate our gaze and raise our standards.","Don\u2019t think that it is easier to surround yourself with good healthy people than with bad unhealthy people. It\u2019s not. A good, healthy person is an ideal. It requires strength and daring to stand up near such a person. Have some humility. Have some courage.

Then you ask yourself, \u201cWhat could I do, that I would do, that would accomplish that, and what small thing would I like as a reward? Then you do what you have decided to do, even if you do it badly. Then you give yourself that damn coffee, in triumph. Maybe you feel a bit stupid about it, but you do it anyway.

These genes code for new proteins. These proteins are the building blocks for new structures in the brain.

Do they wake up in the morning at approximately the time the typical person wakes up, and at the same time every day? If the answer is no, fixing that is the first thing I recommend. It doesn\u2019t matter so much if they go to bed at the same time each evening, but waking up at a consistent hour is a necessity. Anxiety and depression cannot be easily treated if the sufferer has unpredictable daily routines. The systems that mediate negative emotion are tightly tied to the properly cyclical circadian rhythms. The next thing I ask about is breakfast. I counsel my clients to eat a fat and protein-heavy breakfast as soon as possible after they awaken (no simple carbohydrates, no sugars, as they are digested too rapidly, and produce a blood-sugar spike and rapid dip). This is because anxious and depressed people are already stressed, particularly if their lives have not been under control for a good while. Their bodies are therefore primed to hypersecrete insulin, if they engage in any complex or demanding activity. If they do so after fasting all night and before eating, the excess insulin in their bloodstream will mop up all their blood sugar. Then they become hypoglycemic and psych\u200bophys\u200biologi\u200bcally unstable.","There\u2019s some real utility in gratitude.

This doesn\u2019t mean \u201cmake yourself stupid. It means the opposite. It means instead that you must quit manoeuvring and calculating and conniving and scheming and enforcing and demanding and avoiding and ignoring and punishing. It means you must place your old strategies aside.

The price we pay for that involvement is the inevitable creation of hierarchies of success, while the inevitable consequence is difference in outcome. Absolutely equality would therefore require the sacrifice of value itself\u2014and then there would be nothing worth living for.

If I fail to do so, I will end up a slave, and the other person a tyrant. What good is that? It is much better for any relationship when both partners are strong. Furthermore, there is little difference between standing up and speaking for yourself, when you are being bullied or otherwise tormented and enslaved, and standing up and speaking for someone else. As Jung points out, this means embracing and loving the sinner who is yourself, as much as forgiving and aiding someone else who is stumbling and imperfect.","There is another, closely allied form of conversation, where neither speaker is listening in the least to the other.

Aristotle defined the virtues simply as the ways of behaving that are most conducive to happiness in life. Vice was defined as the ways of behaving least conducive to happiness. He observed that the virtues always aim for balance and avoid the extremes of the vices. Aristotle studied the virtues and the vices in his Nicomachean Ethics. It was a book based on experience and observation, not conjecture, about the kind of happiness that was possible for human beings.

Inconveniences interfere with the integrity of our plans\u2014so we tend to pretend that they are not there.

By their nature, they are harder to ignore\u2014although that does not stop us from trying to do so.Inconveniences are common; unfortunately, so are catastrophes\u2014self-induced and otherwise. We are adapted to catastrophes, like inconveniences, as constant environmental features. We can resolve catastrophe, just as we can cope with inconvenience\u2014although at higher cost.

Carl Rogers, one of the twentieth century\u2019s great psychotherapists, knew something about listening. He wrote, \u201cThe great majority of us cannot listen; we find ourselves compelled to evaluate, because listening is too dangerous. The first requirement is courage, and we do not always have it.159 He knew that listening could transform people. On that, Rogers commented, \u201cSome of you may be feeling that you listen well to people, and that you have never seen such results. The chances are very great indeed that your listening has not been of the type I have described.\u201d He suggested that his readers conduct a short experiment when they next found themselves in a dispute: \u201cStop the discussion for a moment, and institute this rule: \u2018Each person can speak up for himself only after he has first restated the ideas and feelings of the previous speaker accurately, and to that speaker\u2019s satisfaction.\u2019\u201d I have found this technique very useful, in my private life and in my practice. I routinely summarize what people have said to me, and ask them if I have understood properly. Sometimes they accept my summary. Sometimes I am offered a small correction. Now and then I am wrong completely. All of that is good to know.\u201d","El sentido de nuestras limitaciones no es el sufrimiento; es la existencia misma.

Maybe you can do this in the morning, as you sit on the edge of your bed. Maybe you can try, the night before, when you are preparing to sleep. Ask yourself for a voluntary contribution. If you ask nicely, and listen carefully, and don\u2019t try any treachery, you might be offered one. Do this every day, for a while. Then do it for the rest of your life. Soon you will find yourself in a different situation. Now you will be asking yourself, habitually, \u201cWhat could I do, that I would do, to make Life a little better? You are not dictating to yourself what \u201cbetter\u201d must be. You are not being a totalitarian, or a utopian, even to yourself, because you have learned from the Nazis and the Soviets and the Maoists and from your own experience that being a totalitarian is a bad thing. Aim high. Set your sights on the betterment of Being. Align yourself, in your soul, with Truth and the Highest Good. There is habitable order to establish and beauty to bring into existence. There is evil to overcome, suffering to ameliorate, and yourself to better.\u201d","Dogmatic belief in the central axioms of Christianity (that Christ\u2019s crucifixion redeemed the world; that salvation was reserved for the hereafter; that salvation could not be achieved through works) had three mutually reinforcing consequences: First, devaluation of the significance of earthly life, as only the hereafter mattered. This also meant that it had become acceptable to overlook and shirk responsibility for the suffering that existed in the here-and-now; Second, passive acceptance of the status quo, because salvation could not be earned in any case through effort in this life (a consequence that Marx also derided, with his proposition that religion was the opiate of the masses); and, finally, third, the right of the believer to reject any real moral burden (outside of the stated belief in salvation through Christ), because the Son of God had already done all the important work. It was for such reasons that Dostoevsky, who was a great influence on Nietzsche, also criticized institutional Christianity (although he arguably managed it in a more ambiguous but also more sophisticated manner). In his masterwork, The Brothers Karamazov, Dostoevsky has his atheist superman, Ivan, tell a little story, \u201cThe Grand Inquisitor.145 A brief review is in order.\u201d","I recently watched a talent show featuring a mime who taped his mouth shut and did something ridiculous with oven mitts.

It\u2019s basically what God tells Adam and Eve, immediately before he kicks them out of Paradise. Unto the woman he said, I will greatly multiply thy sorrow and thy conception; in sorrow thou shalt bring forth children; and thy desire shall be to thy husband, and he shall rule over thee. And unto Adam he said, Because thou hast hearkened unto the voice of thy wife, and hast eaten of the tree, of which I commanded thee, saying, Thou shalt not eat of it: cursed is the ground for thy sake; in sorrow shalt thou eat of it all the days of thy life; Thorns also and thistles shall it bring forth to thee; and thou shalt eat the herb of the field; By the sweat of your brow you will eat your food until you return to the ground, since from it you were taken; for dust you are and to dust you will return.

The first advantage is that I genuinely come to understand what the person is saying. Of this, Rogers notes, \u201cSounds simple, doesn\u2019t it? But if you try it you will discover it is one of the most difficult things you have ever tried to do. If you really understand a person in this way, if you are willing to enter his private world and see the way life appears to him, you run the risk of being changed yourself.

However, the majority of people who were abused as children do not abuse their own children.

You will also be much better at withstanding your own doubts.","you must decide whether you want to be right or you want to have peace.216 You must decide whether to insist upon the absolute correctness of your view, or to listen and negotiate.","The hard workers who surround him start to feel betrayed. \u201cWhy am I breaking myself into pieces striving to finish this project, each thinks, \u201cwhen my new team member never breaks a sweat?\u201d The same thing happens when well-meaning counsellors place a delinquent teen among comparatively civilized peers. The delinquency spreads, not the stability.65 Down is a lot easier than up.\u201d","And finally, learn more about the business\u2014or your competitors\u2014than you already know. Doing so will make you invaluable\u2014a veritable lynchpin. People will notice that and begin to appreciate your hard-earned merits.","What does that imply? It might be that the true meaning of life is available for discovery, if it can be discovered at all, by each individual, alone\u2014although in communication with others, past and present.","You might object, \u201cWell, I just could not manage to take on something that important. What if you began to build yourself into a person who could? You could start by trying to solve a small problem\u2014something that is bothering you, that you think you could fix. You could start by confronting a dragon of just the size that you are likely to defeat. A tiny serpent might not have had the time to hoard a lot of gold, but there might still be some treasure to be won, along with a reasonable probability of succeeding in such a quest (and not too much chance of a fiery or toothsome death).\u201d","Children in father-absent homes are four times as likely to be poor.","On many occasions in our nearly thirty years of marriage my wife and I have had a disagreement\u2014sometimes a deep disagreement. Our unity appeared to be broken, at some unknowably profound level, and we were not able to easily resolve the rupture by talking. We became trapped, instead, in emotional, angry and anxious argument. We agreed that when such circumstances arose we would separate, briefly: she to one room, me to another. This was often quite difficult, because it is hard to disengage in the heat of an argument, when anger generates the desire to defeat and win. But it seemed better than risking the consequences of a dispute that threatened to spiral out of control. Alone, trying to calm down, we would each ask ourselves the same single question: What had we each done to contribute to the situation we were arguing about? However small, however distant\u2026we had each made some error. Then we would reunite, and share the results of our questioning: Here\u2019s how I was wrong\u2026. The problem with asking yourself such a question is that you must truly want the answer. And the problem with doing that is that you won\u2019t like the answer. When you are arguing with someone, you want to be right, and you want the other person to be wrong. Then it\u2019s them that has to sacrifice something and change, not you, and that\u2019s much preferable. If it\u2019s you that\u2019s wrong and you that must change, then you have to reconsider yourself\u2014your memories of the past, your manner of being in the present, and your plans for the future. Then you must resolve to improve and figure out how to do that. Then you actually have to do it. That\u2019s exhausting. It takes repeated practice, to instantiate the new perceptions and make the new actions habitual. It\u2019s much easier just not to realize, admit and engage. It\u2019s much easier to turn your attention away from the truth and remain wilfully blind. But it\u2019s at such a point that you must decide whether you want to be right or you want to have peace.216 You must decide whether to insist upon the absolute correctness of your view, or to listen and negotiate. You don\u2019t get peace by being right. You just get to be right, while your partner gets to be wrong\u2014defeated and wrong. Do that ten thousand times and your marriage will be over (or you will wish it was). To choose the alternative\u2014to seek peace\u2014you have to decide that you want the answer, more than you want to be right. That\u2019s the way out of the prison of your stubborn preconceptions. That\u2019s the prerequisite for negotiation. That\u2019s to truly abide by the principle of Rule 2 (Treat yourself like someone you are responsible for helping).","You are not morally obliged to support someone who is making the world a worse place. Quite the opposite. You should choose people who want things to be better, not worse.","A defeated wolf, for example, will roll over on its back, exposing its throat to the victor, who will not then deign to tear it out.","I believe that government can, sometimes, be a force for good, as well as the necessary arbiter of a small set of necessary rules. Nonetheless, I do not understand why our society is providing public funding to institutions and educators whose stated, conscious and explicit aim is the demolition of the culture that supports them.","The scientific world of matter can be reduced, in some sense, to its fundamental constituent elements: molecules, atoms, even quarks. However, the world of experience has primal constituents, as well. These are the necessary elements whose interactions define drama and fiction. One of these is chaos. Another is order. The third (as there are three) is the process that mediates between the two, which appears identical to what modern people call consciousness.","Not all talking is thinking. Nor does all listening foster transformation. There are other motives for both, some of which produce much less valuable, counterproductive and even dangerous outcomes. There is the conversation, for example, where one participant is speaking merely to establish or confirm his place in the dominance hierarchy. One person begins by telling a story about some interesting occurrence, recent or past, that involved something good, bad or surprising enough to make the listening worthwhile. The other person, now concerned with his or her potentially substandard status as less-interesting individual, immediately thinks of something better, worse, or more surprising to relate. This isn\u2019t one of those situations where two conversational participants are genuinely playing off each other, riffing on the same themes, for the mutual enjoyment of both (and everyone else). This is jockeying for position, pure and simple. You can tell when one of those conversations is occurring. They are accompanied by a feeling of embarrassment among speakers and listeners alike, all of whom know that something false and exaggerated has just been said.","(I know someone who was actually chased by a squirrel.)","Cultivating judgment about the difference between virtue and vice is the beginning of wisdom, something that can never be out of date.","Statistics is not an exact science. It is an investigative technique.","It may well be, therefore, that the true meaning of life is not to be found in what is objective, but in what is subjective (but still universal).","These gods are the axioms and foundational beliefs that must be accepted, a priori, rather than proven, before the belief system can be adopted, and when accepted and applied to the world allow the illusion to prevail that knowledge has been produced.","Low serotonin means less happiness, more pain and anxiety, more illness, and a shorter lifespan\u2014among humans, just as among crustaceans","Fatherless children are at much greater risk for drug and alcohol abuse.

Well, that\'s easy. You virtually always sacrifice the present for the future.","There is another, closely allied form of conversation, where neither speaker is listening in the least to the other. Instead, each is using the time occupied by the current speaker to conjure up what he or she will say next, which will often be something off-topic, because the person anxiously waiting to speak has not been listening. This can and will bring the whole conversational train to a shuddering halt. At this point, it is usual for those who were on board during the crash to remain silent, and look occasionally and in a somewhat embarrassed manner at each other, until everyone leaves, or someone thinks of something witty and puts Humpty Dumpty together again.","No one finds a match so perfect that the need for continued attention and work vanishes (and, besides, if you found the perfect person, he or she would run away from ever-so-imperfect you in justifiable horror).","the suffering and malevolence that characterize life are real, with the terrible consequences of the real\u2014and our ability to solve problems, by confronting them and taking them on, is also real.

Thus, we can have our cake and eat it, too.","It is for this reason that we voluntarily and happily place limitations on ourselves.

This is no perverse realm of post-existence torture for political enemies. This is an abstract idea, and abstractions are often more real than what they represent. The idea that hell exists in some metaphysical manner is not only ancient, and pervasive; it\u2019s true. Hell is eternal. It has always existed. It exists now.

If I fail to do so, I will end up a slave, and the other person a tyrant. What good is that?\u201d","The idea that life is suffering is a relatively universal truism of religious thinking.

There are many ways that a target can be missed. Frequently, in my clinical practice\u2014and in my personal life\u2014I observed that people did not get what they needed (or, equally importantly perhaps, what they wanted) because they never made it clear to themselves or others what that was. It is impossible to hit a target, after all, unless you aim at it.

This story has a clear psychological meaning\u2014a metaphorical meaning\u2014in addition to whatever else material and metaphysical alike it might signify. It means that Christ is forever He who determines to take personal responsibility for the full depth of human depravity. It means that Christ is eternally He who is willing to confront and deeply consider and risk the temptations posed by the most malevolent elements of human nature. It means that Christ is always he who is willing to confront evil\u2014consciously, fully and voluntarily\u2014in the form that dwelt simultaneously within Him and in the world.

Religion concerns itself not with (mere) right and wrong, but with good and evil themselves - with the archetypes of right and wrong. Relgion concerns itself with the domain of value, ultimate value. That is not the scientific domain. It is not the domain of emperical description. The people who wrote the Bible, for example, weren\'t scientists. They couldn\'t have been scientists, even if they had wanted to be. The viewpoints, methods and practices of science hadn\'t been formulated when the Bible was written.","We thought it over, and drew a conclusion: The successful among us delay gratification.

These gods are the axioms and foundational beliefs that must be accepted, a priori, rather than proven, before the belief system can be adopted, and when accepted and applied to the world allow the illusion to prevail that knowledge has been produced.","Before the dawn of the scientific worldview, reality was construed differently. Being was understood as a place of action, not a place of things.31 It was understood as something more akin to story or drama. That story or drama was lived, subjective experience, as it manifested itself moment to moment in the consciousness of every living person.","The world can be validly construed as forum for action, or as place of things.The former manner of interpretation \u2013 more primordial, and less clearly understood \u2013 finds its expression in the arts or humanities, in ritual, drama, literature, and mythology. The world as forum for action is a place of value, a place where all things have meaning. This meaning, which is shaped as a consequence of social interaction, is implication for action, or \u2013 at a higher level of analysis \u2013 implication for the configuration of the interpretive schema that produces or guides action.The latter manner of interpretation \u2013 the world as place of things \u2013 finds its formal expression in the methods and theories of science. Science allows for increasingly precise determination of the consensually validatable properties of things, and for efficient utilization of precisely-determined things as tools (once the direction such use is to take has been determined, through application of more fundamental narrative processes).No complete world-picture can be generated, without use of both modes of construal. The fact that one mode is generally set at odds with the other means only that the nature of their respective domains remains insufficiently discriminated. Adherents of the mythological world-view tend to regard the statements of their creeds as indistinguishable from empirical \u201cfact, even though such statements were generally formulated long before the notion of objective reality emerged. Those who, by contrast, accept the scientific perspective \u2013 who assume that it is, or might become, complete \u2013 forget that an impassable gulf currently divides what is from what should be.\u201d","La seguridad de la sociedad predecible proporciona un ant\xeddoto al miedo, pero una sociedad demasiado r\xedgida garantiza que tarde o temprano se producir\xe1 su propia destrucci\xf3n.","He whose life has a why can bear almost any how.61\u201d","Aim at something.

It is most effective to utilize a major motivational system or large-scale sociological fact or conjecture for such purposes. It is also good to select those explanatory principles for an unstated negative, resentful, and destructive reason, and then make discussion of the latter and the reason for their existence taboo for the ideologue and his or her followers (to say nothing of the critics). Next, the faux theorist spins a post-hoc theory about how every phenomenon, no matter how complex, can be considered a secondary consequence of the new, totalizing system. Finally, a school of thought emerges to propagate the methods of this algorithmic reduction (particularly when the thinker is hoping to attain dominance in the conceptual and the real worlds), and those who refuse to adopt the algorithm or who criticize its use are tacitly or explicitly demonized.","Life is in truth very hard.

Osiris, however, was vulnerable to overthrow and banishment to the underworld by Set, his evil, scheming brother. The Egyptians represented in story the fact that social organizations ossify with time, and tend towards willful blindness. Osiris would not see his brother\u2019s true character, even though he could have. Set waits and, at an opportune moment, attacks. He hacks Osiris into pieces, and scatters the divine remains through the kingdom. He sends his brother\u2019s spirit to the underworld.

Therefore take no thought, saying, What shall we eat? or, What shall we drink? or, Wherewithal shall we be clothed? For your heavenly Father knoweth that ye have need of all these things. But seek ye first the kingdom of God, and his righteousness; and all these things shall be added unto you (Matthew 6:28-6:33). What does all that mean? Orient yourself properly. Then\u2014and only then\u2014concentrate on the day. Set your sights at the Good, the Beautiful, and the True, and then focus pointedly and carefully on the concerns of each moment. Aim continually at Heaven while you work diligently on Earth. Attend fully to the future, in that manner, while attending fully to the present. Then you have the best chance of perfecting both.","Before the dawn of the scientific worldview, reality was construed differently.

It takes nothing into account. It\u2019s immature and irresponsible. Meaning is its mature replacement. Meaning emerges when impulses are regulated, organized and unified. Meaning emerges from the interplay between the possibilities of the world and the value structure operating within that world. If the value structure is aimed at the betterment of Being, the meaning revealed will be life-sustaining. It will provide the antidote for chaos and suffering. It will make everything matter. It will make everything better.","You need to map your path. You need to know where you were, so that you do not repeat the mistakes of the past. You need to know where you are, or you will not be able to draw a line from your starting point to your destination.

The Egyptians also worshipped Horus, the son of Osiris. Horus took the twin forms of a falcon, the most visually acute of all creatures, and the still-famous hieroglyphic single Egyptian eye (as alluded to in Rule 7). Osiris is tradition, aged and willfully blind. Horus, his son, could and would, by contrast, see. Horus was the god of attention. That is not the same as rationality. Because he paid attention, Horus could perceive and triumph against the evils of Set, his uncle, albeit at great cost. When Horus confronts Set, they have a terrible battle. Before Set\u2019s defeat and banishment from the kingdom, he tears out one of his nephew\u2019s eyes. But the eventually victorious Horus takes back the eye. Then he does something truly unexpected: he journeys voluntarily to the underworld and gives the eye to his father.","Any idiot can choose a frame of time within which nothing matters.","Chaos and order make up the eternal, transcendent environment of the living.","Aggression underlies the drive to be outstanding, to be unstoppable, to compete, to win\u2014to be actively virtuous, at least along one dimension.","People think they think, but it\'s not true.

There are just people out there who are damaged, quite severely, although not always irreparably, and with a fair bit of individual idiosyncrasy. Apart from that, if there was someone out there who was perfect, they would take one look at you and run away screaming!

It is for this reason that enlightenment is so rare.\u201d","Christ takes a different path. His sojourn in the desert is the dark night of the soul\u2014a deeply human and universal human experience. It\u2019s the journey to that place each of us goes when things fall apart, friends and family are distant, hopelessness and despair reign, and black nihilism beckons.","After that comes the arrogance and sense of superiority that inevitably accompanies the production of successful lies (hypothetically successful lies\u2014and that is one of the greatest dangers: apparently everyone is fooled, so everyone is stupid, except me. Everyone is stupid and fooled, by me\u2014so I can get away with whatever I want). Finally, there is the proposition: \u201cBeing itself is susceptible to my manipulations. Thus, it deserves no respect.","cualquier jerarqu\xeda engendra ganadores y perdedores.

More importantly, however, you will acquire the information that allows your goal itself to transform. A totalitarian never asks, \u201cWhat if my current ambition is in error? He treats it, instead, as the Absolute. It becomes his God, for all intents and purposes. It constitutes his highest value. It regulates his emotions and motivational states, and determines his thoughts. All people serve their ambition.\u201d","To use the dramatic conceptualization of our ancestors: It is the most fundamental convictions that must die\u2014must be sacrificed\u2014when the relationship with God has been disrupted (when the presence of undue and often intolerable suffering, for example, indicates that something has to change). This is to say nothing other than that the future can be made better if the proper sacrifices take place in the present. No other animal has ever figured this out, and it took us untold hundreds of thousands of years to do it. It took further eons of observation and hero-worship, and then millennia of study, to distill that idea into a story. It then took additional vast stretches of time to assess that story, to incorporate it, so that we now can simply say, \u201cIf you are disciplined and privilege the future over the present you can change the structure of reality in your favour.","Life is suffering. The Buddha stated that, explicitly. Christians portray the same sentiment imagistically, with the divine crucifix. The Jewish faith is saturated with its remembrance. The equivalence of life and limitation is the primary and unavoidable fact of existence. The vulnerability of our Being renders us susceptible to the pains of social judgement and contempt and the inevitable breakdown of our bodies. But even all those ways of suffering, terrible as they are, are not sufficient to corrupt the world, to transform it into Hell, the way the Nazis and the Maoists and the Stalinists corrupted the world and turned it into Hell.

You must discipline yourself carefully. You must keep the promises you make to yourself, and reward yourself, so that you can trust and motivate yourself. You need to determine how to act toward yourself so that you are most likely to become and to stay a good person.","A house divided against itself, proverbially, cannot stand. Likewise, a poorly integrated person cannot hold himself together when challenged. He loses union at the highest level of psychological organization. He loses the properly balanced admixture of properties that is another feature of the well-tempered soul, and cannot hold his self together. We know this when we say \u201cHe lost it or \u201cHe just fell apart.\u201d Before he picks up the pieces and rearranges them, such a person is likely to fall prey to domination by one or more partial personalities.

I did not know it was the same road at the time, and I am not claiming kinship with Descartes, who is rightly regarded as one of the greatest philosophers of all time. But I was truly plagued with doubt. I had outgrown the shallow Christianity of my youth by the time I could understand the fundamentals of Darwinian theory. After that, I could not distinguish the basic elements of Christian belief from wishful thinking. The socialism that soon afterward became so attractive to me as an alternative proved equally insubstantial; with time, I came to understand, through the great George Orwell, that much of such thinking found its motivation in hatred of the rich and successful, instead of true regard for the poor. Besides, the socialists were more intrinsically capitalist than the capitalists. They believed just as strongly in money. They just thought that if different people had the money, the problems plaguing humanity would vanish. This is simply untrue. There are many problems that money does not solve, and others that it makes worse. Rich people still divorce each other, and alienate themselves from their children, and suffer from existential angst, and develop cancer and dementia, and die alone and unloved. Recovering addicts cursed with money blow it all in a frenzy of snorting and drunkenness. And boredom weighs heavily on people who have nothing to do.","I think often people come to the conclusion that life is meaningless because that\'s a better conclusion to come to than the reverse; because if life is meaningless, well then, who cares what you do? But if life is meaningful - if what you do matters... then everything you do matters. And that puts a terrible responsibility on the individual.

If you aim at nothing, you become plagued by everything. If you aim at nothing, you have nowhere to go, nothing to do, and nothing of high value in your life, as value requires the ranking of options and sacrifice of the lower to the higher.

The same goes for selecting a partner or group of friends.

It\u2019s a very small part of a much greater whole. Most of its capacity resides beyond its hard shell. It maintains its function only because a vast array of other technologies are currently and harmoniously at play. It is fed, for example, by a power grid whose function is invisibly dependent on the stability of a myriad of complex physical, biological, economic and interpersonal systems. The factories that make its parts are still in operation. The operating system that enables its function is based on those parts, and not on others yet to be created. Its video hardware runs the technology expected by the creative people who post their content on the web. Your laptop is in communication with a certain, specified ecosystem of other devices and web servers. And, finally, all this is made possible by an even less visible element: the social contract of trust\u2014the interconnected and fundamentally honest political and economic systems that make the reliable electrical grid a reality. This interdependency of part on whole, invisible in systems that work, becomes starkly evident in systems that don\u2019t. The higher-order, surrounding systems that enable personal computing hardly exist at all in corrupt, third-world countries, so that the power lines, electrical switches, outlets, and all the other entities so hopefully and concretely indicative of such a grid are absent or compromised, and in fact make little contribution to the practical delivery of electricity to people\u2019s homes and factories. This makes perceiving the electronic and other devices that electricity theoretically enables as separate, functional units frustrating, at minimum, and impossible, at worst. This is partly because of technical insufficiency: the systems simply don\u2019t work. But it is also in no small part because of the lack of trust characteristic of systemically corrupt societies. To put it another way: What you perceive as your computer is like a single leaf, on a tree, in a forest\u2014or, even more accurately, like your fingers rubbing briefly across that leaf. A single leaf can be plucked from a branch. It can be perceived, briefly, as a single, self-contained entity\u2014but that perception misleads more than clarifies. In a few weeks, the leaf will crumble and dissolve. It would not have been there at all, without the tree. It cannot continue to exist, in the absence of the tree.

Go to sleep properly, and peaceably, so that your parents can have a private life and not resent your existence. Take care of your belongings, because you need to learn how and because you\u2019re lucky to have them. Be good company when something fun is happening, so that you\u2019re invited for the fun.

The commitments and the sacrifices thereby entailed matured those who endured and made them better people. So, what is the conclusion? There are many things to which we might commit ourselves. A case can be made for the arbitrary and even meaningless nature of any given commitment, given the plethora of alternatives, given the corruption of the systems demanding that commitment. But the same case cannot be made for the fact of commitment itself: Those who do not choose a direction are lost. It is far better to become something than to remain anything but become nothing. This is despite all the genuine limitations and disappointments that becoming something entails. Everywhere, the cynic despairs, are bad decisions. But someone who has transcended that cynicism (or more accurately, replaced it with an even more profound doubt\u2014that is, the doubt that doubt itself is an ultimately reliable guide) objects: the worst decision of all is none.\u201d","If a father disciplines his son properly, he obviously interferes with his freedom, particularly in the here-and-now. He puts limits on the voluntary expression of his son\u2019s Being, forcing him to take his place as a socialized member of the world. Such a father requires that all that childish potential be funneled down a single pathway. In placing such limitations on his son, he might be considered a destructive force, acting as he does to replace the miraculous plurality of childhood with a single narrow actuality. But if the father does not take such action, he merely lets his son remain Peter Pan, the eternal Boy, King of the Lost Boys, Ruler of the non-existent Neverland. That is not a morally acceptable alternative.","Trying to address a perplexing problem: the reason or reasons for the nuclear standoff of the Cold War. I couldn\u2019t understand how belief systems could be so important to people that they were willing to risk the destruction of the world to protect them.","If you decide that you are not justified in your resentment of Being, despite its inequity and pain, you may come to notice things you could fix to reduce even by a bit some unnecessary pain and suffering. You may come to ask yourself, \u201cWhat should I do today? in a manner that means \u201cHow could I use my time to make things better, instead of worse?\u201d Such tasks may announce themselves as the pile of undone paperwork that you could attend to, the room that you could make a bit more welcoming, or the meal that could be a bit more delicious and more gratefully delivered to your family.\u201d","This is because \\"nature\\" is \\"what selects,\\" and the longer a feature has existed the more times it had to be selected - and to shape life. It does not matter whether that feature is physical and biological, or social and cultural. All that matters, foram a Darwinian perspective, is permanence - and the dominance hierarchy, however social or cultural it might appear, has been around for some half a billion years. It\'s permanent. It\'s real. The dominance hierarchy is not capitalism. It\'s not communism, either, for that matter. It\'s not the military-industrial complex. It\'s not the patriarchy - that disposable, malleable, arbitrary cultural artefact. It\'s not even a human creation; not in the most profound sense. It is instead a near-eternal aspect of the environment, and much of that is blamed on these more ephemeral manifestations is a consequence of its unchanging existence.","I believe it was Jung who developed the most surgically wicked of psychoanalytic dicta: if you cannot understand why someone did something, look at the consequences\u2014and infer the motivation.

The people on the floor below were distant and tiny. There was a great expanse between me and any wall\u2014 and even the peak of the dome itself. I have learned to pay attention to dreams, not least because of my training as a clinical psychologist.","In my own periods of darkness, in the underworld of the soul, I find myself frequently overcome and amazed by the ability of people to befriend each other, to love their intimate partners and parents and children, and to do what they must do to keep the machinery of the world running. I knew a man, injured and disabled by a car accident, who was employed by a local utility. For years after the crash he worked side by side with another man, who for his part suffered with a degenerative neurological disease. They cooperated while repairing the lines, each making up for the other\u2019s inadequacy. This sort of everyday heroism is the rule, I believe, rather than the exception. Most individuals are dealing with one or more serious health problems while going productively and uncomplainingly about their business. If anyone is fortunate enough to be in a rare period of grace and health, personally, then he or she typically has at least one close family member in crisis. Yet people prevail and continue to do difficult and effortful tasks to hold themselves and their families and society together. To me this is miraculous\u2014so much so that a dumbfounded gratitude is the only appropriate response. There are so many ways that things can fall apart, or fail to work altogether, and it is always wounded people who are holding it together. They deserve some genuine and heartfelt admiration for that. It\u2019s an ongoing miracle of fortitude and perseverance","It is to women\u2019s clear advantage that men do not happily put up with dependency among themselves. Part of the reason that so many a working-class woman does not marry, now, as we have alluded to, is because she does not want to look after a man, struggling for employment, as well as her children. And fair enough.","those who avoid their destiny by standing back when asked to step forward also deprive everyone else of the advantages that may have come their way had the person who took the easy way instead determined to be all they could be.","They can\u2019t do it without wandering down blind alleys or making contradictory or even nonsensical claims.

The child\u2014the successful child\u2014can leave his parents, at least temporarily, and make friends. He gives up a little of himself to do that, but gains much in return. The successful adolescent must take that process to its logical conclusion. He has to leave his parents and become like everyone else. He has to integrate with the group so he can transcend his childhood dependency. Once integrated, the successful adult then must learn how to be just the right amount different from everyone else.","We have committed an error, or a series of errors. We have spent too much time, for example (much of the last fifty years), clamoring about rights, and we are no longer asking enough of the young people we are socializing. We have been telling them for decades to demand what they are owed by society. We have been implying that the important meanings of their lives will be given to them because of such demands, when we should have been doing the opposite: letting them know that the meaning that sustains life in all its tragedy and disappointment is to be found in shouldering a noble burden","After all, if you\u2019re not the leading man in your own drama, you\u2019re a bit player in someone else\u2019s\u2014and you might well be assigned to play a dismal, lonely and tragic part","My dream placed me at the centre of Being itself, and there was no escape.

Nonetheless, there are times when its application proves enlightening.","And a man should look after a woman and children\u2014although that is not all he should do. But a woman should not look after a man, because she must look after children, and a man should not be a child. This means that he must not be dependent. This is one of the reasons that men have little patience for dependent men. And let us not forget: wicked women may produce dependent sons, may support and even marry dependent men,","Memory is not a description of the objective past. Memory is a tool.

The proper response to that statement is not, \\"well, then, everything is meaningless\\". It\'s \\"any idiot can choose a frame of time within which nothing matters\\".

Nietzsche did not make this claim in a narcissistic or triumphant manner. The great thinker\u2019s opinion stemmed from his fear that all the Judeo-Christian values serving as the foundation of Western civilization had been made dangerously subject to casual rational criticism, and that the most important axiom upon which they were predicated\u2014the existence of a transcendent, all-powerful deity\u2014had been fatally challenged.

It becomes his God, for all intents and purposes. It constitutes his highest value. It regulates his emotions and motivational states, and determines his thoughts. All people serve their ambition.

Very few people set out, consciously, to do a terrible job as father or mother, but bad parenting happens all the time. This is because people have a great capacity for evil, as well as good\u2014and because they remain willfully blind to that fact. People are aggressive and selfish, as well as kind and thoughtful. For this reason, no adult human being\u2014no hierarchical, predatory ape\u2014can truly tolerate being dominated by an upstart child. Revenge will come. Ten minutes after a pair of all-too-nice-and-patient parents have failed to prevent a public tantrum at the local supermarket, they will pay their toddler back with the cold shoulder when he runs up, excited, to show mom and dad his newest accomplishment. Enough embarrassment, disobedience, and dominance challenge, and even the most hypothetically selfless parent will become resentful. And then the real punishment will begin. Resentment breeds the desire for vengeance. Fewer spontaneous offers of love will be offered, with more rationalizations for their absence. Fewer opportunities for the personal development of the child will be sought out. A subtle turning away will begin. And this is only the beginning of the road to total familial warfare, conducted mostly in the underworld, underneath the false fa\xe7ade of normality and love.","I couldn\u2019t understand how belief systems could be so important to people that they were willing to risk the destruction of the world to protect them.","\xab\xbfHa ocurrido lo que quer\xeda?

People with agoraphobia can become so overwhelmed with fear that they will no longer leave their homes. Agoraphobia is the consequence of a positive feedback loop. The first event that precipitates the disorder is often a panic attack. The sufferer is typically a middle-aged woman who has been too dependent on other people. Perhaps she went immediately from over-reliance on her father to a relationship with an older and comparatively dominant boyfriend or husband, with little or no break for independent existence. In the weeks leading up to the emergence of her agoraphobia, such a woman typically experiences something unexpected and anomalous.","If and when the gods come to an agreement about their relative positions\u2014more particularly, if they arrange themselves into a hierarchy\u2014it means that peace has genuinely been established, because peace is the establishment of a shared hierarchy of divinity, of value.

Here are some suggestions. Do not bite, kick or hit, except in self-defence. Do not torture and bully other children, so you don\u2019t end up in jail. Eat in a civilized and thankful manner, so that people are happy to have you at their house, and pleased to feed you. Learn to share, so other kids will play with you. Pay attention when spoken to by adults, so they don\u2019t hate you and might therefore deign to teach you something. Go to sleep properly, and peaceably, so that your parents can have a private life and not resent your existence. Take care of your belongings, because you need to learn how and because you\u2019re lucky to have them. Be good company when something fun is happening, so that you\u2019re invited for the fun.

A parent who is seriously aware of his or her limited tolerance and capacity for misbehaviour when provoked can therefore seriously plan a proper disciplinary strategy\u2014particularly if monitored by an equally awake partner\u2014and never let things degenerate to the point where genuine hatred emerges. Beware. There are toxic families everywhere. They make no rules and limit no misbehaviour. The parents lash out randomly and unpredictably.

They tend to treat those around them as if they were distressed children. They tend to be na\xefve. They assume that cooperation should be the basis of all social transactions, and they avoid conflict (which means they avoid confronting problems in their relationships as well as at work). They continually sacrifice for others. This may sound virtuous\u2014and it is definitely an attitude that has certain social advantages\u2014but it can and often does become counterproductively one-sided. Because too-agreeable people bend over backwards for other people, they do not stand up properly for themselves. Assuming that others think as they do, they expect\u2014instead of ensuring\u2014reciprocity for their thoughtful actions. When this does not happen, they don\u2019t speak up. They do not or cannot straightforwardly demand recognition. The dark side of their characters emerges, because of their subjugation, and they become resentful.\u201d","Pointing is, as well, a crucial precursor to the development of language.

Parents have a duty to act as proxies for the real world\u2014merciful proxies, caring proxies\u2014but proxies, nonetheless. This obligation supersedes any responsibility to ensure happiness, foster creativity, or boost self-esteem. It is the primary duty of parents to make their children socially desirable.

The danger associated with this can be amplified by high trait neuroticism. Agreeable people will go along with whoever makes a suggestion, instead of insisting, at least sometimes, on their own way. So, they lose their way, and become indecisive and too easily swayed. If they are, in addition, easily frightened and hurt, they have even less reason to strike out on their own, as doing so exposes them to threat and danger (at least in the short term). That\u2019s the pathway to dependent personality disorder, technically speaking.198 It might be regarded as the polar opposite of antisocial personality disorder, the set of traits characteristic of delinquency in childhood and adolescence and criminality in adulthood. It would be lovely if the opposite of a criminal was a saint\u2014but it\u2019s not the case. The opposite of a criminal is an Oedipal mother, which is its own type of criminal.","What shall I say to a faithless brother. The king of the damned is a poor judge of being.

Learn to share, so other kids will play with you. Pay attention when spoken to by adults, so they don\u2019t hate you and might therefore deign to teach you something. Go to sleep properly, and peaceably, so that your parents can have a private life and not resent your existence. Take care of your belongings, because you need to learn how and because you\u2019re lucky to have them. Be good company when something fun is happening, so that you\u2019re invited for the fun.

All of that misfortune is only the bitter half of the tale of existence, without taking note of the heroic element of redemption or the nobility of the human spirit requiring a certain responsibility to shoulder. We ignore that addition to the story at our peril, because life is so difficult that losing sight of the heroic part of existence could cost us everything. We do not want that to happen. We need instead to take heart, and to take spirit, and to look at things carefully and properly, and to live the way that we could live. You have sources of strength upon which you can draw, and even though they may not work well, they may be enough. You have what you can learn if you can accept your error. You have medications and hospitals, as well as physicians and nurses who genuinely and bravely care to lift you up and help you through every day. And then you have your own character and courage, and if those have been beat to a bloody pulp and you are ready to throw in the towel, you have the character and courage of those for whom you care and who care for you.

When the ancient Greeks sailed to India and elsewhere, they too discovered that rules, morals and customs differed from place to place, and saw that the explanation for what was right and wrong was often rooted in some ancestral authority. The Greek response was not despair, but a new invention: philosophy. Socrates, reacting to the uncertainty bred by awareness of these conflicting moral codes, decided that instead of becoming a nihilist, a relativist or an ideologue, he would devote his life to the search for wisdom that could reason about these differences, i.e., he helped invent philosophy. He spent his life asking perplexing, foundational questions, such as \u201cWhat is virtue? and \u201cHow can one live the good life?\u201d and \u201cWhat is justice?\u201d and he looked at different approaches, asking which seemed most coherent and most in accord with human nature.

For the ancients, the discovery that different people have different ideas about how, practically, to live, did not paralyze them; it deepened their understanding of humanity and led to some of the most satisfying conversations human beings have ever had, about how life might be lived.\u201d","With their capacity for aggression strait-jacketed within a too-narrow morality, those who are only or merely compassionate and self-sacrificing (and na\xefve and exploitable) cannot call forth the genuinely righteous and appropriately self-protective anger necessary to defend themselves.","Sanity is knowing the rules of the social game, internalizing them, and following them.","Lo tienes que saber porque no es posible arreglar algo antes de saber que est\xe1 roto.","The queen of the underworld, the goddess of chaos, is also the force that eternally renews.","Your current knowledge has neither made you perfect nor kept you safe. So, it is insufficient, by definition--radically, fatally insufficient.","A cegueira volunt\xe1ria \xe9 a recusa em saber algo que pode ser conhecido. \xc9 a recusa em admitir que aquele som \xe9 algu\xe9m a bater \xe0 porta. \xc9 a recusa em ver o enorme gorila na sala, o elefante debaixo do tapete, o esqueleto no arm\xe1rio. \xc9 a recusa em admitir erros enquanto seguimos com o plano.","The worst of all possible snakes is the eternal human proclivity for evil. The worst of all possible snakes is psychological, spiritual, personal, internal. No walls, however tall, will keep that out. Even if the fortress were thick enough, in principle, to keep everything bad whatsoever outside, it would immediately appear again within.","Courageous and truthful words will render your reality simple, pristine, well-defined and habitable.","Perhaps communism may even have been a viable solution to the problems of the unequal distribution of wealth that characterized the industrial age, if all of the hypothetically oppressed were good people and all of the evil was to be found, as hypothesized, in their bourgeoisie overlords. Unfortunately for the communists, a substantial proportion of the oppressed were incapable, unconscientious, unintelligent, licentious, power mad, violent, resentful, and jealous, while a substantial proportion of the oppressors were educated, able, creative, intelligent, honest, and caring. When the frenzy of dekulakization swept through the newly established Soviet Union, it was vengeful and jealous murderers who were redistributing property, while it was competent and reliable farmers, for the most part, from whom it was violently taken. One unintended consequence of that \u201credistribution of good fortune was the starvation of six million Ukrainians in the 1930s, in the midst of some of the most fertile land in the world.\u201d","Un fatto \xe8 qualcosa di morto, in s\xe9 e per s\xe9.

Everywhere\xa0.\xa0.\xa0. if you are fortunate and awake.","But not everyone who is failing is a victim, and not everyone at the bottom wishes to rise, although many do, and many manage it. Nonetheless, people will often accept or even amplify their own suffering, as well as that of others, if they can brandish it as evidence of the world\u2019s injustice. There is no shortage of oppressors among the downtrodden, even if, given their lowly positions, many of them are only tyrannical wannabes. It\u2019s the easiest path to choose, moment to moment, although it\u2019s nothing but hell in the long run.","Do not pretend you are happy with something if you are not, and if a reasonable solution might, in principle, be negotiated. Have the damn fight. Unpleasant as that might be in the moment, it is one less straw on the camel\u2019s back.","Do not bit, kick or hit, except in self-defence. Do not torture and bully other children, so you don\'t end up in jail. Eat in a civilized and thankful manner, so that people are happy to have you at their house, and pleased to feed you. Learn to share, so other kids will play with you. Pay attention when spoken to by adults, so they don\'t hate you and might therefore deign to teach you something. Go to sleep properly, and peaceably, so that your parents can have a private life and not resent your existence. Take care of your belongings, because you need to learn how and because you\'re lucky to have them. Be good company when something fun is happening, so that you\'re invited for the fun. Act so that other people are happy you\'re around, so that people will want you around. A child who knows these rules will be welcome anywhere.","Your nervous system responds in an entirely different manner when you face the demands of life voluntarily.","elige, a la hora de conocer a gente, exactamente al mismo tipo de individuos que en el pasado le resultaron problem\xe1ticos.

That is neither an arbitrary moral opinion nor a morally relative claim. It is something more akin to knowledge of twin natural laws built into the structure of our reality. Highly social creatures such as we are must abide by the rules, to remain sane and minimize unnecessary uncertainty, suffering, and strife. However, we must also transform those rules carefully, as circumstances change around us.","The same thing happens when well-meaning counsellors place a delinquent teen among comparatively civilized peers. The delinquency spreads, not the stability.65 Down is a lot easier than up.","Life is what repeats, and it is worth getting what repeats right.","Psychologically speaking, Christ is a representation, or an embodiment, of the mastery of dogma and the (consequent) emergence of spirit. Spirit is the creative force that gives rise to what becomes dogma, with time. Spirit is also that which constantly transcends such time-honored tradition, when possible. It is for this reason that an apprenticeship ends with a masterpiece, the creation of which signifies not only the acquisition of the requisite skill, but the acquisition of the ability to create new skills.","Proper discipline requires effort -- indeed, is virtually synonymous with effort.

The answer to that, as far as I can tell, is by communicating through stories about what is and, equally, what could be. And what that implies is that if possibility is the ultimate element of reality with which we contend, then it is stories that hold the wisdom that we most need to know.","Mantenerse erguido con los hombros hacia atr\xe1s es aceptar con los ojos bien abiertos la terrible responsabilidad que supone vivir.","We are not equal in ability or outcome, and never will be.

It brought joy to everyone at the table. Twenty years later, writing it down today, it still brings me to tears. Afterward, he followed my wife around like a puppy for the rest of the day, refusing to let her out of his sight. When she sat down, he jumped in her lap, cuddling in, opening himself back up to the world, searching desperately for the love he had been continually denied. Later in the day, but far too soon, his mother reappeared. She came down the stairs into the room we all occupied. \u201cOh, SuperMom,\u201d she uttered, resentfully, seeing her son curled up in my wife\u2019s lap. Then she departed, black, murderous heart unchanged, doomed child in hand. She was a psychologist. The things you can see, with even a single open eye.

If you ever wonder how perfectly ordinary, decent people could find themselves doing the terrible things the gulag camp guards did, you now have your answer. By the time no seriously needed to be said, there was no one left capable of saying it. If you betray yourself, if you say untrue things, if you act out a lie, you weaken your character. If you have a weak character, then adversity will mow you down when it appears, as it will, inevitably. You will hide, but there will be no place left to hide. And then you will find yourself doing terrible things.","Say what you mean, so that you can find out what you mean. Act out what you say, so you can find out what happens. Then pay attention. Note your errors.","It is difficult to win an argument, or even begin one, if you have not carefully articulated what you want (or do not) and need (or do not).","A creature that cannot think must solely embody its Being. It can merely act out its nature, concretely, in the here-and-now. If it cannot manifest in its behavior what the environment demands while doing so, it will simply die.

What does that ability indicate, after all, about the true depths of your love? If you can witness their demise and survive the loss, does that not imply that the bond was shallow and temporary, and even replaceable?

It is of vital importance to reiterate, in light of this victory, the fact that he enters the battle voluntarily. It is a maxim of clinical intervention\u2014a consequence of observation of improvement in mental health across many schools of practical psychological thought\u2014that voluntary confrontation with a feared, hated, or despised obstacle is curative.","When this does not happen, they don\u2019t speak up.

This is yet another variant of the dominance-hierarchy conversation. During such a conversation, which often tends toward the ideological, the speaker endeavours to (1) denigrate or ridicule the viewpoint of anyone holding a contrary position, (2) use selective evidence while doing so and, finally, (3) impress the listeners (many of whom are already occupying the same ideological space) with the validity of his assertions. The goal is to gain support for a comprehensive, unitary, oversimplified world-view. Thus, the purpose of the conversation is to make the case that not thinking is the correct tack. The person who is speaking in this manner believes that winning the argument makes him right, and that doing so necessarily validates the assumption-structure of the dominance hierarchy he most identifies with. This is often\u2014and unsurprisingly\u2014the hierarchy within which he has achieved the most success, or the one with which he is most temperamentally aligned. Almost all discussions involving politics or economics unfold in this manner, with each participant attempting to justify fixed, a priori positions instead of trying to learn something or to adopt a different frame (even for the novelty). It is for this reason that conservatives and liberals alike believe their positions to be self-evident, particularly as they become more extreme. Given certain temperamentally-based assumptions, a predictable conclusion emerges\u2014but only when you ignore the fact that the assumptions themselves are mutable.","Then he asked himself the most difficult of questions: had he personally contributed to the catastrophe of his life?

Michelangelo\u2019s great perfect marble David cries out to its observer: \u201cYou could be more than you are. When you dare aspire upward, you reveal the inadequacy of the present and the promise of the future. Then you disturb others, in the depths of their souls, where they understand that their cynicism and immobility are unjustifiable. You play Abel to their Cain. You remind them that they ceased caring not because of life\u2019s horrors, which are undeniable, but because they do not want to lift the world up on to their shoulders, where it belongs. Don\u2019t think that it is easier to surround yourself with good healthy people than with bad unhealthy people. It\u2019s not. A good, healthy person is an ideal. It requires strength and daring to stand up near such a person. Have some humility. Have some courage. Use your judgment, and protect yourself from too-uncritical compassion and pity. Make friends with people who want the best for you.\u201d","Making something beautiful is difficult, but it is amazingly worthwhile. If you learn to make something in your life truly beautiful\u2014even one thing\u2014then you have established a relationship with beauty. From there you can begin to expand that relationship out into other elements of your life and the world. That is an invitation to the divine. That is the reconnection with the immortality of childhood, and the true beauty and majesty of the Being you can no longer see. You must be daring to try that.","A hurricane is an act of God. But failure to prepare, when the necessity for preparation is well known\u2014that\u2019s sin. That\u2019s failure to hit the mark. And the wages of sin is death (Romans 6:23). The ancient Jews always blamed themselves when things fell apart. They acted as if God\u2019s goodness\u2014the goodness of reality\u2014was axiomatic, and took responsibility for their own failure. That\u2019s insanely responsible. But the alternative is to judge reality as insufficient, to criticize Being itself, and to sink into resentment and the desire for revenge.","What reality is is an emergent consequence of the interaction between something that is painfully limited-- like us-- and whatever the absolute is, which is something that is completely without borders.","If existence is good, then the clearest and cleanest and most correct relationship with it is also good. If existence is not good, by contrast, you\u2019re lost.

In that extreme case, the too-cautious, too-caring parent merely substitutes him or herself for the other terrible problems of life. This is the great Freudian Oedipal nightmare.49 It is far better to render Beings in your care competent than to protect them.","You answer because some hyper-ambitious legal associate in New York would be happy to answer, if you don\u2019t\u2014and that\u2019s why the market defines the work.","noted, \u201cHe whose life has a why can bear almost any how.61\u201d","No one likes to be pushed around, but people often put up with it for too long. So, I get them to see their resentment, first, as anger, and then as an indication that something needs to be said, if not done (not least because honesty demands it). Then I get them to see such action as part of the force that holds tyranny at bay\u2014at the social level, as much as the individual.","Only careful aim and wakeful striving and commitment can eliminate the oft-incremental calamity of willful blindness, stem the entropic tide, and keep catastrophe\u2014familial and social alike\u2014at bay.","Was it really a good thing, for example, to so dramatically liberalize the divorce laws in the 1960s? It\u2019s not clear to me that the children whose lives were destabilized by the hypothetical freedom this attempt at liberation introduced would say so. Horror and terror lurk behind the walls provided so wisely by our ancestors. We tear them down at our peril. We skate, unconsciously, on thin ice, with deep, cold waters below, where unimaginable monsters lurk.","Attend to the day, but aim at the highest good.","The person speaking is granted the opportunity to seriously discuss some event, usually unhappy or even tragic. Everyone else responds sympathetically. These conversations are important because the speaker is organizing the troublesome event in his or her mind, while recounting the story. The fact is important enough to bear repeating: people organize their brains with conversation. If they don\u2019t have anyone to tell their story to, they lose their minds. Like hoarders, they cannot unclutter themselves. The input of the community is required for the integrity of the individual psyche. To put it another way: It takes a village to organize a mind.","The rot must be revealed before something sound can be put in its place,","The people from whom you want thanks might not be very proficient in offering it, to begin with, but that shouldn\u2019t stop you.","We are not happy, technically speaking, unless we see ourselves progressing\u2014and the very idea of progression implies value. Worse yet is the fact that the meaning of life without positive value is not simply neutral. Because we are vulnerable and mortal, pain and anxiety are an integral part of human existence. We must have something to set against the suffering that is intrinsic to Being.*2 We must have the meaning inherent in a profound system of value or the horror of existence rapidly becomes paramount. Then, nihilism beckons, with its hopelessness and despair.","As pessoas que acompanham uma hist\xf3ria est\xe3o dispostas a suspender a descren\xe7a, desde que as limita\xe7\xf5es que tornam a hist\xf3ria poss\xedvel sejam coerentes e consistentes.

What is going to save you? The totalitarian says, in essence, \u201cYou must rely on faith in what you already know. But that is not what saves. What saves is the willingness to learn from what you don\u2019t know. That is faith in the possibility of human transformation. That is faith in the sacrifice of the current self for the self that could be.\u201d","So, attend carefully to your posture. Quit drooping and hunching around. Speak your mind. Put your desires forward, as if you had a right to them \u2013 at least the same right as others. Walk tall and gaze forthrightly ahead. Dare to be dangerous. Encourage the serotonin to flow plentifully through\xa0the neural pathways desperate for its calming influence.\xa0People, including yourself, will start to assume that you are competent and able (or at least they will not immediately conclude the reverse).Doing so, will not genuinely increase the probability that good things will happen to you \u2013 it will also make those good things feel better they do happen.","the 1960s, a decade whose excesses led to a general denigration of adulthood, an unthinking disbelief in the existence of competent power, and the inability to distinguish between the chaos of immaturity and responsible freedom.","Loss of group-centred belief renders life chaotic, miserable, intolerable; presence of group-centred belief makes conflict with other groups inevitable.","We are well advised to take on challenges at precisely the rate that engages and compels alertness, and forces the development of courage, skill, and talent, and to avoid foolhardy confrontation with that which lies beyond current comprehension.","If you study art (and literature and the humanities), you do it so that you can familiarize yourself with the collected wisdom of our civilization. This is a very good idea\u2014a veritable necessity\u2014because people have been working out how to live for a long time. What they have produced is strange but also rich beyond comparison, so why not use it as a guide?","An idea has an aim. It wants something. It posits a value structure. An idea believes that what it is aiming for is better than what it has now. It reduces the world to those things that aid or impede its realization, and it reduces everything else to irrelevance. An idea defines figure against ground. An idea is a personality, not a fact. When it manifests itself within a person, it has a strong proclivity to make of that person its avatar: to impel that person to act it out. Sometimes, that impulsion (possession is another word) can be so strong that the person will die, rather than allowing the idea to perish. This is, generally speaking, a bad decision, given that it is often the case that only the idea need die, and that the person with the idea can stop being its avatar, change his or her ways, and continue.","Ask, and ye shall receive. Knock, and the door will open. If you ask, as if you want, and knock, as if you want to enter, you may be offered the chance to improve your life, a little; a lot; completely\u2014and with that improvement, some progress will be made in Being itself. Compare yourself to who you were yesterday, not to who someone else is today.","Start to stop doing what you know to be wrong. Start stopping today. Don\u2019t waste time questioning how you know that what you\u2019re doing is wrong, if you are certain that it is. Inopportune questioning can confuse, without enlightening, as well as deflecting you from action. You can know that something is wrong or right without knowing why. Your entire Being can tell you something that you can neither explain nor articulate. Every person is too complex to know themselves completely, and we all contain wisdom that we cannot comprehend. So, simply stop, when you apprehend, however dimly, that you should stop. Stop acting in that particular, despicable manner. Stop saying those things that make you weak and ashamed. Say only those things that make you strong. Do only those things that you could speak of with honour.","There is no enlightened one. There is only the one who is seeking further enlightenment.","Not everyone who is failing is a victim, and not everyone who is at the bottom wishes to rise.","Freud believed that much of mental illness was due to repression, which is arguably and reasonably considered a form of self-deception. For him, memories of traumatically troubling events were unconsciously banished to perdition in the unconscious, where they rattled around and caused trouble, like poltergeists in a dungeon.","What we inherit from the past is willfully blind, and out of date. It\u2019s a ghost, a machine, and a monster. It must be rescued, repaired and kept at bay by the attention and effort of the living. It crushes, as it hammers us into socially acceptable shape, and it wastes great potential. But it offers great gain, too. Every word we speak is a gift from our ancestors. Every thought we think was thought previously by someone smarter. The highly functional infrastructure that surrounds us, particularly in the West, is a gift from our ancestors: the comparatively uncorrupt political and economic systems, the technology, the wealth, the lifespan, the freedom, the luxury, and the opportunity. Culture takes with one hand, but in some fortunate places it gives more with the other. To think about culture only as oppressive is ignorant and ungrateful, as well as dangerous. This is not to say (as I am hoping the content of this book has made abundantly clear, so far) that culture should not be subject to criticism.","It\u2019s a good idea to tell the person you are confronting exactly what you would like them to do instead of what they have done or currently are doing.","Restraining orders work best, however, with the sort of person who would never require a restraining order.","The future: that\u2019s where you go to die","Perhaps you will then see that if all people did this, in their own lives, the world might stop being an evil place. After that, with continued effort, perhaps it could even stop being a tragic place. Who knows what existence might be like if we all decided to strive for the best? Who knows what eternal heavens might be established by our spirits, purified by truth, aiming skyward, right here on the fallen Earth? Set your house in perfect order before you criticize the world.","Not long after came the publication of Aleksandr Solzhenitsyn\u2019s The Gulag Archipelago, which we have discussed rather extensively in previous chapters. As noted (and is worth noting again), this book utterly demolished communism\u2019s moral credibility\u2014first in the West, and then in the Soviet System itself. It circulated in underground samizdat format. Russians had twenty-four hours to read their rare copy before handing it to the next waiting mind. A Russian-language reading was broadcast into the Soviet Union by Radio Liberty.","The third form of arrogance that underlies deceit has to do with the belief that the deceitful act (which, as we already discussed, has bent or warped the structure of reality) will stand on its own powerfully, without being revealed and destroyed as reality itself straightens and reforms, as it inevitably will. That is the arrogance behind the liar\u2019s belief that the lie has somehow permanently altered the form of the world, so that now life in the world can be conducted as if that lie is somehow real.","Did what I want happen? No. Then the world is unfair. People are jealous, and too stupid to understand. It is the fault of something or someone else. That is the voice of inauthenticity. It is not too far from there to \u201cthey should be stopped\u201d or \u201cthey must be hurt\u201d or \u201cthey must be destroyed.\u201d Whenever you hear about something incomprehensibly brutal, such ideas have manifested themselves.\u201d","What shall I do when I despise what I have? Remember those who have nothing and strive to be grateful.","Pain matters, more than matter matters.","Freud understood that the human personality was not unitary. Instead, it consists of a loose, fragmented cacophony of spirits, who do not always agree or even communicate.","Agreeable people will go along with whoever makes a suggestion, instead of insisting, at least sometimes, on their own way.","When the denizens of those ancient societies wandered carelessly down the wrong path, they ended up enslaved and miserable\u2014sometimes for centuries\u2014when they were not obliterated completely","Milton believed that stubborn refusal to change in the face of error not only meant ejection from heaven, and subsequent degeneration into an ever-deepening hell, but the rejection of redemption itself. Satan knows full well that even if he was willing to seek reconciliation, and God willing to grant it, he would only rebel again, because he will not change.","But \u201cfeeling of a conqueror can all too easily become \u201cactual conqueror.\u201d","It is deceit that makes people miserable beyond what they can bear. It is deceit that fills human souls with resentment and vengefulness. It is deceit that produces the terrible suffering of mankind: the death camps of the Nazis; the torture chambers and genocides of Stalin and that even greater monster, Mao. It was deceit that killed hundreds of millions of people in the twentieth century. It was deceit that almost doomed civilization itself. It is deceit that still threatens us, most profoundly, today.","People who refuse to muster appropriately self-protective territorial responses are laid open to exploitation as much as those who genuinely can\u2019t stand up for their own rights because of a more essential inability or a true imbalance in power.","Typical calculated ends might include \u201cto impose my ideological beliefs, \u201cto prove that I am (or was) right,\u201d \u201cto appear competent,\u201d \u201cto ratchet myself up the dominance hierarchy,\u201d \u201cto avoid responsibility\u201d (or its twin, \u201cto garner credit for others\u2019 actions\u201d), \u201cto be promoted,\u201d \u201cto attract the lion\u2019s share of attention,\u201d \u201cto ensure that everyone likes me,\u201d \u201cto garner the benefits of martyrdom,\u201d \u201cto justify my cynicism,\u201d \u201cto rationalize my antisocial outlook,\u201d \u201cto minimize immediate conflict,\u201d \u201cto maintain my na\xefvet\xe9,\u201d \u201cto capitalize on my vulnerability,\u201d \u201cto always appear as the sainted one,\u201d or (this one is particularly evil) \u201cto ensure that it is always my unloved child\u2019s fault.\u201d These are all examples of what Sigmund Freud\u2019s compatriot, the lesser-known Austrian psychologist Alfred Adler, called \u201clife-lies.\u201d","When we first began to perceive the unknown, chaotic, non-animal world, we used categories that had originally evolved to represent the pre-human animal social world. Our minds are far older than mere humanity.","Svaka ku\u0107a od medenjaka unutra krije vje\u0161ticu koja jede djecu.","How do you know that your attempts to pull someone up won\u2019t instead bring them\u2014or you\u2014further down?","I believe that the good that people do, small though it may appear, has more to do with the good that manifests broadly in the world than people think, and I believe the same about evil. We are each more responsible for the state of the world than we believe, or would feel comfortable believing.","Maybe I can then conclude, about myself, \u201cSomeone that self-sacrificing, that willing to help someone\u2014that has to be a good person. Not so. It might be just a person trying to look good pretending to solve what appears to be a difficult problem instead of actually being good and addressing something real.\u201d","\xbfPor que estas tan seguro de que no quieres llevar algo pesado a cuestas?

This is partly because all the things we have come to know were born, originally, of the unknown, just as all beings we encounter were born of mothers. Chaos is mater, origin, source, mother; materia, the substance from which all things are made. It is also what matters, or what is the matter\u2014the very subject matter of thought and communication. In its positive guise, chaos is possibility itself, the source of ideas, the mysterious realm of gestation and birth.","Reality itself is whatever we contend with when we are striving to survive and reproduce. A lot of that is other beings, their opinions of us, and their communities. And that\u2019s that.","The personalities we have evolved to perceive have been around, in predictable form, and in typical, hierarchical configurations, forever, for all intents and purposes. They have been male or female, for example, for a billion years. That\u2019s a long time. The division of life into its twin sexes occurred before the evolution of multi-cellular animals. It was in a still-respectable one-fifth of that time that mammals, who take extensive care of their young, emerged. Thus, the category of \u201cparent and/or \u201cchild\u201d has been around for 200 million years. That\u2019s longer than birds have existed. That\u2019s longer than flowers have grown. It\u2019s not a billion years, but it\u2019s still a very long time. It\u2019s plenty long enough for male and female and parent and child to serve as vital and fundamental parts of the environment to which we have adapted. This means that male and female and parent and child are categories, for us\u2014natural categories, deeply embedded in our perceptual, emotional and motivational structures.\u201d","People create their worlds with the tools they have directly at hand. Faulty tools produce faulty results. Repeated use of the same faulty tools produces the same faulty results. It is in this manner that those who fail to learn from the past doom themselves to repeat it. It\u2019s partly fate. It\u2019s partly inability. It\u2019s partly\u2026unwillingness to learn? Refusal to learn? Motivated refusal to learn?","In other words, you decide to act as if existence might be justified by its goodness\u2014if only you behaved properly. And it is that decision, that declaration of existential faith, that allows you to overcome nihilism, and resentment, and arrogance.","He who has many material things, may be described as rich, but he who knows he has enough, and is at one with the Tao,","Before Set\u2019s defeat and banishment from the kingdom, he tears out one of his nephew\u2019s eyes. But the eventually victorious Horus takes back the eye. Then he does something truly unexpected: he journeys voluntarily to the underworld and gives the eye to his father. What does this mean? First, that the encounter with malevolence and evil is of sufficient terror to damage even the vision of a god; second, that the attentive son can restore the vision of his father.","C\xe9lozz meg valamit.

Should victory in the present always take precedence over trajectory across time?","The socialism that soon afterward became so attractive to me as an alternative proved equally insubstantial; with time, I came to understand, through the great George Orwell, that much of such thinking found its motivation in hatred of the rich and successful, instead of true regard for the poor.","We must have the meaning inherent in a profound system of value or the horror of existence rapidly becomes paramount.

The act of seeing is particularly important when it challenges what we know and rely on, upsetting and destabilizing us. It is the act of seeing that informs the individual and updates the state.

That single sentence, wise beyond comprehension, sums up Christianity. Every bit of learning is a little death.

The better ambitions have to do with the development of character and ability, rather than status and power. Status you can lose. You carry character with you wherever you go, and it allows you to prevail against adversity. Knowing this, tie a rope to a boulder. Pick up the great stone, heave it in front of you, and pull yourself towards it. Watch and observe while you move forward. Articulate your experience as clearly and carefully to yourself and others as you possibly can. In this manner, you will learn to proceed more effectively and efficiently towards your goal.

Become aware of your own insufficiency\u2014your cowardice, malevolence, resentment and hatred. Consider the murderousness of your own spirit before you dare accuse others, and before you attempt to repair the fabric of the world. Maybe it\u2019s not the world that\u2019s at fault. Maybe it\u2019s you. You\u2019ve failed to make the mark. You\u2019ve missed the target. You\u2019ve fallen short of the glory of God. You\u2019ve sinned.

An aim reduces anxiety, because if you have no aim everything can mean anything or nothing, and neither of those two options makes for a tranquil spirit.","If you listen, instead, without premature judgment, people will generally tell you everything they are thinking\u2014and with very little deceit. People will tell you the most amazing, absurd, interesting things. Very few of your conversations will be boring. (You can in fact tell whether or not you are actually listening in this manner. If the conversation is boring, you probably aren\u2019t.)","You already know what you know, after all\u2014and, unless your life is perfect, what you know is not enough. You remain threatened by disease, and self-deception, and unhappiness, and malevolence, and betrayal, and corruption, and pain, and limitation. You are subject to all these things, in the final analysis, because you are just too ignorant to protect yourself. If you just knew enough, you could be healthier and more honest. You would suffer less. You could recognize, resist and even triumph over malevolence and evil. You would neither betray a friend, nor deal falsely and deceitfully in business, politics or love. However, your current knowledge has neither made you perfect nor kept you safe. So, it is insufficient, by definition\u2014radically, fatally insufficient.You must accept this before you can converse philosophically, instead of convincing, oppressing, dominating or even amusing. You must accept this before you can tolerate a conversation where the Word that eternally mediates between order and chaos is operating, psychologically speaking. To have this kind of conversation, it is necessary to respect the personal experience of your conversational partners. You must assume that they have reached careful, thoughtful, genuine conclusions (and, perhaps, they must have done the work thajustifies this assumption). You must believe that if they shared their conclusions with you, you could bypass at least some of the pain of personally learning the same things (as learning from the experience of others can be quicker and much less dangerous). You must meditate, too, instead of strategizing towards victory. If you fail, or refuse, to do so, then you merely and automatically repeat what you already believe, seeking its validation and insisting on its rightness. But if you are meditating as you converse, then you listen to the other person, and say the new and original things that can rise from deep within of their own accord.It\u2019s as if you are listening to yourself during such a conversation, just as you are listening to the other person. You are describing how you are responding to the new information imparted by the speaker. You are reporting what that information has done to you\u2014what new things it made appear within you, how it has changed your presuppositions, how it has made you think of new questions. You tell the speaker these things, directly. Then they have the same effect on him. In this manner, you both move towards somewhere newer and broader and better. You both change, as you let your old presuppositions die\u2014as you shed your skins and emerge renewed.A conversation such as this is one where it is the desire for truth itself\u2014on the part of both participants\u2014that is truly listening and speaking. That\u2019s why it\u2019s engaging, vital, interesting and meaningful. That sense of meaning is a signal from the deep, ancient parts of your Being. You\u2019re where you should be, with one foot in order, and the other tentatively extended into chaos and the unknown. You\u2019re immersed in the Tao, following the great Way of Life. There, you\u2019re stable enough to be secure, but flexible enough to transform.There, you\u2019re allowing new information to inform you\u2014to permeate your stability, to repair and improve its structure, and expand its domain. There the constituent elements of your Being can find their more elegant formation. A conversation like that places you in the same place that listening to great music places you, and for much the same reason. A conversation like that puts you in the realm where souls connect, and that\u2019s a real place. It leaves you thinking, \u201cThat was really worthwhile. We really got to know each other. The masks came off, and the searchers were revealed.So, listen, to yourself and to those with whom you are speaking. Your wisdom then consists not of the knowledge you already have, but the continual search for knowledge, which is the highest form of wisdom.\u201d","Un viejo perro manso puede morder, las m\xe1s intimas amistades pueden traicionar y las nuevas ideas pueden destruir antiguas convicciones que resultaban c\xf3modas.

What does such a Being lack? The answer? Limitation.","Being was understood as a place of action, not a place of things.31 It was understood as something more akin to story or drama. That story or drama was lived, subjective experience, as it manifested itself moment to moment in the consciousness of every living person. It was something similar to the stories we tell each other about our lives and their personal significance; something similar to the happenings that novelists describe when they capture existence in the pages of their books. Subjective experience\u2014that includes familiar objects such as trees and clouds, primarily objective in their existence, but also (and more importantly) such things as emotions and dreams as well as hunger, thirst and pain. It is such things, experienced personally, that are the most fundamental elements of human life, from the archaic, dramatic perspective, and they are not easily reducible to the detached and objective\u2014even by the modern reductionist, materialist mind.","Could you compare your specific personal tomorrow with your specific personal yesterday? Could you use your own judgment, and ask yourself what that better tomorrow might be? Aim small.

Thus, you set the following goal: by the end of the day, I want things in my life to be a tiny bit better than they were this morning. Then you ask yourself, \u201cWhat could I do, that I would do, that would accomplish that, and what small thing would I like as a reward?","These include denial (\u201cthe truth is not so bad), reaction formation (\u201cI really, really, really love my mother\u201d), displacement (\u201cthe boss yells at me, I yell at my wife, my wife yells at the baby, the baby bites the cat\u201d), identification (\u201cI am bullied, so I am motivated to be a bully\u201d), rationalization (a self-serving explanation for a low-quality action), intellectualization (a favorite of the early, funny, neurotic Woody Allen), sublimation (\u201cI can always paint nude women\u201d), and projection (\u201cI am not touchy; you are just annoying\u201d).\u201d","You are stuck with yourself.

That response was fascinating\u2014and not at all predictable. Responsibility is not an easy sell. Parents have been striving forever to make their kids responsible. Society attempts the same thing, with its educational institutions, apprenticeships, volunteer organizations, and clubs. You might even consider the inculcation of responsibility the fundamental purpose of society. But something has gone wrong. We have committed an error, or a series of errors. We have spent too much time, for example (much of the last fifty years), clamoring about rights, and we are no longer asking enough of the young people we are socializing. We have been telling them for decades to demand what they are owed by society. We have been implying that the important meanings of their lives will be given to them because of such demands, when we should have been doing the opposite: letting them know that the meaning that sustains life in all its tragedy and disappointment is to be found in shouldering a noble burden. Because we have not been doing this, they have grown up looking in the wrong places. And this has left them vulnerable: vulnerable to easy answers and susceptible to the deadening force of resentment. What about the unfolding of history has left us in this position? How has this vulnerability, this susceptibility, come about?","One might think that a generation that has heard endlessly, from their more ideological teachers, about the rights, rights, rights that belong to them, would object to being told that they would do better to focus instead on taking responsibility.","First error: Freud failed to notice that sins of omission contributed to mental illness as much as, or more than, the sins of commission, listed above, that constitute repression.

In accordance with that assumption, he believed that a memory trace existed, somewhere in the mind, that accurately represented the past, like an objective video recording. These would be reasonable presumptions, if our experience was simply a series of objectively real and self-evident events transmitted through our senses, thought about, evaluated, and then acted upon. If this was all true, traumatic experience would be accurately represented in memory, even when pushed out of awareness by unconscious mechanisms (or conscious\u2014but Freud presumed the former) because of its understood but terrible nature.

A religi\xe3o preocupa-se com o dom\xednio do valor, o valor supremo. E esse n\xe3o \xe9 um dom\xednio cient\xedfico. N\xe3o \xe9 o territ\xf3rio da descri\xe7\xe3o emp\xedrica.

And to manage this means to separate those factors within the confines of one\u2019s own soul, as well as among other people.","What you hear in the forest but cannot see might be a tiger. It might even be a conspiracy of tigers, each hungrier and more vicious than the other, led by a crocodile. But it might not be, too. If you turn and look, perhaps you\u2019ll see that it\u2019s just a squirrel. (I know someone who was actually chased by a squirrel.) Something is out there in the woods. You know that with certainty. But often it\u2019s only a squirrel.","For Jung, whatever was at the top of an individual\u2019s moral hierarchy was, for all intents and purposes, that person\u2019s ultimate value, that person\u2019s god. It was what the person acted out. It was what the person believed most deeply. Something enacted is not a fact, or even a set of facts. Instead, it\u2019s a personality\u2014or, more precisely, a choice between two opposing personalities.","We only see what we aim at. The rest of the world (and that\u2019s most of it) is hidden. If we start aiming at something different\u2014something like \u201cI want my life to be better\u2014our minds will start presenting us with new information, derived from the previously hidden world, to aid us in that pursuit.\u201d","The philosopher\u2019s stone remains undiscovered in the gutter; and the information hidden in the round chaos, beckoning, remains unexplored. Such omission is the voluntary refusal of expanded consciousness. After all, the pathway to the Holy Grail has its beginnings in the darkest part of the forest, and what you need remains hidden where you least want to look.","We live within a framework that defines the present as eternally lacking and the future as eternally better. If we did not see things this way, we would not act","Be grateful in spite of your suffering.","And what about the idea that hitting a child merely teaches them to hit? First:No. Wrong. Too simple. For starters, \u201chitting is a very unsophisticated word todescribe the disciplinary act of an effective parent. If \u201chitting\u201d accuratelydescribed the entire range of physical force, then there would be no differencebetween rain droplets and atom bombs. Magnitude matters\u2014and so doescontext, if we\u2019re not being wilfully blind and na\xefve about the issue.\u201d","That\u2019s how you deal with the overwhelming complexity of the world: you ignore it, while you concentrate minutely on your private concerns. You see things that facilitate your movement forward, toward your desired goals. You detect obstacles, when they pop up in your path. You\u2019re blind to everything else (and there\u2019s a lot of everything else\u2014so you\u2019re very blind). And it has to be that way, because there is much more of the world than there is of you. You must shepherd your limited resources carefully. Seeing is very difficult, so you must choose what to see, and let the rest go.","We process the unknown world from the bottom up. We encounter containers of information, so to speak, whose full import is by no means self-evident.","When you dare aspire upward, you reveal the inadequacy of the present and the promise of the future. Then you disturb others, in the depths of their souls, where they understand that their cynicism and immobility are unjustifiable. You play Abel to their Cain. You remind them that they ceased caring not because of life\u2019s horrors, which are undeniable, but because they do not want to lift the world up on to their shoulders, where it belongs.","But for those first affections, Those shadowy recollections, Which, be they what they may Are yet the fountain-light of all our day, Are yet a master-light of all our seeing; Uphold us, cherish, and have power to make Our noisy years seem moments in the being Of the eternal Silence: truths that wake, To perish never; Which neither listlessness, nor mad endeavour, Nor Man nor Boy, Nor all that is at enmity with joy, Can utterly abolish or destroy! \u2014William Wordsworth, \u201cOde: Intimations of Immortality from Recollections of Early Childhood","If you are suffering\u2014well, that\u2019s the norm. People are limited and life is tragic. If your suffering is unbearable, however, and you are starting to become corrupted, here\u2019s something to think about.","One forty-something client told me his vision, formulated by his younger self: \u201cI see myself retired, sitting on a tropical beach, drinking margaritas in the sunshine. That\u2019s not a plan. That\u2019s a travel poster. After eight margaritas, you\u2019re fit only to await the hangover. After three weeks of margarita-filled days, if you have any sense, you\u2019re bored stiff and self-disgusted. In a year, or less, you\u2019re pathetic. It\u2019s just not a sustainable approach to later life. This kind of oversimplification and falsification is particularly typical of ideologues.\u201d","All that matters, from a Darwinian perspective, is permanence and thedominance hierarchy, however social or cultural it might appear, has been around for some half a billion years. It\'s permanent. It\'s real. The dominance hierarchy is not capitalism. It\'s not communism, either, for that matter. It\'s not the military-industrial complex. It\'s not the patriarchy-that disposable, malleable, arbitrary cultural artefact. It\'s not even a human creation; not in the most profound sense. It is instead a near-eternal aspect of the environment, and much of what is blamed on these more ephemeral manifestations is a consequence of its unchanging existence. We (the sovereign we, the we that has been around since the beginning of life) have lived in a dominance hierarchy for a long, long time. We were struggling for position before we had skin, or hands, or lungs, or bones. There is little more natural than culture. Dominance hierarchies are older than trees.","Some people degenerate into the hell of resentment and the hatred of Being, but most refuse to do so, despite their suffering and disappointments and losses and inadequacies and ugliness, and again that is a miracle for those with the eyes to see it.","this. It seems to be a reflection, in part, of the order/chaos dichotomy characterizing all of experience, with Paradise serving as habitable order and the serpent playing the role of chaos. The serpent in Eden therefore means","Perhaps no one else would want me. Well, the rejection rate for new job applications is extraordinarily high. I tell my clients to assume 50:1, so their expectations are set properly. You are going to be passed over, in many cases, for many positions for which you are qualified. But that is rarely personal. It is, instead, a condition of existence, an inevitable consequence of somewhat arbitrary subjection to the ambivalent conditions of worth characterizing society. It is the consequence of the fact that CVs are easy to disseminate and difficult to process; that many jobs have unannounced internal candidates (and so are just going through the motions); and that some companies keep a rolling stock of applicants, in case they need to hire quickly. That is an actuarial problem, a statistical problem, a baseline problem\u2014and not necessarily an indication that there is something specifically flawed about you. You must incorporate all that sustainingly pessimistic realism into your expectations, so that you do not become unreasonably downhearted. One hundred and fifty applications, carefully chosen; three to five interviews thereby acquired. That could be a mission of a year or more. That is much less than a lifetime of misery and downward trajectory. But it is not nothing. You need to fortify yourself for it, plan, and garner support from people who understand what you are up to and are realistically appraised of the difficulty and the options.","That\u2019s where we are simultaneously stable enough, exploring enough, transforming enough, repairing enough, and cooperating enough.","Tan solo el ser humano pod\xeda concebir el potro de torturas, la doncella de hierro y el aplastapulgares.

Millennials, often told they have received the finest education available anywhere, have actually suffered a form of serious intellectual and moral neglect.\u201d","If happiness comes to you, welcome it with gratitude and open arms (but be careful, because it does make you impetuous).","All of this is very frightening. It is frightening to perceive the shells of ourselves that we have become. It is frightening to glimpse, even for a moment, the transcendent reality that exists beyond. We think we border our great paintings with luxurious, elaborate frames to glorify them, but we do it at least as much to insist to ourselves that the glory of the painting itself ends at the frame. That bounding, that bordering, leaves the world we are familiar with comfortably intact and unchanged. We do not want that beauty reaching out past the limitations imposed on it and disturbing everything that is familiar.","De ce s\u0103 refuzi s\u0103 pui degetul pe ran\u0103, de vreme ce specificarea unei probleme deschide calea c\u0103tre solu\u0163ionarea ei?

On that evidence, it renders a determination of your value and assigns you a status. If you are judged by your peers as of little worth, the counter restricts serotonin availability.","You must make friends, therefore, with what you don\u2019t know, instead of what you know. You must remain awake to catch yourself in the act. You must remove the beam in your own eye, before you concern yourself with the mote in your brother\u2019s. And in this way, you strengthen your own spirit, so it can tolerate the burden of existence, and you rejuvenate the state.","No existe ninguna obligaci\xf3n moral de respaldar a alguien que est\xe1 haciendo del mundo un lugar peor. Todo lo contrario.","He observed that the virtues always aim for balance and avoid the extremes of the vices.","Maybe your misery is the weapon you brandish in your hatred for those who rose upward while you waited and sank. Maybe your misery is your attempt to prove the world\u2019s injustice, instead of the evidence of your own sin, your own missing of the mark, your conscious refusal to strive and to live. Maybe your willingness to suffer in failure is inexhaustible, given what you use that suffering to prove. Maybe it\u2019s your revenge on Being.","What might serve as a more sophisticated alternative to happiness? Imagine it is living in accordance with the sense of responsibility, because that sets things right in the future.","Meaning emerges when impulses are regulated, organized and unified. Meaning emerges from the interplay between the possibilities of the world and the value structure operating within that world. If the value structure is aimed at the betterment of Being, the meaning revealed will be life-sustaining. It will provide the antidote for chaos and suffering. It will make everything matter. It will make everything better.","They believe, narcissistically, underneath all that bad theory, that the world could be put right, if only they held the controls.","Standing up means voluntarily accepting the burden of Being. Your nervous system responds in an entirely different manner when you face the demands of life voluntarily. You respond to a challenge, instead of bracing for a catastrophe.","All she\u2014he\u2014they\u2014or we\u2014must do to ensure such an outcome is nothing: don\u2019t notice, don\u2019t react, don\u2019t attend, don\u2019t discuss, don\u2019t consider, don\u2019t work for peace, don\u2019t take responsibility.

Better, in your own private opinion, by your own individual standards? Could you compare your specific personal tomorrow with your specific personal yesterday? Could you use your own judgment, and ask yourself what that better tomorrow might be?","Solzhenitsyn\u2019s writing utterly and finally demolished the intellectual credibility of communism, as ideology or society. He took an axe to the trunk of the tree whose bitter fruits had nourished him so poorly\u2014and whose planting he had witnessed and supported","the world, as perceived, is maya\u2014appearance or illusion. This means, in part, that people are blinded by their desires (as well as merely incapable of seeing things as they truly are). This is true, in a sense that transcends the metaphorical. Your eyes are tools. They are there to help you get what you want. The price you pay for that utility, that specific, focused direction, is blindness to everything else.","The higher good would be the simultaneous optimization of your function and the function of the people around you, across time, as we have discussed previously.","We do the same with museums, those asylums for genius: we isolate everything that is great\u2014everything that could in principle be distributed throughout the world. Why cannot every small town have a shrine devoted to one great piece of art, instead of having every piece collected in a manner impossible for anyone ever to take in at once? Is not one masterpiece enough for a room, or even for a building? Ten great works of art, or a hundred, in a single room is absurd, given that each is a world in and of itself. Such mass collection is a degrading of the unique singular particularity and worth of what is priceless and irreplaceable. It is fear that entices us to imprison art. And no wonder.","He concluded that the tweed-wearing, armchair-philosophizing, victim-identifying, pity-and-contempt-dispensing social-reformer types frequently did not like the poor, as they claimed. Instead, they just hated the rich. They disguised their resentment and jealousy with piety, sanctimony and self-righteousness.","Of course, culture is an oppressive structure. It\u2019s always been that way. It\u2019s a fundamental, universal existential reality. The tyrannical king is a symbolic truth; an archetypal constant. What we inherit from the past is willfully blind, and out of date. It\u2019s a ghost, a machine, and a monster. It must be rescued, repaired and kept at bay by the attention and effort of the living. It crushes, as it hammers us into socially acceptable shape, and it wastes great potential. But it offers great gain, too. Every word we speak is a gift from our ancestors. Every thought we think was thought previously by someone smarter. The highly functional infrastructure that surrounds us, particularly in the West, is a gift from our ancestors: the comparatively uncorrupt political and economic systems, the technology, the wealth, the lifespan, the freedom, the luxury, and the opportunity. Culture takes with one hand, but in some fortunate places it gives more with the other. To think about culture only as oppressive is ignorant and ungrateful, as well as dangerous. This is not to say (as I am hoping the content of this book has made abundantly clear, so far) that culture should not be subject to criticism.","For that, as Hitler stated so clearly, you need the lie:155 [I]n the big lie there is always a certain force of credibility; because the broad masses of a nation are always more easily corrupted in the deeper strata of their emotional nature than consciously or voluntarily; and thus in the primitive simplicity of their minds they more readily fall victims to the big lie than the small lie, since they themselves often tell small lies in little matters but would be ashamed to resort to large-scale falsehoods. It would never come into their heads to fabricate colossal untruths, and they would not believe that others could have the impudence to distort the truth so infamously. Even though the facts which prove this to be so may be brought clearly to their minds, they will still doubt and waver and will continue to think that there may be some other explanation.","When life suddenly reveals itself as intense, gripping and meaningful; when time passes and you\u2019re so engrossed in what you\u2019re doing you don\u2019t notice\u2014it is there and then that you are located precisely on the border between order and chaos. The subjective meaning that we encounter there is the reaction of our deepest being, our neurologically and evolutionarily grounded instinctive self, indicating that we are ensuring the stability but also the expansion of habitable, productive territory, of space that is personal, social and natural. It\u2019s the right place to be, in every sense. You are there when\u2014and where\u2014it matters. That\u2019s what music is telling you, too, when you\u2019re listening\u2014even more, perhaps, when you\u2019re dancing\u2014when its harmonious layered patterns of predictability and unpredictability make meaning itself well up from the most profound depths of your Being.","Nem te v\xe1lasztod ki,mi \xe9rdekel, az v\xe1laszt ki t\xe9ged.

If you are in fact his Son, God will surely save you.\u201d Why would God not make Himself manifest, to rescue His only begotten Child from hunger and isolation and the presence of great evil? But that establishes no pattern for life. It doesn\u2019t even work as literature. The deus ex machina\u2014the emergence of a divine force that magically rescues the hero from his predicament\u2014is the cheapest trick in the hack writer\u2019s playbook. It makes a mockery of independence, and courage, and destiny, and free will, and responsibility. Furthermore, God is in no wise a safety net for the blind. He\u2019s not someone to be commanded to perform magic tricks, or forced into Self-revelation\u2014not even by His own Son. \u201cDo not put the Lord your God to the test\u201d (Matthew 4:7)\u2014this answer, though rather brief, dispenses with the second temptation. Christ does not casually order or even dare ask God to intervene on his behalf. He refuses to dispense with His responsibility for the events of His own life. He refuses to demand that God prove His presence\u201d","Un objetivo reduce la ansiedad porque, si no tienes ninguno, todo puede significar cualquier cosa o nada en absoluto y ninguna de estas dos opciones permite a un esp\xedritu estar tranquilo.

Start stopping today. Don\u2019t waste time questioning how you know that what you\u2019re doing is wrong, if you are certain that it is. Inopportune questioning can confuse, without enlightening, as well as deflecting you from action. You can know that something is wrong or right without knowing why. Your entire Being can tell you something that you can neither explain nor articulate.

He claimed that nothing was so gentle and wonderful as man in his pre-civilized state. At precisely the same time, noting his inability as a father, he abandoned five of his children to the tender and fatal mercies of the orphanages of the time.","If you will not reveal yourself to others, you cannot reveal yourself to yourself. That does not only mean that you suppress who you are, although it also means that. It means that so much of what you could be will never be forced by necessity to come forward. This is a biological truth, as well as a conceptual truth. When you explore boldly, when you voluntarily confront the unknown, you gather information and build your renewed self out of that information. That is the conceptual element. However, researchers have recently discovered that new genes in the central nervous system turn themselves on when an organism is placed (or places itself) in a new situation. These genes code for new proteins. These proteins are the building blocks for new structures in the brain. This means that a lot of you is still nascent, in the most physical of senses, and will not be called forth by stasis. You have to say something, go somewhere and do things to get turned on.

The cynicism that makes that opinion a universal truism is widespread and fashionable. But such an orientation to the world is not at all characteristic of many people.

Thus, instead of narcissistically inflating their own importance, they don\u2019t value themselves at all, and they don\u2019t take care of themselves with attention and skill. It seems that people often don\u2019t really believe that they deserve the best care, personally speaking.

Do they wake up in the morning at approximately the time the typical person wakes up, and at the same time every day? If the answer is no, fixing that is the first thing I recommend. It doesn\u2019t matter so much if they go to bed at the same time each evening, but waking up at a consistent hour is a necessity. Anxiety and depression cannot be easily treated if the sufferer has unpredictable daily routines. The systems that mediate negative emotion are tightly tied to the properly cyclical circadian rhythms. The next thing I ask about is breakfast. I counsel my clients to eat a fat and protein-heavy breakfast as soon as possible after they awaken (no simple carbohydrates, no sugars, as they are digested too rapidly, and produce a blood-sugar spike and rapid dip). This is because anxious and depressed people are already stressed, particularly if their lives have not been under control for a good while. Their bodies are therefore primed to hypersecrete insulin, if they engage in any complex or demanding activity. If they do so after fasting all night and before eating, the excess insulin in their bloodstream will mop up all their blood sugar. Then they become hypoglycemic and psych\u200bophys\u200biologi\u200bcally unstable.22 All day. Their systems cannot be reset until after more sleep.

Four days later she happened upon a new physiotherapist. He was a large, powerful, attentive person. He had specialized in ankle treatment in the UK, in London. He placed his hands around her ankle and compressed it for forty seconds, while Mikhaila moved her foot back and forth. A mispositioned bone slipped back where it belonged. Her pain disappeared. She never cries in front of medical personnel, but she burst into tears. Her knee straightened up. Now she can walk long distances, and traipse around in her bare feet.

Next, your imagination populates the darkness with whatever might be making the noise.4 That is the third transmutation, part of a complete and practical sequence: embodied responses (freezing and heart-rate increase) and then imagistic, imaginative representation.

This is reflected in their relative postures. Whether a lobster is confident or cringing depends on the ratio of two chemicals that modulate communication between lobster neurons: serotonin and octopamine. Winning increases the ratio of the former to the latter. A lobster with high levels of serotonin and low levels of octopamine is a cocky, strutting sort of shellfish, much less likely to back down when challenged. This is because serotonin helps regulate postural flexion. A flexed lobster extends its appendages so that it can look tall and dangerous, like Clint Eastwood in a spaghetti Western. When a lobster that has just lost a battle is exposed to serotonin, it will stretch itself out, advance even on former victors, and fight longer and harder.9 The drugs prescribed to depressed human beings, which are selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors, have much the same chemical and behavioural effect. In one of the more staggering demonstrations of the evolutionary continuity of life on Earth, Prozac even cheers up lobsters.10 High serotonin/low octopamine characterizes the victor. The opposite neurochemical configuration, a high ratio of octopamine to serotonin, produces a defeated-looking, scrunched-up, inhibited, drooping, skulking sort of lobster, very likely to hang around street corners, and to vanish at the first hint of trouble. Serotonin and octopamine also regulate the tail-flick reflex, which serves to propel a lobster rapidly backwards when it needs to escape. Less provocation is necessary to trigger that reflex in a defeated lobster. You can see an echo of that in the heightened startle reflex characteristic of the soldier or battered child with post-traumatic stress disorder.","you have positioned yourself where the terror of existence is under control and you are secure, but where you are also alert and engaged.

This is a high price.\u201d","He chose rebirth over descent into Hell.","tedious, ideology-ridden professors.","My wife and I learned that if you ask yourself such a question, and you genuinely desire the answer (no matter how disgraceful and terrible and shameful), then a memory of something you did that was stupid and wrong at some point in the generally not-distant-enough past will arise from the depths of your mind. Then you can go back to your partner and reveal why you\u2019re an idiot, and apologize (sincerely) and that person can do the same for you, and then apologize (sincerely), and then you two idiots will be able to talk again. Perhaps that is true prayer: the question, \u201cWhat have I done wrong, and what can I do now to set things at least a little bit more right? But your heart must be open to the terrible truth. You must be receptive to that which you do not want to hear. When you decide to learn about your faults, so that they can be rectified, you open a line of communication with the source of all revelatory thought. Maybe that\u2019s the same thing as consulting your conscience. Maybe that\u2019s the same thing, in some manner, as a discussion with God.\u201d","For the Taoists, meaning is to be found on the border between the ever-entwined pair.

Why would he do such a thing? It\u2019s a stupid question. It\u2019s unacceptably naive. The answer is obvious. To dominate his mother. To see if he can get away with it. Violence, after all, is no mystery. It\u2019s peace that\u2019s the mystery. Violence is the default. It\u2019s easy. It\u2019s peace that is difficult: learned, inculcated, earned.","Nietzsche, for his part, posited that individual human beings would have to invent their own values in the aftermath of God\u2019s death. But this is the element of his thinking that appears weakest, psychologically:","(For relativists, ideals are values too, and like all values, they are merely \u201crelative and hardly worth sacrificing for.)\u201d","Our society faces the increasing call to deconstruct its stabilizing traditions to include smaller and smaller numbers of people who do not or will not fit into the categories upon which even our perceptions are based.","when","If you make what you want clear and commit yourself to its pursuit, you may fail.

The yearly rate of homicide in the modern UK is about 1 per 100,000.91 It\u2019s four to five times higher in the US, and about ninety times higher in Honduras, which has the highest rate recorded of any modern nation. But the evidence strongly suggests that human beings have become more peaceful, rather than less so, as time has progressed and societies became larger and more organized. The !Kung bushmen of Africa, romanticized in the 1950s by Elizabeth Marshall Thomas as \u201cthe harmless people,92 had a yearly murder rate of 40 per 100,000, which declined by more than 30% once they became subject to state authority.93 This is a very instructive example of complex social structures serving to reduce, not exacerbate, the violent tendencies of human beings. Yearly rates of 300 per 100,000 have been reported for the Yanomami of Brazil, famed for their aggression\u2014but the stats don\u2019t max out there. The denizens of Papua, New Guinea, kill each other at yearly rates ranging from 140 to 1000 per 100,000.94 However, the record appears to be held by the Kato, an indigenous people of California, 1450 of whom per 100,000 met a violent death circa 1840.\u201d","Set your ambitions, even if you are uncertain about what they should be. The better ambitions have to do with the development of character and ability, rather than status and power. Status you can lose. You carry character with you wherever you go, and it allows you to prevail against adversity.","it is much harder to extract someone from a chasm than to lift him from a ditch.","Look for your inspiration to the victorious lobster, with its 350 million years of practical wisdom.

You cannot hit a target if you do not take aim. And, equally dangerously, in both cases: you will not accrue the advantage of aiming, but missing. You will not benefit from the learning that inevitably takes place when things do not go your way. Success at a given endeavor often means trying, falling short, recalibrating (with the new knowledge generated painfully by the failure), and then trying again and falling short\u2014often repeated, ad nauseam.","Children can be damaged as much or more by a lack of incisive attention as they are by abuse, mental or physical. This is damage by omission, rather than commission, but it is no less severe and long-lasting.","You need to consider the future and think, \u201cWhat might my life look like if I were caring for myself properly? What career would challenge me and render me productive and helpful, so that I could shoulder my share of the load, and enjoy the consequences? What should I be doing, when I have some freedom, to improve my health, expand my knowledge, and strengthen my body?","Almost all ideas are wrong. It doesn\'t matter if they are your ideas or someone else\'s ideas. Your job is to assume that they are probably wrong, and then to assault them with every thing you have in your arsenal, and see if they can survive.","exactly? Here are some suggestions. Do not bite, kick or hit, except in self-defence. Do not torture and bully other children, so you don\u2019t end up in jail. Eat in a civilized and thankful manner, so that people are happy to have you at their house, and pleased to feed you. Learn to share, so other kids will play with you. Pay attention when spoken to by adults, so they don\u2019t hate you and might therefore deign to teach you something. Go to sleep properly, and peaceably, so that your parents can have a private life and not resent your existence. Take care of your belongings, because you need to learn how and because you\u2019re lucky to have them. Be good company when something fun is happening, so that you\u2019re invited for the fun. Act so that other people are happy you\u2019re around, so that people will want you around. A child who knows these rules will be welcome everywhere.\u201d","To conduct life like this is to become possessed by some ill-formed desire, and then to craft speech and action in a manner that appears likely, rationally, to bring about that end.

A life lived in this manner is based, consciously or unconsciously, on two premises. The first is that current knowledge is sufficient to define what is good, unquestioningly, far into the future. The second is that reality would be unbearable if left to its own devices. The first presumption is philosophically unjustifiable. What you are currently aiming at might not be worth attaining, just as what you are currently doing might be an error. The second is even worse. It is valid only if reality is intrinsically intolerable and, simultaneously, something that can be successfully manipulated and distorted. Such speaking and thinking requires the arrogance and certainty that the English poet John Milton\u2019s genius identified with Satan, God\u2019s highest angel gone most spectacularly wrong. The faculty of rationality inclines dangerously to pride: all I know is all that needs to be known. Pride falls in love with its own creations, and tries to make them absolute.\u201d","Sometimes all that learning, impossible without the failure, leads you to see that aiming your ambition in a different direction would be better (not because it is easier; not because you have given up; not because you are avoiding\u2014but because you have learned through the vicissitudes of your experience that what you seek is not to be found where you were looking, or is simply not attainable in the manner by which you chose to pursue it).","It is far better to become something than to remain anything but become nothing.","When you are visited by chaos and swallowed up; when nature curses you or someone you love with illness; or when tyranny rends asunder something of value that you have built, it is salutary to know the rest of the story. All of that misfortune is only the bitter half of the tale of existence, without taking note of the heroic element of redemption or the nobility of the human spirit requiring a certain responsibility to shoulder.","Nadie que de verdad se encuentre del lado de la humanidad podr\xeda ponerse del lado de algo as\xed.

Perhaps what you really need is right in front of your eyes, but you cannot see it because of what you are currently aiming for.","It is necessary and helpful to be, and in some ways to remain, a beginner. For this reason, the Tarot deck beloved by intuitives, romantics, fortune-tellers, and scoundrels alike contains within it the Fool as a positive card, an illustrated variant of which opens this chapter. The Fool is a young, handsome man, eyes lifted upward, journeying in the mountains, sun shining brightly upon him\u2014about to carelessly step over a cliff (or is he?). His strength, however, is precisely his willingness to risk such a drop; to risk being once again at the bottom. No one unwilling to be a foolish beginner can learn. It was for this reason, among others, that Carl Jung regarded the Fool as the archetypal precursor to the figure of the equally archetypal Redeemer, the perfected individual.","Vice is easy. Failure is easy, too. It\u2019s easier not to shoulder a burden. It\u2019s easier not to think, and not to do, and not to care. It\u2019s easier to put off until tomorrow what needs to be done today, and drown the upcoming months and years in today\u2019s cheap pleasures.","To act to justify the suffering of your parents is to remember all the sacrifices that all the others who lived before you (not least your parents) have made for you in all the course of the terrible past, to be grateful for all the progress that has been thereby made, and then to act in accordance with that remembrance and gratitude. People sacrificed immensely to bring about what we have now. In many cases, they literally died for it\u2014and we should act with some respect for that fact.","When it\u2019s not just na\xefvet\xe9, the attempt to rescue someone is often fuelled by vanity and narcissism.","maybe old Camus could have used some SSRIs.","dominance hierarchies have been an essentially permanent feature of the environment to which all complex life has adapted.","It is for such reasons that a whole generation of social psychologists recommended \u201cpositive illusions as the only reliable route to mental health.69 Their credo?

A more dismal, wretched, pessimistic philosophy can hardly be imagined: things are so terrible that only delusion can save you.\u201d","Don\u2019t over-estimate your self-knowledge.","It is possible that you have misinterpreted the situation entirely, for reasons of which you remain fundamentally unconscious.","Such children are chronically ignored by their peers. This is because they are not fun to play with. Adults tend to manifest the same attitude (although they will deny it desperately when pressed). When I worked in daycare centres, early in my career, the comparatively neglected children would come to me desperately, in their fumbling, half-formed manner, with no sense of proper distance and no attentive playfulness. They would flop, nearby\u2014or directly on my lap, no matter what I was doing\u2014driven inexorably by the powerful desire for adult attention, the necessary catalyst for further development. It was very difficult not to react with annoyance, even disgust, to such children and their too-prolonged infantilism\u2014difficult not to literally push them aside\u2014even though I felt very badly for them, and understood their predicament well. I believe that response, harsh and terrible though it may be, was an almost universally-experienced internal warning signal indicating the comparative danger of establishing a relationship with a poorly socialized child: the likelihood of immediate and inappropriate dependence (which should have been the responsibility of the parent) and the tremendous demand of time and resources that accepting such dependence would necessitate. Confronted with such a situation, potentially friendly peers and interested adults are much more likely to turn their attention to interacting with other children whose cost/benefit ratio, to speak bluntly, would be much lower.","The meta-goal could be \u201clive in truth. This means, \u201cAct diligently towards some well-articulated, defined and temporary end. Make your criteria for failure and success timely and clear, at least for yourself (and even better if others can understand what you are doing and evaluate it with you). While doing so, however, allow the world and your spirit to unfold as they will, while you act out and articulate the truth.\u201d This is both pragmatic ambition and the most courageous of faiths.\u201d","Much more of our sanity than we commonly realize is a consequence of our fortunate immersion in a social community.","I had outgrown the shallow Christianity of my youth by the time I could understand the fundamentals of Darwinian theory. After that, I could not distinguish the basic elements of Christian belief from wishful thinking. The socialism that soon afterward became so attractive to me as an alternative proved equally insubstantial; with time, I came to understand, through the great George Orwell, that much of such thinking found its motivation in hatred of the rich and successful, instead of true regard for the poor. Besides, the socialists were more intrinsically capitalist than the capitalists. They believed just as strongly in money. They just thought that if different people had the money, the problems plaguing humanity would vanish. This is simply untrue. There are many problems that money does not solve, and others that it makes worse. Rich people still divorce each other, and alienate themselves from their children, and suffer from existential angst, and develop cancer and dementia, and die alone and unloved. Recovering addicts cursed with money blow it all in a frenzy of snorting and drunkenness. And boredom weighs heavily on people who have nothing to do.","It is for such reasons that trust is vital: but trust of the mature and tragic sort. A naive person trusts because he or she believes that people are essentially or even universally trustworthy.

The highest possible goal. What is the prerequisite to pursuit of the highest possible goal? Willingness to adopt the maximum degree of responsibility\u2014and this includes the responsibilities that others disregard or neglect. You might object: \u201cWhy should I shoulder all that burden? It is nothing but sacrifice, hardship, and trouble. But what makes you so sure you do not want something heavy to carry? You positively need to be occupied with something weighty, deep, profound, and difficult. Then, when you wake up in the middle of the night and the doubts crowd in, you have some defense: \u201cFor all my flaws, which are manifold, at least I am doing this. At least I am taking care of myself. At least I am of use to my family, and to the other people around me. At least I am moving, stumbling upward, under the load I have determined to carry.\u201d","El orden -el territorio explorado- se construye a partir de caos y existe, simult\xe1neamente, en oposici\xf3n a ese caos (m\xe1s exactamente al caos *nuevo*; a lo desconocido, ahora definido en oposici\xf3n al territorio explorado).

Who is she? What\u2019s going on? Are any of her relationships real? Have any of them ever been? What has happened to the future? Everything is up for grabs, when the deeper realities of the world unexpectedly manifest themselves. Everything is intricate beyond imagining. Everything is affected by everything else. We perceive a very narrow slice of a causally interconnected matrix, although we strive with all our might to avoid being confronted by knowledge of that narrowness. The thin veneer of perceptual sufficiency cracks, however, when something fundamental goes wrong. The dreadful inadequacy of our senses reveals itself.","Knowledge frequently results from knowing others, but the man who is awakened, has seen the uncarved block.

That knowledge brings with it an arguably justified pessimism about human nature, personal and otherwise, but it also opens the door to another kind of faith in humanity: one based on courage, rather than naivete.","The neglect and mistreatment that is part and parcel of poorly structured or even entirely absent disciplinary approaches can be deliberate\u2014motivated by explicit, conscious (if misguided) parental motives.

It\u2019s the worst sort of lie. It\u2019s subtle. It avails itself of easy rationalizations. Willful blindness is the refusal to know something that could be known. It\u2019s refusal to admit that the knocking sound means someone at the door. It\u2019s refusal to acknowledge the eight-hundred-pound gorilla in the room, the elephant under the carpet, the skeleton in the closet.

It was this bad faith, this denial, that in Solzhenitsyn\u2019s opinion aided and abetted that great paranoid mass-murderer, Joseph Stalin, in his crimes. Solzhenitsyn wrote the truth, his truth, hard-learned through his own experiences in the camps, exposing the lies of the Soviet state.

Okay, so let\'s just take that apart for a minute, because it\'s a horrifying thing. So, the U.S. Armed Forces have been in the forefront of intelligence research since World War I because they were onboard early with the idea that, especially during war time when you are ramping up quickly that you need to sort people effectively and essentially without prejudice so that you can build up the officer corps so you don\'t lose the damned war, okay. So, there is real motivation to get it right, because it\'s a life-and-death issue, so they used IQ. They did a lot of the early psychometric work on IQ. Okay, so that\'s the first thing, they are motivated to find an accurate predictor, so they settled on IQ. The second thing was, the United States Armed Forces is also really motivated to get people into the Armed Forces, peacetime or wartime. Wartime, well, for obvious reasons. Peacetime, because, well, first of all you\'ve got to keep the Armed Forces going and second you can use the Armed Forces during peacetime as a way of taking people out of the underclass and moving them up into the working class or the middle class, right. You can use it as a training mechanism, and so left and right can agree on that, you know. It\'s a reasonable way of promoting social mobility. So again, the Armed Forces even in peacetime is very motivated to get as many people in as they possibly can. And it\'s difficult as well. It\'s not that easy to recruit people, so you don\'t want to throw people out if you don\'t have to. So, what\'s the upshot of all that? Well, after one hundred years, essentially, of careful statistical analysis, the Armed Forces concluded that if you had an IQ of 83 or less there wasn\'t anything you could possibly be trained to do in the military at any level of the organization that wasn\'t positively counterproductive. Okay, you think, well, so what, 83, okay. Yeah, one in ten! One in ten! That\'s one in ten people! And what that really means, as far as I can tell, is if you imagine that the military is approximately as complex as the broader society, which I think is a reasonable proposition, then there is no place in our cognitively complex society for one in ten people. So what are we going to do about that? The answer is, no one knows. You say, \\"well, shovel money down the hierarchy.\\" It\'s like, the problem isn\'t lack of money. I mean sometimes that\'s the problem, but the problem is rarely absolute poverty. It\'s rarely that. It is sometimes, but rarely. It\'s not that easy to move money down the hierarchy.

The majority of scientific papers are published by a very small group of scientists. A tiny proportion of musicians produces almost all the recorded commercial music. Just a handful of authors sell all the books. A million and a half separately titled books (!) sell each year in the US. However, only five hundred of these sell more than a hundred thousand copies.12 Similarly, just four classical composers (Bach, Beethoven, Mozart, and Tchaikovsky) wrote almost all the music played by modern orchestras. Bach, for his part, composed so prolifically that it would take decades of work merely to hand-copy his scores, yet only a small fraction of this prodigious output is commonly performed. The same thing applies to the output of the other three members of this group of hyper-dominant composers: only a small fraction of their work is still widely played. Thus, a small fraction of the music composed by a small fraction of all the classical composers who have ever composed makes up almost all the classical music that the world knows and loves.","Nietzsche and Dostoevsky both foresaw that communism would appear dreadfully attractive\u2014an apparently rational, coherent, and moral alternative to religion or nihilism\u2014and that the consequences would be lethal.","To have meaning in your life is better than to have what you want, because you may neither know what you want, nor what you truly need.","Don\u2019t think that it is easier to surround yourself with good healthy people than with bad unhealthy people.

This is not a good thing. Each person\u2019s private trouble cannot be solved by a social revolution, because revolutions are destabilizing and dangerous. We have learned to live together and organize our complex societies slowly and incrementally, over vast stretches of time, and we do not understand with sufficient exactitude why what we are doing works.

Vilfredo Pareto (1848\u20131923), an Italian polymath, noticed its applicability to wealth distribution in the early twentieth century, and it appears true for every society ever studied, regardless of governmental form. It also applies to the population of cities (a very small number have almost all the people), the mass of heavenly bodies (a very small number hoard all the matter), and the frequency of words in a language (90 percent of communication occurs using just 500 words), among many other things. Sometimes it is known as the Matthew Principle (Matthew 25:29), derived from what might be the harshest statement ever attributed to Christ: \u201cto those who have everything, more will be given; from those who have nothing, everything will be taken.","You can discipline your children, or you can turn that responsibility over to the harsh, uncaring judgmental world\u2014and the motivation for the latter decision should never be confused with love.","When we are called upon to do things that we find hateful and stupid, we are simultaneously forced to act contrary to the structure of values motivating us to move forward stalwartly and protecting us from dissolution into confusion and terror. \u201cTo thine own self be true,1 as Polonius has it, in Shakespeare\u2019s Hamlet. That \u201cself\u201d\u2014that integrated psyche\u2014is in truth the ark that shelters us when the storms gather and the water rises. To act in violation of its precepts\u2014its fundamental beliefs\u2014is to run our own ship onto the shoals of destruction. To act in violation of the precepts of that fundamental self is to cheat in the game we play with ourselves, to suffer the emptiness of betrayal, and to perceive abstractly and then experience in embodied form the loss that is inevitably to come.\u201d","I have seen people define their utopia and then bend their lives into knots trying to make it reality.

Positive feedback loops, adding effect to effect, can spiral counterproductively in a negative direction, but can also work to get you ahead.","About the first principle, you might ask, \u201cLimit the rules to what, exactly? Here are some suggestions. Do not bite, kick or hit, except in self-defence. Do not torture and bully other children, so you don\u2019t end up in jail. Eat in a civilized and thankful manner, so that people are happy to have you at their house, and pleased to feed you. Learn to share, so other kids will play with you. Pay attention when spoken to by adults, so they don\u2019t hate you and might therefore deign to teach you something. Go to sleep properly, and peaceably, so that your parents can have a private life and not resent your existence. Take care of your belongings, because you need to learn how and because you\u2019re lucky to have them. Be good company when something fun is happening, so that you\u2019re invited for the fun.

Women were often at a disadvantage during that struggle, as they had all the vulnerabilities of men, with the extra reproductive burden, and less physical strength. In addition to the filth, misery, disease, starvation, cruelty and ignorance that characterized the lives of both sexes, back before the twentieth century (when even people in the Western world typically existed on less than a dollar a day in today\u2019s money) women also had to put up with the serious practical inconvenience of menstruation, the high probability of unwanted pregnancy, the chance of death or serious damage during childbirth, and the burden of too many young children. Perhaps that is sufficient reason for the different legal and practical treatment of men and women that characterized most societies prior to the recent technological revolutions, including the invention of the birth control pill. At least such things might be taken into account, before the assumption that men tyrannized women is accepted as a truism.","Being of any reasonable sort appears to require limitation.","Describ\xed c\xf3mo hab\xeda llegado a la conclusi\xf3n de que los elementos que constitu\xedan el mundo como una obra de teatro eran el orden y el caos, y no elementos materiales.","It means adopting the burden of self-conscious vulnerability, and accepting the end of the unconscious paradise of childhood, where finitude and mortality are only dimly comprehended.

They believe, narcissistically, underneath all that bad theory, that the world could be put right, if only they held the controls.","An idea begins to take shape: \u201cI am going to live my life properly.

You are discovering who you are, and what you want, and what you are willing to do. You are finding that the solutions to your particular problems have to be tailored to you, personally and precisely. You are less concerned with the actions of other people, because you have plenty to do yourself. Attend to the day, but aim at the highest good. Now, your trajectory is heavenward.

In the Christian drama, it is also the place where vulnerability is transcended, as a consequence of its acceptance. [...] By accepting life\u2019s suffering, therefore, evil may be overcome. The alternative is hell, at least in its psychological form: rage, resentment, and the desire for revenge and destruction.","It is necessary to lift your eyes above the horizon, to establish a transcendent goal, if you wish to cease being a puppet, under the control of things you do not understand and perhaps do not want to understand.","Do not bite, kick or hit, except in self-defence.

They evoke images of prisons, soldiers and jackboots. The distance between disciplinarian and tyrant or punishment and torture is, indeed, easily traversed. Discipline and punish must be handled with care. The fear is unsurprising. But both are necessary. They can be applied unconsciously or consciously, badly or well, but there is no escaping their use.","Distress, whether psychic, physical, or intellectual, need not at all produce nihilism (that is, the radical rejection of value, meaning and desirability). Such distress always permits a variety of interpretations.","How do we establish a balance between reasonable conservatism and revitalizing creativity?","If you really loved me, you would brave the terrible landscape that I have arrayed around myself to discover the real me.","There\'s something above even the pinnacle of the highest of dominance hierarchies, access to which should not be sacrificed for mere proximal success. It\'s a real place, too, although not to be conceptualized in the standard geographical sense of place we typically use to orient ourselves. I had a vision, once, of an immense landscape, spread for miles out to the horizon before me. I was high in the air, granted a bird\'s-eye view. Everywhere I could see great stratified multi-storied pyramids of glass, some small, some large, some overlapping, some separate\u2014all akin to modern skyscrapers; all full of people striving to reach each pyramid\'s very pinnacle. But there was something above that pinnacle, a domain outside each pyramid, in which all were nested. That was the privileged position of the eye that could or perhaps chose to soar freely above the fray; that chose not to dominate any specific group or cause but instead to somehow simultaneously transcend all watchful attention, waiting to act when the time was right and the place had been established.","We are each more responsible for the state of the world than we believe, or would feel comfortable believing. Without careful attention, culture itself tilts toward corruption. Tyranny grows slowly, and asks us to retreat in comparatively tiny steps. But each retreat increases the possibility of the next retreat. Each betrayal of conscience, each act of silence (despite the resentment we feel when silenced), and each rationalization weakens resistance and increases the probability of the next restrictive move forward. This is particularly the case when those pushing forward delight in the power they have now acquired\u2014and such people are always to be found. Better to stand forward, awake, when the costs are relatively low\u2014and, perhaps, when the potential rewards have not yet vanished. Better to stand forward before the ability to do so has been irretrievably compromised. Unfortunately, people often act in spite of their conscience\u2014even if they know it\u2014and hell tends to arrive step by step, one betrayal after another. And it should be remembered that it is rare for people to stand up against what they know to be wrong even when the consequences for doing so are comparatively slight. And this is something to deeply consider, if you are concerned with leading a moral and careful life: if you do not object when the transgressions against your conscience are minor, why presume that you will not willfully participate when the transgressions get truly out of hand?","The past is not necessarily what it was, even though it has already been. The present is chaotic and indeterminate. The ground shifts continually around her feet, and ours. Equally, the future, not yet here, changes into something it was not supposed to be.","The desire for vengeance, however justified, also bars the way to other productive thoughts. The American/English poet T. S. Eliot explained why, in his play, The Cocktail Party. One of his characters is not having a good time of it. She speaks of her profound unhappiness to a psychiatrist. She says she hopes that all her suffering is her own fault. The psychiatrist is taken aback. He asks why. She has thought long and hard about this, she says, and has come to the following conclusion: if it\u2019s her fault, she might be able to do something about it. If it\u2019s God\u2019s fault, however\u2014if reality itself is flawed, hell-bent on ensuring her misery\u2014then she is doomed. She couldn\u2019t change the structure of reality itself. But maybe she could change her own life.","It\u2019s not that it\u2019s impossible to discipline with reward. In fact, rewarding good behaviour can be very effective. The most famous of all behavioural psychologists, B.F. Skinner, was a great advocate of this approach. He was expert at it. He taught pigeons to play ping-pong, although they only rolled the ball back and forth by pecking it with their beaks.101 But they were pigeons. So even though they played badly, it was still pretty good. Skinner even taught his birds to pilot missiles during the Second World War, in Project Pigeon (later Orcon).102 He got a long way, before the invention of electronic guidance systems rendered his efforts obsolete.","When you are remembering the past, as well, you remember some parts of it and forget others. You have clear memories of some things that happened, but not others, of potentially equal import\u2014just as in the present you are aware of some aspects of your surroundings and unconscious of others. You categorize your experience, grouping some elements together, and separating them from the rest. There is a mysterious arbitrariness about all of this. You don\u2019t form a comprehensive, objective record. You can\u2019t. You just don\u2019t know enough. You just can\u2019t perceive enough. You\u2019re not objective, either. You\u2019re alive. You\u2019re subjective. You have vested interests\u2014at least in yourself, at least usually. What exactly should be included in the story? Where exactly is the border between events?","Life is suffering. The Buddha stated that, explicitly. Christians portray the same sentiment imagistically, with the divine crucifix. The Jewish faith is saturated with its remembrance. The equivalence of life and limitation is the primary and unavoidable fact of existence. The vulnerability of our Being renders us susceptible to the pains of social judgement and contempt and the inevitable breakdown of our bodies.","It is good to be a beginner, but it is a good of a different sort to be an equal among equals.","You can teach virtually anyone anything with such an approach. First, figure out what you want. Then, watch the people around you like a hawk. Finally, whenever you see anything a bit more like what you want, swoop in (hawk, remember) and deliver a reward. Your daughter has been very reserved since she became a teenager. You wish she would talk more. That\u2019s the target: more communicative daughter. One morning, over breakfast, she shares an anecdote about school. That\u2019s an excellent time to pay attention. That\u2019s the reward. Stop texting and listen. Unless you don\u2019t want her to tell you anything ever again.","Sometimes, when people have a low opinion of their own worth\u2014or, perhaps, when they refuse responsibility for their lives\u2014they choose a new acquaintance, of precisely the type who proved troublesome in the past. Such people don\u2019t believe that they deserve any better\u2014so they don\u2019t go looking for it.","You are not only something that is. You are something that is becoming \u2014 and the potential extent of that becoming also transcends your understanding.","Those well positioned (and this is a great danger of moving up) have used their current competence\u2014their cherished opinions, their present knowledge, their current skills\u2014to stake a moral claim to their status. In consequence, they have little motivation to admit to error, to learn or change\u2014and plenty of reason not to.","It is far better to render Beings in your care competent than to protect","The sexual abuse of children is distressingly common.156 However, it\u2019s not as common as poorly trained psychotherapists think, and it also does not always produce terribly damaged adults.157 People vary in their resilience. An event that will wipe one person out can be shrugged off by another. But therapists with a little second-hand knowledge of Freud often axiomatically assume that a distressed adult in their practice must have been subject to childhood sexual abuse.","If you\u2019re reading this book, there\u2019s a strong probability that you\u2019re a privileged person. You can read. You have time to read. You\u2019re perched high in the clouds.","I nod. You can be pretty smart if you can just shut up.","Standing up means voluntarily accepting the burden of Being.","You should never give up the better that resides within for the security you already have\u2014and certainly not when you have already caught a glimpse, an undeniable glimpse, of something beyond.","conqueror.

If you\u2019re going to stand your ground, you better have your reasons. You better have thought them through. You might otherwise be in for a very hard landing. You should do what other people do, unless you have a very good reason not to. If you\u2019re in a rut, at least you know that other people have travelled that path. Out of the rut is too often off the road. And in the desert that awaits off the road there are highwaymen and monsters. So speaks wisdom.","Parental interventions that make children happy clearly can and should be used to shape behaviour. The same goes for husbands, wives, co-workers and parents. Skinner, however, was a realist. He noted that use of reward was very difficult: the observer had to attend patiently until the target spontaneously manifested the desired behaviour, and then reinforce. This required a lot of time, and a lot of waiting, and that\u2019s a problem. He also had to starve his animals down to three-quarters of their normal body weight before they would become interested enough in food reward to truly pay attention. But these are not the only shortcomings of the purely positive approach.","Why else would they be distressed?

We cannot live without some connection to the divine \u2014 and beauty is divine \u2014 because in its absence life is too short, too dismal, and too tragic. And we must be sharp and awake and prepared so that we can survive properly, and orient the world properly, and not destroy things, including ourselves \u2014 and beauty can help us appreciate the wonder of Being and motivate us to seek gratitude when we might otherwise be prone to destructive resentment.\u201d","At least I am taking care of myself.

It\'s unexplored territory. Chaos is what extends, eternally and without limit, beyond the boundaries of all states, all ideas, and all disciplines. It\'s the foreigner, the stranger, the member of another gang, the rustle in the bushes in the night-time, the monster under the bed, the hidden anger of your mother, and the sickness of your child. Chaos is the despair and horror you feel when you have been profoundly betrayed. It\'s the place you end up when things fall apart; when your dreams die, your career collapses, or your marriage ends. It\'s the underworld of fairytale and myth, where the dragon and the gold it guards eternally co-exist. Chaos is where we are when we don\'t know where we are, and what we are doing when we don\'t know what we are doing.

And the lyrics are destructive and nihilistic and cynical and bitter and hopeless but it does not matter, because the music beckons and calls to your spirit, and fills it with the intimation of meaning, and moves you, so that you align yourself with the patterns, and you nod your head and tap your feet to the beat, participating despite yourself. It is those patterns of sound, layered one on top of another, harmoniously, moving in the same direction, predictably and unpredictably, in perfect balance: order and chaos, in their eternal dance. And you dance with it, no matter how scornful you are. You align yourself with that patterned, directional harmony. And in that you find the meaning that sustains.\u201d","Emotions, positive and negative, come in two usefully differentiated variants. Satisfaction (technically, satiation) tells us that what we did was good, while hope (technically, incentive reward) indicates that something pleasurable is on the way. Pain hurts us, so we won\u2019t repeat actions that produced personal damage or social isolation (as loneliness is also, technically, a form of pain). Anxiety makes us stay away from hurtful people and bad places so we don\u2019t have to feel pain. All these emotions must be balanced against each other, and carefully judged in context, but they\u2019re all required to keep us alive and thriving. We therefore do our children a disservice by failing to use whatever is available to help them learn, including negative emotions, even though such use should occur in the most merciful possible manner.","You are not morally obliged to support someone who is making the world a worse place.

It has no consciousness, no will to power, no motivation, no action. There are billions of dead facts. The internet is a graveyard of dead facts. But an idea that grips a person is alive. It wants to express itself, to live in the world. It is for this reason that the depth psychologists\u2014Freud and Jung paramount among them\u2014insisted that the human psyche was a battleground for ideas. An idea has an aim. It wants something. It posits a value structure. An idea believes that what it is aiming for is better than what it has now. It reduces the world to those things that aid or impede its realization, and it reduces everything else to irrelevance. An idea defines figure against ground. An idea is a personality, not a fact. When it manifests itself within a person, it has a strong proclivity to make of that person its avatar: to impel that person to act it out. Sometimes, that impulsion (possession is another word) can be so strong that the person will die, rather than allowing the idea to perish. This is, generally speaking, a bad decision, given that it is often the case that only the idea need die, and that the person with the idea can stop being its avatar, change his or her ways, and continue","If you\u2019re reading this book, there\u2019s a strong probability that you\u2019re a privileged person.

Nothing can be judged in the absence of that end place, that higher value. Without it, everything sinks into meaninglessness and boredom or degenerates and spirals into terror, anxiety, and pain. But, as time changes all things inexorably, every specific, value-predicated story may fail, in its particular incarnation and locale, and need replacement by something newer, more complete, but different. In consequence, the actor of a given story (and, therefore, someone deeply affiliated with the plot and the characterization) still must bow to the spirit of creative transformation that originally created and may need to destroy and re-create that story.

We experience almost all the emotions that make life deep and engaging as a consequence of moving successfully towards something deeply desired and valued. The price we pay for that involvement is the inevitable creation of hierarchies of success, while the inevitable consequence is difference in outcome. Absolute equality would therefore require the sacrifice of value itself\u2014and then there would be nothing worth living for. We might instead note with gratitude that a complex, sophisticated culture allows for many games and many successful players, and that a well-structured culture allows the individuals that compose it to play and to win, in many different fashions.","What can I not doubt? The reality of suffering. It brooks no arguments. Nihilists cannot undermine it with skepticism. Totalitarians cannot banish it. Cynics cannot escape from its reality. Suffering is real, and the artful infliction of suffering on another, for its own sake, is wrong. That became the cornerstone of my belief.

The sovereign individual, awake and attending to his or her conscience, is the force that prevents the group, as the necessary structure guiding normative social relations, from becoming blind and deadly.","Si algo constituye una plaga, tal y como afirma el naturalista David Attenborough,186 o un c\xe1ncer, como se\xf1alaba el Club de Roma,187 quien lo erradique ser\xe1 un h\xe9roe, o un verdadero salvador planetario en este caso.","You don\u2019t understand how what you want\u2014and, therefore, what you see\u2014is conditioned by the immense, abysmal, profound past.

They will fight, instead, to maintain the match between what they believe, what they expect, and what they desire. They will fight to maintain the match between what they expect and how everyone is acting. It is precisely the maintenance of that match that enables everyone to live together peacefully, predictably and productively. It reduces uncertainty and the chaotic mix of intolerable emotions that uncertainty inevitably produces.","Perhaps you are overvaluing what you don\u2019t have and undervaluing what you do. There\u2019s some real utility in gratitude. It\u2019s also good protection against the dangers of victimhood and resentment.","There are only two major reasons for resentment: being taken advantage of (or allowing yourself to be taken advantage of), or whiny refusal to adopt responsibility and grow up.

They start hanging around the dominant lobster\u2019s pad, spraying attractive scents and aphrodisiacs towards him, trying to seduce him. His aggression has made him successful, so he\u2019s likely to react in a dominant, irritable manner. Furthermore, he\u2019s large, healthy and powerful. It\u2019s no easy task to switch his attention from fighting to mating. (If properly charmed, however, he will change his behaviour towards the female. This is the lobster equivalent of Fifty Shades of Grey, the fastest-selling paperback of all time, and the eternal Beauty-and-the-Beast plot of archetypal romance. This is the pattern of behaviour continually represented in the sexually explicit literary fantasies that are as popular among women as provocative images of naked women are among men.)","IMAGINE WHO YOU COULD BE, AND THEN AIM SINGLE-MINDEDLY AT THAT Who Are You\u2014and Who Could You Be?

And your ignorance is further complicated by the intermingling of who you are with who you could be. You are not only something that is. You are something that is becoming\u2014and the potential extent of that becoming also transcends your understanding.

It is for this reason that the depth psychologists\u2014Freud and Jung paramount among them\u2014insisted that the human psyche was a battleground for ideas. An idea has an aim. It wants something. It posits a value structure. An idea believes that what it is aiming for is better than what it has now.

Se trata de otra variante de la conversaci\xf3n de dominaci\xf3n y jerarqu\xeda. Durante este tipo de conversaciones, que suelen aproximarse a cuestiones ideol\xf3gicas, la persona que posee el turno de palabra: 1) se esfuerza por denigrar o ridiculizar el punto de vista de cualquiera que mantenga una postura distinta a la suya; 2) utiliza para ello pruebas cuidadosamente seleccionadas; y 3) impresiona a los interlocutores, muchos de los cuales comparten su mismo espacio ideol\xf3gico con la validez de sus afirmaciones.

They sacrifice themselves for others, sometimes excessively, and cannot comprehend why that is not reciprocated. Agreeable people are compliant, and this robs them of their independence. The danger associated with this can be amplified by high trait neuroticism. Agreeable people will go along with whoever makes a suggestion, instead of insisting, at least sometimes, on their own way. So, they lose their way, and become indecisive and too easily swayed. If they are, in addition, easily frightened and hurt, they have even less reason to strike out on their own, as doing so exposes them to threat and danger (at least in the short term). That\u2019s the pathway to dependent personality disorder, technically speaking.","Tolkien\u2019s Bilbo must become a thief before he can become a hero. He must incorporate his monstrousness, so that he can supersede his naive harmlessness, before he is tough enough to face the terrors that confront him.","Unfortunately, that physical hyper-response, that constant alertness, burns up a lot of precious energy and physical resources. This response is really what everyone calls stress, and it is by no means only or even primarily psychological. It\u2019s a reflection of the genuine constraints of unfortunate circumstances.","To retool, to take stock, to aim somewhere better, you have to think it through, bottom to top. You have to scour your psyche. You have to clean the damned thing up. And you must be cautious, because making your life better means adopting a lot of responsibility, and that takes more effort and care than living stupidly in pain and remaining arrogant, deceitful and resentful.","The world can be validly construed as a forum for action, as well as a place of things. We describe the world as a place of things, using the formal methods of science. The techniques of narrative, however \u2013 myth, literature, and drama \u2013 portray the world as a forum for action. The two forms of representation have been unnecessarily set at odds, because we have not yet formed a clear picture of their respective domains. The domain of the former is the \'objective world\' \u2013 what is, from the perspective of intersubjective perception. The domain of the latter is \'the world of value\' \u2013 what is and what should be, from the perspective of emotion and action.The world as forum for action is \'composed,\' essentially, of three constituent elements, which tend to manifest themselves in typical patterns of metaphoric representation. First is unexplored territory \u2013 the Great Mother, nature, creative and destructive, source and final resting place of all determinate things. Second is explored territory \u2013 the Great Father, culture, protective and tyrannical, cumulative ancestral wisdom. Third is the process that mediates between unexplored and explored territory \u2013 the Divine Son, the archetypal individual, creative exploratory \'Word\' and vengeful adversary. We are adapted to this \'world of divine characters,\' much as the \'objective world.\' The fact of this adaptation implies that the environment is in \'reality\' a forum for action, as well as a place of things.Unprotected exposure to unexplored territory produces fear. The individual is protected from such fear as a consequence of \'ritual imitation of the Great Father\' \u2013 as a consequence of the adoption of group identity, which restricts the meaning of things, and confers predictability on social interactions. When identification with the group is made absolute, however \u2013 when everything has to be controlled, when the unknown is no longer allowed to exist \u2013 the creative exploratory process that updates the group can no longer manifest itself. This \'restriction of adaptive capacity\' dramatically increases the probability of social aggression and chaos.Rejection of the unknown is tantamount to \'identification with the devil,\' the mythological counterpart and eternal adversary of the world-creating exploratory hero. Such rejection and identification is a consequence of Luciferian pride, which states: all that I know is all that is necessary to know. This pride is totalitarian assumption of omniscience \u2013 is adoption of \'God\u2019s place\' by \'reason\' \u2013 is something that inevitably generates a state of personal and social being indistinguishable from hell. This hell develops because creative exploration \u2013 impossible, without (humble) acknowledgment of the unknown \u2013 constitutes the process that constructs and maintains the protective adaptive structure that gives life much of its acceptable meaning.\'Identification with the devil\' amplifies the dangers inherent in group identification, which tends of its own accord towards pathological stultification. Loyalty to personal interest \u2013 subjective meaning \u2013 can serve as an antidote to the overwhelming temptation constantly posed by the possibility of denying anomaly. Personal interest \u2013 subjective meaning \u2013 reveals itself at the juncture of explored and unexplored territory, and is indicative of participation in the process that ensures continued healthy individual and societal adaptation.Loyalty to personal interest is equivalent to identification with the archetypal hero \u2013 the \'savior\' \u2013 who upholds his association with the creative \'Word\' in the face of death, and in spite of group pressure to conform. Identification with the hero serves to decrease the unbearable motivational valence of the unknown; furthermore, provides the individual with a standpoint that simultaneously transcends and maintains the group.","Agresija je u temelju ljudskoga poriva da bude izniman, nezaustavljiv, da se natje\u010de i pobijedi - da bude krjepostan, barem u jednom segmentu.

The great thinker\u2019s opinion stemmed from his fear that all the Judeo-Christian values serving as the foundation of Western civilization had been made dangerously subject to casual rational criticism, and that the most important axiom upon which they were predicated\u2014the existence of a transcendent, all-powerful deity\u2014had been fatally challenged. Nietzsche concluded from this that everything would soon fall apart, in a manner catastrophic both psychologically and socially.","Istina uvijek iznova izvire iz najdubljih izvora Bi\u0107a.

Random wandering will not move you forward. It will instead disappoint and frustrate you and make you anxious and unhappy and hard to get along with (and then resentful, and then vengeful, and then worse). Say what you mean, so that you can find out what you mean. Act out what you say, so you can find out what happens. Then pay attention. Note your errors. Articulate them. Strive to correct them. That is how you discover the meaning of your life. That will protect you from the tragedy of your life. How could it be otherwise?","At some point in our evolutionary and cultural history, we began to understand that human evil could rightly be considered the greatest of all snakes.","Animals do not seem to consider the future in the same manner as we do. If you visit the African veldt, and you observe a herd of zebras, you will often see lions lazing about around them. And as long as the lions are lying around relaxing, the zebras really do not mind. This attitude seems a little thoughtless, from the human perspective. The zebras should instead be biding their time until the lions go to sleep. Then they should run off to a corner of the field in a herd and conspire a bit. And then several dozen of them should rush the sleeping lions and stomp them to death. That would be the end of the lion problem. But that is not what zebras do. They think, \u201cAh, look at those relaxed lions! Relaxed lions are never a problem! Zebras do not seem to have any real sense of time. They cannot conceptualize themselves across the temporal expanse. But human beings not only manage such conceptualization, they cannot shake it. We discovered the future, some long time ago\u2014and now the future is where we each live, in potential. We treat that as reality. It is a reality that only might be\u2014but it is one with a high probability of becoming now, eventually, and we are driven to take that into account.\u201d","Scientific truths were made explicit a mere five hundred years ago, with the work of Francis Bacon, Ren\xe9 Descartes and Isaac Newton.

Alternatively, he suggested, people would turn to identification with rigid, totalitarian ideology: the substitute of human ideas for the transcendent Father of All Creation. The doubt that undermines and the certainty that crushes: Nietzsche\u2019s prognostication for the two alternatives that would arise in the aftermath of the death of God.","Viewpoint One is an avatar in a simulated world.

Anxiety and depression cannot be easily treated if the sufferer has unpredictable daily routines.","I have seen a husband adapt honestly and courageously while his wife descended into terminal dementia. He made the necessary adjustments, step by step. He accepted help when he needed it. He refused to deny her sad deterioration and in that manner adapted gracefully to it. I saw the family of that same woman come together in a supporting and sustaining manner as she lay dying, and gain newfound connections with each other\u2014brother, sisters, grandchildren and father\u2014as partial but genuine compensation for their loss. I have seen my teenage daughter live through the destruction of her hip and her ankle and survive two years of continual, intense pain and emerge with her spirit intact. I watched her younger brother voluntarily and without resentment sacrifice many opportunities for friendship and social engagement to stand by her and us while she suffered. With love, encouragement, and character intact, a human being can be resilient beyond imagining. What cannot be borne, however, is the absolute ruin produced by tragedy and deception.","What can I not doubt? The reality of suffering. It brooks no arguments. Nihilists cannot undermine it with skepticism. Totalitarians cannot banish it. Cynics cannot escape from its reality. Suffering is real, and the artful infliction of suffering on another, for its own sake, is wrong. That became the cornerstone of my belief. Searching through the lowest reaches of human thought and action, understanding my own capacity to act like a Nazi prison guard or a gulag archipelago trustee or a torturer of children in a dungeon, I grasped what it meant to \u201ctake the sins of the world onto oneself. Each human being has an immense capacity for evil. Each human being understands, a priori, perhaps not what is good, but certainly what is not. And if there is something that is not good, then there is something that is good. If the worst sin is the torment of others, merely for the sake of the suffering produced\u2014then the good is whatever is diametrically opposed to that. The good is whatever stops such things from happening.\u201d","Art bears the same relationship to society that the dream bears to mental life.","Events, as they lay themselves out in front of us, do not simply inform us of why they occur, and we do not remember the past in order to objectively record bounded, well-defined events and situations. The latter act is impossible, in any case. The information in our experience is latent, like gold in ore\u2014the case we made in Rule II. It must be extracted and refined with great effort, and often in collaboration with other people, before it can be employed to improve the present and the future. We use our past effectively when it helps us repeat desirable\u2014and avoid repeating undesirable\u2014experiences. We want to know what happened but, more importantly, we want to know why. Why is wisdom. Why enables us to avoid making the same mistake again and again, and if we are fortunate helps us repeat our successes.","Nuestro gran poder tecnol\xf3gico convierte las consecuencias de nuestros errores y debilidades individuales en cosas cada vez m\xe1s graves; si deseamos seguir expandiendo nuestro poder, tambi\xe9n debemos expandir continuamente nuestro saber.

Not even the best-lived life provides an absolute defence against vulnerability. But the family that fights in the ruins of their earthquake-devastated dwelling place is much less likely to rebuild than the family made strong by mutual trust and devotion. Any natural weakness or existential challenge, no matter how minor, can be magnified into a serious crisis with enough deceit in the individual, family or culture.","Extracting useful information from experience is difficult. It requires the purest of motivations (\u201cthings should be made better, not worse) to perform it properly.

Make that an axiom: to the best of my ability I will act in a manner that leads to the alleviation of unnecessary pain and suffering.

The alternative was the twentieth century. The alternative was so close to Hell that the difference is not worth discussing. And the opposite of Hell is Heaven. To place the alleviation of unnecessary pain and suffering at the pinnacle of your hierarchy of value is to work to bring about the Kingdom of God on Earth.

This is a counterproductive game, designed both to harm the dissenter and to unjustly raise your personal status. By contrast, if you are called upon to summarise someone\'s position so that the speaking person agrees with that summary, you may have to state the argument even more clearly and succinctly than the speaker has even yet managed. If you first give the devil his due, looking at his arguments from his perspective, you can (1) find the value in them, and learn something in the process, or (2) hone your position against them (if you still believe they are wrong) and strengthen your arguments further against challenge. This will make you much stronger. Then you will no longer have to misrepresent your opponent\'s position (and may well have bridged at least part of the gap between the two of you). You will also be much better at withstanding your own doubt.","A voluntary death-and-rebirth transformation\u2014the change necessary to adapt when terrible things emerge\u2014is therefore a solution to the potentially fatal rigidity of erroneous certainty, excessive order, and stultification.","Unfortunately, in the longer term, this willful blindness leaves life murky and foggy; leaves it void, unseen, without form, confused\u2014and leaves you bewildered and astonished.","Escogemos un camino u otro en cada punto de decisi\xf3n de nuestra vida, y acabamos siendo la suma total de nuestras decisiones.

A listening person is a representative of common humanity. He stands for the crowd. Now the crowd is by no means always right, but it\u2019s commonly right. It\u2019s typically right. If you say something that takes everyone aback, therefore, you should reconsider what you said. I say that, knowing full well that controversial opinions are sometimes correct\u2014sometimes so much so that the crowd will perish if it refuses to listen. It is for this reason, among others, that the individual is morally obliged to stand up and tell the truth of his or her own experience. But something new and radical is still almost always wrong.

You better have thought them through. You might otherwise be in for a very hard landing. You should do what other people do, unless you have a very good reason not to. If you\u2019re in a rut, at least you know that other people have travelled that path. Out of the rut is too often off the road. And in the desert that awaits off the road there are highwaymen and monsters. So speaks wisdom.","Expedience is the following of blind impulse. It\u2019s short-term gain. It\u2019s narrow, and selfish. It lies to get its way. It takes nothing into account. It\u2019s immature and irresponsible. Meaning is its mature replacement. Meaning emerges when impulses are regulated, organized and unified. Meaning emerges from the interplay between the possibilities of the world and the value structure operating within that world. If the value structure is aimed at the betterment of Being, the meaning revealed will be life-sustaining. It will provide the antidote for chaos and suffering. It will make everything matter. It will make everything better. If you act properly, your actions allow you to be psychologically integrated now, and tomorrow, and into the future, while you benefit yourself, your family, and the broader world around you. Everything will stack up and align along a single axis. Everything will come together.

Such questions define the state of confusion you occupy chronically when the bottom has fallen out of your world. That state can have an objective element, because a fall is often caused by something real, such as a death, a serious illness, or a bout of unemployment; but it is also subjective, associated with a state composed of pain, doubt, confusion, and the inability to choose\u2014or even perceive\u2014a path forward.","People remain mentally healthy not merely because of the integrity of their own minds, but because they are constantly being reminded how to think, act, and speak by those around them.","When you next find yourself in a dispute: stop the discussion for a moment, and institute this rule: Each person can speak up for himself only after he has first restated the ideas and feelings of the previous speaker accurately and to that speaker\'s satisfaction.","The ground of Being is subject and object simultaneously\u2014motivation, emotion, and material thing all at once\u2014before perception is clarified, before the world is articulated.","Cuando el caos te sobreviene y te fagocita, cuando la naturaleza te maldice a ti o alguien que amas con la enfermand o cuando la tiran\xeda hace pedazos algo valioso que has erigido, es saludable conocer el resto de la historia.

That is what Freud recommended. He had his patients lie on a couch, look at the ceiling, let their minds wander, and say whatever wandered in. That\u2019s his method of free association. That\u2019s the way the Freudian psychoanalyst avoids transferring his or her own personal biases and opinions into the internal landscape of the patient.","people depend on constant communication with others to keep their minds organized. We all need to think to keep things straight, but we mostly think by talking.

We need to talk about the nature of the present and our plans for the future, so we know where we are, where we are going, and why we are going there. We must submit the strategies and tactics we formulate to the judgments of others, to ensure their efficiency and resilience. We need to listen to ourselves as we talk, as well, so that we may organize our otherwise inchoate bodily reactions, motivations, and emotions into something articulate and organized, and dispense with those concerns that are exaggerated and irrational.

Meaning is the Way, the path of life more abundant, the place you live when you are guided by Love and speaking Truth and when nothing you want or could possibly want takes any precedence over precisely that. Do what is meaningful, not what is expedient.","If you shirk the responsibility of confronting the unexpected, even when it appears in manageable doses, reality itself will become unsustainably disorganized and chaotic.

He did not want their spontaneous meditations to be altered by his emotional expressions, no matter how slight. He was properly concerned that his own opinions\u2014and, worse, his own unresolved problems\u2014would find themselves uncontrollably reflected in his responses and reactions, conscious and unconscious alike. He was afraid that he would in such a manner detrimentally affect the development of his patients. It was for such reasons, as well, that Freud insisted that psychoanalysts be analyzed themselves. He wanted those who practiced his method to uncover and eliminate some of their own worst blind spots and prejudices, so they would not practise corruptly.","Alongside the wisdom of true conservatism is the danger that the status quo might become corrupt and its corruption self-servingly exploited.

It is a fortunate happenstance, generally speaking, that your idiosyncrasies are likely to be somewhat randomly distributed, and that if you unite with someone else, you are likely to find some strength where you are weak, and vice versa. When you unite the two of you to create that original \'divine being\' (that is the symbolic idea), then you have a chance of producing one reasonable, sane being. That is good for you both, even better for your children, who now have a fighting chance of adapting to what constitutes generally sane behavior; and it is good for friendship and the broader world, too.","Romance requires trust\u2014and the deeper the trust, the deeper the possibility for romance. But trust has its requirements, as well, apart from the courage required of the individuals wise enough to distrust but brave enough to risk putting their faith in a partner. The first of those requirements is truth. You cannot maintain trust in yourself if you lie. You cannot maintain trust in yourself, likewise, if you act in a manner that would require a lie if it was discovered. Similarly, you cannot maintain trust in your partner if he or she lies, or betrays you in action or in silence.

If that turns out to mean something other\u201d","Individuals who take this route, this alternative to nihilism and totalitarianism, must therefore produce their own cosmology of values.","cogito ergo sum (I think, therefore I am).","Pay Attention Pay attention. Focus on your surroundings, physical and psychological. Notice something that bothers you, that concerns you, that will not let you be, which you could fix, that you would fix. You can find such somethings by asking yourself (as if you genuinely want to know) three questions: \u201cWhat is it that is bothering me? \u201cIs that something I could fix?\u201d and \u201cWould I actually be willing to fix it?\u201d If you find that the answer is \u201cno,\u201d to any or all of the questions, then look elsewhere. Aim lower. Search until you find something that bothers you, that you could fix, that you would fix, and then fix it. That might be enough for the day.\u201d","We deserve some respect. You deserve some respect. You are important to other people, as much as to yourself. You have some vital role to play in the unfolding destiny of the world. You are, therefore, morally obliged to take care of yourself. You should take care of, help and be good to yourself the same way you would take care of, help and be good to someone you loved and valued. You may therefore have to conduct yourself habitually in a manner that allows you some respect for your own","One of these is chaos. Another is order. The third (as there are three) is the process that mediates between the two, which appears identical to what modern people call consciousness.","So deep a malice, to confound the Race Of Mankind in one Root, and Earth with Hell to mingle and involve\u2014done all to spite the Great Creator . . .133","The past is not necessarily what it was, even though it has already been. The present is chaotic and indeterminate.","Sometimes, when people have a low opinion of their own worth - or, perhaps, when they refuse responsibility for their lives - they choose a new acquaintance, of precisely the type who proved troublesome in the past. Such people don\'t believe that they deserve any better. Freud called this a \\"repetition compulsion.\\" He thought of it as an unconscious drive to repeat the horrors of the past - sometimes, perhaps, to formulate those horrors more precisely, because no alternatives beckon.","Hell is a place of drop ceilings, rusted ventilation grates, and fluorescent lights; the dismal ugliness and dreariness and general depression of spirit that results from these cost-saving features no doubt suppresses productivity far more than the cheapest of architectural tricks and the most deadening of lights saves money. Everyone looks like a corpse under fluorescents. Penny-wise and pound-foolish indeed.","The better ambitions have to do with the development of character and ability, rather than status and power.","Forty days is a long time in the underworld of dark assumptions, confusion and fear\u2014long enough to journey to the very center, which is Hell itself.","than chasing my boss\u2019s job, I will accept that and I will move forward. Now you\u2019re on a whole different kind of trajectory. Before, what was right, desirable, and worthy of pursuit was something narrow and concrete. But you became stuck there, tightly jammed and unhappy. So you let go. You make the necessary sacrifice, and allow a whole new world of possibility, hidden from you because of your previous ambition, to reveal itself. And there\u2019s a lot there. What would your life look like, if it were better? What would Life Itself look like? What does \u201cbetter\u201d even mean? You don\u2019t know. And it doesn\u2019t matter that you don\u2019t know, exactly, right away, because you will start to slowly see what is \u201cbetter,\u201d once you have truly decided to want it. You will start to perceive what remained hidden from you by your presuppositions and preconceptions\u2014by the previous mechanisms of your vision. You will begin to learn.\u201d","No one unwilling to be a foolish beginner can learn.","Do not hide unwanted things in the fog.","Did what I want happen? No. Then the world is unfair. People are jealous, and too stupid to understand. It is the fault of something or someone else. That is the voice of inauthenticity.\u201d","Maybe there is a stack of paper on your desk, and you have been avoiding it. You won\u2019t even really look at it, when you walk into your room. There are terrible things lurking there: tax forms, and bills and letters from people wanting things you aren\u2019t sure you can deliver. Notice your fear, and have some sympathy for it. Maybe there are snakes in that pile of paper. Maybe you\u2019ll get bitten. Maybe there are even hydras lurking there. You\u2019ll cut off one head, and seven more will grow. How could you possibly cope with that?","Mo\u017eete rije\u010dima nastojati izmanipulirati svijet tako da dobijete od njega ono \u0161to \u017eelite. To nazivamo \'\'politi\u010dkim djelovanjem\'\'. To je spin. To je specijalnost beskrupuloznih marketin\u0161kih stru\u010dnjaka, trgovaca, ogla\u0161iva\u010da, opsjenara, utopista opsjednutih sloganima i psihopata. Kada poku\u0161avaju utjecati na druge i manipulirati njima, ljudi se koriste govorom. To rade studenti kada pi\u0161u esej kojim \u017eelje udovoljiti profesoru, umjesto da artikuliraju i izna\u0111u vlastite ideje. To je ono \u0161to svi rade kada ne\u0161to \u017eele i odlu\u010de se pretvarati i lagati da bi udovoljili i laskali. To je spletkarenje, izmi\u0161ljanje parola i propaganda.","Someone with experience knows that people are capable of deception and willing to deceive. That knowledge brings with it an arguably justified pessimism about human nature, personal and otherwise, but it also opens the door to another kind of faith in humanity: one based on courage, rather than naivete. I will trust you\u2014I will extend my hand to you\u2014despite the risk of betrayal, because it is possible, through trust, to bring out the best in you, and perhaps in me.","Ali osobno \u017ertvovanje i rad puno nas djelotvornije \u010duvaju od patnje negoli kratkoro\u010dni impulzivni u\u017eici.","People exchange information about how to act in many ways. They observe each other and imitate what they see. When they imitate, they use their bodies to represent the bodies of others. But this imitation is not mindless, automatized mimicry. It is instead the ability to identify regularities or patterns in the behavior of other people, and then to imitate those patterns.","Our ancestors acted out a drama, a fiction: they personified the force that governs fate as a spirit that can be bargained with, traded with, as if it were another human being. And the amazing thing is that it worked.","The original Man and Woman, existing in unbroken unity with their Creator, did not appear conscious (and certainly not self-conscious). Their eyes were not open. But, in their perfection, they were also less, not more, than their post-Fall counterparts. Their goodness was something bestowed, rather than deserved or earned. They exercised no choice. God knows, that\u2019s easier. But maybe it\u2019s not better than, for example, goodness genuinely earned. Maybe, even in some cosmic sense (assuming that consciousness itself is a phenomenon of cosmic significance), free choice matters. Who can speak with certainty about such things? I am unwilling to take these questions off the table, however, merely because they are difficult. So, here\u2019s a proposition: perhaps it is not simply the emergence of self-consciousness and the rise of our moral knowledge of Death and the Fall that besets us and makes us doubt our own worth. Perhaps it is instead our unwillingness\u2014reflected in Adam\u2019s shamed hiding\u2014to walk with God, despite our fragility and propensity for evil.","Emergency\u2014emergence(y). This is the sudden manifestation from somewhere unknown of some previously unknown phenomenon (from the Greek phainesthai, to \u201cshine forth). This is the reappearance of the eternal dragon, from its eternal cavern, from its now-disrupted slumber.\u201d","DA POR HECHO QUE LA PERSONA A LA QUE ESCUCHAS PUEDE SABER ALGO QUE T\xda NO SABES","It is easier and more direct to represent a behavioral pattern with behavior than with words. Outright mimicry does that directly, action for action. Imitation, which can produce new behaviors akin to those that motivated the mimicry, takes that one step further.","NOTICE THAT OPPORTUNITY LURKS WHERE RESPONSIBILITY HAS BEEN ABDICATED","You could ask yourself, \u201cIs there anything at all that I might be willing to do about that pile of paper? Would I look, maybe, at one part of it? For twenty minutes? Maybe the answer will be, \u201cNo!\u201d But you might look for ten, or even for five (and if not that, for one). Start there. You will soon find that the entire pile shrinks in significance, merely because you have looked at part of it.\u201d","To have others attend to what you find important or interesting is to validate, first, the importance of what you are attending to, but second, and more crucially, to validate you as a respected center of conscious experience and contributor to the collective world.","I\u2019m a collaborator and opponent even when I\u2019m not talking. I can\u2019t help it. My expressions broadcast my response, even when they\u2019re subtle.","Make Yourself Invaluable","And you\u2019ll find that the whole thing is made of parts. What if you allowed yourself a glass of wine with dinner, or curled up on the sofa and read, or watched a stupid movie, as a reward? What if you instructed your wife, or your husband, to say \u201cgood job after you fixed whatever you fixed? Would that motivate you? The people from whom you want thanks might not be very proficient in offering it, to begin with, but that shouldn\u2019t stop you. People can learn, even if they are very unskilled at the beginning.\u201d","En estado natural, por decirlo de alg\xfan modo, a los seres humanos no les gusta pensar como l\xf3gicos, ni siquiera como empiristas.
