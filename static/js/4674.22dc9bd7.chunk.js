Since we cherish a trust like this, let our outward actions be in accord with it, and let us keep our hearts pure and our minds calm.","... being perpetually charmed by his familiar siren, that is, by his geometry, he neglected to eat and drink and took no care of his person; that he was often carried by force to the baths, and when there he would trace geometrical figures in the ashes of the fire, and with his finger draws lines upon his body when it was anointed with oil, being in a state of great ecstasy and divinely possessed by his science.","As those that pull down private houses adjoining to the temples of the gods, prop up such parts as are contiguous to them; so, in undermining bashfulness, due regard is to be had to adjacent modesty, good-nature and humanity.","To conduct great matters and never commit a fault is above the force of human nature.","A friend should be like money, tried before being required, not found faulty in our need.","Blinded as they are to their true character by self-love, every man is his own first and chiefest flatterer, prepared, therefore, to welcome the flatterer from the outside, who only comes confirming the verdict of the flatterer within.","There is no perfecter endowment in man than political virtue.","An old doting fool, with one foot already in the grave.","Hesiod might as well have kept his breath to cool his pottage.","Rome was in the most dangerous inclination to change on account of the unequal distribution of wealth and property, those of highest rank and greatest spirit having impoverished themselves by shows, entertainments, ambition of offices, and sumptuous buildings, and the riches of the city having thus fallen into the hands of mean and low-born persons. So that there wanted but a slight impetus to set all in motion, it being in the power of every daring man to overturn a sickly commonwealth.","He who busies himself in mean occupations, produces in the very pains he takes about things of little or no use, an evidence against himself of his negligence and indisposition to what is really good","Statesmen are not only liable to give an account of what they say or do in public, but there is a busy inquiry made into their very meals, beds, marriages, and every other sportive or serious action.","Playing the Cretan with the Cretans (i.e. lying to liars).","Talkativeness has another plague attached to it, even curiosity; for praters wish to hear much that they may have much to say.","The first evil those who are prone to talk suffer, is that they hear nothing.","Authority and place demonstrate and try the tempers of men, by moving every passion and discovering every frailty.","When men are arrived at the goal, they should not turn back.","After he routed Pharnaces Ponticus at the first assault, he wrote thus to his friends: \\"I came, I saw, I conquered.","One made the observation of the people of Asia that they were all slaves to one man, merely because they could not pronounce that syllable No.","He [Caesar] loved the treason, but hated the traitor.","The first man . . . ventured to call food and nourishment the parts that had a little before bellowed and cried, moved and lived. How could his eyes endure the slaughter when throats were slit and hides flayed and limbs torn from limb? How could his nose endure the stench? How was it that the pollution did not turn away his taste, which made contact with the sores of others and sucked juices and serums from mortal wounds?","What is bigger than an elephant?

For they only honour the valiant and admire the wise, while in addition they also love just men, and put entire trust and confidence in them.","The belly has no ears.","Cicero said loud-bawling orators were driven by their weakness to noise, as lame men to take horse.","Extraordinary rains pretty generally fall after great battles.","Children are to be won to follow liberal studies by exhortations and rational motives, and on no account to be forced thereto by whipping.","Justice makes the life of such as are in prosperity, power and authority the life of a god, and injustice turns it to that of a beast.","Grief is natural; the absence of all feeling is undesirable, but moderation in grief should be observed, as in the face of all good or evil.","There is no debt with so much prejudice put off as that of justice.","Painting is silent poetry, and poetry is painting that speaks.","Moral habits, induced by public practices, are far quicker in making their way into men\'s private lives, than the failings and faults of individuals are in infecting the city at large.","Not by lamentations and mournful chants ought we to celebrate the funeral of a good man, but by hymns, for in ceasing to be numbered with mortals he enters upon the heritage of a diviner life.","Thrasyllus the Cynic begged a drachm of Antigonus. \\"That,\\" said he, \\"is too little for a king to give.\\" \\"Why, then,\\" said the other, \\"give me a talent.\\" \\"And that,\\" said he, \\"is too much for a Cynic (or, for a dog) to receive.\\"","A Spartan woman, as she handed her son his shield, exhorted him saying, \\"As a warrior of Sparta come back with your shield or on it.\\"","The most glorious exploits do not always furnish us with the clearest discoveries of virtue or vice in men.","When Darius offered him ten thousand talents, and to divide Asia equally with him, \\"I would accept it,\\" said Parmenio, \\"were I Alexander.\\" \\"And so truly would I,\\" said Alexander, \\"if I were Parmenio.\\" But he answered Darius that the earth could not bear two suns, nor Asia two kings.","If any man think it a small matter, or of mean concernment, to bridle his tongue, he is much mistaken; for it is a point to be silent when occasion requires, and better than to speak, though never so well.","A soldier told Pelopidas, \\"We are fallen among the enemies.\\" Said he, \\"How are we fallen among them more than they among us?\\"","It is no flattery to give a friend a due character; for commendation is as much the duty of a friend as reprehension.","Scilurus on his death-bed, being about to leave four-score sons surviving, offered a bundle of darts to each of them, and bade them break them.

Is it that the winds, slipping the smooth oil, have no force, nor cause any waves?","They are wrong who think that politics is like an ocean voyage or a military campaign, something to be done with some particular end in view, something which leaves off as soon as that end is reached. It is not a public chore, to be got over with. It is a way of life. It is the life of a domesticated political and social creature who is born with a love for public life, with a desire for honor, with a feeling for his fellows; and it lasts as long as need be.","Whenever Alexander heard Philip had taken any town of importance, or won any signal victory, instead of rejoicing at it altogether, he would tell his companions that his father would anticipate everything, and leave him and them no opportunities of performing great and illustrious actions.","So also it is good not always to make a friend of the person who is expert in twining himself around us; but, after testing them, to attach ourselves to those who are worthy of our affection and likely to be serviceable to us.","Real excellence, indeed, is most recognized when most openly looked into.","Pythias once, scoffing at Demosthenes, said that his arguments smelt of the lamp.","When I myself had twice or thrice made a resolute resistance unto anger, the like befell me that did the Thebans; who, having once foiled the Lacedaemonians (who before that time had held themselves invincible), never after lost so much as one battle which they fought against them.","Come back with your shield - or on it","Pompey had fought brilliantly and in the end routed Caesar\'s whole force... but either he was unable to or else he feared to push on.

The prayer was no sooner made, than shame and respect for their king checked many; the fears of the fugitives changed suddenly into confidence.","He who least likes courting favour, ought also least to think of resenting neglect; to feel wounded at being refused a distinction can only arise from an overweening appetite to have it.","The mind is not a vessel to be filled, but a fire to be kindled.","A human body in no way resembles those that were born for ravenousness; it hath no hawk\u2019s bill, no sharp talon, no roughness of teeth, no such strength of stomach or heat of digestion, as can be sufficient to convert or alter such heavy and fleshy fare. But if you will contend that you were born to an inclination to such food as you have now a mind to eat, do you then yourself kill what you would eat. But do it yourself, without the help of a chopping-knife, mallet or axe, as wolves, bears, and lions do, who kill and eat at once. Rend an ox with thy teeth, worry a hog with thy mouth, tear a lamb or a hare in pieces, and fall on and eat it alive as they do. But if thou had rather stay until what thou eat is to become dead, and if thou art loath to force a soul out of its body, why then dost thou against nature eat an animate thing? There is nobody that is willing to eat even a lifeless and a dead thing even as it is; so they boil it, and roast it, and alter it by fire and medicines, as it were, changing and quenching the slaughtered gore with thousands of sweet sauces, that the palate being thereby deceived may admit of such uncouth fare.","When Alexander saw the breadth of his domain, he wept for there were no more worlds to conquer. (Technically a misquote, but I like the misquote better)","Adversity is the only balance to weigh friends.","Can you really ask what reason Pythagoras had for abstaining from flesh? For my part I rather wonder both by what accident and in what state of soul or mind the first man did so, touched his mouth to gore and brought his lips to the flesh of a dead creature, he who set forth tables of dead, stale bodies and ventured to call food and nourishment the parts that had a little before bellowed and cried, moved and lived. How could his eyes endure the slaughter when throats were slit and hides flayed and limbs torn from limb? How could his nose endure the stench? How was it that the pollution did not turn away his taste, which made contact with the sores of others and sucked juices and serums from mortal wounds? \u2026 It is certainly not lions and wolves that we eat out of self-defense; on the contrary, we ignore these and slaughter harmless, tame creatures without stings or teeth to harm us, creatures that, I swear, Nature appears to have produced for the sake of their beauty and grace. But nothing abashed us, not the flower-like tinting of the flesh, not the persuasiveness of the harmonious voice, not the cleanliness of their habits or the unusual intelligence that may be found in the poor wretches. No, for the sake of a little flesh we deprive them of sun, of light, of the duration of life to which they are entitled by birth and being.","To be ignorant of the lives of the most celebrated men of antiquity is to continue in a state of childhood all our days","It is certainly desirable to be well descended, but the glory belongs to our ancestors.","The Spartans do not ask how many are the enemy but where are they.","Many things which cannot be overcome when they are together yieldthemselves up when taken little by little.","In a certain faraway land the cold is so intense that words freeze as soon as they are uttered, and after some time then thaw and become audible so that words spoken in winter go unheard until the next summer.","Painting is silent poetry,and poetry is painting that speaks.","The fact is that men who know nothing of decency in their own lives are only too ready to launch foul slanders against their betters and to offer them up as victims to the evil deity of popular envy.","A mind is not a vessel to be filled, but a fire to be lighted.","No necesito amigos que cambien cuando yo cambio y asientan cuando yo asiento. Mi sombra lo hace mucho mejor.","I, for my part, wonder of what sort of feeling, mind or reason that man was possessed who was first to pollute his mouth with gore, and to allow his lips to touch the flesh of a murdered being: who spread his table with the mangled forms of dead bodies, and claimed as daily food and dainty dishes what but now were beings endowed with movement, perception and with voice.\u2026but for the sake of some little mouthful of flesh, we deprive a soul of the sun and light, and of that portion of life and time it had been born in to the world to enjoy.","And the most glorious exploits do not always furnish us with the clearest discoveries of virtue or vice in men; sometimes a matter of less moment, an expression or a jest, informs us better of their characters and inclinations, than the most famous sieges, the greatest armaments, or the bloodiest battles whatsoever. Therefore as portrait-painters are more exact in the lines and features of the face, in which the character is seen, than in the other parts of the body, so I must be allowed to give my more particular attention to the marks and indications of the souls of men, and while I endeavor by these to portray their lives, may be free to leave more weighty matters and great battles to be treated of by others.","[Theseus] soon found himself involved in factions and troubles; those who long had hated him had now added to their hatred contempt; and the minds of the people were so generally corrupted, that, instead of obeying commands with silence, they expected to be flattered into their duty.","When someone blamed Hecataeus the sophist because that, being invited to the public table, he had not spoken one word all supper-time, Archidamidas answered in his vindication \'He who knows how to speak, knows also when\'.","When asked by a woman from Attica:\'Why are you Spartan women the only ones who can rule men?\', she said: \'Because we are the only ones who give birth to men.","Good fortune will elevate even petty minds, and gives them the appearance of a certain greatness and stateliness, as from their high place they look down upon the world; but the truly noble and resolved spirit raises itself, and becomes more conspicuous in times of disaster and ill fortune...","For there is no virtue, the honor and credit for which procures a man more odium than that of justice; and this, because more than any other, it acquires a man power and authority among the common people.","The future bears down upon each one of us with all the hazards of the unknown. The only way out is through.","So inconsiderable a thing is fortune in respect of human nature, and so insufficient to give content to a covetous mind, that an empire of that mighty extent and sway could not satisfy the ambition of two men;","take care, in reading the writings of philosophers or hearing their speeches, that you do not attend to words more than things, nor get attracted more by what is difficult and curious than by what is serviceable and solid and useful.","C\xe6sar\xa0once, seeing some wealthy strangers at Rome, carrying up and down with them in their arms and bosoms young puppy-dogs and monkeys, embracing and making much of them, took occasion not unnaturally to ask whether the women in their country were not used to bear children; by that prince-like reprimand gravely reflecting upon persons who spend and lavish upon brute beasts that affection and kindness which nature has implanted in us to be bestowed on those of our own kind. With like reason may we blame those who misuse that love of inquiry and observation which nature has implanted in our souls, by expending it on objects unworthy of the attention either of their eyes or their ears, while they disregard such as are excellent in themselves, and would do them good.","In Springtime, O Dionysos,To thy holy temple come,To Elis with thy Graces,Rushing with thy bull-foot, come,Noble Bull, Noble Bull","For though all persons are equally subject to the caprice of fortune, yet all good men have one advantage she cannot deny, which is this, to act reasonably under misfortunes.","And, to say truly, the greatest benefit that learning bringeth unto men is this: that it teacheth men that be rough and rude of nature, by compass and rule of reason, to be civil and courteous, and to like better the mean state than the higher.","It\u2019s a thing of no great difficulty to raise objections against another man\u2019s oration, it is a very easy matter; but to produce a better in its place is a work extremely troublesome.","when he was \xe6dile, he provided such a number of gladiators, that he entertained the people with three hundred and twenty single combats, and by his great liberality and magnificence in theatrical shows, in processions, and public feastings, he threw into the shade all the attempts that had been made before him, and gained so much upon the people, that every one was eager to find out new offices and new honors for him in return for his munificence.","It was natural for [Spartan women] to think and speak as Gorgo, the wife of Leonidas, is said to have done, when some foreign lady, as it would seem, told her that the women of Lacedaemon were the only women of the world who could rule men; \'With good reason,\' she said, \'for we are the only women who bring forth men\'.","Sertorius rose up and spoke to his army, \u201cYou see, fellow soldiers, that perseverance is more prevailing than violence, and that many things which cannot be overcome when they are together, yield themselves up when taken little by little. Assiduity and persistence are irresistible, and in time overthrow and destroy the greatest powers whatever. Time being the favorable friend and assistant of those who use their judgment to await his occasions, and the destructive enemy of those who are unseasonably urging and pressing forward.","To make an action honorable, it ought to be agreeable to the age, and other circumstances of the person; since it is circumstance and proper measure that give an action its character, and make it either good or bad.","The truly pious must negotiate a difficult course between the precipice of godlessness and the marsh of superstition.","... man by nature is not a wild or unsocial creature, neither was he born so, but makes himself what he naturally is not, by vicious habit; and that again on the other side, he is civilized and grows gentle by a change of place, occupation, and manner of life, as beasts themselves that are wild by nature, become tame and tractable by housing and gentler usage...","if the \u201cKnow thyself of the oracle were an easy thing for every man, it would not be held to be a divine injunction.\u201d","Come and take them","Such contentedness and change of view in regard to every kind of life does the infusion of reason bring about. When Alexander heard from Anaxarchus of the infinite number of worlds, he wept, and when his friends asked him what was the matter, he replied, \\"Is it not a matter for tears that, when the number of worlds is infinite, I have not conquered one?","These things sensibly affected Theseus, who, thinking it but just not to disregard, but rather partake of, the sufferings of his fellow citizens, offered himself for one without any lot. All else were struck with admiration for the nobleness and with love for the goodness of the act.","For dealing with blessings which come to us from outside we need a firm foundation based on reason and education; without this foundation, people keep on seeking these blessings and heaping them up but can never satisfy the insatiable appetites of their souls.","[The Spartans] ordered the maidens to exercise themselves with wrestling, running, throwing the quoit, and casting the dart, to the end that the fruit they conceived might, in strong and healthy bodies, take firmer root and find better growth, and withal that they, with this greater vigour, might be the more able to undergo the pains of childbearing.","Education is not the filling of a pail, but the lighting of a fire. \u201cFor the mind does not require filling like a bottle, but rather, like wood, it only requires kindling to create in it an impulse to think independently and an ardent desire for the truth.","For as we would wish that a painter who is to draw a beautiful face, in which there is yet some imperfection, should neither wholly leave out, nor yet too pointedly express what is defective, because this would deform it, and that spoil the resemblance; so since it is hard, or indeed perhaps impossible, to show the life of a man wholly free from blemish, in all that is excellent we must follow truth exactly, and give it fully; any lapses or faults that occur, through human passions or political necessities, we may regard rather as the shortcomings of some particular virtue, than as the natural effects of vice; and may be content without introducing them, curiously and officiously, into our narrative, if it be but out of tenderness to the weakness of nature, which has never succeeded in producing any human character so perfect in virtue as to be pure from all admixture and open to no criticism.","[It was] better to set up a monarchy themselves than to suffer a sedition to continue that must certainly end in one.","In this city [Tingis] the Libyans say that Antaeus is buried; and Sertorius had his tomb dug open, the great size of which made him disbelieve the Barbarians. But when he came upon the body and found it to be sixty cubits long, as they tell us, he was dumbfounded, and after performing a sacrifice filled up the tomb again, and joined in magnifying its traditions and honours. Now, the people of Tingis have a myth that after the death of Antaeus, his wife, Tinga, consorted with Heracles, and that Sophax was the fruit of this union, who became king of the country and named a city which he founded after his mother; also that Sophax had a son, Diodorus, to whom many of the Libyan peoples became subject, since he had a Greek army composed of the Olbians and Mycenaeans who were settled in those parts by Heracles. But this tale must be ascribed to a desire to gratify Juba, of all kings the most devoted to historical enquiry; for his ancestors are said to have been descendants of Sophax and Diodorus. [The Life of Sertorius]","C\xe6sar is said to have been admirably fitted by nature to make a great statesman and orator, and to have taken such pains to improve his genius this way, that without dispute he might challenge the second place. More he did not aim at, as choosing to be first rather amongst men of arms and power, and, therefore, never rose to that height of eloquence to which nature would have carried him, his attention being diverted to those expeditions and designs, which at length gained him the empire. And he himself, in his answer to Cicero\u2019s panegyric on Cato, desires his reader not to compare the plain discourse of a soldier with the harangues of an orator who had not only fine parts, but had employed his life in this study.","But virtue, by the bare statement of its actions, can so affect men\'s minds as to create at once both admiration of the things done and desire to imitate the doers of them. The goods of fortune we would possess and would enjoy; those of virtue we long to practise and exercise. We are content to receive the former from others, the latter we wish others to experience from us. Moral good is a practical stimulus; it is no sooner seen, than it inspires an impulse to practice, and influences the mind and character not by a mere imitation which we look at, but by the statement of the fact creates a moral purpose which we form.","The whole like of a man is but a point of time; let us enjoy it.","Anaxagoras is said to have predicted that if the heavenly bodies should be loosened by some slip or shake, one of them might be torn away, and might plunge and fall down to earth; and he said that none of the stars was in its original position; for being of stone, and heavy, their shining light is caused by friction with the revolving aether, and they are forced along in fixed orbits by the whirling impulse which gave them their circular motion, and this was what prevented them from falling to our earth in the first place, when cold and heavy bodies were separated from universal matter.","no beast is more savage than man when possessed with power answerable to his rage.","It was not said amiss by Antisthenes, when people told him that one Ismenias was an excellent piper, \u201cIt may be so, said he, \u201cbut he is but a wretched human being, otherwise he would not have been an excellent piper.\u201d And king Philip, to the same purpose, told his son Alexander, who once at a merry-meeting played a piece of music charmingly and skilfully, \u201cAre you not ashamed, son, to play so well?\u201d For it is enough for a king or prince to find leisure sometimes to hear others sing, and he does the muses quite honor enough when he pleases to be but present, while others engage in such exercises and trials of skill. He who busies himself in mean occupations produces, in the very pains he takes about things of little or no use, an evidence against himself of his negligence and indisposition to what is really good.\u201d","They insist upon the shaving of the moustache, I think, in order that they may accustom the young men to obedience in the most trifling matters.","In the midst of this display of statesmanship, eloquence, cleverness, and exalted ambition, Alcibiades live d a life full of prodigious luxury, drunkenness, debauchery, and insolence. He was effeminate in his dress and would walk through the market-place trailing his long purple robes, and he spent extravagantly. He had the decks of his trireme scut away to allow him to sleep more comfortably, and his bedding was slung on cords, rather than spread on the hard planks. He had a golden shield made for him, which was emblazoned not with any ancestral device, but with the figure of Eros armed with a thunderbolt. The leading men of Athens watched all this with disgust and indignation and they were deeply disturbed by his contemptuous and lawless behavior, which seemed to them monstrous and suggested the habits of the tyrant. The people\'s feelings towards him have been very aptly expressed by Aristophanes in the line: \\"They long for him, they hate him, they cannot do without him...\\" The fact was that his voluntary donations, the public shows he supported, his unrivaled munificence to the state, the fame of his ancestry, the power of his oratory and his physical strength and beauty... all combined to make the Athenians forgive him everything else, and they were constantly finding euphemisms for his lapses and putting them down to youthful high spirits and honorable ambition.","I would rather excel in the knowledge of what is excellent than the extent of my power or possessions.","It is no great wonder if in long process of time, while fortune takes her course hither and thither, numerous coincidences should spontaneously occur. If the number and variety of subjects to be wrought upon be infinite, it is all the more easy for fortune, with such an abundance of material, to effect this similarity of results. Or if, on the other hand, events are limited to the combinations of some finite number, then of necessity the same must often recur, and in the same sequence.","Lycurgus was of opinion that ornaments were so far from advantaging them in their counsels, that they were rather an hindrance, by diverting their attention from the business before them to statues and pictures, and roofs curiously fretted, the usual embellishments of such places amongst the other Greeks.","All beyond this is portentous and fabulous, inhabited by poets and mythologers, and there is nothing true or certain.","The malicious humor of men, though perverse and refractory, is not so savage and invincible but it may be wrought upon by kindness, and altered by repeated obligations.","By the aid of philosophy you will live not unpleasantly, for you will learn to extract pleasure from all places and things: wealth will make you happy, because it will enable you to benefit many; and poverty, as you will not then have many anxieties; and glory, for it will make you honoured; and obscurity, for you will then be safe from envy.","Numa forbade the Romans to revere an image of God which had the form of man or beast. Nor was there among them in this earlier time any painted or graven likeness of Deity, 8 but while for the first hundred and seventy years they were continually building temples and establishing sacred shrines, they made no statues in bodily form for them, convinced that it was impious to liken higher things to lower, and that it was impossible to apprehend Deity except by the intellect.","Thus they let their anger and fury take from them the sense of humanity, and demonstrated that no beast is more savage than man when possessed with power answerable to his rage.","For lack of rules (which the undisciplined sector of the young call freedom) sets masters over one which are more tyrannical than the teachers and trainers familiar from childhood \u2013 these masters are the desires, when they have broken out of prison, so to speak.","A Spartan, seeing a man taking up a collection for the gods, said that he did not think much of gods who were poorer than himself.","Being consulted again whether it were requisite to enclose the city with a wall, [Lycurgus] sent them word, \'The city is well fortified which hath a wall of men instead of brick\'.","Demaratus, being asked in a troublesome manner by an importunate fellow, Who was the best man in Lacedaemon? answered at last, \'He, Sir, that is the least like you\'.","\u0414\u0435\u0446\u0430\u0442\u0430 \u0445\u0432\u044a\u0440\u043b\u044f\u0442 \u043a\u0430\u043c\u044a\u043d\u0438 \u043f\u043e \u0436\u0430\u0431\u0438\u0442\u0435 \u0437\u0430\u0440\u0430\u0434\u0438 \u0437\u0430\u0431\u0430\u0432\u043b\u0435\u043d\u0438\u0435\u0442\u043e, \u043d\u043e \u0436\u0430\u0431\u0438\u0442\u0435 \u043d\u0435 \u0443\u043c\u0438\u0440\u0430\u0442 \u043d\u0430\u0443\u0436\u043a\u0438\u043c","For fortune having hitherto seconded him in his designs, made him resolute and firm in his opinions, and the boldness of his temper raised a sort of passion in him for surmounting difficulties; as if it were not enough to be always victorious in the field, unless places and seasons and nature herself submitted to him.","Even so the more a vicious man denies his vice, the more does it insinuate itself and master him: as those people really poor who pretend to be rich get still more poor from their false display.","While in the case of his iron money, as I have explained, Lycurgus arranged for heavy weight to be matched by low value, he did the opposite for the currency of speech. Here he developed the technique of expressing a wide range of ideas in just a few, spare words.","The two armies separated; and we are told that Pyrrhus said to one who was congratulating him on his victory, \u201cIf we are victorious in one more battle with the Romans, we shall be utterly ruined. 10 For he had lost a great part of the forces with which he came, and all his friends and generals except a few; moreover, he had no others whom he could summon from home, and he saw that his allies in Italy were becoming indifferent, while the army of the Romans, as if from a fountain gushing forth indoors, was easily and speedily filled up again, and they did not lose courage in defeat, nay, their wrath gave them all the more vigour and determination for the war.\u201d","Once being hard pressed in wrestling, and fearing to be thrown, he got the hand of his antagonist to his mouth, and bit it with all his force; and when the other loosed his hold presently, and said, \\"You bite, Alcibiades, like a woman.\\" \\"No,\\" replied he, \\"like a lion.\\" Another","You, on the other hand, have often been told that following God and listening to reason are identical; so bear in mind that for intelligent people the passage from childhood to adulthood is not an abandonment of rules, but a change of ruler: instead of someone [E] whose services are hired and bought, they accept in their lives the divine leadership of reason \u2013 and it is only those who follow reason who deserve to be regarded as free. For they alone live as they want, since they have learned to want only what is necessary;","As geographers, Sosius, crowd into the edges of their maps parts of the world which they do not know about, adding notes in the margin to the effect, that beyond this lies nothing but sandy deserts full of wild beasts, unapproachable bogs, Scythian ice, or a frozen sea, so, in this work of mine, in which I have compared the lives of the greatest men with one another, after passing through those periods which probable reasoning can reach to and real history find a footing in, I might very well say of those that are farther off, beyond this there is nothing but prodigies and fictions, the only inhabitants are the poets and inventors of fables; there is no credit, or certainty any farther.","But if any man undertake to write a history, that has to be collected from materials gathered by observation and the reading of works not easy to be got in all places, nor written always in his own language, but many of them foreign and dispersed in other hands, for him, undoubtedly, it is in the first place and above all things most necessary, to reside in some city of good note, addicted to liberal arts, and populous; where he may have plenty of all sorts of books, and upon inquiry may hear and inform himself of such particulars as, having escaped the pens of writers, are more faithfully preserved in the memories of men, lest his work be deficient in many things, even those which it can least dispense with.","Cicero was the first who had any suspicions of his designs upon the government, and, as a good pilot is apprehensive of a storm when the sea is most smiling, saw the designing temper of the man through this disguise of good-humor and affability, and said, that in general, in all he did and undertook, he detected the ambition for absolute power, \u201cbut when I see his hair so carefully arranged, and observe him adjusting it with one finger, I cannot imagine it should enter into such a man\u2019s thoughts to subvert the Roman state.","So it happens in political affairs; if the motions of rulers be constantly opposite and cross to the tempers and inclination of the people, they will be resented as arbitrary and harsh; as, on the other side, too much deference, or encouragement, as too often it has been, to popular faults and errors, is full of danger and ruinous consequences.","Antipater, in a letter written upon the death of Aristotle, the philosopher, observes, \\"Amongst his other gifts he had that of persuasiveness\\"; and the absence of this in the character of Marcius made all his great actions and noble qualities unacceptable to those whom they benifited: pride, and self-will, the consort, as Plato calls it, of solitude, made him insufferable. With the skill which Alcibiades, on the contrary, possessed to treat every one in the way most agreeable to him, we cannot wonder that all his successes were attended with the most exuberant favour and honour; his very errors, at time, being accompanied by something of grace and felicity. And so in spite of great and frequent hurt that he had done the city, he was repeatedly appointed to office and command; while Coriolanus stood in vain for a place which his great services had made his due. The one, in spite of the harm he occasioned, could not make himself hated, nor the other, with all the admiration he attracted, succeed in being beloved by his countrymen.","Menestheus, the son of Peteus, grandson of Orneus, and the great-grandson to Erechtheus, the first man that is recorded to have affected popularity and ingratiated himself with the multitude, stirred up and exasperated the most eminent men of the city, who had long borne a secret grudge to Theseus, conceiving that he had robbed them of their several little kingdoms and lordships, and, having pent them all up in one city, was using them as his subjects and slaves. He put also the meaner people into commotion, telling them, that, deluded with a mere dream of liberty, though indeed they were deprived both of that and of their proper homes and religious usages, instead of many good and gracious kings of their own, they had given themselves up to be lorded over by a new-comer and a stranger.","Whereas stories are fit for every place, reach to all persons, serve for all times, teach the living, revive the dead, so far excelling all other books, as it is better to see learning in Noblemen\u2019s lives, than to read it in Philosophers\u2019 writings.","Even those virtues which nature had denied him were imitated by him so successfully that he won more confidence than those who actually possessed them.","\u041f\u043e-\u043c\u0430\u043b\u043a\u043e \u043d\u0443\u0436\u0434\u0438 - \u043f\u043e-\u043c\u0430\u043b\u043a\u043e \u043b\u0438\u0448\u0435\u043d\u0438\u044f.","[The Spartans] should not make war often, or long, with the same enemy, lest that they should train and instruct them in war, by habituating them to defend themselves.","\u0645\u0646 \u0627\u0644\u0646\u0627\u0633 \u0646\u062a\u0639\u0644\u0645 \u0627\u0644\u0643\u0644\u0627\u0645 \u0648\u0645\u0646 \u0627\u0644\u0622\u0644\u0647\u0629 \u0627\u0644\u0635\u0645\u062a","Pile up gold, heap up silver, build covered walks, fill your house with slaves and the town with debtors, unless you lay to rest the passions of the soul, and put a curb on your insatiable desires, and rid yourself of fear and anxiety, you are but pouring out wine for a man in a fever, and giving honey to a man who is bilious, and laying out a sumptuous banquet for people who are suffering from dysentery,","Over time events trickle out of the minds of forgetful, thoughtless people, and so, since they retain and conserve nothing, the empty space within them, that should be filled with good things, is filled instead with hopes, so that they neglect the present and look to the future, despite the fact that fortune may yet foil the future, whereas the present cannot be taken away.","The mind is not a vessel that needs filling, but wood that needs igniting.","At last, he began to discourse of fortune and human affairs. \\"Is it meet,\\" said he, \\"for him that knows he is but man, in his greatest prosperity to pride himself, and be exalted at the conquest of a city, nation, or kingdom, and not rather well to weigh this change of fortune, in which all warriors may see an example of their common frailty, and learn a lesson that there is nothing durable or constant? For what time can men select to think themselves secure, when that of victory itself forces us more than any to dread our own fortune? and a very little consideration on the law of things, and how all are hurried round, and each man\'s station changed, will introduce sadness in the midst of the greatest joy. Or can you, when you see before your eyes the succession of Alexander himself, who arrived at the height of power and ruled the greatest empire, in the short space of an hour trodden underfoot- when you behold a king, that was but even now surrounded with so numerous an army, receiving nourishment to support his life from the hands of his conquerors- can you, I say, believe there is any certainty in what we now possess whilst there is such a thing as chance? No, young men, cast off that vain pride and empty boast of victory; sit down with humility, looking always for what is yet to come, and the possible future reverses which the divine displeasure may eventually make the end of our present happiness.","Whilst he was very young, he was a soldier in the expedition against Potidaea, where Socrates lodged in the same tent with him, and stood next him in battle. Once there happened a sharp skirmish, in which they both behaved with signal bravery; but Alcibiades receiving a wound, Socrates threw himself before him to defend him, and beyond any question saved him and his arms from the enemy, and so in all justice might have challenged the prize of valor. But","That which is chiefly the office of a general, to force the enemy into fighting when he finds himself the stronger, and to avoid being driven into it himself when he is the weaker...","4. So reason makes all sorts of life easy, and every change pleasant. Alexander wept when he heard from Anaxarchus that there was an infinite number of worlds, and his friends asking him if any accident had befallen him, he returns this answer: Do not you think it a matter worthy of lamentation, that, when there is such a vast multitude of them, we have not yet conquered one? But Crates with only his scrip and tattered cloak laughed out his life jocosely, as if he had been always at a festival. The great power and command of Agamemnon gave him an equal disturbance:","Basically, he used to say, the term cheap did not apply to something inessential: even if something cost only an as, you should regard it as something expensive if it was not something you needed- Cato the Elder","Now at the time of which I was speaking, as the voters were inscribing their ostraka [to determine which politician would be expelled from the city], it is said that an unlettered and utterly boorish fellow handed his ostrakon to Aristides, whom he took to be one of the ordinary crowd, and asked him to write Aristides on it. He, astonished, asked the man what possible wrong Aristides had done him. \u201cNone whatever, was the answer, \u201cI don\u2019t even know the fellow, but I am tired of hearing him everywhere called \u2018The Just.\u2019\u200a\u201d On hearing this, Aristides made no answer, but wrote his name on the ostrakon and handed it back.\u201d","page 212:let me be far from the battle at ThermodonWatching if from high in the clouds, like an eagle.The vanquished weep, and the victor has perished.","For there is no virtue, the honour and credit for which procures a man more odium than that of justice; and this, because more than any other, it acquires a man power and authority among the common people. For they only honour the valiant and admire the wise, while in addition they also love just men, and put entire trust and confidence in them. They fear the bold man, and mistrust the clever man, and moreover think them rather beholding to their natural complexion, than to any goodness of their will, for these excellences; they look upon valour as a certain natural strength of the mind, and wisdom as a constitutional acuteness; whereas a man has it in his power to be just, if he have but the will to be so, and therefore injustice is thought the most dishonourable, because it is least excusable.","I don\'t need a friend who change when I change, who nod when I nod. This is something than my own shadow can do.","Small, therefore, can we think the progress we have made, as long as our admiration for those who have done noble things is barren, and does not of itself incite us to imitate them.","\u0413\u043b\u0443\u043f\u0430\u0446\u0438\u0442\u0435 \u043d\u0435 \u0441\u043b\u0443\u0448\u0430\u0442 \u043d\u0438\u043a\u043e\u0433\u043e, \u0430 \u0441\u0430\u043c\u0438\u0442\u0435 \u0442\u0435 \u043d\u0435\u043f\u0440\u0435\u043a\u044a\u0441\u043d\u0430\u0442\u043e \u0433\u043e\u0432\u043e\u0440\u044f\u0442.","\u0417\u0430 \u0434\u0430 \u043f\u043e\u0447\u0443\u0432\u0441\u0442\u0432\u0430\u0442\u0435 \u0446\u0435\u043d\u0430\u0442\u0430 \u043d\u0430 \u0442\u043e\u0432\u0430, \u043a\u043e\u0435\u0442\u043e \u043f\u0440\u0438\u0442\u0435\u0436\u0430\u0432\u0430\u0442\u0435, \u043f\u0440\u0435\u0434\u0441\u0442\u0430\u0432\u0435\u0442\u0435 \u0441\u0438, \u0447\u0435 \u0441\u0442\u0435 \u0433\u043e \u0438\u0437\u0433\u0443\u0431\u0438\u043b\u0438.","And it is said that extraordinary rains generally dash down after great battles, whether it is that some divine power drenches and hallows the ground with purifying waters from Heaven, or that the blood and putrefying matter send up a moist and heavy vapour which condenses the air, this being easily moved and readily changed to the highest degree by the slightest cause.","Being human and investigating the affairs of the gods is an extreme version of being tone-deaf and talking about music, or having never served in the army and talking about warfare: we resemble amateurs trying to use arguments from probability based on opinions and conjecture to unearth the ideas of experts.

It is possible, too, that in such cases there is a whirling motion of the air, which becomes like a waterspout at sea with a refluent flow of the surges caused by their very volume.","For her beauty, as we are told, was in itself not altogether incomparable, nor such as to strike those who saw her; but converse with her had an irresistible charm, and her presence, combined with the persuasiveness of her discourse and the character which was somehow diffused about her behaviour towards others, had something stimulating about it. 3 There was sweetness also in the tones of her voice; and her tongue, like an instrument of many strings, she could readily turn to whatever language she pleased, so that in her interviews with Barbarians she very seldom had need of an interpreter, but made her replies to most of them herself and unassisted, whether they were Ethiopians, Troglodytes, Hebrews, Arabians, Syrians, Medes or Parthians. 4 Nay, it is said that she knew the speech of many other peoples also, although the kings of Egypt before her had not even made an effort to learn the native language, and some actually gave up their Macedonian dialect.","The mind is not a vessel that needs filling, but wood that needs kindling.","\u041f\u0440\u0435\u0434\u0430\u0442\u0435\u043b\u044f\u0442 \u043f\u0440\u0435\u0434\u0430\u0432\u0430 \u043f\u0440\u0435\u0434\u0438 \u0432\u0441\u0438\u0447\u043a\u043e \u0441\u0435\u0431\u0435 \u0441\u0438.","For kings indeed we have, who wear the marks and assume the titles of royalty, but as for the qualities of their minds, they have nothing by which they are to be distinguished from their subjects.","In fact Cleopatra was indebted to Fulvia for teaching Antony to obey a wife\'s authority, for by the time he met her he had already been quite broken in and schooled to accept the way of women.","...\u0421\u0438\u043b\u0430\u0442\u0430 \u043d\u0430 \u0441\u043b\u043e\u0432\u043e\u0442\u043e \u0441\u0435 \u0441\u044a\u0441\u0442\u043e\u0438 \u0432 \u0443\u043c\u0435\u043d\u0438\u0435\u0442\u043e \u0434\u0430 \u0441\u0435 \u0438\u0437\u0440\u0430\u0437\u0438 \u043c\u043d\u043e\u0433\u043e \u0441 \u043c\u0430\u043b\u043a\u043e \u0434\u0443\u043c\u0438.","\u0418\u043b\u0438 \u043a\u043e\u043b\u043a\u043e\u0442\u043e \u043c\u043e\u0436\u0435 \u043f\u043e-\u043a\u0440\u0430\u0442\u043a\u043e, \u0438\u043b\u0438 \u043a\u043e\u043b\u043a\u043e\u0442\u043e \u043c\u043e\u0436\u0435 \u043f\u043e-\u043f\u0440\u0438\u044f\u0442\u043d\u043e.","It was for the most part by sacrifices, processions, and religious dances, which he himself appointed and conducted, and which mingled with their solemnity a diversion full of charm and a beneficent pleasure, that he won the people\u2019s favour and tamed their fierce and warlike tempers. At times, also, by heralding to them vague terrors from the god, strange apparitions of divine beings and threatening voices, he would subdue and humble their minds by means of superstitious fears.","To seek power by servility to the people is a disgrace, but to maintain it by terror, violence, and oppression is not a disgrace only, but an injustice.","When someone asked Demaratus why the Spartans disgrace those who throw away their shields but not those who abandon their breastplates or helmets, he said that they put the latter on for their own sakes but the shield for the sake of the whole line.","So they cut their hair short in front, that their enemies might not grasp it. And they say that Alexander of Macedon for the same reason ordered his generals to have the beards of the Macedonians shaved, because they were a convenient handle for the enemy to grasp.","It was a pleasure merely to hear the sound of her voice, with which, like an instrument of many strings, she could pass from one language to another; so that there were few of the barbarian nations that she answered by an interpreter.","They should live all together on an equal footing; merit to be their only road to eminence, and the disgrace of evil, and credit of worthy acts, their one measure of difference between man and man.","Nor had the cities of Sicily any trust in him, as they were in great distress, and greatly exasperated against those who pretended to lead armies to their succour, on account of the treachery of Kallippus and Pharax; who, one an Athenian and the other a Lacedaemonian, but both giving out that they were come to fight for freedom and to put down despotism, did so tyrannise themselves, that the reign of the despots in Sicily seemed to have been a golden age, and those who died in slavery were thought more happy than those who lived to see liberty.","In an harangue to the people, he said, with reference to these measures, that he had proscribed all he could think of, and as to those who now escaped his memory, he would proscribe them at some future time.","In a harangue to the people, he said, with reference to these measures, that he had proscribed all he could think of, and as to those who now escaped his memory, he would proscribe them at some future time.","A man must have a less than ordinary share of sense that would furnish such plain and common rooms with silver-footed couches and purple coverlets and gold and silver plate.","For humans it is not at all possible to have the best thing of all or to have any share of the best nature\u2014since the best thing for all men and women is not to be born. But the second best thing after this and the first available to mortals, is to die as soon as possible after being born.

Wherefore sooner will an empty ship in a storm at sea admit of a pilot from without, than a man tossed with anger and rage listen to the advice of another, unless he have his own reason first prepared to entertain it.","Those who receive with most pains and difficulty, remember best; every new think they learn, being, as it were, burnt and branded in on their minds.","Friends and kindred should be the good and virtuous [of all mankind], and that the vicious only should be accounted foreigners. Nor ... Greeks and barbarians should be distinguished by long garments, targets, scimitars, or turbans; but that the Grecians should be known by their virtue and courage, and the barbarians by their vices and their cowardice.","Thus it is that most people seem to suffer more from hard words than hard deeds, and are more excited by insult than by actual hurt. What we do to our enemies in war is done of necessity, but the evil we say of them seems to spring from an excess of spite.","A human body in no way resembles those that were born for ravenousness; it hath no hawk\u2019s bill, no sharp talon, no roughness of teeth, no such strength of stomach or heat of digestion, as can be sufficient to convert or alter such heavy and fleshy fare.","In der Nacht waren sie der Gegenstand seiner Tr\xe4ume, und w\xe4hrend des Tages trieb ihn der Eifer, seinem Vorbild \xe4hnlich zu werden, hinaus und stachelte ihn zu dem Vorsatz an, die gleichen Taten zu verrichten.","And he used to say that sleep and sexual intercourse, more than any thing else, made him conscious that he was mortal, implying that both weariness and pleasure arise from one and the same natural weakness.","in which he reigned; a certain writer called Clodius, in a book","unrestricted","Lycurgus did not regard sons as the peculiar property of their fathers, but rather as the common property of the state,","After giving marriage such traits of reserve and decorum, he none the less freed men from the empty and womanish passion of jealous possession, by making it honourable for them, while keeping the marriage relation free from all wanton irregularities, to share with other worthy men in the begetting of children,","So reason makes all sorts of life easy, and every change pleasant. Alexander wept when he heard from Anaxarchus that there was an infinite number of worlds, and his friends asking him if any accident had befallen him, he returns this answer: Do not you think it a matter worthy of lamentation, that, when there is such a vast multitude of them, we have not yet conquered one? But Crates with only his scrip and tattered cloak laughed out his life jocosely, as if he had been always at a festival.","Men, whither is your course taking you, who give all possible attention to the acquiring of money but give small thought to your sons to whom ye are to leave it?","it is useful, or rather it is necessary, not to be indifferent about acquiring the works of earlier writers, but to make a collection of these, like a set of tools in farming. For the corresponding tool of education is the use of books, and by their means it has come to pass that we are able to study knowledge at its source.","Thereupon many statesmen and philosophers came to Alexander with their congratulations, and he expected that Diogenes of Sinope also, who was tarrying in Corinth, would do likewise. But since that philosopher took not the slightest notice of Alexander, and continued to enjoy his leisure in the suburb Craneion, Alexander went in person to see him; and he found him lying in the sun. Diogenes raised himself up a little when he saw so many people coming towards him, and fixed his eyes upon Alexander. And when that monarch addressed him with greetings, and asked if he wanted anything, \\"Yes,\\" said Diogenes, \\"stand a little out of my sun.\\" It is said that Alexander was so struck by this, and admired so much the haughtiness and grandeur of the man who had nothing but scorn for him, that he said to his followers, who were laughing and jesting about the philosopher as they went away, \\"But truly, if I were not Alexander, I wish I were Diogenes.","But more than this - not even, after your victims have been killed, will you eat them just as they are from the slaughter-house. You boil, roast, and altogether metamorphose them by fire and condiments. You entirely alter and disguise the murdered animal by use of ten thousand sweet herbs and spices, that your natural taste may be deceived and be prepared to take the unnatural food. A proper and witty rebuke was that of the Spartan who bought a fish and gave it to his cook to dress. When the latter asked for butter, and olive oil, and vinegar, he replied, \'Why, if I had all these things I should not have bought the fish!","Lycurgus, who ordered that a great piece of money should be but of an inconsiderable value, on the contrary would allow no discourse to be current which did not contain in few words a great deal of useful and curious sense.","Under him everything was done with both zeal and skill. He neglected all other duties, when engaged upon these, neither omitting any part nor adding any, arguing with his companions, when they blamed him for his care about trifles, that though a man might think that heaven was merciful and forgiving of negligences, yet that habitual disregard and overlooking of such points was dangerous for the state, seeing that no one ever begins till some flagrant breach of the law to disturb the constitution, but those who are careless of accuracy in small things soon begin to neglect the most important.","Nevertheless, it is said that the people of Massalia fenced their vineyards round with the bones of the fallen, and that the soil, after the bodies had wasted away in it and the rains had fallen all winter upon it, grew so rich and became so full to its depths of the putrefied matter that sank into it, that it produced an exceeding great harvest in after years, and confirmed the saying of Archilochus\u200b that \\"fields are fattened\\" by such a process.","All men, while they are awake, are in one common world; but each of them, when he is asleep, is in a world of his own.","Both stand charged with the rape of women; neither of them could avoid domestic misfortunes nor jealousy at home; but towards the close of their lives are both of them said to have incurred great odium with their countrymen, if, that is, we may take the stories least like poetry as our guide to the truth.","Whenever two notes are sounded in accord the tune is carried by the bass; and in like manner every activity in a virtuous household is carried on by both parties in agreement, but discloses the husband\u2019s leadership and preferences.","As he spoke, he opened his clothes, and showed his breast with an incredible number of scars upon it; then turning to Galba, who had made some remarks not very decent \\"You laugh,\\" said he, \\"at these other marks: but I glory in them before my countrymen, for I got them by riding, night and day, in their service. But come, bring them to vote; I will go amongst them and follow them all to the poll, that I may know those who are cowardly and ungrateful, and like rather to be ruled by a demagogue than by a true general.","Ciascuna per la sua bellezza allora era immediatamente antica, oggi, dopo molto tempo, \xe8 recente, nuova e rigogliosa. Sulle opere di Pericle fiorisce come una giovinezza perenne, esse si conservano allo sguardo indenni nel tempo, quasi posseggano infuso un respiro sempre fresco e un\'anima che non conosce vecchiezza.","There is a story recorded about Geradas, a Spartiate of really ancient times, who when asked by a foreigner what their punishment for adulterers was, said: \\"There is no adulterer among us, stranger.\\" When the latter replied: \\"But what if there should be one?\\", Geradas\' answer was: \\"His fine would be a great bull which bends over Mount Taygetus to Drink from the Eurotas.\\" The foreigner was amazed at this and said: \\"But how could there be a bull of such size?\\" At which Geradas laughed and said: \\"But how could there be an adulterer at Sparta?\\" This, then, concludes my investigation of their marriages.","For they either believe their colleagues to be their equals and so they fight against them; or they believe them to be superior and so they envy them; or they believe them inferior and so they despise them. We must, however, pay court to the colleague who is superior, make the inferior better, and honor the equal.","This vexed Theseus, and determining not to hold aloof, but to share the fortunes of the people, he came forward and offered himself without being drawn by lot. The people all admired his courage and patriotism, and Aegeus finding that his prayers and entreaties had no effect on his unalterable resolution, proceeded to choose the rest by lot.","With full knowledge and understanding they themselves offered up their own children, and those who had no children would buy little ones from poor people and cut their throats as if they were so many lambs or young birds; meanwhile the mother stood by without a tear or moan; but should she utter a single moan or let fall a single tear, she had to forfeit the money, and her child was sacrificed nevertheless; and the whole area before the statue was filled with a loud noise of flutes and drums took the cries of wailing should not reach the ears of the people.","So is it with women also; if they subordinate themselves to their husbands, they are commended, but if they want to have control, they cut a sorrier figure than the subjects of their control. And control ought to be exercised by the man over the woman, not as the owner has control over a piece of property, but, as the soul colonists the body, by entering into her feelings and being knit to her through goodwill. As, therefore, it is possible to exercise care over the body without being a slave to its pleasures and desires, so it is possible to govern a wife, and at the same time to delight and gratify her.","We ought indeed to shrink from and feel shame at what is base; but the nature which is over-cautious to avoid blame may be gentle and kindly, but cannot be great.","But it seems to have eluded all these philosophers in what way each of us is truly two fold and composite. For that other two fold nature of ours they have not discerned, but merely the more obvious one, the blend of soul and body. But that there is some element of composition, some two fold nature and dissimilarity of the very soul within itself, since the irrational, as though it were another substance, is mingled and joined with reason by some compulsion of Nature \u2014 E this, it is likely, was not unknown even to Pythagoras, if we may judge by the man\u2019s enthusiasm for the study of music, which he introduced to enchant and assuage the soul, perceiving that the soul has not every part of itself in subjection to discipline and study, and that not every part can be changed from vice by reason, but that the several parts have need of some other kind of persuasion to co operate with them, to mould them, and to tame them, if they are not to be utterly intractable and obstinate to the teaching of philosophy.","Another Spartan, when he saw men sitting on stools in a lavatory, declared: \\"May I never sit where it is impossible for me to get up and offer my seat to an older man.","\xc1ltal\xe1ban \xfagy van az, a f\xe1rads\xe1gos munk\xe1t is k\xf6nnyebben elviselj\xfck, ha valaki szemmel l\xe1that\xf3an azon igyekszik, hogy megossza vel\xfcnk: \xedgy a munk\xe1t nem \xe9rezz\xfck re\xe1nk k\xe9nyszer\xedtett f\xe1radts\xe1gnak.

For what did it achieve? If the assassins had really wanted to quash the rise of one-man rule in Rome, if they wanted to kill the tyranny as well as the tyrant, they were strikingly unsuccessful.","For if they do not receive the seed of good doctrines and share with their husbands in intellectual advancement, they, left to themselves, conceive many untoward ideas and low designs and emotions.","The art of wise administration consist in making certain concessions and granting that which will please the people, while demanding in return an obedience and cooperation which will benefit the whole community. p235-236","\u041b\u0438\u043f\u0441\u0430\u0442\u0430 \u043d\u0430 \u043c\u044f\u0440\u043a\u0430 \u0435 \u043e\u043f\u0430\u0441\u043d\u0430 \u0432\u044a\u0432 \u0432\u0441\u044f\u043a\u0430 \u043e\u0431\u043b\u0430\u0441\u0442, \u043d\u043e \u0432 \u043f\u043e\u043b\u0438\u0442\u0438\u0447\u0435\u0441\u043a\u0430\u0442\u0430 \u043a\u0430\u0440\u0438\u0435\u0440\u0430\u0435 \u043d\u0430\u043f\u0440\u0430\u0432\u043e \u043f\u0430\u0433\u0443\u0431\u043d\u0430. \u0422\u044f \u0432\u043e\u0434\u0438 \u0434\u043e \u044f\u0432\u043d\u0430 \u043b\u0443\u0434\u043e\u0441\u0442 \u0438 \u0431\u0435\u0437\u0443\u043c\u0438\u0435 \u0445\u043e\u0440\u0430\u0442\u0430, \u043e\u0431\u043b\u0435\u0447\u0435\u043d\u0438 \u0432 \u0433\u043e\u043b\u044f\u043c\u0430\u0432\u043b\u0430\u0441\u0442, \u043a\u043e\u0433\u0430\u0442\u043e \u0442\u0435 \u0441\u0435 \u0441\u0442\u0440\u0435\u043c\u044f\u0442 \u043d\u0435 \u0434\u0430 \u043f\u0440\u043e\u0441\u043b\u0430\u0432\u044f\u0442 \u0434\u043e\u0431\u0440\u043e\u0442\u043e, \u043d\u043e \u0434\u0430 \u0441\u043c\u044f\u0442\u0430\u0442 \u0441\u043b\u0430\u0432\u0430\u0442\u0430 \u0437\u0430 \u0434\u043e\u0431\u0440\u043e","And yet, said he, \u201chow can a man take care of his own horse or furbish up his spear and helmet, if he is unaccustomed to using his hands on his own dear person?

And Zeno, on learning that the ship which bore his venture had been wrecked, exclaimed, \u201cA real kindness, O Fortune, that thou, too, dost join in driving us to the philosopher\u2019s cloak!","That age produced a sort of men, in force of hand, and swiftness of foot, and strength of body, excelling the ordinary rate, and wholly incapable of fatigue; making use, however, of these gifts of nature to no good or profitable purpose for mankind, but rejoicing and priding themselves in insolence, and taking the benefit of their superior strength in the exercise of inhumanity and cruelty, and in seizing, forcing, and committing all manner of outrages upon everything that fell into their hands; all respect for others, all justice, they thought, all equity and humanity, though naturally lauded by common people, either out of want of courage to commit injuries or fear to receive them, yet no way concerned those who were strong enough to win for themselves.","It is certainly our duty to avoid all appearance of evil, and to be ashamed to give occasion even to be reputed vicious; yet evil reports are so inconsiderable to a wise man, that, if he have a greater aversion to the nature of evil than to the infamy that attends it, he will not fear what is said of him abroad, nor what calumnies are raised, if so be he be made the better by them. It was handsomely said of Diogenes, when he saw a young spark coming out of a tavern, who at the sight of him drew back: Do not retire, says he, for the more you go backward, the more you will be in the tavern. Even so every vicious person, the more he denies and palliates vice, the more aggravates and confirms it, and with surer footing goes farther into wickedness; like some persons of ordinary rank and quality, who, while they assume above themselves, and out of arrogance would be thought rich, are made really poor and necessitous, by pretending to be otherwise.","common people, who, in any difficult crisis and great exigency, ever look for relief rather to strange and extravagant than to reasonable means,","[Apollo], whose oracle is in Delphi, neither speaks nor suppresses, but indicates.","For the first step towards victory undoubtedly is to gain courage.","Foolish people practice politics, not by serving as generals, secretaries, or popular leaders, but by inciting the mob, giving public speeches, fostering discord, or performing public service out of obligation; and, conversely, those who are civic-minded, philanthropic, devoted to the city, attentive, and truly political are always practicing politics by the promotion of those in power, the guidance of those needing direction, the support of those deliberating, the correction of those causing harm, and the reinforcement of those who are sensible.","When therefore we once begin so to love good men, as not only (according to Plato) to esteem the wise man himself happy, and him who hears his discourses sharer in his felicity, but also to admire and love his habit, gait, look, and very smile, so as to wish ourselves to be that very person, then we may be assured that we have made very good proficiency."]')}}]);
