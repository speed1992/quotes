I am not the outcome. I am never the result.

Always does.","So I ask myself the question, \\"if I loved myself, truly and deeply, what would I do?\\"\xa0 I love this question.\xa0 There is no threat, no right or wrong answer, only an invitation to my truth in this present moment.","The key, at least for me, has been to let go. \xa0Let go of the ego, let go of attachments, let go of who I think I should be, who others think I should be.","Often, the price for not being present is pain.

It only exhausts you. Close your eyes. Lean into the currents, say yes. Let the wind raise you higher and higher. So easy. That\'s what Eagles do. Oh, this is the secret to life as well.","Once you cross the threshold, you will never be the same. That is a fact.","Creating anything that never existed before is not sanity.","Threshold is where the madness ends and the magic begins.","It is the biggest public service one can do \u2014 show others exactly how to transform themselves, make their lives better. Because when we are better, those around us are better. Ripple effects, far greater than we can foresee.","Whatever you experience in your life, choose for it to make you grow in amazing and unbelievable ways. You owe it to yourself. You owe it to those who came before you. You owe it to those connected to you who you\u2019ll never meet. You owe it to those who have yet to come into your life.","Fear, when used properly, is a useful tool.\xa0 It serves us well when near a blazing inferno or standing at the edge of a cliff.\xa0 But outside of this, it\'s hijacked the mind.\xa0 To the point where it\'s difficult to distinguish the mind and our thoughts from fear itself.","If you think about it, how much time do we spend in our heads wishing things were another way, beating ourselves up, beating others up, crafting a different past, wishing for a different future? All of that is resistance. All of that is pain.","Knowledge is never enough. Even action, if it\'s just following a prescribed way, will never fully express your potential.","I cannot emphasize enough the quality of those you surround yourself with.","I once heard someone explain thoughts as this: we, as human beings, think that we\'re thinking.\xa0 Not true.\xa0 Most of the time, we\'re remembering.\xa0 We\'re re-living memories.\xa0 We\'re running familiar patterns and loops in our head.\xa0 For happiness, for procrastination, for sadness.\xa0 Fears, hopes, dreams, desires.\xa0 We have loops for everything.","Forget demolishing the grooves of the past. What you\'re creating is a new groove so deep, so powerful, that your thoughts will automatically flow down this one.","Resist nothing. Like the Tibetan monk who once told me that he found peace by saying yes to all that happened. I met him again years later and reminded him of what he\u2019d said. He laughed. \u201cPerhaps, he said. \u201cIt does fit with my life philosophy.\u201d He had a lightness to him that is rare. His laugh, genuine. I almost expected him to levitate. If you think about it, how much time do we spend in our heads wishing things were another way, beating ourselves up, beating others up, crafting a different past, wishing for a different future? All of that is resistance. All of that is pain. Peace is letting it be. Letting life flow, letting emotions flow through you. If you don\u2019t fight them, they pass through quickly and you feel better.\u201d","Truth makes you rise to new heights, no matter where you are.","After all, it\'s the things we hold against ourselves that weigh us down more than anything.","Step 5: Repeat \\"I love myself\\" gently, pausing occasionally to watch your eyes. \xa0 When the five minutes are up, smile.\xa0 You\'ve just communicated the truth to yourself in a deep, visceral way.\xa0 In a way the mind cannot escape.\xa0 If anyone ever looked in your eyes, knowing that you loved them, this is what they saw.\xa0 Give yourself the same gift.","As human beings, we crave light. We find sunrises and sunsets and bright moon beautiful and calming.","Surrender means cleaning the window so light can enter.","I breathe slowly, naturally.\xa0 As I inhale, I think, I love myself.\xa0 Then I exhale and let out whatever the response in my mind and body is, whether there is one or not.\xa0 That\'s it.\xa0 Simple.","Fighting fear doesn\'t work.\xa0 It just drags us in closer.\xa0 One has to focus on what is real.\xa0 On the truth.\xa0 When in darkness, don\'t fight it.\xa0 You can\'t win.\xa0 Just find the nearest switch, turn on the light.\xa0 \xa0 James Altucher, in one of his best blog posts, talks about how he stops negative thoughts in their tracks with a simple mind trick.\xa0 \\"Not useful,\\" he tells himself.\xa0 It\'s a switch, a breaker of sorts, shifts the pattern of the fear.","The simple act of putting your truth on paper, only you and your thoughts, is one of the most powerful exercises you can do.","Magic I finish at the gym, walk outside, and sit on a wall by the driveway. \xa0Indian summer evening in San Francisco. \xa0Breezy, cool, fog above downtown. \xa0Delicious. I love my life, I find myself thinking, I love my life, I love my life, I love my life. \xa0The thought flows as naturally as the wind. \xa0I watch the skyline \u2013 people ask why I let my long hair fall in front of my eyes\u2026it\u2019s for moments like these, when I watch the world through wisps of silver \u2013 I love my life, I love my life. Clouds move above, the thought shifts: I love myself, I love myself, I love myself, I love myself. \xa0I\u2019m smiling, then grinning. \xa0All I am, my hopes, dreams, desires, faults,","If ever in pain, I think the best thing we can do is to create something.","instead of reading loads of self-help books, attending various seminars, listening to different preachers, we should just pick one thing.\xa0 Something that feels true for us.\xa0 Then practice it fiercely.","Life is short. Life is long. Life is. It is whatever we wish to make it be. That is the gift. We may fall, veer wildly off course, make mistakes. You know, being human and all. Makes no difference. Desire and commitment are fundamental human qualities as well, available anytime. A reset is as simple as this moment.","Whatever your truth is, live it, share it.\xa0 The world will respond in ways you never could have imagined.\xa0 Life will blow your socks off.","is a strength in this vulnerability that cannot be described, only experienced.","I can\'t erase the past, only learn from it.","And how does one live a fulfilled life? By deciding for themselves what is true \u2014 whether it\u2019s love, faith, commitment to family, a mission, whatever it is \u2014 and then living it. Every person I admire who\u2019s successful and radiates an inner happiness, they are living their truth. It\u2019s that simple. Decide what your truth is. Then live it.","As a wise friend likes to remind me, this is a practice.\xa0 You don\'t go to the gym once and consider yourself done.\xa0 Same here.\xa0 Meditation is a practice.\xa0 Working out is a practice.\xa0 Loving yourself, perhaps the most important of all, is a practice.","As long as it works, it\'s valid.","James Altucher has his daily practice, four buckets to fill: mental, spiritual, physical, emotional. According to him, if you meet those each day, your life will be transformed.","Memory is not set in stone.\xa0 Any neuroscientist will tell you that.\xa0 The more you remember something, especially if it\'s emotionally charged, the more you will reinforce the pathways connecting the neurons.\xa0 Simply put, the more you think about it, the more you feel it, the stronger the memory.","You dive deeper, you strip away the cleverness and the words become more important than your ego and that\'s when you know it\'s real, when it\'s good.","Okay, I say out loud. \u201cIf I loved myself, what would I do?\u201d The monk from Dharamsala flashes by. His smile. \u201cSay yes.\u201d \u201cHey,\u201d I say, then laugh slightly. \u201cTo what, this?\u201d \u201cSay yes.\u201d \u201cIf I loved myself\u2026?\u201d \u201cSay yes.\u201d No\u201d","The key, at least for me, has been to let go. \xa0Let go of the ego, let go of attachments, let go of who I think I should be, who others think I should be. \xa0And as I do that, the real me emerges, far far better than the Kamal I projected to the world.","Often, the price for not being present is pain.","Here I am, fallible, judging another fallible being through the lenses of the past, through fear. I thought I had to forgive my father to be free. Turns out, I had to forgive myself. If you come to it that way, forgiveness for others is not just easy, it\u2019s a way of being.","I think often we try to save the world, to love others, to forgive them. We think it\u2019s others that we need to do something to, something for. The irony is, it\u2019s all a path that ultimately brings us to the one who needs it the most \u2014 ourselves.","Moment to moment to moment. I won\u2019t succeed most of the time, the gravity of the mind is strong, but whenever I remember the truth, I\u2019m creating something beautiful. A moment where I\u2019m present, where I\u2019m loving myself, nourishing myself.","The irony is that by taking care of myself in this moment, I\u2019m creating a beautiful past for myself as the moment has already passed.","If something scares you, there\'s magic on the other side","I can\u2019t remember the last time I saw so many stars. Or heard such silence. But not in my head. The world I left behind just two days ago still bounces around my mind. Lots happened in the past year. Beginnings and endings, opportunities and goodbyes.","There is a rhythm to everything, Musashi wrote. \u201cTo music, battle, even mounting a horse. You cannot ignore it. Rhythm to being in harmony with others, and a rhythm to not being in harmony with them.\u201d","Love, pain, fears, hopes, dreams, desires. All arise from the mind. We\u2019re stuck in our heads, walking around, reliving old stories and patterns and beliefs. The ever constant human drama. I don\u2019t know why our brains are wired that way, they just are.","The secret is this: pick something that is important to you. One thing. Look at your belief on it, what you know to be true. Then, as if diving off a board, your feet already in the air, you commit. Sit down, grab a piece of paper, write down what you want to do or be, a vow to yourself. Go all in. The board is already behind you, gravity has taken over, you\u2019re falling\u2026","This is the simple secret. Pick something you truly want. Commit. Commit on paper. To yourself. Dive in, do the work. You\u2019ll leave the board, falling and falling\u2026until you notice gravity lessen, your rate of descent slowing until it reverses and then\u2026and then, you\u2019re flying.","Do it again and again.\xa0 Love.\xa0 Re-wire.\xa0 Love.\xa0 Re-wire.\xa0 It\'s your mind.\xa0 You can do whatever you want.","The things I carry are my thoughts. That\u2019s it. They are the only weight. My thoughts determine whether I am free and light or burdened. Regardless of whether the world is exploding or celebrating, my inside determines the quality of what I experience outside.","We are far far stronger than our pain. It can come in waves, move through us, spice up our life, but suffering, that happens when we fight it, shut the doors and hold off, shouting, \u201cNo. You should not be here.","And out there, beyond the haze of the Milky Way, galaxies and nebulas, and more galaxies, so many, our rock just a minor speck of sand in the beach of the Universe. When I think of that, I think of myself, so tiny and brief, and yet, who I am, the potential of me so big and vast.","Whether accidental or designed or a cosmic joke between green aliens, the human experience is an unbelievably amazing one. Our ability to love and create \u2014 that alone makes this entire experiment worthwhile.","If there is one lesson I\u2019ve learned from failure and success, it\u2019s this. I am not the outcome. I am never the result. I am only the effort.","And here\'s the interesting part.\xa0 When we love ourselves, we naturally shine, we are naturally beautiful.\xa0 And that draws others to us.\xa0 Before we know it, they\'re loving us and it\'s up to us to choose who to share our love with.","I may not be able to change someone. I may not be able to change a circumstance. But I can change myself, how I respond, who I am being. That is where all the power resides. Inside. A","Beautiful irony.\xa0 Fall in love with yourself.\xa0 Let your love express itself and the world will beat a path to your door to fall in love with you.","The truth in life is, we are born, we exist, then we are gone. That\u2019s it. What happens before or after is your personal belief, and if you have one, you should live it fully.","The insights we receive when going silent, it\'s our gift to ourselves. Returning and living them, sharing them, that is our gift to the world.","If there\u2019s a definition of freedom, I think it\u2019s this: living life on your terms.","Life is long, a chain of intertwining moments, looping round and round. But life is short. Blinks. Memories. Connections. Then you\u2019re gone.","Can I succeed at it, this way of living? I don\u2019t know. But I will remind myself daily: I am mortal. I will feel gratitude for it. For another opportunity to be here, to live and love and hurt and play and create and make good and bad decisions. Life.","Here\u2019s something I\u2019ve learned about truth. When you first discover and live it, it transforms your life. In no uncertain ways. But it doesn\u2019t end there. You cannot stay at the same level as when you first practiced your truth, life won\u2019t let you. Life is entropy. A beautiful chaos. But with rhythm, underpinnings of clockwork. Almost as if designed to push you to the next stage of your growth.","I had a breakup that devastated me. My first love. It was the worst thing I could have imagined. Looking back, it\u2019s one of the best things that ever happened to me. The relationship was long over, it was my insecurities that were desperately hanging on.","Whatever ego you\u2019ve developed, look hard at it. You will find aspects that no longer serve you. Strip away the layers. Be vulnerable. Be open.","stepping through hallucinated snakes builds trust in yourself. You realize that you are more powerful than your illusions. But no book or person can do this for you. Only you can.","Success and failure come and go but don\u2019t let them define you. It\u2019s who you are that matters. And if the outcome doesn\u2019t match your desire, you won\u2019t crash in the process. Instead, you\u2019ll walk away with the lessons learned and go on to create far greater things.","Each time I\u2019ve fought it, I\u2019ve suffered. But when I\u2019ve let go and looked inside to who I am, how I can be better, using my truth as a guide, it\u2019s taken me to the next level.","What we do and experience, those are like fireworks in the night sky. Sometimes pretty, sometimes scary, lots of booms and oohs and aahs. Flash, bang, gone. None lasting, none real. What is real is the one within who watches these fireworks. The inner self, it knows truth. Truth doesn\u2019t change. It is the real you, regardless of your life story. Truth is what heals you, what saves you. Truth makes you rise to new heights, no matter where you are.","If you can, make conscious periodic commitments to dive deeper into your truth, into living it fiercely. But if you get lazy and slide for a while, don\u2019t worry. The gears are winding. Life will kick in, make you step up.","The thing is, we\u2019re human beings living our lives, doing the best we can. No one dropped us off with instruction manuals. No, if in situation X, flip to page 243 and choose solution Y. Life is a series of choices and all we can do is make them.","What we believe, that\'s what we seek, it\'s the filter we view our lives through.","The magic is that as we live our truth, life does seem to calm down, as if that\u2019s all it needed from us anyway. To be our real selves.","I once asked a monk how he found peace. \\"I say \'yes,\'\\" he\'d said.\xa0 \\"To all that happens, I say \'yes.","Creating anything that never existed before is not sanity. Sanity is locking yourself in a box and being fed three times a day. Creating is not safe, it is not risk free. It is putting yourself fully into something that the world will judge. That is madness.","We all have unfulfilled dreams and goals and desires. Unfulfilled, why? Reasons pop up, but they\u2019re just guises for fear. Fear that we\u2019re not good enough. Fear that we\u2019ll fail. Fear that our fears will be true. Whatever the rationalization is, it is fear. And fear is not the truth.","I\u2019m old enough to have lost friends. Random deaths are tough. Suicides, the worst. I\u2019ve also lived long enough to look back at those gone and know that whatever they were dealing with, it passed. They didn\u2019t have to. They could have been here, wiser and stronger and better.","No matter how smart we may think we are, no matter how committed we are to our truth, we can lose our way. We\u2019re human. Made of flesh and feelings, not armor. And knowing that, there is something we can do to let in the light when we\u2019re fighting it the most.","I think the greatest moments in our lives, the defining ones, they are when we cross this threshold. Take that risk, make that commitment, fling open the door.","The act of going within, finding our truth, and then sharing it, it helps us far more than we know. Because when you find that gift and express it to the world, it is better, you are better. It\u2019s just the way things are.","Creating something of value, expressing yourself to the world \u2014 it is risk. Love is risk. And like love, it is often foolish. Madness even.

Instead, I just focus on making it true, knowing that is all I am required to do.","It\u2019s not comfortable, mind you. Truth isn\u2019t always. It requires facing fears, standing up to dragons.
