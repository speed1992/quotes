If you know yourself but not the enemy, for every victory gained you will also suffer a defeat. If you know neither the enemy nor yourself, you will succumb in every battle.","Victory comes from finding opportunities in problems.","The opportunity of defeating the enemy is provided by the enemy himself.","Victory is reserved for those who are willing to pay its price.","The greatest victory is that which requires no battle.","If you are strong, appear weak. But if you are weak, appear strong.","In the midst of chaos, there is also opportunity.","If a battle can not be won do not fight it.","Strategy without tactics is the slowest route to victory. Tactics without strategy is the noise before defeat.","One need not destroy one\'s enemy. One need only destroy his willingness to engage.","All warfare is based on deception. Therefore, when capable, feign incapacity; when active, inactivity. When near, make it appear that you are far away; when far away, that you are to lure him; feign disorder and strike him. When he concentrates, prepare against him; where he is strong, avoid him. Anger his general and confuse him. Pretend inferiority and encourage his arrogance.","The supreme art of war is to subdue the enemy without fighting.","Those who are victorious plan effectively and change decisively. They are like a great river that maintains its course but adjusts its flow.","Plan for what is difficult while it is easy, do what is great while it is small.","To know your Enemy, you must become your Enemy.","Let your plans be dark and impenetrable as night.","He will win who knows when to fight and when not to fight.","Swift as the wind. Quiet as the forest. Conquer like the fire. Steady as the mountain","These are the six ways of courting defeat - neglect to estimate the enemy\'s strength; want of authority; defective training; unjustifiable anger; nonobservance of discipline; failure to use picked men.","The line between disorder and order lies in logistics.","Victorious warriors win first and then go to war, while defeated warriors go to war first and then seek to win.","Engage people with what they expect; it is what they are able to discern and confirms their projections. It settles them into predictable patterns of response, occupying their minds while you wait for the extraordinary moment - that which they cannot anticipate.","Pretend to be weak, so your enemy may grow arrogant.","A leader leads by example not by force.","Kill one, terrify a thousand.","Correct your mistake as soon as you have found it.","Do not engage an enemy more powerful than you. And if it is unavoidable and you do have to engage, then make sure you engage it on your terms, not on your enemy\'s terms.","Concentrate your energy and hoard your strength.","Convince your enemy that he will gain very little by attacking you; this will diminish his enthusiasm","All war is based on deception.","A warrior who is prepared to fight must also be prepared to die.","All wars are won or lost before they are ever fought.","The peak efficiency of knowledge and strategy is to make conflict unnecessary.","If your enemy is superior, evade him","However desperate the situation and circumstances, don\'t despair. When there is everything to fear, be unafraid. When surrounded by dangers, fear none of them. When without resources, depend on resourcefulness. When surprised, take the enemy by surprise.","Sweat more during peace: bleed less during war","Don\'t flail against the world, use it. Flexibility is the operative principle in the art of war.","Weak leadership can wreck the soundest strategy","Opportunities increase as they are taken.","When torrential water tosses boulders, it is because of its momentum. When the strike of a hawk breaks the body of its prey, it is because of timing.","Weak leadership can wreck the soundest strategy; forceful execution of even a poor plan can often bring victory.","He who relies solely on warlike measures shall be exterminated; he who relies solely on peaceful measures shall perish.","Opportunities multiply as they are seized.","Be extremely subtle, even to the point of formlessness. Be extremely mysterious, even to the point of soundlessness. Thereby you can be the director of the opponent\'s fate.","Wait by the river long enough and the body of your enemy will float by you.","Attack like the Fire and be still as the Mountain","Ultimate excellence lies not in winning every battle, but in defeating the enemy without ever fighting.","He who knows his enemy and himself well will not be defeated easily.","Be where your enemy is not.","Unless you enter the tiger\'s lair, you cannot get hold of the tiger\'s cub\'s.","When the leader is morally weak and his discipline not strict, when his instructions and guidance are not enlightened, when there are no consistent rules, neighboring rulers will take advantage of this.","So the principles of warfare are: Do not depend on the enemy not coming, but depend on our readiness against him. Do not depend on the enemy not attacking, but depend on our position that cannot be attacked.","The skilful employer of men will employ the wise man, the brave man, the covetous man, and the stupid man.","Prohibit the taking of omens, and do away with superstitious doubts. Then, until death itself comes, no calamity need be feared.","Begin by seizing something which your opponent holds dear; then he will be amenable to your will.","Ponder and deliberate before you make a move.","So a military force has no constant formation, water has no constant shape: the ability to gain victory by changing and adapting according to the opponent is called genius.","Great results, can be achieved with small forces.","In all history, there is no instance of a country having benefited from prolonged warfare. Only one who knows the disastrous effects of a long war can realize the supreme importance of rapidity in bringing it to a close.","Regard your soldiers as your children, and they will follow you into the deepest valleys; look upon them as your own beloved sons, and they will stand by you even unto death.","Hold out baits to entice the enemy. Feign disorder, and crush him.","Appear weak when you are strong, and strong when you are weak.","You can prevent your opponent from defeating you through defense, but you cannot defeat him without taking the offensive.","There are five dangerous faults which may affect a general: recklessness, which leads to destruction; cowardice, which leads to capture; a hasty temper, which can be provoked by insults; a delicacy of honour, which is sensitive to shame; over-solicitude for his men, which exposes him to worry and trouble.","The nature of war is constant change.","When strong, avoid them. If of high morale, depress them. Seem humble to fill them with conceit. If at ease, exhaust them. If united, separate them. Attack their weaknesses. Emerge to their surprise.","Rewards for good service should not be deferred a single day.","If their forces are substantial, prepare for them; if their forces are strong, avoid them.","When you surround an army, leave an outlet free. Do not press a desperate foe too hard.","If fighting is sure to result in victory, then you must fight.","If it is to your advantage, make a forward move; if not, stay where you are.","Appear at points which the enemy must hasten to defend; march swiftly to places where you are not expected.","If the enemy leaves a door open, you must rush in.","A battle avoided cannot be lost.","Thus the expert in battle moves the enemy, and is not moved by him.","In desperate position, you must fight.","Build your opponent a golden bridge to retreat across.","One who speaks deferentially but increases his preparations will advance. One who speaks belligerently and advances hastily will retreat.","Attack is the secret of defense; defense is the planning of an attack.","If the mind is willing, the flesh could go on and on without many things.","He will win whose army is animated by the same spirit throughout all its ranks.","Invincibility lies in the defense; the possibility of victory in the attack.","Confront them with annihilation, and they will then survive; plunge them into a deadly situation, and they will then live. When people fall into danger, they are then able to strive for victory.","When I have won a victory I do not repeat my tactics but respond to circumstances in an infinite variety of ways.","The enemy\'s spies who have come to spy on us must be sought out, tempted with bribes, led away and comfortably housed. Thus they will become double agents and available for our service. It is through the information brought by the double agent that we are able to acquire and employ local and inward spies. It is owing to his information, again, that we can cause the doomed spy to carry false tidings to the enemy.","The value of time, that is of being a little ahead of your opponent, often provides greater advantage than superior numbers or greater resources.","The true objective of war is peace.","What is of the greatest importance in war is extraordinary speed: One cannot afford to neglect opportunity.","If you follow the enemy\'s shifts and changes, you can always find a way to win.","In war, then, let your great object be victory, not lengthy campaigns.","Know thy self, know thy enemy. A thousand battles, a thousand victories.","Those who do not know the plans of competitors cannot prepare alliances. Those who do not know the lay of the land cannot maneuver their forces. Those who do not use local guides cannot take advantage of the ground.","He who knows things, and in fighting puts his knowledge into practice, will win his battles. He who knows them not, nor practices them, will surely be defeated.","Probe him and learn where his strength is abundant and where deficient.","He will win who knows how to handle both superior and inferior forces.","To ... not prepare is the greatest of crimes; to be prepared beforehand for any contingency is the greatest of virtues.","Management of many is the same as management of few. It is a matter of organization.","You cannot know if you will be successful or not. You can only prepare for battle and it must be done with all of your heart and with all of your consciousness. In that manner, you will have an edge.","The height of strategy, is to attack your opponent\'s strategy.","Agitate him and ascertain the pattern of his movement.","Attack the enemy\'s strategy.","Go into emptiness, strike voids, bypass what he defends hit him where he does not expect you.","One mark of a great soldier is that he fight on his own terms or fights not at all.","He who wishes to fight must first count the cost","There are roads which must not be followed, armies which must not be attacked, towns which must not be besieged, positions which must not be contested, commands of the sovereign which must not be obeyed.","Plan for what is difficult while it is easy, do what is great while it is small. The difficult things in this world must be done while they are easy, the greatest things in the world must be done while they are still small. For this reason sages never do what is great, and this is why they achieve greatness.","If you know both yourself and your enemy, you can win a hundred battles without a single loss.","In conflict, straightforward actions generally lead to engagement, surprising actions generally lead to victory.","To fight and conquer in all our battles is not supreme excellence; supreme excellence consists in breaking the enemy\'s resistance without fighting.","No ruler should put troops into the field merely to gratify his own spleen; no general should fight a battle simply out of pique.","If you fight with all your might, there is a chance of life; where as death is certain if you cling to your corner","What is essential in war is victory, not prolonged operations.","He who is prudent and lies in wait for an enemy who is not, will be victorious.","Military tactics are like unto water; for water in its natural course runs away from high places and hastens downwards... Water shapes its course according to the nature of the ground over which it flows; the soldier works out his victory in relation to the foe whom he is facing. Therefore, just as water retains no constant shape, so in warfare there are no constant conditions. He who can modify his tactics in relation to his opponent and thereby succeed in winning, may be called a heaven-born captain.","Weigh the situation, then move.","Nothing is more difficult than the art of maneuvering for advantageous positions.","Whoever is first in the field and awaits the coming of the enemy, will be fresh for the fight; whoever is second in the field and has to hasten to battle will arrive exhausted.","Attack him where he is unprepared, appear where you are not expected.","For the wise man delights in establishing his merit, the brave man likes to show his courage in action, the covetous man is quick at seizing advantages, and the stupid man has no fear of death.","Winning isn\'t enough. The acme of all skill is to defeat your enemy before taking the field.","If the enemy opens the door, you must race in.","What is of supreme importance in war is to attack the enemy\'s strategy.","The clever combatant imposes his will on the enemy, but does not allow the enemy\'s will to be imposed on him.","And therefore those skilled in war bring the enemy to the field of battle and are not brought there by him.","Generally, management of many is the same as management of few. It is a matter of organization. And to control many is the same as to control few. This is a matter of formations and signals.","The opportunity to secure ourselves against defeat lies in our own hands","Unhappy is the fate of one who tries to win his battles and succeed in his attacks without cultivating the spirit of enterprise, for the result is waste of time and general stagnation.","The general who advances without coveting fame and retreats without fearing disgrace, whose only thought is to protect his country and do good service for his sovereign, is the jewel of the kingdom.","He will win who, prepared himself, waits to take the enemy unprepared.","In war, practice dissimulation and you will succeed.","When you shoot a bow and arrow, you aim at the clouds, not because you expect to hit them, but so that you may reach the distant target on the ground.","So in war, the way is to avoid what is strong, and strike at what is weak.","Those who are victorious plan effectively and change decisively. They are like a great river that maintains its course but adjusts its flow...they have form but are formless. They are skilled in both planning and adapting and need not fear the result of a thousand battles: for they win in advance, defeating those that have already lost.","Of old the expert in battle would first make himself invincible and then wait for his enemy to expose his vulnerability.","The expert in battle seeks his victory from strategic advantage and does not demand it from his men.","I will be able to forecast which side will be victorious and which defeated.","Those who would wage war, should first eliminate all domestic enemies before proceeding to attack the external foe.","Therefore, just as water retains no constant shape, so in warfare there are no constant conditions.","In the midst of difficulties we are always ready to seize an advantage, we may extricate ourselves from misfortune.","One defends when his strength is inadequate, he attacks when it is abundant.","When one treats people with benevolence, justice and righteousness, and reposes confidence in them, the army will be united in mind and all will be happy to serve their leaders.","What the ancients called a clever fighter is one who not only wins, but excels in winning with ease.","Energy may be likened to the bending of a crossbow; decision, to the releasing of a trigger.","If your enemy is secure at all points, be prepared for him. If he is in superior strength, evade him. If your opponent is tempermental, seek to irritate him. Pretend to be weak, that he may grow arrogant. If he is taking his ease, give him no rest. If his forces are united, separate them. If sovereign and subject are in accord, put division between them. Attack him where he is unprepared, appear where you are not expected.","Who does not know the evils of war cannot appreciate its benefits.","There is no place where espionage is not possible.","Rapidity is the essence of war: take advantage of the enemy\'s unreadiness, make your way by unexpected routes, and attack unguarded spots.","He who exercises no forethought but makes light of his opponents is sure to be captured by them.","One who has few must prepare against the enemy; one who has many makes the enemy prepare against him.","The good fighters of old first put themselves beyond the possibility of defeat, and then waited for an opportunity of defeating the enemy.","The successful person has unusual skill at dealing with conflict and ensuring the best outcome for all.","In warfare, there are no constant conditions. He who can modify his tactics in relation to his opponent will succeed and win.","When your weapons are dulled and ardour damped, your strength exhausted and treasure spent, neighboring rulers will take advantage of your distress to act. And even though you have wise counsellors, none will be able to lay good plans for the future. Thus, while we have heard of blundering swiftness in war, we have not yet seen a clever operation that was prolonged.","The military has no constant form, just as water has no constant shape - adapt as you face the enemy, without letting them know beforehand what you are going to do.","Keep their friends close and their enemies closer.","When the general is weak and without authority; when his orders are not clear and distinct; when there are no fixed duties assigned to officers and men, and the ranks are formed in a slovenly haphazard manner, the result is utter disorganization.","It is the business of a general to be quiet and thus ensure secrecy; upright and just, and thus maintain order.","Without harmony in the State, no military expedition can be undertaken; without harmony in the army, no battle array can be formed.","Ground which can be abandoned but is hard to re-occupy is called entangling.","Who can determine where one ends and the other begins?","Throw your soldiers into positions whence there is no escape, and they will prefer death to flight. If they will face death, there is nothing they may not achieve.","If we wish to fight, the enemy can be forced to an engagement even though he be sheltered behind a high rampart and a deep ditch. All we need do is attack some other place that he will be obliged to relieve.","The quality of decision is like the well-timed swoop of a falcon which enables it to strike and destroy its victim.","It is the business of a general to be serene and inscrutable, impartial and self-controlled.","No ruler should put troops into the field merely to gratify his own spleen; no general should fight a battle simply out of pique. If it is to your advantage, make a forward move; if not, stay where you are. Anger may in time change to gladness; vexation may be succeeded by content. But a kingdom that has once been destroyed can never come again into being; nor can the dead ever be brought back to life.","The business of a general is to kick away the ladder behind soldiers when they have climbed up a height.","Move not unless you see an advantage; use not your troops unless there is something to be gained; fight not unless the position is critical.","To plan secretly, to move surreptitiously, to foil the enemy\'s intentions and balk his schemes, so that at last the day may be won without shedding a drop of blood.","Know thy enemy and know thy self and you will win a hundred battles.","It is only the enlightened ruler and the wise general who will use the highest intelligence of the army for the purposes of spying, and thereby they achieve great results.","The good fighter is able to secure himself against defeat, but cannot make certain of defeating the enemy.","Attack where he is unprepared; sally forth when he does not expect you.","When you know both yourself as well as your competition, you are never in danger. To know yourself and not others, gives you half a chance of winning.  Knowing neither yourself or your competition puts you in a position to lose.","All warfare is based on deception. Hence, when able to attack, we must seem unable; when using our forces, we must seem inactive; when we are near, we must make the enemy believe we are far away; when far away, we must make him believe we are near.","The control of large numbers is possible, and like unto that of small numbers, if we subdivide them.","First learn to become invincible, then wait for your enemy\'s moment of vulnerability.","Thus those skilled in war subdue the enemy\'s army without battle .... They conquer by strategy.","If your opponent is of choleric temper, seek to irritate him. Pretend to be weak, that he may grow arrogant.","This does not mean that the enemy is to be allowed to escape. The object is to make him believe that there is a road to safety, and thus prevent his fighting with the courage of despair. After that, you may crush him.","When the enemy is relaxed, make them toil. When full, starve them. When settled, make them move.","Therefore the skillful leader subdues the enemy\'s troops without any fighting; he captures their cities without laying siege to them; he overthrows their kingdom without lengthy operations in the field.","When the common soldiers are too strong and their officers too weak, the result is insubordination. When the officers are too strong and the common soldiers too weak, the result is collapse.","Factors in the art of warfare are: First, calculations; second, quantities; third, logistics; fourth, the balance of power; and fifth, the possibility of victory is based on the balance of power.","Humble words and increased preparations are signs that the enemy is about to advance. Violent language and driving forward as if to the attack are signs that he will retreat.","When your opponent gives you an opening, be swift as a hare.","There are routes not to be followed, armies not to be attacked, citadels not to be besieged, territory not to be fought over.","A sovereign of high character and intelligence must be able to know the right man, should place the responsibility on him, and expect results.","To capture the enemy\'s entire army is better than to destroy it; to take intact a regiment, a company, or a squad is better than to destroy them. For to win one hundred victories in one hundred battles is not the supreme of excellence. To subdue the enemy without fighting is the supreme excellence.","Perfection in war lies in so sapping your opponents will that he surrenders without fighting.","Making no mistakes is what establishes the certainty of victory, for it means conquering an enemy that is already defeated.","In war, numbers alone confer no advantage. Do not advance relying on sheer military power.","To persuade your enemy to (retreat) before the fight is to defeat them even before the battle begins. An enemy made ally is no longer an enemy.","It is ten thousand times cheaper to pay the best spies lavishly than even a tiny army poorly.","The art of war teaches us to rely not on the likelihood of the enemy\'s not coming, but on our own readiness to receive him; not on the chance of his not attacking, but rather on the fact that we have made our position unassailable.","Act after having made assessments. The one who first knows the measure of far and near wins - this is the rule of armed struggle.","In the practical art of war, the best thing of all is to take the enemy\'s country whole and intact; to shatter and destroy it is not so good.","The essential factor of military success is speed, that is taking advantage of others\' unpreparedness or lack of foresight, their failure to catch up, going by routes they do not expect, attacking where they are not on guard. This you cannot accomplish with hesitation.","Rely not on the likelihood of the enemy\'s not coming, but on our own readiness to receive him","Too frequent rewards indicate that the general is at the end of his resources; too frequent punishments that he is in acute distress.","He who is not sage and wise, humane and just, cannot use secret agent.s. And he who is not delicate and subtle cannot get the truth out of them.","Thus it is that in war the victorious strategist only seeks battle after the victory has been won, whereas he who is destined to defeat first fights and afterwards looks for victory.","Set the troops to their tasks without imparting your designs.","What enables the wise sovereign and the good general to strike and conquer, and achieve things beyond the reach of ordinary men, is foreknowledge.","It is imperative to contest all factions for complete victory, so the army is not garrisoned and the profit can be total. This is the law of strategic siege.","If quick, I survive. If not quick, I am lost. This is death.","Do not swallow bait offered by the enemy. Do not interfere with an army that is returning home.","When the higher officers are angry and insubordinate, and on meeting the enemy give battle on their own account from a feeling of resentment, before the commander-in-chief can tell whether or not he is in a position to fight, the result is ruin.","Carefully compare the opposing army with your own, so that you may know where strength is superabundant and where it is deficient.","If ignorant both of your enemy and yourself, you are certain to be in peril.","The King is only fond of words, and cannot translate them into deeds.","O divine art of subtlety and secrecy! Through you we learn to be invisible, through you inaudible and hence we can hold the enemy\'s fate in our hands.","Those who excel in war first cultivate their own humanity and  and maintain their laws and institutions. By these means they make their governments invincible.","The art of using troops is this:\\n......When ten to the enemy\'s one, surround him;\\n......When five times his strength, attack him;\\n......If double his strength, divide him;\\n......If equally matched you may engage him;\\n......If weaker numerically, be capable of withdrawing;\\n......And if in all respects unequal, be capable of eluding him,\\n..........for a small force is but booty for one more powerful.","One who sets the entire army in motion to chase an advantage will not attain it.","Like the sun and moon, they end but to begin anew; like the four seasons, they pass away to return once more.","The art of giving orders is not to try to rectify the minor blunders and not be swayed by petty doubts.","All men can see these tactics whereby I conquer, but what none can see is the strategy out of which victory is evolved.","If you know yourself but not the enemy, for every victory gained you will also suffer a defeat.","Subtle and insubstantial, the expert leaves no trace; divinely mysterious, he is inaudible. Thus he is master of his enemy\'s fate.","To Subdue an enemy without fighting is the greatest of skills","Those whose upper and lower ranks have the same desire are victorious.","Until death itself comes, no calamity need be feared","On dispersive ground, therefore, fight not. On facile ground, halt not. On contentious ground, attack not. On open ground, do not try to block the enemy\'s way. On the ground of intersecting highways, join hands with your allies. On serious ground, gather in plunder. In difficult ground, keep steadily on the march. On hemmed-in ground, resort to stratagem. On desperate ground, fight.","You can ensure the success of your attacks if you only attack places that are undefended. You can ensure the safety of your defense if you only hold positions that cannot be attacked. Therefore, that general is skillful in attack whose opponent does not know what to defend; and he is skillful in defense whose opponent does not know what to attack.","If soldiers are punished before they have grown attached to you, they will not prove submissive; and, unless submissive, then will be practically useless. If, when the soldiers have become attached to you, punishments are not enforced, they will still be unless.","For to win one hundred victories in one hundred battles is not the acme of skill. To subdue the enemy without fighting is the acme of skill.","A kingdom that has once been destroyed can never come again into being; nor can the dead ever be brought back to life.","There are three ways in which a ruler can bring misfortune on his army: By commanding the army to advance or to retreat, being ignorant of the fact that it cannot obey. This is called hobbling the army. By attempting to govern an army in the same way as he administers a kingdom, being ignorant of the conditions which obtain in an army. This causes restlessness in the soldier\'s minds. By employing the officers of his army without discrimination, through ignorance of the military principle of adaptation to circumstances. This shakes the confidence of the soldiers.","To a surrounded enemy, you must leave a way of escape.","As water shapes its flow in accordance with the ground, so an army manages its victory in accordance with the situation of the enemy.","If we know that the enemy is open to attack, but are unaware that our own men are not in a condition to attack, we have gone only halfway towards victory.","Those skilled at making the enemy move do so by creating a situation to which he must conform; they entice him with something he is certain to take, and with lures of ostensible profit they await him in strength.","In all fighting, the direct method may be used for joining battle, but indirect methods will be needed in order to secure victory.","Know the enemy, know yourself; your victory will never be endangered. Know the ground, know the weather; your victory will then be total.","The spot where we intend to fight must not be made known; for then the enemy will have to prepare against a possible attack at several different points; and his forces being thus distributed in many directions, the numbers we shall have to face at any given point will be proportionately few.","Hence the experienced soldier, once in motion, is never bewildered; once he has broken camp, he is never at a loss.","There are not more than five musical notes, yet the combinations of these five give rise to more melodies than can ever be heard.","If not in the interests of the state, do not act. If you cannot succeed, do not use troops. If you are not in danger, do not fight.","In all fighting, the direct method may be used for joining battle, but indirect methods will be needed in order to secure victory. In battle, there are not more than two methods of attack.. the direct and the indirect; yet these two in combination give rise to an endless series of maneuvers.","A military operation involves deception. Even though you are competent, appear to be incompetent. Though effective, appear to be ineffective.","Unless you know the mountains and the forests, the defiles and impasses, the lay of the marshes and swamps, you cannot maneuver with an armed force. Unless you use local guides, you cannot get the advantages of the land.","Be subtle! be subtle! and use your spies for every kind of business.","Pretend inferiority and encourage his arrogance.","The skillful tactician may be likened to the shuai-jan. Now the shuai-jan is a snake that is found in the Ch\'ang mountains. Strike at its head, and you will be attacked by its tail; strike at its tail, and you will be attacked by its head; strike at its middle, and you will be attacked by head and tail both.","The clever combatant looks to the effect of combined energy, and does not require too much from individuals. Hence his ability to pick out the right men and utilize combined energy","When you are ignorant of the enemy but know yourself, your chances of winning or losing are equal.","In peace prepare for war, in war prepare for peace. The art of war is of vital importance to the state. It is matter of life and death, a road either to safety or to ruin. Hence under no circumstances can it be neglected.","In a position of this sort, even though the enemy should offer us an attractive bait, it will be advisable not to stir forth, but rather to retreat, thus enticing the enemy in his turn; then, when part of his army has come out, we may deliver our attack with advantage.","We cannot enter into alliances until we are acquainted with the designs of our neighbors. We are not fit to lead an army on the march unless we are familiar with the face of the country.","If this is long delayed, weapons are blunted and morale depressed.","When he pretends to flee, do not pursue.","There is an intelligent way to eat a live frog - I just don\'t know what it is.","A wise general makes a point of foraging of the enemy.","Knowledge of the enemy\'s dispositions can only be obtained from other men.","As water has no constant form, there are in war no constant conditions.","Keep your friends close and your enemies even closer.","With regard to precipitous heights, if you are beforehand with your adversary, you should occupy the raised and sunny spots, and there wait for him to come up.","Defeat the enemies strategy.","It is only one who is thoroughly acquainted with the evils of war that can thoroughly understand the profitable way of carrying it on.","In your deliberations, when seeking to determine the military conditions, let them be made the basis of a comparison, in this wise: which of the two generals has the most ability? on which side is Discipline most rigorously enforced? which army is stronger? on which side are the officers and men more highly trained? in which army is there the greater constancy both in reward and punishment?","The best general is the one who never fights.","The enlightened ruler is heedful, and the good general full of caution.","Therefore the good fighter will be terrible in his onset, and prompt in his decision.","Use humility to make the enemy haughty. Tire them by flight. Cause division among them. When they are unprepared, attack and make your move when they do not expect it.","In the tumult and uproar, the battle seems chaotic, but there is no disorder, the troops appear to be milling about in circles but cannot be defeated.","Order or disorder depends on organisation and direction; courage or cowardice on circumstances; strength or weakness on tactical dispositions.","Invincibility is in oneself, and vulnerability is in the opponent. Invincibility is a matter of defense, vulnerability is a matter of attack. Therefore skillful warriors are able to be invincible, but they cannot cause opponents to be vulnerable. That is why it is said that victory is discerned and not manufactured.","So the important thing in a military operation is victory, not persistence.","The skillful leader subdues the enemy\'s troops without any fighting.","If a general shows confidence in his men but always insists on his orders being obeyed, the gain will be mutual.","They [spies] cannot be properly managed without benevolence and straightforwardness.","We cannot enter into alliance with neighbouring princes until we are acquainted with their designs. We are not fit to lead an army on the march unless we are familiar with the face of the country - its mountains and forests, its pitfalls and precipices, its marshes and swamps. We shall be unable to turn natural advantages to account unless we make use of local guides.","Every battle is won before it is fought.","Therefore I say: know the enemy and know yourself; in a hundred battles you will never be in peril. When you are ignorant of the enemy but know yourself, your chances of winning or losing are equal. If ignorant both of your enemy and of yourself, you are certain in every battle to be in peril.","The general who wins the battle makes many calculations in his temple before the battle is fought. The general who loses makes but few calculations beforehand.","It is a doctrine of war not to assume the enemy will not come, but rather to rely on one\'s readiness to meet him; not to presume that he will not attack, but rather to make one\'s self invincible.","Should one ask: \'how do I cope with a well-ordered enemy host about to attack me?\' I reply: seize something he cherishes and he will conform to your desires.","Birds rising in flight is a sign that the enemy is lying in ambush; when the wild animals are startled and flee he is trying to take you unaware.","So there are five ways of knowing who will win. Those who know when to fight and when not to fight are victorious. Those who discern when to use many or few troops are victorious. Those whose upper and lower ranks have the same desire are victorious.","Without local guides, your enemy employs the land as a weapon against you.","The end and aim of spying in all its five varieties is knowledge of the enemy; and this knowledge can only be derived, in the first instance, from the converted spy. Hence it is essential that the converted spy be treated with the utmost liberality.","It is through the dispositions of an army that its condition may be discovered. Conceal your dispositions, and your condition will remain secret, which leads to victory,; show your dispositions, and your condition will become patent, which leads to defeat.","There are not more than five musical notes, yet the combinations of these five give rise to more melodies than can ever be heard.There are not more than five primary colors, yet in combination they produce more hues than can ever been seen.There are not more than five cardinal tastes, yet combinations of them yield more flavors than can ever be tasted.","Thus the highest form of generalship is to balk the enemy\'s plans, the next best is to prevent the junction of the enemy\'s forces, the next in order is to attack the enemy\'s army in the field, and the worst policy of all is to besiege walled cities.","There are only five notes in the musical scale, but their variations are so many that they cannot all be heard. There are only five basic colors, but their variations are so many that they cannot all be seen. There are only five basic flavors, but their variations are so many that they cannot all be tasted. There are only two kinds of charge in battle, the unorthodox surprise attack and the orthodox direct attack, but variations of the unorthodox and the orthodox are endless. The unorthodox and the orthodox give rise to each other, like a beginningless circle-who could exhaust them?","Be the first to seize intersecting ground, that is ground which lies the intersections of borders or intersections of main thoroughfares of commerce and travel. Your occupation of it gives you access to all who border it and all who would covet it. On intersecting ground, if you establish alliances you are safe, if you lose alliances you are in peril.","Thus we may know that there are five essentials for victory: He will win who knows when to fight and when not to fight. He will win who knows how to handle both superior and inferior forces. He will win whose army is animated by the same spirit throughout all its ranks. He will win who, prepared himself, waits to take the enemy unprepared. He will win who has military capacity and is not interfered with by the sovereign.","It is essential to seek out enemy agents who have come to conduct espionage against you and to bribe them to serve you. Give them instructions and care for them. Thus doubled agents are recruited and used.","Whoever is the first in the field and awaits the coming of the enemy will be fresh for the fight... Therefore the clever combatant imposes his will on the enemy... By holding out advantages to him, he can cause the enemy to approach of his own accord; or by inflicting damage, he can make it impossible for the enemy to draw near.","Fighting with a large army under your command is nowise different from fighting with a small one: it is merely a question of instituting signs and signals.","By altering his arrangements and changing his plans, the skillful general keeps the enemy without definite knowledge. By shifting his camp and taking circuitous routes, he prevents the enemy from anticipating his purpose. At the critical moment, the leader of an army acts like one who has climbed up a height and then kicks away the ladder behind him.","To capture an enemies army is better than to destroy it.","On the field of battle, the spoken word does not carry far enough; hence the institution of gongs and drums... banners and flags. Gongs and drums, banners and flags, are means whereby the ears and eyes of the host may be focused on one particular point.","Appraise war in terms of the fundamental factors. The first of these factors is moral influence.","And therefore only the enlightened sovereign and the worthy general who are able to use the most intelligent people as agents are certain to achieve great things.","The good fighters of old first put themselves beyond the possibility of defeat, and then waited for an opportunity of defeating the enemy. To secure ourselves against defeat lies in our own hands, but the opportunity of defeating the enemy is provided by the enemy himself. Thus the good fighter is able to secure himself against defeat, but cannot make certain of defeating the enemy.","Ground which can be freely traversed by both sides is called accessible.","When the enemy is at ease, be able to weary him; when well fed, to starve him; when at rest, to make him move. Appear at places to which he must hasten; move swiftly where he does not expect you.","Hostile armies may face each other for years, striving for the victory which is decided in a single day. This being so, to remain in ignorance of the enemy\'s condition simply because one grudges the outlay of a hundred ounces of silver in honors and emoluments, is the height of inhumanity.","With regard to ground of this nature, be before the enemy in occupying the raised and sunny spots, and carefully guard your line of supplies. Then you will be able to fight with advantage.","When the enemy\'s envoy\'s speak in humble terms, but continues his preparations, he will advance. When their language is deceptive but the enemy pretentiously advances, he will retreat. When the envoys speak in apologetic terms, he wishes a respite. When without a previous understanding the enemy asks for a truce, he is plotting. When the enemy sees an advantage but does not advance to seize it, he is fatigued.","Should the enemy forestall you in occupying a pass, do not go after him if the pass is fully garrisoned, but only if it is weakly garrisoned.","It is sufficient to estimate the enemy situation correctly and to concentrate your strength to capture him. There is no more to it than this. He who lacks foresight and underestimates his enemy will surely be captured by him.","the leader of armies is the arbiter of the people\'s fate, the man on whom it depends whether the nation shall be in peace or in peril.","It is according to the shapes that I lay the plans for victory, but the multitude does not comprehend this. Although everyone can see the outward aspects, none understands the way in which I have created victory.","Should the enemy strengthen his van, he will weaken his rear; should he strengthen his rear, he will weaken his van; should he strengthen his left, he will weaken his right; should he strengthen his right, he will weaken his left. If he sends reinforcements everywhere, he will everywhere be weak.","Secret operations are essential in war; upon them the army relies to make its every move.","Know the enemy and know yourself.","If there is disturbance in the camp, the general\'s authority is weak. If the banners and flags are shifted about, sedition is afoot. If the officers are angry, it means that the men are weary.","Hence the saying: The enlightened ruler lays his plans well ahead; the good general cultivates his resources.","Against those skilled in attack, an enemy does not know where to defend; against the experts in defense, the enemy does not know where to attack.","The general that hearkens to my counsel and acts upon it, will conquer: let such a one be retained in command! The general that hearkens not to my counsel nor acts upon it, will suffer defeat: - let such a one be dismissed!","If asked how to cope with a great host of the enemy in orderly array and on the point of marching to the attack, I should say: \\"Begin by seizing something which your opponent holds dear; then he will be amenable to your will.\\" Rapidity is the essence of war: take advantage of the enemy\'s unreadiness, make your way by unexpected routes, and attack unguarded spots.","Of all rewards none [is] more liberal than those given to secret agents.","Know the enemy and know yourself; in a hundred battles you will never peril.","The difficulty of tactical maneuvering consists in turning the devious into the direct, and misfortune into gain.","Other conditions being equal, if one force is hurled against another ten times its size, the result will be the flight of the former.","If you know neither the enemy nor yourself, you will succumb in every battle","Thus the skilful general conducts his army just as though he were leading a single man, willy-nilly, by the hand.","Ponder and deliberate before you make your move. He will conquer who has learned the artifice of deviation. Such is the art of maneuvering.","Spies cannot be usefully employed without a certain intuitive sagacity.","If we do not wish to fight, we can prevent the enemy from engaging us even though the lines of our encampment be merely traced out on the ground. All we need to do is to throw something odd and unaccountable in his way.","The General who in advancing does not seek personal fame, and in withdrawing is not concerned with avoiding punishment, but whose only purpose is to protect the people and promote the best interests of his sovereign, is the precious jewel of the state.","There is nothing more difficult than tactical maneuvering. The difficult consists in turning the devious into the direct, and misfortune into gain. Thus, to take a long and circuitous route after enticing the enemy out of the way, and though starting after him to contrive to reach the goal before him, shows knowledge of the artifice of deviation.","Bring war material with you from home, but forage on the enemy... use the conquered foe to augment one\'s own strength.","Amid the turmoil and tumult of battle, there may be seeming disorder and yet no real disorder at all.","Success in warfare is gained by carefully accommodating ourselves to the enemy\'s purpose.","It is the rule in war, if ten times the enemy\'s strength, surround them; if five times, attack them; if double, be able to divide them; if equal, engage them; if fewer, defend against them; if weaker, be able to avoid them.","The general must be the first in the toils and fatigues of the army. In the heat of summer he does not spread his parasol nor in the cold of winter don thick clothing. In dangerous places he must dismount and walk. He waits until the army\'s wells have been dug and only then drinks; until the army\'s food is cooked before he eats; until the army\'s fortifications have been completed, to shelter himself.","If I wish to engage, then the enemy, for all his high ramparts and deep moat, cannot avoid engagement; I attack that which he is obliged to rescue.","Someone unfamiliar with the mountains and forests cannot advance [the team]. One who does not employ local guides cannot gain the advantage.","If the enemy has occupied them before you, do not follow him, but retreat and try to entice him away.","Quickness is the essence of the war.","The dance of battle is always played to the same impatient rhythm. What begins in a surge of violent motion is always reduced to the perfectly still.","In making tactical dispositions, the highest pitch you can attain is to conceal them.","If you are situated at a great distance from the enemy, and the strength of the two armies is equal,  it is not easy to provoke a battle, and fighting will be to your disadvantage.","The supreme excellence is not to win a hundred victories in a hundred battles. The supreme excellence is to subdue the armies of your enemies without having to fight them.","An army may be likened to water, for just as flowing water avoids the heights and hastens to the lowlands, so an army avoids strength and strikes weakness.","Do not press an enemy at bay. Prince Fu Ch\'ai said: \\"Wild beasts, when at bay, fight desperately. How much more is this true of men! If they know there is no alternative, they will fight to the death.","The general who wins a battle makes many calculations in his temple ere the battle is fought. The general who loses a battle makes but few calculations beforehand. Thus do many calculations lead to victory, and few calculations to defeat: how much more no calculation at all! It is by attention to this point that I can foresee who is likely to win or lose.","There has never been a protracted war from which a country has benefitted.","Spies cannot be usefully employed without a certain intuitive sagacity; They cannot be properly managed without benevolence and straightforwardness; Without subtle ingenuity of mind, one cannot make certain of the truth of their reports; Be subtle! be subtle! and use your spies for every kind of warfare; If a secret piece of news is divulged by a spy before the time is ripe, he must be put to death together with the man to whom the secret was told.","When he utilizes combined energy, his fighting men become, as it were, like rolling logs or stones... The energy developed by good fighting men is as the momentum of a round stone rolled down a mountain thousands of feet in height.","Of all those in the army close to the commander none is more intimate than the secret agent; of all rewards none more liberal than those given to secret agents; of all matters none is more confidential than those relating to secret operations.","Hiding order beneath the cloak of disorder is simply a question of subdivision; concealing courage under a show of timidity presupposes a fund of latent energy; masking strength with weakness is to be effected by tactical dispositions.","Invincibility depends on one\'s self; the enemy\'s vulnerability on him.","Therefore a victorious army first wins and then seeks battle; a defeated army first battles and then seeks victory.","Therefore the victories of good warriors are not noted for cleverness or bravery. Therefore their victories in battle are not flukes. Their victories are not flukes because they position themselves where they will surely win, prevailing over those wh.","Fierce language and pretentious advances are signs that the enemy is about to retreat.","If fighting is sure to result in victory, then you must fight, even though the ruler forbid it; if fighting will not result in victory, then you must not fight even at the ruler\'s bidding.","The consummate leader cultivates the moral law, and strictly adheres to method and discipline; thus it is in his power to control success.","O divine art of subtlety and secrecy!","Without subtle ingenuity of mind, one cannot make certain of the truth of their reports.","The natural formation of the country is the soldier\'s best ally;  but a power of estimating the adversary,  of controlling the forces of victory,  and of shrewdly calculating difficulties, dangers and distances,  constitutes the test of a great general.","When orders are consistently trustworthy and observed, the relationship of a commander with his troops is satisfactory.","All warfare is based on deception. There is no place where espionage is not used. Offer the enemy bait to lure him.","If an enemy has alliances, the problem is grave and the enemy\'s position strong; if he has no alliances, the problem is minor and the enemy\'s position weak.","If those who are sent to draw water begin by drinking themselves, the army is suffering from thirst.","So it is that good warriors take their stance on ground where they cannot lose, and do not overlook conditions that make an opponent prone to defeat.","All war is deception.","To perceive victory when it is known to all is not really skilful. Everyone calls victory in battle good, but it is not really good.","When the thunderclap comes, there is no time to cover the ears.","There is no instance of a nation benefiting from prolonged warfare.","The natural formation of the country is the soldier\'s best ally","Nothing is more difficult than the art of maneuver. What is difficult about maneuver is to make the devious route the most direct and to turn misfortune to advantage.","Do not press an enemy at bay.","If you are far from the enemy, make him believe you are near.","The proximity of an army causes prices to go up; and high prices cause people\'s substance to be drained away. When their substance is drained away, they will be afflicted by heavy exactions. With this loss of substance and exhaustion of strength, the homes of the people will be stripped bare, and their incomes dissipated.","With regard to narrow passes, if you can occupy them first,  let them be strongly garrisoned and await the advent of the enemy.","At first, then, exhibit the coyness of a maiden, until the enemy gives you an opening; afterwards emulate the rapidity of a running hare, and it will be too late for the enemy to oppose you.","All battles are won before they start.","War is a matter of vital importance to the state; the province of life or death; the road to survival or ruin. It is mandatory that it be thoroughly studied.","Getting people to fight by letting the force of momentum work is like rolling logs and rocks. Logs and rocks are still when in a secure place, but roll on an incline; they remain stationary if square, they roll if round. Therefore, when people are skillfully led into battle, the momentum is like that of round rocks rolling down a high mountain - this is force.","The control of a large force is the same principle as the control of a few men: it is merely a question of dividing up their numbers.","All warfare is based on deception. If your enemy is superior, evade him. If angry, irritate him. If equally matched, fight and if not: split and re-evaluate.","If I am able to determine the enemy\'s dispositions while at the same time I conceal my own, then I can concentrate and he must divide.","He will win who has military capacity and is not interfered with by the sovereign.","He who wishes to fight must first count the cost. When you engage in actual fighting, if victory is long in coming, then men\'s weapons will grow dull and their ardor will be dampened. If you lay siege to a town, you will exhaust your strength.","When you do battle, even if you are winning, if you continue for a long time it will dull your forces and blunt you edge...If you keep your armies out in the field for a long time, your supplies will be insufficient. Transportation of provisions itself consumes 20 times the amount transported.","For them to perceive the advantage of defeating the enemy, they must also have their rewards.","To conquer the enemy without resorting to war is the most desirable. The highest form of generalship is to conquer the enemy by strategy.","He whose ranks are united in purpose will be victorious.","It is said that if you know your enemies and know yourself, you will not be imperiled in a hundred battles; if you do not know your enemies but do know yourself, you will win one and lose one; if you do not know your enemies nor yourself, you will be imperiled in every single battle.","Now the reason the enlightened prince and the wise general conquer the enemy whenever they move and their achievements surpass those of ordinary men is foreknowledge.","When a general, unable to estimate the enemy\'s strength, allows an inferior force to engage a larger one, or hurls a weak detachment against a powerful one, and neglects to place picked soldiers in the front rank, the result must be rout.","And regulation entails organizational effectiveness, a chain of command, and a structure for logistical support.","The ultimate in disposing one\'s troops is to be without ascertainable shape. Then the most penetrating spies cannot pry in nor can the wise lay plans against you.","To maintain an army at a distance causes the people to be impoverished.","Being unconquerable lies with yourself; being conquerable lies with your enemy.","Place your army in deadly peril, and it will survive; plunge it into desperate straits, and it will come off in safety.","In warfare, first lay plans which will ensure victory, and then lead your army to battle; if you will not begin with stratagem but rely on brute strength alone, victory will no longer be assured.","If words of command are not clear and distinct, if orders are not thoroughly understood, the general is to blame. But if his orders are clear, and the soldiers nevertheless disobey, then it is the fault of their officers.","Maneuvering with an army is advantageous; with an undisciplined multitude, most dangerous.","One whose troops repeatedly congregate in small groups here and there, whispering together, has lost the masses. One who frequently grants rewards is in deep distress. One who frequently imposes punishments is in great difficulty. One who is at first excessively brutal and then fears the masses is the pinnacle of stupidity.","Therefore, to estimate the enemy situation and to calculate distances and the degree of difficulty of the terrain so as to control victory are virtues of the superior general.","Hence the saying: One may know how to conquer without being able to do it.","Of all those in the army close to the commander, none is more intimate than the secret agent.","Spies are a most important element in water, because on them depends an army\'s ability to move.","The sovereign must have full knowledge of the activities of the five sorts of agents. This knowledge must come from the double agents, and therefore it is mandatory that they be treated with the utmost liberality.","To perceive victory when it is known to all is not really skilful... It does not take much strength to lift a hair, it does not take sharp eyes to see the sun and moon, it does not take sharp ears to hear the thunderclap.","Carefully study the well-being of your men, and do not overtax them. Concentrate your energy and hoard your strength. Keep your army continually on the move, and devise unfathomable plans.","To see victory only when it is within the ken of the common herd is not the acme of excellence.","If, however, you are indulgent, but unable to make your authority felt; kind-hearted, but unable to enforce your commands; and incapable, moreover, of quelling disorder: then your soldiers must be likened to spoilt children; they are useless for any practical purpose.","Where the army is, prices are high; when prices rise the wealth of the people is exhausted.","If we know that our own men are in a condition to attack, but are unaware that the enemy is not open to attack, we have gone only halfway towards victory. If we know that the enemy is open to attack, but are unaware that our own men are not in a condition to attack, we have gone only halfway towards victory. If we know that the enemy is open to attack, and also know that our men are in a condition to attack, but are unaware that the nature of the ground makes fighting impracticable, we have still gone only halfway towards victory.","Now this foreknowledge cannot be elicited from spirits; it cannot be obtained inductively from experience, nor by any deductive calculation.","We may distinguish six kinds of terrain, to wit: (1) Accessible ground;  (2) entangling ground;  (3) temporising ground;  (4) narrow passes; (5) precipitous heights; (6) positions at a great distance from the enemy.","When he utilizes combined energy, his fighting men become as it were like unto rolling logs or stones. For it is the nature of a log or stone to remain motionless on level ground, and to move when on a slope; if four-cornered, to come to a standstill, but if round-shaped to go rolling down.","Winning Strategists are certain of triumph before seeking a challenge. Losing Strategists are certain to challenge before seeking a triumph.","There are five kinds of incendiary attack: The first is called setting fire to personnel; the second, to stores; the third, to transport vehicles and equipment; the fourth, to munitions; the fifth, to supply installations...In all cases an army must understand the changes induced by the five kinds of incendiary attack, and make use of logistical calculations to address them.","Now a soldier\'s spirit is keenest in the morning; by noonday it has begun to flag; and in the evening, his mind is only on returning to camp.","The relative size of your force as against that of your adversary is by itself of no consequence. What controls is the relative size of your force at the point where you join in battle. You can strike with the few and be many if you strike your adversary in his gaps. Seek out places where the defense is not strict, the place not tightly guarded, the generals weak, the troops disorderly, the supplies are scarce and the forces are isolated.","It is the rule in war, if our forces are ten to the enemy\'s one, to surround him; if five to one, to attack him; if twice as numerous, to divide our army into two.","A clever general... avoids an army when its spirit is keen, but attacks it when it is sluggish and inclined to return. This is the art of studying moods. Disciplined and calm, he awaits the appearance of disorder and hubbub among the enemy. This is the art of retaining self-possession.","When campaigning, be swift as the wind; in leisurely march, majestic as the forest; in raiding and plundering, like fire; in standing, firm as the mountains. As unfathomable as the clouds, move like a thunderbolt.","Bestow rewards without regard to rule, issue orders without regard to previous arrangements; and you will be able to handle a whole army as though you had to do with but a single man.","Victory is the main object in war.","Apparent confusion is a product of good order; apparent cowardice, of courage; apparent weakness, of strength.","If I determine the enemy\'s disposition of forces while I have no perceptible form, I can concentrate my forces while the enemy is fragmented. The pinnacle of military deployment approaches the formless: if it is formless, then even the deepest spy cannot discern it nor the wise make plans against it.","Thus, though I have heard of successful military operations that were clumsy but swift, cleverness has never been seen associated with long delays.","He must be able to mystify his officers and men by false reports and appearances, and thus keep them in total ignorance.","When envoys are sent with compliments in their mouths, it is a sign that the enemy wishes for a truce. If the enemy\'s troops march up angrily and remain facing ours for a long time without either joining battle or removing demands, the situation is one that requires great vigilance and circumspection. To begin by bluster, but afterward to take fright at the enemy\'s numbers, shows a supreme lack of intelligence.","Bestow rewards without respect to customary practice; publish orders without respect to precedent. Thus you may employ the entire army as you would one man.","Now an army is exposed to six several calamities, not arising from natural causes, 1 but from faults for which the general is responsible. These are: (1) Flight; (2) insubordination; (3) collapse; (4) ruin; (5) disorganisation; (6) rout.","So in war, the way is to avoid what is strong and to strike at what is weak. Water shapes its course according to the nature of the ground over which it flows; the soldier works out his victory in relation to the foe whom he is facing.","Subjugating the enemy\'s army without fighting is the true pinnacle of excellence.","The Art of War is self-explanatory","The rising of birds in their flight is the sign of an ambuscade. Startled beasts indicate that a sudden attack is coming.","Peace proposals unaccompanied by a sworn covenant indicate a plot.","Know thy self, know thy enemy.","In executing an Artful Strategy: When ten times greater, surround them; When five times greater, attack them; When two times greater, scatter them. If the opponent is ready to challenge: When fewer in number, be ready to evade them; When unequal to the match, be ready to avoid them. Even when the smaller opponents have a strong position, the larger opponent will capture them.","Those skilled in attack move as from above the nine-fold heavens. Thus they are capable both of protecting themselves and of gaining complete victory.","No nation has ever benefited from a prolonged war.","When the soldiers stand leaning on their spears, they are faint from want of food.","The best victory is when the opponent surrenders of its own accord before there are any actual hostilities...It is best to win without fighting.","Generally in war the best policy is to take a state intact; to ruin it is inferior to this.","Rapidity is the essence of war.","In all fighting, the direct method may be used for joining battle, but indirect methods will be needed in order to secure victory. Indirect tactics, efficiently applied, are inexhaustible as Heaven and Earth, unending as the flow of rivers and streams; like the sun and moon, they end but to begin anew; like the four seasons, they pass away to return once more.","There are not more than five primary colours, yet in combination they produce more hues than can ever been seen.","Hence that general is skilful in attack whose opponent does not know what to defend; and he is skilful in defense whose opponent does not know what to attack.","These are six ways of courting defeat,  which must be carefully noted by the general who has attained a responsible post.","War is a matter of vital importance to the state.","From a position of this sort, if the enemy is unprepared, you may sally forth and defeat him. But if the enemy is prepared for your coming, and you fail to defeat him, then, return being impossible, disaster will ensue.","When the position is such that neither side will gain by making the first move, it is called temporising ground.","When envoys are sent with compliments in their mouths, it is a sign that the enemy wishes for a truce.","The one who figures on victory at headquarters before even doing battle is the one who has the most strategic factors on his side.","If our soldiers are not overburdened with money, it is not because they have a distaste for riches; if their lives are not unduly long, it is not because they are disinclined to longevity.","Hence the saying: If you know the enemy and you know yourself, your victory will not stand in doubt; if you now Heaven and you know Earth, you may make your victory complete.","According to my assessment, even if you have many more troops than others, how can that help you to victory?","Let your plans be dark and impenetrable as night, and when you move, fall like a thunderbolt.","Supreme excellence consists of breaking the enemy\'s resistance without fighting.","All warfare is based on deception. Hence, when we are able to attack, we must seem unable; when using our forces, we must appear inactive; when we are near, we must make the enemy believe we are far away; when far away, we must make him believe we are near.","In the midst of chaos, there is also opportunity","Victorious warriors win first and then go to war, while defeated warriors go to war first and then seek to win","If your enemy is secure at all points, be prepared for him. If he is in superior strength, evade him. If your opponent is temperamental, seek to irritate him. Pretend to be weak, that he may grow arrogant. If he is taking his ease, give him no rest. If his forces are united, separate them. If sovereign and subject are in accord, put division between them. Attack him where he is unprepared, appear where you are not expected .","Engage people with what they expect; it is what they are able to discern and confirms their projections. It settles them into predictable patterns of response, occupying their minds while you wait for the extraordinary moment \u2014 that which they cannot anticipate.","There is no instance of a nation benefitting from prolonged warfare.","Thus we may know that there are five essentials for victory: 1 He will win who knows when to fight and when not to fight. 2 He will win who knows how to handle both superior and inferior forces.3 He will win whose army is animated by the same spirit throughout all its ranks. 4 He will win who, prepared himself, waits to take the enemy unprepared. 5 He will win who has military capacity and is not interfered with by the sovereign.","Treat your men as you would your own beloved sons. And they will follow you into the deepest valley.","Even the finest sword plunged into salt water will eventually rust.","Move swift as the Wind and closely-formed as the Wood. Attack like the Fire and be still as the Mountain.","There are not more than five musical notes, yet the combinations of these five give rise to more melodies than can ever be heard. There are not more than five primary colours, yet in combinationthey produce more hues than can ever been seen.There are not more than five cardinal tastes, yet combinations ofthem yield more flavours than can ever be tasted.","The art of war is of vital importance to the State. It is a matter of life and death, a road either to safety or to ruin. Hence it is a subject of inquiry which can on no account be neglected.","who wishes to fight must first count the cost","If you wait by the river long enough, the bodies of your enemies will float by.","know yourself and you will win all battles","To win one hundred victories in one hundred battles is not the acme of skill. To subdue the enemy without fighting is the acme of skill.","Be extremely subtle even to the point of formlessness. Be extremely mysterious even to the point of soundlessness. Thereby you can be the director of the opponent\'s fate.","The wise warrior avoids the battle.","The whole secret lies in confusing the enemy, so that he cannot fathom our real intent.","Rouse him, and learn the principle of his activity or inactivity.

The acquaintance of honorable people, even at a distance, does not add flowers in times of warmth and does not change its leaves in times of cold: it continues unfading through the four seasons, becomes increasingly stable as it passes through ease and danger.","15. Thus it is that in war the victorious strategist only seeks battle after the victory has been won, whereas he who is destined to defeat first fights and afterwards looks for victory.","Hiding order beneath the cloak of disorder is simply a question of subdivision; concealing courageunder a show of timidity presupposes a fund of latent energy; masking strength with weakness is tobe effected by tactical dispositions.","Some people think insufficiency means weakness and surplus means strength, but this impression is wrong.","The art of war is the art of deception.","Weapons are inauspicious instruments, not the tools of the enlightened. When there is no choice but to use them, it is best to be calm and free from greed, and not celebrate victory. Those who celebrate victory are bloodthirsty, and the bloodthirsty cannot have their way with the world.","Where there are repeated wars, the people are weakened; when they score repeated victories, rulers become haughty. Let haughty rulers command weakened people, and rare is the nation that will not perish as a result.","By method and discipline are to be understood the marshaling of the army in its proper subdivisions, the graduations of rank among the officers, the maintenance of roads by which supplies may reach the army, and the control of military expenditure.","Stir opponents up, making them respond to you; then you can observe their forms of behavior, and whether they are orderly or confused.","A government should not mobilize an army out of anger, military leaders should not provoke war out of wrath. Act when it is beneficial to do so, desist if not. Anger can revert to joy, wrath can revert to delight, but a nation destroyed cannot be restored to existence, and the dead cannot be restored to life.","Cualquiera que tenga forma puede ser definido, y cualquiera que pueda ser definido puede ser vencido.","El arte de la guerra se basa en el enga\xf1o. Por lo tanto, cuando es capaz de atacar, ha de aparentar incapacidad; cuando las trampas se mueven, aparentar inactividad.","concubines","The general, unable to control his irritation, will launch his men to the assault like swarming ants, with the result that one-third of his men are slain, while the town still remains untaken. Such are the disastrous effects of a siege.","Hence","There is no instance of a country having benefited from prolonged warfare.","7. Hence in the wise leader\'s plans, considerations of advantage and of disadvantage will be blended together.","Attack by Stratagem","Throw your soldiers into positions whence there is no escape, and they will prefer death to flight. If they will face death, there is nothing they may not achieve. Officers and men alike will put forth their uttermost strength. Soldiers in desperate straits lose the sense of fear. If there is no place of refuge, they will stand firm. If they are in the heart of a hostile country, they will show a stubborn front. If there is no help for it, they will fight hard. Thus, without waiting to be marshaled, the soldiers will be constantly on the alert, and without waiting to be asked, they will do your will; without restrictions, they will be faithful; without giving orders, they can be trusted.Prohibit the taking of omens, and do away with superstitious doubts.

Sun Tzu said: In the practical art of war, the best thing of all is to take the enemy\'s country whole and intact; to shatter and destroy it is not so good. So, too, it is better to recapture an army entire than to destroy it, to capture a regiment, a detachment or a company entire than to destroy them. 2. Hence to fight and conquer in all your battles is not supreme excellence; supreme excellence consists in breaking the enemy\'s resistance without fighting.","If you know neither the enemy nor yourself, you will succumb in every battle.","Those skilled in warfare move the enemy, and are not moved by the enemy.","These are: (1)\xa0the Moral Law; (2)\xa0Heaven; (3)\xa0Earth; (4)\xa0the Commander; (5)\xa0method and discipline.","17.\xa0 Thus we may know that there are five essentials for victory: (1) He will win who knows when to fight and when not to fight. [Chang Yu says: If he can fight, he advances and takes the offensive; if he cannot fight, he retreats and remains on the defensive. He will invariably conquer who knows whether it is right to take the offensive or the defensive.] (2) He will win who knows how to handle both superior and inferior forces. [This is not merely the general\u2019s ability to estimate numbers correctly, as Li Ch\u2019uan and others make out. Chang Yu expounds the saying more satisfactorily: \u201cBy applying the art of war, it is possible with a lesser force to defeat a greater, and vice versa. The secret lies in an eye for locality, and in not letting the right moment slip. Thus Wu Tzu says: \u2018With a superior force, make for easy ground; with an inferior one, make for difficult ground.\u2019\\"] (3) He will win whose army is animated by the same spirit throughout all its ranks. (4) He will win who, prepared himself, waits to take the enemy unprepared. (5) He will win who has military capacity and is not interfered with by the sovereign. [Tu Yu quotes Wang Tzu as saying: \u201cIt is the sovereign\u2019s function to give broad instructions, but to decide on battle it is the function of the general. It is needless to dilate on the military disasters which have been caused by undue interference with operations in the field on the part of the home government. Napoleon undoubtedly owed much of his extraordinary success to the fact that he was not hampered by central authority.] 18.\xa0 Hence the saying: If you know the enemy and know yourself, you need not fear the result of a hundred battles. If you know yourself but not the enemy, for every victory gained you will also suffer a defeat.\u201d","prohibit omens altogether. You can best predict your future by controlling it yourself, not by trusting luck or fate to control it.","Put them in a spot where they have no place to go, and they will die before fleeing.","Perhaps the most foundational of these insights is the importance of maintaining an objective emotional detachment when calculating your position relative to your adversary\u2019s. Being ruled by your emotions, exaggerating your strengths, denying your weaknesses, and wishful thinking can only lead to catastrophe. But maintaining your impartiality will allow you to see your circumstances with clarity and will provide opportunities to make sound decisions and respond to changing circumstances appropriately.","He who wishes to fight must first count the cost,","from the ancient Chinese commentators found in the Giles edition. Of these four, Giles\' 1910 edition is the most scholarly and presents the reader an incredible amount of information concerning Sun Tzu\'s text, much more than any other translation. The Giles\' edition of the ART OF WAR, as stated above, was a scholarly work. Dr. Giles was a leading sinologue at the time and an assistant in the Department","There are not more than five musical notes, yet the combination of these five give rise to more melodies that can ever be heard.","When strong, appear weak. Brave, appear fearful. Orderly, appear chaotic. Full, appear empty. Wise, appear foolish. Many, appear to be few. Advancing, appear to retreat. Moving quickly, appear to be slow. Taking, appear to leave. In one place, appear to be in another.","About Sun Tzu himself this is all that Ssu-ma Ch`ien has to tell us in this chapter. But he proceeds to give a biography of his descendant, Sun Pin, born about a hundred years after his famous ancestor\'s death, and also the outstanding military genius of his time.","Know the enemy, know yourself and victory is never in doubt, not in a hundred battles.","To prevent the enemy from fathoming one\u2019s intentions is of the first importance.","Again, if the campaign is protracted, the resources of the State will not be equal to the strain.","The Book of Army Management says: On the field of battle, the spoken word does not carry far enough: hence the institution of gongs and drums. Nor can ordinary objects be seen clearly enough: hence the institution of banners and flags.","as swift as wind, as gentle as forest, as fierce as fire, as unshakable as mountain","You must be swift as the wind, dense as the forest, rapacious as fire, steadfast like a mountain, mysterious as night and mighty as thunder.","The PEOPLE being regarded as the essential part of the State, and FOOD as the people\'s heaven, is it not right that those in authority should value and be careful of both?\\"]","15. Hence a wise general makes a point of foraging on the enemy.

The words of command having been thus explained, he set up the halberds and battle-axes in order to begin the drill. Then, to the sound of drums, he gave the order \u201cRight turn. But the girls only burst out laughing. Sun Tzu said: \u201cIf words of command are not clear and distinct, if orders are not thoroughly understood, then the general is to blame.\u201d","Cien vitorias en cien batallas no es la mayor habilidad. Someter al ej\xe9rcito de los otros sin batalla es la mayor habilidad.","Accordingly, he had the two leaders beheaded, and straightway installed the pair next in order as leaders in their place. When this had been done, the drum was sounded for the drill once more; and the girls went through all the evolutions, turning to the right or to the left, marching ahead or wheeling back, kneeling or standing, with perfect accuracy and precision, not venturing to utter a sound. Then Sun Tzu sent a messenger to the King saying: \u201cYour soldiers, Sire, are now properly drilled and disciplined, and ready for your majesty\'s inspection. They can be put to any use that their sovereign may desire; bid them go through fire and water, and they will not disobey.","practise","Be extremely subtle, even to the point of formlessness.

There are cases where serious offenses are given light penalties; there is inequality before the law, and the innocent are subjected to punishment, even execution. Sometimes serious crimes are pardoned, the strong are supported, and the weak are oppressed. Harsh penalties are applied, unjustly torturing people to get at facts. Sometimes there are officials who condone crime and vice, punishing those who protest against this, cutting off the avenues of appeal and hiding the truth, plundering and ruining lives, unjust and arbitrary. Sometimes there are senior officials who repeatedly change department heads so as to monopolize the government administration, favoring their friends and relatives while treating those they dislike with unjust harshness, oppressive in their actions, prejudiced and unruly. They also use taxation to reap profit, enriching themselves and their families by exactions and fraud. Sometimes local officials extensively tailor awards and fines, welfare projects, and general expenditures, arbitrarily determining prices and measures, with the result that people lose their jobs. These five things are harmful to the people, and anyone who does any of these should be dismissed from office.","If he is secure at all points, be prepared for him.

[Sun Tzu, as a practical soldier, will have none of the \u201cbookish theoric. He cautions us here not to pin our faith to abstract principles; \u201cfor,\u201d as Chang Yu puts it, \u201cwhile the main laws of strategy can be stated clearly enough for the benefit of all and sundry, you must be guided by the actions of the enemy in attempting to secure a favorable position in actual warfare.\u201d On the eve of the battle of Waterloo, Lord Uxbridge, commanding the cavalry, went to the Duke of Wellington in order to learn what his plans and calculations were for the morrow, because, as he explained, he might suddenly find himself Commander-in-chief and would be unable to frame new plans in a critical moment. The Duke listened quietly and then said: \u201cWho will attack the first tomorrow\u2014I or Bonaparte?\u201d \u201cBonaparte,\u201d replied Lord Uxbridge. \u201cWell,\u201d continued the Duke, \u201cBonaparte has not given me any idea of his projects; and as my plans will depend upon his, how can you expect me to tell you what mine are?\u201d75] 18.\xa0 All warfare is based on deception. [The truth of this pithy and profound saying will be admitted by every soldier. Col. Henderson tells us that Wellington, great in so many military qualities, was especially distinguished by \u201cthe extraordinary skill with which he concealed his movements and deceived both friend and foe.\u201d] 19.\xa0\u201d","It is unlucky to be stubborn in the face of insurmountable odds","The difficulty of tactical maneuvering consists in turning the devious into the direct, and misfortune into gain. [This sentence contains one of those highly condensed and somewhat enigmatical expressions of which Sun Tzu is so fond. This is how it is explained by Ts\u2019ao Kung: \u201cMake it appear that you are a long way off, then cover the distance rapidly and arrive on the scene before your opponent. Tu Mu says: \u201cHoodwink the enemy, so that he may be remiss and leisurely while you are dashing along with utmost speed.\u201d Ho Shih gives a slightly different turn: \u201cAlthough you may have difficult ground to traverse and natural obstacles to encounter this is a drawback which can be turned into actual advantage by celerity of movement.\u201d Signal examples of this saying are afforded by the two famous passages across the Alps\u2014that of Hannibal, which laid Italy at his mercy, and that of Napoleon two thousand years later, which resulted in the great victory of Marengo.] 4.\xa0 \xa0 Thus, to take a long and circuitous route, after enticing the enemy out of the way, and though starting after him, to contrive to reach the goal before him, shows knowledge of the artifice of DEVIATION.\u201d","[Li Ch\u2019uan cites the case of Fu Chien, prince of Ch\u2019in, who in 383 A.D. marched with a vast army against the Chin Emperor. When warned not to despise an enemy who could command the services of such men as Hsieh An and Huan Ch\u2019ung, he boastfully replied: \u201cI have the population of eight provinces at my back, infantry and horsemen to the number of one million; why, they could dam up the Yangtsze River itself by merely throwing their whips into the stream. What danger have I to fear? Nevertheless, his forces were soon after disastrously routed at the Fei River, and he was obliged to beat a hasty retreat.] If you know neither the enemy nor yourself, you will succumb in every battle. [Chang Yu said: \u201cKnowing the enemy enables you to take the offensive, knowing yourself enables you to stand on the defensive.\u201d He adds: \u201cAttack is the secret of defense; defense is the planning of an attack.\u201d It would be hard to find a better epitome of the root-principle of war.]\u201d","Asked if an army can be made to imitate the SHUAI-JAN, I should answer, Yes. For the men of Wu and the men of Yueh are enemies; yet if they are crossing a river in the same boat and are caught by a storm, they will come to each other\'s assistance just as the left hand helps the right.","The whole secret lies in confusing the enemy, so that he cannot fathom our real intent.\u2019 To put it perhaps a little more clearly: any attack or other operation is CHENG, on which the enemy has had his attention fixed; whereas that is CH\u2019I,\u201d which takes him by surprise or comes from an unexpected quarter. If the enemy perceives a movement which is meant to be CH\u2019I,\u201d it immediately becomes CHENG.\u201d] 4.\xa0 \xa0 That the impact of your army may be like a grindstone dashed against an egg\u2014 this is effected by the science of weak points and strong. 5.\xa0 \xa0 In all fighting, the direct method may be used for joining battle, but indirect methods will be needed in order to secure victory. [Chang Yu says: \u201cSteadily develop indirect tactics, either by pounding the enemy\u2019s flanks or falling on his rear.\u201d A brilliant example of \u201cindirect tactics\u201d which decided the fortunes of a campaign was Lord Roberts\u2019 night march round the Peiwar Kotal in the second Afghan war.76 6.\xa0 \xa0 Indirect tactics, efficiently applied, are inexhausible as Heaven and Earth, unending as the flow of rivers and streams; like the sun and moon, they end but to begin anew; like the four seasons, they pass away to return once more. [Tu Yu and Chang Yu understand this of the permutations of CH\u2019I and CHENG.\u201d But at present Sun Tzu is not speaking of CHENG at all, unless, indeed, we suppose with Cheng Yu-hsien that a clause relating to it has fallen out of the text. Of course, as has already been pointed out, the two are so inextricably interwoven in all military operations, that they cannot really be considered apart. Here we simply have an expression, in figurative language, of the almost infinite resource of a great leader.] 7.\xa0 \xa0 There are not more than five musical notes, yet the combinations of these five give rise to more melodies than can ever be heard. 8.\xa0 \xa0 There are not more than five primary colors (blue, yellow, red, white, and black), yet in combination they produce more hues than can ever been seen. 9.\xa0 \xa0 There are\u201d","The host thus forming a single united body, is it impossible either for the brave to advance alone, or for the cowardly to retreat alone","Hence the saying: If you know the enemy and know yourself, you need not fear the result of a hundred battles. If you know yourself but not the enemy, for every victory gained you will also suffer a defeat. If you know neither the enemy nor yourself, you will succumb in every battle.","If you wish to feign confusion in order to lure the enemy on, you must first have perfect discipline; if you wish to display timidity in order to entrap the enemy, you must have extreme courage; if you wish to parade your weakness in order to make the enemy over-confident, you must have exceeding strength.] 18.\xa0 Hiding order beneath the cloak of disorder is simply a question of subdivision; [See supra, ss. 1.] concealing courage under a show of timidity presupposes a fund of latent energy; [The commentators strongly understand a certain Chinese word here differently than anywhere else in this chapter. Thus Tu Mu says: \u201cseeing that we are favorably circumstanced and yet make no move, the enemy will believe that we are really afraid.\u201d] masking strength with weakness is to be effected by tactical dispositions.\u201d","see the sun and moon is no sign of sharp sight; to hear the noise of thunder is no sign of a quick ear.","8.\xa0 \xa0 Hence that general is skillful in attack whose opponent does not know what to defend; and he is skillful in defense whose opponent does not know what to attack. [An aphorism which puts the whole art of war in a nutshell.]","12.\xa0 If we do not wish to fight, we can prevent the enemy from engaging us even though the lines of our encampment be merely traced out on the ground. All we need do is to throw something odd and unaccountable in his way. [This extremely concise expression is intelligibly paraphrased by Chia Lin: \u201ceven though we have constructed neither wall nor ditch. Li Ch\u2019uan says: \u201cwe puzzle him by strange and unusual dispositions;\u201d and Tu Mu finally clinches the meaning by three illustrative anecdotes\u2014one of Chu-ko Liang, who when occupying Yang-p\u2019ing and about to be attacked by Ssu-ma I, suddenly struck his colors, stopped the beating of the drums, and flung open the city gates, showing only a few men engaged in sweeping and sprinkling the ground. This unexpected proceeding had the intended effect; for Ssu-ma I, suspecting an ambush, actually drew off his army and retreated. What Sun Tzu is advocating here, therefore, is nothing more nor less than the timely use of \u201cbluff.\u201d]\u201d","Invincibility is in oneself, vulnerability in the opponent.","When your strategy is deep and far-reaching, then what you gain by your calculations is much, so you can win before you even fight. When your strategic thinking is shallow and nearsighted, then what you gain by your calculations is little, so you lose before you do battle. Much strategy prevails over little strategy, so those with no strategy cannot but be defeated. Therefore it is said that victorious warriers win first and then go to war, while defeated warriors go to war first and then seek to win.","Anger may in time change to gladness; vexation may be succeeded by content. 21. But a kingdom that has once been destroyed can never come again into being; nor can the dead ever be brought back to life. 22.

This is the way to keep a country at peace and an army intact.","while the main laws of strategy can be stated clearly enough for the benefit of all and sundry, you must be guided by the actions of the enemy in attempting to secure a favorable position in actual warfare.","practice dissimulation, and you will succeed.","Those who win every battle are not really skillful\u2014those who render others\u2019 armies helpless without fighting are the best of all.","Hence to fight and conquer in all your battles is not supreme excellence; supreme excellence consists in breaking the enemy\'s resistance without fighting. 3.","La milicia es un Tao de enga\xf1os:De modo que cuando seas capaz, muestra incapacidad.

By kindness one can be brave, by frugality one can reach out, and by not presuming to take precedence one can survive effectively. If one gives up kindness and courage, gives up frugality and breadth, and gives up humility for aggressiveness, one will die. The exercise of kindness in battle leads to victory, the exercise of kindness in defense leads to security.","It is a matter of life and death, a road either to safety or to ruin. Hence it is a subject of inquiry which can on no account be neglected. 3.\xa0 \xa0 The art of war, then, is governed by five constant factors, to be taken into account in one\u2019s deliberations, when seeking to determine the conditions obtaining in the field. 4.\xa0 \xa0 These are: (1) The Moral Law; (2) Heaven; (3) Earth; (4) The Commander; (5) Method and discipline.","If equally matched, we can offer battle; if slightly inferior in numbers, we can avoid the enemy; if quite unequal in every way, we can flee from him.","an angry man can later become happy, a resentful man can become pleased, but a kingdom once destroyed can never be restored nor the dead brought back to life","6.\xa0 \xa0 There is no instance of a country having benefited from prolonged warfare. 7.\xa0 \xa0 It is only one who is thoroughly acquainted with the evils of war that can thoroughly understand the profitable way of carrying it on. [That is, with rapidity. Only one who knows the disastrous effects of a long war can realize the supreme importance of rapidity in bringing it to a close. Only","All warfare is based on deception. Therefore, when capable, pretend to be incapable; when active, inactive; when near, make the enemy believe that you are far away; when far away; that you are near.","Therefore, the skillful commander imposes his will on the enemy by making the enemy come to him instead of being brought to the enemy.","8.\xa0 \xa0 The skillful soldier does not raise a second levy, neither are his supply-wagons loaded more than twice. [Once war is declared, he will","When you start a fire, be to windward of it. Do not attack from the leeward.","By discovering the enemy\u2019s dispositions and remaining invisible ourselves, we can keep our forces concentrated, while the enemy\u2019s must be divided.","28.\xa0 Do not repeat the tactics which have gained you one victory, but let your methods be regulated by the infinite variety of circumstances. [As Wang Hsi sagely remarks: \u201cThere is but one root-principle underlying victory, but the tactics which lead up to it are infinite in number. With this compare Col. Henderson: \u201cThe rules of strategy are few and simple. They may be learned in a week. They may be taught by familiar illustrations or a dozen diagrams. But such knowledge will no more teach a man to lead an army like Napoleon than a knowledge of grammar will teach him to write like Gibbon.\u201d] 29.\xa0 Military tactics are like unto water; for water in its natural course runs away from high places and hastens downwards. 30.\xa0 So in war, the way is to avoid what is strong and to strike at what is weak. [Like water, taking the line of least resistance.] 31.\xa0 Water shapes its course according to the nature of the ground over which it flows; the soldier works out his victory in relation to the foe whom he is facing. 32.\xa0 Therefore, just as water retains no constant shape, so in warfare there are no constant conditions. 33.\xa0 He who can modify his tactics in relation to his opponent and thereby succeed in winning, may be called a heaven-born captain. 34.\xa0 The five elements (water, fire, wood, metal, earth) are not always equally predominant; [That is, as Wang Hsi says: \u201cthey predominate alternately.\u201d] the four seasons make way for each other in turn. [Literally, \u201chave no invariable seat.\u201d] There are short days and long; the moon has its periods of waning and waxing. [Cf. V. ss. 6. The purport of the passage is simply to illustrate the want of fixity in war by the changes constantly taking place in Nature. The comparison is not very happy, however, because the regularity of the phenomena which Sun Tzu mentions is by no means paralleled in war.]\u201d","War is like a fire - if you do not put it out, it will burn itself out.","13.\xa0 He wins his battles by making no mistakes. [Ch\u2019en Hao says: \u201cHe plans no superfluous marches, he devises no futile attacks. The connection of ideas is thus explained by Chang Yu: \u201cOne who seeks to conquer by sheer strength, clever though he may be at winning pitched battles, is also liable on occasion to be vanquished; whereas he who can look into the future and discern conditions that are not yet manifest, will never make a blunder and therefore invariably win.\u201d] Making no mistakes is what establishes the certainty of victory, for it means conquering an enemy that is already defeated. 14.\xa0 Hence the skillful fighter puts himself into a position which makes defeat impossible, and does not miss the moment for defeating the enemy. [A \u201ccounsel of perfection\u201d as Tu Mu truly observes. \u201cPosition\u201d need not be confined to the actual ground occupied by the troops. It includes all the arrangements and preparations which a wise general will make to increase the safety of his army.] 15.\xa0 Thus it is that in war the victorious strategist only seeks battle after the victory has been won, whereas he who is destined to defeat first fights and afterwards looks for victory. [Ho Shih thus expounds the paradox: \u201cIn warfare, first lay plans which will ensure victory, and then lead your army to battle; if you will not begin with stratagem but rely on brute strength alone, victory will no longer be assured.\u201d] 16.\xa0 The consummate leader cultivates the moral law, and strictly adheres to method and discipline; thus it is in his power to control success. 17.\xa0 In respect of military method, we have, firstly, Measurement; secondly, Estimation of quantity; thirdly, Calculation; fourthly, Balancing of chances; fifthly, Victory. 18.\xa0 Measurement owes its existence to Earth; Estimation of quantity to Measurement; Calculation to Estimation of quantity; Balancing of chances to Calculation; and Victory to Balancing of chances. [It is not easy to distinguish the four terms very clearly in the Chinese. The\u201d","When you go out the door, be as if you were seeing an enemy. And Shi Li said, \u201cBe prepared, and you will not be defeated.\u201d When\u201d","Knowing the enemy enables you to take the offensive, knowing yourself enables you to stand on the defensive. He adds: \u201cAttack is the secret of defense; defense is the planning of an attack.\u201d It\u201d","1. Sun Tzu said: The art of war recognizes nine varieties of ground: (1) Dispersive ground; (2) Facile ground; (3) Contentious ground; (4) Open ground; (5) Ground of intersecting highways; (6) Serious ground; (7) Difficult ground; (8) Hemmed-in ground; (9) Desperate ground.","10.\xa0 In battle, there are not more than two methods of attack\u2014the direct and the indirect; yet these two in combination give rise to an endless series of maneuvers. 11.\xa0 The direct and the indirect lead on to each other in turn. It is like moving in a circle\u2014you never come to an end. Who can exhaust the possibilities of their combination? 12.\xa0 The onset of troops is like the rush of a torrent which will even roll stones along in its course. 13.\xa0 The quality of decision is like the well-timed swoop of a falcon which enables it to strike and destroy its victim. [The Chinese here is tricky and a certain key word in","Using order to deal with the disorderly, using calm to deal with the clamorous, is mastering the heart.","the Completer and Wu Wang all used spears and battle-axes in order to succor their generation. The SSU-MA FA says: \\"If one man slay another of set purpose, he himself","[The Chinese here is tricky and a certain key word in the context it is used defies the best efforts of the translator. Tu Mu defines this word as \u201cthe measurement or estimation of distance. But this meaning does not quite fit the illustrative simile in ss. 15. Applying this definition to the falcon, it seems to me to denote that instinct of SELF RESTRAINT which keeps the bird from swooping on its quarry until the right moment, together with the power of judging when the right moment has arrived. The analogous quality in soldiers is the highly important one of being able to reserve their fire until the very instant at which it will be most effective. When the \u201cVictory\u201d went into action at Trafalgar at hardly more than drifting pace, she was for several minutes exposed to a storm of shot and shell before replying with a single gun. Nelson coolly waited until he was within close range, when the broadside he brought to bear worked fearful havoc on the enemy\u2019s nearest ships.] 14.\xa0 Therefore the good fighter will be terrible in his onset, and prompt in his decision. [The word \u201cdecision\u201d would have reference to the measurement of distance mentioned above, letting the enemy get near before striking. But I cannot help thinking that Sun Tzu meant to use the word in a figurative sense comparable to our own idiom \u201cshort and sharp.\u201d Cf. Wang Hsi\u2019s note, which after describing the falcon\u2019s mode of attack, proceeds: \u201cThis is just how the \u2018psychological moment\u2019 should be seized in war.\u201d]\u201d","Do not pursue an enemy who simulates flight; do not attack soldiers whose temper is keen.","[Chang Yu relates the following anecdote of Kao Tsu, the first Han Emperor: \u201cWishing to crush the Hsiung-nu, he sent out spies to report on their condition. But the Hsiung-nu, forewarned, carefully concealed all their able-bodied men and well-fed horses, and only allowed infirm soldiers and emaciated cattle to be seen. The result was that spies one and all recommended the Emperor to deliver his attack. Lou Ching alone opposed them, saying: \u201cWhen two countries go to war, they are naturally inclined to make an ostentatious display of their strength. Yet our spies have seen nothing but old age and infirmity. This is surely some ruse on the part of the enemy, and it would be unwise for us to attack. The Emperor, however, disregarding this advice, fell into the trap and found himself surrounded at Po-teng.\u201d] 19.\xa0 Thus one who is skillful at keeping the enemy on the move maintains deceitful appearances, according to which the enemy will act. [Ts\u2019ao Kung\u2019s note is \u201cMake a display of weakness and want.\u201d Tu Mu says: \u201cIf our force happens to be superior to the enemy\u2019s, weakness may be simulated in order to lure him on; but if inferior, he must be led to believe that we are strong, in order that he may keep off. In fact, all the enemy\u2019s movements should be determined by the signs that we choose to give him.\u201d Note the following anecdote of Sun Pin, a descendent of Sun Wu: In 341 B.C., the Ch\u2019i State being at war with Wei, sent T\u2019ien Chi and Sun Pin against the general P\u2019ang Chuan, who happened to be a deadly personal enemy of the later. Sun Pin said: \u201cThe Ch\u2019i State has a reputation for cowardice, and therefore our adversary despises us. Let us turn this circumstance to account.\u201d Accordingly, when the army had crossed the border into Wei territory, he gave orders to show 100,000 fires on the first night, 50,000 on the next, and the night after only 20,000. P\u2019ang Chuan pursued them hotly, saying to himself: \u201cI knew these men of Ch\u2019i were cowards: their numbers have already fallen away by more than half.\u201d In his retreat, Sun Pin came to a narrow defile, with he calculated that his pursuers would reach after dark. Here he had a tree stripped of its bark, and inscribed upon it the words: \u201cUnder this tree shall P\u2019ang Chuan die.\u201d Then, as night began to fall, he placed a strong body of archers in ambush near by, with orders to shoot directly they saw a light. Later on, P\u2019ang Chuan arrived at the spot, and noticing the tree, struck a light in order to read what was written on it. His body was immediately riddled by a volley of arrows, and his whole army thrown into confusion. [The above is Tu Mu\u2019s version of the story; the SHIH CHI, less dramatically but probably with more historical truth, makes P\u2019ang Chuan cut his own throat with an exclamation of despair, after the rout of his army.] ] He sacrifices something, that the enemy may snatch at it. 20.\xa0 By holding out baits, he keeps him on the march; then with a body of picked men he lies in wait for him. [With an emendation suggested by Li Ching, this then reads, \u201cHe lies in wait with the main body of his troops.\u201d] 21.\xa0 The clever combatant looks to the effect of combined energy, and does not require too much from individuals.\u201d","Their action and inaction are matters of strategy, and they cannot be pleased or angered.","Flexibility in our lives means having a fundamental ability to relate to any new environment and excel in it. Instead of fighting it, you greet it with open arms and observe it; instead of criticizing it, you caress it and understand it; instead of ignoring it, you make it yours and be one with it.","Thus, though we have heard of stupid haste in war, cleverness has never been seen associated with long delays. In all history, there is no instance of a country having benefited from prolonged warfare.","If rewards are immoderate, there will be expenditure that does not result in gratitude; if punishments are immoderate, there will be slaughter that does not result in awe.","Now in order to kill the enemy, our men must be roused to anger; that there may be advantage from defeating the enemy, they must have their rewards.

Spies are a most important element in water, because on them depends an army\u2019s ability to move.","It is essential to seek out enemy agents who have come to conduct espionage against you and to bribe them to serve you. Give them instructions and care for them. Thus doubled agents are recruited and used. It is by means of the doubled agent that native and inside agents can be recruited and employed. This is because the doubled agent knows those of his own countrymen who are covetous as well as those officials who have been remiss in office. These we can tempt into our service.And it is by this means that the expendable agent, armed with false information, can be sent to convey it to the enemy. It is because doubled agents know in what respects the enemy can be deceived that expendable agents may be sent to convey false information. It is by this means also that living agents can be used at appropriate times. The sovereign must have full knowledge of the activities of the five sorts of agents. This knowledge must come from the doubled agents, and therefore it is mandatory that they be treated with the utmost liberality.And therefore only the enlightened sovereign and the worthy general who are able to use the most intelligent people as agents are certain to achieve great things.","Secret operations are essential in war; upon them the army relies to make its every move. An army without secret agents is exactly like a man without eyes or ears.","Ban all omen-taking and superstitious practices so that death is all they have to worry about.","Hence a wise general makes a point of foraging on the enemy.","Invincible is the soldier who hath his desire and returneth homewards. A\u201d","All men can see the individual tactics necessary to conquer, but almost no one can see the strategy out of which total victory is evolved.","Therefore soldiers must be treated in the first instance with humanity, but kept under control by means of iron discipline. This is a certain road to victory.","instance","If you know neither the enemy nor yourself, you will succumb in every battle. [Chang Yu said: \u201cKnowing the enemy enables you to take the offensive, knowing yourself enables you to stand on the defensive.","If you govern a country by listening to the arguments of a multitude of people, the country will be in danger in no time at all. How do we know this is so?

Using bells and drums is a means of unifying ears; making law and order uniform is a way of unifying minds. When the smart ones can\u2019t be clever and the stupid ones can\u2019t be clumsy, this is a means of unifying a mass.","More planning shall give greater possibility of victory while less planning, lesser possibility of victory. So how about those without planning?","The MORAL LAW causes the people to be in complete accord with their ruler, so that they will follow him regardless of their lives, undismayed by any danger. 7.

For even if the enemy is numerous, I can prevent him from engaging. . . . [I]f he does not know my military situation, I can always make him urgently attend to his own preparations so that he has no leisure to plan to fight me. Therefore, determine the enemy\'s plans and you will know which strategy will be successful and which will not. Agitate him and ascertain the pattern of his movement. Determine his dispositions and so ascertain the field of battle. Probe him and learn where his strength is abundant and where deficient. The ultimate in disposing one\'s troops is to be without ascertainable shape. Then the most penetrating spies cannot pry in nor can the wise lay plans against you. It is according to the shapes that I lay the plans for victory, but the multitude does not comprehend this. Although everyone can see the outward aspects, none understands the way in which I have created victory. Therefore, when I have won a victory I do not repeat my tactics but respond to circumstances in an infinite variety of ways. Now an army may be likened to water, for just as flowing water avoids the heights and hastens to the lowlands, so any army avoids strength and strikes weakness. And as water shapes its flow in accordance with the ground, so an army manages its victory in accordance with the situation of the enemy. And as water has no constant form, there are in war no constant conditions. Thus, one able to gain the victory by modifying his tactics in accordance with the enemy situation may be said to be divine. Of the five elements, none is always predominant: of the four seasons, none lasts forever; of the days, some are long and some short, and the moon waxes and wanes.","Donde hay grandes recompensas hay hombres valientes","N\'employer pour vaincre que la voie des si\xe8ges et des batailles, c\'est ignorer \xe9galement et les devoirs de souverain et ceux de g\xe9n\xe9ral ; c\'est ne pas savoir gouverner ; c\'est ne pas savoir servir \xc9tat","Un viento diurno cesar\xe1 al anochecer, un viento nocturno cesar\xe1 al amanecer.","Si vous r\xe9pandez l\'argent \xe0 pleines mains, si vous traitez bien tout le monde, si vous emp\xeachez que vos soldats ne fassent le moindre d\xe9g\xe2t dans les endroits par o\xf9 ils passeront, si les peuples vaincus ne souffrent aucun dommage, assurez-vous qu\'ils sont d\xe9j\xe0 gagn\xe9s, et que le bien qu\'ils diront de vous attirera plus de sujets \xe0 votre ma\xeetre et plus de villes sous sa domination que les plus brillantes victoires.","Punissez s\xe9v\xe8rement, r\xe9compensez avec largesse","Do not interfere with an army that is returning home because a man whose heart is set on returning home will fight to the death against any attempt to bar his way, and is therefore too dangerous an opponent to be tackled.","18.

Pretend inferiority and encourage his arrogance. Keep him under a strain and wear him down. When he is united, divide him. Attack where he is unprepared; sally out when he does not expect you. These are the strategist\'s keys to victory. It is not possible to discuss them beforehand. now if the estimates made in the temple before hostilities indicate victory it is because calculations show one\'s strength to be superior to that of his enemy; if they indicate defeat, it is because calculations show that one is inferior.

He does not consider difficulties.If he has too delicate a sense of honor you can calumniate him.

When his troops lean on their weapons, they are famished. When drawers of water drink before carrying it to camp, his troops are suffering from thirst. When the enemy sees an advantage but does not advance to seize it, he is fatigued. When birds gather above his camp sites, they are empty. When at night the enemy\'s camp is clamorous, he is fearful. They are boisterous to reassure themselves. When his troops are disorderly, the general has no prestige. When his flags and banners move about constantly he is in disarray. If the officers are short-tempered they are exhausted. When the enemy feeds grain to the horses and his men meat and when his troops neither hang up their cooking pots nor return to their shelters, the enemy is desperate. When the troops continually gather in small groups and whisper together the general has lost the confidence of the army. Too frequent rewards indicate that the general is at the end of his resources; too frequent punishments that he is in acute distress. If the officers at first treat the men violently and later are fearful of them, the limit of indiscipline has been reached. When the enemy troops are in high spirits, and, although facing you, do not join battle for a long time, nor leave, you must thoroughly investigate the situation.","- \u0625\u0646 \u0645\u0627 \u064a\u0635\u0644\u062d \u0644\u0644\u062a\u0637\u0628\u064a\u0642 \u0641\u064a \u0627\u0644\u062d\u0631\u0628\u060c \u064a\u0635\u0644\u062d \u0644\u0644\u062a\u0637\u0628\u064a\u0642 \u0641\u064a \u0627\u0644\u062d\u064a\u0627\u0629 \u0627\u0644\u064a\u0648\u0645\u064a\u0629. - \u0639\u0646\u062f\u0645\u0627 \u0646\u0633\u062a\u0639\u062f \u0644\u062f\u0641\u0639 \u0642\u0648\u0627\u062a\u0646\u0627 \u0644\u0644\u062a\u062d\u0631\u0643\u060c \u064a\u062c\u0628 \u0623\u0646 \u0646\u062a\u0638\u0627\u0647\u0631 \u0628\u0627\u0644\u062a\u0643\u0627\u0633\u0644 (\u0648\u0647\u0648 \u0645\u0627 \u062d\u062f\u062b \u0641\u064a \u062d\u0631\u0628 \u0623\u0643\u062a\u0648\u0628\u0631 \u0661\u0669\u0667\u0663 \u0639\u0644\u0649 \u0633\u0628\u064a\u0644 \u0627\u0644\u0645\u062b\u0627\u0644). - \u0639\u062f\u0645 \u0648\u062c\u0648\u062f \u0627\u0644\u0634\u0639\u0631 \u0627\u0644\u0623\u0628\u064a\u0636 \u0644\u064a\u0633 \u062f\u0644\u064a\u0644\u0627 \u0639\u0644\u0649 \u0627\u0644\u0642\u0648\u0629\u060c \u0648\u0631\u0624\u064a\u0629 \u0627\u0644\u0634\u0645\u0633 \u0648\u0627\u0644\u0642\u0645\u0631 \u0644\u0627 \u062a\u0639\u0646\u064a \u062d\u062f\u0629 \u0627\u0644\u0628\u0635\u0631\u060c \u0648\u0633\u0645\u0627\u0639 \u0627\u0644\u0631\u0639\u062f \u0644\u0627 \u064a\u0624\u0643\u062f \u0633\u0644\u0627\u0645\u0629 \u0627\u0644\u0623\u0630\u0646. - \u0627\u0644\u0642\u0631\u0627\u0631 \u0627\u0644\u0623\u0642\u0644 \u0635\u0648\u0627\u0628\u0627 \u0641\u064a \u0648\u0642\u062a \u0627\u0644\u062d\u0627\u062c\u0629 \u0625\u0644\u0649 \u0627\u0644\u062d\u0633\u0645\u060c \u0623\u0635\u0648\u0628 \u0645\u0646 \u0627\u0644\u0642\u0631\u0627\u0631 \u0627\u0644\u0646\u0645\u0648\u0630\u062c\u064a \u0628\u0639\u062f \u0636\u064a\u0627\u0639 \u0627\u0644\u0641\u0631\u0635\u0629. - \u0627\u0644\u062a\u0638\u0627\u0647\u0631 \u0628\u0627\u0644\u0627\u0636\u0637\u0631\u0627\u0628 \u064a\u062a\u0637\u0644\u0628 \u0642\u062f\u0631\u0627 \u0639\u0627\u0644\u064a\u0627 \u0645\u0646 \u0627\u0644\u0646\u0638\u0627\u0645.","Now in order to kill the enemy, our men must be roused to anger; that there may be advantage from defeating the enemy, they must have their rewards.","Los buenos guerreros hacen que los adversarios vengan a ellos y de ning\xfan modo se dejan atraer fuera de su fortaleza.","In war, numbers alone confer no advantage.

In such ground, he who first takes high sunny positions convenient to his supply routes can fight advantageously. Ground easy to get out of but difficult to return to is entrapping. The nature of this ground is such that if the enemy is unprepared and you sally out you may defeat him. If the enemy is prepared and you go out and engage, but do not win, it is difficult to return. This is unprofitable. Ground equally disadvantageous for both the enemy and ourselves to enter is indecisive. The nature of this ground is such that although the enemy holds out a bait I do not go forth but entice him by marching off. When I have drawn out half his force, I can strike him advantageously. If I first occupy constricted ground I must block the passes and await the enemy. If the enemy first occupies such ground and blocks the defiles I should not follow him; if he does not block them completely I may do so. In precipitous ground I must take position on the sunny heights and await the enemy. If he first occupies such ground I lure him by marching off; I do not follow him.When at a distance from an enemy of equal strength it is difficult to provoke battle and unprofitable to engage him in his chosen position. These are the principles relating to six different types of ground. It is the highest responsibility of the general to inquire into them with the utmost care.","los que ganan todas las batallas no son realmente profesionales; los que consiguen que se rindan impotentes los ej\xe9rcitos ajenos sin luchar son los mejores maestros del Arte de la Guerra.","Ciente de tuas capacidades e limita\xe7\xf5es, n\xe3o inicies nenhuma empreitada que n\xe3o possas levar a cabo.","When troops flee, are insubordinate, distressed, collapse in disorder or are routed, it is the fault of the general.

One who wishes to appear to be weak in order to make his enemy arrogant must be extremely strong. Only then can he feign weakness.Order or disorder depends on organization; courage or cowardice on circumstances; strength or weakness on dispositions. When troops gain a favorable situation the coward is brave; if it be lost, the brave become cowards. In the art of war there are no fixed rules. These can only be worked out according to circumstances.Thus, those skilled at making the enemy move do so by creating a situation to which he must conform; they entice him with something he is certain to take, and with lures of ostensible profit they await him in strength. Therefore a skilled commander seeks victory form the situation and does not demand it of his subordinates.","When the general is morally weak and his discipline not strict, when his instructions and guidance are not enlightened, when there are no consistent rules to guide the officers and men and when the formations are slovenly the army is in disorder.","Qu\xe3o lament\xe1vel \xe9 arriscar tudo em um \xfanico combate, negligenciando a estrat\xe9gia vitoriosa, e fazer com que o destino de tuas armas dependa de uma \xfanica batalha!","Confirmation of the ground is of the greatest assistance in battle.

It is suggested that before his interview with Ho Lu, Sun Tzu had only written the 13 chapters, but afterwards composed a sort of exegesis in the form of question and answer between himself and the King. Pi I-hsun, the author of the SUN TZU HSU LU, backs this up with a quotation from the WU YUEH CH`UN CH`IU: \\"The King","The clever combatant looks to the effect of combined energy, and does not require too much from individuals.

And one able to prevent him from coming does so by hurting him.If you are able to hold critical points on his strategic roads the enemy cannot come.

Here officers and men long to return to their nearby homes. When he makes but a shallow penetration into enemy territory he is in frontier ground. Ground equally advantageous for the enemy or me to occupy is key ground. Ground equally accessible to both the enemy and me is communicating. This is level and extensive ground in which one may come and go, sufficient in extent for battle and to erect opposing fortifications. When a state is enclosed by three other states its territory is focal. He who first gets control of it will gain the support of All-under-Heaven. When the army has penetrated deep into hostile territory, leaving far behind many enemy cities and towns, it is in serious ground. When the army traverses mountains, forests, precipitous country, or marches through defiles, marshlands, or swamps, or any place where the going is hard, it is in difficult ground. Ground to which access is constricted, where the way out is tortuous, and where a small enemy force can strike my larger one is called \'encircled.\' Ground in which the army survives only if it fights with the courage of desperation is called \'death.\'Therefore, do not fight in dispersive ground; do not stop in the frontier borderlands. Do not attack an enemy who occupies key ground; in communicating ground do not allow your formations to become separated. In focal ground, ally with neighboring states; in deep ground, plunder. In difficult ground, press on; in encircled ground, devise stratagems; in death ground, fight. In dispersive ground I would unify the determination of the army. In frontier ground I would keep my forces closely linked. In key ground I would hasten up my rear elements. In communicating ground I would pay strict attention to my defenses. In focal ground I would strengthen my alliances. I reward my prospective allies with valuables and silks and bind them with solemn covenants. I abide firmly by the treaties and then my allies will certainly aid me. In serious ground I would ensure a continuous flow of provisions. In difficult ground I would press on over the roads. In encircled ground I would block the points of access and egress. It is military doctrine that an encircling force must leave a gap to show the surrounded troops there is a way out, so that they will not be determined to fight to the death. Then, taking advantage of this, strike. Now, if I am in encircled ground, and the enemy opens a road in order to tempt my troops to take it, I close this means of escape so that my officers and men will have a mind to fight to the death. In death ground I could make it evident that there is no chance of survival. For it is the nature of soldiers to resist when surrounded; to fight to the death when there is no alternative, and when desperate to follow commands implicitly.","When the enemy is at ease, be able to weary him; when well fed, to starve him; when at rest, to make him move. Appear at places to which he must hasten; move swiftly where he does not expect you. That you may march a thousand li without wearying yourself is because you travel where there is no enemy. Go into emptiness, strike voids, bypass what he defends, hit him where he does not expect you.To be certain to take what you attack is to attack a place the enemy does not protect. To be certain to hold what you defend is to defend a place the enemy does not attack. Therefore, against those skilled in attack, an enemy does not know where to defend; against the experts in defense, the enemy does not know where to attack. Subtle and insubstantial, the expert leaves no trace; divinely mysterious, he is inaudible. Thus he is master of his enemy\'s fate.","latter accretions are not to be considered part of the original work.

Courses of action previously followed and old plans previously executed must be altered. He alters his campsites and marches by devious routes, and thus makes it impossible for others to anticipate his purpose. To assemble the army and throw it into a desperate position is the business of the general. He leads the army deep into hostile territory and there releases the trigger. He burns his boats and smashes his cooking pots; he urges the army on as if driving a flock of sheep, now in one direction, now in another, and none knows where he is going.

Inside agents are enemy officials whom we employ. Among the official class there are worthy men who have been deprived of office; others who have committed errors and have been punished. There are sycophants and minions who are covetous of wealth. There are those who wrongly remain long in lowly office; those who have not obtained responsible positions, and those whose sole desire is to take advantage of times of trouble to extend the scope of their own abilities. There are those who are two-faced, changeable, and deceitful, and who are always sitting on the fence. As far as all such are concerned you can secretly inquire after their welfare, reward them liberally with gold and silk, and so tie them to you. Then you may rely on them to seek out the real facts of the situation in their country, and to ascertain its plans directed against you. They can as well create cleavages between the sovereign and his ministers so that these are not in harmonious accord.Doubled agents are enemy spies whom we employ. When the enemy sends spies to pry into my accomplishments or lack of them, I bribe them lavishly, turn them around, and make them my agents.Expendable agents are those of our own spies who are deliberately given fabricated information. We leak information which is actually false and allow our own agents to learn it. When these agents operating in enemy territory are taken by him they are certain to report this false information. The enemy will believe it and make preparations accordingly. But our actions will of course not accord with this, and the enemy will put the spies to death.
