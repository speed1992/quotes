He is often called England\'s national poet and the \\"Bard of Avon\\" (or simply \\"The Bard\\"). His surviving works consist of 38 plays, 154 sonnets, two long narrative poems, and several other poems. His plays have been translated into every major living language, and are performed more often than those of any other playwright. Shakespeare was born and raised in Stratford-upon-Avon. At the age of 18 he married Anne Hathaway, who bore him three children: Susanna, and twins Hamnet and Judith. Between 1585 and 1592 he began a successful career in London as an actor, writer, and part owner of the playing company the Lord Chamberlain\'s Men, later known as the King\'s Men. He appears to have retired to Stratford around 1613, where he died three years later. Few records of Shakespeare\'s private life survive, and there has been considerable speculation about such matters as his sexuality, religious beliefs, and whether the works attributed to him were written by others. Shakespeare produced most of his known work between 1590 and 1613. His early plays were mainly comedies and histories, genres he raised to the peak of sophistication and artistry by the end of the sixteenth century. Next he wrote mainly tragedies until about 1608, including Hamlet, King Lear, and Macbeth, considered some of the finest examples in the English language. In his last phase, he wrote tragicomedies, also known as romances, and collaborated with other playwrights. Many of his plays were published in editions of varying quality and accuracy during his lifetime, and in 1623 two of his former theatrical colleagues published the First Folio, a collected edition of his dramatic works that included all but two of the plays now recognised as Shakespeare\'s. Shakespeare was a respected poet and playwright in his own day, but his reputation did not rise to its present heights until the nineteenth century. The Romantics, in particular, acclaimed Shakespeare\'s genius, and the Victorians hero-worshipped Shakespeare with a reverence that George Bernard Shaw called \\"bardolatry\\". In the twentieth century, his work was repeatedly adopted and rediscovered by new movements in scholarship and performance. His plays remain highly popular today and are consistently performed and reinterpreted in diverse cultural and political contexts throughout the world.

That inward beauty and invisible;Or were I deaf, thy outward parts would move each part in me that were but sensible: Though neither eyes nor ears, to hear nor see, yet should I be in love by touching thee.\'Say, that the sense of feeling were bereft me, and that I could not see, nor hear, nor touch, and nothing but the very smell were left me, yet would my love to thee be still as much; for from the stillitory of thy face excelling comes breath perfum\'d that breedeth love by smelling.","I do believe you think what now you speak, but what we do determine oft we break. Purpose is but the slave to memory, of violent birth, but poor validity, which now, like fruit unripe, sticks on the tree, but fall, unshaken, when they mellow be. Most unnecessary \'tis that we forget to pay ourselves what to ourselves is debt. What to ourselves in passion we propose, the passion ending, doth the purpose lose. The violence of either grief or joy their own enactures with themselves destroy. Where joy most revels, grief doth most lament. Grief joys, joy grieves on slender accident. This world is not for aye, nor \'tis not strange that even our loves should with our fortunes change. For \'tis a question left us yet to prove, whether love lead fortune, or else fortune love. The great man down, you mark his favorite flies. The poor advanced makes friends of enemies. And hitherto doth love on fortune tend, for who not needs shall never lack a friend, and who in want a hollow friend doth try, directly seasons him his enemy. But, orderly to end where I begun, our wills and fates do so contrary run that our devices still are overthrown. Our thoughts are ours, their ends none of our own. So think thou wilt no second husband wed, but die thy thoughts when thy first lord is dead.","Love is not loveWhich alters when alteration finds,Or bends with the remover to remove:Oh, no, it is an ever-fix\xe8d mark,that looks on tempests and is never shaken.","And as imagination bodies forthThe forms of things unknown, the poet\u2019s penTurns them to shapes and gives to airy nothingA local habitation and a name","Come unto these yellow sands,And then take hands.Curtsied when you have and kissedThe wild waves whist,Foot is featly here and there;And, sweet sprites, the burden bear.Ariel\'s song, scene II, Act I","Oh, she doth teach the torches to burn bright!It seems she hangs upon the cheek of nightLike a rich jewel in an Ethiope\u2019s ear,Beauty too rich for use, for earth too dear.So shows a snowy dove trooping with crowsAs yonder lady o\'er her fellows shows.The measure done, I\u2019ll watch her place of stand,And, touching hers, make bless\xe8d my rude hand.Did my heart love till now? Forswear it, sight!For I ne\'er saw true beauty till this night.*Oh, she shows the torches how to burn bright! She stands out against the darkness like a jeweled earring hanging against the cheek of an African. Her beauty is too good for this world; she\u2019s too beautiful to die and be buried. She outshines the other women like a white dove in the middle of a flock of crows. When this dance is over, I\u2019ll see where she stands, and then I\u2019ll touch her hand with my rough and ugly one. Did my heart ever love anyone before this moment? My eyes were liars, then, because I never saw true beauty before tonight.*","Sin from thy lips? O trespass sweetly urged!Give me my sin again.","Totus mundus agit histrionem. (All the World\'s a Stage.)\\"[Motto of William Shakespeare\'s Globe Theatre (f. 1599) and its acting company, The King\'s Men; taken from the first play to be performed on the new stage.]","When remedies are past, the griefs are endedBy seeing the worst, which late on hopes depended.To mourn a mischief that is past and goneIs the next way to draw new mischief on.What cannot be preserved when fortune takes,Patience her injury a mockery makes.The robb\'d that smiles steals something for the thief;He robs himself that spends a bootless grief.","Grief fills the room up of my absent child,Lies in his bed, walks up and down with me,Puts on his pretty look, repeats his words,Remembers me of his gracious parts,Stuffs out his vacant garments with his form","for Mercutio\'s soulIs but a little way above our heads,Staying for thine to keep him company:Either thou, or I, or both, must go with him.","Now my charms are all o\'erthrown,And what strength I have\'s mine own, -Which is most faint: now, \'tis true,I must be here confined by you...But release me from my bandsWith the help of your good hands:Gentle breath of yours my sailsMust fill, or else my project fails,Which was to please: now I wantSpirits to enforce, art to enchant;And my ending is despair,Unless I be relieved by prayer,Which pierces so, that it assaultsMercy itself, and frees all faults.As you from crimes would pardon\'d be,Let your indulgence set me free.","Love all, trust a few.","When I do count the clock that tells the time,And see the brave day sunk in hideous night;When I behold the violet past prime,And sable curls all silver\'d o\'er with white;When lofty trees I see barren of leavesWhich erst from heat did canopy the herd,And summer\'s green all girded up in sheavesBorne on the bier with white and bristly beard,Then of thy beauty do I question make,That thou among the wastes of time must go,Since sweets and beauties do themselves forsakeAnd die as fast as they see others grow;And nothing \'gainst Time\'s scythe can make defenceSave breed, to brave him when he takes thee hence.","Let it be virtuous to be obstinate.","Fool:\\"He\'s mad that trusts in the tameness of a wolf, a

He is often called England\'s national poet and the \\"Bard of Avon\\" (or simply \\"The Bard\\"). His surviving works consist of 38 plays, 154 sonnets, two long narrative poems, and several other poems. His plays have been translated into every major living language, and are performed more often than those of any other playwright. Shakespeare was born and raised in Stratford-upon-Avon. At the age of 18 he married Anne Hathaway, who bore him three children: Susanna, and twins Hamnet and Judith. Between 1585 and 1592 he began a successful career in London as an actor, writer, and part owner of the playing company the Lord Chamberlain\'s Men, later known as the King\'s Men. He appears to have retired to Stratford around 1613, where he died three years later. Few records of Shakespeare\'s private life survive, and there has been considerable speculation about such matters as his sexuality, religious beliefs, and whether the works attributed to him were written by others. Shakespeare produced most of his known work between 1590 and 1613. His early plays were mainly comedies and histories, genres he raised to the peak of sophistication and artistry by the end of the sixteenth century. Next he wrote mainly tragedies until about 1608, including Hamlet, King Lear, and Macbeth, considered some of the finest examples in the English language. In his last phase, he wrote tragicomedies, also known as romances, and collaborated with other playwrights. Many of his plays were published in editions of varying quality and accuracy during his lifetime, and in 1623 two of his former theatrical colleagues published the First Folio, a collected edition of his dramatic works that included all but two of the plays now recognised as Shakespeare\'s. Shakespeare was a respected poet and playwright in his own day, but his reputation did not rise to its present heights until the nineteenth century. The Romantics, in particular, acclaimed Shakespeare\'s genius, and the Victorians hero-worshipped Shakespeare with a reverence that George Bernard Shaw called \\"bardolatry\\". In the twentieth century, his work was repeatedly adopted and rediscovered by new movements in scholarship and performance. His plays remain highly popular today and are consistently performed and reinterpreted in diverse cultural and political contexts throughout the world.

It is not politic in the commonwealth of nature to preserve virginity. Loss of virginity is rational increase, and there was never virgin got till virginity was first lost. That you were made of is mettel to make virgins. Virginity, by being once lost may be ten times found; by being ever kept it is ever lost. \u2018Tis too cold a companion. Away with \u2018t!There\u2019s little can be said in\u2019t; \u2019tis against the rule of nature. To speak on the part of virginity, is to accuse your mothers; which is most infallible disobedience. He that hangs himself is a virgin; virginity murthers itself, and should be buried in highways out of all sanctified limit, as a desperate offendress against nature. Virginity breeds mites, much like a cheese; consumes itself to the very paring, and so dies with feeding his own stomach. Besides, virginity is peevish, proud, idle, made of self-love which is the most inhibited sin in the canon. Keep it not; you cannot choose but loose by\u2019t. Out with \u2018t! Within the year it will make itself two, which is a goodly increase, and the principal itself not much the worse. Away with \u2018t! Tis a commodity that will lose the gloss with lying; the longer kept, the less worth: off with \u2019t, while \u2019tis vendible; answer the time of request. Virginity, like an old courtier, wears her cap out of fashion; richly suited, but unsuitable: just like the brooch and the toothpick, which wear not now. Your date is better in your pie and your porridge than in your cheek; and your virginity, your old virginity, is like one of our French withered pears: it looks ill, it eats drily.

While most people associate him with his plays, it was his sonnets that likely earned him admiration among his contemporaries. Yes, that\u2019s right: In his lifetime, Shakespeare garnered more acclaim for his sonnets than he did for his plays. In England during the 1590s, writing plays was considered a bit hackish\u2014a way to pay the bills\u2014and not an intellectual pursuit. Writing sonnets was all the rage\u2014 and a way to gain literary prestige. These poems weren\u2019t published for the plebeian public, but were written down and shared among the literati\u2014and aristocrats looking for some intellectual cachet by becoming patrons to brilliant but perhaps financially strapped writers. So, while Shakespeare likely wrote nearly all of his love sonnets in the early to mid 1590s, they weren\u2019t officially collected and published until 1609, well after the fad had passed. W. H. Auden said of Shakespeare\u2019s sonnets: \u201cThey are the work of someone whose ear is unerring. In today\u2019s less poetry-friendly world, appreciation of these sonnets tends, sadly, to be relegated to classrooms, Valentine\u2019s Day, and anniversaries. Which is too bad, because\u2014though they do indeed rhyme\u2014they are far superior to the ditties found in ninety-nine-cent greeting cards. In fact, they cover the whole gamut of love\u2014the good, the bad, the erotic, and the ugly, including love triangles, being dumped, and jealousy. There is also speculation as to how autobiographical the sonnets are. The truth is that we know so little about Shakespeare\u2019s private life.\u201d","Por un extra\xf1o azar la pr\xf3vida Fortuna,que ahora me acompa\xf1a, ha tra\xeddohasta aqu\xed a mis enemigos, y por prescienciaveo que mi cenit depende de un astrosumamente favorable y que, si noaprovecho su influencia, mi suertedecaer\xe1.
