Realize this, and you will find strength.","Everything we hear is an opinion, not a fact. Everything we see is a perspective, not the truth.","It never ceases to amaze me: we all love ourselves more than other people, but care more about their opinions than our own.","The object of life is not to be on the side of the majority, but to escape finding oneself in the ranks of the insane.","The opinion of 10,000 men is of no value if none of them know anything about the subject.","Think of all the years passed by in which you said to yourself \\"I\'ll do it tomorrow,\\" and how the gods have again and again granted you periods of grace of which you have not availed yourself. It is time to realize that you are a member of the Universe, that you are born of Nature itself, and to know that a limit has been set to your time. Use every moment wisely, to perceive your inner refulgence, or \'twill be gone and nevermore within your reach.","If you are distressed by anything external, the pain is not due to the thing itself, but to your estimate of it; and this you have the power to revoke at any moment.","Live a good life. If there are gods and they are just, then they will not care how devout you have been, but will welcome you based on the virtues you have lived by. If there are gods, but unjust, then you should not want to worship them. If there are no gods, then you will be gone, but will have lived a noble life that will live on in the memories of your loved ones.","The things you think about determine the quality of your mind. Your soul takes on the color of your thoughts.","You always own the option of having no opinion. There is never any need to get worked up or to trouble your soul about things you can\'t control. These things are not asking to be judged by you. Leave them alone.","Say to yourself in the early morning: I shall meet today ungrateful, violent, treacherous, envious, uncharitable men. All of these things have come upon them through ignorance of real good and ill... I can neither be harmed by any of them, for no man will involve me in wrong, nor can I be angry with my kinsman or hate him; for we have come into the world to work together.","Whenever you are about to find fault with someone, ask yourself the following question: What fault of mine most nearly resembles the one I am about to criticize?","Do not be wise in words - be wise in deeds.","What does not benefit the hive is no benefit to the bee.","Our anger and annoyance are more detrimental to us than the things themselves which anger or annoy us.","Death smiles at us all, all a man can do is smile back.","There is but one thing of real value - to cultivate truth and justice, and to live without anger in the midst of lying and unjust men.","If someone can prove me wrong and show me my mistake in any thought or action, I shall gladly change. I seek the truth, which never harmed anyone: the harm is to persist in one\'s own self-deception and ignorance.","It is not death that a man should fear, but he should fear never beginning to live.","Adapt yourself to the life you have been given; and truly love the people with whom destiny has surrounded you.","Life is short. Do not forget about the most important things in our life, living for other people and doing good for them.","Give yourself a gift: the present moment.","The inner master, when confronted with an obstacle, uses it as fuel, like a fire which consumes things that are thrown into it. A small lamp would be snuffed out, but a big fire will engulf what is thrown at it and burn hotter; it consumes the obstacle and uses it to reach a higher level.","What we do in life ripples in eternity.","Never let the future disturb you. You will meet it, if you have to, with the same weapons of reason which today arm you against the present.","The happiness of those who want to be popular depends on others; the happiness of those who seek pleasure fluctuates with moods outside their control; but the happiness of the wise grows out of their own free acts.","I\'m going to be meeting with people today who talk too much - people who are selfish, egotistical, ungrateful. But I won\'t be surprised or disturbed, for I can\'t imagine a world without such people.","Do not indulge in dreams of having what you have not, but reckon up the chief of the blessings you do possess, and then thankfully remember how you would crave for them if they were not yours.","Very little is needed to make a happy life; it is all within yourself, in your way of thinking.","Waste no more time arguing what a good man should be. Be one.","The first rule is to keep an untroubled spirit. The second is to look things in the face and know them for what they are.","Whoever values peace of mind and the health of the soul will live the best of all possible lives.","Why should we feel anger at the world? As if the world would notice?","The secret of all victory lies in the organization of the non-obvious.","Most of what we say and do is not essential. If you can eliminate it, you\'ll have more time, and more tranquillity. Ask yourself at every moment, \'Is this necessary?\'","Live your life as if you are ready to say goodbye to it at any moment, as if the time left for you were some pleasant surprise.","The best revenge is not to be like your enemy.","Be tolerant with others and strict with yourself.","Nothing that goes on in anyone else\'s mind can harm you.","Dwell on the beauty of life. Watch the stars, and see yourself running with them.","The impediment to action advances action. What stands in the way becomes the way.","Past and future have no power over you. Just the present - and even that can be minimized.","If it is not right do not do it; if it is not true do not say it.","You have to assemble your life yourself - action by action.","Bear in mind that the measure of a man is the worth of the things he cares about.","A man\'s true greatness lies in the consciousness of an honest purpose in life, founded on a just estimate of himself and everything else, on frequent self-examinations, and a steady obedience to the rule which he knows to be right, without troubling himself about what others may think or say, or whether they do or do not that which he thinks and says and does.","When another blames you or hates you, or people voice similar criticisms, go to their souls, penetrate inside and see what sort of people they are. You will realize that there is no need to be racked with anxiety that they should hold any particular opinion about you.","Don\'t be ashamed to need help. Like a soldier storming a wall, you have a mission to accomplish. And if you\'ve been wounded and you need a comrade to pull you up? So what?","No one was ever injured by the truth; but he who persists in self-deception and ignorance is injured.","If you are pained by any external thing, it is not this thing that disturbs you, but your own judgment about it. It is in your power to erase this judgment about it. If anything in your own nature gives you pain, you are who hinders you from correcting your opinion.","It doesn\'t hurt me unless I interpret its happening as harmful to me. I can choose not to.","When you need encouragement, think of the qualities the people around you have: this one\'s energy, that one\'s modesty, another\'s generosity, and so on. Nothing is as encouraging as when virtues are visibly embodied in the people around us, when we\'re practically showered with them. It\'s good to keep this in mind.","Our life is what our thoughts make it.","Both happiness and unhappiness depend on perception","Imagine you were now dead, or had not lived before his moment. Now view the rest of your life as a bonus.","Your days are numbered. Use them to throw open the windows of your soul to the sun. If you do not, the sun will soon set, and you with it.","If any man despises me, that is his problem. My only concern is not doing or saying anything deserving of contempt.","Your task is to stand straight; not to be held straight.","Tranquility is nothing else than the good ordering of the mind.","When you are annoyed at someone\'s mistake, immediately look at yourself and reflect how you also fail; for example, in thinking that good equals money, or pleasure, or a bit of fame. By being mindful of this you\'ll quickly forget your anger, especially if you realize that the person was under stress, and could do little else. And, if you can, find a way to alleviate that stress.","To understand the true quality of people, you must look into their minds, and examine their pursuits and aversions.","The art of living is more like wrestling than dancing.","I cannot comprehend how any man can want anything but the truth.","Your life is an expression of all your thoughts.","Always bear this in mind, that very little indeed is necessary for living a happy life.","A man\'s true delight is to do the things he was made for.","Confine yourself to the present.","A person\'s worth is measured by the worth of what he values.","So much worse are the consequences of anger than its causes.","All things are linked with one another, and this oneness is sacred; there is nothing that is not interconnected with everything else.  For things are interdependent, and they combine to form this universal order.  There is only one universe made up of all things, and one creator who pervades them; there is one substance and one law, namely, common reason in all thinking creatures, and all truth is one-if, as we believe, there is only one path of perfection for all beings who share the same mind.","Everything is interwoven, and the web is holy.","You should banish any thoughts of how you may appear to others.","Why should anyone be afraid of change? What can take place without it? What can be more pleasing or more suitable to universal nature?  Can you take your bath without the firewood undergoing a change? Can you eat without the food undergoing a change? And can anything useful be done without change?  Don\'t you see that for you to change is just the same, and is equally necessary for universal nature?","It\'s silly to try to escape other people\'s faults. They are inescapable. Just try to escape your own.","One of the recurring themes in Marcus\' handbook is leadership\'s responsibility to work intelligently with what it is given and not waste time fantasizing about a world of flawless people and perfect choices.","The most complete revenge is not to imitate the aggressor.","Practice really hearing what people say. Do your best to get inside their mind.","Natural ability without education has more often raised a man to glory and virtue than education without natural ability.","Time is a sort of river of passing events, and strong is its current; no sooner is a thing brought to sight than it is swept by and another takes its place, and this too will be swept away.","Each day provides its own gifts.","Everything that happens happens as it should, and if you observe carefully, you will find this to be so.","Accept the things to which fate binds you, and love the people with whom fate brings you together, but do so with all your heart.","Never esteem anything as of advantage to you that will make you break your word or lose your self-respect.","Failing to understand the workings of one\'s own mind is bound to lead to unhappiness.","The intelligence of the universe is social.","If someone is able to show me that what I think or do is not right, I will happily change, for I seek the truth, by which no one ever was truly harmed. Harmed is the person who continues in his self-deception and ignorance.","Be like the cliff against which the waves continually break; but it stands firm and tames the fury of the water around it.","Whatever may happen to you was prepared for you from all eternity; and the implication of causes was from eternity spinning the thread of your being.","A person\'s life is dyed with the color of his imagination.","Alexander the Great and his mule driver both died and the same thing happened to both.","If you are pained by any external thing, it is not this that disturbs you, but your own judgment about it.","In the end, what would you gain from everlasting remembrance? Absolutely nothing. So what is left worth living for? This alone: justice in thought, goodness in action, speech that cannot deceive, and a disposition glad of whatever comes, welcoming it as necessary, as familiar, as flowing from the same source and fountain as yourself.","If you separate from . . . everything you have done in the past, everything that disturbs you about the future . . . and apply yourself to living the life that you are living-that is to say, the present-you can live all the time that remains to you until your death in calm, benevolence, and serenity.","Frequently consider the connection of all things in the universe. .. We should not say \'I am an Athenian\' or \'I am a Roman\' but \'I am a citizen of the Universe.","God sees the inner spirit stripped of flesh, skin, and all debris. For his own mind only touches the spirit that he has allowed to flow from himself into our bodies.  And if you can act the same way, you will rid yourself of all suffering. For surely if you are not preoccupied with the body that encloses you, you will not trouble yourself about clothes, houses, fame, and other showy trappings.","Remember that man lives only in the present, in this fleeting instant; all the rest of his life is either past and gone, or not yet revealed.","It\'s time you realized that you have something in you more powerful and miraculous than the things that affect you and make you dance like a puppet.","The cucumber is bitter? Then throw it out. There are brambles in the path? Then go around. That\'s all you need to know.","Withdraw to the untroubled quietude deep within the soul, and refresh yourself.","Our life is what our thoughts make it. Do every act of your life as if it were your last. In a word, your life is short. You must make the most of the present with the aid of reason and justice. Since it is possible that you may be quitting life this very moment, govern every act and thought accordingly.","Treat with utmost respect your power of forming opinions, for this power alone guards you against making assumptions that are contrary to nature and judgments that overthrow the rule of reason.","The time is at hand when you will have forgotten everything; and the time is at hand when all will have forgotten you. Always reflect that soon you will be no one, and nowhere.","Everything that happens, happens as it should.","Or is it your reputation that\'s bothering you? But look at how soon we\'re all forgotten. The abyss of endless time that swallows it all. The emptiness of those applauding hands. The people who praise us; how capricious they are, how arbitrary. And the tiny region it takes place. The whole earth a point in space - and most of it uninhabited.","Does what\'s happened keep you from acting with justice, generosity, self-control, sanity, prudence, honesty, humility, straightforward ness, and all other qualities that allow a person\'s nature to fulfill itself? So remember this principle when something threatens to cause you pain: the thing itself was no misfortune at all; to endure it and prevail is great good fortune.","The world is nothing but change, our life is only perception.","It is possible to depart from life at this moment. Have this thought in mind whenever you act, speak, or think.","Poverty is the mother of crime.","The happiness of your life depends upon the quality of your thoughts: therefore, guard accordingly, and take care that you entertain no notions unsuitable to virtue and reasonable nature.","Remember: Matter: how tiny your share of it. Time: how brief and fleeting your allotment of it. Fate: how small a role you play in it.","Remember that there is a God who desires neither praise nor glory from men created in his image, but rather that they, guided by the understanding given them, should in their actions become like unto him.","Reject your sense of injury, and the injury itself disappears.","External things are not the problem. It\'s your assessment of them. Which you can erase right now.","Discard everything except these few truths: we can live only in the present moment, in this brief now; all the rest of our life is dead and buried or shrouded in uncertainty. Short is the life we lead, and small our patch of earth.","What we do now echoes in eternity.","Choose not to be harmed and you won\'t feel harmed. Don\'t feel harmed and you haven\'t been.","Do not waste what remains of your life in speculating about your neighbors, unless with a view to some mutual benefit. To wonder what so-and-so is doing and why, or what he is saying, or thinking, or scheming -- in a word, anything that distracts you from fidelity to the ruler within you -- means a loss of opportunity for some other task.","The world is a living being - one nature, one soul. Keep that in mind.","The wise man sees in the misfortune of others what he should avoid.","Every man\'s life lies within the present; for the past is spent and done with, and the future is uncertain.","Men seek retreats for themselves, houses in the country, sea-shores, and mountains; and thou too art wont to desire such things very much. But this is altogether a mark of the most common sort of men, for it is in thy power whenever thou shalt choose to retire into thyself. For nowhere either with more quiet or more freedom from trouble does a man retire than into his own soul.","Everything is only for a day, both that which remembers and that which is remembered. Observe constantly that all things take place by change, and accustom thyself to consider that the nature of the Universe loves nothing so much as to change the things which are and to make new things like them. For everything that exists is in a manner the seed of that which will be.","How can a man find a sensible way to live? One way and one only- Philosophy. And my philosophy means keeping that vital spark within you free from damage and degradation, using it to transcend pain and pleasure, doing everything with a purpose, avoiding lies and hypocrisy, not relying on another person\'s actions or failings. To accept everything that comes, and everything that is given, as coming from that same spiritual source.","Put an end once and for all to this discussion of what a good person should be, and be one.","Are you distracted by outward cares?  Then allow yourself a space of quiet wherein you can add to your knowledge of the Good and learn to curb your restlessness.  Nowhere can a man find a quieter or more untroubled retreat than in his own soul.  Avail yourself often, then, of this retirement, and so continually renew yourself.","Whosoever does wrong, wrongs himself; whosoever does injustice, does it to himself, making himself evil.","He who pays no attention to what his neighbor does, says or thinks, preferring to concentrate on making his own actions appropriate and justifiable, better uses his time.","Nature has given to each conscious being every power she possesses, and one of these abilities is this: just as Nature converts and alters every obstacle and opposition, and fits them into their predestined place, making them a part of herself, so too the rational person is able to finesse every obstacle into an opportunity, and to use it for whatever purpose it may suit.","Nothing befalls any man which he is not fitted to endure.","How much time he saves who does not look to see what his neighbor says or does or thinks.","We are born for synergy, just like the feet, just like the hands, just like the eyes, just like the rows of upper and lower teeth. Working against each other is unnatural, and being annoyed and turning one\'s back is counterproductive.","If you do the task before you always adhering to strict reason with zeal and energy and yet with humanity, disregarding all lesser ends and keeping the divinity within you pure and upright, as though you were even now faced with its recall - if you hold steadily to this, staying for nothing and shrinking from nothing, only seeking in each passing action a conformity with nature and in each word and utterance a fearless truthfulness, then the good life shall be yours. And from this course no man has the power to hold you back.","If it\'s in your control, why do you do it? If it\'s in someone else\'s control, then who are you blaming? Atoms? The gods? Stupid either way. Blame no one. Set people straight, if you can. If not, just repair the damage.","When you are offended at anyone\'s fault, turn to yourself and study your own failings. By attending to them, you will forget your anger and learn to live wisely.","Humans have come into being for the sake of each other, so either teach them, or learn to bear them.","Nowhere can man find a quieter or more untroubled retreat than in his own soul.","Remember that all is opinion.","Look back over the past, with its changing empires that rose and fell, and you can foresee the future, too.","Loss is nothing else but change, and change is Nature\'s delight.","Do not act as if you were going to live ten thousand years. Death hangs over you. While you live, while it is in your power, be good.","Nature insists on whatever benefits the whole.","Nature set a limit on sleep - as it did on eating and drinking. And youre over the limit. But not of working. There youre still below your quota. You dont love yourself enough. Or youd love your nature too and what it demands of you. People who love what they do wear themselves down doing it. They even forget to wash and eat.","A person\'s life is what their thoughts make it.","Without a purpose, nothing should be done.","A man\'s worth is no greater than his ambitions.","He who eats my bread, does my will.","Look well into thyself; there is a source of strength which will always spring up if thou wilt always look.","Welcome every experience the looms of fate may weave for you.","How much more grievous are the consequences of anger than the causes of it.","\u200e\\"Begin the morning by saying to thyself, I shall meet with the busy-body, the ungrateful, arrogant, deceitful, envious, unsocial","Live each day as if it be your last.","Dig within. There lies the wellspring of good.","Nothing is evil which is according to nature.","Take away the complaint, \'I have been harmed,\' and the harm is taken away.","Keep reminding yourself of the way things are connected, of great relatedness. All things are implicated in one another and in sympathy with each other. This event is the consequence of some other one. Things push and pull on each other, and breathe together, and are ONE.","Body. Soul. Mind. Sensations: the body. Desires: the soul. Reasoning: the mind.","He who lives in harmony with himself lives in harmony with the universe.","Do every act of your life as if it were your last.","Your time has a limit set to it. Use it, then, to advance your enlightenment; or it will be gone, and never in your power again.","If you are pained by external things, it is not they that disturb you, but your own judgement of them. And it is in your power to wipe out that judgement now.","Live not one\'s life as though one had a thousand years, but live each day as the last.","If you are distressed by something, it is due to your own estimate of it; and you have the power to change it at will.","The main thing we were made for is to work with others.","Never act without purpose and resolve, or without the means to finish the job.","Because your own strength is unequal to the task, do not assume that it is beyond the powers of man; but if anything is within the powers and province of man, believe that it is within your own compass also.","Everything - a horse, a vine - is created for some duty... For what task, then, were you yourself created?","No man is happy who does not think himself so.","Soon you will have forgotten the world, and soon the world will have forgotten you.","To the wise, life is a problem; to the fool, a solution.","Stop whatever you\'re doing for a moment and ask yourself: Am I afraid of death because I won\'t be able to do this anymore?","The man who has a house everywhere has a home nowhere","When pain is unbearable it destroys us; when it does not it is bearable.","...the infallible man does not exist.","The true worth of a man is to be measured by the objects he pursues.","The only thing that isn\'t worthless: to live this life out truthfully and rightly, And be patience with those who don\'t.","Cultivate these, then, for they are wholly within your power: sincerity and dignity; industriousness; and sobriety. Avoid grumbling, be frugal, considerate, and frank; be temperate in manner and speech; carry yourself with authority.","Take me and cast me where you will; I shall still be possessor of the divinity within me, serene and content.","Just as nature takes every obstacle, every impediment, and works around it--turns it to its purposes, incorporates it into itself, so, too, a rational being can turn each setback into raw material and use it to achieve its goal.","Bear in mind that the measure of a man is the worth of the things he cares about. If it is good to say or do something, then it is even better to be criticized for having said or done it.","To expect an impossibility is madness.","That which is not good for the bee-hive cannot be good for the bees.","Do what you will. Even if you tear yourself apart, most people will continue doing the same things.","Everything is but what we think it.","Think of what you have rather than of what you lack. Of the things you have, select the best and then reflect how eagerly you would have sought them if you did not have them.","How ridiculous and how strange to be surprised at anything which happens in life","The soul becomes dyed with the color of its thoughts.","Nothing is worth doing pointlessly.","Don\'t let your imagination be crushed by life as a whole.","Let men see, let them know, a real man, who lives as he was meant to live.","The only wealth which you will keep forever is the wealth you have given away.","The greatest part of what we say and do is really unnecessary. If a man takes this to heart, he will have more leisure and less uneasiness.","Put from you the belief that \'I have been wronged\', and with it will go the feeling. Reject your sense of injury, and the injury itself disappears.","He is a true fugitive who flies from reason.","The universe is a single life comprising one substance and one soul.","All things are the same, familiar in enterprise, momentary in endurance, coarse in substance. All things now are as they were in the day of those whom we have buried.","Is your cucumber bitter? Throw it away. Are there briars in your path? Turn aside. That is enough. Do not go on and say, \\"Why were things of this sort ever brought into this world?\\" neither intolerable nor everlasting - if thou bearest in mind that it has its limits, and if thou addest nothing to it in imagination. Pain is either an evil to the body (then let the body say what it thinks of it!)-or to the soul. But it is in the power of the soul to maintain its own serenity and tranquility. . . .","A wrongdoer is often a man who has left something undone, not always one who has done something.","It\'s normal to feel pain in your hands and feet, if you\'re using your feet as feet and your hands as hands. And for a human being to feel stress is normal - if he\'s living a normal life. And if it\'s normal, how can it be bad?","Life is a stranger\'s sojourn, a night at an inn.","Anger cannot be dishonest.","You must become an old man in good time if you wish to be an old man long.","Be cheerful, also, and seek not external help, nor the peace which others give. A man must stand straight, and not be kept straight by others.","Waste no more time talking about great souls and how they should be, become one yourself!","The noblest kind of retribution is not to become like your enemy.","We ought to do good to others as simply as a horse runs, or a bee makes honey, or a vine bears grapes season after season without thinking of the grapes it has borne.","My true Self is free.  I cannot be contained.","I seek the truth...it is only persistence in self-delusion and ignorance that does harm.","A man makes no noise over a good deed, but passes on to another as a vine to bear grapes again in season.","In an expression of true gratitude, sadness is conspicuous only by its absence","Nothing has such power to broaden the mind as the ability to investigate systematically and truly all that comes under thy observation in life.","What doesn\'t transmit light creates its own darkness.","Life is short. That\'s all there is to say. Get what you can from the present - thoughtfully, justly.","Begin each day by telling yourself: Today I shall be meeting with interference, ingratitude, insolence, disloyalty, ill-will, and selfishness \u2013 all of them due to the offenders\u2019 ignorance of what is good or evil.","Perfection of character is this: to live each day as if it were your last, without frenzy, without apathy, without pretence.","A great estate is a great disadvantage to those who do not know how to use it, for nothing is more common than to see wealthy persons live scandalously and miserably; riches do them no service in order to virtue and happiness; therefore \'tis precept and principle, not an estate, that makes a man good for something.","Life is a warfare and a stranger\'s sojourn, and after fame is oblivion.","Keep yourself simple, good, pure, serious, and unassuming; the friend of justice and godliness; kindly, affectionate, and resolute in your devotion to duty.","Because other people are fools, must you be so too?","Submit to the fate of your own free will.","Live not as though there were a thousand years ahead of you. Fate is at your elbow; make yourself good while life and power are still yours.","Do not be ashamed of help.","Constantly contemplate the whole of time and the whole of substance, and consider that all individual things as to substance are a grain of a fig, and as to time the turning of a gimlet .","Accustom yourself not to be disregarding of what someone else has to say: as far as possible enter into the mind of the speaker.","Your mind will take on the character of your most frequent thoughts: souls are dyed by thoughts.","Snow endures but for a season, and joy comes with the morning.","It is in your power to withdraw yourself whenever you desire. Perfect tranquility within consists in the good ordering of the mind, the realm of your own.","The offender needs pity, not wrath; those who must needs be corrected, should be treated with tact and gentleness; and one must be always ready to learn better. \'The best kind of revenge is, not to become like unto them.\'","The blazing fire makes flames and brightness out of everything thrown into it.","Receive without conceit, release without struggle.","This is the chief thing: be not perturbed, for all things are according to the nature of the universal.","How very near us stand the two vast gulfs of time, the past and the future, in which all things disappear.","If thou workest at that which is before thee ... expecting nothing, fearing nothing, but satisfied with thy present activity according to Nature, and with heroic truth in every word and sound which thou utterest, thou wilt live happy. And there is no man who is able to prevent this.","This is moral perfection: to live each day as though it were the last; to be tranquil, sincere, yet not indifferent to one\'s fate.","Give thyself time to learn something new and good, and cease to be whirled around.","All is ephemeral - fame and the famous as well.","Be not careless in deeds, nor confused in words, nor rambling in thought.","Man must be arched and buttressed from within, else the temple wavers to the dust.","Don\'t go on discussing what a good person should be. Just be one.","Run down the list of those who felt intense anger at something: the most famous, the most unfortunate, the most hated, the most whatever: Where is all that now? Smoke, dust, legend...or not even a legend. Think of all the examples. And how trivial the things we want so passionately are.","A man\'s life is what his thoughts make of it.","If anyone can refute me-show me I\'m making a mistake or looking at things from the wrong perspective-I\'l l gladly change. It\'s the truth I\'m after, and the truth never harmed anyone. What harms us is to persist in self-deceit and ignorance.","When force of circumstance upsets your equanimity lose no time in recovering your self-control, and do not remain out of tune longer than you can help. Habitual recurrence to the harmony will increase your mastery of it.","Think of yourself as dead. You have lived your life. Now, take what\'s left and live it properly. What doesn\'t transmit light creates its own darkness.","Your mind will be like its habitual thoughts; for the soul becomes dyed with the color of its thoughts. Soak it then in such trains of thoughts as, for example: Where life is possible at all, a right life is possible.","Tomorrow is nothing, today is too late; the good lived yesterday.","Regain your senses, call yourself back, and once again wake up. Now that you realize that only dreams were troubling you, view this \'reality\' as you view your dreams.","Find joy in simplicity, self-respect, and indifference to what lies between virtue and vice. Love the human race. Follow the divine.","There is change in all things. You yourself are subject to continual change and some decay, and this is common to the entire universe.","You are a little soul bearing about a corpse, as Epictetus used to say.","Do not suffer a sudden impression to overbear your judgment.","Socrates used to call the opinions of the many by the name of Lamiae, bugbears to frighten children.","Be like the rocky headland on which the waves constantly break. It stands firm, and round it the seething waters are laid to rest.","All that is harmony for you, my Universe, is in harmony with me as well. Nothing that comes at the right time for you is too early or too late for me. Everything is fruit to me that your seasons bring, Nature. All things come of you, have their being in you, and return to you.","Change your attitude to the things that bother you and you will be aware of them.","Everything is banal in experience, fleeting in duration, sordid in content; in all respects the same today as generations now dead and buried have found it to be.","Accept whatever comes to you woven in the pattern of your destiny, for what could more aptly fit your needs?","Get rid of the judgement ... get rid of the \'I am hurt,\' you are rid of the hurt itself.","The whole contains nothing that is not for its advantage. By remembering that I am part of such a whole, I shall be content with everything that happens.","If you do everything as if it were the last thing you were doing in your life, and stop being aimless, stop letting your emotions override what your mind tells you, stop being hypocritical, self-centered, irritable.","Do not fear death, but welcome it, since it too comes from nature. For just as we are young and grow old, and flourish and reach maturity, have teeth and a beard and grey hairs, conceive, become pregnant, and bring forth new life, and all the other natural processes that follow the seasons of our existence, so also do we have death.  A thoughtful person will never take death lightly, impatiently, or scornfully, but will wait for it as one of life\'s natural processes.","In the morning when thou risest unwillingly, let this thought be present - I am rising to the work of a human being. Why then am I dissatisfied if I am going to do the things for which I exist and for which I was brought into the world?","Do not act as if you had a thousand years to live.","A man does not sin by commission only, but often by omission.","Take full account of what Excellencies you possess, and in gratitude remember how you would hanker after them, if you had them not.","Men are born for each other\'s sake, so either teach people or endure them","To no man make yourself a boon companion: Your joy will be less but less will be your grief","When men are inhuman, take care not to feel towards them as they do towards other humans.","Consider, for example, and you will find that almost all the transactions in the time of Vespasian differed little from those of the present day. You there find marrying and giving in marriage, educating children, sickness, death, war, joyous holidays, traffic, agriculture, flatterers, insolent pride, suspicions, laying of plots, longing for the death of others, newsmongers, lovers, misers, men canvassing far the consulship and for the kingdom; yet all these passed away, and are nowhere.","Look within. Within is the fountain of good, and it will ever bubble up, if thou wilt ever dig.","It is a disgrace to let ignorance and vanity do more with us than prudence and principle.","Life is neither good or evil, but only a place for good and evil.","Let not your mind run on what you lack as much as on what you have already.","As far as you can, get into the habit of asking yourself in relation to any action taken by another: \\"What is his point of reference here?\\" But begin with yourself: examine yourself first.","Put it out of the power of truth to give you an ill character.   If anybody reports you not to be an honest man let your   practice give him the lie.","Most of what we say and do is unnecessary: remove the superfluity, and you will have more time and less bother. So in every case one should prompt oneself: \'Is this, or is it not, something necessary?\' And the removal of the unnecessary should apply not only to actions but to thoughts also: then no redundant actions either will follow.","When you arise in the morning, think of what a precious privilege it is to be alive - to breathe, to think, to enjoy, to love ... then make that day count!","Short is the little which remains to thee of life. Live as on a mountain.","There is no man so blessed that some who stand by his deathbed won\'t hail the occasion with delight.","It is not right to vex ourselves at things, for they care not about it.","Live out your life in truth and justice, tolerant of those who are neither true nor just.","Things that have a common quality ever quickly seek their kind.","Neither in writing nor in reading wilt thou be able to lay down rules for others before thou shalt have first learned to obey rules thyself.","A noble man compares and estimates himself by an idea which is higher than himself; and a mean man, by one lower than himself. The one produces aspiration; the other ambition, which is the way in which a vulgar man aspires.","A man should always have these two rules in readiness. First, to do only what the reason of your ruling and legislating faculties suggest for the service of man. Second, to change your opinion whenever anyone at hand sets you right and unsettles you in an opinion, but this change of opinion should come only because you are persuaded that something is just or to the public advantage, not because it appears pleasant or increases your reputation.","No one wearies of benefits received.","Why do you hunger for length of days? The point of life is to follow reason and the divine spirit and to accept whatever nature sends you. To live in this way is not to fear death, but to hold it in contempt. Death is only a thing of terror for those unable to live in the present. Pass on your way, then, with a smiling face, under the smile of him who bids you go","Be content to seem what you really are.","All is as thinking makes it so","Receive the gifts of fortune without pride, and part with them without reluctance.","Observe constantly that all things take place by change, and accustom thyself to consider that the nature of the Universe loves nothing so much as to change the things which are, and to make new things like them.","Remember this - that there is a proper dignity and proportion to be observed in the performance of every act of life.","Despise not death, but welcome it, for nature wills it like all else.","Let every action aim solely at the common good.","When the sovereign spirit within us is true to nature, it stands poised and ready to adjust to every change in circumstances and to seize each new opportunity. It doesn\'t approach an object with prejudice or preconception, but handles each thing dispassionately before embracing it and, if necessary, finds advantage in what opposes it. It is like fire in this regard. Whereas a feeble flame might suffocate under a pile of dry sticks, a robust fire consumes everything it touches. The more objects of any kind heaped on it, the higher it rises, the hotter it burns.","Happiness is no other than soundness and perfection of mind.","Keep constantly in mind in how many things you yourself have witnessed changes already. The universe is change, life is understanding.","The healthy eye ought to see all visible things and not to say, I wish for green things; for this is the condition of a diseased eye.","To my great-grandfather I owed the advice to dispense with the education of the schools and have good masters at home instead - and to realize that no expense should be grudged for this purpose.","While you live, while it is in your power, be good.","The constant recollection of death is the test of human conduct.","Constantly regard the universe as one living being, having one substance and one soul; and observe how all things have reference to one perception, the perception of this one living being; and how all things act with one movement; and how all things are the cooperating causes of all things which exist; observe too the continuous spinning of the thread and the contexture of the web.","People find pressure in different ways. I find it in keeping my mind clear. In not turning away from people or the things that happen to them. In accepting and welcoming everything I see. In treating each thing as it deserves.","What springs from earth dissolves to earth again, and heaven-born things fly to their native seat.","When you find an unwillingness to rise early in the morning, make this short speech to yourself: I am getting up now to do the business of a man; and am I out of humour for going about that I was made for, and for the sake of which I was sent into the world? Was I then designed for nothing but to doze and keep warm beneath the counterpane? Well! but this is a comfortable way of living.","Do not think that what is hard for you to master is humanly impossible; but if a thing is humanly possible, consider it to be within your reach.","It is not the body, nor the personality that is the true self. The true self is eternal. Even on the point of death we can say to ourselves, \\"my true self is free. I cannot be contained.\\"","He that lives alone lives in danger; society avoids many dangers.","Death is a release from the impressions of the senses, and from desires that make us their puppets, and from the vagaries of the mind, and from the hard service of the flesh.","There is no misfortune, but to bear it nobly is good fortune.","The wrongdoer is often the person who left something undone, rather than the person who has done something","Let no act be done without purpose.","No one loses any other life than the one he now lives, nor does one live any other life than that which he will lose.","Nothing proceeds from nothingness, as also nothing passes away into non-existence.","Try to live the life of the good man who is more than content with what is allocated to him.","Do not expect Plato\'s ideal republic; be satisfied with even the smallest step forward, and consider this no small achievement.","People generally despise where they flatter, and cringe to those they would gladly overtop; so that truth and ceremony are two things.","What we cannot bear removes us from life; what remains can be borne.","The sinner sins against himself; the wrongdoer wrongs himself, becoming the worse by his own action.","Even the stoics agree that certainty is very hard to come at; that our assent is worth little, for where is infallibility to be found?","Observe constantly that all things take place by change.","A spider is proud when it has caught a fly; one man when he has caught a poor hare, and another when he has taken a little fish in a net, and another when he has taken wild boars, and another when he has taken bears, and another when he has taken Sarmatians. Are not these robbers, if you examine their opinions?","Live with the gods. And he does so who constantly shows them that his soul is satisfied with what is assigned to him.","It is a sin to persue pleasure as a good and to avoid pain as a evil.","I was once a fortunate man but at some point fortune abandoned me. But true good fortune is what you make for yourself. Good fortune: good character, good intentions, and good actions.","For nowhere either with more quiet or more freedom from trouble does a man retire than into his own soul, particularly when he has within him such thoughts that by looking into them he is immediately in perfect tranquility; and I affirm that tranquility is nothing else than the good ordering of the mind.","Take it that you have died today, and your life\'s story is ended; and henceforward regard what future time may be given you as uncovenanted surplus, and live it out in harmony with nature.","Remember that very little is needed to make a happy life.","We are born for cooperation, as are the feet, the hands, the eyelids, and the upper and lower jaws.","When jarred, unavoidably, by circumstance revert at once to yourself and don\'t lose the rhythm more than you can help. You\'ll have a better grasp of harmony if you keep going back to it.","Each thing is of like form from everlasting and comes round again in its cycle...","Adapt yourself to the things among which your lot has been cast and love sincerely the fellow creatures with whom destiny has ordained that you shall live.","Death, like birth, is a secret of Nature.","Every instant of time... is a pinprick of eternity.","...if a man comes to his fortieth year, and has any understanding at all, he has virtually seen - thanks to their similarity - all possible happenings, both past and to come.","The universe is transformation: life is opinion.","A man must stand erect, not be kept erect by others.","Always follow these two rules: first, act only on what your reasoning mind proposes for the good of humanity, and second, change your opinion if someone shows you it\'s wrong. This change of mind must proceed only from the conviction that it\'s both correct and for the common good, but not because it will give you pleasure and make you popular.","Dig inside. Inside is the fountain of good, and it will forever flow, if you will forever dig.","Forward, as occasion offers. Never look round to see whether any shall note it.... Be satisfied with success in even the smallest matter, and think that even such a result is no trifle.","Remember that all things are only opinion and that it is in your power to think as you please.","If any man should conceive certain things as being really good, such as prudence, temperance, justice, fortitude, he would not after having first conceived these endure to listen to anything which should not be in harmony with what is really good.","Dress not thy thoughts in too fine a raiment. And be not a man of superfluous words or superfluous deeds.","There is nothing happens to any person but what was in his power to go through with.","From Plato: the man who has an elevated mind and takes a view of all time and of all substance, dost thou suppose it possible for him to think that human life is anything great? It is not possible, he said. Such a man then will think that death also is no evil.","Everything is ephemeral, both that which remembers and that which is remembered.","Life is a campaign, a brief staying in a strange region.","But if anything in thy own dispositiongives thee pain, who hinders thee from correcting thy opinion? And even if thou art pained because thou art not doing some particular thing which seems to thee to be right, why dost thou not rather act than complain?- But some insuperable obstacle is in the way?- Do not be grieved then, for the cause of its not being done depends not on thee.- But it is not worth while to live if this cannot be done.- Take thy departure then from life contentedly, just as he dies who is in full activity, and well pleased too with the things which are obstacles.","The best revenge is to be unlike him who performed the injury.","Everything harmonizes with me, which is harmonious to thee, o Universe. Nothing for me is too early or too late, which is in due time for thee.","Consider that everything is opinion, and opinion is in thy power.","That which comes after ever conforms to that which has gone before.","\\"Sweep me up and send me where you please.\\" For there I will retain my spirit, tranquil and content, as long as it can feel and act in harmony with its own nature. Is a change of place enough reason for my soul to become unhappy and worn, for me to become depressed, humbled, cowering, and afraid? Can you discover any reasons for this?","Adorn thyself with simplicity and with indifference towards the things which lie between virtue and vice. Love mankind. Follow God. The poet says that Law rules all. And it is enough to\\nremember that law rules all.","Remember that to change your mind and follow him who sets you right is to be none the less free than you were before.","Always take the short cut; and that is the rational one. Therefore say and do everything according to soundest reason.","Leave the wrong done by another where the wrong arose.","For any particular thing, ask: What is it in itself? What is its nature?","No one can keep you from living as your nature requires. Nothings can happen to you that is not required by Nature.","...the sole thing of which any man can be deprived is the present; since this is all he owns, and nobody can lose what is not his.","In the case of all things which have a certain constitution, whatever harm may happen to any of them, that which is affected becomes consequently worse; but in like case, a man becomes both\\nbetter... and more worthy of praise, by making the right use of these accidents.","Look deep into the hearts of men, and see what delights and disgusts the wise.","Our inward power, when it obeys nature, reacts to events by accommodating itself to what it faces - to what is possible. It needs no specific material. It pursues its own aims as circumstances allow; it turns obstacles into fuel. As a fire overwhelms what would have quenched a lamp. What\'s thrown on top of the conflagration is absorbed, consumed by it - and makes it burn still higher.","Observe always that everything is the result of a change, and get used to thinking that there is nothing Nature loves so well as to change existing forms and to make new ones like them.","It is within our power not to make a judgement about something, and so not disturb our minds; for nothing in itself possesses the power to form our judgements.","Look deeply.  Don\'t miss the inherent quality and value of everything.","The gods have provided me with clear and compelling signs of what it means to live in conformity to nature. They did their part. So far as their gifts, aid, and inspiration are concerned, nothing prevented me from following the path prescribed by nature. If from time to time I have strayed from this path, the fault lies with me and with my failure to heed the gods\' signs, or rather, their explicit instructions.","Time is a kind of river, an irresistible flood sweeping up men and events and carrying them headlong, one after the other, to the great sea of being.","Observe the movements of the stars as if you were running their courses with them, and let your mind constantly dwell on the changes of the elements into each other. Such imaginings wash away the filth of life on the ground.","Suppose that men kill thee, cut thee in pieces, curse thee, what can these things do to prevent thy mind from remaining pure, wise, sober, just?","To live each day as though one\'s last, never flustered, never apathetic, never attitudinizing - here is the perfection of character.","The universe is in change, life is an opinion.","How ridiculous not to flee from one\'s own wickedness, which is possible, yet endeavor to flee from another\'s which is not.","Everything is in a state of metamorphosis. Thou thyself art in everlasting change and in corruption to correspond; so is the whole universe.","Men despise one another and flatter one another; and men wish to raise themselves above one another, and crouch before one another.","If any man can convince me and bring home to me that I do not think or act aright, gladly will I change; for I search after truth, by which man never yet was harmed. But he is harmed who abideth on still in his deception and ignorance.","The stone that is thrown into the air is none the worse for falling down, and none the better for going up.","The soul is dyed by the thoughts. Dye it then, with a continuous series of such thoughts as these - that where a man can live, there - if he will - he can also live well.","Stop talking about what the good man is like, and just be one.","How many after being celebrated by fame have been given up to oblivion; and how many who have celebrated the fame of others have long been dead.","Were you to live three thousand years, or even thirty thousand, remember that the sole life which a man can lose is that which he is living at the moment; and furthermore, that he can have no other life except the one he loses.","I have often wondered how it is that every man loves himself more than all the rest of men, but yet sets less value on his own opinions of himself than on the opinions of others.","The best sort of revenue is not to be like him who did the injury.","Give your heart to the trade you have learnt, and draw refreshment from it. Let the rest of your days be spent as one who has whole-heartedly committed his all to the gods and is thenceforth no man\'s master or slave.","Everywhere and at all times it is in thy power piously to acquiesce in thy present condition, and to behave justly to those who are about thee, and to exert thy skill upon thy present\\n thoughts, that nothing shall steal into them without being well examined.","Gluttony and drunkenness have two evils attendant on them; they make the carcass smart, as well as the pocket.","Where any work can be done conformably to the reason which is common to gods and men, there we have nothing to fear; for where we are able to get profit by means of the activity which is successful and proceeds according to our constitution, there no harm is to be suspected.","Is any man afraid of change? Why what can take place without change? What then is more pleasing or more suitable to the universal nature?","Observe and contemplate on the hidden things of life: how a man\'s seed is but the beginning, it takes others to bring it to fruition. Think how food undergoes such changes to produce health and strength. See the power of these hidden things which, like the wind cannot been seen, but its effects can be.","Within ten days thou wilt seem a god to those to whom thou art now a beast and an ape, if thou wilt return to thy principles and the worship of reason.","Look beneath the surface; let not the several quality of a thing nor its worth escape thee.","Nothing befalls a man except what is in his nature to endure.","The one thing worth living for is to keep one\'s soul pure.","Consider when thou art much vexed or grieved, that man\'s life is only a moment, and after a short time we are all laid out dead.","In the life of a man, his time is but a moment, his being an incessant flux, his sense a dim rushlight, his body a prey of worms, his soul an unquiet eddy, his fortune dark, his fame doubtful. In short, all that is body is as coursing waters, all that is of the soul as dreams and vapors.","Everything that happens either happens in such a way as you are formed by nature to bear it, or as you are not formed by nature to bear it.","Begin - to begin is half the work, let half still remain; again begin this, and thou wilt have finished.","Death - a stopping of impressions through the senses, and of the pulling of the cords of motion, and of the ways of thought, and of service to the flesh.","Which is recorded of Socrates, that he was able both to abstain from, and to enjoy, those things which many are too weak to abstain from, and cannot enjoy without excess. But to be strong enough both to bear the one and to be sober in the other is the mark of a man who has a perfect and invincible soul.","Objective judgement, now, at this very moment. Unselfish action, now, at this very moment. Willing acceptance - now, at this very moment - of all external events. That\'s all you need.","If souls survive death for all eternity, how can the heavens hold them all? Or for that matter, how can the earth hold all the bodies that have been buried in it? The answers are the same. Just as on earth, with the passage of time, decaying and transmogrified corpses make way for the newly dead, so souls released into the heavens, after a season of flight, begin to break up, burn, and be absorbed back into the womb of reason, leaving room for souls just beginning to fly. This is the answer for those who believe that souls survive death.","There is a limit circumscribed to your time \u2013 if you do not use it to clear away your clouds, it will be gone, and you will be gone, and the opportunity will not return","People who labor all their lives but have no purpose to direct every thought and impulse toward are wasting their time-even when hard at work.","Limit time to the present. Meditate upon your last hour.","Consider in what condition both in body and soul a man should be when he is overtaken by death; and consider the shortness of life, the boundless abyss of time past and future, the feebleness of all matter.","Men exist for the sake of one another.","This is the mark of a perfect character - to pass through each day as though it were the last, without agitation, without torpor, and without pretense.","He that dies in extreme old age will be reduced to the same state with him that is cut down untimely.","Death hangs over thee, While thou still live, while thou may, do good.","Take away your opinion, and then there is taken away the complaint, \'I have been harmed.\' Take away the complaint, \'I have been harmed,\' and the harm is taken away.","One whose chief regard is for his own mind, and for the divinity within him and the service of its goodness, will strike no poses, utter no complaints, and crave neither for solitude nor yet for a crowd. Best of all, his life will be free from continual pursuing and avoiding.","A good man does not spy around for the black spots in others, but presses unswervingly on towards his mark.","That which is really beautiful has no need of anything; not more than law, not more than truth, not more than benevolence or modesty.","Do you see what little is required of a man to live a well-tempered and god-fearing life? Obey these precepts, and the gods will ask nothing more.","Failure to read what is happening in another\'s soul is not easily seen as a cause of unhappiness: but those who fail to attend the motions of their own soul are necessarily unhappy.","What matter and opportunity [for thy activity] art thou avoiding? For what else are all these things, except exercises for the reason, when it has viewed carefully and by examination into their nature the things which happen in life? Persevere then until thou shalt have made these things thy own, as the stomach which is strengthened makes all things its own, as the blazing fire makes flame and brightness out of everything that is thrown into it.","We are the other of the other","Whatever any one does or says, I must be good; just as if the emerald were always saying this: \\"Whatever any one does or says, I must still be emerald, and keep my color.","Love only what befalls you and is spun for you by fate.","Nothing happens to any man that he is not formed by nature to bear.","All things fade and quickly turn to myth.","Only to the rational animal is it given to follow voluntarily what happens; but simply to follow is a necessity imposed on all.","The things... which are proper to the understanding no other man is used to impede, for neither fire, nor iron, nor tyrant, nor abuse, touches it in any way. When it has been made a sphere, it continues a sphere.","He who fears death either fears the loss of sensation or a different kind of sensation. But if thou shalt have no sensation, neither wilt thou feel any harm; and if thou shalt acquire another kind of sensation, thou wilt be a different kind of living being and thou wilt not cease to live.","In man\'s life, time is but a moment; being, a flux; sense is dim; the material frame corruptible; soul, an eddy of breath; fortune a thing inscrutable, and fame precarious.","All that happens is as usual and familiar as the rose in spring and the crop in summer.","Never value anything as profitable to thyself which shall compel thee to break thy promise, to lose thy self-respect, to hate any man, to suspect, to curse, to act the hypocrite, to desire anything which needs walls and curtains.","After all, what does fame everlasting mean? Mere vanity.","Aptitude found in the understanding and is often inherited. Genius coming from reason and imagination, rarely.","Anything in any way beautiful derives its beauty from itself and asks nothing beyond itself. Praise is no part of it, for nothing is made worse or better by praise.","Can we wonder that men perish and are forgotten, when their noblest and most enduring works decay? Death comes even to monumental structures, and oblivion rests on the most illustrious names.","Infinity is a fathomless gulf, into which all things vanish.","The memory of everything is very soon overwhelmed in time.","Severally on the occasion of everything that thou doest, pause and ask thyself, if death is a dreadful thing because it deprives thee of this.","Such as are thy habitual thoughts, such also will be the character of thy mind; for the soul is dyed by the thoughts.","Know the joy of life by piling good deed on good deed until no rift or cranny appears between them.","Misfortune nobly born is good fortune.","The gods sustain and guide all their works.","Every moment think steadily as a Roman and a man to do what thou hast in hand with perfect and simple dignity, and feeling of affection, and freedom, and justice; and to give thyself relief from all other thoughts. And thou wilt give thyself relief, if thou doest every act of thy life as if it were the last, laying aside all carelessness and passionate aversion from the commands of reason, and all hypocrisy, and self-love, and discontent with the portion which has been given to thee.","But if we judge only those things which are in our power to be good or bad, there remains no reason either for finding fault with God or standing in a hostile attitude to man.","If mind is common to us, then also the reason, whereby we are reasoning beings, is common. If this be so, then also the reason which enjoins what is to be done or left undone is common. If this be so, law also is common; if this be so, we are citizens; if this be so, we are partakers in one constitution; if this be so, the Universe is a kind of Commonwealth.","It is right that man should love those who have offended him. He will do so when he remembers that all men are his relations, and that it is through ignorance and involuntarily that they sin,--and then we all die so soon.","Since you are an integral part of a social system, let every act of yours contribute to the harmonization of social life. Any action that is not related directly or remotely to this social aim disturbs your life, and destroys your unity.","All things of the body stream away like a river, all things of the mind are dreams and delusion; life is warfare, and a visit to a strange land; the only lasting fame is oblivion.","When you have done a good deed that another has had the benefit of, why do you need a third reward-as fools do-praise for having done well or looking for a favor in return.","From the philosopher Catulus, never to be dismissive of a friend\'s accusation, even if it seems unreasonable, but to make every effort to restore the relationship to its normal condition.","Things can never touch the soul, but stand inert outside it, so that disquiet can arise only from fancies within.","Whatever may happen to thee, it was prepared for thee from all eternity.","... Allow yourself a space of quiet, wherein you can add to your knowledge of the Good and learn to curb your restlessness. Guard also against another kind of error: the folly of those who weary their days in much business, but lack any aim on which their whole effort, nay, their whole thought, is focused.","One universe made up all that is; and one God in it all, and one principle of being, and one law, the reason shared by all thinking creatures, and one truth.","And thou wilt give thyself relief, if thou doest every act of thy life as if it were the last.","This thou must always bear in mind, what is the nature of the whole.","Remind oneself continually of one of those who practiced virtue in days gone by.","So you know how things stand. Now forget what they think of you. Be satisfied if you can live the rest of your life, however short, as your nature demands. Focus on that, and don\'t let anything distract you. You\'ve wandered all over and finally realized that you never found what you were after: how to live. Not in syllogisms, not in money, or fame, or self-indulgence. Nowhere.","Take the shortest route. The one that nature planned - to speak and act in the healthiest way. Do that, and be free of pain and stress, free of all calculations and pretension.","As thou thyself art a component part of a social system, so let every act of thine be a component part of social life. Whatever act of thine that has no reference, either immediately or remotely, to a social end, this tears asunder thy life, and does not allow it to be one, and it is of the nature of a mutiny, just as when in a popular assembly a man acting by himself stands apart from the general agreement.","No state sorrier than that of the man who keeps up a continual round, and pries into \\"the secrets of the nether world,\\" as saith the poet, and is curious in conjecture of what is in his\\nneighbour\'s heart.","I, who have never willfully pained another, have no business to pain myself.","Frightened of change? But what can exist without it? What\'s closer to nature\'s heart? Can you take a hot bath and leave the firewood as it was? Eat food without transforming it? Can any vital process take place without something being changed? Can\'t you see? It\'s just the same with you - and just as vital to nature.","Even while a thing is in the act of coming into existence, some part of it has already ceased to be.","Does the light of the lamp shine without losing its splendour until it is extinguished; and shall the truth which is in thee and justice and temperance be extinguished before thy death?","Be not disgusted, nor discouraged, nor dissatisfied, if thou dost not succeed in doing everything according to right principles; but when thou bast failed, return back again, and be content if the greater part of what thou doest is consistent with man\'s nature, and love this to which thou returnest","Nature which governs the whole will soon change all things which you see, and out of their substance will make other things and again other things... in order that the world may be ever new.","Be mindful at all times of the following: the nature of the whole universe, the nature of the part that is me, the relation of the one to the other, the one so vast, the other so small.","He does not write at all whose poems no man reads","It will suffice thee to remember as concerning pain ... that the mind may, by stopping all manner of commerce and sympathy with the body, still retain its own tranquility.","Always run to the short way; and the short way is the natural: accordingly say and do everything in conformity with the soundest reason. For such a purpose frees a man from trouble, and warfare, and all artifice and ostentatious display.","And finally remember that nothing harms him who is really a citizen, which does not harm the state; nor yet does anything harm the state which does not harm law [order]; and of these things which are called misfortunes not one harms law. What then does not harm law does not harm either state or citizen.","Remember how often you have postponed minding your interest, and let slip those opportunities the gods have given you. It is now high time to consider what sort of world you are part of, and from what kind of governor of it you are descended; that you have a set period assigned you to act in, and unless you improve it to brighten and compose your thoughts, it will quickly run off with you, and be lost beyond recovery.","To her who gives and takes back all, to nature, the man who is instructed and modest says, Give what thou wilt; take back what thou wilt. And he says this not proudly, but obediently and well pleased with her.","That which makes the man no worse than he was makes his life no worse: it has no power to harm, without or within.","Since it is possible that thou mayest depart from life this very moment, regulate every act and thought accordingly. But to go away from among men, if there are gods, is not a thing to be afraid of, for the gods will not involve thee in evil; but if indeed they do not exist, or if they have no concern about human affairs, what is it to me to live in a universe devoid of gods or devoid of Providence? But Gods there are, undoubtedly, and they regard human affairs; and have put it wholly in our power, that we should not fall into what is truly evil.","Neither worse then nor better is a thing made by being praised.","Though you break your heart, men will go on as before.","A little flesh, a little breath, and a Reason to rule all - that is myself.","Love the little trade which thou hast learned, and be content therewith.","Let goodness go with the doing.","In reading and writing, you cannot lay down rules until you have learnt to obey them. Much more so in life.","Stick to what\'s in front of you - idea, action, utterance.","If man reflects on the changes and transformations which follow one another like wave after wave and their rapidity, he will despise everything which is perishable.","You don\'t have to turn this into something. It doesn\'t have to upset you. Things can\'t shape our decisions by themselves.","No matter what anyone says or does, my task is to be emerald, my color undiminished.","All that is from the gods is full of Providence.","How many together with whom I came into the world are already gone out of it.","The whole universe is change and life itself is but what you deem it","Leave other people\'s mistakes where they lie.","In the same degree in which a man\'s mind is nearer to freedom from all passion, in the same degree also is it nearer to strength.","Frequently consider the connection of all things in the universe.","The mind which is free from passions is a citadel, for man has nothing more secure to which he can fly for refuge and for the future be inexpugnable . He then who has not seen this is an ignorant man: but he who has seen it and does not fly to this refuge is unhappy.","Consider frequently the connection of all things in the universe and their relation to one another. For things are somehow implicated with one another, and all in a way friendly to one another.","Give full attention and devotion to each act.","If the gods care not for me and for my children, There is a reason for it.","To refrain from imitation is the best revenge.","Because a thing seems difficult for you, do not think it impossible for anyone to accomplish.","In the morning, when you are sluggish about getting up, let this thought be present: \'I am rising to a man\'s work.\'","Whatever anyone does or says, I must be emerald and keep my colour.","Does a man shrink from change? Why, what can come into being save by change?","It is the act of a madman to pursue impossibilities .","How powerful is man! He is able to do all that God wishes him to do. He is able to accept all that God sends upon him.","Do not disturb yourself by picturing your life as a whole; do not assemble in your mind the many and varied troubles which have come to you in the past and will come again in the future, but ask yourself with regard to every present difficulty: \'What is there in this that is unbearable and beyond endurance?\'","You need to be prepared for firm decisions and action, without losing gentleness towards those who obstruct or abuse you. It\'s as great a weakness to be angry with them as it is to abandon your plan of action and give up through fear.","No form of nature is inferior to art; for the arts merely imitate natural forms.","For a man can lose neither the past nor the future; for how can one take from him that which is not his? So remember these two points: first, that each thing is of like form from everlasting and comes round again in its cycle, and that it signifies not whether a man shall look upon the same things for a hundred years or two hundred, or for an infinity of time; second, that the longest lived and the shortest lived man, when they come to die, lose one and the same thing.","Everything is mere opinion.","When you have trouble getting out of bed in the morning, remember that your defining characteristic-what defines a human being-is to work with others.","The stream of tendency in which all things seek to fulfill the law of their being.","It is not fit that I should give myself pain, for I have never intentionally given pain even to another.","The universal order and the personal order are nothing but different expressions and manifestations of a common underlying principle.","Persuade me or prove to me that I am mistaken in thought or deed, and I will gladly change - for it is the truth I seek, and the truth never harmed anyone. Harm comes from persisting in error and clinging to ignorance.","Search men\'s governing principles, and consider the wise, what they shun and what they cleave to.","From Alexander the Platonic, not frequently nor without necessity to say to any one, or to write in a letter, that I have no leisure; nor continually to excuse the neglect of duties required by our relation to those with whom we live, by alleging urgent occupations.","Yet living and dying, honour and dishonour, pain and pleasure, riches and poverty, and so forth are equally the lot of good men and bad. Things like these neither elevate nor degrade; and therefore they are no more good than they are evil.","The whole contains nothing which is not or its advantage; and all natures indeed have this common principle, but the nature of the universe has this principle besides, that it cannot be compelled even by any external cause to generate anything harmful to itself.","To live happily is an inward power of the soul.","Reverence the gods, and help men. Short is life.","Where a man can live, he can also live well.","Think on this doctrine, - that reasoning beings were created for one another\'s sake; that to be patient is a branch of justice, and that men sin without intending it.","The best way of avenging thyself is not to become like the wrong-doer.","Look within, for within is the wellspring of virtue, which will not cease flowing, if you cease not from digging.","No longer talk at all about the kind of man that a good man ought to be, but be such","Let it be your constant method to look into the design of people\'s actions, and see what they would be at, as often as it is practicable; and to make this custom the more significant, practice it first upon yourself.","The nature of the All moved to make the universe.","The lot assigned to every man is suited to him, and suits him to itself.","But this is altogether a mark of the most common sort of men, for it is in your power whenever you choose to retire into yourself.","A man should be upright, not kept upright.","He who has seen present things has seen all, both everything which has taken place from all eternity and everything which will be for time without end; for all things are of one kin and of one form.","From my grandfather\'s father, I learned to dispense with attendance at public schools, and to enjoy good teachers at home, and to recognize that on such things money should be eagerly spent.","Let your one delight and refreshment be to pass from one service to the community to another, with God ever in mind.","The act of dying is one of the acts of life.","All things are in the act of change; thou thyself in ceaseless transformation and partial decay, and the whole universe with thee.","Be content with what you are, and wish not change; nor dread your last day, nor long for it.","Enough of this wretched life and murmuring and apish tricks. Why art thou disturbed? What is there new in this? What unsettles thee? Is it the form of the thing? Look at it. Or is it the matter? Look at it. But besides these there is nothing. Towards the gods, then, now become at last more simple and better. It is the same whether we examine these things for a hundred years or three.","The honest and good man ought to be exactly like a man who smells strong, so that the bystander as soon as he comes near him must smell whether he choose or not.","Think not disdainfully of death, but look on it with favor; for even death is one of the things that Nature wills.","Your manners will depend very much upon the quality of what you frequently think on; for the soul is as it were tinged with the colour and complexion of thought.","Nothing happens to any man which he is not formed by nature to bear. The same things happen to another, and either because he does not see that they have happened or because he would show a great spirit he is firm and remains unharmed. It is a shame then that ignorance and conceit should be stronger than wisdom.","Here is the rule to remember in the future, When anything tempts you to be bitter: not, \'This is a misfortune\' but \'To bear this worthily is good fortune.\'","When you have been compelled by circumstances to be disturbed in any manner, quickly return to yourself, and do not continue out of tune longer than the compulsion lasts. You will have increasing control over your own harmony by continually returning to it.","The happiness and unhappiness of the rational, social animal depends not on what he feels but on what he does; just as his virtue and vice consist not in feeling but in doing.","I bless the gods for not letting my education in rhetoric, poetry, and other literary studies come easily to me, and thereby sparing me from an absorbing interest in these subjects.","Glory arrives too late when it comes only to one\'s ashes","He would be the finer gentleman that should leave the world without having tasted of lying or pretence of any sort, or of wantonness or conceit.","Take care that you entertain no notions unsuitable to virtue and reasonable nature.","Purge your mind of all aimless and idle thoughts, especially those that pry into the affairs of others or wish them ill.","Do not consider anything for your interest which makes you break your word, quit your modesty or inclines you to any practice which will not bear the light or look the world in the face.","A good disposition is invincible, if it be genuine.","The passing minute is every man\'s equal possession but what has once gone by is not ours.","Receive wealth or prosperity without arrogance; and be ready to let it go.","Time is like a river made up of the events which happen, and a violent stream; for as soon as a thing has been seen, it is carried away, and another comes in its place, and this will be carried away too.","Anything that is beautiful is beautiful just as it is. Praise forms no part of its beauty, since praise makes things neither better nor worse. This applies even more to what it commonly called beautiful: natural objects, for example, or works of art. True beauty has no need of anything beyond itself.","Find time still to be learning somewhat good, and give up being desultory.","Man is born for deeds of kindness.","Art thou angry with him whose armpits stink? Art thou angry with him whose mouth smells foul?","Think of the country mouse and of the town mouse, and of the alarm and trepidation of the town mouse.","This thou must always bear in mind, what is the nature of the whole, \\n and what is my nature, and how this is related to that, and what \\n kind of a part it is of what kind of a whole; and that there is no one \\n who hinders thee from always doing and saying the things which are \\n according to the nature of which thou art a part.","The earth loveth the shower,\\" and \\"the holy \xe6ther knoweth what love is.\\" The Universe, too, loves to create whatsoever is destined to be made.","Everything that exists is in a manner the seed of that which will be.","Thou sufferest justly: for thou choosest rather to become good to-morrow than to be good to-day.","Ifit be a thing external that causes thy grief, know, that it is not that properly that doth cause it, but thine own conceit and opinion concerning the thing: which thou mayest rid\\n thyself of, when thou wilt.","Direct thy attention to what is said. Let thy understanding enter into the things that are doing and the things which do them.","He who does wrong does wrong against himself. He who acts unjustly acts unjustly to himself, because he makes himself bad.","And in the case of superior things like stars, we discover a kind of unity in separation. The higher we rise on the scale of being, the easier it is to discern a connection even among things separated by vast distances.","Nothing can come out of nothing, any more than a thing can go back to nothing.","My city and state are Rome. But as a human being? The world. So for me, \\"good\\" can only mean what\'s good for both communities.","Once you have done a man a service, what more reward would you have? Is it not enough to have obeyed the laws of your own nature, without expecting to be paid for it?","Look at everything that exists, and observe that it is already in dissolution and in change, and as it were putrefaction or dispersion, or that everything is so constituted by nature as to die.","The gods gave me a father who ruled over me and rid me of any trace of arrogance and showed me that one can live in a palace without bodyguards, extravagant attire, chandeliers, statues, and other luxuries. He taught me that it is possible to live instead pretty much in the manner of a private citizen without losing any of the dignity and authority a ruler must possess to discharge his imperial duties effectively.","Blot out vain pomp; check impulse; quench appetite; keep reason under its own control.","We are born for cooperation","It is a shameful thing for the soul to faint while the body still perseveres.","Look to the essence of a thing, whether it be a point of doctrine, of practice, or of interpretation.","Short-lived are both the praiser and the praised, and rememberer and the remembered: and all this in a nook of this part of the world; and not even here do all agree, no, not any one with himself: and the whole earth too is a point.","At day\'s first light have in readiness, against disinclination to leave your bed, the thought that \\"I am rising for the work of man.\\"","Thou seest how few be the things, the which if a man has at his command his life flows gently on and is divine.","Every living organism is fulfilled when it follows the right path for its own nature.","The substance of the universe is obedient and compliant; and the reason which governs it has in itself no cause for doing evil, for it has no malice, nor does it do evil to anything, nor is anything harmed by it. But all things are made and perfected according to this reason.","The controlling Intelligence understands its own nature, and what it does, and whereon it works.","If it\'s time for you to go, leave willingly - as you would to accomplish anything that can be done with grace and honor.","It is satisfaction to a man to do the proper works of a man.","All those things at which thou wishest to arrive by a circuitous road, thou canst have now, if thou dost not refuse them to thyself.","People exist for one another.","Everything is born from change. ...there is nothing nature loves more that to alter what exists and make new things like it. All that exists is the seed of what will emerge from it. You think the only seeds are the one that make plants and children? Go deeper.","If thou canst see sharp, look and judge wisely, says the philosopher.","Doctors keep their scalpels and other instruments handy, for emergencies. Keep your philosophy ready too - ready to understand heaven and earth. In everything you do, even the smallest thing, remember the chain that links them. Nothing earthly succeeds by ignoring heaven, nothing heavenly by ignoring earth.","There is no man so fortunate that there shall not be by him when he is dying some who are pleased with what is going to happen.","Remember that what pulls the strings is the force hidden within; there lies the power to persuade, there the life, - there, if one must speak out, the real man.","Think of the universal substance, of which thou has a very small portion; and of universal time, of which a short and indivisible interval has been assigned to thee; and of that which is fixed by destiny, and how small a part of it thou art","That which has died falls not out of the universe. If it stays here, it also changes here, and is dissolved into its proper parts, which are elements of the universe and of thyself. And these too change, and they murmur not\\".","Truth and ceremony are two things.","Vex not thy spirit at the course of things; they heed not thy vexation.  How ludicrous and outlandish is astonishment at anything that may happen in life.","Be satisfied with your business, and learn to love what you were bred to.","The ruling power within, when it is in its natural state, is so related to outer circumstances that it easily changes to accord with what can be done and what is given it to do.","A rational nature admits of nothing but what is serviceable to the rest of mankind.","How easy it is to repel and release every impression which is troublesome and immediately to be tranquil.","In one way an arrow moves, in another way the mind. The mind indeed, both when it exercises caution and when it is employed about inquiry, moves straight onward not the less, and to its object.","Because a thing is difficult for you, do not therefore suppose it to be beyond mortal power. On the contrary, if anything is possible and proper for man to do, assume that it must fall within your own capacity.","All things from eternity are of like forms and come round in circle.","Neither in thy actions be sluggish nor in thy conversation without method, nor wandering in thy thoughts, nor let there be in thy soul inward contention nor external effusion, nor in life be so busy as to have no leisure.","I consist of a little body and a soul.","Whatever the universal nature assigns to any man at any time is for the good of that man at that time.","The mind in itself wants nothing, unless it creates a want for itself; therefore it is both free from perturbation and unimpeded, if it does not perturb and impede itself.","Now departure from the world of men is nothing to fear, if gods exist: because they would not involve you in any harm. If they do not exist, or if they have no care for humankind, then what is life to me in a world devoid of gods, or devoid of providence? But they do exist, and they do care for humankind: and they have put it absolutely in man\'s power to avoid falling into the true kinds of harm.","Letting go all else, cling to the following few truths. Remember that man lives only in the present, in this fleeting instant: all the rest of his life is either past and gone, or not yet revealed. This mortal life is a little thing, lived in a little corner of the earth; and little, too, is the longest fame to come - dependent as it is on a succession of fast-perishing little men who have no knowledge even of their own selves, much less of one long dead and gone.","All those [events in history] were such dramas as we see now, only with different actors.","Consider thyself to be dead, and to have completed thy life up to the present time; and live according to nature the remainder which is allowed thee.","Consider how many do not even know your name, and how many will soon forget it, and how those who now praise you will presently blame you.","He who flies from his master is a runaway; but the law is master, and he who breaks the law is a runaway. And he also who is grieved or angry or afraid, is dissatisfied because something has been or is or shall be of the things which are appointed by Him who rules all things, and He is Law, and assigns to every man what is fit. He then who fears or is grieved or is angry is a runaway.","Continuously thou wilt look at human things as smoke and nothing at all; especially if thou reflectest at the same time, that what has once changed will never exist again in the infinite duration of time. But thou, in what a brief space of time is thy existence? And why art thou not content to pass through this short time in an orderly way?","Either all things proceed from one intelligent source and come together as in one body, and the part ought not to find fault with what is done for the benefit of the whole; or there are only atoms, and nothing else than a mixture and dispersion. Why, then, art thou disturbed? Say to this ruling faculty, Art thou dead, art thou corrupted, art thou playing the hypocrite, art thou become a beast, dost thou herd and feed with the rest?","All men are made one for another: either then teach them better or bear with them.","Each of us lives only now, this brief instant. The rest been lived already, or is impossible to see. The span we live is small - small as the corner of the earth in which we live it.","As for life, it is a battle and a sojourning in a strange land; but the fame that comes after is oblivion.","How barbarous, to deny men the privilege of pursuing what they imagine to be their proper concerns and interests!  Yet, in a sense, this is just what you are doing when you allow your indignation to rise at their wrongdoing; for after all, they are only following their own apparent concerns and interests. You say they are mistaken? Why then, tell them so, and explain it to them, instead of being indignant.","He who fears death either fears to lose all sensation or fears new sensations. In reality, you will either feel nothing at all, and therefore nothing evil, or else, if you can feel any sensations, you will be a new creature, and so will not have ceased to have life.","An angry look on the face is wholly against nature. If it be assumed frequently, beauty begins to perish, and in the end is quenched beyond rekindling.","Understand however that every man is worth just so much as the things are worth about which he busies himself.","Nature in no case cometh short of art, for the arts are copiers of natural forms.","No longer let thy breathing only act in concert with the air which surrounds thee, but let thy intelligence also now be in harmony with the intelligence which embraces all things. For the intelligent power is no less diffused in all parts and pervades all things for him who is willing to draw it to him than the a\xebrial power for him who is able to respire it.","The perfection of moral character consists in this, in passing every day as the last, and in being neither violently excited nor torpid nor playing the hypocrite.","Why dost thou not pray... to give thee the faculty of not fearing any of the things which thou fearest, or of not desiring any of the things which thou desirest, or not being pained at anything, rather than pray that any of these things should not happen or happen?","Let thine occupations be few, saith the sage, if thou wouldst lead a tranquil life.","In the case of most pains let this remark of Epicurus aid thee, that the pain is neither intolerable nor everlasting, if thou bear in mind that it has its limits, and if thou addest nothing to it in imagination.","Waste not the remnant of thy life in those imaginations touching other folk, whereby thou contributest not to the common weal.","Either an ordered Universe or a medley heaped together mechanically but still an order; or can order subsist in you and disorder in the Whole! And that, too, when all things are so distinguished and yet intermingled and sympathetic.","A little time, and thou shalt close thy eyes; and him who has attended thee to thy grave, another soon will lament.","Every being ought to do that which is according to its constitution; and all other things have been constituted for the sake of the superior, but the rational for the sake of one another.","Just consider, my friend, whether a pure spirit and virtue are anything other than saving your life and being saved. Perhaps we need to discard the idea of longevity and cease loving this life, instead committing these things to God and, believing that no one ever escapes destiny, to consider, with that in mind, how we may live the best possible life in the time that remains.","Death and life, success and failure, pain and pleasure, wealth and poverty, all these happen to good and bad alike, and they are neither noble nor shameful - and hence neither good nor bad.","Why should a man have any apprehension about the change and dissolution of all the elements? For it is according to nature, and nothing is evil which is according to nature.","You are making an inopportune rejection of what Nature has given you today, if all your mind is set on what men will say of you tomorrow.","The nature of the universe is the nature of things that are. Now, things that are have kinship with things that are from the beginning. Further, this nature is styled Truth; and it is the first cause of all that is true.","And can anything else that is useful be accomplished without change? Do you not see then that for yourself also to change is just the same, and equally necessary for the universal nature?","Thou art a little soul bearing about a corpse.","From Apollonius I learned freedom of will and undeviating steadiness of purpose; and to look to nothing else, not even for a moment, except to reason.","The man who doesn\'t know what the universe is doesn\'t know where he lives.","A lucky chance is constant in nothing but inconstancy.","I am an old man and have had many worries, but most have never come to pass.","Retire into thyself. The rational principle which rules has this nature, that it is content with itself when it does what is just, and so secures tranquility.","When men hate or blame you, or say hurtful things about you, look deeply into their hearts and see what kind of men they are. You\'ll see how unnecessary it is to strain after their good opinion. Yet you must still think kindly of them. they are your neighbors. The gods help them as they do you, by dreams and oracles, to win their hearts\' desires.","Not to waste time on nonsense. Not to be taken in by conjurors and hoodoo artists with their talk about incantations and exorcism and all the rest of it. Not to be obsessed with quail-fighting or other crazes like that.","I can at once become happy anywhere, for he is happy who has found himself a happy lot. In a word, happiness lies all in the functions of reason, in warrantable desires and virtuous practice.","When you find an unwillingness to rise early in the morning, endeavor to rouse your faculties, and act up to your kind, and consider that you have to do the business of a man; and that action is both beneficial and the end of your being.","To them that ask: Where hast thou seen the Gods, or how knowest thou certainly that there be Gods, that thou art so devout in their worship? I answer: Neither have I seen my own soul, and yet I respect and honor it.","Wherever a man lives, he may live well.","Have I done something for the general interest? Well then I have had my reward. Let this always be present to thy mind, and never stop doing such good.","Thou mayest foresee... the things which will be. For they will certainly be of like form, and it is not possible that they should deviate from the order of things now: accordingly to have contemplated human life for forty years is the same as to have contemplated it for ten thousand years.","Praise adds nothing to beauty--makes it neither better nor worse.","Suppose that thou hast detached thyself from the natural unity... yet here there is this beautiful provision, that it is in thy power again to unite thyself. God has allowed this to no other part, after it has been separated and cut asunder, to come together again. ...he has distinguished man, for he has put it in his power not to be separated at all from the universal ...he has allowed him to be returned and to be united and to resume his place as a part.","Death, like birth, is one of nature\'s mysteries, the combining of primal elements and dissolving of the same into the same.","For outward show is a wonderful perverter of the reason.","Outward objects cannot take hold of the soul, nor force their passage into her, nor set any of her wheels going. No, the impression comes from herself, and it is her own motions which affect her. As for the contingencies of fortune, they are either great or little, according to the opinion she has of her own strength.","Today I escaped all circumstance, or rather I cast out all circumstance, for it was not outside me, but within my judgements.","Everything is interwoven, and the web is holy; none of its parts are unconnected. They are composed harmoniously, and together - they compose the world.","My being consists of matter and form, that is, of soul and body; annihilation will reach neither of them, for they were never produced out of nothing. The consequence is, that every part of me will serve to make something in the world; and this again will change into another part through an infinite succession of change. This constant method of alteration gave me my being, and my father before me, and so on to eternity backward: for I think I may speak thus, even though the world be confined within certain determinate periods.","He who follows reason in all things is both tranquil and active at the same time, and also cheerful and collected.","It is a shame for the soul to be first to give way in this life, when thy body does not give way.","Never forget that the universe is a single living organism possessed of one substance and one soul, holding all things suspended in a single consciousness and creating all things with a single purpose that they might work together spinning and weaving and knotting whatever comes to pass.","Pray look upon the plants and birds, the ants, spiders, and bees, and you will see them all exerting their nature, and busy in their station. Pray, shall not a man act like a man?","Is your cucumber bitter? Throw it away. Are there briars in your path? Turn aside. That is enough. Do not go on and ay, \'Why were things of this sort ever brought into the world?\'","Prize that which is best in the universe; and this is that which useth everything and ordereth everything.","Remember that even if you were to live for three thousand years, or thirty thousand, you could not lose any other life than the one you have, and there will be no other life after it. So the longest and the shortest lives are the same. The present moment is shared by all living creatures, but the time that is past is gone forever. No one can lose the past or the future, for if they don\'t belong to you, how can they be taken from you?","Mark how fleeting and paltry is the estate of man - yesterday in embryo, tomorrow a mummy or ashes. So for the hairsbreadth of time assigned to thee, live rationally, and part with life cheerfully, as drops the ripe olive, extolling the season that bore it and the tree that matured it.","Let thy chief fort and place of defense be a mind free from passions. A stronger place and better fortified than this, hath no man.","But that which is useful is the better.","We are too much accustomed to attribute to a single cause that which is the product of several, and the majority of our controversies come from that.","Things themselves cannot touch the soul, not in the least degree, nor have they admission to the soul nor can they turn or move the soul: it turns and moves itself alone and whatever judgment it may think proper to make, such it makes by remaking for itself the things that present themselves to it","Not even the vicissitudes of fortune are contrary to nature or to the providential ordering of the universe. It all flows from the gods, who determine what is needed for the welfare of the whole universe, of which you are a part.","It is the duty of men to love even those who injure them.","If unwilling to rise in the morning, say to thyself, \'I awake to do the work of a man.\'","It is not the weight of the future or the past that is pressing upon you, but ever that of the present alone. Even this burden, too, can be lessened if you confine it strictly to its own limits.","Enter others\' minds and let them enter yours.","Think nothing profitable to you which compels you to break a promise, to lose your self respect, to hate any person, to curse, to act the hypocrite.","It is man\'s peculiar duty to love even those who wrong him.","By a tranquil mind I mean nothing else than a mind well ordered.","Because your own strength is unequal to a task, do not assume it is beyond the powers of man.","Reflect frequently upon the instability of things, and how very fast the scenes of nature are shifted. Matter is in perpetual flux. Change is always and everywhere at work; it strikes through causes and effects, and leaves nothing fixed and permanent.","No one can lose either the past or the future - how could anyone be deprived of what he does not possess? ... It is only the present moment of which either stands to be deprived: and if this is all he has, he cannot lose what he does not have.","From Apollonius I learned freedom of will and undeviating steadiness of purpose; and to look to nothing else, not even for a moment, except to reason; and to be always the same, in sharp pains, on the occasion of the loss of a child, and in long illness.","Keep in mind how fast things pass by and are gone - those that are now, and those to come. Existence flows past us like a river; the \\"what\\" is in constant flux, the \\"why\\" has a thousand variations. Nothing is stable, not even what\'s right here. The infinity of past and future gapes before us - a chasm whose depths we cannot see.","Love the people with whom fate brings you together","Unhappy am I because this has happened to me.- Not so, but happy am I, though this has happened to me, because I continue free from pain, neither crushed by the present nor fearing the future.","What is not good for the swarm is not good for the bee.","...in the ways of Nature there is no evil to be found.","Where life is possible at all, a right life is possible; life in a palace is possible; therefore even in a palace a right life is possible.","Don\'t let your imagination to be crushed by life as a whole. Don\'t try to pictures everything bad that could possibly happen. Stick with the situation at hand. ...Then remind yourself that past and present have no power over you. Only the present.","A man\'s happiness,-to do the things proper to man.","Hast thou reason? I have. Why then dost not thou use it? For if this does its own work, what else dost thou wish?","Though thou be destined to live three thousand years and as many myriads besides, yet remember that no man loseth other life than that which he liveth, nor liveth other than that which he loseth.","Wilt thou, then, my soul, never be good and simple and one and naked, more manifest than the body which surrounds thee?","Each of us needs what nature gives us, when nature gives us.","It is not the actions of others which trouble us (for those actions are controlled by their governing part), but rather it is our own judgments. Therefore remove those judgments and resolve to let go of your anger, and it will already be gone. How do you let go? By realizing that such actions are not shameful to you.","They know not how many things are signified by the words stealing, sowing, buying, keeping quiet, seeing what ought to be done; for this is not effected by the eyes, but by another kind of vision.","When forced, as it seems, by your environment to be utterly disquieted, return with all speed into your self, staying in discord no longer than you must. By constant recurrence to the harmony, you will gain more command over it.","Light may earth\'s crumbling sand be laid on thee, that dogs may dig thy bones up easily","Above, below, all around are the movements of the elements. But the motion of virtue is in none of these: it is something more divine, and advancing by a way hardly observed it goes happily on its road.","The universal nature has no external space; but the wondrous part of her art is that though she has circumscribed herself, everything which is within her which appears to decay and to grow old and to be useless she changes into herself, and again makes other new things from these very same, so that she requires neither substance from without nor wants a place into which she may cast that which decays. She is content then with her own space, and her own matter, and her own art.","All things are changing; and thou thyself art in continuous mutation and in a manner in continuous destruction and the whole universe to.","Am I doing anything? I do it with reference to the good of mankind. Does anything happen to me? I receive it and refer it to the gods, and the source of all things, from which all that happens is derived.","...small too even the longest fame thereafter, which is itself subject to a succession of little men who quickly die, and have no knowledge of themselves, let alone of those long dead.","And yet, after all, what is posthumous fame? Altogether vanity.","The true joy of humankind is in doing that which is most proper to our nature; and the first property of people is to be kindly affected towards them that are of one kind with ourselves.","The body of an actor can be either his best friend or his worst enemy.","Think not so much of what thou hast not as of what thou hast: but of the things which thou hast, select the best, and then reflect how eagerly they would have been sought, if thou hadst them not. At the same time, however, take care that thou dost not, through being so pleased with them, accustom thyself to overvalue them, so as to be disturbed if ever thou shouldst not have them.","As the same fire assumes different shapes When it consumes objects differing in shape, So does the one Self take the shape Of every creature in whom he is present.","Embellish the soul with simplicity, with prudence, and everything which is neither virtuous nor vicious. Love all men. Walk according to God; for, as a poet hath said, his laws govern all.","A man is a little soul carrying around a courpse.","Deem not life a thing of consequence. For look at the yawning void of the future, and at that other limitless space, the past.","If any man has done wrong, the harm is his own. But perhaps he has not done wrong.","When we consider we are bound to be serviceable to mankind, and bear with their faults, we shall perceive there is a common tie of nature and relation between us.","Remember that all is opinion. For what was said by the Cynic Monimus is manifest: and manifest too is the use of what was said, if a man receives what may be got out of it as far as it is true.","If I and my two children cannot move the gods, the gods must have their reasons.","Everything is here for a purpose, from horses to vine shoots. What\'s surprising about that? Even the sun will tell you, \\"I have a purpose,\\" and the other goods as well.","Men seek out retreats for themselves in the country, by the seaside, on the moutains . . . But all this is unphilosophical to the last degree . . . when thou canst at a moment\'s notice retire into thyself.","I will march on in the path of nature till my legs sink under me, and then I shall be at rest, and expire into that air which has given me my daily breath.","What use do I put my soul to? It is a serviceable question this, and should frequently be put to oneself. How does my ruling part stand affected? And whose soul have I now? That of a child, or a young man, or a feeble woman, or of a tyrant, of cattle or wild beasts.","Let it judge that nothing is either bad or good which can happen equally to the bad man and the good. For that which happens equally to him who lives contrary to nature and to him who lives according to nature, is neither according to nature nor contrary to nature.","I search after truth, by which man never yet was harmed.","Remember that the sole life which a man can lose is that which he is living at the moment.","Remember that neither the future nor the past pains thee, but only the present. But this is reduced to a very little, if thou only circumscribest it, and chidest thy mind, if it is unable\\n to hold out against even this.","Just as the sand-dunes, heaped one upon another, hide each the first, so in life the former deeds are quickly hidden by those that follow after.","The whole universe is change and life itself is but what you deem it - either gratefully better than or bitterly worse than something else that you alone choose.","It is a ridiculous thing for a man not to fly from his own badness, which is indeed possible, but to fly from other men\'s badness, which is impossible.","The world is mere change, and this life, opinion.","You exist but as a part inherent in a greater whole. Do not live as though you had a thousand years before you. The common due impends; while you live, and while you may, be good.","That which had grown from the earth, to the earth, But that which has sprung from heavenly seed, Back to the heavenly realms returns. This is either a dissolution of the mutual involution of the atoms, or a similar dispersion of the unsentient elements.","As for literature, thefts cannot harm it, while the lapse of ages augments its value","Perhaps there are none more lazy, or more truly ignorant, than your everlasting readers.","Cinna wishes to seem poor, and is poor","To a rational being it is the same thing to act according to nature and according to reason.","In this flowing stream, then, on which there is no abiding, what is there of the things which hurry by on which a man would set a high price? It would be just as if a man should fall in love with one of the sparrows which fly by, but it has already passed out of sight.","When thou art offended at any man\'s fault, forthwith turn to thyself and reflect in what manner thou doest error thyself. For by attending to this thou wilt quickly forget thy anger, if this consideration is also added, that the man is compelled; for what else could he do? or, if thou art able, take away from him the compulsion.","Rememberest the gods, and that they wish not to be flattered, but wish all reasonable beings to be made like themselves; and... rememberest that what does the work of a fig-tree is a fig-tree, and that what does the work of a dog is a dog, and that what does the work of a bee is a bee, and that what does the work of a man is a man.","If this is neither my own badness, nor an effect of my own badness, and the common weal is not injured, why am I troubled about it? And what is the harm to the common weal?","As for others whose lives are not so ordered, he reminds himself constantly of the characters they exhibit daily and nightly at home and abroad, and of the sort of society they frequent; and the approval of such men, who do not even stand well in their own eyes, has no value for him.","Reason and the reasoning faculty need no foreign assistance, but are sufficient for their own purposes. They move within themselves, and make directly for the point in view. Wherefore, acts in accordance with them are called right acts, for they lead along the right road.","Ambition means tying your well-being to what other people say or do. Self-indulgence means tying it to the things that happen to you. Sanity means tying it to your own actions.","There are three relations [between thee and other things]: the one to the body which surrounds thee; the second to the divine cause from which all things come to all; and the third to those who live with thee.","This is enough. Do not add, And why were such things made in the world?","Turn thy thoughts now to the consideration of thy life, thy life as a child, as a youth, thy manhood, thy old age, for in these also every change was a death. Is this anything to fear?","All that is not eternal is eternally out of date. C. S. LEWIS, The Four Loves Life is short. Eternity is long. BENTLEY LITTLE, His Father\'s Son What we do now echoes in eternity.","Reflect often upon the rapidity with which all existing things, or things coming into existence, sweep past us and are carried away.","Let there be freedom from perturbations with respect to the things which come from the external cause; and let there be justice in the things done by virtue of the internal cause, that is, let there be movement and action terminating in this, in social acts, for this is according to thy nature.","On the occasion of every act ask thyself, How is this with respect to me? Shall I repent of it? A little time and I am dead, and all is gone.","It were well to die if there be gods, and sad to live if there be none.","Vex not thy spirit at the course of things, they heed not thy vexations","If souls continue to exist, how does the air contain them from eternity?","Our wills are ours, to make them Thine.","Pass then through this little space of time conformably to nature, and end thy journey in content, just as an olive falls off when it is ripe, blessing nature who produced it, and thanking the tree on which it grew.","The universal nature out of the universal substance, as if it were wax, now molds a horse, and when it has broken this up, it uses the material for a tree, then for a man, then for something else.","Spend your brief moment according to nature\'s law, and serenely greet the journey\'s end as an olive falls when it is ripe, blessing the branch that bare it, and giving thanks to the tree that gave it life.","How soon will time cover all things.","Doth perfect beauty stand in need of praise at all? Nay; no more than law, no more than truth, no more than loving kindness, nor than modesty.","The rottenness of the matter which is the foundation of everything!","Depart then satisfied, for he also who releases thee is satisfied.","It is a base thing for the countenance to be obedient and to regulate and compose itself as the mind commands, and for the mind not to be regulated and composed by itself.","Be not as one that hath ten thousand years to live; death is nigh at hand: while thou livest, while thou hast time, be good.","God sees the minds (ruling principles) of all men bared of the material vesture and rind and impurities. For with his intellectual part alone he touches the intelligence only which has flowed and been derived from himself into these bodies. And if thou also usest thyself to do this, thou wilt rid thyself of thy much trouble. For he who regards not the poor flesh which envelops him, surely will not trouble himself by looking after raiment and dwelling and fame and such like externals and show.","Thanks to the gods I didn\'t spend much time while growing up with my grandfather\'s mistress and preserved the flower of my youth, waiting for the proper time to demonstrate my virility.","In death, Alexander of Macedon\'s end differed no whit from his stable-boy\'s. Either both were received into the same generative principle of the universe, or both alike were dispersed into atoms.","A man should remove not only unnecessary acts, but also unnecessary thoughts, for then superfluous activity will not follow.","The art of living is more like wrestling than dancing, in so far as it stands ready against the accidental and the unforeseen, and is not apt to fall.","As surgeons keep their instruments and knives always at hand for cases requiring immediate treatment, so shouldst thou have thy thoughts ready to understand things divine and human, remembering in thy every act, even the smallest, how close is the bond that unites the two.","When thou art above measure angry, bethink thee how momentary is man\'s life.","My only fear is doing something contrary to human nature - the wrong thing, the wrong way, or at the wrong time.","I am called to man\'s labour; why then do I make a difficulty if I am going out to do what I was born to do and what I was brought into the world for?","Every soul, the philosopher says, is involuntarily deprived of truth; consequently in the same way it is deprived of justice and temperance and benevolence and everything of the kind. It is most necessary to keep this in mind, for thus thou wilt be more gentle towards all.","We must press on then, in haste; not simply because every hour brings us nearer to death, but because even before then our powers of perception and comprehension begin to deteriorate.","The longest-lived and the shortest-lived man, when they come to die, lose one and the same thing.","All things change, and you yourself are constantly wasting away. So also is the universe.","Why should any of these things that happen externally distract thee? Give thyself leisure to learn some good thing: cease roving to and fro.","The cucumber is bitter? Then throw it out. There are brambles in the path? Then go around them. That\'s all you need to know. Nothing more. Don\'t demand to know \\"why such things exist.\\" Anyone who understands the world will laugh at you, just as a carpenter would if you seemed shocked at finding sawdust in his workshop, or a shoemaker at scraps of leather left over from work.","Be not unwilling in what thou doest, neither selfish nor unadvised nor obstinate; let not over-refinement deck out thy thought; be not wordy nor a busybody.","God overrules all mutinous accidents, brings them under His laws of fate, and makes them all serviceable to His purpose.","Men exist for each other. Then either improve them, or put up with them.","Flinch not, neither give up nor despair, if the achieving of every act in accordance with right principle is not always continuous with thee.","Do what nature now requires. Set thyself in motion, if it is in thy power, and do not look about thee to see if any one will observe it; nor yet expect Plato\'s Republic: but be content if the smallest thing goes on well, and consider such an event to be no small matter.","Waste no more time arguing about what a good man should be. Be one.","When you arise in the morning think of what a privilege it is to be alive, to think, to enjoy, to love ...","Accept the things to which fate binds you, and love the people with whom fate brings you together,but do so with all your heart.","The soul becomes dyed with the colour of its thoughts.","If someone is able to show me that what I think or do is not right, I will happily change, for I seek the truth, by which no one was ever truly harmed. It is the person who continues in his self-deception and ignorance who is harmed.","I have often wondered how it is that every man loves himself more than all the rest of men, but yet sets less value on his own opinion of himself than on the opinion of others.","Very little is needed to make a happy life; it is all within yourself in your way of thinking.","When you wake up in the morning, tell yourself: the people I deal with today will be meddling, ungrateful, arrogant, dishonest, jealous and surly. They are like this because they can\'t tell good from evil. But I have seen the beauty of good, and the ugliness of evil, and have recognized that the wrongdoer has a nature related to my own - not of the same blood and birth, but the same mind, and possessing a share of the divine. And so none of them can hurt me. No one can implicate me in ugliness. Nor can I feel angry at my relative, or hate him. We were born to work together like feet, hands and eyes, like the two rows of teeth, upper and lower. To obstruct each other is unnatural. To feel anger at someone, to turn your back on him: these are unnatural.","Reject your sense of injury and the injury itself disappears.","Here is a rule to remember in future, when anything tempts you to feel bitter: not \\"This is misfortune,\\" but \\"To bear this worthily is good fortune.","How much time he gains who does not look to see what his neighbour says or does or thinks, but only at what he does himself, to make it just and holy.","You are a little soul carrying about a corpse, as Epictetus used to say.","Do every act of your life as though it were the very last act of your life.","Begin each day by telling yourself: Today I shall be meeting with interference, ingratitude, insolence, disloyalty, ill-will, and selfishness \u2013 all of them due to the offenders\u2019 ignorance of what is good or evil. But for my part I have long perceived the nature of good and its nobility, the nature of evil and its meanness, and also the nature of the culprit himself, who is my brother (not in the physical sense, but as a fellow creature similarly endowed with reason and a share of the divine); therefore none of those things can injure me, for nobody can implicate me in what is degrading. Neither can I be angry with my brother or fall foul of him; for he and I were born to work together, like a man\u2019s two hands, feet or eyelids, or the upper and lower rows of his teeth. To obstruct each other is against Nature\u2019s law \u2013 and what is irritation or aversion but a form of obstruction.","Look back over the past, with its changing empires that rose and fell, and you can foresee the future too.","For it is in your power to retire into yourself whenever you choose.","The universe is change; our life is what our thoughts make it.","A man\u2019s worth is no greater than the worth of his ambitions.","Casting aside other things, hold to the precious few; and besides bear in mind that every man lives only the present, which is an indivisible point, and that all the rest of his life is either past or is uncertain. Brief is man\'s life and small the nook of the earth where he lives; brief, too, is the longest posthumous fame, buoyed only by a succession of poor human beings who will very soon die and who know little of themselves, much less of someone who died long ago.","Just that you do the right thing. The rest doesn\'t matter. Cold or warm. Tired or well-rested. Despised or honored. Dying...or busy with other assignments. Because dying, too, is one of our assignments in life. There as well: \\"To do what needs doing.\\" Look inward. Don\'t let the true nature of anything elude you. Before long, all existing things will be transformed, to rise like smoke (assuming all things become one), or be dispersed in fragments...to move from one unselfish act to another with God in mind. Only there, delight and stillness...when jarred, unavoidably, by circumstances, revert at once to yourself, and don\'t lose the rhythm more than you can help. You\'ll have a better grasp of the harmony if you keep going back to it.","Do not act as if you had ten thousand years to throw away. Death stands at your elbow. Be good for something while you live and it is in your power.","At dawn, when you have trouble getting out of bed, tell yourself: \u201cI have to go to work \u2014 as a human being. What do I have to complain of, if I\u2019m going to do what I was born for \u2014 the things I was brought into the world to do? Or is this what I was created for? To huddle under the blankets and stay warm?So you were born to feel \u201cnice\u201d? Instead of doing things and experiencing them? Don\u2019t you see the plants, the birds, the ants and spiders and bees going about their individual tasks, putting the world in order, as best they can? And you\u2019re not willing to do your job as a human being? Why aren\u2019t you running to do what your nature demands?You don\u2019t love yourself enough. Or you\u2019d love your nature too, and what it demands of you.\u201d","The things you think about determine the quality of your mind.","Whoever does wrong, wrongs himself; whoever does injustice, does it to himself, making himself evil.","Observe always that everything is the result of change, and get used to thinking that there is nothing Nature loves so well as to change existing forms and make new ones like them.","It never ceases to amaze me: we all love ourselves more than other people, but care more about their opinion than our own.","Do not waste what remains of your life in speculating about your neighbors, unless with a view to some mutual benefit. To wonder what so-and-so is doing and why, or what he is saying, or thinking, or scheming\u2014in a word, anything that distracts you from fidelity to the ruler within you\u2014means a loss of opportunity for some other task.","Choose not to be harmed\u2014and you won\u2019t feel harmed. Don\u2019t feel harmed\u2014and you haven\u2019t been.","Dig within. Within is the wellspring of Good; and it is always ready to bubble up, if you just dig.","Death smiles at us all; all we can do is smile back.","Concentrate every minute like a Roman\u2014 like a man\u2014 on doing what\u2019s in front of you with precise and genuine seriousness, tenderly, willingly, with justice. And on freeing yourself from all other distractions. Yes, you can\u2014 if you do everything as if it were the last thing you were doing in your life, and stop being aimless, stop letting your emotions override what your mind tells you, stop being hypocritical, self-centered , irritable. You see how few things you have to do to live a satisfying and reverent life? If you can manage this, that\u2019s all even the gods can ask of you.","Do not disturb yourself by picturing your life as a whole; do not assemble in your mind the many and varied troubles which have come to you in the past and will come again in the future, but ask yourself with regard to every present difficulty: \'What is there in this that is unbearable and beyond endurance?\' You would be ashamed to confess it! And then remind yourself that it is not the future or what has passed that afflicts you, but always the present, and the power of this is much diminished if you take it in isolation and call your mind to task if it thinks that it cannot stand up to it when taken on its own.","When you arise in the moring, think of what a precious privelege it is to be alive-- to breathe, to think, to enjoy, to love","Men seek retreats for themselves, houses in the country, sea-shores, and mountains; and thou too art wont to desire such things very much. But this is altogether a mark of the most common sort of men, for it is in thy power whenever thou shalt choose to retire into thyself. For nowhere either with more quiet or more freedom from trouble does a man retire than into his own soul, particularly when he has within him such thoughts that by looking into them he is immediately in perfect tranquility; and I affirm that tranquility is nothing else than the good ordering of the mind. Constantly then give to thyself this retreat, and renew thyself; and let thy principles be brief and fundamental, which, as soon as thou shalt recur to them, will be sufficient to cleanse the soul completely, and to send thee back free from all discontent with the things to which thou returnest. For with what art thou discontented? With the badness of men? Recall to thy mind this conclusion, that rational animals exist for one another, and that to endure is a part of justice, and that men do wrong involuntarily; and consider how many already, after mutual enmity, suspicion, hatred, and fighting, have been stretched dead, reduced to ashes; and be quiet at last.- But perhaps thou art dissatisfied with that which is assigned to thee out of the universe.- Recall to thy recollection this alternative; either there is providence or atoms, fortuitous concurrence of things; or remember the arguments by which it has been proved that the world is a kind of political community, and be quiet at last.- But perhaps corporeal things will still fasten upon thee.- Consider then further that the mind mingles not with the breath, whether moving gently or violently, when it has once drawn itself apart and discovered its own power, and think also of all that thou hast heard and assented to about pain and pleasure, and be quiet at last.- But perhaps the desire of the thing called fame will torment thee.- See how soon everything is forgotten, and look at the chaos of infinite time on each side of the present, and the emptiness of applause, and the changeableness and want of judgement in those who pretend to give praise, and the narrowness of the space within which it is circumscribed, and be quiet at last. For the whole earth is a point, and how small a nook in it is this thy dwelling, and how few are there in it, and what kind of people are they who will praise thee.","Life is opinion.","When people injure you, ask yourself what good or harm they thought would come of it. If you understand that, you\'ll feel sympathy rather than outrage or anger. Your sense of good and evil may be the same as theirs, or near it, in which case you have to excuse them. Or your sense of good and evil may differ from theirs. In which case they\'re misguided and deserve your compassion. Is that so hard?","How ridiculous and unrealistic is the man who is astonished at anything that happens in life.","Think of your many years of procrastination; how the gods have repeatedly granted you further periods of grace, of which you have taken no advantage. It is time now to realise the nature of the universe to which you belong, and of that controlling Power whose offspring you are; and to understand that your time has a limit set to it. Use it, then, to advance your enlightenment; or it will be gone, and never in your power again.","At dawn, when you have trouble getting out of bed, tell yourself: \u2018I have to go to work\u2014as a human being. What do I have to complain of, if I\u2019m going to do what I was born for\u2014the things I was brought into the world to do? Or is this what I was created for? To huddle under the blankets and stay warm? \u2014But it\u2019s nicer here\u2026So you were born to feel \u2018nice\u2019? Instead of doings things and experiencing them? Don\u2019t you see the plants, the birds, the ants and spiders and bees going about their individual tasks, putting the world in order, as best they can? And you\u2019re not willing to do your job as a human being? Why aren\u2019t you running to do what your nature demands? \u2014But we have to sleep sometime\u2026Agreed. But nature set a limit on that\u2014as it did on eating and drinking. And you\u2019re over the limit. You\u2019ve had more than enough of that. But not of working. There you\u2019re still below your quota. You don\u2019t love yourself enough. Or you\u2019d love your nature too, and what it demands of you. People who love what they do wear themselves down doing it, they even forget to wash or eat. Do you have less respect for your own nature than the engraver does for engraving, the dancer for dance, the miser for money or the social climber for status? When they\u2019re really possessed by what they do, they\u2019d rather stop eating and sleeping than give up practicing their arts.","Human life. Duration: momentary. Nature: changeable. Perception: dim. Condition of Body: decaying. Soul: spinning around. Fortune: unpredictable. Lasting Fame: uncertain. Sum Up: The body and its parts are a river, the soul a dream and mist, life is warfare and a journey far from home, lasting reputation is oblivion.","Adapt yourself to the life you have been given; and truly love the people with whom destiny has surrounded you","It loved to happen.","Don\u2019t let yourself forget how many doctors have died, furrowing their brows over how many deathbeds. How many astrologers, after pompous forecasts about others\u2019 ends. How many philosophers, after endless disquisitions on death and immortality. How many warriors, after inflicting thousands of casualties themselves. How many tyrants, after abusing the power of life and death atrociously, as if they were themselves immortal.How many whole cities have met their end: Helike, Pompeii, Herculaneum, and countless others.And all the ones you know yourself, one after another. One who laid out another for burial, and was buried himself, and then the man who buried him - all in the same short space of time.In short, know this: Human lives are brief and trivial. Yesterday a blob of semen; tomorrow embalming fluid, ash.To pass through this brief life as nature demands. To give it up without complaint.Like an olive that ripens and falls.Praising its mother, thanking the tree it grew on.","Neither worse then or better is a thing made by being praised.","Do not think that what is hard for you to master is humanly impossible; and if it is humanly possible, consider it to be within your reach.","That which is not good for the swarm, neither is it good for the bee.- Book VI, 54.","How unlucky I am that this should happen to me. But not at all. Perhaps, say how lucky I am that I am not broken by what has happened, and I am not afraid of what is about to happen. For the same blow might have stricken anyone, but not many would have absorbed it without capitulation and complaint.","When you arise in the morning, think of what a precious privilege it is to be alive-to breathe, to think, to enjoy, to love.","The happiness of your life depends upon the quality of your thoughts; therefore guard accordingly.","Remember two things: i. that everything has always been the same, and keeps recurring, and it makes no difference whether you see the same things recur in a hundred years or two hundred, or in an infinite period; ii. that the longest-lived and those who will die soonest lose the same thing. The present is all that they can give up, since that is all you have, and what you do not have you cannot lose.","Stop wandering about! You aren\'t likely to read your own notebooks, or ancient histories, or the anthologies you\'ve collected to enjoy in your old age. Get busy with life\'s purpose, toss aside empty hopes, get active in your own rescue-if you care for yourself at all-and do it while you can.","Everything that happens, happens as it should, and if you observe carefully, you will find this to be so.","You need to avoid certain things in your train of thought: everything random, everything irrelevant. And certainly everything self-important or malicious. You need to get used to winnowing your thoughts, so that if someone says, \\"What are your thinking about?\\" you can respond at once (and truthfully) that you are thinking this or thinking that.","Remember how long you\u2019ve been putting this off, how many extensions the gods gave you, and you didn\u2019t use them. At some point you have to recognize what world it is that you belong to; what power rules it and from what source you spring; that there is a limit to the time assigned to you, and if you don\u2019t use it to free yourself it will be gone and will never return.","Kindness is unconquerable, so long as it is without flattery or hypocrisy. For what can the most insolent man do to you, if you contrive to be kind to him, and if you have the chance gently advise and calmly show him what is right...and point this out tactfully and from a universal perspective. But you must not do this with sarcasm or reproach, but lovingly and without anger in your soul.","Whenever you want to cheer yourself up, consider the good qualities of your companions, for example, the energy of one, the modesty of another, the generosity of yet another, and some other quality of another; for nothing cheers the heart as much as the images of excellence reflected in the character of our companions, all brought before us as fully as possible. Therefore, keep these images ready at hand.","When force of circumstance upsets your equanimity, lose no time in recovering your self-control, and do not remain out of tune longer than you can help. Habitual recurrence to the harmony will increase your mastery of it.","Asia and Europe: tiny corners of the Cosmos. Every sea: a mere drop. Mount Athos: a lump of dirt. The present moment is the smallest point in all eternity. All is microscopic, changeable, disappearing. All things come from that faraway place, either originating directly from that governing part which is common to all, or else following from it as consequences. So even the gaping jaws of the lion, deadly poison, and all harmful things like thorns or an oozing bog are products of that awesome and noble source. Do not imagine these things to be alien to that which you revere, but turn your Reason to the source of all things.","Everything is only for a day, both that which remembers and that which is remembered.\\"Observe constantly that all things take place by change, and accustom thyself to consider that the nature of the universe loves nothing so much as to change things which are and to make new things like them. For everything that exists is in a manner the seed of that which will be.","Because your own strength is unequal to the task, do not assume that it is beyond the powers of man; but if anything is within the powers and province of man, believe that it is within your own compass also. Marcus Aurelius","It\u2019s the truth I\u2019m after, and the truth never harmed anyone. What harms us is to persist in self-deceit and ignorance.","The time of a man\'s life is as a point; the substance of it ever flowing, the sense obscure; and the whole composition of the body tending to corruption. His soul is restless, fortune uncertain, and fame doubtful; to be brief, as a stream so are all things belonging to the body; as a dream, or as a smoke, so are all that belong unto the soul. Our life is a warfare, and a mere pilgrimage. Fame after life is no better than oblivion. What is it then that will adhere and follow? Only one thing, philosophy. And philosophy doth consist in this, for a man to preserve that spirit which is within him, from all manner of contumelies and injuries, and above all pains or pleasures; never to do anything either rashly, or feignedly, or hypocritically: only to depend from himself, and his own proper actions: all things that happen unto him to embrace contentendly, as coming from Him from whom he himself also came; and above all things, with all meekness and a calm cheerfulness, to expect death, as being nothing else but the resolution of those elements, of which every creature is composed. And if the elements themselves suffer nothing by their perpetual conversion of one into another, that dissolution, and alteration, which is so common unto all, why should it be feared by any? Is not this according to nature? But nothing that is according to nature can be evil.","All of us are creatures of a day; the rememberer and the remembered alike. All is ephemeral\u2014both memory and the object of memory. The time is at hand when you will have forgotten everything; and the time is at hand when all will have forgotten you. Always reflect that soon you will be no one, and nowhere.","Today I escaped anxiety. Or no, I discarded it, because it was within me, in my own perceptions \u2014 not outside.","Everything in any way beautiful has its beauty of itself, inherent and self-sufficient: praise is no part of it. At any rate, praise does not make anything better or worse. This applies even to the popular conception of beauty, as in material things or works of art. So does the truly beautiful need anything beyond itself? No more than law, no more than truth, no more than kindness or integrity. Which of these things derives its beauty from praise, or withers under criticism? Does an emerald lose its quality if it is not praised? And what of gold, ivory, purple, a lyre, a dagger, a flower, a bush?","It is my bad luck that this has happened to me.\' No, you should rather say: \'It is my good luck that, although this has happened to me, I can bear it without pain, neither crushed by the present nor fearful of the future.\' Because such a thing could have happened to any man, but not every man could have borne it without pain. So why see more misfortune in the event than good fortune in your ability to bear it?","Look to nothing, not even for a moment except to reason.","Our actions may be impeded... But there can be no impeding our intentions or our dispositions. Because we can accommodate and adapt. The mind adapts and converts to its own purposes the obstacle to our acting.The impeding to action advances action.What stands in the way becomes the way.","Will any man despise me? Let him see to it. But I will see to it that I may not be found doing or saying anything that deserves to be despised.","The best revenge is not to do as they do.","In your actions, don\'t procrastinate. In your conversations, don\'t confuse. In your thoughts, don\'t wander. In your soul, don\'t be passive or aggressive. In your life, don\'t be all about business.","You could leave life right now. Let that determine what you do and say and think.","Be your own master, and look at things as a man, as a human being, as a citizen, as a mortal creature.","In a sense, people are our proper occupation. Our job is to do them good and put up with them.But when they obstruct our proper tasks, they become irrelevant to us\u2014like sun, wind, animals. Our actions may be impeded by them, but there can be no impeding our intentionsor our dispositions. Because we can accommodate and adapt. The mind adapts and converts to its own purposes theobstacle to our acting.The impediment to action advances action.What stands in the way becomes the way.","In everything that you do, pause and ask yourself if death is a dreadful thing because it deprives you of this","In the human life time is but an instant, and the substance of it a flux, and the perception dull, and the composition of the whole body subject to putrefaction, and the soul a whirl, and fortune hard to divine, and fame a thing devoid of certainty. And, to say all in a word, everything that belongs to the body is a stream, and what belongs to the soul is a dream and vapor, and life is a warfare and a stranger\'s sojourn, and after- fame is oblivion. What then can guide a man? One thing and only one, philosophy.","We must make haste then, not only because we are daily nearer to death, but also because the conception of things and the understanding of them cease first.","Soon, you will have forgotten everything. Soon, everybody will have forgotten you.","The sexual embrace can only be compared with music and with prayer.","At dawn, when you have trouble getting out of bed, tell yourself: \u201cI have to go to work\u2014as a human being. What do I have to complain of, if I\u2019m going to do what I was born for\u2014 the things I was brought into the world to do? Or is this what I was created for? To huddle under the blankets and stay warm?\u2014But it\u2019s nicer here. . . .So you were born to feel \u201cnice? Instead of doing things and experiencing them? Don\u2019t you see the plants, the birds, the ants and spiders and bees going about their individual tasks, putting the world in order, as best they can? And you\u2019re not willing to do your job as a human being? Why aren\u2019t you running to do what your nature demands?\u2014But we have to sleep sometime. . . .Agreed. But nature set a limit on that\u2014as it did on eating and drinking. And you\u2019re over the limit. You\u2019ve had more than enough of that. But not of working. There you\u2019re still below your quota.You don\u2019t love yourself enough. Or you\u2019d love your nature too, and what it demands of you. People who love what they do wear themselves down doing it, they even forget to wash or eat. Do you have less respect for your own nature than the engraver does for engraving, the dancer for the dance, the miser for money or the social climber for status? When they\u2019re really possessed by what they do, they\u2019d rather stop eating and sleeping than give up practicing their arts. Is helping others less valuable to you? Not worth your effort?\u201d","If any man is able to convince me and show me that I do not think or act right, I will gladly change; for I seek the truth by which no man was ever injured. But he is injured who abides in his error and ignorance.","40. The gods either have power or they have not. If they have not, why pray to them? If they have, then instead of praying to be granted or spared such-and-such a thing, why not rather pray to be delivered from dreading it, or lusting for it, or grieving over it? Clearly, if they can help a man at all, they can help him in this way. You will say, perhaps, \u2018But all that is something they have put in my own power.\u2019 Then surely it were better to use your power and be a free man, than to hanker like a slave and a beggar for something that is not in your power. Besides, who told you the gods never lend their aid even towards things that do lie in our own power? Begin praying in this way, and you will see. Where another man prays \u2018Grant that I may possess this woman,\u2019 let your own prayer be, \u2018Grant that I may not lust to possess her.\u2019 Where he prays, \u2018Grant me to be rid of such-and-such a one,\u2019 you pray, \u2018Take from me my desire to be rid of him.\u2019 Where he begs, \u2018Spare me the loss of my precious child,\u2019 beg rather to be delivered from the terror of losing him. In short, give your petitions a turn in this direction, and see what comes.","How good it is when you have roast meat or suchlike foods before you, to impress on your mind that this is the dead body of a fish, this is the dead body of a bird or pig; and again, that the Falernian wine is the mere juice of grapes, and your purple edged robe simply the hair of a sheep soaked in shell-fish blood!And in sexual intercourse that it is no more than the friction of a membrane and a spurt of mucus ejected. How good these perceptions are at getting to the heart of the real thing and penetrating through it, so you can see it for what it is!This should be your practice throughout all your life: when things have such a plausible appearance, show them naked, see their shoddiness, strip away their own boastful account of themselves.Vanity is the greatest seducer of reason: when you are most convinced that your work is important, that is when you are most under its spell.","Don\u2019t let your imagination be crushed by life as a whole. Don\u2019t try to picture everything bad that could possibly happen. Stick with the situation at hand, and ask, \u201cWhy is this so unbearable? Why can\u2019t I endure it? You\u2019ll be embarrassed to answer. Then remind yourself that past and future have no power over you. Only the present\u2014and even that can be minimized. Just mark off its limits.\u201d","He is so rich, he has no room to shit.","Frequently consider the connection of all things in the Universe. ... Reflect uponthe multitude of bodily and mental events taking place in the same brief time,simultaneously in every one of us and so you will not be surprised that manymore events, or rather all things that come to pass, exist simultaneously in theone and entire unity, which we call the Universe. ... We should not say \u2018I am anAthenian\u2019 or \u2018I am a Roman\u2019 but \u2018I am a Citizen of the Universe\'.","Kindness is invincible.","If something is difficult for you to accomplish, do not then think it impossible for any human being; rather, if it is humanly possible and corresponds to human nature, know that it is attainable by you as well.","Whatever time you choose is the right time. Not late, not early.","If anyone can refute me\u2014show me I\u2019m making a mistake or looking at things from the wrong perspective\u2014I\u2019ll gladly change. It\u2019s the truth I\u2019m after, and the truth never harmed anyone. What harms us is to persist in self-deceit and ignorance.","In the morning when thou risest unwillingly, let this thought be present,\u2014I am rising to the work of a human being. Why then am I dissatisfied if I am going to do the things for which I exist and for which I was brought into the world? Or have I been made for this, to lie in the bed-clothes and keep myself warm?\u2014But this is more pleasant.\u2014Dost thou exist then to take thy pleasure, and not at all for action or exertion? Dost thou not see the little plants, the little birds, the ants, the spiders, the bees working together to put in order their several parts of the universe? And art thou unwilling to do the work of a human being, and dost thou not make haste to do that which, is according to thy nature? But it is necessary to take rest also.\u2014It is necessary. However, Nature has fixed bounds to this too: she has fixed bounds to eating and drinking, and yet thou goest beyond these bounds, beyond what is sufficient; yet in thy acts it is not so, but thou stoppest short of what thou canst do. So thou lovest not thyself, for if thou didst, thou wouldst love thy nature and her will. But those who love their several arts exhaust themselves in working at them unwashed and without food; but thou valuest thy own nature less than the turner values the turning art, or the dancer the dancing art, or the lover of money values his money, or the vain-glorious man his little glory. And such men, when they have a violent affection to a thing, choose neither to eat nor to sleep rather than to perfect the things which they care for. But are the acts which concern society more vile in thy eyes and less worthy of thy labor?","Whatever is in any way beautiful hath its source of beauty in itself, and is complete in itself; praise forms no part of it. So it is none the worse nor the better for being praised.","When you run up against someone else\u2019s shamelessness, ask yourself this: Is a world without shamelessness possible?No. Then don\u2019t ask the impossible. There have to be shameless people in the world. This is one of them. The same for someone vicious or untrustworthy, or with any other defect. Remembering that the whole world class has to exist will make you more tolerant of its members.","Do the things external which fall upon thee distract thee? Give thyself time to learn something new and good, and cease to be whirled around.","I can control my thoughts as necessary; then how can I be troubled? What is outside my mind means nothing to it. Absorb that lesson and your feet stand firm.","Nothing is more scandalous than a man that is proud of his humility.","...life is a warfare and a stranger\'s sojourn, and after-fame is oblivion.","From my great-grandfather: not to have attended schools for the public; to have had good teachers at home, and to realize that this is the sort of thing on which one should spend lavishly.","Your life is what your thoughts make it","Objective judgment, now, at this very moment. Unselfish action, now, at this very moment. Willing acceptance\u2014now, at this very moment\u2014of all external events. That\u2019s all you need.","This thing, what is it in itself, in its own constitution? What is its substance and material?","A Man\'s life is dyed the color of his imagination.","To be like the rock that the waves keep crashing over. It stands unmoved and the raging of the sea falls still around it.","Never let the future disturb you - you will meet it with the same weapons of reason and mind that, today, guard you against the present...","Even if you\u2019re going to live three thousand more years, or ten times that, remember: you cannot lose another life than the one you\u2019re living now, or live another one than the one you\u2019re losing. The longest amounts to the same as the shortest. The present is the same for everyone; its loss is the same for everyone; and it should be clear that a brief instant is all that is lost. For you can\u2019t lose either the past or the future; how could you lose what you don\u2019t have?","Live every day as if they last.","Whether you are shivering with cold or too hot, sleepy or wide awake, spoken well of or badly, dying, or doing anything else, do not let it interfere with doing what is right. For whatever causes us to die is also one of life\'s processes. Even for this, nothing is required of us than to accomplish well the task at hand.","Every man is worth just so much as the things about which he busies himself.","To read with diligence; not to rest satisfied with a light and superficial knowledge, nor quickly to assent to things commonly spoken","Death hangs over thee. While thou livest, while it is in thy power, be good.","Give up your thirst for books, so that you do not die a grouch.","The man of ambition thinks to find his good in the operations of others; the man of pleasure in his own sensations; but the man of understanding in his own actions.","It is in your own power to maintain the beauty of your soul, or to be a decent human being.","Be cheerful also, and seek not external help nor the tranquility which others give. A man then must stand erect, not be kept erect by others.","True understanding is to see the events of life in this way: \'You are here for my benefit, though rumor paints you otherwise.\' And everything is turned to one\'s advantage when he greets a situation like this: You are the very thing I was looking for. Truly whatever arises in life is the right material to bring about your growth and the growth of those around you. This, in a word, is art-- and this art called \'life\' is a practice suitable to both men and gods. Everything contains some special purpose and a hidden blessing; what then could be strange or arduous when all of life is here to greet you like an old and faithful friend?","People look for retreats for themselves, in the country, by the coast, or in the hills. There is nowhere that a person can find a more peaceful and trouble-free retreat than in his own mind. . . . So constantly give yourself this retreat, and renew yourself.","Hour by hour resolve firmly to do what comes to hand with dignity, and with humanity, independence, and justice. Allow your mind freedom from all other considerations. This you can do, if you will approach each action as though it were your last, dismissing the desire to create an impression, the admiration of self, the discontent with your lot. See how little man needs to master, for his days to flow on in quietness and piety: he has but to observe these few counsels, and the gods will ask nothing more.","That all is as thinking makes it so \u2013 and you control your thinking.

The angryman seems to turn his back on reason out of a kind of painand inner convulsion. But the man motivated by desire, whois mastered by pleasure, seems somehow more self-indulgent, less manly in his sins. Theophrastus is right, andphilosophically sound, to say that the sin committed out ofpleasure deserves a harsher rebuke than the one committedout of pain. The angry man is more like a victim ofwrongdoing, provoked by pain to anger.

What\u2019s there to complain about? People\u2019s misbehavior? But take into consideration: \u2022 that rational beings exist for one another; \u2022 that doing what\u2019s right sometimes requires patience; \u2022 that no one does the wrong thing deliberately; \u2022 and the number of people who have feuded and envied and hated and fought and died and been buried. . . . and keep your mouth shut. Or are you complaining about the things the world assigns you? But consider the two options: Providence or atoms. And all the arguments for seeing the world as a city. Or is it your body? Keep in mind that when the mind detaches itself and realizes its own nature, it no longer has anything to do with ordinary life\u2014the rough and the smooth, either one. And remember all you\u2019ve been taught\u2014and accepted\u2014about pain and pleasure. Or is it your reputation that\u2019s bothering you? But look at how soon we\u2019re all forgotten. The abyss of endless time that swallows it all. The emptiness of all those applauding hands. The people who praise us\u2014how capricious they are, how arbitrary. And the tiny region in which it all takes place. The whole earth a point in space\u2014and most of it uninhabited. How many people there will be to admire you, and who they are. So keep this refuge in mind: the back roads of your self. Above all, no strain and no stress. Be straightforward. Look at things like a man, like a human being, like a citizen, like a mortal. And among the things you turn to, these two: i. That things have no hold on the soul. They stand there unmoving, outside it. Disturbance comes only from within\u2014from our own perceptions. ii. That everything you see will soon alter and cease to exist. Think of how many changes you\u2019ve already seen. \u201cThe world is nothing but change. Our life is only perception.","The offender needs pity, not wrath; those who must needs be corrected, should be treated with tact and gentleness; and one must be always ready to learn better. \'The best kind of revenge is, not to become like unto them.","no matter what anyone says or does, my task is to be good. like gold or emerald or purple repeating to itself, \\"no matter what anyone says or does, my task is to be emerald, my color undiminished.","Make for thyself a definition or description of the thing which is presented to thee, so as to see distinctly what kind of a thing it is in its substance, in its nudity, in its complete entirety, and tell thyself its proper name, and the names of the things of which it has been compounded, and into which it will be resolved. For nothing is so productive of elevation of mind as to be able to examine methodically and truly every object which is presented to thee in life, and always to look at things so as to see at the same time what kind of universe this is, and what kind of use everything performs in it, and what value everything has with reference to the whole, and what with reference to man, who is a citizen of the highest city, of which all other cities are like families; what each thing is, and of what it is composed, and how long it is the nature of this thing to endure which now makes an impression on me, and what virtue I have need of with respect to it, such as gentleness, manliness, truth, fidelity, simplicity, contentment, and the rest. ... If thou workest at that which is before thee, following right reason seriously, vigorously, calmly, without allowing anything else to distract thee, but keeping thy divine part pure, as if thou shouldst be bound to give it back immediately; if thou holdest to this, expecting nothing, fearing nothing, but satisfied with thy present activity according to nature, and with heroic truth in every word and sound which thou utterest, thou wilt live happy.

Human life. Duration: momentary. Nature: changeable. Perception: dim. Condition of Body: decaying. Soul: spinning around. Fortune: unpredictable. Lasting Fame: uncertain. Sum Up: The body and its parts are a river, the soul a dream and mist, life is warfare and a journey far from home, lasting reputation is oblivion. Then what can guide us? Only philosophy. Which means making sure that the power within stays safe and free from assault, superior to pleasure and pain, doing nothing randomly or dishonestly and with imposture, not dependent on anyone else\u2019s doing something or not doing it. And making sure that it accepts what happens and what it is dealt as coming from the same place it came from. And above all, that it accepts death in a cheerful spirit, as nothing but the dissolution of the elements from which each living thing is composed. If it doesn\u2019t hurt the individual elements to change continually into one another, why are people afraid of all of them changing and separating? It\u2019s a natural thing. And nothing natural is evil.","The universe is change, and life mere opinion","Yes, keep on degrading yourself, soul. But soon your chance at dignity will be gone. Everyone gets one life.

Nothing is asencouraging as when virtues are visibly embodied in thepeople around us, when we\u2019re practically showered withthem.It\u2019s good to keep this in mind.","But death and life, success and failure, pain and pleasure, wealth and poverty, all these happen to good and bad alike, and they are neither noble or shameful\u2014and hence neither good nor bad.","Within ten days you will seem a god to those to whom you are now a beast and an ape, if you will return to your principles and the worship of reason.","De multe ori am fost uimit de faptul ca fiecare, desi se iubeste pe sine insusi mai mult decat pe toti ceilalti, pune totusi mai putin pret pe propria parere despre sine decat pe parerea celorlalti despre el.","My soul, will you ever be good, simple, individual, bare, brighter than the body that covers you? Will you ever taste the disposition to love and affection? Will you ever be complete and free of need, missing nothing, desiring nothing live or lifeless for the enjoyment of pleasure?","8. It can ruin your life only if it ruins your character. Otherwise it cannot harm you\u2014inside or out.","All things fade into the storied past, and in a little while are shrouded in oblivion.","10. Forget everything else. Keep hold of this alone and remember it: Each of us lives only now, this brief instant. The rest has been lived already, or is impossible to see. The span we live is small\u2014small as the corner of the earth in which we live it. Small as even the greatest renown, passed from mouth to mouth by short-lived stick figures, ignorant alike of themselves and those long dead.","How much time he gains who does not look to see what his neighbor says or does or thinks, but only at what he does himself, to make it just and holy.","For times when you feel pain:See that it doesn\u2019t disgrace you, or degrade yourintelligence\u2014doesn\u2019t keep it from acting rationally orunselfishly.And in most cases what Epicurus said should help: thatpain is neither unbearable nor unending, as long as you keepin mind its limits and don\u2019t magnify them in your imagination.And keep in mind too that pain often comes in disguise\u2014as drowsiness, fever, loss of appetite. . . . When you\u2019rebothered by things like that, remind yourself: \u201cI\u2019m giving into pain.","What am I but a little flesh, a little breath, and the thinking part that rules the whole?","Look at the past\u2014empire succeeding empire\u2014and from that, extrapolate the future: the same thing.

It too is one of the things required by nature. Like youth and old age. Like growth and maturity. Like a new set of teeth, a beard, the first gray hair. Like sex and pregnancy and childbirth. Like all the other physical changes at each stage of life, our dissolution is no different. So this is how a thoughtful person should await death: not with indifference, not with impatience, not with disdain, but simply viewing it as one of the things that happen to us. Now you anticipate the child\u2019s emergence from its mother\u2019s womb; that\u2019s how you should await the hour when your soul will emerge from its compartment. Or perhaps you need some tidy aphorism to tuck away in the back of your mind. Well, consider two things that should reconcile you to death: the nature of the things you\u2019ll leave behind you, and the kind of people you\u2019ll no longer be mixed up with. There\u2019s no need to feel resentment toward them\u2014in fact, you should look out for their well-being, and be gentle with them\u2014but keep in mind that everything you believe is meaningless to those you leave behind. Because that\u2019s all that could restrain us (if anything could)\u2014the only thing that could make us want to stay here: the chance to live with those who share our vision. But now? Look how tiring it is\u2014this cacophony we live in. Enough to make you say to death, \u201cCome quickly. Before I start to forget myself, like them.","Take away thy opinion, and then there is taken away the complaint, \\"I have been harmed.\\" Take away the complaint, \\"I have been harmed,\\" and the harm is taken away. \xa0\xa0That which does not make a man worse than he was, also does not make his life worse, nor does it harm him either from without or from within.","Not to feel exasperated, or defeated, or despondent because your days aren\'t packed with wise and moral actions.

Or (more accurately) do what\u2019s essential\u2014what the logos of a social being requires, and in the requisite way. Which brings a double satisfaction: to do less, better. Because most of what we say and do is not essential. If you can eliminate it, you\u2019ll have more time, and more tranquillity. Ask yourself at every moment, \u201cIs this necessary?\u201d But we need to eliminate unnecessary assumptions as well. To eliminate the unnecessary actions that follow.\u201d","You have the power within you to endure anything, for your mere opinion can render it tolerable, perhaps even acceptable, by regarding it as an opportunity for enlightenment or a matter of duty.","To live a good life: We have the potential for it. If we can learn to be indifferent to what makes no difference. This is how we learn: by looking at each thing, both the parts and the whole. Keeping in mind that none of them can dictate how we perceive it. They don\u2019t impose themselves on us. They hover before us, unmoving. It is we who generate the judgments\u2014inscribing them on ourselves. And we don\u2019t have to. We could leave the page blank\u2014and if a mark slips through, erase it instantly. Remember how brief is the attentiveness required. And then our lives will end. And why is it so hard when things go against you? If it\u2019s imposed by nature, accept it gladly and stop fighting it. And if not, work out what your own nature requires, and aim at that, even if it brings you no glory. None of us is forbidden to pursue our own good.","When you start to lose your temper, remember: There\u2019s nothing manly about rage.

For if he shall begin to fall into dotage, perspiration and nutrition and imagination and appetite and whatever else there is of the kind will not fail; but the power of making use of ourselves, and filling up the measure of our duty, and clearly separating all appearances, and considering whether a man should now depart from life, and whatever else of the kind absolutely requires a disciplined reason, all this is already extinguished. We must make haste then, not only because we are daily nearer to death, but also because the conception of things and the understanding of them cease first.","Every hour be firmly resolved... to accomplish the work at hand with fitting and unaffected dignity, goodwill, freedom, justice. Banish from your thoughts all other considerations. This is possible if you perform each act as if it were your last, rejecting every frivolous distraction, every denial of the rule of reason, every pretentious gesture, vain show, and whining complaint against the decrees of fate. Do you see what little is required of a man to live a well-tempered and god-fearing life? Obey these precepts, and the gods will ask nothing more (II.5).","The present moment is the only thing of which anyone can be deprived, at least if this is the only thing he has and he cannot lose what he has not got.","Nowhere you can go is more peaceful\u2014more free of interruptions\u2014than your own soul. Especially","Whatever happens to you has been waiting to happen since the beginning of time. The twining strands of fate wove both of them together: your own existence and the things that happen to you","Disgraceful: for the soul to give up when the body is still going strong.","To stand up straight \u2014 not straightened","It should be a man\'s task, says the Imitation, \'to overcome himself, and every day to be stronger than himself.\' \'In withstanding of the passions standeth very peace of heart.\' \'Let us set the axe to the root, that we being purged of our passions may have a peaceable mind.\' To this end there must be continual self-examination. \'If thou may not continually gather thyself together, namely sometimes do it, at least once a day, the morning or the evening. In the morning purpose, in the evening discuss the manner, what thou hast been this day, in word, work, and thought.","Nature did not blend things so inextricably that you can\u2019t draw your own boundaries\u2014place your own well-being in your own hands. It\u2019s quite possible to be a good man without anyone realizing it. Remember that. And this too: you don\u2019t need much to live happily. And just because you\u2019ve abandoned your hopes of becoming a great thinker or scientist, don\u2019t give up on attaining freedom, achieving humility, serving others, obeying God.","Pride is a master of deception: when you think you\'re occupied in the weightiest business, that\'s when he has you in his spell.","Do unsavory armpits and bad breath make you angry?","Treat what you don\u2019t have as nonexistent. Look at whatyou have, the things you value most, and think of how muchyou\u2019d crave them if you didn\u2019t have them. But be careful.Don\u2019t feel such satisfaction that you start to overvalue them\u2014that it would upset you to lose them.","If you are distressed about anything, the pain is not due to the thing but to your own estimate of it.","Soon you\'ll be ashes or bones. A mere name at most - and even that is just a sound, an echo. The things we want in life are empty, stale, trivial.","If you set yourself to your present task along the path of true reason, with all determination, vigour,and good will: if you admit no distraction, but keep your own divinity pure and standing strong, as if you had to surrender it right now; if you grapple this to you, expecting nothing, shirking nothing, but self-content with each present action taken in accordance with nature and a heroic truthfulness in all that you say and mean - then you will lead a good life. And nobody is able to stop you.","You have power over your mind - not outside events. Realize this, and you will find strength.When you arise in the morning, think of what a precious privilege it is to be alive - to breathe, to think, to enjoy, to love.","The things ordained for you\u2014teach yourself to be at one with those. And the people who share them with you\u2014treat them with love. With real love.","recognize the malice, cunning, and hypocrisy that power produces, and the peculiar ruthlessness often shown by people from \u201cgood families.","Your three components: body, breath, mind. Two are yours in trust; to the third alone you have clear title. If you can cut yourself\u2014your mind\u2014free of what other people do and say, of what you\u2019ve said or done, of the things that you\u2019re afraid will happen, the impositions of the body that contains you and the breath within, and what the whirling chaos sweeps in from outside, so that the mind is freed from fate, brought to clarity, and lives life on its own recognizance\u2014doing what\u2019s right, accepting what happens, and speaking the truth\u2014 If you can cut free of impressions that cling to the mind, free of the future and the past\u2014can make yourself, as Empedocles says, \u201ca sphere rejoicing in its perfect stillness, and concentrate on living what can be lived (which means the present) . . . then you can spend the time you have left in tranquillity. And in kindness. And at peace with the spirit within you.\u201d","IN THE morning when thou risest unwillingly, let this thought be present- I am rising to the work of a human being. Why then am I dissatisfied if I am going to do the things for which I exist and for which I was brought into the world?","23. Keep in mind how fast things pass by and are gone\u2014those that are now, and those to come. Existence flows past us like a river: the \u201cwhat is in constant flux, the \u201cwhy\u201d has a thousand variations. Nothing is stable, not even what\u2019s right here. The infinity of past and future gapes before us\u2014a chasm whose depths we cannot see. So it would take an idiot to feel self-importance or distress. Or any indignation, either. As if the things that irritate us lasted. 24.\u201d","So here is a rule to remember in future, when anything tempts you to feel bitter: not, \u2018This is a misfortune,\u2019 but \u2018To bear this worthily is good fortune.","Even the least of our activities ought to have some end in view.","The fencer\u2019s weapon is picked up and put down again. The boxer\u2019s is part of him. All he has to do is clench his fist.","The Stoic discovers the model for his virtuous conduct in studying the laws of nature; just as each object, plant, and animal serves its fated role in the larger order, so the human strives to steer his actions in accordance with his unique power, reason, his inner mirror of the logos that governs the universe.","It is in our power to have no opinion about a thing and not to be disturbed in our soul; for things themselves have no natural power to form our judgments.","If you\u2019re honest and straightforward and mean well, it should show in your eyes. It should be unmistakable.","No matter what anyone says or does, my task is to be good.","Love the art, poor as it may be, that thou hast learned, and be content with it; and pass through the rest of life like one who has intrusted to the gods with his whole soul all that he has, making thyself neither the tyrant nor the slave of any man.","Say to yourself first thing in the morning: today I shall meet people who are meddling, ungrateful, aggressive, treacherous, malicious, unsocial. All this has afflicted them through their ignorance of true good and evil. But I have that the nature of good is what is right, and the nature of evil what is wrong; and I reflected that the nature of the offender himself is akin to my own -- not a kinship of blood or seed, but a sharing in the same mind, the same fragment of divinity. Therefore I cannot be harmed by any of them, as none will infect me with their wrong. Nor can I be angry with my kinsman or hate him. We were born for cooperation, like feet, like hands, like eyelids, like the rows of upper and lower teeth. So to work in opposition to one another is against nature: and anger or rejection is opposition.","Live every day as if thy last.","Your mind will be like its habitual thoughts; for the soul becomes dyed with the color of its thoughts.","I do not regard a man as poor, if the little which remains is enough for him.","Remember how long you\u2019ve been putting this off, how many extensions the gods gave you, and you didn\u2019t use them. At some point you have to recognize what world it is that you belong to; what power rules it and from what source you spring; that there is a limit to the time assigned you, and if you don\u2019t use it to free yourself it will be gone and will never return.","III. I have often wondered how it should come to pass, that every man loving himself best, should more regard other men\'s opinions concerning himself than his own. For if any God or grave master standing by, should command any of us to think nothing by himself but what he should presently speak out; no man were able to endure it, though but for one day. Thus do we fear more what our neighbours will think of us, than what we ourselves.","The best revenge is not to be like that.","Constantly regard the universe as one living being, having one substance and one soul; and observe how all things have reference to one perception, the perception of this one living being; and how all things act with one movement; and how all things are the cooperating causes of all things that exist; observe, too, the continuous spinning of the thread and the contexture of the web.","The pride which is proud of want of pride is the most intolerable of all.","32. You have to assemble your life yourself\u2014action by action. And be satisfied if each one achieves its goal, as far as it can. No one can keep that from happening. \u2014But there are external obstacles.\u2026 Not to behaving with justice, self-control, and good sense. \u2014Well, but perhaps to some more concrete action. But if you accept the obstacle and work with what you\u2019re given, an alternative will present itself\u2014another piece of what you\u2019re trying to assemble. Action by action.","There\u2019s nothing more insufferable than people who boast about their own humility","All of us are working on the same project. Some consciously, with understanding; some without knowing it. (I think this is what Heraclitus meant when he said that \u201cthose who sleep are also hard at work\u2014that they too collaborate in what happens.) Some of us work in one way, and some in others. And those who complain and try to obstruct and thwart things\u2014they help as much as anyone. The world needs them as well. So make up your mind who you\u2019ll choose to work with. The force that directs all things will make good use of you regardless\u2014will put you on its payroll and set you to work. But make sure it\u2019s not the job Chrysippus speaks of: the bad line in the play, put there for laughs.\u201d","It is not death that a man should fear, but rather he should fear never beginning to live.","\u0627\u0644\u0633\u0639\u064a \u0641\u064a \u062d\u062f \u0630\u0627\u062a\u0647 \u0625\u0644\u0649 \u0627\u0644\u0641\u0636\u064a\u0644\u0629 \u0641\u0636\u064a\u0644\u0629","Keep this constantly in mind: that all sorts of people have died\u2014all professions, all nationalities.

Eudoxus, Hipparchus, Archimedes . . . . . . the smart, the generous, the hardworking, the cunning, the selfish . . . . . . and even Menippus and his cohorts, who laughed at thewhole brief, fragile business. All underground for a long time now. And what harm does it do them? Or the others either\u2014the ones whose names we don\u2019t even know? The only thing that isn\u2019t worthless: to live this life out truthfully and rightly. And be patient with those who don\u2019t.","Not to live as if you had endless years ahead of you. Death overshadows you. While you\u2019re alive and able\u2014be good. 18.","Death is a cessation from the impression of the senses, the tyranny of the passions, the errors of the mind, and the servitude of the body.","At dawn, when you have trouble getting out of bed, tell yourself: \u201cI have to go to work\u2014as a human being. What do I have to complain of, if I\u2019m going to do what I was born for\u2014the things I was brought into the world to do? Or is this what I was created for? To huddle under the blankets and stay warm?","Accustom yourself to Master tilings of the greatest difficulty, and which you seem to despair of. For if you observe, the Left-hand, tho\' for want of Practice, \'tis insignificant to other Business, yet it holds the Bridle better than the Right, because it has been used to it.","To grieve or be angry about or fear what happens to you is to be a fugitive from the law of nature.","Practice really hearing what people say. Do your best to get inside their minds.","In no great while you will be no one and nowhere, and nothing that you now behold will be in existence, nor will anyone now alive. For it is in the nature of all things to change and alter and perish, so that others may arise in their turn.","Don\u2019t be ashamed to need help. Like a soldier storming a wall, you have a mission to accomplish. And if you\u2019ve been wounded and you need a comrade to pull you up? So what?","From my governor, to be neither of the green nor of the blue party at the games in the Circus, nor a partisan either of the Parmularius or the Scutarius at the gladiators\' fights; from him too I learned endurance of labor, and to want little, and to work with my own hands, and not to meddle with other people\'s affairs, and not to be ready to listen to slander.","No thefts of free will reported.[\u2014Epictetus.]\u201d","We should remember that even Nature\'s inadvertence has its own charm, its own attractiveness.

But not everyone could have remained unharmed by it. Why treat the one as a misfortune rather than the other as fortunate? Can you really call something a misfortune that doesn\u2019t violate human nature? Or do you think something that\u2019s not against nature\u2019s will can violate it? But you know what its will is. Does what\u2019s happened keep you from acting with justice, generosity, self-control, sanity, prudence, honesty, humility, straightforwardness, and all the other qualities that allow a person\u2019s nature to fulfill itself?

They\u2019re like a vine that produces grapes without looking for anything in return. A horse at the end of the race . . . A dog when the hunt is over . . . A bee with its honey stored . . . And a human being after helping others. They don\u2019t make a fuss about it. They just go on to something else, as the vine looks forward to bearing fruit again in season. We should be like that. Acting almost unconsciously. \u2014Yes. Except conscious of it. Because it\u2019s characteristic of social beings that they see themselves as acting socially. And expect their neighbors to see it too! That\u2019s true. But you\u2019re misunderstanding me. You\u2019ll wind up like the people I mentioned before, misled by plausible reasoning. But if you make an effort to understand what I\u2019m saying, then you won\u2019t need to worry about neglecting your social duty.","Don\u2019t waste the rest of your time here worrying about other people\u2014unless it affects the common good. It will keep you from doing anything useful. You\u2019ll be too preoccupied with what so-and-so is doing, and why, and what they\u2019re saying, and what they\u2019re thinking, and what they\u2019re up to, and all the other things that throw you off and keep you from focusing on your own mind. You need to avoid certain things in your train of thought: everything random, everything irrelevant. And certainly everything self-important or malicious. You need to get used to winnowing your thoughts, so that if someone says, \u201cWhat are you thinking about? you can respond at once (and truthfully) that you are thinking this or thinking that. And it would be obvious at once from your answer that your thoughts were straightforward and considerate ones\u2014the thoughts of an unselfish person, one unconcerned with pleasure and with sensual indulgence generally, with squabbling, with slander and envy, or anything else you\u2019d be ashamed to be caught thinking. Someone like that\u2014someone who refuses to put off joining the elect\u2014is a kind of priest, a servant of the gods, in touch with what is within him and what keeps a person undefiled by pleasures, invulnerable to any pain, untouched by arrogance, unaffected by meanness, an athlete in the greatest of all contests\u2014the struggle not to be overwhelmed by anything that happens. With what leaves us dyed indelibly by justice, welcoming wholeheartedly whatever comes\u2014whatever we\u2019re assigned\u2014not worrying too often, or with any selfish motive, about what other people say. Or do, or think. He does only what is his to do, and considers constantly what the world has in store for him\u2014doing his best, and trusting that all is for the best. For we carry our fate with us\u2014and it carries us. He keeps in mind that all rational things are related, and that to care for all human beings is part of being human. Which doesn\u2019t mean we have to share their opinions. We should listen only to those whose lives conform to nature. And the others? He bears in mind what sort of people they are\u2014both at home and abroad, by night as well as day\u2014and who they spend their time with. And he cares nothing for their praise\u2014men who can\u2019t even meet their own standards.\u201d","Not the \u201cnot but the \u201cnot yet.\u201d","Does a man offend your pride? Remember he will be dead soon, as will you.","Like seeing roasted meat and other dishes in front of you and suddenly realizing: This is a dead fish. A dead bird. A dead pig. Or that this noble vintage is grape juice, and the purple robes are sheep wool dyed with shellfish blood. Or making love\u2014something rubbing against your penis, a brief seizure and a little cloudy liquid. Perceptions like that\u2014latching onto things and piercing through them, so we see what they really are. That\u2019s what we need to do all the time\u2014all through our lives when things lay claim to our trust\u2014to lay them bare and see how pointless they are, to strip away the legend that encrusts them. Pride is a master of deception: when you think you\u2019re occupied in the weightiest business, that\u2019s when he has you in his spell.","To feel affection for people even when they make mistakes is uniquely human. You can do it, if you simply recognize: that they\u2019re human too, that they act out of ignorance, against their will, and that you\u2019ll both be dead before long. And, above all, that they haven\u2019t really hurt you. They haven\u2019t diminished your ability to choose.","A healthy pair of eyes should see everything that can beseen and not say, \u201cNo!

But all this is quite unphilosophic, when it is open to you, at any time you want, to retreat into yourself. No retreat offers someone more quiet and relaxation than that into his own mind, especially if he can dip into thoughts there which put him at immediate and complete ease: and by ease I simply mean a well-ordered life. So constantly give yourself this retreat, and renew yourself. The doctrines you will visit there should be few and fundamental, sufficient at one meeting to wash away all your pain and send you back free of resentment at what you must rejoin.","You\u2019ve given aid and they\u2019ve received it. And yet, like an idiot, you keep holding out for more: to be credited with a Good Deed, to be repaid in kind. Why?","I am composed of the formal and the material; and neither of them will perish into non-existence, as neither of them came into existence out of non-existence. Every part of me then will be reduced by change into some part of the universe, and that again will change into another part of the universe, and so on for ever.","Bear in mind that everything that exists is already fraying at the edges, and in transition, subject to fragmentation and to rot.

Is this the right thing to do?) < . . . > not to be distracted by their darkness. To run straight for the finish line, unswerving.","Beautiful things of any kind are beautiful in themselves and sufficient to themselves. Praise is extraneous. The object of praise remains what it was\u2014no better and no worse. This applies, I think, even to \u201cbeautiful things in ordinary life\u2014physical objects, artworks. Does anything genuinely beautiful need supplementing? No more than justice does\u2014or truth, or kindness, or humility. Are any of those improved by being praised? Or damaged by contempt? Is an emerald suddenly flawed if no one admires it? Or gold, or ivory, or purple? Lyres? Knives? Flowers? Bushes?\u201d","Stop whatever you\u2019re doing for a moment and ask yourself: Am I afraid of death because I won\u2019t be able to do this anymore?","Pride is a master of deception: when you think you\u2019re occupied in the weightiest business, that\u2019s when he has you in his spell.","\u2014Then where is harm to be found?

They seek for themselves private retiring places, as country villages, the sea-shore, mountains; yea thou thyself art wont to long much after such places. But all this thou must know proceeds from simplicity in the highest degree. At what time soever thou wilt, it is in thy power to retire into thyself, and to be at rest, and free from all businesses. A man cannot any whither retire better than to his own soul; he especially who is beforehand provided of such things within, which whensoever he doth withdraw himself to look in, may presently afford unto him perfect ease and tranquillity. By tranquillity I understand a decent orderly disposition and carriage, free from all confusion and tumultuousness. Afford then thyself this retiring continually, and thereby refresh and renew thyself. Let these precepts be brief and fundamental, which as soon as thou dost call them to mind, may suffice thee to purge thy soul throughly, and to send thee away well pleased with those things whatsoever they be, which now again after this short withdrawing of thy soul into herself thou dost return unto. For what is it that thou art offended at? Can it be at the wickedness of men, when thou dost call to mind this conclusion, that all reasonable creatures are made one for another? and that it is part of justice to bear with them? and that it is against their wills that they offend? and how many already, who once likewise prosecuted their enmities, suspected, hated, and fiercely contended, are now long ago stretched out, and reduced unto ashes? It is time for thee to make an end. As for those things which among the common chances of the world happen unto thee as thy particular lot and portion, canst thou be displeased with any of them, when thou dost call that our ordinary dilemma to mind, either a providence, or Democritus his atoms; and with it, whatsoever we brought to prove that the whole world is as it were one city? And as for thy body, what canst thou fear, if thou dost consider that thy mind and understanding, when once it hath recollected itself, and knows its own power, hath in this life and breath (whether it run smoothly and gently, or whether harshly and rudely), no interest at all, but is altogether indifferent: and whatsoever else thou hast heard and assented unto concerning either pain or pleasure? But the care of thine honour and reputation will perchance distract thee? How can that be, if thou dost look back, and consider both how quickly all things that are, are forgotten, and what an immense chaos of eternity was before, and will follow after all things: and the vanity of praise, and the inconstancy and variableness of human judgments and opinions, and the narrowness of the place, wherein it is limited and circumscribed? For the whole earth is but as one point; and of it, this inhabited part of it, is but a very little part; and of this part, how many in number, and what manner of men are they, that will commend thee? What remains then, but that thou often put in practice this kind of retiring of thyself, to this little part of thyself; and above all things, keep thyself from distraction, and intend not anything vehemently, but be free and consider all things, as a man whose proper object is Virtue, as a man whose true nature is to be kind and sociable, as a citizen, as a mortal creature. Among other things, which to consider, and look into thou must use to withdraw thyself, let those two be among the most obvious and at hand. One, that the things or objects themselves reach not unto the soul, but stand without still and quiet, and that it is from the opinion only which is within, that all the tumult and all the trouble doth proceed. The next, that all these things, which now thou seest, shall within a very little while be changed, and be no more: and ever call to mind, how many changes and alterations in the world thou thyself hast already been an eyewitness of in thy time. This world is mere change, and this life, opinion.","The thing itself was no misfortune at all; to endure it and prevail is great good fortune.","Time is like a river made up of the events which hap\xadpen, and a vi\xadol\xadent stream; for as soon as a thing has been seen, it is car\xadried away, and an\xadother comes in its place, and this will be car\xadried away too.","Remember how long you have procrastinated, and how consistently you have failed to put to good use you suspended sentence from the gods. It is about time you realized the nature of the universe (of which you are part) and of the pwoer that rules it (to which your art owes its existence). Your days are numbered. Use them to throw open the windows of your soul to the sun. If you do not, the sun will soon set, and you with it. (II.4)","BEGIN the morning by saying to thyself, I shall meet with the busy-body, the ungrateful, arrogant, deceitful, envious, unsocial.","I learned endurance of labour, and to want little, and to work with my own hands, and not to meddle with other people\'s affairs, and not to be ready to listen to slander.","When you need encouragement, think of the qualities the people around you have: this one\u2019s energy, that one\u2019s modesty, another\u2019s generosity, and so on. Nothing is as encouraging as when virtues are visibly embodied in the people around us, when we\u2019re practically showered with them. It\u2019s good to keep this in mind.","When Theophrastus is comparing sins \u2013 so far as they are commonly acknowledged to be comparable \u2013 he affirms the philosophic truth that sins of desire are more culpable than sins of passion. For passion\u2019s revulsion from reason at least seems to bring with it a certain discomfort, and a half-felt sense of constraint; whereas sins of desire, in which pleasure predominates, indicate a more self-indulgent and womanish disposition. Both experience and philosophy, then, support the contention that a sin which is pleasurable deserves graver censure than one which is painful. In the one case the offender is like a man stung into an involuntary loss of control by some injustice; in the other, eagerness to gratify his desire moves him to do wrong of his own volition.","Whatever may happen to you, it was prepared for you from all eternity; and the implication of causes was from eternity spinning the thread of your being, and of that which is incident to it.","All that exists is the seed of what will emerge from it.","Is an emerald suddenly flawed if no one admires it?","Do not waste the remainder of thy life in thoughts about others, when thou dost not refer thy thoughts to some object of common utility.","\u2022\\tWhatever anyone does or says, I must be good; just as if the emerald were always saying this: \\"Whatever anyone does or says, I must still be emerald, and keep my color.","The goal that you hope you will one day arrive at after a long and roundabout journey you are able to possess right now, if only you do not deny it to yourself. That is, if you can let go of the past, entrust the future to Providence and redirect the present according to justice and the sacred. To the sacred, so that you welcome what has been given to you, for Nature has brought this to you, and you to it; and to justice, in order that you may speak the truth freely and without distortion, and that you may act in accordance with what is lawful and right. Do not allow yourself to be hindered by the harmful actions, judgments, or the words of another, or by the sensations of the flesh which has formed itself around you. Let the body take care of those. But if, when you have come to the end, having let go of all other things, you honor only your guiding part and the divinity that is within you, and you do not fear ceasing to live so much as you fear never having begun to live in accordance with Nature--then you will be a man who is worth of the Cosmos that created you; and you will cease to live like a stranger in your own land, that is, surprised at unexpected everyday occurrences and wholly distracted by this and that.","Our actions may be impeded by them, but there can be no impeding our intentions or our dispositions. Because we can accommodate and adapt. The mind adapts and converts to its own purposes the obstacle to our acting.","Surely it is an excellent plan, when you are seated before delicacies and choice foods, to impress upon your imagination that this is the dead body of a fish, that the dead body of a bird or a pig; and again, that the Falernian wine is grape juice and that robe of purple a lamb\'s fleece dipped in a shellfish\'s blood; and in matters of sex intercourse, that it is the attrition of an entrail and a convulsive expulsion of a mere mucus. Surely these are excellent imaginations, going to the heart of actual facts and penetrating them so as to see the kind of things they really are. You should adopt this practice all through your life, and where things make an impression which is very plausible, uncover their nakedness, see into their cheapness, strip off the profession on which they vaunt themselves. For pride is an arch-seducer of reason, and just when you fancy you are most certainly busy in good works, then you are mostly certainly guilty of imposture.","Since it is possible that thou mayest depart from life this very moment, regulate every act and thought accordingly.","The time of a man\'s life is as a point; the substance of it ever flowing, the sense obscure; and the whole composition of the body tending to corruption. His soul is restless, fortune uncertain, and fame doubtful; to be brief, as a stream so are all things belonging to the body; as a dream, or as a smoke, so are all that belong unto the soul. Our life is a warfare, and a mere pilgrimage. Fame after life is no better than oblivion. What is it then that will adhere and follow? Only one thing, philosophy. And philosophy doth consist in this, for a man to preserve that spirit which is within him, from all manner of contumelies and injuries, and above all pains or pleasures; never to do anything either rashly, or feignedly, or hypocritically: wholly to depend from himself and his own proper actions: all things that happen unto him to embrace contentedly, as coming from Him from whom he himself also came; and above all things, with all meekness and a calm cheerfulness, to expect death, as being nothing else but the resolution of those elements, of which every creature is composed.","Let no act be done without a purpose, nor otherwise than according to the perfect principles of art.","Y recuerda que has de tratarles como a hombres, porque son tan humanos como t\xfa y por tanto te resultan tan imprescindibles como la mand\xedbula inferior lo es para la superior.","Nothing that goes on in anyone else\u2019s mind can harm you. Nor can the shifts and changes in the world around you. \u2014Then where is harm to be found? In your capacity to see it. Stop doing that and everything will be fine. Let the part of you that makes that judgment keep quiet even if the body it\u2019s attached to is stabbed or burnt, or stinking with pus, or consumed by cancer. Or to put it another way: It needs to realize that what happens to everyone\u2014bad and good alike\u2014is neither good nor bad.","We speak of the sun\u2019s light as \u201cpouring down on us, as \u201cpouring over us\u201d in all directions. Yet it\u2019s never poured out. Because it doesn\u2019t really pour; it extends. Its beams (aktai) get their name from their extension (ekteinesthai). To see the nature of a sunbeam, look at light as it falls through a narrow opening into a dark room. It extends in a straight line, striking any solid object that stands in its way and blocks the space beyond it. There it remains\u2014not vanishing, or falling away. That\u2019s what the outpouring\u2014the diffusion\u2014of thought should be like: not emptied out, but extended. And not striking at obstacles with fury and violence, or falling away before them, but holding its ground and illuminating what receives it. What doesn\u2019t transmit light creates its own darkness.\u201d","As a horse when he has run, a dog when he has tracked the game, a bee when it has made the honey, so a man when he has done a good act, does not call out for others to come and see, but he goes on to another act, as a vine goes on to produce again the grapes in season.","No lo hagas, si no conviene; no lo digas si no es verdad.","In the morning, when you rise unwillingly, let this thought be present: I am rising to the work of a human being. Why then am I dissatisfied if I am going to do the things for which I exist and for which I was brought into the world? Or have I been made for this, to lie under the blankets and keep myself warm? But this is more pleasant. Do you exist then to take your pleasure, and not at all for action or exertion?","Why all this guesswork? You can see what needs to bedone. If you can see the road, follow it.","These things thou must always have in mind: What is the nature of the universe, and what is mine\u2014in particular: This unto that what relation it hath: what kind of part, of what kind of universe it is: And that there is nobody that can hinder thee, but that thou mayest always both do and speak those things which are agreeable to that nature, whereof thou art a part.","For it is according to nature, and nothing is evil which is according to nature.","But death certainly, and life, honour and dishonour, pain and pleasure, all these things equally happen to good men and bad, being things which make us neither better nor worse. Therefore they are neither good nor evil.","Consider how quickly all things are dissolved and resolved:","Maximus was my model for self-control, fixity of purpose, and cheerfulness under ill-health or other misfortunes. His character was an admirable combination of dignity and charm, and all the duties of his station were performed quietly and without fuss. He gave everyone the conviction that he spoke as he believed, and acted as he judged right. Bewilderment or timidity were unknown to him; he was never hasty, never dilatory; nothing found him at a loss. He indulged neither in despondency nor forced gaiety, nor had anger or jealousy any power over him. Kindliness, sympathy, and sincerity all contributed to give the impression of a rectitude that was innate rather than inculcated. Nobody was ever made by him to feel inferior, yet none could have presumed to challenge his pre-eminence. He was also the possessor of an agreeable sense of humour.","Spend not the remnant of thy days in thoughts and fancies concerning other men, when it is not in relation to some common good, when by it thou art hindered from some other better work.","Forget everything else. Keep hold of this alone and remember it: Each of us lives only now, this brief instant. The rest has been lived already, or is impossible to see. The span we live is small\u2014small","Do your best to convince them. But act on your own, if justice requires it. If met with force, then fall back on acceptance and peaceability. Use the setback to practice other virtues. Remember that our efforts are subject to circumstances; you weren\u2019t aiming to do the impossible. \u2014Aiming to do what, then? To try. And you succeeded. What you set out to do is accomplished.","All men die, but that not all men die whining","\u0645\u062d\u0638\u0648\u0638 \u0630\u0644\u0643 \u0627\u0644\u0630\u064a \u0644\u0627\u064a\u062e\u0627\u0641 \u0648\u0644\u0627 \u064a\u0623\u0645\u0644 - \u0632\u064a\u0646\u0648\u0646","\u0644\u0627 \u0623\u062e\u0627\u0641 \u0634\u064a\u0626\u0627 \u0648\u0644\u0627 \u0622\u0645\u0644 \u0641\u064a \u0634\u0626 \u0625\u0646\u064a \u062d\u0631 - \u0643\u0627\u0632\u0646\u062a\u0632\u0627\u0643\u064a\u0633","To do harm is to do yourself harm. To do an injustice is to do yourself an injustice\u2014it degrades you.","Now it is true that these may impede my action, but they are no impediments to my affects and disposition, which have the power of acting conditionally and changing: for the mind converts and changes every hindrance to its activity into an aid; and so that which is a hindrance is made a furtherance to an act; and an obstacle on the road helps us along this road.","To feel affection for people even when they makemistakes is uniquely human. You can do it, if you simplyrecognize: that they\u2019re human too, that they act out ofignorance, against their will, and that you\u2019ll both be deadbefore long. And, above all, that they haven\u2019t really hurt you.They haven\u2019t diminished your ability to choose.","Failure to observe what is in the mind of another has seldom made a man unhappy; but those who do not observe the movements of their own minds must of necessity be unhappy.","No malgastes lo que te queda de vida en conjeturar sobre los dem\xe1s, a no ser que busques el bien com\xfan; pues si te dedicas a imaginar qu\xe9 hace la gente, por qu\xe9, qu\xe9 dice, que piensa, qu\xe9 trama, y cosas parecidas, dejar\xe1s de observar tu propia conciencia interior.","And here are two of the most immediately useful thoughts you will dip into. First that things cannot touch the mind: they are external and inert; anxieties can only come from your internal judgement. Second, hat all these things you see will change almost as you look at them, and then will be no more. Constantly bring to mind all that you yourself have already seen changed. The universe is change: life is judgement.","Other people\u2019s mistakes? Leave them to their makers.","A man without ever the least appearance of anger, or any other passion; able at the same time most exactly to observe the Stoic Apathia, or unpassionateness, and yet to be most tender-hearted: ever of good credit; and yet almost without any noise, or rumour: very learned, and yet making little show.","27. Treat what you don\u2019t have as nonexistent. Look at what you have, the things you value most, and think of how much you\u2019d crave them if you didn\u2019t have them. But be careful. Don\u2019t feel such satisfaction that you start to overvalue them\u2014that it would upset you to lose them.","It is a shame when the soul is first to give way in this life, and the body does not give way.","We live only in the present, in this fleet-footed moment. The rest is lost and behind us, or ahead of us and may never be found. Little of life we know, little the plot of earth on which we dwell, little the memory of even the most famous who have lived, and this memory itself is preserved by generations of little men, who know little about themselves and far less about those who died long ago.","Go on abusing yourself, O my soul! Not long and you will lose the opportunity to show yourself any respect. We have only one life to live, and yours is almost over. Because you have chosen not to respect yourself, you have made your happiness subject to the opinions others have of you. (Book 2, Verse 6)","Let nothing be done rashly, and at random, but all things according to the most exact and perfect rules of art.","Most of what we say and do is not necessary, and its omission would save both time and trouble. At every step, therefore, a man should ask himself, \'Is this one of the things that are superfluous?\' Moreover, not idle actions only but even idle impressions ought to be suppressed; for the unnecessary action will not ensue.","The way to peace is to be content with yourself, honor the light of reason within, live in harmony with others, and be grateful to the gods for the universe and your role in it.","\u03a4\u03bf\u1fe6\u03c4\u03bf \u1f14\u03c7\u03b5\u03b9 \u1f21 \u03c4\u03b5\u03bb\u03b5\u03b9\u03cc\u03c4\u03b7\u03c2 \u03c4\u03bf\u1fe6 \u1f24\u03b8\u03bf\u03c5\u03c2, \u03c4\u1f78 \u03c0\u1fb6\u03c3\u03b1\u03bd \u1f21\u03bc\u03ad\u03c1\u03b1\u03bd \u1f61\u03c2 \u03c4\u03b5\u03bb\u03b5\u03c5\u03c4\u03b1\u03af\u03b1\u03bd \u03b4\u03b9\u03b5\u03be\u03ac\u03b3\u03b5\u03b9\u03bd \u03ba\u03b1\u1f76 \u03bc\u03ae\u03c4\u03b5 \u03c3\u03c6\u03cd\u03b6\u03b5\u03b9\u03bd \u03bc\u03ae\u03c4\u03b5 \u03bd\u03b1\u03c1\u03ba\u1fb6\u03bd \u03bc\u03ae\u03c4\u03b5 \u1f51\u03c0\u03bf\u03ba\u03c1\u03af\u03bd\u03b5\u03c3\u03b8\u03b1\u03b9. http://el.wikisource.org/wiki/\u03a4\u03b1_\u03b5\u03b9\u03c2_...","Souviens toi que chacun ne vit que dans le moment pr\xe9sent, dans l\'instant. Le reste, c\'est le pass\xe9 ou un obscur avenir. Petite est donc l\'\xe9tendue de la vie.","When you wake up in the morning, tell yourself: The people I deal with today will be meddling, ungrateful, arrogant, dishonest, jealous, and surly. They are like this because they can\u2019t tell good from evil. But I have seen the beauty of good, and the ugliness of evil, and have recognized that the wrongdoer has a nature related to my own\u2014not of the same blood or birth, but the same mind, and possessing a share of the divine.","No longer wander at hazard; for neither wilt thou read thy own memoirs, nor the acts of the ancient Romans and Hellenes, and the selections from books which thou wast reserving for thy old age. Hasten then to the end which thou hast before thee, and throwing away idle hopes, come to thy own aid, if thou carest at all for thyself, while it is in thy power.","Even if you were destined to live three thousand years, or ten times that long, nevertheless remember that no one loses any life other than the one he lives, or lives any life other than the life he loses. It follows that the longest and the shortest lives are brought to the same state. The present moment is equal for all; so what is passing is equal also; the loss therefore turns out to be the merest fragment of time. No one can lose either the past or the future -- how could anyone be deprived of what he does not possess?So always remember these two things. First, that all things have been of the same kind from everlasting, coming round and round again, and it makes no difference whether one will see the same things for a hundred years, or two hundred years, or for an infinity of time. Second, that both the longest-lived and the earliest to die suffer the same loss. It is only the present moment of which either stands to be deprived: and if indeed this is all he has, he cannot lose what he does not have.","hold every hour in your grasp. Lay hold of to-day\'s task, and you will not need to depend so much upon to-morrow\'s. While we are postponing, life speeds by. Nothing, Lucilius, is ours, except time. We were entrusted by nature with the ownership of this single thing, so fleeting and slippery that anyone who will can oust us from possession.","Let it happen, if it wants, to whatever it can happen to. And what\u2019s affected can complain about it if it wants. It doesn\u2019t hurt me unless I interpret its happening as harmful to me. I can choose not to.","Always remember what Heraclitus said: \'The death of earth is the birth of water, the death of water is the birth of atmosphere, the death of atmosphere is fire, and conversely.\' Remember, too, his image of the man who forgets the way he is going; and: \'They are at variance with that with which they most continuously have converse (Reason which governs the Universe), and the things they meet with every day appear alien to them\'; and again: \'We suppose that we act and speak\'; and: \'We must not be like children with parents,\' that is, accept things simply as we have received them.","External things are not the problem. It\u2019s your assessment of them. Which you can erase right now. If the problem is something in your own character, who\u2019s stopping you from setting your mind straight? And if it\u2019s that you\u2019re not doing something you think you should be, why not just do it? \u2014But there are insuperable obstacles. Then it\u2019s not a problem. The cause of your inaction lies outside you. \u2014But how can I go on living with that undone? Then depart, with a good conscience, as if you\u2019d done it, embracing the obstacles too.","You\u2019ve lived as a citizen in a great city. Five years or a hundred\u2014what\u2019s the difference? The laws make no distinction.And to be sent away from it, not by a tyrant or a dishonest judge, but by Nature, who first invited you in\u2014why is that so terrible?Like the impresario ringing down the curtain on an actor:\u201cBut I\u2019ve only gotten through three acts . . . !Yes. This will be a drama in three acts, the length fixed by the power that directed your creation, and now directs your dissolution. Neither was yours to determine.So make your exit with grace\u2014the same grace shown to you.\u201d","Be not querulous, be Content with little, be kind, be free; avoid all superfluity, all vain prattling; be magnanimous.","It stares you in the face. No role is so well suited to philosophy as the one you happen to be in right now.","But death and life, honor and dishonor, pain and pleasure\u2014all these things equally happen to good men and bad, being things which make us neither better nor worse. Therefore they are neither good nor evil.","Even if you\u2019re going to live three thousand more years, or ten times that, remember: you cannot lose another life than the one you\u2019re living now, or live another one than the one you\u2019re losing. The longest amounts to the same as the shortest. The present is the same for everyone; its loss is the same for everyone; and it should be clear that a brief instant is all that is lost. For you can\u2019t lose either the past or the future; how could you lose what you don\u2019t have? Remember two things: i. that everything has always been the same, and keeps recurring, and it makes no difference whether you see the same things recur in a hundred years or two hundred, or in an infinite period; ii. that the longest-lived and those who will die soonest lose the same thing. The present is all that they can give up, since that is all you have, and what you do not have, you cannot lose.","Well, then, shall mere glory distract you? Look at the swiftness of the oblivion of all men; the gulf of endless time, behind and before; the hollowness of applause, the fickleness and folly of those who seem to speak well of you, and the narrow room in which it is confined. This should make you pause. For the entire earth is a point in space, and how small a corner thereof is this your dwelling place, and how few and how paltry those who will sing your praises here!","When you run up against someone else\u2019s shamelessness, ask yourself this: Is a world without shamelessness possible? No. Then don\u2019t ask the impossible. There have to be shameless people in the world. This is one of them. The same for someone vicious or untrustworthy, or with any other defect. Remembering that the whole class has to exist will make you more tolerant of its members. Another useful point to bear in mind: What qualities has nature given us to counter that defect? As an antidote to unkindness it gave us kindness. And other qualities to balance other flaws. And when others stray off course, you can always try to set them straight, because every wrongdoer is doing something wrong\u2014doing something the wrong way. And how does it injure you anyway? You\u2019ll find that none of the people you\u2019re upset about has done anything that could do damage to your mind. But that\u2019s all that \u201charm or \u201cinjury\u201d could mean. Yes, boorish people do boorish things. What\u2019s strange or unheard-of about that? Isn\u2019t it yourself you should reproach\u2014for not anticipating that they\u2019d act this way? The logos gave you the means to see it\u2014that a given person would act a given way\u2014but you paid no attention. And now you\u2019re astonished that he\u2019s gone and done it. So when you call someone \u201cuntrustworthy\u201d or \u201cungrateful,\u201d turn the reproach on yourself. It was you who did wrong. By assuming that someone with those traits deserved your trust. Or by doing them a favor and expecting something in return, instead of looking to the action itself for your reward. What else did you expect from helping someone out? Isn\u2019t it enough that you\u2019ve done what your nature demands? You want a salary for it too? As if your eyes expected a reward for seeing, or your feet for walking. That\u2019s what they were made for. By doing what they were designed to do, they\u2019re performing their function. Whereas humans were made to help others. And when we do help others\u2014or help them to do something\u2014we\u2019re doing what we were designed for. We perform our function.\u201d","Don\u2019t let your imagination be crushed by life as a whole. Don\u2019t try to picture everything bad that could possibly happen. Stick with the situation at hand, and ask, \u201cWhy is this so unbearable? Why can\u2019t I endure it? You\u2019ll be embarrassed to answer. Then remind yourself that past and future have no power over you. Only the present\u2014and even that can be minimized. Just mark off its limits. And if your mind tries to claim that it can\u2019t hold out against that\xa0\u2026\xa0well, then, heap shame upon it.\u201d","Either the gods have no power or they have power. If, then, they have no power, why do you pray to them? But if they have power, why do you not pray for them to give you the faculty of not fearing any of the things that you fear, or of not desiring any of the things that you desire, or not being pained at anything, rather than pray that they should grant this or refuse that? For certainly if they can cooperate with men, they can cooperate for these purposes. But perhaps you will say, the gods have placed this in your power. Well, then, is it not better to use what is in your power like a free man than to desire in a slavish and abject way what is not in your power? And who has told you that the gods do not aid us even in the things that are in our power?","Nowhere can man find a quieter or more untroubled retreat than in his own soul","When you wake up in the morning, tell yourself: The people I deal with today will be meddling, ungrateful, arrogant, dishonest, jealous, and surly. They are like this because they can\u2019t tell good from evil. But I have seen the beauty of good, and the ugliness of evil, and have recognized that the wrongdoer has a nature related to my own\u2014not of the same blood or birth, but the same mind, and possessing a share of the divine. And so none of them can hurt me. No one can implicate me in ugliness. Nor can I feel angry at my relative, or hate him. We were born to work together like feet, hands, and eyes, like the two rows of teeth, upper and lower. To obstruct each other is unnatural. To feel anger at someone, to turn your back on him: these are obstructions.","That you don\u2019t know for sure it is a mistake. A lot of things are means to some other end. You have to know an awful lot before you can judge other people\u2019s actions with real understanding.","The mind is the ruler of the soul. It should remain unstirred by agitations of the flesh\u2014gentle and violent onesalike. Not mingling with them, but fencing itself off and keeping those feelings in their place. When they make their way into your thoughts, through the sympathetic link between mind and body, don\u2019t try to resist the sensation. The sensation is natural. But don\u2019t let the mind start in withjudgments, calling it \u201cgood or \u201cbad.\u201d","That kindness is invincible, provided it\u2019s sincere\u2014not ironic or an act. What can even the most vicious person do if you keep treating him with kindness and gently set him straight\u2014if you get the chance\u2014correcting him cheerfully at the exact moment that he\u2019s trying to do you harm. \u201cNo, no, my friend. That isn\u2019t what we\u2019re here for. It isn\u2019t me who\u2019s harmed by that. It\u2019s you. And show him, gently and without pointing fingers, that it\u2019s so. That bees don\u2019t behave like this\u2014or any other animals with a sense of community. Don\u2019t do it sardonically or meanly, but affectionately\u2014with no hatred in your heart.

Absorbed in an instant into eternity. The fraction of all substance, and all spirit. The fraction of the whole earth you crawl about on. Keep all that in mind, and don\u2019t treat anything as important except doing what your nature demands, and accepting what Nature sends you.","The soul of man is thus an emanation from the godhead,into whom it will eventually be re-absorbed. The divine ruling principle makesall things work together for good, but for the good of the whole. The highest good ofman is consciously to work with God for the common good, and this is the sense inwhich the Stoic tried to live in accord with nature. In the individual it is virtue alonewhich enables him to do this; as Providence rules the universe, so virtue in the soulmust rule man.","in the ways of Nature there is no evil to be found.","Suppose that a god announced that you were going to die tomorrow \u201cor the day after.

Praising its mother, thanking the tree it grew on.","Frightened of change? But what can exist without it? What\u2019s closer to nature\u2019s heart? Can you take a hot bath and leave the firewood as it was? Eat food without transforming it? Can any vital process take place without something being changed? Can\u2019t you see? It\u2019s just the same with you\u2014and just as vital to nature.","The chief obstacle is that we are quick to be satisfied with ourselves. If we find someone to call us good men, cautious and principled, we acknowledge him. We are not content with a moderate eulogy, but accept as our due whatever flattery has shamelessly heaped upon us. We agree with those who call us best and wisest, although we know they often utter many falsehoods: we indulge ourselves so greatly that we want to be praised for a virtue which is the opposite of our behavior. A man hears himself called \u2018most merciful\u2019 while he is inflicting torture.. So it follows that we don\u2019t want to change because we believe we are already excellent.","Put from you the belief that I have been wronged and with it will go the feeling. Reject your sense of injury, and the injury itself disappears.","I do my duty: other things trouble me not; for they are either things without life, or things without reason, or things that have rambled and know not the way.","You have a mind? \u2014Yes. Well, why not use it? Isn\u2019t that all you want\u2014for it to do its job?","A better wrestler.

He that is unjust, hurts himself, in that he makes himself worse than he was before. Not he only that committeth, but he also that omitteth something, is oftentimes unjust.","A trite but effective tactic against the fear of death: think of the list of people who had to be pried away from life. What did they gain by dying old? In the end, they all sleep six feet under\u2014Caedicianus, Fabius, Julian, Lepidus, and all the rest. They buried their contemporaries, and were buried in turn. Our lifetime is so brief. And to live it out in these circumstances, among these people, in this body? Nothing to get excited about. Consider the abyss of time past, the infinite future. Three days of life or three generations: what\u2019s the difference?","The universe is transformation; life is opinion.","A key point to bear in mind: The value of attentiveness varies in proportion to its object. You\u2019re better off not giving the small things more time than they deserve.","At dawn, when you have trouble getting out of bed, tell yourself: \u201cI have to go to work\u2014as a human being. What do I have to complain of, if I\u2019m going to do what I was born for\u2014the things I was brought into the world to do? Or is this what I was created for? To huddle under the blankets and stay warm? \u2014But it\u2019s nicer here. . . . So you were born to feel \u201cnice? Instead of doing things and experiencing them? Don\u2019t you see the plants, the birds, the ants and spiders and bees going about their individual tasks, putting the world in order, as best they can? And you\u2019re not willing to do your job as a human being? Why aren\u2019t you running to do what your nature demands? \u2014But we have to sleep sometime. . . . Agreed. But nature set a limit on that\u2014as it did on eating and drinking. And you\u2019re over the limit. You\u2019ve had more than enough of that. But not of working. There you\u2019re still below your quota. You don\u2019t love yourself enough. Or you\u2019d love your nature too, and what it demands of you. People who love what they do wear themselves down doing it, they even forget to wash or eat. Do you have less respect for your own nature than the engraver does for engraving, the dancer for the dance, the miser for money or the social climber for status? When they\u2019re really possessed by what they do, they\u2019d rather stop eating and sleeping than give up practicing their arts. Is helping others less valuable to you? Not worth your effort?\u201d","Is any man afraid of change? Why what can take place without change? What then is more pleasing or more suitable to the universal nature? And canst thou take a bath unless the wood undergoes a change? And canst thou be nourished, unless the food undergoes a change? And can anything else that is useful be accomplished without change? Dost thou not see then that for thyself also to change is just the same, and equally necessary for the universal nature?

Manifest more then the body that surrounds yourself.","III. Do, soul, do; abuse and contemn thyself; yet a while and the time for thee to respect thyself, will be at an end. Every man\'s happiness depends from himself, but behold thy life is almost at an end, whiles affording thyself no respect, thou dost make thy happiness to consist in the souls, and conceits of other men. IV. Why should any of these things that happen externally, so much distract thee? Give thyself leisure to learn some good thing, and cease roving and wandering to and fro. Thou must also take heed of another kind of wandering, for they are idle in their actions, who toil and labour in this life, and have no certain scope to which to direct all their motions, and desires.","Moreover, to endure labour; nor to need many things; when I have anything to do, to do it myself rather than by others; not to meddle with many businesses; and not easily to admit of any slander.","If you suppose that the things that are not within your power are good or bad for you, then if you suffer a bad thing or the loss of a good thing, you will blame the gods and hate men, too: those who are the cause of the misfortune or the loss, or those who are suspected of being the likely cause; and indeed we do a great injustice when we dwell on such matters. But if we judge only those things that are in our power to be good or bad, there remains no reason either for finding fault with God or standing in a hostile attitude to man.","1. Our inward power, when it obeys nature, reacts to events by accommodating itself to what it faces\u2014to what is possible. It needs no specific material. It pursues its own aims as circumstances allow; it turns obstacles into fuel. As a fire overwhelms what would have quenched a lamp. What\u2019s thrown on top of the conflagration is absorbed, consumed by it\u2014and makes it burn still higher.","FROM my grandfather Verus I learned good morals and the government of my temper.\xa0 From the reputation and remembrance of my father, modesty and a manly character.

But in the things which are held together by nature there is within and there abides in them the power which made them; wherefore the more is it fit to reverence this power, and to think, that, if thou dost live and act according to its will, everything in thee is in conformity to intelligence.

But false straightforwardness is like a knife in the back.\u201d","Everywhere, at each moment, you have the option: to accept this event with humility [will]; to treat this person as he should be treated [action]; to approach this thought with care, so that nothing irrational creeps in [perception].","things you think about determine the quality of your mind.

And this happens, if when they do wrong it occurs to you that they are fellow humans and that they do wrong through ignorance and unintentionally, and that soon both of you will die; and above all, that the wrongdoer has done you no harm, for he has not made your ruling faculty worse than it was before.","To stop talking about what the good man is like, and just be one.","Whatever this is that I am, it is a little flesh and breath, and the ruling part. Throw away thy books; no longer distract thyself: it is not allowed; but as if thou wast now dying, despise the flesh; it is blood and bones and a network, a contexture of nerves, veins, and arteries. See the breath also, what kind of a thing it is, air, and not always the same, but every moment sent out and again sucked in. The third then is the ruling part: consider thus: Thou art an old man; no longer let this be a slave, no longer be pulled by the strings like a puppet to unsocial movements, no longer be either dissatisfied with thy present lot, or shrink from the future.","What then is that which is able to conduct a man? One thing and only one, philosophy. But this consists in keeping the daemon within a man free from violence and unharmed, superior to pains and pleasures, doing nothing without purpose, nor yet falsely and with hypocrisy, not feeling the need of another man\u2019s doing or not doing anything; and besides, accepting all that happens, and all that is allotted, as coming from thence, wherever it is, from whence he himself came; and, finally, waiting for death with a cheerful mind, as being nothing else than a dissolution of the elements of which every living being is compounded.","To the world: Your harmony is mine.

Or (more accurately) do what\u2019s essential\u2014what the logos of a social being requires, and in the requisite way. Which brings a double satisfaction: to do less, better. Because most of what we say and do is not essential. If you can eliminate it, you\u2019ll have more time, and more tranquillity.

How can I be unhappy when I have another opportunity to do what I was born to do? But it\u2019s so comfortable here. Were you born for this\u2014lying in bed under a warm blanket? Life is meant for action and exertion. Consider the ants, bees, and birds, working to bring order to their corners of the universe. Are you unwilling to do the work of a human being? But I worked yesterday; today I need to rest. Rest is for recharging, not for indulgence. Take only what is sufficient for your health and vitality. Too much rest\u2014like too much food or drink\u2014defeats its purpose, weakening the body and dulling the spirit. But I should love and care for myself. If you truly love yourself, love your nature and your vocation. Those who love their work become so absorbed in it, they don\u2019t even think of stopping. Do you love your work the way a dancer loves dancing and a painter loves painting? If not, why is your work less important to you than theirs is to them?","Not to be offended with other men\'s liberty of speech,","How ridiculous and what a stranger he is who is surprised at anything which happens in life.","17. To pursue the unattainable is insanity, yet the thoughtless can never refrain from doing so.","Stoics held that material objects alone existed; but immanent in the material universe was a spiritual force which acted through them, manifesting itself under many forms, as fire, aether, spirit, soul, reason, the ruling principle.","At every instant the objects and events in the world around us bombard us with impressions. As they do so they produce a phantasia, a mental impression. From this the mind generates a perception (hypolepsis), which might best be compared to a print made from a photographic negative. Ideally this print will be an accurate and faithful representation of the original. But it may not be. It may be blurred, or it may include shadow images that distort or obscure the original. Chief among these are inappropriate value judgments: the designation as \u201cgood or \u201cevil\u201d of things that in fact are neither good nor evil. For example, my impression that my house has just burned down is simply that\u2014an impression or report conveyed to me by my senses about an event in the outside world. By contrast, my perception that my house has burned down and I have thereby suffered a terrible tragedy includes not only an impression, but also an interpretation imposed upon that initial impression by my powers of hypolepsis. It is by no means the only possible interpretation, and I am not obliged to accept it. I may be a good deal better off if I decline to do so. It is, in other words, not objects and events but the interpretations we place on them that are the problem. Our duty is therefore to exercise stringent control over the faculty of perception, with the aim of protecting our mind from error.\u201d","5. Concentrate every minute like a Roman\u2014like a man\u2014on doing what\u2019s in front of you with precise and genuine seriousness, tenderly, willingly, with justice. And on freeing yourself from all other distractions. Yes, you can\u2014if you do everything as if it were the last thing you were doing in your life, and stop being aimless, stop letting your emotions override what your mind tells you, stop being hypocritical, self-centered, irritable. You see how few things you have to do to live a satisfying and reverent life? If you can manage this, that\u2019s all even the gods can ask of you.","The second discipline, that of action, relates to our relationship with other people. Human beings, for Marcus as for the Stoics generally, are social animals, a point he makes often (e.g., 5.16, 8.59, 9.1). All human beings possess not only a share of the logos but also the ability to use it (that is what makes us human and distinguishes us from other animals). But it would perhaps be more accurate to say that we are participants in the logos, which is as much a process as a substance. Marcus himself more than once compares the world ruled by logos to a city in which all human beings are citizens, with all the duties inherent in citizenship. As human beings we are part of nature, and our duty is to accommodate ourselves to its demands and requirements\u2014\u201cto live as nature requires, as Marcus often puts it. To do this we must make proper use of the logos we have been allotted, and perform as best we can the functions assigned us in the master plan of the larger, cosmic logos, of which it is a part. This requires not merely passive acquiescence in what happens, but active cooperation with the world, with fate and, above all, with other human beings. We were made, Marcus tells us over and over, not for ourselves but for others, and our nature is fundamentally unselfish. In our relationships with others we must work for their collective good, while treating them justly and fairly as individuals.\u201d","Don\u2019t look at things the way wrong-doers do. Don\u2019t look at things as wrong-doers want you too, either. Instead, strive to see things in truth, as they really are.","My city and my country, as I am Antoninus, is Rome; as I am a man, it is the world.","To the gods I am indebted for having good grandfathers, good parents, a good sister, good teachers, good associates, good kinsmen and friends, nearly everything good.","That whenever I felt like helping someone who was short of money, or otherwise in need, I never had to be told that I had no resources to do it with. And that I was never put in that position myself\u2014of having to take something from someone else.","Altogether the interval is small between birth and death; and consider with how much trouble, and in company with what sort of people and in what a feeble body this interval is laboriously passed. Do not then consider life a thing of any value. For look to the immensity of time behind thee, and to the time which is before thee, another boundless space. In this infinity then what is the difference between him who lives three days and him who lives three generations?","Whatever this is that I am, it is flesh and a little spirit and an intelligence. Throw away your books; stop letting yourself be distracted. That is not allowed. Instead, as if you were dying right now, despise your flesh. A mess of blood, pieces of bone, a woven tangle of nerves, veins, arteries. Consider what the spirit is: air, and never the same air, but vomited out and gulped in again every instant. Finally, the intelligence.Think of it this way: You are an old man. Stop allowing your mind to be a slave, to be jerked about by selfish impulses, to kick against fate and the present, and to mistrust the future.","The third discipline, the discipline of will, is in a sense the counterpart to the second, the discipline of action. The latter governs our approach to the things in our control, those that we do; the discipline of will governs our attitude to things that are not within our control, those that we have done to us (by others or by nature). We control our own actions and are responsible for them. If we act wrongly, then we have done serious harm to ourselves (though not, it should be emphasized, to others, or to the logos). By contrast, things outside our control have no ability to harm us. Acts of wrongdoing by a human agent (torture, theft, or other crimes) harm the agent, not the victim. Acts of nature such as fire, illness, or death can harm us only if we choose to see them as harmful. When we do so, we question the benevolence and providence of the logos, and thereby degrade our own logos. This, of course, we must not do. Instead we must see things for what they are (here the discipline of perception is relevant) and accept them, by exercising the discipline of will, or what Epictetus calls (in a phrase quoted by Marcus) \u201cthe art of acquiescence. For if we recognize that all events have been foreseen by the logos and form part of its plan, and that the plan in question is unfailingly good (as it must be), then it follows that we must accept whatever fate has in store for us, however unpleasant it may appear, trusting that, in Alexander Pope\u2019s phrase, \u201cwhatever is, is right.\u201d This applies to all obstacles and (apparent) misfortunes, and in particular to death\u2014a process that we cannot prevent, which therefore does not harm us, and which accordingly we must accept willingly as natural and proper.\u201d","Anywhere you can lead your life, you can lead a good one.","The world is nothing but change. Our life is only perception.","to how much envy and fraud and hypocrisy the state of a tyrannous king is subject unto, and how they who are commonly called [Eupatridas Gk.], i.e. nobly born, are in some sort incapable, or void of natural affection.","that that life which any the longest liver, or the shortest liver parts with, is for length and duration the very same, for that only which is present, is that, which either of them can lose, as being that only which they have; for that which he hath not, no man can truly be said to lose.","If it is not right, do not do it: if it is not true, do not say it.","Disgraceful if, in this life where your body does not fail, your soul should fail you first.","\u0644\u0627\u0645\u062c\u062f \u0644\u0643 \u0628\u0645\u0639\u0632\u0644 \u0639\u0646 \u0645\u062c\u062f \u0642\u0648\u0645\u0643 . \u0645\u0627\u0644\u0627 \u064a\u0641\u064a\u062f \u0627\u0644\u0633\u0631\u0628 \u0644\u0627\u064a\u0641\u064a\u062f \u0627\u0644\u0646\u062d\u0644\u0629 . \u0644\u0627\u0645\u062c\u062f \u0644\u0646\u062d\u0644\u0629 \u0641\u064a \u062e\u0644\u064a\u0629 \u0645\u0646\u0647\u0627\u0631\u0629","My soul, will you ever be good, simple, individual, bare, brighter than the body covers you?

It is most necessary to bear this constantly in mind, for thus thou wilt be more gentle towards all.","Keep before your eyes the swift onset of oblivion, and the abysses of eternity before us and behind; mark how hollow are the echoes of applause, how fickle and undiscerning the judgments of professed admirers, and how puny the arena of human fame. For the entire earth is but a point, and the place of our own habitation but a minute corner in it; and how many are therein who will praise you, and what sort of men are they?","No random actions, none not based on underlying principles.","It is circumstances (difficulties) which show what men are. Therefore when a difficulty falls upon you, remember that God, like a trainer of wrestlers, has matched you with a rough young man. For what purpose? you may say. Why, that you may become an Olympic conqueror; but it is not accomplished without sweat. In my opinion no man has had a more profitable difficulty than you have had, if you choose to make use of it as an athlete would deal with a young antagonist.","I walk in Nature\'s way until I shall lie down and rest, breathing my last in this from which I draw my daily breath, and lying down on this from which my father drew his vital seed, my mother her blood, my nurse her milk; from which for so many years I am fed and watered day by day; which bears my footstep and my misusing it for so many purposes.","Remember how long thou hast already put off these things, and how often a certain day and hour as it were, having been set unto thee by the gods, thou hast neglected it.","Remember this, that very little is needed to make a happy life.","You should take no action unwillingly, selfishly, uncritically, or with conflicting motives. Do not dress up your thoughts in smart finery: do not be a gabbler or a meddler. Further, let the god that is within you be the champion of the being you are a male, mature in years, a statesman, a Roman, a ruler: one who has taken his post like a soldier waiting for the Retreat from life to sound, and ready to depart, past the need for any loyal oath or human witness. And see that you keep a cheerful demeanour, and retain your independence of outside help and the peace which others can give. Your duty is to stand straight - not held straight.","The truly fortunate person has created his own good fortune through good habits of the soul, good intentions, and good actions.","How much more damage anger and grief do than the things that cause them.","Let not the general representation unto thyself of the wretchedness of this our mortal life, trouble thee.","Some men, when they do you a kindness, at once demand the payment of gratitude from you; others are more modest than this. However, they remember the favor, and look upon you as their debtor in a manner. A third sort shall scarce know what they have done. These are much like a vine, which is satisfied by being fruitful in its kind, and bears a bunch of grapes without expecting any thanks for it. A fleet horse or greyhound do not make a noise when they have done well, nor a bee neither when she has made a little honey. And thus a man that has done a kindness never proclaims it, but does another as soon as he can, just like a vine that bears again the next season.

Labour not as one to whom it is appointed to be wretched, nor as one that either would be pitied, or admired; but let this be thine only care and desire; so always and in all things to prosecute or to forbear, as the law of charity, or mutual society doth require.","Do not look around to discover other people\'s ruling principles, but look straight to this, to what nature leads you, both the universal nature through which things happen to you, and your own nature through the acts which must be done by you.","Let no act be done without a purpose,","If you don\u2019t have a consistent goal in life, you can\u2019t live it in a consistent way.","The universe, then, is God, of whom the popular gods are manifestations; while legends and myths are allegorical. The soul of man is thus an emanation from the godhead, into whom it will eventually be re-absorbed.","Through not observing what is in the mind of another a man has seldom been seen to be unhappy; but those who do not observe the movements of their own minds must of necessity be unhappy.","No carelessness in your actions. No confusion in your words. No imprecision in your thoughts. No retreating into your own soul, or trying to escape it. No overactivity. They kill you, cut you with knives, shower you with curses. And that somehow cuts your mind off from clearness, and sanity, and self-control, and justice? A man standing by a spring of clear, sweet water and cursing it. While the fresh water keeps on bubbling up. He can shovel mud into it, or dung, and the stream will carry it away, wash itself clean, remain unstained. To have that. Not a cistern but a perpetual spring. How? By working to win your freedom. Hour by hour.

Virtue is virtue, and in both cases the result is happiness for the one who is virtuous.","He claimed that a man\'s life should be valued according to the value of the things to which he gave his attention.","The existence of evil does not harm the world. And an individual act of evil does not harm the victim. Only one person is harmed by it\u2014and he can stop being harmed as soon as he decides to.","To be free of passion and yet full of love.","BEGIN the morning by saying to thyself, I shall meet with the busy-body, the ungrateful, arrogant, deceitful, envious, unsocial.

To act against one another then is contrary to nature; and it is acting against one another to be vexed and to turn away.","We shrink from change; yet is there anything that can come into being without it?","He is an abscess on the universe who withdraws and separates himself from the reason of our common nature through being displeased with the things that happen; for the same nature that produces these things has produced you, too:","Your character is simply the sum of your thoughts over time.","The soul of man is thus an emanation from the godhead, into whom it will eventually be re-absorbed. The divine ruling principle makes all things work together for good, but for the good of the whole. The highest good of man is consciously to work with God for the common good, and this is the sense in which the Stoic tried to live in accord with nature. In the individual it is virtue alone which enables him to do this; as Providence rules the universe, so virtue in the soul must rule man.","Look in, let not either the proper quality, or the true worth of anything pass thee, before thou hast fully it.","Think of yourself as dead.

Now take what\'s left and live it properly.","For the present is the only thing of which a man can be deprived, if it is true that this is the only thing which he has, and that a man cannot lose a thing if he has it not.","Jangan mencintai apapun kecuali yang datang padamu,karena adakah yang dapat memenuhi kebutuhanmu dengan lebih tepat?","From Alexander the Platonic, not frequently nor without necessity to say to any one, or to write in a letter, that I have not leisure; nor continually to excuse the neglect of duties required by our relations to those with whom we live, by alleging urgent occupations.","They seek for themselves private retiring places, as country villages, the sea-shore, mountains; yea thou thyself art wont to long much after such places. But all this thou must know proceeds from simplicity in the highest degree. At what time soever thou wilt, it is in thy power to retire into thyself, and to be at rest, and free from all businesses. A man cannot any whither retire better than to his own soul; he especially who is beforehand provided of such things within, which whensoever he doth withdraw himself to look in, may presently afford unto him perfect ease and tranquillity.","With respect to pain, then, and pleasure, or death and life, or honour and dishonour, which the universal nature employs equally, whoever is not equally affected is manifestly acting impiously.","Dig deep; the water- goodness- is down there. And as long as you keep digging, it will keep bubbling up","It is precisely its unorthodox touches\u2014its intimation of the idea of a personal god, its flashes of vulnerability and pain, its unwavering commitment to virtue above pleasure and to tranquillity above happiness, its unmistakable stamp of an uncompromisingly honest soul seeking the light of grace in a dark world\u2014that lend the work its special power to charm and inspire.","Short-lived are both the praiser and the praised; and the rememberer and the remembered; and all this in a nook of this part of the world; and not even here do all agree; no not anyone with himself; and the whole earth too is a point.","The noblest kind retribution is to become not like your enemy,","And indeed he who pursues pleasure as good, and avoids pain as evil, is guilty of impiety.","To enter others\u2019 minds and let them enter yours.","How rotten and spurious is the man who says: \u201cI have decided to be straightforward with you.","Thou must be like a promontory of the sea, against which though the waves beat continually, yet it both itself stands, and about it are those swelling waves stilled and quieted.","refrain from all anger and passion.","4.

When you have done a good act and another has received it, why do you look for a third thing besides these, as fools do, either to have the reputation of having done a good act or to obtain a return?","But Marcus Aurelius knows that what the heart is full of, the man will do. \'Such as thy thoughts and ordinary cogitations are,\' he says, \'such will thy mind be in time.\' And every page of the book shows us that he knew thought was sure to issue in act. He drills his soul, as it were, in right principles, that when the time comes, it may be guided by them. To wait until the emergency is to be too late.","Consider individuals, survey men in general; there is none whose life does not look forward to the morrow. \\"What harm is there in this,\\" you ask? Infinite harm; for such persons do not live, but are preparing to live. They postpone everything. Even if we paid strict attention, life would soon get ahead of us; but as we are now, life finds us lingering and passes us by as if it belonged to another, and though it ends on the final day, it perishes every day. But I must not exceed the bounds of a letter, which ought not to fill the reader\'s left hand. So I shall postpone to another day our case against the hair-splitters, those over-subtle fellows who make argumentation supreme instead of subordinate. Farewell. Letter XLVI - On a New Book by Lucilius I received the book of yours which you promised me. I opened it hastily with the idea of glancing over it at leisure; for I meant only to taste the volume. But by its own charm the book coaxed me into traversing it more at length. You may understand from this fact how eloquent it was;","If thou workest at that which is before thee, following right reason seriously, vigorously, calmly, without allowing anything else to distract thee, but keeping thy divine part pure, as if thou shouldst be bound to give it back immediately; if thou holdest to this, expecting nothing, fearing nothing, but satisfied with thy present activity according to nature, and with heroic truth in every word and sound which thou utterest, thou wilt live happy. And there is no man who is able to prevent this.","Salvation: to see each thing for what it is\u2014 its nature and its purpose.To do only what is right, say only what is true, without holding back.What else could it be but to live life fully\u2014 to pay out goodnesslike the rings of a chain, without the slightest gap.","You may leave this life at any moment: have this possibility in your mind in all that you do or say or think. Now departure from the world of men is nothing to fear. If gods exist: because they would not involve you in any harm. If they do not exist, or if they have no care for humankind, then what is life to me in a world devoid of gods, or devoid of providence?","Not to be overwhelmed by what you imagine, but just do what you can and should. And","Remember, too, on every occasion that leads you to vexation to apply this principle: not that this is a misfortune, but that to bear it nobly is good fortune.","short, know this: Human lives are brief and trivial. Yesterday a blob of semen; tomorrow embalming fluid, ash. To pass through this brief life as nature demands. To give it up without complaint. Like an olive that ripens and falls. Praising its mother, thanking the tree it grew on.","If asked, he would no doubt have responded that \u201ctrue slavery is the self-enslavement of the mind to emotion and desire\u201d","29. Stop whatever you\u2019re doing for a moment and ask yourself: Am I afraid of death because I won\u2019t be able to do this anymore?","17. If a thing is in your own power, why do you do it? But if it is in the power of another, whom do you blame? The atoms (chance) or the gods? Both are foolish. You must blame nobody. For if you can, correct that which is the cause; but if you cannot do this, correct at least the thing itself; but if you cannot do even this, of what use is it to you to find fault? For nothing should be done without a purpose.","To pass through this brief life as nature demands. To give it up without complaint. Like an olive that ripens and falls. Praising its mother, thanking the tree it grew on.","Wait for it patiently\u2014annihilation or metamorphosis.","offences which are committed through desire are more blameable than those which are committed through anger. For he who is excited by anger seems to turn away from reason with a certain pain and unconscious contraction; but he who offends through desire, being overpowered by pleasure, seems to be in a manner more intemperate and more womanish in his offences.","Nothing befalls anything which that thing is not naturally made to bear. The same experience befalls another, and he is unruffled and remains unharmed; either because he is unaware that it has happened or because he exhibits greatness of soul. Is it not strange that ignorance and complaisance are stronger than wisdom...?","XV. Is any man so foolish as to fear change, to which all things that once were not owe their being? And","Do the things external which fall upon thee distract thee? Give thyself time to learn something new and good, and cease to be whirled around. But then thou must also avoid being carried about the other way. For those too are triflers who have wearied themselves in life by their activity, and yet have no object to which to direct every movement, and, in a word, all their thoughts.","It is the act of an ill-instructed man to blame others for his own bad condition; it is the act of one who has begun to be instructed, to lay the blame on himself; and of one whose instruction is completed, neither to blame another, nor himself.","Remind yourself too that each of us lives only in the present moment, a mere fragment of time: the rest is life past or uncertain future.","Art thou angry with him whose armpits stink? Art thou angry with him whose mouth smells foul? What good will this danger do thee? He has such a mouth, he has such arm-pits: it is necessary that such an emanation must come from such things- but the man has reason, it will be said, and he is able, if he takes pain, to discover wherein he offends- I wish thee well of thy discovery. Well then, and thou hast reason: by thy rational faculty stir up his rational faculty; show him his error, admonish him. For if he listens, thou wilt cure him, and there is no need of anger.","The art of living is more like wrestling than dancing, in as much as it, too, demands a from and watchful stance against any unexpected onset","Everywhere and continually it is in your power to be reverently content with your present circumstance, to behave to men who are present with you according to right and to handle skillfully the present impression, that nothing you have not mastered may cross the threshold of the mind.","You\u2019ve seen that. Now look at this. Don\u2019t be disturbed. Uncomplicate yourself. Someone has done wrong \u2026 to himself. Something happens to you. Good. It was meant for you by nature, woven into the pattern from the beginning. Life is short. That\u2019s all there is to say. Get what you can from the present\u2014thoughtfully, justly. Unrestrained moderation.","Though thou shouldst be going to live three thousand years, and as many times ten thousand years, still remember that no man loses any other life than this which he now lives, nor lives any other than this which he now loses.","Finally, therefore, remember your retreat into this little domain which is yourself, and above all be not disturbed nor on the rack, but be free and look at things as a man, a human being, a citizen, a creature that must die.","Is any man afraid of change? Why what can take place without change? What then is more pleasing or more suitable to the universal nature? And canst thou take a bath unless the wood undergoes a change? And canst thou be nourished, unless the food undergoes a change?

For you will be ashamed to confess. In the next place remember that neither the future nor the past pains you, but only the present. But this is reduced to a very little, if you only circumscribe it and chide your mind, if it is unable to hold out against even this.","What stands in the way becomes the way.","Do nothing against thy will, nor contrary to the community, nor without due examination, nor with reluctancy.","Think, let us say, of the times of Vespasian; and what do you see? Men and women busy marrying, bringing up children, sickening, dying, fighting, feasting, chaffering, farming, flattering, bragging, envying, scheming, calling down curses, grumbling at fate, loving, hoarding, coveting thrones and dignities. Of all that life, not a trace survives today. Or come forward to the days of Trajan; again, it is the same; that life, too, has perished. Take a similar look at the records of other past ages and peoples; mark how one and all, after their short-lived strivings, passed away and were resolved into the elements. More especially, recall some who, within your own knowledge, have followed after vanities instead of contenting themselves with a resolute performance of the duties for which they were created. In such cases it is essential to remind ourselves that the pursuit of any object depends for its value upon the worth of the object pursued. If, then, you would avoid discouragement, never become unduly absorbed in things that are not of the first importance.","on every occasion a man should ask himself, Is this one of the unnecessary things?","Wherever you go, there you are\u2014the same person, with the same patterns of thought.","Every portion of me will be reassigned as another portion of the world, and that in turn transformed into another.

For nothing so promotes elevation of mind as the ability to examine methodically and truly every object that is presented to you in life, and always to look at things so as to see at the same time what kind of universe this is, and what kind of use everything performs in it, and what value everything has with reference to the whole, and what with reference to man, who is a citizen of the highest city, of which all other cities are like families; what each thing is, its composition and duration, and what virtue I need bring to it, such as gentleness, manliness, truth, fidelity, simplicity, contentment, and the rest.","The prime principle then in man\u2019s constitution is the social. And the second is not to yield to the persuasions of the body,\u2014for it is the peculiar office of the rational and intelligent motion to circumscribe itself, and never to be overpowered either by the motion of the senses or of the appetites, for both are animal: but the intelligent motion claims superiority, and does not permit itself to be overpowered by the others.","In all his conversation, far from all inhumanity, all boldness, and incivility, all greediness and impetuosity; never doing anything with such earnestness, and intention, that a man could say of him, that he did sweat about it: but contrariwise, all things distinctly, as at leisure; without trouble; orderly, soundly, and agreeably.","Casting therefore all other things aside, keep thyself to these few, and remember withal that no man properly can be said to live more than that which is now present, which is but a moment of time.","to conclude the matter, what is even an eternal remembrance?

Then why such turmoil?","The pomps and glories which he despised were all his; what to most men is an ambition or a dream, to him was a round of weary tasks which nothing but the stern sense of duty could carry him through. And he did his work well.","If our intellectual part is common, the reason also, in respect of which we are rational beings, is common: if this is so, common also is the reason which commands us what to do, and what not to do; if this is so, there is a common law also; if this is so, we are fellow-citizens; if this is so, we are members of some political community; if this is so, the world is in a manner a state.","Thou art a little soul bearing about a corpse, as Epictetus used to say. It is no evil for things to undergo change, and no good for things to subsist in consequence of change.","Let the part of your soul that leads and governs be undisturbed by the movements in the flesh, whether of pleasure or of pain; and let it not unite with them, but let it circumscribe itself and limit those affects to their parts. But when these affects rise up to the mind by virtue of that other sympathy that naturally exists in a body that is all one, then you must not strive to resist the sensation, for it is natural: but do not let the ruling part of itself add to the sensation the opinion that it is either good or bad.","The power which rules within us, when its state is accordant with nature, so acts in every occurrence as easily to adapt itself to all present or possible situations. It requires no set material to work upon, but, under proper reservation, needs but the incitement to pursue, and makes matter for its activities out of every opposition. Even so a fire masters that which is cast upon it, and though a small flame would have been extinguished, your great blaze quickly makes the added fuel its own, consumes it, and grows mightier therefrom.","30. A philosopher without clothes and one without books. \u201cI have nothing to eat, says he, as he stands there half-naked, \u201cbut I subsist on the logos.\u201d And with nothing to read, I subsist on it too.\u201d","This world is mere change, and this life, opinion.","Do the things external which fall upon thee distract thee? Give thyself time to learn something new and good, and cease to be whirled around. But then thou must also avoid being carried about the other way; for those too are triflers who have wearied themselves in life by their activity, and yet have no object to which to direct every movement, and, in a word, all their thoughts.","Remember, however, that thou art formed by nature to bear everything, with respect to which it depends on thy own opinion to make it endurable and tolerable, by thinking that it is either thy interest or thy duty to do this.","Man must consider, not only that each day part of his life is spent, and that less and less remains to him, but also that, even if he live longer, it is very uncertain whether his intelligence will suffice as heretofore for the understanding of his affairs, and for grasping that knowledge which aims at comprehending things human and divine. When dotage begins, breath, nourishment, fancy, impulse, and so forth will not fail him. But self-command, accurate appreciation of duty, power to scrutinize what strikes his senses, or even to decide whether he should take his departure, all powers, indeed, which demand a well-trained understanding, must be extinguished in him. Let him be up and doing then, not only because death comes nearer every day, but because understanding and intelligence often leave us before we die.","You have sent a letter to me through the hand of a \\"friend\\" of yours, as you call him. And in your very next sentence you warn me not to discuss with him all the matters that concern you, saying that even you yourself are not accustomed to do this; in other words, you have in the same letter affirmed and denied that he is your friend.","Because most of what we say and do is not essential. If you can eliminate it, you\u2019ll have more time, and more tranquillity. Ask yourself at every moment, \u201cIs this necessary?","Among the animals which have not reason one life is distributed; but among reasonable animals one intelligent soul is distributed: just as there is one earth of all things which are of an earthy nature, and we see by one light, and breathe one air, all of us that have the faculty of vision and all that have life. All","XII. From Claudius Maximus, in all things to endeavour to have power of myself, and in nothing to be carried about; to be cheerful and courageous in all sudden chances and accidents, as in sicknesses: to love mildness, and moderation, and gravity: and to do my business, whatsoever it be, thoroughly, and without querulousness. Whatsoever he said, all men believed him that as he spake, so he thought, and whatsoever he did, that he did it with a good intent. His manner was, never to wonder at anything; never to be in haste, and yet never slow: nor to be perplexed, or dejected, or at any time unseemly, or excessively to laugh: nor to be angry, or suspicious, but ever ready to do good, and to forgive, and to speak truth; and all this, as one that seemed rather of himself to have been straight and right, than ever to have been rectified or redressed; neither was there any man that ever thought himself undervalued by him, or that could find in his heart, to think himself a better man than he. He would also be very pleasant and gracious.","5. Thou sayest, Men cannot admire the sharpness of thy wits.\u2014Be it so: but there are many other things of which thou canst not say, I am not formed from them by nature. Show those qualities then which are altogether in thy power, sincerity, gravity, endurance of labor, aversion to pleasure, contentment with thy portion and with few things, benevolence, frankness, no love of superfluity, freedom from trifling, magnanimity. Dost thou not see how many qualities thou art immediately able to exhibit, in which there is no excuse of natural incapacity and unfitness, and yet thou still remainest voluntarily below the mark? or art thou compelled through being defectively furnished by nature to murmur, and to be stingy, and to flatter, and to find fault with thy poor body, and to try to please men, and to make great display, and to be so restless in thy mind? No, by the gods; but thou mightest have been delivered from these things long ago. Only if in truth thou canst be charged with being rather slow and dull of comprehension, thou must exert thyself about this also, not neglecting it nor yet taking pleasure in thy dullness.","For then thou wilt neither blame those who offend involuntarily, nor wilt thou want their approbation, if thou lookest to the sources of their opinions and appetites.","Budi poput kr\u0161evite obale o koju se neprestance lome valovi. Ona stoji postojano, a oko nje uzavrele vode polako se smiruju.","5. Every moment think steadily as a Roman and a man to do what thou hast in hand with perfect and simple dignity, and feeling of affection, and freedom, and justice; and to give thyself relief from all other thoughts. And thou wilt give thyself relief, if thou doest every act of thy life as if it were the last, laying aside all carelessness and passionate aversion from the commands of reason, and all hypocrisy, and self-love, and discontent with the portion which has been given to thee.","Change: nothing inherently bad in the process, nothing inherently good in the result.","So there are two reasons to embrace what happens. One is that it\u2019s happening to you. It was prescribed for you, and it pertains to you. The thread was spun long ago, by the oldest cause of all. The other reason is that what happens to an individual is a cause of well-being in what directs the world\u2014of its well-being, its fulfillment, of its very existence, even. Because the whole is damaged if you cut away anything\u2014anything at all\u2014from its continuity and its coherence. Not only its parts, but its purposes. And that\u2019s what you\u2019re doing when you complain: hacking and destroying.","Truly a rare opportunity was given to Marcus Aurelius of showing what the mind can do in despite of circumstances. Most peaceful of warriors, a magnificent monarch whose ideal was quiet happiness in home life, bent to obscurity yet born to greatness, the loving father of children who died young or turned out hateful, his life was one paradox. That nothing might lack, it was in camp before the face of the enemy that he passed away and went to his own place.","People out for posthumous fame forget that the Generations To Come will be the same annoying people they know now.","We must make haste then, not only because we are daily nearer death, but also because the conception of things and the understanding of them cease first.","Real good luck would be to abandon life without ever encountering dishonesty, or hypocrisy, or self-indulgence, or pride. But the \u201cnext best voyage is to die when you\u2019ve had enough. Or are you determined to lie down with evil? Hasn\u2019t experience even taught you that\u2014to avoid it like the plague? Because it is a plague\u2014a mental cancer\u2014worse than anything caused by tainted air or an unhealthy climate. Diseases like that can only threaten your life; this one attacks your humanity.\u201d","-Moja lo\u0161a sre\u0107a kriva je \u0161to me to sna\u0161lo.-Ne, radije reci: Moja je sre\u0107a, \u0161to, iako me to sna\u0161lo, mogu sve to otrpjeti bez patnje, da me sada\u0161njica ne zdrobi, i da ne strepim pred budu\u0107no\u0161\u0107u.","The present is all that they can give up, since that is all you have, and what you do not have, you cannot lose.","It is no evil for things to undergo change, and no good for things to subsist in consequence of change. 43.","And he who pursues pleasure will not abstain from injustice, and this is plainly impiety.","Remember: philosophy requires only what your nature already demands. What you\u2019ve been after is something else again\u2014something unnatural.","It isn\'t ceasing to live that [I\'m] afraid of but never beginning to live properly\u0632","It isn\'t ceasing to live that [I\'m] afraid of but never beginning to live properly.","Es rid\xedculo no intentar evitar tu propia maldad, lo cual es posible, y, en cambio, intentar evitar la de los dem\xe1s, lo cual es lo imposible.","Remember that our efforts are subject to circumstances; you weren\u2019t aiming to do the impossible. \u2014Aiming to do what, then? To try. And you succeeded. What you set out to do is accomplished.","As for life therefore, and death, honour and dishonour, labour and pleasure, riches and poverty, all these things happen unto men indeed, both good and bad, equally; but as things which of themselves are neither good nor bad; because of themselves, neither shameful nor praiseworthy.","Independence and unvarying reliability, and to pay attentionto nothing, no matter how fleetingly, except the logos.

And to see clearly, from his example,that a man can show both strength and flexibility.His patience in teaching. And to have seen someone whoclearly viewed his expertise and ability as a teacher as thehumblest of virtues.And to have learned how to accept favors from friendswithout losing your self-respect or appearing ungrateful.On Apolonius","Manage all your actions, words, and thoughts accordingly, since you may at any moment quit life.","Remember that to change your mind and to accept correction are free acts too. The action is yours, based on your own will, your own decision\u2014and your own mind.","If any man can convince and show me that I do not think or act right, I will gladly change; for I seek truth, by which no man was ever injured. But he is injured who abides in his error and ignorance.","Live as though today is your last day.","Perfection of character: to live your last day, every day, without frenzy, or sloth, or pretense","Now forget what they think of you. Be satisfied if you can live the rest of your life, however short, as your nature demands. Focus on that, and don\u2019t let anything distract you. You\u2019ve wandered all over and finally realized that you never found what you were after: how to live. Not in syllogisms, not in money, or fame, or self-indulgence. Nowhere.","If you are distressed about anything, the pain is not one to the thing but to your own estimate to it.","When thou hast assumed these names, good, modest, true, rational, a man of equanimity, and magnanimous, take care that thou dost not change these names; and if thou shouldst lose them, quickly return to them. And remember that the term Rational was intended to signify a discriminating attention to every several thing and freedom from negligence; and that Equanimity is the voluntary acceptance of the things","None of us have much time. And yet you act as if things were eternal\u2014the way you fear and long for them.\u2026 Before long, darkness. And whoever buries you mourned in their turn.","He was taught to dress plainly and to live simply, to avoid all softness and luxury.","The freedom to do only what God wants, and accept whatever God sends us.","Some things are hurrying into existence, and others are hurrying out of it;","What man can you show me who places any value on his time, who reckons the worth of each day, who understands that he is dying daily? For we are mistaken when we look forward to death; the major portion of death has already passed. Whatever years be behind us are in death\'s hands.","Stoicism is thus from the outset a deterministic system that appears to leave no room for human free will or moral responsibility. In reality the Stoics were reluctant to accept such an arrangement, and attempted to get around the difficulty by defining free will as a voluntary accommodation to what is in any case inevitable. According to this theory, man is like a dog tied to a moving wagon. If the dog refuses to run along with the wagon he will be dragged by it, yet the choice remains his: to run or be dragged.","His education was conducted with all care. The ablest teachers were engaged for him, and he was trained in the strict doctrine of the Stoic philosophy, which was his great delight. He was taught to dress plainly and to live simply, to avoid all softness and luxury. His body was trained to hardihood by wrestling, hunting, and outdoor games; and though his constitution was weak, he showed great personal courage to encounter the fiercest boars. At the same time he was kept from the extravagancies of his day.","whilst yet thou livest, whilst thou mayest, be good.","tranquillity is nothing else than the good ordering of the mind.","A little wisp of soul carrying a corpse.\u2014Epictetus.\u201d","Continually, and, if possible, in the case of every mental image, consider its nature, realize its emotional content, and judge it rationally.","The way people behave. They refuse to admire their contemporaries, the people whose lives they share. No, but to be admired by Posterity -- people they\'ve never met and never will -- that\'s what they set their hearts on. You might as well be upset at not being a hero to your great-grandfather.","Constantly observe who those are whose approval you wish to have, and what ruling principles they possess. For then you will neither blame those who offend involuntarily, nor will you want their approval, if you look to the sources of their opinions and appetites.","Do, soul, do; abuse and contemn thyself; yet a while and the time for thee to respect thyself, will be at an end.","Yes, you can\u2014if you do everything as if it were the last thing you were doing in your life, and stop being aimless, stop letting your emotions override what your mind tells you, stop being hypocritical, self-centered, irritable.","What am I doing with my soul? Interrogate yourself, to find out what inhabits your so-called mind and what kind of soul you have now. A child\u2019s soul, an adolescent\u2019s, a woman\u2019s? A tyrant\u2019s soul? The soul of a predator\u2014or its prey?","You are a spirit, bearing the weight of a dead body, as Epictetus used to say.","Think often the connection of all things in the world and their mutual relations, they are arguably intertwined with each other and thus have for each other a mutual friendship, and that under the connection that leads him and the unity of matter","III. Hippocrates having cured many sicknesses, fell sick himself and died.","But cast away the thirst after books, that thou mayest not die murmuring, but cheerfully, truly, and from thy heart thankful to the gods.","If, at some point in your life, you should come across anything better than justice, prudence, self-control, courage\u2014than a mind satisfied that it has succeeded in enabling you to act rationally, and satisfied to accept what\u2019s beyond its control\u2014if you find anything better than that, embrace it without reservations\u2014it must be an extraordinary thing indeed\u2014and enjoy it to the full.","For a man cannot lose either the past or the future: for what a man has not, how can any one take this from him?","Don\u2019t be irritated at people\u2019s smell or bad breath. What\u2019s the point? With that mouth, with those armpits, they\u2019re going to produce that odor. \u2014But they have a brain! Can\u2019t they figure it out? Can\u2019t they recognize the problem? So you have a brain as well. Good for you. Then use your logic to awaken his. Show him. Make him realize it. If he\u2019ll listen, then you\u2019ll have solved the problem. Without anger.","Finally, in every event which leads you to sorrow, remember to use this principle: that this is not a misfortune, but that to bear it like a brave man is good fortune.","..a man cannot lose a thing if he has it not.","The mind is that which is roused and directed by itself. It makes of itself what it chooses. It makes what it chooses of its own experience.","How unsound and insincere is he who says, I have determined to deal with thee in a fair way.\u2014What art thou doing, man?","A prudent governor will not roughly oppose even the superstitions of his people; and though he may wish they were wiser, he will know that he cannot make them so by offending their prejudices.","Her \u015fey d\xfc\u015f\xfcncenin verdi\u011fi bi\xe7imi al\u0131r.

The rest is lost and behind us, or ahead of us and may never be found. Little of life we know, little the plot of earth on which we dwell, little the memory of even the most famous who have lived, and this memory itself is preserved by generations of little men, who know little about themselves and far less about those who died long ago. (Book 3, Verse 10)","Inquire of yourself as soon as you wake from sleep, whether it will make any difference to you, if another does what is just and right. It will make no difference.","Consider how quickly all things are dissolved and resolved: the bodies and substances themselves, into the matter and substance of the world: and their memories into the general age and time of the world.","To be cheerful, and to stand in no need, either of other men\'s help or attendance, or of that rest and tranquillity, which thou must be beholding to others for.

The end of sense-perception, of being controlled by our emotions, of mental activity, of enslavement to our bodies.","consider that for whatever purpose each thing has been constituted, for this it has been constituted, and towards this it is carried; and its end is in that towards which it is carried; and where the end is, there also is the advantage and the good of each thing. Now the good for the reasonable animal is society; for that we are made for society has been shown above.","I am composed of a body and a soul. Things that happen to the body are meaningless. It cannot discriminate among them. Nothing has meaning to my mind except its own actions. Which are within its own control. And it\u2019s only the immediate ones that matter. Its past and future actions too are meaningless.","And why is it so hard when things go against you? If it\u2019s imposed by nature, accept it gladly and stop fighting it. And if not, work out what your own nature requires, and aim at that, even if it brings you no glory.","If the gods have made decisions about me and the things that happen to me, then they were good decisions. (It\u2019s hard to picture a god who makes bad ones.) And why would they expend their energies on causing me harm? What good would it do them\u2014or the world, which is their primary concern? And if they haven\u2019t made decisions about me as an individual, they certainly have about the general welfare. And anything that follows from that is something I have to welcome and embrace. And if they make no decisions, about anything\u2014and it\u2019s blasphemous even to think so (because if so, then let\u2019s stop sacrificing, praying, swearing oaths, and doing all the other things we do, believing the whole time that the gods are right here with us)\u2014if they decide nothing about our lives . . . well, I can still make decisions. Can still consider what it\u2019s to my benefit to do. And what benefits anyone is to do what his own nature requires. And mine is rational. Rational and civic. My city and state are Rome\u2014as Antoninus. But as a human being? The world.

Of like fashion are sickness, death, calumny, intrigue, and all that gladdens or saddens the foolish.","He is a fugitive, he who flees from the reason that governs our soicial life; a blind man, he who closes the eyes of his mind; a beggar, he who depends on another and does not possess within himself all that is necessary for life; an abscess on the body of the universe, he who sets himself apart and cuts himself off from the reason of our common nature because he is dissatisfied with what comes to pass; for this is brought about by the same order of nature that brought you too into being.","to believe those things, which are commonly spoken, by such as take upon them to work wonders, and by sorcerers, or prestidigitators, and impostors; concerning the power of charms, and their driving out of demons, or evil spirits; and the like.

Him also I must thank, that ever I heard first Bacchius, then Tandasis and Marcianus, and that I did write dialogues in my youth; and that I took liking to the philosophers\' little couch and skins, and such other things, which by the Grecian discipline are proper to those who profess philosophy.","As for thy thirst after books, away with it with all speed.","Body. Soul. Mind. Sensations: the body. Desires: the soul. Reasoning: the mind. To experience sensations: even grazing beasts do that. To let your desires control you: even wild animals do that\u2014and rutting humans, and tyrants (from Phalaris to Nero . . .). To make your mind your guide to what seems best: even people who deny the gods do that. Even people who betray their country. Even people who do <. . .> behind closed doors. If all the rest is common coin, then what is unique to the good man? To welcome with affection what is sent by fate. Not to stain or disturb the spirit within him with a mess of false beliefs.

And if the others don\u2019t acknowledge it\u2014this life lived with simplicity, humility, cheerfulness\u2014he doesn\u2019t resent them for it, and isn\u2019t deterred from following the road where it leads: to the end of life. An end to be approached in purity, in serenity, in acceptance, in peaceful unity with what must be.","And those who complain and try to obstruct and thwart things\u2014they help as much as anyone. The world needs them as well.","To love only what happens, what was destined. No greater harmony.","How cruel it is not to allow a man to strive after the things which appear to them to be suitable to their nature and profitable! And yet in a manner thou dost not allow them to do this, when thou art vexed because they do wrong. For they are certainly moved towards things because they suppose them to be suitable to their nature and profitable to them - But it is not so - Teach them, then, and show them without being angry.","This is what you deserve. You could be good today. But instead you choose tomorrow.","Reverence that which is best in the universe; and this is that which makes use of all things and directs all things. And in like manner also reverence that which is best in thyself; and this is of the same kind as that.

All","Remember: philosophy requiresonly what your nature already demands.","These two things be common to the souls, as of God, so of men, and of every reasonable creature, first that in their own proper work hey cannot be hindered by anything: and secondly, that their happiness doth consist in a disposition to, and in the practice of righteousness; and that in these their desire is terminated.","He who is greedy of credit and reputation after his death, doth not consider, that they themselves by whom he is remembered, shall soon after every one of them be dead; and they likewise that succeed those; until at last all memory, which hitherto by the succession of men admiring and soon after dying hath had its course, be quite extinct.","You can discard most of the junk that clutters your mind\u2014things that exist only there\u2014and clear out space for yourself: . . . by comprehending the scale of the world . . . by contemplating infinite time . . . by thinking of the speed with which things change\u2014each part of every thing; the narrow space between our birth and death; the infinite time before; the equally unbounded time that follows.","He who has a vehement desire for posthumous fame does not consider that every one of those who remember him will himself also die very soon; then again also they who have succeeded them, until the whole remembrance shall have been extinguished as it is transmitted through men who foolishly admire and perish. But suppose that those who will remember are even immortal, and that the remembrance will be immortal, what then is this to thee? And I say not what is it to the dead, but what is it to the living? What is praise except indeed so far as it has a certain utility? For thou now rejectest unseasonably the gift of nature, clinging to something else . .","He that knoweth not what the world is, knoweth not where he himself is. And he that knoweth not what the world was made for, cannot possibly know either what are the qualities, or what is the nature of the world.","We are all mere nuggets of incense on the one altar.

And on freeing yourself from all other distractions. Yes, you can\u2014if you do everything as if it were the last thing you were doing in your life, and stop being aimless, stop letting your emotions override what your mind tells you, stop being hypocritical, self-centered, irritable. You see how few things you have to do to live a satisfying and reverent life? If you can manage this, that\u2019s all even the gods can ask of you.","The highest good was the virtuous life. Virtue alone is happiness, and vice is unhappiness. Carrying this theory to its extreme, the Stoic said that there could be no gradations between virtue and vice, though of course each has its special manifestations.","People try to get away from it all\u2014to the country, to the beach, to the mountains. You always wish that you could too. Which is idiotic: you can get away from it anytime you like. By going within. Nowhere you can go is more peaceful\u2014more free of interruptions\u2014than your own soul. Especially if you have other things to rely on. An instant\u2019s recollection and there it is: complete tranquillity. And by tranquillity I mean a kind of harmony. So keep getting away from it all\u2014like that. Renew yourself. But keep it brief and basic.

And you have forgotten this too, that every man\'s mind is a god and has flowed from that source; that nothing is our own property, but even our child, our body, our very soul have come from that source; that all is as thinking makes it so; that each of us lives only the present moment, and the present moment is all we lose.","thereby gain much leisure, and save much trouble, and therefore at every action a man must privately by way of admonition suggest unto himself, What? may not this that now I go about,","For indeed whatsoever proceeds from the gods, deserves respect for their worth and excellency; and whatsoever proceeds from men, as they are our kinsmen, should by us be entertained, with love, always; sometimes, as proceeding from their ignorance, of that which is truly good and bad, (a blindness no less, than that by which we are not able to discern between white and black:) with a kind of pity and compassion also.","Najlep\u0161\xed sp\xf4sob obrany je nepodoba\u0165 sa t\xfdm, \u010do n\xe1m ubli\u017euj\xfa.","A man must not only consider how daily his life wasteth and decreaseth, but this also, that if he live long, he cannot be certain, whether his understanding shall continue so able and sufficient, for either discreet consideration, in matter of businesses; or for contemplation: it being the thing, whereon true knowledge of things both divine and human, doth depend.","That it\u2019s not what they do that bothers us: that\u2019s a problem for their minds, not ours.

But this is altogether a mark of the most common sort of men, for it is in thy power whenever thou shalt choose to retire into thyself. For nowhere, either with more quiet or more freedom from trouble, does a man retire than into his own soul, particularly when he has within him such thoughts that by looking into them he is immediately in perfect tranquillity; and I affirm that tranquillity is nothing else than the good ordering of the mind.","But he that honours a reasonable soul in general, as it is reasonable and naturally sociable, doth little regard anything else: and above all things is careful to preserve his own, in the continual habit and exercise both of reason and sociableness: and thereby doth co-operate with him, of whose nature he doth also participate; God.","with how little he was satisfied, such as lodging, bed, dress, food, servants;","to be grave without affectation: to observe carefully the several dispositions of my friends, not to be offended with idiots, nor unseasonably to set upon those that are carried with the vulgar opinions, with the theorems, and tenets of philosophers: his conversation being an example how a man might accommodate himself to all men and companies; so that though his company were sweeter and more pleasing than any flatterer\'s cogging and fawning; yet was it at the same time most respected and reverenced:","If therefore it be a thing external that causes thy grief, know, that it is not that properly that doth cause it, but thine own conceit and opinion concerning the thing: which thou mayest rid thyself of, when thou wilt.","Use the setback to practice other virtues.","You have embarked, made the voyage, and come to shore; get out. If indeed to another life, there is no want of gods, not even there.

Stop doing that and everything will be fine. Let the part of you that makes that judgment keep quiet even if the body it\u2019s attached to is stabbed or burnt, or stinking with pus, or consumed by cancer. Or to put it another way: It needs to realize that what happens to everyone\u2014bad and good alike\u2014is neither good nor bad. That what happens in every life\u2014lived naturally or not\u2014is neither natural nor unnatural.","At what time soever thou wilt, it is in thy power to retire into thyself, and to be at rest, and free from all businesses.","It never ceases to amaze me: we all love ourselves more than other people, but care more about their opinion than our own. If a god appeared to us\u2014or a wise human being, even\u2014and prohibited us from concealing our thoughts or imagining anything without immediately shouting it out, we wouldn\u2019t make it through a single day.

Or to lose.","Our life is a warfare, and a mere pilgrimage.","The logos gave you the means to see it\u2014that a given person would act a given way\u2014but you paid no attention.

Virtue alone is admirable, virtue is absolutely self-sufficient; the good man needs no help from circumstances, neither sickness nor adversity can harm him; he is a king, a god among men.","What injures the hive injures the bee.","If you work at that which is before you, following right reason seriously, vigorously, calmly, without allowing anything else to distract you, but keeping your divine part pure, as if you should be bound to give it back immediately; if you hold to this, expecting nothing, fearing nothing, but satisfied with your present activity according to nature, and with heroic truth in every word and sound which you speak, you will live happy.

Constantly then give to thyself this retreat, and renew thyself; and let thy principles be brief and fundamental, which, as soon as thou shalt recur to them, will be sufficient to cleanse the soul completely, and to send thee back free from all discontent with the things to which thou returnest.","What\u2019s there to complain about? People\u2019s misbehavior? But take into consideration: that rational beings exist for one another; that doing what\u2019s right sometimes requires patience; that no one does the wrong thing deliberately; and the number of people who have feuded and envied and hated and fought and died and been buried. \xa0\u2026\xa0and keep your mouth shut.","Don\u2019t imagine that something is good for you if, in pursuing it, you must break a promise, harm anyone else, lose self-respect, act hypocritically, or hide in shame.","12.

No one can prevent that. 13. Doctors keep their scalpels and other instruments handy, for emergencies. Keep your philosophy ready too\u2014ready to understand heaven and earth. In everything you do, even the smallest thing, remember the chain that links them. Nothing earthly succeeds by ignoring heaven, nothing heavenly by ignoring the earth. 14. Stop drifting. You\u2019re not going to re-read your Brief Comments, your Deeds of the Ancient Greeks and Romans, the commonplace books you saved for your old age. Sprint for the finish. Write off your hopes, and if your well-being matters to you, be your own savior while you can.","Begin the morning by saying to yourself, I shall meet with the busybody, the ungrateful, arrogant, deceitful, envious, unsocial. All these things happen to them by reason of their ignorance of what is good and evil. But I, who have seen the nature of the good that it is beautiful, and of the bad that it is ugly, and the nature of him who does wrong, that it is akin to me, not only of the same blood or seed, but that it participates in the same intelligence and the same portion of the divinity, I can neither be injured by any of them, for no one can fix on me what is ugly, nor can I be angry with my kinsman, nor hate him. For we are made for cooperation, like feet, like hands, like eyelids, like the rows of the upper and lower teeth. To act against one another then is contrary to nature; and it is acting against one another to be vexed and to turn away.","If you apply yourself to the task before you, following right reason seriously, vigorously, calmly, without allowing anything else to distract you, but keeping your divine part pure, as if you might be bound to give it back immediately; if you hold to this, expecting nothing, fearing nothing, but satisfied with your present activities according to nature, and with heroic truth in every word and sound which you utter, you will live happily.

For as soon as anything hath appeared, and is passed away, another succeeds, and that also will presently out of sight.","And so he will see even the real gaping jaws of wild beasts with no less pleasure than those which painters and sculptors show by imitation; and in an old woman and an old man he will be able to see a certain maturity and comeliness; and the attractive loveliness of young persons he will be able to look on with chaste eyes; and many such things will present themselves, not pleasing to every man, but to him only who has become truly familiar with nature and her works.","This then remains: Remember to retire into this little territory of thy own, and, above all, do not distract or strain thyself, but be free, at look and things as a man, as a human being, as a citizen, as a mortal.","this is not a misfortune but that to bear it like a brave man is good fortune","For all things fade and turn to fable, and quickly too, utter oblivion covers them like sand.","XXVIII. And these your professed politicians, the only true practical philosophers of the world, (as they think of themselves) so full of affected gravity, or such professed lovers of virtue and honesty, what wretches be they in very deed; how vile and contemptible in themselves? O man! what ado doest thou keep?","Men exist for the sake of one another. Teach them then or bear with them.","No difference between here and there: the city that you live in is the world.","Wretched am I, says one, that this has befallen me. Nay, say you, happy I, who, tho\u2019 this has befallen me, can still remain without sorrow, neither broken by the present, nor dreading the future. The like might have befallen any one; but every one could not have remained thus undejected. Why should the event be called a misfortune, rather than this strength of mind a felicity? But, can you call that a misfortune, to a man, which does not frustrate the intention of his nature? Can that frustrate the intention of it, or hinder it to attain its end, which is not contrary to the will or purpose of his nature; What is this will or purpose? Sure you have learned it. Doth this event hinder you to be just, magnanimous, temperate, prudent, cautious of rash assent, free from error, possessed of a sense of honour and modesty, and of true liberty; or from meriting those other characters, which whoever enjoys, hath all his nature requires, as its proper perfection? And then, upon every occasion of sorrow, remember the maxim, that this event is not a misfortune, but the bearing it courageously is a great felicity.","How do we know that Telauges wasn\u2019t a better man than Socrates? It\u2019s not enough to ask whether Socrates\u2019 death was nobler, whether he debated with the sophists more adeptly, whether he showed greater endurance by spending the night out in the cold, and when he was ordered to arrest the man from Salamis decided it was preferable to refuse, and \u201cswaggered about the streets (which one could reasonably doubt). What matters is what kind of soul he had. Whether he was satisfied to treat men with justice and the gods with reverence and didn\u2019t lose his temper unpredictably at evil done by others, didn\u2019t make himself the slave of other people\u2019s ignorance, didn\u2019t treat anything that nature did as abnormal, or put up with it as an unbearable imposition, didn\u2019t put his mind in his body\u2019s keeping.\u201d","Is my understanding sufficient for this or not? If it is sufficient, I use it for the work as an instrument given by the universal nature. But if it is not sufficient, then either I retire from the work and give way to him who is able to do it better,","If you suffer distress because of some external cause, it is not the thing itself that troubles you but your judgement about it, and it is within your power to cancel that judgement at any moment.","A very ridiculous thing it is, that any man should dispense with vice and wickedness in himself, which is in his power to restrain; and should go about to suppress it in others, which is altogether impossible.","Think continually how many physicians have died, after often knitting their foreheads over their patients; how many astrologers after prophesying other men\'s deaths, as though to die were a great matter; how many philosophers after endless debate on death or survival after death; how many paladins after slaying their thousands; how many tyrants after using their power over men\'s lives with monstrous arrogance, as if themselves immortal; how many entire cities have, if I may use the term, died, Helice, Pompeii, Herculaneum, and others innumerable. Run over, too, the many also you know of, one after another. One followed this man\'s funeral and then was himself laid on the bier; another followed him, and all in a little while. This is the whole matter: see always how ephemeral and cheap are the things of man- yesterday, a spot of albumen, tomorrow, ashes or a mummy. Therefore make your passage through this span of time in obedience to Nature and gladly lay down your life, as an olive, when ripe, might fall, blessing her who bare it and grateful to thee which gave it life.","And to have learned how to accept favors from friends without losing your self-respect or appearing ungrateful.","When you are disturbed by events and lose your serenity, quickly return to yourself and don\'t stay upset longer than the experience lasts; for you\'ll have more mastery over your inner harmony by continually returning to it.","First, do not be upset: all things follow the nature of the Whole, and in a little while you will be no one and nowhere, as is true even of Hadrian and Augustus. Next, concentrate on the matter at hand and see it for what it is. Remind yourself of your duty to be a good man and rehearse what man\'s nature demands: then do it straight and unswerving, or say what you best think right. Always, though, in kindness, integrity, and sincerity.","simply and of your own free will, choose the higher and hold fast to that","How strangely men act. They will not praise those who are living at the same time and living with themselves; but to be themselves praised by posterity, by those whom they have never seen or ever will see, this they set much value on. But this is very much the same as if you should be grieved because those who have lived before you did not praise you.","Thou art a little soul bearing about a corpse, as Epictetus used to say (I. C. 19). 42. It is no evil for things to undergo change, and no good for things to subsist in consequence of change. 43. Time is like a river made up of the events which happen, and a violent stream; for as soon as a thing has been seen, it is carried away, and another comes in its place, and this will be carried away too.","And thou wilt give thyself relief if thou doest every act of thy life as if it were the last, laying aside all carelessness and passionate aversion from the commands of reason, and all hypocrisy, and self-love, and discontent with the portion which has been given to thee.","To conclude, always observe how ephemeral and worthless human things are, and what was yesterday a little mucus tomorrow will be a mummy or ashes.","Casting therefore all other things aside,keep thyself to these few, and remember withal that no man properly can be said tolive more than that which is now present, which is but a moment of time. Whatsoeveris besides either is already past, or uncertain.","Consider yourself to be dead, and to have completed your life up to the present time; and now live according to nature the remainder which is allowed you.","X. It is the part of a man endowed with a good understanding faculty, to consider what they themselves are in very deed, from whose bare conceits and voices, honour and credit do proceed: as also what it is to die, and how if a man shall consider this by itself alone, to die, and separate from it in his mind all those things which with it usually represent themselves unto us, he can conceive of it no otherwise, than as of a work of nature, and he that fears any work of nature, is a very child. Now death, it is not only a work of nature, but also conducing to nature.","Keep thyself therefore, truly simple, good, sincere, grave, free from all ostentation, a lover of that which is just, religious, kind, tender-hearted, strong and vigorous to undergo anything that becomes thee.","If thou findest in human life anything better than justice, truth, temperance, fortitude, and, in a word, anything better than thy own mind\'s self-satisfaction in the things which it enables thee to do according to right reason, and in the condition that is assigned to thee without thy own choice; if, I say, thou seest anything better than this, turn to it with all thy soul, and enjoy that which thou hast found to be the best. But if nothing appears to be better than the deity which is planted in thee, which has subjected to itself all thy appetites, and carefully examines all the impressions, and, as Socrates said, has detached itself from the persuasions of sense, and has submitted itself to the gods, and cares for mankind; if thou findest everything else smaller and of less value than this, give place to nothing else, for if thou dost once diverge and incline to it, thou wilt no longer without distraction be able to give the preference to that good thing which is thy proper possession and thy own; for it is not right that anything of any other kind, such as praise from the many, or power, or enjoyment of pleasure, should come into competition with that which is rationally and politically or practically good. All these things, even though they may seem to adapt themselves to the better things in a small degree, obtain the superiority all at once, and carry us away. But do thou, I say, simply and freely choose the better, and hold to it.- But that which is useful is the better.- Well then, if it is useful to thee as a rational being, keep to it; but if it is only useful to thee as an animal, say so, and maintain thy judgement without arrogance: only take care that thou makest the inquiry by a sure method.","In the ring, our opponents can gouge us with their nails or butt us with their heads and leave a bruise, but we don\u2019t denounce them for it or get upset with them or regard them from then on as violent types. We just keep an eye on them after that. Not out of hatred or suspicion. Just keeping a friendly distance. We need to do that in other areas. We need to excuse what our sparring partners do, and just keep our distance\u2014without suspicion or hatred.","They despise one another, yet they flatter one another;they sant to get above another and get they bow down to one another.","It is crazy to want what is impossible. And impossible for the wicked not to do so.","People find pleasure in different ways. I find it in keeping my mind clear. In not turning away from people or the things that happen to them. In accepting and welcoming everything I see.","The substance of the universe is obedient and compliant; and the reason that governs it has in itself no cause for doing evil, for it has no malice, nor does it do evil to anything, nor is anything harmed by it. But all things are made and perfected according to this reason.","Thou hast also forgotten that every man\'s mind partakes of the Deity, and issueth from thence; and that no man can properly call anything his own, no not his son, nor his body, nor his life; for that they all proceed from that One who is the giver of all things:","He who has seen the present has seen everything, that which happened in the most distant past and that which will happen in the future.","When your spirits need a lift, think of the virtues and talents of those around you - one\'s energy, another\'s modesty, the generosity of a third, something else in a fourth. Nothing is so inspiring or uplifting as the sight of these splendid qualities in our friends. Keep them always in mind.","Either pain affects the body (which is the body\u2019s problem) or it affects the soul. But the soul can choose not to be affected, preserving its own serenity, its own tranquillity. All our decisions, urges, desires, aversions lie within. No evil can touch them.","It was my tutor who dissuaded me from patronizing Green or Blue at the races, or Light or Heavy in the ring;","To the gods I am indebted for having good grandfathers, good parents, a good sister, good teachers, good associates, good kinsmen and friends, nearly everything good. Further, I owe it to the gods that I was not hurried into any offence against any of them, though I had a disposition which, if opportunity had offered, might have led me to do something of this kind; but, through their favour, there never was such a concurrence of circumstances as put me to the trial.","Observe constantly that all things take place by change, and accustom thyself to consider that the nature of the Universe loves nothing so much as to change the things which are and to make new things like them. For everything that exists is in a manner the seed of that which will be. But thou art thinking only of seeds which are cast into the earth or into a womb: but this is a very vulgar notion.","You can live here as you expect to live there.","Detente particularmente en cada una de las acciones que haces y preg\xfantate si la muerte es terrible porque te priva de eso.","It is, in other words, not objects and events but the interpretations we place on them that are the problem. Our duty is therefore to exercise stringent control over the faculty of perception, with the aim of protecting our mind from error.","Secondly, neither have I ever seen mine own soul, and yet I respect and honour it. So then for the Gods, by the daily experience that I have of their power and providence towards myself and others, I know certainly that they are, and therefore worship them.","Don\'t live as though you were going to live a myriad years. Fate is hanging over your head; while you have life, while you may, become good.","If our intellectual part is common, the reason also, in respect of which we are rational beings, is common: if this is so, common also is the reason which commands us what to do, and what not to do;","We were made, Marcus tells us over and over, not for ourselves but for others, and our nature is fundamentally unselfish. In our relationships with others we must work for their collective good, while treating them justly and fairly as individuals.","Either a universe with order and purpose or a medley thrown together by chance, but that too has order. Or can there be order of a kind in your inner world, but no order in the Whole, especially as all things are distinguished from one another, yet intermingle, and respond to each other?","No one can keep you from living as your nature requires. Nothing can happen to you that is not required by Nature.","To welcome with affection what is sent by fate.","From Sextus, a benevolent disposition, and the example of a family governed in a fatherly manner, and the idea of living conformably to nature; and gravity without affectation, and to look carefully after the interests of friends, and to tolerate ignorant persons, and those who form opinions without consideration:","Concentrate on what you\u2019re doing, and what you\u2019re doing it with.","When it allows its action and impulse to be without a purpose, to be random and disconnected: even the smallest things ought to be directed toward a goal.","3. People try to get away from it all\u2014to the country, to the beach, to the mountains. You always wish that you could too. Which is idiotic: you can get away from it anytime you like. By going within.","At dawn, when you have trouble getting out of bed, tell yourself: \u201cI have to go to work \u2014 as a human being. What do I have to complain of, if I\u2019m going to do what I was born for \u2014 the things I was brought into the world to do? Or is this what I was created for? To huddle under the blankets and stay warm?","Set aside a certain number of days, during which you shall be content with the scantiest and cheapest fare, with coarse and rough dress, saying to yourself the while: \\"Is this the condition that I feared?","One is a careful distinction between things which are in our power and things which are not. Desire and dislike, opinion and affection, are within the power of the will; whereas health, wealth, honour, and other such are generally not so. The Stoic was called upon to control his desires and affections, and to guide his opinion; to bring his whole being under the sway of the will or leading principle, just as the universe is guided and governed by divine Providence.","Worship the Gods, procure the welfare of men, this life is short. Charitable actions, and a holy disposition, is the only fruit of this earthly life.","Live a good life. If there are gods and they are just, then they will not care how devout you have been, but will welcome you based on the virtues you have lived by. If there are gods, but unjust, then you should not want to worship them. If there are no gods, then you will be gone, but will have lived a noble life that will live on in the memories of your loved ones","Remember what Marcus Aurelius said:\\"Accept the things to which life binds you, and love the people with whom life brings you together, but do so with all your heart.","If you are pained by any external thing, it is not this thing that disturbs you, but your own judgment about it. And it is in your power to wipe out this judgment now. But if anything in your own disposition gives you pain, who hinders you from correcting your opinion? And even if you are pained because you are not doing some particular thing that seems to you to be right, why do you not rather act than complain? \u201cBut some insuperable obstacle is in the way. Do not be grieved then, for the cause of its not being done depends not on you. \u201cBut it is not worthwhile to live if this cannot be done.\u201d Take your departure then from life contentedly, just as he dies who is in full activity, and well pleased, too, with the things that are obstacles.\u201d","From my governor, to be neither of the green nor of the blue party at the games in the Circus, nor a partisan either of the Parmularius or the Scutarius at the gladiators\' fights; from him too I learned endurance of labour, and to want little, and to work with my own hands, and not to meddle with other people\'s affairs, and not to be ready to listen to slander. From","Make for thyself a definition or description of the thing which is presented to thee, so as to see distinctly what kind of a thing it is in its substance, in its nudity, in its complete entirety, and tell thyself its proper name, and the names of the things of which it has been compounded, and into which it will be resolved.","To watch the courses of the stars as if you revolved with them. To keep constantly in mind how the elements alter into one another. Thoughts like this wash off the mud of life below.","Concentrate every minute like a Roman\u2014like a man\u2014on doing what\u2019s in front of you with precise and genuine seriousness, tenderly, willingly, with justice. And on freeing yourself from all other distractions. Yes, you can\u2014if you do everything as if it were the last thing you were doing in your life, and stop being aimless, stop letting your emotions override what your mind tells you, stop being hypocritical, self-centered, irritable.

But","Consider the whole universe whereof thou art but a very little part, and the whole age of the world together, whereof but a short and very momentary portion is allotted unto thee, and all the fates and destinies together, of which how much is it that comes to thy part and share.","God sees the minds (ruling principles) of all men bared of the material vesture and rind and impurities. For with his intellectual part alone he touches the intelligence only which has flowed and been derived from himself into these bodies. And if thou also usest thyself to do this, thou wilt rid thyself of thy much trouble.","Think constantly how many doctors have died, after knitting their brows over their own patients how many astrologers, after predicting the deaths of others, as if death were something important; how many philosophers, after endless deliberation on death or immortality; how many heroes, after the many others they killed; how many tyrants, after using their power over men\u2019s lives with monstrous insolence, as if they themselves were immortal. Think too how many whole cities have died \u2013 Helice, Pompeii, Herculaneum, innumerable others. Go over now all those you have known yourself, one after the other: one man follows a friend\u2019s funeral and is then laid out himself, then another follows him \u2013 and all in a brief space of time. The conclusion of this? You should always look on human life as short and cheap. Yesterday sperm: tomorrow a mummy or ashes.So one should pass through this tiny fragment of time in tune with nature, and leave it gladly, as an olive might fall when ripe, blessing the earth which bore it and grateful to the tree which gave it growth.","You should always be ready to apply these two rules of action, the first, to do nothing other than what the kingly and law-making art ordains for the benefits of humankind, and, the second, to be prepared to change your mind if someone is at hand to put you right and guide you away from some groundless opinion.","Either the gods have power or they don\u2019t. If they don\u2019t,why pray? If they do, then why not pray for something elseinstead of for things to happen or not to happen? Pray not tofeel fear. Or desire, or grief.

What did they gain over the untimely dead?In truth, the distance we have to travel is small: and we drag it out with such labor, in such poor company, in such a feeble body. No great thing, then. Look behind you at the huge gulf of time, and another infinity ahead.

It was the doctrine of Marcus Aurelius that most of the ills of life come to us from our own imagination, that it was not in the power of others seriously to interfere with the calm, temperate life of an individual, and that when a fellow being did anything to us that seemed unjust he was acting in ignorance, and that instead of stirring up anger within us it should stir our pity for him.

Rather, would you not proceed to enumerate the several letters quietly one by one? Well then; remember that here in life every piece of duty is likewise made up of its separate items.

For such as it is to be young and to grow old, and to increase and to reach maturity, and to have teeth and beard and grey hairs, and to beget, and to be pregnant and to bring forth, and all the other natural operations that the seasons of your life bring, such also is dissolution. This, then, is consistent with the character of a reflecting man, to be neither careless nor impatient nor contemptuous with respect to death, but to wait for it as one of the operations of nature.

I have often wondered how it is that every man loves himself more than all the rest of men, but yet sets less value on his own opinion of himself than on the opinion of others. If then a god or a wise teacher should present himself to a man and bid him to think of nothing and to design nothing that he would not express as soon as he conceived it, he could not endure it even for a single day.

To conclude, always observe how ephemeral and worthless human things are, and what was yesterday a little mucus, to-morrow will be a mummy or ashes. Pass then through this little space of time conformably to nature, and end thy journey in content, just as an olive falls off when it is ripe, blessing nature who produced it, and thanking the tree on which it grew.","If thou workest at that which is before thee, following right reason seriously, vigorously, calmly, without allowing anything else to distract thee, but keeping thy divine part pure, as if thou shouldst be bound to give it back immediately; if thou holdest to this, expecting nothing, fearing nothing, but satisfied with thy present activity according to nature, and with heroic truth in every word and sound which thou utterest, thou wilt live happy.","No pointless actions.","If you find something very difficult to achieve yourself, don\u2019t imagine it impossible\u2014for anything possible and proper for another person can be achieved as easily by you.","In short, know this: Human lives are brief and trivial.

And you will immediately make large and wide room for yourself by grasping the whole universe in your thought, contemplating the eternity of time, and reflecting on the rapid change of each thing in every part.How brief the gap from birth to dissolution, how vast the gulf of time before your birth, and an equal infinity after your dissolution.","Why should any of these things that happen externally, so much distract thee?","And that might be applied to him which is recorded of Socrates, that he was able both to abstain from, and to enjoy, those things which many are too weak to abstain from, and cannot enjoy without excess. But to be strong enough both to bear the one and to be sober in the other is the mark of a man who has a perfect and invincible soul, such as he showed in the illness of Maximus.","Every man\'s happiness depends from himself, but behold thy life is almost at an end, whiles affording thyself no respect, thou dost make thy happiness to consist in the souls, and conceits of other men.","For we are made for co-operation, like feet, like hands, like eyelids, like the rows of the upper and lower teeth. To act against one another then is contrary to nature; and it is acting against one another to be vexed and to turn away.","How can I either be hurt by any of those, since it is not in their power to make me incur anything that is truly reproachful?","Do not act as if thou wert going to live ten thousand years.

This then remains: Remember to retire into this little territory of thy own, and above all do not distract or strain thyself, but be free, and look at things as a man, as a human being, as a citizen, as a mortal.","Should not thou rather blame thyself, who, when upon very good grounds of reason, thou mightst have thought it very probable, that such a thing would by such a one be committed, didst not only not foresee it, but moreover dost wonder at it, that such a thing should be.","He who fears death either fears the loss of sensation or a different kind of sensation. But if you shall have no sensation, neither will you feel any harm; and if you shall acquire another kind of sensation, you will be a different kind of living being and you will not cease to live.","Asia and Europe are corners in the Universe; every sea, a drop in the Universe; Mount Athos, a clod of earth in the Universe; every instant of time, a pin-prick of eternity.

For no sooner is each seen, than it has been carried away, and another is being carried by, and that, too, will be carried away.","Est\xe1 cerca que t\xfa te olvides de todo y tambi\xe9n lo est\xe1 que todos te olviden.","How quickly all things disappear, in the universe the bodies themselves, but in time the remembrance of them; what is the nature of all sensible things, and particularly those which attract with the bait of pleasure or terrify by pain, or are noised abroad by vapoury fame; how worthless, and contemptible, and sordid, and perishable, and dead they are\u2014all this it is the part of the intellectual faculty to observe.

Which means: thought and action resulting in the common good. What you were born to do.","Thus there are two reasons why you must be content with what happens to you: first because it was for you it came to pass, for you it was ordered and to you it was related, a thread of destiny stretching back to the most ancient causes; secondly because that which has come to each individually is a cause of the welfare and the completion in very truth of the actual continuance of that which governs the Whole.","the Stoics had always approved of participation in public life, and this stand struck a chord with the Roman aristocracy, whose code of values placed a premium on political and military activity.","Casting aside other things, hold to the precious few; and besides bear in mind that every man lives only the present, which is an indivisible point, and that all the rest of his life is either past or is uncertain.","You have seen those things, look now at these: do not trouble yourself, make yourself simple. Does a man do wrong? He does wrong to himself. Has some chance befallen you? It is well; from Universal Nature, from the beginning, all that befalls was determined for you and the thread was spun. The sum of the matter is this: life is short; the present must be turned to profit with reasonableness and right. Be sober without effort.","So must a good ear, and a good smell be ready for whatsoever is either to be heard, or smelt: and a good stomach as indifferent to all kinds of food, as a millstone is, to whatsoever she was made for to grind. As ready therefore must a sound understanding be for whatsoever shall happen. But he that saith, O that my children might live! and, O that all men might commend me for whatsoever I do! is an eye that seeks after green things; or as teeth, after that which is tender.","All human beings have a share of the logos, and all have roles to play in the vast design that is the world. But this is not to say that all humans are equal or that the roles they are assigned are interchangeable. Marcus, like most of his contemporaries, took it for granted that human society was hierarchical, and this is borne out by the images he uses to describe it. Human society is a single organism, like an individual human body or a tree. But the trunk of the tree is not to be confused with the leaves, or the hands and feet with the head. Our duty to act justly does not mean that we must treat others as our equals; it means that we must treat them as they deserve. And their deserts are determined in part by their position in the hierarchy.","For in those things that properly belongunto the mind, she cannot be hindered by any man","Indeed, the application of the adjective \u201cstoic to a person who shows strength and courage in misfortune probably owes more to the aristocratic Roman value system than it does to Greek philosophers. Stoicism\u201d","Affect not to set out your thoughts with curious neat language. Be neither a great talker, nor a great undertaker; be one who for his word or actions needs neither an oath, nor any man to be a witness.","Use thyself; as often, as thou seest any man do anything, presently (if it be possible) to say unto thyself, What is this man\'s end in this his action? But begin this course with thyself first of all, and diligently examine thyself concerning whatsoever thou doest.","to grumble at anything that happens is a rebellion against Nature, in some part of which are bound up the natures of all other things.","Either teach them better if it be in thy power; or if it be not, remember that forthis use, to bear with them patiently, was mildness and goodness granted unto thee.","where a man can live, there he can also live well. But he must live in a palace;- well then, he can also live well in a palace.","Thou must also take heed of another kind of wandering, for they are idle in their actions, who toil and labour in this life, and have no certain scope to which to direct all their motions, and desires.","The universe, then, is God, of whom the popular gods are manifestations; while legends and myths are allegorical. The soul of man is thus an emanation from the godhead, into whom it will eventually be re-absorbed. The divine ruling principle makes all things work together for good, but for the good of the whole. The highest good of man is consciously to work with God for the common good, and this is the sense in which the Stoic tried to live in accord with nature. In the individual it is virtue alone which enables him to do this; as Providence rules the universe, so virtue in the soul must rule man.","To live a good life: We have the potential for it. If we learn to be indifferent to what makes no difference.","If you are pained by any external thing, it is not this thing that disturbs you, but your own judgement about it. And it is in your power to wipe out this judgement now. But if anything in your own disposition gives you pain, who hinders you from correcting your opinion? And even if you are pained because you are not doing some particular thing that seems to you to be right, why do you not rather act than complain?","Were you to live three thousand years, or even thirty thousand, remember that the sole life which a man can lose is that which he is living at the moment; and furthermore, that he can have no other life except the one he loses. This means that the longest life and the shortest amount to the same thing. For the passing minute is every man\u2019s equal possession, but what has once gone by is not ours.","that there is a limit to the time assigned you, and if you don\u2019t use it to free yourself it will be gone and will never return.","A man should always have these two rules in readiness; the one, to do only whatever the reason of the ruling and legislating faculty may suggest for the use of men; the other, to change thy opinion, if there is any one at hand who sets thee right and moves thee from any opinion. But this change of opinion must proceed only from a certain persuasion, as of what is just or of common advantage, and the like, not because it appears pleasant or brings reputation. Hast","Of the life of man the duration is but a point, its substance streaming away, its perception dim, the fabric of the entire body prone to decay, and the soul a vortex, and fortune incalculable, and fame uncertain.

The Stoic was called upon to control his desires and affections, and to guide his opinion;","That which does not make a man worse than he was, also does not make his life worse, nor does it harm him either from without or from within.","Wherein Antoninus recordeth, What and of whom, whether Parents, Friends, or Masters; by their good examples, or good advice and counsel, he had learned:","Lucilla saw Verus die, and then Lucilla died. Secunda saw Maximus die, and then Secunda died. Epitynchanus saw Diotimus die, and Epitynchanus died. Antoninus saw Faustina die, and then Antoninus died. Such is everything. Celer saw Hadrian die, and then Celer died. And those sharp-witted men, either seers or men inflated with pride, where are they? For instance the sharp-witted men, Charax and Demetrius the Platonist and Eudaemon, and any one else like them. All ephemeral, dead long ago. Some indeed have not been remembered even for a short time, and others have become the heroes of fables, and again others have disappeared even from fables. Remember this then, that this little compound, thyself, must either be dissolved, or thy poor breath must be extinguished, or be removed and placed elsewhere.","Awaken; return to yourself. Now, no longer asleep, knowing they were only dreams, clear-headed again, treat everything around you as a dream.","Take away thy opinion, and then there is taken away the complaint, \u201cI have been harmed. Take away the complaint, \u201cI have been harmed,\u201d and the harm is taken away.\u201d","Consider that everything which happens, happens justly, and if thou observest carefully, thou wilt find it to be so. I do not say only with respect to the continuity of the series of things, but with respect to what is just, and as if it were done by one who assigns to each thing its value. Observe then as thou hast begun; and whatever thou doest, do it in conjunction with this, the being good, and in the sense in which a man is properly understood to be good. Keep to this in every action.","25. Try how the life of the good man suits thee, the life of him who is satisfied with his portion out of the whole, and satisfied with his own just acts and benevolent disposition.","Nothing is as encouraging as when virtues are visibly embodied in the people around us, when we\u2019re practically showered with them.","he may not be profound, he is always sincere.","Practice even what seems impossible.","Man, what are you talking about? Me in chains? You may fetter my leg but my will, not even Zeus himself can overpower.","hold every hour in your grasp. Lay hold of to-day\'s task, and you will not need to depend so much upon to-morrow\'s. While we are postponing, life speeds by. Nothing, Lucilius, is ours, except time. We were entrusted by nature with the ownership of this single thing, so fleeting and slippery that anyone who will can oust us from possession. What fools these mortals be! They allow the cheapest and most useless things, which can easily be replaced, to be charged in the reckoning, after they have acquired them; but they never regard themselves as in debt when they have received some of that precious commodity, \u2013 time! And yet time is the one loan which even a grateful recipient cannot repay.","And thou wilt give thyself relief, if thou doest every act of thy life as if it were the last, laying aside all carelessness and passionate aversion from the commands of reason, and all hypocrisy, and self-love, and discontent with the portion which has been given to thee.","It should be a man\'s task, says the Imitation, \'to overcome himself, and every day to be stronger than himself.","And thou wilt give thyself relief, if thou doest every act of thy life as if it were the last,","Choose not to be harmed\u2014and you won\u2019t feel harmed.","What is evil to thee does not subsist in the ruling principle of another; nor yet in any turning and mutation of thy corporeal covering. Where is it then? It is in that part of thee in which subsists the power of forming opinions about evils. Let this power then not form such opinions, and all is well. And if that which is nearest to it, the poor body, is burnt, filled with matter and rottenness, nevertheless let the part which forms opinions about these things be quiet, that is, let it judge that nothing is either bad or good which can happen equally to the bad man and the good. For that which happens equally to him who lives contrary to nature and to him who lives according to nature, is neither according to nature nor contrary to nature.","in an old woman and an old man he will be able to see a certain maturity and comeliness; and the attractive loveliness of young persons he will be able to look on with chaste eyes; and many such things will present themselves, not pleasing to every man, but to him only who has become truly familiar with nature and her works.","It is royal to do good and to be abused.","vex not thy spirit at the course of things,they not heed thy vexations.","A prudent governor will not roughly oppose even the superstitions of his people; and though he may wish that they were wiser, he will know that he cannot make them so by offending their prejudices.","Let the god that is within you be the champion of the being you are.","Even chance is not divorced from nature, from the inweaving and and enfolding of things governed by Providence.","Then consider the Middle (and later the New) Comedy and what it aimed at\u2014gradually degenerating into mere realism and empty technique.","It is no evil for things to undergo change, and no good for things to subsist in consequence of change.","This thou must always bear in mind, what is the nature of the whole, and what is my nature, and how this is related to that, and what kind of a part it is of what kind of a whole; and that there is no one who hinders thee from always doing and saying the things which are according to the nature of which thou art a part.","be not either a man of many words, or busy about too many things.","To live a good life: We have the potential for it. If we can learn to be indifferent to what makes no difference.","First, that all things in the world from all eternity, by a perpetual revolution of the same times and things ever continued and renewed, are of one kind and nature; so that whether for a hundred or two hundred years only, or for an infinite space of time, a man see those things which are still the same, it can be no matter of great moment. And secondly, that that life which any the longest liver, or the shortest liver parts with, is for length and duration the very same, for that only which is present, is that, which either of them can lose, as being that only which they have; for that which he hath not, no man can truly be said to lose.","That I was not long brought up by the concubine of my father; that I preserved the flower of my youth. That I took not upon me to be a man before my time, but rather put it off longer than I needed. That I lived under the government of my lord and father, who would take away from me all pride and vainglory, and reduce me to that conceit and opinion that it was not impossible for a prince to live in the court without a troop of guards and followers, extraordinary apparel, such and such torches and statues, and other like particulars of state and magnificence; but that a man may reduce and contract himself almost to the state of a private man, and yet for all that not to become the more base and remiss in those public matters and affairs, wherein power and authority is requisite.","Keep reminding yourself of the way things are connected, of their relatedness. All things are implicated in one another and in sympathy with each other. This event is the consequence of some other one. Things push and pull on each other, and breathe together, and are one. The things ordained for you -- teach yourself to be at one with those. And the people who share them with you -- treat them with love. With real love.","Do, soul, do; abuse and contemn thyself; yet a while and the time for thee to respect thyself, will be at an end. Every man\'s happiness depends from himself, but behold thy life is almost at an end, whiles affording thyself no respect, thou dost make thy happiness to consist in the souls, and conceits of other men.","For nowhere, either with more quiet or more freedom from trouble, does a man retire than into his own soul, particularly when he has within him such thoughts that by looking into them he is immediately in perfect tranquillity; and I affirm that tranquillity is nothing else than the good ordering of the mind.","Do you have reason? I have. Why then do you not use it? For if reason does its own work, what else could you wish for?","all things soon pass away and become a mere tale, and complete oblivion soon buries them. And I say this of those who have shone in a wondrous way.","6. Yes, keep on degrading yourself, soul. But soon your chance at dignity will be gone. Everyone gets one life. Yours is almost used up, and instead of treating yourself with respect, you have entrusted your own happiness to the souls of others.","Virtue alone is happiness, and vice is unhappiness.","Life is a pilgrimage and a struggle. All we have of time is a moment; the universe is in constant flux; our bodies are fragile; our senses grasp so little; our souls are a mist; the future is a fog; and fame is fleeting.","Take pleasure in one thing and rest in it, in passing from one social act to another social act, thinking of God.","Never esteem aught of advantage which will oblige you to break your faith, or to desert your honour; to hate, to suspect, or to execrate any man; to play a part; or to set your mind on anything that needs to be hidden by wall or curtain. He who to all things prefers the soul, the divinity within him, and the sacred cult of its virtues, makes no tragic groan or gesture. He needs neither solitude nor a crowd of spectators; and, best of all, he will live neither seeking nor shunning death. Whether the soul shall use its surrounding body for a longer or shorter space is to him indifferent. Were he to depart this moment he would go as readily as he would do any other seemly and proper action, holding one thing only in life-long avoidance\u2014to find his soul in any case unbefitting an intelligent social being.","Remember how long you\u2019ve been putting this off\u2026At some point you have to recognize what world it is that you belong to; what power rules it and from what source you spring; that there is a limit to the time assigned you, and if you don\u2019t use it to free yourself it will be gone and will never return.","every man lives the present time only, and loses only this.","But fortunate means that a man has assigned to himself a good fortune: and a good fortune is good disposition of the soul, good emotions, good actions.","Begin the morning by saying to thyself, I shall meet with the busy-body, the ungrateful, arrogant, deceitful, envious, unsocial. All these things happen to them by reason of their ignorance of what is good and evil.","Think of thy last hour.

For this if thou shalt call to mind, thou shalt soon forget thine anger; especially when at the same time this also shall concur in thy thoughts, that he was constrained by his error and ignorance so to do: for how can he choose as long as he is of that opinion? Do thou therefore if thou canst, take away that from him, that forceth him to do as he doth.","Let there be freedom from perturbations with respect to the things which come from the external cause; and let there be justice in the things done by virtue of the internal cause, that is, let there be movement and action terminating in this, in social acts, for this is according to thy nature.

For it is not attracted toward one kind of material thing or event but adapts itself to all internal and external limitations, whether those limitations are due to ability or fate. Nevertheless, it converts into usable fuel anything that opposes it, just as fire does when it consumes what is thrown upon it, by which a small fire would have been extinguished.

To be like the rock that the waves keep crashing over. It stands unmoved and the raging of the sea falls still around it. 49a.","Occupy yourself with few things, says the philosopher, if you would be tranquil. But consider if it would not be better to say, Do what is necessary, and whatever the reason of a social animal naturally requires, and as it requires. For this brings not only the tranquillity that comes from doing well, but also that which comes from doing few things. Since the greatest part of what we say and do is unnecessary, dispensing with such activities affords a man more leisure and less uneasiness. Accordingly on every occasion a man should ask himself, Is this one of the unnecessary things? Now a man should take away not only unnecessary acts, but also unnecessary thoughts so that superfluous acts will not follow after.","Someone despises me. That\u2019s their problem. Mine: not to do or say anything despicable. Someone hates me. Their problem. Mine: to be patient and cheerful with everyone, including them. Ready to show them their mistake. Not spitefully, or to show off my own self-control, but in an honest, upright way. Like Phocion (if he wasn\u2019t just pretending). That\u2019s what we should be like inside, and never let the gods catch us feeling anger or resentment. As long as you do what\u2019s proper to your nature, and accept what the world\u2019s nature has in store\u2014as long as you work for others\u2019 good, by any and all means\u2014what is there that can harm you?","All that you pray to reach at some point in the circuit of your life can be yours now - if you are generous to yourself. That is, if you leave all the past behind, entrust the future to Providence,and direct the present solely to reverence and justice. To reverence, so that you come to love your given lot: it was Nature that brought it to you and you to it. To justice, so that you are open and direct in word and action, speaking the truth, observing law and proportion in all you do. You should let nothing stand in your way - not the iniquity of others, not what anyone else thinks or says, still less any sensation of this poor flesh that has accreted round you: the afflicted part must see to its own concern. If, then, when you finally come close to your exit, you have left all else behind and value only your directing mind and the divinity within you, if your fear is not that you will cease to live, but that you never started a life in accordance with nature, then you will be a man worthy of the universe that gave you birth. You will no longer be a stranger in your own country, no longer meet the day\'s events as if bemused by the unexpected, no longer hang on this or that.","So keep this refuge in mind: the back roads of your self. Above all, no strain and no stress. Be straightforward. Look at things like a man, like a human being, like a citizen, like a mortal. And among the things you turn to, these two: i. That things have no hold on the soul. They stand there unmoving, outside it. Disturbance comes only from within\u2014from our own perceptions. ii. That everything you see will soon alter and cease to exist. Think of how many changes you\u2019ve already seen. \u201cThe world is nothing but change. Our life is only perception","Then remind yourself that past and future have no power over you. Only the present\u2014and even that can be minimized. Just mark off its limits. And if your mind tries to claim that it can\u2019t hold out against that . . . well, then, heap shame upon it.","If you seek tranquillity, do less.","No te distraigan los incidentes exteriores. Desoc\xfapate para aprender algo m\xe1s de bueno, y cesa de andar girando como una devanadera. Conviene asimismo precaverte de otra clase de extrav\xedo.

So remember this principle when something threatens to cause you pain: the thing itself was no misfortune at all; to endure it and prevail is great good fortune.","Remember too on every occasion which leads thee to vexation to apply this principle: not that this is a misfortune, but that to bear it nobly is good fortune.","Of my grandfather Verus I have learned to be gentle and meek, and to refrain from all anger and passion.","I am made up of substance and what animates it, and neither one can ever stop existing, any more than it began to.

Just as much reason hast thou to grieve that thou must live but so many years, and not longer. For as for bulk and substance thou dost content thyself with that proportion of it that is allotted unto thee, so shouldst thou for time.","Two characteristics shared by gods and men (and every rational creature): i.

Such a fountain, where springing waters can never fail, so thou dig still deeper and deeper.","So this is how a thoughtful person should await death: not with indifference, not with impatience, not with disdain, but simply viewing it as one of the things that happen to us. Now you anticipate the child\u2019s emergence from its mother\u2019s womb; that\u2019s how you should await the hour when your soul will emerge from its compartment.","26. You\u2019ve seen that. Now look at this. Don\u2019t be disturbed. Uncomplicate yourself. Someone has done wrong \u2026 to himself. Something happens to you. Good.

It will make no difference.","What then is that which is able to conduct a man? One thing and only one, philosophy. But this consists in keeping the daemon within a man free from violence and unharmed, superior to pains and pleasures, doing nothing without purpose, nor yet falsely and with hypocrisy, not feeling the need of another man\u2019s doing or not doing anything; and besides, accepting all that happens, and all that is allotted, as coming from thence, wherever it is, from whence he himself came; and, finally, waiting for death with a cheerful mind, as being nothing else than a dissolution of the elements of which every living being is compounded. But if there is no harm to the elements themselves in each continually changing into another, why should a man have any apprehension about the change and dissolution of all the elements? For it is according to nature, and nothing is evil which is according to nature.","Por lo dem\xe1s, todo lo que es bello en cierto modo, bello es por s\xed mismo, y termina en s\xed m\xedsmo sin considerar el elogio como parte de s\xed mismo.

But this readiness of it, it must proceed, not from an obstinate and peremptory resolution of the mind, violently and passionately set upon Opposition, as Christians are wont; but from a peculiar judgment; with discretion and gravity, so that others may be persuaded also and drawn to the like example, but without any noise and passionate exclamations.","What a subject, and what a course of life is it, that thou doest so much desire to be rid of. For all these things, what are they, but fit objects for an understanding, that beholdeth everything according to its true nature, to exercise itself upon? Be patient, therefore, until that (as a strong stomach that turns all things into his own nature; and as a great fire that turneth in flame and light, whatsoever thou doest cast into it) thou have made these things also familiar, and as it were natural unto thee.","In sum, remember this, that within a very little while, both thou and he shall both be dead, and after a little while more, not so much as your names and memories shall be remaining.","Fancy not to thyself things future, as though they were present but of those that are present, take some aside, that thou takest most benefit of, and consider of them particularly, how wonderfully thou wouldst want them, if they were not present.","Give what thou wilt, and take away what thou wilt, saith he that is well taughtand truly modest, to Him that gives, and takes away.

Right thoughts, beneficial actions, honest speech, and a cheerful disposition. These things are in harmony with, and flow from, the eternal Source of all.","The duration of a person\u2019s life is only a moment; our substance is flowing away this very moment; the senses are dim; the composition of the body is decaying, the soul is chaos, our fate is unknowable, and reputation uncertain. In a word all bodily things are like a flowing river, and everything of the soul is dream and smoke, and life is all warfare and a stranger\u2019s wanderings, and the reward is oblivion. What then could possibly guide us? Only one thing: Philosophy.","No longer talk at all about the kind of man that a good man ought to be, but be such.","21.

It\u2019s the truth I\u2019m after, and the truth never harmed anyone. What harms us is to persist in self-deceit and ignorance.","29. To erase false perceptions, tell yourself: I have it in me to keep my soul from evil, lust and all confusion. To see things as they are and treat them as they deserve. Don\u2019t overlook this innate ability.","concerned with the act more than with the intent.","Let it not be in any man\'s power, to say truly of thee, that thou art not truly simple, or sincere and open, or not good. Let him be deceived whosoever he be that shall have any such opinion of thee. For all this doth depend of thee. For who is it that should hinder thee from being either truly simple or good? Do thou only resolve rather not to live, than not to be such.","26. If someone asked you how to write your name, would you clench your teeth and spit out the letters one by one? If he lost his temper, would you lose yours as well? Or would you just spell out the individual letters? Remember\u2014your responsibilities can be broken down into individual parts as well.

To accept it without arrogance, to let it go with indifference.","We\u2019re all human beings. Why hate anyone, flatter anyone, lord over anyone, or bow before anyone?","Everywhere, at each moment, you have the option: to accept this event with humility to treat this person as he should be treated to approach this thought with care, so that nothing irrational creeps in.","But Marcus Aurelius knows that what the heart is full of, the man will do.","For whatsoever it be, it is in thy power either to do it, or to say it, and therefore seek not any pretences, as though thou wert hindered.","No hay que irritarse con las cosas, pues a ellas nada\\tles importa","Whatever is beautiful at all is beautiful in itself. Its beauty ends there, and praise has no part in it. Nothing is the better or the worse for being praised; and this holds also of what is beautiful in the common estimation: of material forms and works of art. Thus true beauty needs nothing beyond itself, any more than law, or truth, or kindness, or honour. For none of these gets a single grace from praise or one blot from censure. Does the emerald lose its virtue if one praise it not? Can one by scanting praise depreciate gold, ivory, or purple, a lyre or a dagger, a flower or a shrub?","the main thing we were made for is to work with others. Secondly, to resist our body\u2019s urges. Because things driven by logos\u2014by thought\u2014have the capacity for detachment\u2014to resist impulses and sensations, both of which are merely corporeal. Thought seeks to be their master, not their subject.","my soul, the time I trust will be, when thou shalt be good, simple, single, more open and visible, than that body by which it is enclosed. Thou wilt one day be sensible of their happiness, whose end is love, and their affections dead to all worldly things. Thou shalt one day be full, and in want of no external thing: not seeking pleasure from anything, either living or insensible,","Nothing that goes on in anyone else\u2019s mind can harm you. Nor can the shifts and changes in the world around you. \u2014Then where is harm to be found? In your capacity to see it.","Mancher, der jemandem eine Gef\xe4lligkeit erwiesen hat, ist sogleich beider Hand, sie ihm in Rechnung zu stellen; ein anderer ist zwar dazu nicht sogleich bereit, denkt sich aber doch denselben in anderer Hinsicht als seinen Schuldner und hat den geleisteten Dienst immer in Gedanken. Ein dritter dagegen wei\xdf gewisserma\xdfen nicht einmal, was er geleistet hat; er ist dem Weinstocke gleich, der Trauben tr\xe4gt und nichts weiter will, zufrieden, da\xdf er seine Frucht gegeben hat.

Death. The end of sense-perception, of being controlled by our emotions, of mental activity, of enslavement to our bodies.","Speak what you really think, not what you think people want to hear.","Shall I do it?

It is against himself that he doth offend: why should it trouble thee?\' The offender needs pity, not wrath; those who must needs be corrected, should be treated with tact and gentleness; and one must be always ready to learn better. \'The best kind of revenge is, not to become like unto them.","Nothing will stand in the way of thy acting justly and soberly and considerately.","8. Epithets for yourself: Upright. Modest. Straightforward. Sane. Cooperative. Disinterested. Try not to exchange them for others. And if you should forfeit them, set about getting them back. Keep in mind that \u201csanity means understanding things\u2014each individual thing\u2014for what they are. And not losing the thread. And \u201ccooperation\u201d means accepting what nature assigns you\u2014accepting it willingly. And \u201cdisinterest\u201d means that the intelligence should rise above the movements of the flesh\u2014the rough and the smooth alike. Should rise above fame, above death, and everything like them. If you maintain your claim to these epithets\u2014without caring if others apply them to you or not\u2014you\u2019ll become a new person, living a new life. To keep on being the person that you\u2019ve been\u2014to keep being mauled and degraded by the life you\u2019re living\u2014is to be devoid of sense and much too fond of life. Like those animal fighters at the games\u2014torn half to pieces, covered in blood and gore, and still pleading to be held over till tomorrow\xa0\u2026\xa0to be bitten and clawed again. Set sail, then, with this handful of epithets to guide you. And steer a steady course, if you can. Like an emigrant to the islands of the blest. And if you feel yourself adrift\u2014as if you\u2019ve lost control\u2014then hope for the best, and put in somewhere where you can regain it. Or leave life altogether, not in anger, but matter-of-factly, straightforwardly, without arrogance, in the knowledge that you\u2019ve at least done that much with your life. And as you try to keep these epithets in mind, it will help you a great deal to keep the gods in mind as well. What they want is not flattery, but for rational things to be like them. For figs to do what figs were meant to do\u2014and dogs, and bees\xa0\u2026\xa0and people.\u201d","Use thyself even unto those things that thou doest at first despair of. For the left hand we see, which for the most part hieth idle because not used; yet doth it hold the bridle with more strength than the right, because it hath been used unto it.","Every moment think steadily as a Roman and a man to do what thou hast in hand with perfect and simple dignity, and feeling of affection, and freedom, and justice; and to give thyself relief from all other thoughts. And thou wilt give thyself relief, if thou doest every act of thy life as if it were the last, laying aside all carelessness and passionate aversion from the commands of reason, and all hypocrisy, and self-love, and discontent with the portion which has been given to thee. Thou seest how few the things are, the which if a man lays hold of, he is able to live a life which flows in quiet, and is like the existence of the gods; for the gods on their part will require nothing more from him who observes these things.","Say this to yourself in the morning: Today I shall have to do with meddlers, with the ungrateful, with the insolent, with the crafty, with the envious and the selfish.","the term of your time is circumscribed, and that unless you use it to attain calm of mind, time will be gone and you will be gone and the opportunity to use it will not be yours again.","Mrk pogled na licu protivan je prirodi, a kad postane uobi\u010dajenim, izra\u017eajnost po\u010dinje umirati ili je ve\u0107 kona\u010dno ugasla i ne mo\u017ee je se vi\u0161e u\u017egati.

Consider wether you should not rather blame yourself because you did not expect such a man to err in such a way, for you had the means given you by your reason to suppose that it was likely that he would commit this error, and yet you forgotten and are amazed that he is erred. But most of all, when you blame a man as faithless or ungrateful, turn to yourself, for the fault is manifestly your own, either you did trust that a man who had such a disposition would keep his promise or when conferring your kindness, you did not confer it absolutely, nor yet in such a way as to have received from your very act all the profit.","Remember, that to change thy mind upon occasion, and to follow him that is able to rectify thee, is equally ingenuous, as to find out at the first, what is right and just, without help.

When a loaf of bread, for instance, is in the oven, the cracks appear in it here and there; and these flaws, though not intended in the baking, have a rightness of their own, and sharpen the appetite. Figs, again, at their ripest will crack open. When olives are on the verge of falling, the very imminence of decay adds its peculiar beauty to the fruit. So, too, the dropping head of a cornstalk, the wrinkling skin when a lion scowls, the drip of foam from a wild boar\'s jaws, and many more such sights, are far from beautiful if looked at by themselves; yet as the consequence of some other process of Nature, they make their own contribution to its charm and attractiveness.","Death is relief from reaction to the senses, from the puppet strings of impulse, from the analytical mind, and from service to the flesh.","Write off your hopes, and if your well-being matters to you, be your own savior while you can.","We were born to work together like feet, hands, and eyes, like the two rows of teeth, upper and lower.

The soul of man is thus an emanation from the godhead, into whom it will eventually be re-absorbed. The divine ruling principle makes all things work together for good, but for the good of the whole.

Why then am I dissatisfied if I am going to do the things for which I exist and for which I was brought into the world? Or have I been made for this, to lie under the blankets and keep myself warm? But this is more pleasant. Do you exist then to take your pleasure, and not and not at all for action and exertion? Do you not see the little plants, the little birds, the ants, the spiders, the bees working together to put in order their separate parts of the universe? And are you unwilling to do the work of a human being, and do you not make haste to do that which is according to your nature? But it is necessary to take rest also. It is necessary: nature, however has fixed bounds to this, too: she has fixed bounds both to eating and drinking, and yet in your you go beyond these bounds, beyond what is sufficient; yet in your acts it is not so, but you stop short of what you can do. So you do not love yourself, for if you did, you would love your nature and her will. but those who love their several arts exhaust themselves in working at them unwashed and without food; but you value your own nature less than the engraver values the engraving art, or the dancer the dancing art, or the lover of money values his money, or the vainglorious man his little glory.

Be sure you are neglecting other work if you busy yourself with what such a one is doing and why, with what he is saying, thinking, or scheming. All such things do but divert you from the steadfast guardianship of your own soul. It behoves you, then, in every train of thought to shun all that is aimless or useless, and, above all, everything officious or malignant. Accustom yourself so, and only so, to think, that, if any one were suddenly to ask you, Of what are you thinking-now? you could answer frankly and at once, Of so and so. Then it will plainly appear that you are all simplicity and kindliness, as befits a social being who takes little thought for enjoyment or any phantom pleasure; who spurns contentiousness, envy, or suspicion; or any passion the harbouring of which one would blush to own. For such a man, who has finally determined to be henceforth among the best, is, as it were, a priest and minister of the Gods, using the spirit within him, which preserves a man unspotted from pleasure, unwounded by any pain, inaccessible to all insult, innocent of all evil; a champion in the noblest of all contests\u2014the contest for victory over every passion. He is penetrated with justice; he welcomes with all his heart whatever befalls, or is appointed by Providence. He troubles not often, or ever without pressing public need, to consider what another may say, or do, or design. Solely intent upon his own conduct, ever mindful of his own concurrent part in the destiny of the Universe, he orders his conduct well, persuaded that his part is good. For the lot appointed to every man is part of the law of all things as well as a law for him. He forgets not that all rational beings are akin, and that the love of all mankind is part of the nature of man; also that we must not think as all men think, but only as those who live a life accordant with nature. As for those who live otherwise, he remembers always how they act at home and abroad, by night and by day, and how and with whom they are found in company. And so he cannot esteem the praise of such, for they enjoy not their own approbation.","27. How cruel\u2014to forbid people to want what they think is good for them.

However, we do regard him with a wary eye; not in enmity or suspicion, yet good-temperedly keeping our distance. So let it be, too, at other times in life; let us agree to overlook a great many things in those who are, as it were, our fellow-contestants.

And why then should I be angry? or do I think that error and false opinion is less powerful to make men transgress, than either choler, being immoderate and excessive, to cause the jaundice; or poison, to cause rage?","\xbfQu\xe9 hay, pues, que nos pueda llevar a salvamento?

There have to be shameless people in the world. This is one of them. The same for someone vicious or untrustworthy, or with any other defect. Remembering that the whole class has to exist will make you more tolerant of its members. Another useful point to bear in mind: What qualities has nature given us to counter that defect? As an antidote to unkindness it gave us kindness.

Or if thou do, return unto them again with all possible speed. And remember, that the word emfrwn notes unto thee an intent and intelligent consideration of every object that presents itself unto thee, without distraction. And the word emfrwn a ready and contented acceptation of whatsoever by the appointment of the common nature, happens unto thee. And the word sumfrwn, a super-extension, or a transcendent, and outreaching disposition of thy mind,","If it is not right, do not do it: if it is not true, do not say it. For let thy efforts beIn everything always observe what the thing is which produces for thee an appearance,","Contempla il corso degli astri52 immaginando di ruotare con loro e pensa come gli elementi si trasformano continuamente gli uni negli altri. Il pensiero di queste cose, infatti, purifica dalle brutture della vita terrena.","Soon you\u2019ll be ashes, or bones. A mere name, at most\u2014and even that is just a sound, an echo. The things we want in life are empty, stale, and trivial. Dogs snarling at each other. Quarreling children\u2014laughing and then bursting into tears a moment later.

Examine cada um dos seus atos, separadamente, e pergunte a si mesmo se a morte deve ser temida por lhe privar de tal a\xe7\xe3o.","both thou thyself shalt become a new man, and thou shalt begin a new life.","18. Nothing happens to anyone that he can\u2019t endure.

Go away, I entreat thee by the gods, as thou didst come, for I want thee not. But thou art come according to thy old fashion. I am not angry with thee: only go away.","Think not so much of what thou hast not as of what thou hast: but of the things which thou hast select the best, and then reflect how eagerly they would have been sought, if thou hadst them not.","The Stoics regarded speculation as a means to an end and that end was, as Zeno put it, to live consistently or as it was later explained, to live in conformity with nature.","S\xe9 libre y examina todas las cosas como var\xf3n fuerte, como hombre racional, como ciudadano, como quien vive para morir.

When you wake up in the morning, tell yourself: The people I deal with today will be meddling, ungrateful, arrogant, dishonest, jealous, and surly. They are like this because they can\u2019t tell good from evil. But I have seen the beauty of good, and the ugliness of evil, and have recognized that the wrongdoer has a nature related to my own\u2014not of the same blood or birth, but the same mind, and possessing a share of the divine. And so none of them can hurt me. No one can implicate me in ugliness. Nor can I feel angry at my relative, or hate him. We were born to work together like feet, hands, and eyes, like the two rows of teeth, upper and lower. To obstruct each other is unnatural. To feel anger at someone, to turn your back on him: these are obstructions.","Asia and Europe are corners of the universe; all the sea a drop in the universe; Athos a little clod of the universe; all present time is a point in eternity. All things are little, changeable, perishable.- Chapter VI, Verse 36","Every moment think steadily as a Roman and a man to do what thou hast in hand with perfect and simple dignity, and feeling of affection, and freedom, and justice; and to give thyself relief from all other thoughts. And thou wilt give thyself relief, if thou doest every act of thy life as if it were the last, laying aside all carelessness and passionate aversion from the commands of reason, and all hypocrisy, and self-love, and discontent with the portion which has been given to thee. Thou seest how few the things are, the which if a man lays hold of, he is able to live a life which flows in quiet, and is like the existence of the gods; for the gods on their part will require nothing more from him who observes these things. Do wrong to thyself, do wrong to thyself, my soul; but thou wilt no longer have the opportunity of honouring thyself. Every man\'s life is sufficient. But thine is nearly finished, though thy soul reverences not itself but places thy felicity in the souls of others.","You have to assemble you life yourself - action by action. And be satisfied if each one achieves its goal, as far as it can. No one can keep that from happening.","Whatsoever doth happen in the ordinary course and consequence of natural events, neither the Gods, (for it is not possible, that they either wittingly or unwittingly should do anything amiss) nor men, (for it is through ignorance, and therefore against their wills that they do anything amiss) must be accused. None then must be accused.","Self-harm, my soul, you are doing self-harm: and you will have no more opportunity for self-respect.","It is peculiar to man to love even those who do wrong. And this happens, if when they do wrong it occurs to thee that they are kinsmen, and that they do wrong through ignorance and unintentionally, and that soon both of you will die; and above all, that the wrong-doer has done thee no harm, for he has not made thy ruling faculty worse than it was before.","For to continue such as hitherto thou hast been, to undergo those distractions and distempers as thou must needs for such a life as hitherto thou hast lived, is the part of one that is very foolish, and is overfond of his life.","He therefore that forsakes the law, is a fugitive. So is he, whosoever he be, that is either sorry, angry, or afraid,",".. how worthless are all these poor people who are engaged in matters political, and, as they suppose, are playing the philosopher. All drivelers.Well then, man: do what Nature now requires. Set yourself in motion, if it is in your power, and do not look about to see if anyone will observe it, nor expect Plato\'s Republic: but be content if the smallest thing goes on well, and consider such an event to be no small matter."]')}}]);
