A lamp can never light another lamp unless it continues to burn its own flame. The teacher who has come to the end of his subject, who has no living traffic with his knowledge but merely repeats his lesson to his students, can only load their minds, he cannot quicken them.","The highest education is that which does not merely give us information but makes our life in harmony with all existence.","Go not to the temple to put flowers upon the feet of God, first fill your own house with the fragrance of love. Go not to the temple to light candles before the altar of God, first remove the darkness of sin from your heart. Go not to the temple to bow down your head in prayer, first learn to bow in humility before your fellow men. Go not to the temple to pray on bended knees, first bend down to lift someone who is down trodden. Go not to the temple to ask for forgiveness for your sins, first forgive from your heart those who have sinned against you.","The most important lesson that man can learn from life, is not that there is pain in this world, but that it is possible for him to transmute it into joy.","Beauty is simply reality seen with the eyes of love","I slept and dreamt that life was joy. I awoke and saw that life was service. I acted and behold, service was joy.","If you cry because the sun has gone out of your life, your tears will prevent you from seeing the stars.","Reach high, for stars lie hidden in you. Dream deep, for every dream precedes the goal.","... let us unite, not in spite of our differences, but through them. For differences can never be wiped away, and life would be so much the poorer without them. Let all human races keep their own personalities, and yet come together, not in a uniformity that is dead, but in a unity that is living.","A lamp can only light another lamp when it continues to burn in its own flame.","The main object of teaching is not to give explanations, but to knock at the doors of the mind.","We cross infinity with every step; we meet eternity in every second.","The roots below the earth claim no rewards for making the branches fruitful.","You can\'t cross the sea merely by standing and staring at the water.","The problem is not how to wipe out all differences, but how to unite with all differences intact.","Faith is the bird that feels the light and sings when the dawn is still dark. In effect, the people who change our lives the most begin to sing to us while we are still in darkness. If we listen to their song, we will see the dawning of a new part of ourselves.","Love gives beauty to everything it touches.","Let me not pray to be sheltered from dangers but to be fearless in facing them. Let me not beg for the stilling of my pain but for the heart to conquer it.  Let me not look for allies in life\'s battlefield but to my own strength.  Let me not crave in anxious fear to be saved but hope for the patience to win my freedom.  Grant me that I may not be a coward, feeling your mercy in my success alone; but let me find the grasp of your  hand in my failure.","Depth of friendship does not depend on length of acquaintance.","Clouds come floating into my life from other days no longer to shed rain or usher storm but to give colour to my sunset sky.","Where the mind is without fear and the head is held high, where knowledge is free. Where the world has not been broken up into fragments by narrow domestic walls. Where words come out from the depth of truth, where tireless striving stretches its arms toward perfection. Where the clear stream of reason has not lost it\'s way into the dreary desert sand of dead habit. Where the mind is led forward by thee into ever widening thought and action.

We have to take it as it is, try to understand it, and then to better it.","The small wisdom is like water in a glass: clear, transparent, pure.

I will not buy glass for the price of diamonds, and I will never allow patriotism to triumph over humanity as long as I live.","Love\'s gift cannot be given, it waits to be accepted.","The real frienship is like fluorescence, it shines better when everything has darken.","Love is the only reality and it is not a mere sentiment. It is the ultimate truth that lies at the heart of creation.","Let us not pray to be sheltered from dangers but to be fearless when facing them.","The butterfly counts not months but moments, and has time enough.","Men can only think.

The small truth has words which are clear; the great truth has great silence.","I am able to love my God because He gives me freedom to deny Him.","What you are you do not see, what you see is your shadow.","Discipline divorced from wisdom is not true discipline, but merely the meaningless following of custom, which is only a disguise for stupidity.","The flower which is single need not envy the thorns that are numerous.","Compliments win friends, honesty loses them.","The more one lives alone on the river or in the open country, the clearer it becomes that nothing is more beautiful or great than to perform the ordinary duties of one\'s daily life simply and naturally.","The weak can be terrible because they try furiously to appear strong.","Only in silence I find myself. Life in the city is so hectic that you lose the right perspective. It\'s important to know that our biggest resources are in our heart.","Every child comes with the message that God is not yet discouraged of man.","The same stream of life that runs through my veins night and day runs through the world and dances in rhythmic measures. It is the same life that shoots in joy through the dust of the earth in numberless blades of grass and breaks into tumultuous waves of leaves and flowers.","Let us not pray to be sheltered from dangers but to be fearless when facing them.\\" \\"Everything comes to us that belongs to us if we create the capacity to receive it.\\" \\"Life is perpetually creative because it contains in itself that surplus which ever overflows the boundaries of the immediate time and space, restlessly pursuing its adventure of expression in the varied forms of self-realization.\\" \\"The highest education is that which does not merely give us information but makes our life in harmony with all existence.","Power said to the world, \\"You are mine.\\" The world kept it prisoner on her throne.

If you can find peace in yourself and can spread comfort around you, you will be happier than an empress.","Inspiration follows aspiration.","To find God, you must welcome everything.","To be outspoken is easy when you do not wait to speak the complete truth.","Those who own much have much to fear.","I seem to have loved you in numberless forms, numberless times,\\nin life after life, in age after age forever.\\nHe who wants to do good, knocks at the gate; \\nHe who loves, finds the door open.","The fish in the water is silent, the animals on the earth is noisy, the bird in the air is singing.

My ears have heard much, but they thirst for more.","Music is the purest form of art, and therefore the most direct expression of beauty, with a form and spirit which is one and simple, and least encumbered with anything extraneous.

Unhappy with the portrait, she erases it and paints it again and again.","Men are cruel, but Man is kind.","Facts are many, but the truth is one.","Love is an endless mystery, because there is no reasonable cause that could explain it.","Man is worse than an animal when he is an animal.","He who is too busy doing good finds no time to be good.","Our responsibility is no longer to acquire, but to BE.","For many years, at great cost, I traveled through many countries, saw the high mountains, the oceans. The only things I did not see were the sparkling dewdrops in the grass just outside my door.","One who has never known the turbulence of life, in whom the petals of the mysterious flower within have never opened; such a one may seem happy, may seem a saint, his single track mind may impress the multitude with its power - but he is ill equipped for life\'s true adventure into the infinite.","The flower fades and dies; but he who wears the flower has not to mourn for it for ever.","In death the many become one; in life the one become many.","My dearest life, I know you are not mine forever; but do love me even if it\u2019s for this moment. After that I shall vanish into the forest where you cast me, I won\u2019t ask anyone for anything again. Give me something that can last me till I die.","Gray hairs are signs of wisdom if you hold your tongue, speak and they are but hairs, as in the young.","We are hidden in ourselves, like a truth hidden in isolated facts. When we know that this One in us is One in all, then our truth is revealed.","Do not say, \'It is morning,\' and dismiss it with a name of yesterday. See it for the first time as a newborn child that has no name.","The child learns so easily because he has a natural gift, but adults, because they are tyrants, ignore natural gifts and say that children must learn through the same process that they learned by.

Let sorrowful love wake in your eyes.","We live in the world when we love it.","Let my doing nothing when I have nothing to do, become untroubled in its depth of peace, like the evening in the seashore when the water is silent.","The fundamental desire of life is the desire to exist.","When I stand before thee at the day\'s end, thou shalt see my scars and know that I had my wounds and also my healing.","It dances today, my heart, \\n like a peacock it dances, \\n it dances. \\n It sports a mosaic of passions like a peacock\u2019s tail, \\n It soars to the sky with delight, it quests, \\n Oh wildly, it dances today, my heart, \\n like a peacock it dances.","Memory, the priestess, kills the present and offers its heart to the shrine of the dead past.","Let not the hours pass by in the dark. Kindle the lamp of love with thy life.","A mind all logic is like a knife all blade. It makes the hand bleed that uses it.","Man is immortal; therefore he must die endlessly. For life is a creative idea; it can only find itself in changing forms","Let your life lightly dance on the edges of Time like dew on the tip of a leaf.","Give Me Strength This is my prayer to thee, my lord---strike, strike at the root of penury in my heart. Give me the strength lightly to bear my joys and sorrows. Give me the strength to make my love fruitful in service.

And give me the strength to surrender my strength to thy will with love.","Art awakens a sense of real by establishing an intimate relationship between our inner being and the universe at large, bringing us a consciousness of deep joy.","And joy is everywhere; it is in the earth\'s green covering of grass; in the blue serenity of the sky.","The cure for all the illness of life is stored in the inner depth of life itself, the access to which becomes possible when we are alone. This solitude is a world in itself, full of wonders and resources unthought of. It is absurdly near; yet so unapproachably distant.","The touch of an infinite mystery passes over the trivial and the familiar, making it break out into ineffable music... The trees, the stars, and the blue hills ache with a meaning which can never be uttered in words.","Children are living beings - more living than grown-up people who have built shells of habit around themselves. Therefore it is absolutely necessary for their mental health and development that they should not have mere schools for their lessons, but a world whose guiding spirit is personal love.","You are invited to the festival of this world and your life is blessed.","Once we dreamt that we were strangers. We wake up to find that we were dear to each other.","The greed for fruit misses the flower.","The realization of our soul has its moral and its spiritual side. The moral side represents training of unselfishness, control of desire; the spiritual side represents sympathy and love. They should be taken together and never separated. The cultivation of the merely moral side of our nature leads us to the dark region of narrowness and hardness of heart, to the intolerant arrogance of goodness; and the cultivation of the merely spiritual side of our nature leads us to a still darker region of revelry in intemperance of imagination.","Love is an endless mystery, for it has nothing else to explain it.","Those who are near me do not know that you are nearer to me than they are Those who speak to me do not know that my heart is full with your unspoken words Those who crowd in my path do not know that I am walking alone with you Those who love me do not know that their love brings you to my heart","I believe in a spiritual world - not as anything separate from this world - but as its innermost truth. With the breath we draw we must always feel this truth, that we are living in God.","From the solemn gloom of the temple children run out to sit in the dust, God watches them play and forgets the priest.","Boasting is only a masked shame; it does not truly believe in itself.","Let my thoughts come to you, when I am gone, like the afterglow of sunset at the margin of starry silence.","The world has kissed my Soul with its pain, asking for its return in Songs.","Praise shames me, for I secretly beg for it.","If someone smells a flower and says he does not understand, the reply to him is: there is nothing to understand, it is only a scent. If he persists, saying: that I know, but what does it all mean? Then one has either to change the subject, or make it more abstruse by saying that the scent is the shape which the universal joy takes in the flower.","Let it not be death but completeness.  Let love melt into memory and pain into songs.  Let the flight through the sky end in the folding of the wings over the nest.  Let the last touch of your hands be gentle like the flower of the night.  Stand still, O Beautiful End, for a moment, and say your last words in silence.  I bow to you and hold up my lamp to light you on your way.","The heart wants to go on; that is its dharma. For unless it moves, it dies.","We are like newborn children, Our power is the power to grow.","We come nearest to the great when we are great in humility.","Religion is not a fractional thing that can be doled out in fixed weekly or daily measures as one among various subjects in the school syllabus. It is the truth of our complete being, the consciousness of our personal relationship with the infinite.","And because I love this life\\nI know I shall love death as well\\nThe child cries out when\\nFrom the right breast the mother\\nTakes it away, in the very next moment\\nTo find in the left one\\nIts consolation.","YOU are the big drop of dew under the lotus leaf, I am the smaller one on its upper side,\' said the dewdrop to the lake.","Only those of tranquil minds, and none else, can attain abiding joy, by realizing within their souls the Being who manifests one essence in a multiplicity of forms.","Whether joy or sorrow, pain or pleasure; whatsoever may befall thee, accept it serenely with an unvanquished heart.","Life finds its wealth by the claims of the world, and its worth by the claims of love.","What is Art? It is the response of man\'s creative soul to the call of the Real.","The newer people of this modern age are more eager to amass than to realize.","For every child that is born, it brings with it the hope that God is not yet disappointed with man.","Love is not a mere impulse, it must contain truth, which is law.","I never give answers. I lead on from one question to another. That is my leadership.","Somewhere in the arrangement of this world there seems to be a great concern about giving us delight, which shows that, in the universe, over and above the meaning of matter and forces, there is a message conveyed through the magic touch of personality. ... Is it merely because the rose is round and pink that it gives me more satisfaction than the gold which could buy me the necessities of life, or any number of slaves. ... Somehow we feel that through a rose the language of love reached our hearts.","Where roads are made I lose my way.In the wide water, in the blue sky there is no line of a track.The pathway is hidden by the birds\' wings, by the star-fires, by the flowers of the wayfaring seasons.And I ask my heart if its blood carries the wisdom of the unseen way.","In Art, man reveals himself and not his objects.","The spirit of rejection finds its support in the consciousness of separateness; the spirit of acceptance finds its base in the consciousness of unity.","Those who think to reach God by running away from the world, when and where do they expect to meet him? We are reaching him here in this very spot, now at this very moment.","The tragedy of human life consists in our vain attempts to stretch the limits of things which can never become unlimited, to reach the infinite by absurdly adding to the rungs of the ladder of the finite.","Be brave, right through, and leave for the unknown.","Night\'s darkness is a bag that bursts with the gold of the dawn.","Who are you, reader, reading my poems an hundred years hence? I cannot send you one single flower from this wealth of the spring, one single streak of gold from yonder clouds. Open your doors and look abroad. From your blossoming garden gather fragrant memories of the vanished flowers of an hundred years before. In the joy of your heart may you feel the living joy that sang one spring morning, sending its glad voice across a hundred years.","This is the ultimate end of man, to find the One which is in him; which is his truth, which is his soul; the key with which he opens the gate of the spiritual life, the heavenly kingdom.","Not hammer-strokes, but dance of the water, sings the pebbles into perfection.","Overstraining is the enemy of accomplishment. Calm strength that arises from a deep and inexhaustible source is what brings success.","From the grasses in the field to the stars in the sky, each one is doing just that; and there is such profound peace and surpassing beauty in nature because none of these tries forcibly to transgress its limitations.","We gain freedom when we have paid the full price.","God finds himself by creating.","Perhaps the crescent moon smiles in doubt at being told that it is a fragment awaiting perfection.","Nirvana is not the blowing out of the candle. It is the extinguishing of the flame because day is come.","Days are coloured bubbles that float upon the surface of fathomless nights.","Who are you, a hundred years from today, reading my poetry with curiosity?","Merely to exist is not enough.","Beauty is truth\'s smile when she beholds her own face in a perfect mirror.","Your love keeps me afloat but will remain the anchor in my soul... I don\'t really have words to describe how romantic I find that. Your love is what keeps me going, but it\'s also the anchor that keeps me close to you. I love it!","Life is given to us, we earn it by giving it.","It is no easy task to lead men. But it is easy enough to drive them.","When our universe is in harmony with man, the eternal, we know it as truth, we feel it as beauty.","The sparrow is sorry for the peacock at the burden of its tail.","Only in love are unity and duality not in conflict.","The water vessel, taken as a vessel only, raises the question, \\"Why does it exist at all?\\" Through its fitness of construction, it offers the apology for its existence. But where it is a work of beauty it has no question to answer; it has nothing to do, but to be.","The meaning of this is, that whomsoever we love, in him we find our own soul in the highest sense. The final truth of our existence lies in this. God, the Supreme Soul, is in me, as well as in my son, and my joy in my son is the realisation of this truth.","In love at one of its poles you find the personal, and at the other the impersonal. At one you have the positive assertion \u2014 Here I am; at the other the equally strong denial \u2014 I am not. Without this ego what is love? And again, with only this ego how can love be possible? \\nBondage and liberation are not antagonistic in love. For love is most free and at the same time most bound. If God were absolutely free there would be no creation. The infinite being has assumed unto himself the mystery of finitude. And in him who is love the finite and the infinite are made one.","Bees sip honey from flowers and hum their thanks when they leave. The gaudy butterfly is sure that the flowers owe thanks to him.","I leave no trace of wings in the air, but I am glad I have had my flight.","Our creation is the modification of relationship.","Emancipation from the bondage of the soil is no freedom for the tree.","He who wants to do good knocks at the gate: he who loves finds the door open.","If life\'s journey be endless where is its goal? The answer is, it is everywhere. We are in a palace which has no end, but which we have reached. By exploring it and extending our relationship with it we are ever making it more and more our own.","The greed of gain has no time or limit to its capaciousness. Its one object is to produce and consume. It has pity neither for beautiful nature nor for living human beings. It is ruthlessly ready without a moment\'s hesitation to crush beauty and life.","These paper boats of mine are meant to dance on the ripples of hours, and not reach any destination.","You can\'t cross a sea by merely staring into the water.","In the drowsy dark cave of the mind dreams build their nest with fragments dropped from day\'s caravan.","O master poet, I have sat down at thy feet. Only let me make my life simple and straight, like a flute of reed for thee to fill with music.","My day is done, and I am like a boat drawn on the beach, listening to the dance-music of the tide in the evening.","Man is a rough-hewn and woman a finished product.","A butterfly flitting from flower to flower ever remains mine, I lose the one that is netted by me.","Man goes into the noisy crowd to drown his own clamour of silence.","According to the true Indian view, our consciousness of the world, merely as the sum total of things that exist, and as governed by laws, is imperfect. But it is perfect when our consciousness realizes all things as spiritually one with it, and there","It sometimes strikes me how immensely fortunate I am that each day should take its place in my life, either reddened with the rising and setting sun, or refreshingly cool with deep, dark clouds, or blooming like a white flower in the moonlight.

When grace is lost from life, come with a burst of song. When tumultuous work raises its din on all sides shutting me out from beyond, come to me, my lord of silence, with thy peace and rest. When my beggarly heart sits crouched, shut up in a corner, break open the door, my king, and come with the ceremony of a king. When desire blinds the mind with delusion and dust, O thou holy one, thou wakeful, come with thy light and thy thunder.","Let the dead have the immortality of fame, but the living the immortality of love.","It is the docile who achieve the most impossible things in this world.","Stray birds of summer come to my window to sing and fly away. And yellow leaves of autumn, which have no songs, flutter and fall there with a sigh.","The meaning of our self is not to be found in its separateness from God and others, but in the ceaseless realization of yoga, of union; not on the side of the canvas where it is blank, but on the side where the picture is being painted.","The pious sectarian is proud because he is confident of his right of possession in God. The man of devotion is meek because he is conscious of God\'s right of love over his life and soul.","Thou hast made me endless, such is thy pleasure. This frail vessel thou emptiest again and again, and fillest it ever with fresh life.","I have on my table a violin string. It is free to move in any direction I like. If I twist one end, it responds; it is free. But it is not free to sing. So I take it and fix it into my violin. I bind it and when it is bound, it is free for the first time to sing.","Trees are the earth\'s endless effort to speak to the listening heaven.","By plucking her petals, you do not gather the beauty of the flower.","Everything comes to us that belongs to us if we create the capacity to receive it. Every difficulty slurred over will be a ghost to disturb your repose later on.

The sky groans like one in despair. I have no sleep tonight. Ever and again I open my door and look out on the darkness, my friend! I can see nothing before me. I wonder where lies thy path! By what dim shore of the ink-black river, by what far edge of the frowning forest, through what mazy depth of gloom art thou threading thy course to come to me, my friend?","O Beauty, find thyself in love, not in the flattery of thy mirror.","Whenever our life is stirred by truth, it expresses energy and comes to be filled, as it were, with a creative ardor. This consciousness of the creative urge is evidence of the force of truth on our mind.","God waits to win back his own flowers as gifts from man\'s hands.","When he has the power to see things detached from self-interest and from the insistent claims of the lust of the senses, then alone can he have the true vision of the beauty that is everywhere.","If you want to know India, study Vivekananda. In him everything is positive and nothing negative.","Those who have everything but thee, my God, laugh at those who have nothing but thyself.","The mountain remains unmoved at its seeming defeat by the mist.","You have given me Your love, filling the world with Your gifts.","Our scientific world is our world of reasoning. It has its greatness and uses and attractions. We are ready to pay homage due to it. But when it claims to have discovered the real world for us and laughs at the worlds of all simple-minded men, then we must say it is like a general grown intoxicated with his power, usurping the throne of his king","For the current of our spiritual life creeds, rituals and channels that may thwart or help, according to their fixity or openness. When a symbol or spiritual idea becomes rigidly elaborate in its construction, it supplants the idea which it should support.","The higher nature in man always seeks for something which transcends itself and yet is its deepest truth; which claims all its sacrifice, yet makes this sacrifice its own recompense. This is man\'s dharma, man\'s religion, and man\'s self is the vessel.","Leave out my name from the gift if it be a burden, but keep my song.","In desperate hope I go and search for her in all the corners of my house.

But infinite is thy mansion, my lord, and seeking her I have come to thy door.","I have spent many days stringing and unstringing my instrument while the song I came to sing remains unsung.","Let my love like sunlight surround you and yet give you illumined freedom.","If religion, instead of being the manifestation of a spiritual ideal, gives prominence to scriptures and external rites, then does it disturb the peace more than anything else.","Love\'s over brimming mystery joins death and life. It has filled my cup of pain with joy.","And it shall be my endeavour to reveal thee in my actions, knowing it is thy power gives me strength to act.","Death belongs to life as birth does The walk is in the raising of the foot as in the laying of it down","Asks the Possible of the Impossible, \\"Where is your dwelling-place?\\" \\"In the dreams of the Impotent,\\" comes the answer.","Faith is a bird that can see the light when it is dawn and starts singing in the dark.","At the immortal touch of thy hands my little heart loses its limits in joy and gives birth to utterance ineffable.","Our self (Soul) is maya (an illusion) where it is merely individual and finite, where it considers its separateness as absolute; it is satyam (truth) where it recognizes its essence in the universal and infinite, in the Supreme Self, in paramatman (God). This is what Christ means when he says, \\"Before Abraham was, I am\\" (i.e. before Abraham was God, who is the same that is in my soul - I am That.)","When I go from hence, let this be my parting word, that what I have seen is unsurpassable.

I do not love him because he is good, but because he is my little child. How should you know how dear he can be when you try to weigh his merits against his faults?

We have a personality to which matter and force are unmeaning unless related to something infinitely personal, whose nature we have discovered, in some measure, in human love, in the greatness of the good, in the martyrdom of heroic souls, in the ineffable beauty of nature, which can never be a mere physical fact nor anything but an expression of personality.","The birds looked upon me as nothing but a man, quite a trifling creature without wings-and they would have nothing to do with me. Were it not so I would build a small cabin for myself among their crowd of nests and pass my days counting the sea waves.","The song I came to sing remains unsung to this day.

On the seashore of endless worlds the children meet with shouts and dances.They build their houses with sand, and they play with empty shells. With withered leaves they weave their boats and smilingly float them on the vast deep. Children have their play on the seashore of worlds.They know not how to swim, they know not how to cast nets. Pearl-fishers dive for pearls, merchants sail in their ships, while children gather pebbles and scatter them again. They seek not for hidden treasures, they know not how to cast nets.The sea surges up with laughter, and pale gleams the smile of the sea-beach. Death-dealing waves sing meaningless ballads to the children, even like a mother while rocking her baby\u2019s cradle. The sea plays with children, and pale gleams the smile of the sea-beach.On the seashore of endless worlds children meet. Tempest roams in the pathless sky, ships are wrecked in the trackless water, death is abroad and children play.

Ah, the light dances, my darling, at the centre of my life; the light strikes, my darling, the chords of my love; the sky opens, the wind runs wild, laughter passes over the earth. The butterflies spread their sails on the sea of light. Lilies and jasmines surge up on the crest of the waves of light. The light is shattered into gold on every cloud, my darling, and it scatters gems in profusion. Mirth spreads from leaf to leaf, my darling, and gladness without measure.

He comes and goes, like the ferry-boat, from this shore to the other; the babbling hum of his talk, the fitful echo of his song, is heard; the slight movement of his pursuit of his own petty desires is seen in the world\'s market-places: but how feeble, how temporary, how tragically meaningless it all seems amidst the immense aloofness of the Universe!

Where Nature is ever hidden, and cowers under mist and cloud, snow and darkness, there man feels himself master; he regards his desires, his works, as permanent; he wants to perpetuate them, he looks towards posterity, he raises monuments, he writes biographies; he even goes the length of erecting tombstones over the dead.

We sit upon a swing, and the storm winds give us a wild push from behind. My bride starts up with fear and delight, she trembles and clings to my breast. Long have I served her tenderly. I made for her a bed of flowers and I closed the doors to shut out the rude light from her eyes. I kissed her gently on her lips and whispered softly in her ears till she half swooned in languor. She was lost in the endless mist of vague sweetness. She answered not to my touch, my songs failed to arouse her. To-night has come to us the call of the storm from the wild. My bride has shivered and stood up, she has clasped my hand and come out. Her hair is flying in the wind, her veil is fluttering, her garland rustles over her breast. The push of death has swung her into life. We are face to face and heart to heart, my bride and I.","The greedy man who is fond of his fish stew has no compunction in cutting up the fish according to his need.

Her problem was the problem of the world in miniature. India is too vast in its area and too diverse in its races. It is many countries packed in one geographical receptacle. It is just the opposite of what Europe truly is, namely, one country made into many. Thus Europe in its culture and growth has had the advantage of the strength of the many as well as the strength of the one. India, on the contrary, being naturally many, yet adventitiously one, has all along suffered from the looseness of its diversity and the feebleness of its unity. A true unity is like a round globe, it rolls on, carrying its burden easily; but diversity is a many-cornered thing which has to be dragged and pushed with all force. Be it said to the credit of India that this diversity was not her own creation; she has had to accept it as a fact from the beginning of her history. In America and Australia, Europe has simplified her problem by almost exterminating the original population. Even in the present age this spirit of extermination is making itself manifest, in the inhospitable shutting out of aliens, by those who themselves were aliens in the lands they now occupy. But India tolerated difference of races from the first, and that spirit of toleration has acted all through her history. Her caste system is the outcome of this spirit of toleration. For India has all along been trying experiments in evolving a social unity within which all the different peoples could be held together, while fully enjoying the freedom of maintaining their own differences. The tie has been as loose as possible, yet as close as the circumstances permitted. This has produced something like a United States of a social federation, whose common name is Hinduism.

Suddenly some unseen force squeezed my heart in an iron grip, and it throbbed with intense pain. I returned to my house, but the pain clung to me. Whether I read, wrote, or did any other work, I could not shake that weight off my heart; a heavy load seemed to be always swinging from my heart-strings. In the evening, calming myself a little, I began to reflect: \u2018What ails me?\u2019 From within came the question: \u2018Where is your Surabala now?\u2019 I replied: \u2018I gave her up of my free will.

What is Surabala to me?\u2019 My heart rejoined: \u2018To-day Surabala is nobody to you. But what might she not have been to you?\u2019 Ah! that\'s true. What might she not have been to me? Dearest to me of all things, closer to me than the world besides, the sharer of all my life\'s joys and sorrows,\u2014she might have been. And now, she is so distant, so much of a stranger, that to look on her is forbidden, to talk with her is improper, and to think of her is a sin!\u2014while this Ram Lochan, coming suddenly from nowhere, has muttered a few set religious texts, and in one swoop has carried off Surabala from the rest of mankind! I have not come to preach a new ethical code, or to revolutionise society; I have no wish to tear asunder domestic ties. I am only expressing the exact working of my mind, though it may not be reasonable. I could not by any means banish from my mind the sense that Surabala, reigning there within shelter of Ram Lochan\'s home, was mine far more than his.

There is none to count thy minutes. Days and nights pass and ages bloom and fade like flowers. Thou knowest how to wait. Thy centuries follow each other perfecting a small wild flower. We have no time to lose, and having no time we must scramble for a chances. We are too poor to be late. And thus it is that time goes by while I give it to every querulous man who claims it, and thine altar is empty of all offerings to the last.

You have to rush and run and march if you must fight or take the best place in the market. You strain your nerves and are on the alert when you chase opportunities that are always on the wing. But there are ideals which do not play hide-and-seek with our life; they slowly grow from seed to flower, from flower to fruit; they require infinite space and heaven\'s light to mature, and the fruits that they produce can survive years of insult and neglect. The East with her ideals, in whose bosom are stored the ages of sunlight and silence of stars, can patiently wait till the West, hurrying after the expedient, loses breath and stops. Europe, while busily speeding to her engagements, disdainfully casts her glance from her carriage window at the reaper reaping his harvest in the field, and in her intoxication of speed cannot but think him as slow and ever receding backwards. But the speed comes to its end, the engagement loses its meaning and the hungry heart clamours for food, till at last she comes to the lowly reaper reaping his harvest in the sun. For if the office cannot wait, or the buying and selling, or the craving for excitement, love waits and beauty and the wisdom of suffering and the fruits of patient devotion and reverent meekness of simple faith. And thus shall wait the East till her time comes.

The people accept this all-pervading mental slavery with cheerfulness and pride because of their nervous desire to turn themselves into a machine of power, called the Nation, and emulate other machines in their collective worldliness.","The highest mission of education is to help us to realise the inner principle of the unity of all knowledge and all the activities of our social and spiritual being.","I\'ll be the cloud and you the moon.

The evening star will come out when my voyage is done and the plaintive notes of the twilight melodies be struck up from the King\u2019s gateway.","We are in misery because we are creatures of self - the self that is unyielding and narrow, that reflects no light, that is blind to the infinite. Our self is loud with its own discordant clamour - it is not the tuned harp whose chords vibrate with the music of the eternal. Sighs of discontent and weariness of failure, idle regrets for the past and anxieties for the future are troubling our shallow hearts because we have not found our souls, and the self-revealing spirit has not been manifest within us. Hence our cry.","In the depth of night when no one is awake to arrest me\u2014me, the least of all men\u2014I will silently creep to my mother\u2019s arms and fall asleep, and may I never wake again!","It is the tears of the earth that keep her smiles in bloom.","Early in the day it was whispered that we should sail in a boat, only thou and I, and never a soul in the world would know of this our pilgrimage to no country and to no end.

Who knows when the chains will be off, and the boat, like the last glimmer of sunset, vanish into the night?","Hands cling to hands and eyes linger on eyes: thus begins the record of our hearts. It is the moonlit night of March; the sweet smell of henna is in the air; my flute lies on the earth neglected and your garland of flowers in unfinished. This love between you and me is simple as a song. Your veil of the saffron colour makes my eyes drunk. The jasmine wreath that you wove me thrills to my heart like praise. It is a game of giving and withholding, revealing and screening again; some smiles and some little shyness, and some sweet useless struggles. This love between you and me is simple as a song. No mystery beyond the present; no striving for the impossible; no shadow behind the charm; no groping in the depth of the dark. This love between you and me is simple as a song. We do not stray out of all words into the ever silent; we do not raise our hands to the void for things beyond hope. It is enough what we give and we get. We have not crushed the joy to the utmost to wring from it the wine of pain. This love between you and me is simple as a song.","In the music of the rushing stream sounds the joyful assurance, \\"I shall become the sea.\\" It is not a vain assumption; it is true humility, for it is the truth. The river has no other alternative. On both sides of its banks it has numerous fields and forests, villages and towns; it can serve them in various ways, cleanse them and feed them, carry their produce from place to place. But it can have only partial relations with these, and however long it may linger among them it remains separate; it never can become a town or a forest. But it can and does become the sea. The lesser moving water has its affinity with the great motionless water of the ocean. It moves through the thousand objects on its onward course, and its motion finds its finality when it reaches the sea.","Peace, my heart, let the time for the parting be sweet. Let it not be a death but completeness. Let love melt into memory and pain into songs. Let the flight through the sky end in the folding of the wings over the nest. Let the last touch of your hands be gentle like the flower of the night. Stand still, O Beautiful End, for a moment, and say your last words in silence. I bow to you and hold up my lamp to light you on your way.","He whom I enclose with my name is weeping in this dungeon. I am ever busy building this wall all around; and as this wall goes up into the sky day by day I lose sight of my true being in its dark shadow.

How often have I tried to write of such, but never got it done! There was not a line of ripple on the river; and from away over there, where the farthest shore of the distant main stream is seen beyond the other edge of the midway belt of sand, right up to this shore, glimmers a broad band of moonlight. Not a human being, not a boat in sight; not a tree, nor blade of grass on the fresh-formed island sand-bank.It seemed as though a desolate moon was rising upon a devastated earth; a random river wandering through a lifeless solitude; a long-drawn fairy-tale coming to a close over a deserted world,\u2014all the kings and the princesses, their ministers and friends and their golden castles vanished, leaving the Seven Seas and Thirteen Rivers and the Unending Moor, over which the adventurous princes fared forth, wanly gleaming in the pale moonlight.

I feel the embrace of freedom in a thousand bonds of delight. Thou ever pourest for me the fresh draught of thy wine of various colours and fragrance, filling this earthen vessel to the brim. My world will light its hundred different lamps with thy flame and place them before the altar of thy temple. No, I will never shut the doors of my senses. The delights of sight and hearing and touch will bear thy delight. Yes, all my illusions will burn into illumination of joy, and all my desires ripen into fruits of love.","Thy sunbeam comes upon this earth of mine with arms outstretched and stands at my door the livelong day to carry back to thy feet clouds made of my tears and sighs and songs. With fond delight thou wrappest about thy starry breast that mantle of misty cloud, turning it into numberless shapes and folds and colouring it with hues everchanging. It is so light and so fleeting, tender and tearful and dark, that is why thou lovest it, O thou spotless and serene. And that is why it may cover thy awful white light with its pathetic shadows.","What divine drink wouldst thou have, my God, from this overflowing cup of my life?

In the silence of gathering night I asked her, `Maiden, your lights are all lit---then where do you go with your lamp? My house is all dark and lonesome---lend me your light.\' She raised her dark eyes on my face and stood for a moment doubtful. `I have come,\' she said at last, `to dedicate my lamp to the sky.\' I stood and watched her light uselessly burning in the void. In the moonless gloom of midnight I ask her, `Maiden, what is your quest, holding the lamp near your heart? My house is all dark and lonesome---lend me your light.\' She stopped for a minute and thought and gazed at my face in the dark. `I have brought my light,\' she said, `to join the carnival of lamps.\' I stood and watched her little lamp uselessly lost among lights.","I must not hesitate to acknowledge where Europe is great, for great she is without doubt. We cannot help loving her with all our heart, and paying her the best homage of our admiration,\u2014the Europe who, in her literature and art, pours out an inexhaustible cascade of beauty and truth fertilizing all countries and all time; the Europe who, with a mind which is titanic in its untiring power, is sweeping the height and the depth of the universe, winning her homage of knowledge from the infinitely great and the infinitely small, applying all the resources of her great intellect and heart in healing the sick and alleviating those miseries of man which up till now we were contented to accept in a spirit of hopeless resignation; the Europe who is making the earth yield more fruit than seemed possible, coaxing and compelling the great forces of nature into man\'s service.

Thy face is bent from above, thy eyes look down on my eyes, and my heart has touched thy feet.","I take pride in this great wall, and I plaster it with dust and sand lest a least hole should be left in this name; and for all the care I take I lose sight of my true being.","Let all the strains of joy mingle in my last song---the joy that makes the earth flow over in the riotous excess of the grass, the joy that sets the twin brothers, life and death, dancing over the wide world, the joy that sweeps in with the tempest, shaking and waking all life with laughter, the joy that sits still with its tears on the open red lotus of pain, and the joy that throws everything it has upon the dust, and knows not a word.","The sands of desert may be very white and shiny, but I would much rather sow my seeds in black soil.","no one should add to the burden of the world, but that each should try to lighten it.","Kab\xeer says: \u201cIf you merge your life in the Ocean of Life, you will find your life in the Supreme Land of Bliss.","The increased facilities of communication and exchange of thought, the teachings of history, the unity of government, the rise of literature and the efforts of the Congress over a period of time have together begun to make us realize that we belong to one country and are one people; that whether in joy or in sorrow our destiny is one; and that we cannot prosper unless we discover the ties which make us one, and seek to strengthen them.","The truth is that the spirit of conflict and conquest is at the origin and in the centre of Western nationalism; its basis is not social co-operation.","Thus it is that thy joy in me is so full. Thus it is that thou hast come down to me. O thou lord of all heavens, where would be thy love if I were not? Thou hast taken me as thy partner of all this wealth. In my heart is the endless play of thy delight. In my life thy will is ever taking shape. And for this, thou who art the King of kings hast decked thyself in beauty to captivate my heart.

This relation of understanding is partial, but the relation of love is complete. In love the sense of difference is obliterated and the human soul fulfils its purpose in perfection, transcending the limits of itself and reaching across the threshold of the infinite. Therefore love is the highest bliss that man can attain to, for through it alone he truly knows that he is more than himself, and that he is at one with the All.","Thy desire at once puts out the light from the lamp it touches with its breath.

Beats of their wings fill the air with tremulous shadows, and sleepless thoughts in our minds leave their nests to take flight across the desert of dimness, in the passionate thirst for forms.

According to it, everything that is low in the scale of beings is merely nature, and whatever has the stamp of perfection on it, intellectual or moral, is human-nature. It is like dividing the bud and the blossom into two separate categories, and putting their grace to the credit of two different and antithetical principles. But the Indian mind never has any hesitation in acknowledging its kinship with nature, its unbroken relation with all.The fundamental unity of creation was not simply a philosophical speculation for India; it was her life-object to realise this great harmony in feeling and in action. With mediation and service, with a regulation of life, she cultivated her consciousness in such a way that everything had a spiritual meaning to her. The earth, water and light, fruits and flowers, to her were not merely physical phenomena to be turned to use and then left aside. They were necessary to her in the attainment of her ideal of perfection, as every note is necessary to the completeness of the symphony. India intuitively felt that the essential fact of this world has a vital meaning for us; we have to be fully alive to it and establish a conscious relation with it, not merely impelled by scientific curiosity or greed of material advantage, but realising it in the spirit of sympathy, with a large feeling of joy and peace.","Where dost thou stand behind them all, my lover, hiding thyself in the shadows? They push thee and pass thee by on the dusty road, taking thee for naught. I wait here weary hours spreading my offerings for thee, while passers-by come and take my flowers, one by one, and my basket is nearly empty. The morning time is past, and the noon. In the shade of evening my eyes are drowsy with sleep. Men going home glance at me and smile and fill me with shame. I sit like a beggar maid, drawing my skirt over my face, and when they ask me, what it is I want, I drop my eyes and answer them not. Oh, how, indeed, could I tell them that for thee I wait, and that thou hast promised to come. How could I utter for shame that I keep for my dowry this poverty. Ah, I hug this pride in the secret of my heart. I sit on the grass and gaze upon the sky and dream of the sudden splendour of thy coming---all the lights ablaze, golden pennons flying over thy car, and they at the roadside standing agape, when they see thee come down from thy seat to raise me from the dust, and set at thy side this ragged beggar girl a-tremble with shame and pride, like a creeper in a summer breeze. But time glides on and still no sound of the wheels of thy chariot. Many a procession passes by with noise and shouts and glamour of glory. Is it only thou who wouldst stand in the shadow silent and behind them all? And only I who would wait and weep and wear out my heart in vain longing?","The hidden clash of a silent conflict like this is far harder to bear than an open quarrel.","The rain has held back for days and days, my God, in my arid heart. The horizon is fiercely naked---not the thinnest cover of a soft cloud, not the vaguest hint of a distant cool shower. Send thy angry storm, dark with death, if it is thy wish, and with lashes of lightning startle the sky from end to end. But call back, my lord, call back this pervading silent heat, still and keen and cruel, burning the heart with dire despair.

To clutch hold of that which is untrue as though it were true, is only to throttle oneself. May I be saved from such self-destruction.","When it was day they came into my house and said, `We shall only take the smallest room here.\' They said, `We shall help you in the worship of your God and humbly accept only our own share in his grace\'; and then they took their seat in a corner and they sat quiet and meek.

Those who can desire with all their soul and enjoy with all their heart, those who have no hesitation or scruple, it is they who are the anointed of Providence. Nature spreads out her riches and loveliest treasures for their benefit. They swim across streams, leap over walls, kick open doors, to help themselves to whatever is worth taking. In such a getting one can rejoice; such wresting as this gives value to the thing taken.

When sleep overcame me I lay upon the bed that was for my lord, and on waking up I found I was a prisoner in my own treasure-house.\' `Prisoner, tell me, who was it that wrought this unbreakable chain?\' `It was I,\' said the prisoner, `who forged this chain very carefully. I thought my invincible power would hold the world captive leaving me in a freedom undisturbed. Thus night and day I worked at the chain with huge fires and cruel hard strokes. When at last the work was done and the links were complete and unbreakable, I found that it held me in its grip.","Who are you, reader, reading my poems an hundred years hence?I cannot send you one single flower from this wealth of the spring, one single streak of gold from yonder clouds.Open your doors and look abroad.From your blossoming garden gather fragrant memories of the vanished flowers of an hundred years before.In the joy of your heart may you feel the living joy that sang one spring morning, sending its glad voice across an hundred years.\u2014 Rabindranath Tagore, \u201c85,  The Gardener.

Neither is a profusion of ornament unbecoming for a woman, nor a profusion of untruth.","political and the commercial man, the man of the limited purpose.","I have never been able to make out,\\" I began, \\"why women are so shy about being caught reading poetry.We men--lawyers, mechanics, or what not--may well feel ashamed. If we must read poetry, it should be at dead of night, within closed doors. But you women are so akin to poesy. The Creator Himself is a lyric poet, and Jayadeva must have practised the divine art seated at His feet.","The song that I came to sing remains unsung to this day. I have spent my days in stringing and in unstringing my instrument. The time has not come true, the words have not been rightly set; only there is the agony of wishing in my heart. The blossom has not opened; only the wind is sighing by. I have not seen his face, nor have I listened to his voice; only I have heard his gentle footsteps from the road before my house.","This frail vessel thou emptiest again and again, and fillest it ever with fresh life. This little flute of a reed thou hast carried over hills and dales, and hast breathed through it melodies eternally new... Thy infinite gifts come to me only on those very small hand of mine. Ages pass, and still thou pourest, and still there is room to fill.","Raicharan was twelve years old when he came as a servant to his master\'s house. He belonged to the same caste as his master and was given his master\'s little son to nurse. As time went on the boy left Raicharan\'s arms to go to school. From school he went on to college, and after college he entered the judicial service. Always, until he married, Raicharan was his sole attendant.","I am here to sing thee songs. In this hall of thine I have a corner seat. In thy world I have no work to do; my useless life can only break out in tunes without a purpose. When the hour strikes for thy silent worship at the dark temple of midnight, command me, my master, to stand before thee to sing. When in the morning air the golden harp is tuned, honour me, commanding my presence.","Now nearly every small Bengali maiden had heard long ago about her father-in-law\u2019s house; but we were a little new-fangled, and had kept these things from our child, so that Mini at this question must have been a trifle bewildered. But she would not show it, and with ready tact replied: \u2018Are you going there?","When at last we have to die it will be time enough to get cold.While we are on fire let us seethe and boil.","Here is thy footstool and there rest thy feet where live the poorest, and lowliest, and lost. When I try to bow to thee, my obeisance cannot reach down to the depth where thy feet rest among the poorest, and lowliest, and lost. Pride can never approach to where thou walkest in the clothes of the humble among the poorest, and lowliest, and lost. My heart can never find its way to where thou keepest company with the companionless among the poorest, the lowliest, and the lost.","O Fool, try to carry thyself upon thy own shoulders! O beggar, to come beg at thy own door! Leave all thy burdens on his hands who can bear all, and never look behind in regret. Thy desire at once puts out the light from the lamp it touches with its breath. It is unholy---take not thy gifts through its unclean hands. Accept only what is offered by sacred love.","Amongst men of the Cabuliwallah\u2019s class, however, it is well known that the words father-in-law\u2019s house have a double meaning. It is a euphemism for jail, the place where we are well cared for, at no expense to ourselves. In this sense would the sturdy pedlar take my daughter\u2019s question. \u2018Oh,\u2019 he would say, shaking his fist at an invisible policeman, \u2018I will thrash my father-in-law!","My song has put off her adornments. She has no pride of dress and decoration. Ornaments would mar our union; they would come between thee and me; their jingling would drown thy whispers. My poet\'s vanity dies in shame before thy sight. O master poet, I have sat down at thy feet. Only let me make my life simple and straight, like a flute of reed for thee to fill with music.","The attitude of the God-conscious man of the Upanishad towards the universe is one of a deep feeling of adoration. His object of worship is present everywhere. It is the one living truth that makes all realities true. This truth is not only of knowledge but of devotion.","think","Mientras estemos en llamas, sepamos arder y bullir","THE fish in the water is silent, the animal on the earth is noisy, the bird in the air is singing, But Man has in him the silence of the sea, the noise of the earth and the music of the air.","Even he whose near ones have all died, one by one, is not alone-companionship comes for him from behind the screen of death.","On death the many become one, in life the one becomes many.","I am a pilgrim of the Unknown -That is my joy.It raises and resolvesAll my conflicts. No sooner has the Known bound me fast in her net,Than appears the UnknownAnd it bewilders me!- Poem 30","The man who aims at his own aggrandizement underrates everything else. Compared to his ego the rest of the world is unreal. Thus in order to be fully conscious of the reality of all, one has to be free himself from the bonds of personal desires. This discipline we have to go through to prepare ourselves for our social duties - for sharing the burdens of our fellow-beings. Every endeavor to attain a larger life requires of man \\"to gain by giving away, and not to be greedy.\\" And thus to expand gradually the consciousness of one\'s unity with all is the striving of humanity.","never be taught.\\" The cage bird says, \\"Alas for me, I know not the songs of the woodlands.\\" Their love is intense with longing, but they never can fly wing to wing. Through the bars of the cage they look, and vain is their wish to know each other. They flutter their wings in yearning, and sing, \\"Come closer, my love!\\" The free bird cries, \\"It cannot be, I fear the closed doors of the cage.\\" The cage bird whispers, \\"Alas, my wings are powerless and dead.","Baby\'s WorldI wish I could take a quiet corner in the heart of my baby\'s veryown world. I know it has stars that talk to him, and a sky that stoopsdown to his face to amuse him with its silly clouds and rainbows. Those who make believe to be dumb, and look as if they nevercould move, come creeping to his window with their stories and withtrays crowded with bright toys. I wish I could travel by the road that crosses baby\'s mind,and out beyond all bounds; Where messengers run errands for no cause between the kingdomsof kings of no history; Where Reason makes kites of her laws and flies them, the Truthsets Fact free from its fetters.","The nature and course of the love between man and woman is determined not only by the individual characters of the lovers; it is influenced also by the imapct of their circumstances on them. The river brings down its gushing nature from the mountain-top that gives it birth, but it acquires its distinctiveness from the contour of the land through which it flows. The same is the case with love. On the one hand, there is the inner feeling, on the other, the conflict with outward circumstances. It is the combination of these two factors that gives the complete picture its individuality.(Author\u2019s Note)","At the very name of another country, my heart would go out to it, and at the sight of a foreigner in the streets, I would fall to weaving a network of dreams,\u2014the mountains, the glens, and the forests of his distant home, with his cottage in its setting, and the free and independent life of far-away wilds.","My heart is homesick to-day for the one sweet hour across the sea of time.","They knew that mere appearance and disappearance are on the surface like waves on the sea, but life which is permanent knows no decay or diminution.","I am listless, I am a wanderer in my heart.In the sunny haze of the languid hours, what vast vision of thine takes shape in the blue of the sky!","It was chilly weather. Through the window the rays of the sun touched my feet, and the slight warmth was very welcome. It was almost eight o\'clock, and the early pedestrians were returning home with their heads covered.","Neither the colourless vagueness of cosmopolitanism, nor the fierce self-idolatry of nation-worship, is the goal of human history. And India has been trying to accomplish her task through social regulation of differences, on the one hand, and the spiritual recognition of unity on the other. She has made grave errors in setting up the boundary walls too rigidly between races, in perpetuating in her classifications the results of inferiority; often she has crippled her children\'s minds and narrowed their lives in order to fit them into her social forms; but for centuries new experiments have been made and adjustments carried out.","It is very simple to be happy, but it is very difficult to be simple","\u0985\u09ae\u09c3\u09a4 \u099c\u09bf\u09a8\u09bf\u09b8\u099f\u09be \u09b0\u09b8\u09c7\u09b0 \u09ae\u09a7\u09cd\u09af\u09c7 \u09a8\u09be\u0987, \u09b0\u09b8\u09ac\u09cb\u09a7\u09c7\u09b0 \u09ae\u09a7\u09cd\u09af\u09c7\u0987 \u0986\u099b\u09c7\u0964","When thou commandest me to sing it seems that my heart would break with pride; and I look to thy face, and tears come to my eyes. All that is harsh and dissonant in my life melts into one sweet harmony---and my adoration spreads wings like a glad bird on its flight across the sea. I know thou takest pleasure in my singing. I know that only as a singer I come before thy presence. I touch by the edge of the far-spreading wing of my song thy feet which I could never aspire to reach. Drunk with the joy of singing I forget myself and call thee friend who art my lord.","the light of our home also was to depart to her husband\'s house, and leave her father\'s in the shadow.","In love we find a joy which is ultimate because it is the ultimate truth.","Oh! what lies we women have to tell! When we are mothers, we tell lies to pacify our children; and when we are wives, we tell lies to pacify the fathers of our children. We are never free from this necessity.","Wherever our heart touches the One, in the small or the big, it finds the touch of the infinite.","Haralal explained why the money came to his house at night, like birds to their nest, to be scattered next morning.","My debts are large, my failures great, my shame secret and heavy; yet when I come to ask for my good, I quake in fear lest my prayer be granted. He","I am like the night to you, little flower.I can only give you peace and a wakeful silence hidden in the dark.When in the morning you open your eyes, I shall leave you to a world a-hum with bees, and songful with birds.My last gift to you will be a tear dropped into the depth of your youth; it will make your smile all the sweeter, and bemist your outlook on the pitiless mirth of day.","organization grows vaster, and selfishness attains supremacy.","\u09a8\u09be\u09ae \u09ae\u09a8\u09c7 \u0995\u09b0\u09bf\u09af\u09bc\u09be \u09b0\u09be\u0996\u09be \u09a4\u09cb \u09b8\u09cd\u09ae\u09c3\u09a4\u09bf \u09a8\u09b9\u09c7, \u09aa\u09cd\u09b0\u09be\u09a3 \u09a7\u09b0\u09bf\u09af\u09bc\u09be \u09b0\u09be\u0996\u09be\u0987 \u09b8\u09cd\u09ae\u09c3\u09a4\u09bf\u0964","I didn\'t write the history of my flight in the sky,, still I flew for sheer joy.","The traveller has to knock at every alien door to come to his own, and one has to wander through all the outer worlds to reach the innermost shrine at the end. My eyes strayed far and wide before I shut them and said, \\"Here art thou!\\" The question and the cry, \\"Oh, where?\\" melt into tears of a thousand streams and deluge the world with the flood of the assurance, \\"I am!\\" XIII","O you mad, you superbly drunk! If you kick open your doors and play the fool in public; If you empty your bag in a night, and snap your fingers at prudence; If you walk in curious paths and play with useless things; Reck not rhyme or reason; If you break the rudder in two unfurling your sails before the storm:Then I will follow you, comrade, and be drunken and go to the dogs. I have wasted my days and nights in the company of steady wise neighbors. Much knowing has turned my hair grey, and much watching has made my sight dim. For years I have gathered and heaped all scraps and fragments of things; Crush them and dance upon them, and scatter them all to the winds! For I know \u2019tis the height of wisdom to be drunken and go to the dogs. Let all crooked scruples vanish, let me hopelessly lose my way. Let a gust of wild giddiness come and sweep me away from my anchors. The world is peopled with worthies, and workers useful and clever; There are men who are easily the first, and men who come decently next: Let them be happy and prosperous, and let me be foolishly futile. For I know \u2019tis the end of all works to be drunken and go to the dogs. I swear to surrender this moment all claim to the ranks of the sensible. I let go my pride of learning and judgment of right and of wrong. I\u2019ll shatter the vessel of memory, scattering the last drop of tears; With the foam of the ruby red wine, I\u2019ll bathe and brighten my laughter. The badge of the proper and prim I\u2019ll tear into shreds for the nonce.

never to follow the West in its acceptance of the organized selfishness of Nationalism as its religion, never to gloat upon the feebleness of its neighbours, never to be unscrupulous in its behaviour to the weak, where it can be gloriously mean with impunity, while turning its right cheek of brighter humanity for the kiss of admiration to those who have the power to deal it a blow. Some of the newspapers praised my utterances for their poetical qualities, while adding with a leer that it was the poetry of a defeated people. I felt they were right. Japan had been taught in a modern school the lesson how to become powerful. The schooling is done and she must enjoy the fruits of her lessons.","Perhaps the scenes of travel conjure themselves up before me and pass and repass in my imagination all the more vividly, because I lead such a vegetable existence that a call to travel would fall upon me like a thunder-bolt.","The West in the voice of her thundering cannon had said at the door of Japan, Let there be a nation\u2014and there was a Nation.

Why is it that I saw in an English paper an expression of bitterness at Japan\'s boasting of her superiority of civilization\u2014the thing that the British, along with other nations, has been carrying on for ages without blushing? Because the idealism of selfishness must keep itself drunk with a continual dose of self-laudation. But the same vices which seem so natural and innocuous in its own life make it surprised and angry at their unpleasantness when seen in other nations.","I shall ever try to drive all evils away from my heart and keep my love in flower, knowing that thou hast thy seat in the inmost shrine of my heart.","Alas, for our foolish human nature!

These parasites take it to be an insult if they are asked to do any service. They get head-aches at the least touch of the kitchen smoke. They are visited with sudden rheumatism the moment they are asked to run errands.","In the night the song came to me; but you were not there.It found the words for which I had been seeking all day. Yes, in the stillness a moment after dark they throbbed into music, even as the stars then began to pulse with light; but you were not there.

It represents the active aspect of inertia which has the appearance of freedom, but not its truth, and therefore gives rise to slavery both within its boundaries and outside.","The day is no more, the shadow is upon the earth. It is time that I go to the stream to fill my pitcher. The evening air is eager with the sad music of the water. Ah, it calls me out into the dusk. In the lonely lane there is no passer-by, the wind is up, the ripples are rampant in the river. I know not if I shall come back home. I know not whom I shall chance to meet. There at the fording in the little boat the unknown man plays upon his lute.","...When you\'re mad it becomes easy to solve many difficult problems. Madness is a pair of Arabian Nights shoes; if you put them on you can leap clear of thousands of bogus questions.\'\'Bogus questions? What exactly do you mean by bogus?\'\'For instance, what will people say? What will happen in the future?","Let those who are snake-charmers play with snakes; if harm comes to them, they are prepared for it. But these boys are so innocent, all the world is ready with its blessing to protect them. They play with a snake not knowing its nature, and when we see them smilingly, trustfully, putting their hands within reach of its fangs, then we understand how terribly dangerous the snake is.","I really did think at one time that I was on the verge of becoming a poet, but Providence was kind enough to save me from that disaster.","But there are ideals which do not play hide-and-seek with our life; they slowly grow from seed to flower, from flower to fruit; they require infinite space and heaven\'s light to mature, and the fruits that they produce can survive years of insult and neglect.","He it is, the innermost one, who awakens my being with his deep hidden touches. He it is who puts his enchantment upon these eyes and joyfully plays on the chords of my heart in varied cadence of pleasure and pain. He it is who weaves the web of this maya in evanescent hues of gold and silver, blue and green, and lets peep out through the folds his feet, at whose touch I forget myself. Days come and ages pass, and it is ever he who moves my heart in many a name, in many a guise, in many a rapture of joy and of sorrow.","That I should make much of myself and turn it on all sides, thus casting coloured shadows on thy radiance---such is thy maya. Thou settest a barrier in thine own being and then callest thy severed self in myriad notes. This thy self-separation has taken body in me. The poignant song is echoed through all the sky in many-coloured tears and smiles, alarms and hopes; waves rise up and sink again, dreams break and form. In me is thy own defeat of self. This screen that thou hast raised is painted with innumerable figures with the brush of the night and the day. Behind it thy seat is woven in wondrous mysteries of curves, casting away all barren lines of straightness. The great pageant of thee and me has overspread the sky. With the tune of thee and me all the air is vibrant, and all ages pass with the hiding and seeking of thee and me.","Even if she could have got so far without a quarrel, still there would have been a great hue and cry about the marriage itself. First, it never happened. Secondly, how could there be a marriage between a princess of the Warrior Caste and a boy of the priestly Brahman Caste? Her readers would have imagined at once that the writer was preaching against our social customs in an underhand way. And they would write letters to the papers.","Is it beyond thee to be glad with the gladness of this rhythm? to be tossed and lost and broken in the whirl of this fearful joy? All things rush on, they stop not, they look not behind, no power can hold them back, they rush on. Keeping steps with that restless, rapid music, seasons come dancing and pass away---colours, tunes, and perfumes pour in endless cascades in the abounding joy that scatters and gives up and dies every moment.","The product of this inner life is a living product. It will be needed when the youth returns home weary and dust-laden, when the soldier is wounded, when the wealth is squandered away and pride is humbled, when man\'s heart cries for truth in the immensity of facts and harmony in the contradiction of tendencies. Its value is not in its multiplication of materials, but in its spiritual fulfilment.","EITHER you have work or you have not. When you have to say, \\"Let us do something,\\" then begins mischief. 172","Want of love is a degree of callousness; for love is the perfection of consciousness. We do not love because we do not comprehend, or rather we do not comprehend because we do not love. For love is the ultimate meaning of everything around us. It is not a mere sentiment; it is truth; it is the joy that is at the root of all creation.","Thou art the sky and thou art the nest as well. O thou beautiful, there in the nest is thy love that encloses the soul with colours and sounds and odours. There comes the morning with the golden basket in her right hand bearing the wreath of beauty, silently to crown the earth. And there comes the evening over the lonely meadows deserted by herds, through trackless paths, carrying cool draughts of peace in her golden pitcher from the western ocean of rest. But there, where spreads the infinite sky for the soul to take her flight in, reigns the stainless white radiance. There is no day nor night, nor form nor colour, and never, never a word.","The current of the world has its boundaries, otherwise it could have no existence, but its purpose is not shown in the boundaries which restrain it, but in its movement, which is towards perfection. The wonder is not that there should be obstacles and sufferings in this world, but that there should be law and order, beauty and joy, goodness and love. The idea of God that man has in his being is the wonder of all wonders. He has felt in the depths of his life that what appears as imperfect is the manifestation of the perfect; just as a man who has an ear for music realises the perfection of a song, while in fact he is only listening to a succession of notes. Man has found out the great paradox that what is limited is not imprisoned within its limits; it is ever moving, and therewith shedding its finitude every moment. In fact, imperfection is not a negation of perfectness; finitude is not contradictory to infinity: they are but completeness manifested in parts, infinity revealed within bounds.","You cannot go on violating these laws in the name of your nation, yet enjoy their advantage as individuals.","As in intellectual error, so in evil of any other form, its essence is impermanence, for it cannot accord with the whole. Every moment it is being corrected by the totality of things and keeps changing its aspect.","The food which I get by begging is divine.\\" After I had thought over what she said, I understood her meaning. When we get our food precariously as alms, we remember God the giver. But when we receive our food regularly at home, as a matter of course, we are apt to regard it as ours by right.","black eyes need no translating; the mind itself throws a shadow upon them. In them thought opens or shuts, shines forth or goes out in darkness, hangs steadfast like the setting moon or like the swift and restless lightning illumines all quarters of the sky. They who from birth have had no other speech than the trembling of their lips learn a language of the eyes, endless in expression, deep as the sea, clear as the heavens, wherein play dawn and sunset, light and shadow. The","When I go alone at night\\"When I go alone at night to mylove-tryst, birds do not sing, the winddoes not stir, the houses on both sidesof the street stand silent.It is my own anklets that grow loudat every step and I am ashamed.When I sit on my balcony and listenfor his footsteps, leaves do not rustleon the trees, and the water is still inthe river like the sword on the kneesof a sentry fallen asleep.It is my own heart that beats wildly--I do not know how to quiet it.When my love comes and sits bymy side, when my body trembles andmy eyelids droop, the night darkens,the wind blows out the lamp, and theclouds draw veils over the stars.It is the jewel at my own breastthat shines and gives light. I do notknow how to hide it.","Os meus sonhos s\xe3o pirilampos - pontos de luz viva cintilando na escurid\xe3o.","Women lose their delicacy and refinement, when they are compelled night and day to haggle with their destiny over things pitifully small, and for this they are blamed by those whom their toil supports.","The worst form of bondage is the bondage of dejection, which keeps men hopelessly chained in loss of faith in themselves. We have been repeatedly told, with some justification, that Asia lives in the past,\u2014it is like a rich mausoleum which displays all its magnificence in trying to immortalize the dead. It was said of Asia that it could never move in the path of progress, its face was so inevitably turned backwards. We accepted this accusation, and came to believe it. In India, I know, a large section of our educated community, grown tired of feeling the humiliation of this charge against us, is trying all its resources of self-deception to turn it into a matter of boasting. But boasting is only a masked shame, it does not truly believe in itself.","Life as a whole never takes death seriously. It laughs, dances and plays, it builds, hoards and loves in death\'s face. Only when we detach one individual fact of death do we see its blankness and become dismayed. We lose sight of the wholeness of a life of which death is part. It is like looking at a piece of cloth through a microscope. It appears like a net; we gaze at the big holes and shiver in imagination. But the truth is, death is not the ultimate reality. It looks black, as the sky looks blue; but it does not blacken existence, just as the sky does not leave its stain upon the wings of the bird.","My flower, seek not thy paradise\\tin a fool\u2019s buttonhole.","Roots are branches in the earth. Branches are roots in the air.","Consciously or unconsciously, I may have done many things that were un-true, but I have never uttered anything false in my poetry \u23af that is the sanctuary where the deepest truths of my life find refuge.","Hands cling to hands and eyes linger on eyes: thus begins therecord of our hearts.","Once we dreamt that we were strangers.We wake up to find that we were dear to each other.","A mere knowledge of things can be had in a short enough time, but their spirit can only be acquired by centuries of training and self-control. Dominating nature from outside is a much simpler thing than making her your own in love\'s delight, which is a work of true genius. Your race has shown that genius, not by acquirements, but by creations; not by display of things, but by manifestation of its own inner being.","She who ever had remained in the depth of my being, in the twilight of gleams and of glimpses; she who never opened her veils in the morning light, will be my last gift to thee, my God, folded in my final song. Words have wooed yet failed to win her; persuasion has stretched to her its eager arms in vain. I have roamed from country to country keeping her in the core of my heart, and around her have risen and fallen the growth and decay of my life. Over my thoughts and actions, my slumbers and dreams, she reigned yet dwelled alone and apart. many a man knocked at my door and asked for her and turned away in despair. There was none in the world who ever saw her face to face, and she remained in her loneliness waiting for thy recognition","Languor is upon your heart and the slumber is still on your eyes. Has not the word come to you that the flower is reigning in splendour among thorns? Wake, oh awaken! let not the time pass in vain! At the end of the stony path, in the country of virgin solitude, my friend is sitting all alone. Deceive him not. Wake, oh awaken! What if the sky pants and trembles with the heat of the midday sun---what if the burning sand spreads its mantle of thirst--- Is there no joy in the deep of your heart?

I was alone by the well where the shadow of the tree fell aslant, and the women had gone home with their brown earthen pitchers full to the brim. They called me and shouted, `Come with us, the morning is wearing on to noon.\' But I languidly lingered awhile lost in the midst of vague musings. I heard not thy steps as thou camest. Thine eyes were sad when they fell on me; thy voice was tired as thou spokest low---`Ah, I am a thirsty traveller.\' I started up from my day-dreams and poured water from my jar on thy joined palms. The leaves rustled overhead; the cuckoo sang from the unseen dark, and perfume of babla flowers came from the bend of the road. I stood speechless with shame when my name thou didst ask. Indeed, what had I done for thee to keep me in remembrance? But the memory that I could give water to thee to allay thy thirst will cling to my heart and enfold it in sweetness. The morning hour is late, the bird sings in weary notes, neem leaves rustle overhead and I sit and think and think.","Yet it is at this very age when, in his heart of hearts, a young lad most craves for recognition and love; and he becomes the devoted slave of any one who shows him consideration. But none dare openly love him, for that would be regarded as undue indulgence and therefore bad for the boy. So, what with scolding and chiding, he becomes very much like a stray dog that has lost his master.","I asked nothing from thee; I uttered not my name to thine ear.

I shaded it with my cloak to save it from the wind, that is why the lamp went out. Why did the flower fade? I pressed it to my heart with anxious love, that is why the flower faded. Why did the stream dry up? I put a dam across it to have it for my use, that is why the stream dried up. Why did the harp-string break? I tried to force a note that was beyond its power, that is why the harp-string is broken.","we long for things not because they are great in themselves, but because our greed exaggerates them and makes them appear great.","I thought I should ask of thee---but I dared not---the rose wreath thou hadst on thy neck. Thus I waited for the morning, when thou didst depart, to find a few fragments on the bed. And like a beggar I searched in the dawn only for a stray petal or two. Ah me, what is it I find? What token left of thy love? It is no flower, no spices, no vase of perfumed water. It is thy mighty sword, flashing as a flame, heavy as a bolt of thunder. The young light of morning comes through the window and spread itself upon thy bed. The morning bird twitters and asks, `Woman, what hast thou got?\' No, it is no flower, nor spices, nor vase of perfumed water---it is thy dreadful sword.

We thought that the last guest had arrived for the night and the doors in the village were all shut. Only some said the king was to come. We laughed and said `No, it cannot be!\' It seemed there were knocks at the door and we said it was nothing but the wind. We put out the lamps and lay down to sleep. Only some said, `It is the messenger!\' We laughed and said `No, it must be the wind!\' There came a sound in the dead of the night. We sleepily thought it was the distant thunder. The earth shook, the walls rocked, and it troubled us in our sleep. Only some said it was the sound of wheels. We said in a drowsy murmur, `No, it must be the rumbling of clouds!\' The night was still dark when the drum sounded. The voice came `Wake up! delay not!\' We pressed our hands on our hearts and shuddered with fear. Some said, `Lo, there is the king\'s flag!\' We stood up on our feet and cried `There is no time for delay!\' The king has come---but where are lights, where are wreaths? Where is the throne to seat him? Oh, shame! Oh utter shame! Where is the hall, the decorations? Someone has said, `Vain is this cry!

But make me the gardener of your flower garden. QUEEN. What will your duties be? SERVANT. The service of your idle days. I will keep fresh the grassy path where you walk in the morning, where your feet will be greeted with praise at every step by the flowers eager for death. I will swing you in a swing among the branches of the saptaparna, where the early evening moon will struggle to kiss your skirt through the leaves.

From the trees, where the cicalas chirped, to the quiet stars there was nothing but signs and gestures, weeping and sighing. And in the deep mid-noon, when the boatmen and fisher-folk had gone to their dinner, when the villagers slept and birds were still, when the ferry-boats were idle, when the great busy world paused in its toil and became suddenly a lonely, awful giant, then beneath the vast impressive heavens there were only dumb Nature and a dumb girl, sitting very silent,\u2014one under the spreading sunlight, the other where a small tree cast its shadow.","Un d\xeda hallar\xe9 la Vida en mi interior, el gozo que se esconde en mi vida, aunque los d\xedas confunden mi camino con el polvo de la ociosidad.He conocido sus fugaces resplandores y me han llegado rachas de su aliento que han puesto fragantes mis ideas por un instante.Un d\xeda encontrar\xe9 fuera de m\xed ese gozo que me oculta la pantalla de la luz; y me alzar\xe9 en esa soledad desbordada donde todo se observa como lo ve el creador.","If my heart is breaking \u2013 let it break!

It was owing to my own weakness that I indulged in such idolatry. I was too greedy. I created an angel of Bimala, in order to exaggerate my own enjoyment. But Bimala is what she is. It is preposterous to expect that she should assume the role of an angel for my pleasure.

This charm like light, is a force. Intangible, imponderable though it be, the strivings of our intellect may not attain fruition if deprived of its life-giving touch. The nourishment which the tree draws though its root may be classified and measured, - not so the vitality which is the gift of the sunlight, and without which its functioning becomes altogether impossible. This ineffable emanation of woman\u2018s nature has, from the first, played its part in the creation of man, unobtrusively but inevitably Had man\u2018s mind not been energised by the inner working of woman\u2018s vital charm, he would never have attained his successes. Of all the higher achievements of civilization - the devotion of the toiler, the valour of the brave, the creations of the artist \u2013 the secret spring is to be found in woman\u2018s influence. In the clash and battle of primitive civilization, the action of woman\u2018s shakti is not clearly manifest; but, as civilization becomes spiritual in the course of its development, and the union of man with man is acknowledged to be more important than the differences between them, the charm of woman gets the opportunity to become the predominant factor. Such spiritual civilization can only be upheld if the emotion of woman and the intellect of man are contributed in usual shares for its purposes. Then their respective contributions may combine gloriously in ever-frsh creations, and their difference will no longer make for inequality. Woman, let me repeat, has two aspects, - in one she is the Mother, in the other, the Beloved. I have already spoken of the spiritual endeavour that characterises the first, viz., the striving, not merely for giving birth to her child, but for creating the best possible child \u2013 not as an addition to the number of men, but as one of the heroic souls who may win the victory of man\u2018s eternal fight against evil in his social life and natural surroundings. As the Beloved, it is woman\u2018s part to infuse life into all aspirations of man; and the spiritual power that enables her to do so I have called charm, and was known in India by the name shakti. There is a poem called Ananda lahari\xa0 (The stream of Delight), attributed to Shankaracharya. She who is glorified therein is the Shakti in the heart of the Universe; the Giver of Joy, the Inspirer of Activity. On the one hand, we know and use the world; on the other we are related to it by tie of disinterested joy. We can know the world because it is a manifestation of Truth: we rejoice in it because it is an expression of Joy. \u201eWho would have striven for life\u201c says the Rishi, \u201eif this ananda had not filled the sky?\u201c It seems to me that the \u201eIntellectual Beauty\u201c, whose praises Shelley has sung, is identical with this Ananda. And it is this ananda which the poet of Ananda lahari has visualised as the woman; that is to say, in his view, this Universal Shakti is manifest in human society in the nature of Woman. In this manifestation is her charm. Let no one confuse this shakti with mere \u201esweetness\u201c, for in this charm there is a combination of several qualities \u2013 patience, self-abnegation- sensitive intelligence, grace in thought, word and behaviour \u2013 the reticent expression of rhythmic life, the tendernes and terribleness of love; at its core, moreover, is that self-radiant Spirit of Delight which ever gives itself up. This shakti, this joy-giving power of woman as the Beloved, has up to now largely been dissipated by the greed of man, who has sought to use it for the purposes of his individual enjoyment, corrupting it, confining it, like his property, within jealously-guarded limits. That has also obstructed for woman herself her inward realization of the full glory of her own shakti. Her personality has been insulted at every turn by being made to display its power of delectation within a circumsribed arena.","Let your life lightly dance on the edges of Time like dew on the tip of a leaf. -Rabindranath Tagore","I shall die again and again to know that life is inexhaustible.","To the Goddess?

My mind really wants to be busy, but in making the attempt it knocks so repeatedly against the crowd as to become utterly frenzied and to keep buffeting me, its cage, from within. If only it is allowed a little leisurely solitude, and can look about and think to its heart\'s content, it will express its feelings to its own satisfaction.This freedom of solitude is what my mind is fretting for; it would be alone with its imaginings, as the Creator broods over His own creation.","AednikSu p\xe4rivad silmad on kurvad.

It is not an end in itself, as joy is. To meet with it is to know that it has no part in the true permanence of creation. It is what error is in our intellectual life. To go through the history of the development of science is to go through the maze of mistakes it made current at different times. Yet no one really believes that science is the one perfect mode of disseminating mistakes. The progressive ascertainment of truth is the important thing to remember in the history of science, not its innumerable mistakes. Error, by its nature, cannot be stationary; it cannot remain with truth; like a tramp, it must quit its lodging as soon as it fails to pay its score to the full.","implored","I surely know my pride will go to the wall, my life will burst its bonds in exceeding pain, and my empty heart will sob out in music like a hollow reed, and the stone will melt in tears.","The question is, In what manner do we accept this world, which is a perfect gift of joy? Have we been able to receive it in our heart where we keep enshrined things that are of deathless value to us? We are frantically busy making use of the forces of the universe to gain more and more power; we feed and we clothe ourselves from its stores, we scramble for its riches, and it becomes for us a field of fierce competition. But were we born for this, to extend our proprietary rights over this world and make of it a marketable commodity? When our whole mind is bent only upon making use of this world it loses for us its true value. We make it cheap by our sordid desires; and thus to the end of our days we only try to feed upon it and miss its truth, just like the greedy child who tears leaves from a precious book and tries to swallow them.","Ours is truly a God-forsaken country. Difficult, indeed, is it for us to maintain the strength of will to do. We get no help in any real sense. There is no one, within miles of us, in converse with whom we might gain an accession of vitality. No one near seems to be thinking, or feeling, or working. Not a soul has any experience of big striving, or of really and truly living. They all eat and drink, do their office work, smoke and sleep, and chatter nonsensically. When they touch upon emotion they grow sentimental, when they reason they are childish. One yearns for a full-blooded, sturdy, and capable personality; these are all so many shadows, flitting about, out of touch with the world.","All statistics consist of our attempts to represent statistically what is in motion; and in the process things assume a weight in our mind which they have not in reality. For this reason a man, who by his profession is concerned with any particular aspect of life, is apt to magnify its proportions; in laying undue stress upon facts he loses his hold upon truth. A detective may have the opportunity of studying crimes in detail, but he loses his sense of their relative places in the whole social economy. When science collects facts to illustrate the struggle for existence that is going on in the kingdom of life, it raises a picture in our minds of \\"nature red in tooth and claw.\\" But in these mental pictures we give a fixity to colours and forms which are really evanescent.","In this world of human affairs there is no worse nuisance than a boy at the age of fourteen. He is neither ornamental nor useful. It is impossible to shower affection on him as on a little boy; and he is always getting in the way. If he talks with a childish lisp he is called a baby, and if he answers in a grown-up way he is called impertinent. In fact any talk at all from him is resented.","But when the physical appearance evades the scrutiny of our senses and enters the sanctuary of our hearts, then it can forget itself. I know, from my childhood\'s experience, how devotion is beauty itself, in its inner aspect.","We had known the hordes of Moghals and Pathans who invaded India, but we had known them as human races, with their own religions and customs, likes and dislikes,\u2014we had never known them as a nation. We loved and hated them as occasions arose; we fought for them and against them, talked with them in a language which was theirs as well as our own, and guided the destiny of the Empire in which we had our active share. But this time we had to deal, not with kings, not with human races, but with a nation\u2014we, who are no nation ourselves.","El mismo caudal de vida que corre, d\xeda y noche, por mis venas, corre por el mundo y danza en comp\xe1s r\xedtmico. Es la misma vida que salta de gozo por el polvo de la tierra, en innumerables briznas de yerba, que irrumpe en tumultuosas olas de hojas y de flores. Es la misma vida que la cuna del mar mece, creciendo y bajando, del nacimiento a la muerte. Y siento que mi cuerpo se glorifica al contacto de este universo de vida; y me lleno de orgullo, porque el latido de la vida de todos los siglos danza en este instante en mi sangre","From my heart comes out and dances the image of my own desire.The gleaming vision flits on.I try to clasp it firmly, it eludes me and leads me astray.I seek what I cannot get, I get what I do not seek.","The civilizations evolved in India or China, Persia or Judaea, Greece or Rome, are like several mountain peaks having different altitude, temperature, flora and fauna, and yet belonging to the same chain of hills. There are no absolute barriers of communication between them; their foundation is the same and they affect the meteorology of an atmosphere which is common to us all. This is at the root of the meaning of the great teacher who said he would not seek his own salvation if all men were not saved; for we all belong to a divine unity, from which our great-souled men have their direct inspiration; they feel it immediately in their own personality, and they proclaim in their life, \u201cI am one with the Supreme, with the Deathless, with the Perfect.\u201d","Eyes see only dust and earth, but feel with the heart, and know pure joy.The delights blossom on all sides in every form, but where is your heart\'s thread to make a wreath of them?My master\'s flute sounds through all things, drawing me out of my lodgings wherever they may be, and while I listen I know that every step I take is in my master\'s house.For he is the sea, he is the river that leads to the sea, and he is the landing-place.","Only those of tranquil minds, and none else, can attain abiding joy, by realising within their souls the Being who manifests one essence in a multiplicity of forms.","For life is immortal youthfulness, and it hates age that tries to clog its movements - age that belongs not to life in truth, but follows it as the shadow follows the lamp.Our life, like a river, strikes its banks not to find itself closed in by them, but to realise anew every moment that it has its unending opening towards the sea. It is a poem that strikes its metre at every step not to be silenced by its rigid regulations, but to give expression every moment to the inner freedom of its harmony.","I am the boat, you are the sea, and also the boatman.Though you never make the shore, though you let me sink, why should I be foolish and afraid?Is reaching the shore a greater prize than losing myself with you?If you are only the haven, as they say, then what is the sea?Let it surge and toss me on its waves, I shall be content.I live in you whatever and however you appear.Save me or kill me as you wish, only never leave me in other hands.","Esc\xfachame, t\xfa, a quien no conozco pero que lees estos versos m\xedos con cien a\xf1os ya de existencia:No puedo regalarte ni una flor de entre todas las que prodiga la primavera, ni una luz tan s\xf3lo de estas nubes doradas.

And I must confess that, though I say I don\u2019t accept all this, in practice if I don\u2019t go by the calendar I feel uncomfortable,\u2014our atmosphere breeds fear just as it breeds malaria, so I can\u2019t shake off that kind of feeling.","There is a Persian story which I was greatly taken with when I read it as a boy \u23af I think I understood, even then, something of the underlying idea, though I was a mere child. To show the illusory character of time, a faquir put some magic water into a tub and asked the King to take a dip. The King no sooner dipped his head in than he found himself in a strange country by the sea, where he spent a good long time going through a variety of happenings and doings. He married, had children, his wife and children died, he lost all his wealth, and as he writhed under his sufferings he suddenly found himself back in the room, surrounded by his courtiers. On his proceeding to revile the faquir for his misfortunes, they said: \u201cBut, Sire, you have only just dipped your head in, and raised it out of the water!\\"The whole of our life with its pleasures and pains is in the same way enclosed in one moment of time. However long or intense we may feel it to be while it lasts, as soon as we have finished our dip in the tub of the world, we shall find how like a slight, momentary dream the whole thing has been. . . .","I have looked on this picture in many a month of March when the mustard is in bloom \u2014 this lazy line of the water and the grey of the sand beyond, the rough path along the river-bank carrying the comradeship of the field into the heart of the village.I have tried to capture in rhyme the idle whistle of the wind, the beat of the oar-strokes from a passing boat.I have wondered in my mind how simply it stands before me, this great world: with what fond and familiar ease it fills my heart, this encounter with the Eternal Stranger.","Wer B\xe4ume setzt, obwohl er wei\xdf, dass er nie in ihrem Schatten sitzen wird, hat zumindest angefangen, den Sinn des Lebens zu begreifen.","In the evening after they have brought their cattle home, they sit on the grass before their huts to know that you are among them unseen, to repeat in their songs the name which they have fondly given you.While kings\' crowns shine and disappear like falling stars, around village huts your name rises through the still night from the simple hearts of your lovers whose names are unrecorded.","The emptiness left by easy joys, untasted, is ever growing in my life. And the day may come when I shall feel that, could I but have the past back, I would strive no more after the unattainable, but drain to the full these little, unsought, everyday joys which life offers.","I cannot tell why this heart languishes in silence.It is for small needs it never asks, or knows or remembers.","If things did not move on and vanish, we should see no beauty anywhere.If youth had only the heat of movement, it would get parched and withered. But there is ever the hidden tear, which keeps it fresh.The cry of the world is not only \\"I have,\\" but also \\"I give.\\" In the first dawning light of creation, \\"I have\\" was wedded to \\"I give.\\" If this bond of union were to snap, then everything would go to ruin.","When and WhyWhen I bring you coloured toys, my child, I understand why there is such a play of coulours on clouds, on water, and why flowers are painted in tints\u2014when I give coloured toys to you, my child.\\tWhen I sing to make you dance, I truly know why there is music in leaves, and why waves send their chorus of voices to the ehart of the listening earth\u2014when I sing to make you dance.\\tWhen I bring sweet things to your greedy hands, I know why there is honey in the cup of the flower, and why fruits are secretly filled with sweet juice\u2014when I bring sweet things to your greedy hands.\\tWhen I kiss your face to make you smile, my darling, I surely understand what pleasure streams from the sky in morning light, and what delight the summer breeze brings to my body\u2014when I kiss you to make you smile.\u201d","their power till they are not only reasonably free from the tyranny of Nature and human neighbours, but have","What a strange tune is this, that comes out of the music of Spring.It seems like the tune of yellow leaves. Spring has stored up its tears in secret for us all this while.It was afraid we should not understand it, because we were so youthful.It wanted to beguile us with smiles.But we shall sleep our hearts tonight in the sadness of the other shore.","Lest I should know you too easily, you play with me.\\tYou blind me with flashes of laughter to hide your tears.\\tI know, I know your art,\\tYou never say the word you would.\\tLest I should not prize you, you elude me in a thousand ways.\\tLest I should confuse you with the crowd, you stand aside.I know, I know your art,\\tYou never walk the path you would.\\tYour claim is more than that of others, that is why you are silent.\\tWith playful carelessness you avoid my gifts.\\tI know, I know your art,\\tYou never will take what you would.","One must bear in mind, that those who have the true modern spirit need not modernise, just as those who are truly brave are not braggarts. Modernism is not in the dress of the Europeans; or in the hideous structures, where their children are interned when they take their lessons; or in the square houses with flat straight wall-surfaces, pierced with parallel lines of windows, where these people are caged in their lifetime; certainly modernism is not in their ladies\' bonnets, carrying on them loads of incongruities. These are not modern, but merely European. True modernism is freedom of mind, not slavery of taste. It is independence of thought and action, not tutelage under European schoolmasters. It is science, but not its wrong application in life,\u2014a mere imitation of our science teachers who reduce it into a superstition absurdly invoking its aid for all impossible purposes. Science, when it oversteps its limits and occupies the whole region of life, has its fascination. It looks so powerful because of its superficiality,\u2014as does a hippopotamus which is very little else but physical. Science speaks of the struggle for existence, but forgets that man\'s existence is not merely of the surface. Man truly exists in the ideal of perfection, whose depth and height are not yet measured. Life based upon science is attractive to some men, because it has all the characteristics of sport; it feigns seriousness, but is not profound. When you go a-hunting, the less pity you have the better; for your one object is to chase the game and kill it, to feel that you are the greater animal, that your method of destruction is thorough and scientific. Because, therefore, a sportsman is only a superficial man,\u2014his fullness of humanity not being there to hamper him,\u2014he is successful in killing innocent life and is happy. And the life of science is that superficial life. It pursues success with skill and thoroughness, and takes no account of the higher nature of man. But even science cannot tow humanity against truth and be successful; and those whose minds are crude enough to plan their lives upon the supposition, that man is merely a hunter and his paradise the paradise of sportsman, will be rudely awakened in the midst of their trophies of skeletons and skulls.","According to the Gita, the deeds that are done solely for the sake of self fetter our soul; the disinterested action, performed for the sake of the giving up of self, is the true sacrifice. For creation itself comes of the self-sacrifice of Brahma, which has no other purpose; and therefore, in our performance of the duty which is self-sacrificing, we realize the spirit of Brahma.","Iz mojih \u0107u misli nastojati uvek sve neistine daodagnam, znaju\u0107i da si ti istina ta koja je svetlostrazuma u mom umu zapalila.Iz mog \u0107u srca nastojati uvek svako zlo da proteram i moju ljubav u cvatu sa\u010duvam, znaju\u0107i da sedi\u0161te jetvoje u najskrivenijem hramu mog srca.I u mojim \u0107u delima nastojati tebe da otkrijem,znaju\u0107i da tvoja je sila ta koja snagu mi daje da delam.","The more one lives alone on the river or in the open country, the clearer it becomes that nothing is more beautiful or great than to perform the ordinary duties of one\'s daily life simply and naturally. From the grasses in the field to the stars in the sky, each one is doing just that; and there is such profound peace and surpassing beauty in nature because none of these tries forcibly to transgress its limitations.Yet what each one does is by no means of little moment. The grass has to put forth all its energy to draw sustenance from the uttermost tips of its rootlets simply to grow where it is as grass; it does not vainly strive to become a banyan tree; and so the earth gains a lovely carpet of green. And, indeed, what little of beauty and peace is to be found in the societies of men is owing to the daily performance of small duties, not to big doings and fine talk. Perhaps because the whole of our life is not vividly present at each moment, some imaginary hope may lure, some glowing picture of a future, untrammelled with everyday burdens, may tempt us; but these are illusory.","For man\'s struggle for existence is to exist in the fullness of his nature,\u2014not by curtailing all that is best in him and dwarfing his existence itself, but by accepting all the responsibilities of his spiritual life, even through death and defeat. I do not for a moment suggest, that Japan should be unmindful of acquiring modern weapons of self-protection. But this should never be allowed to go beyond her instinct of self-preservation. She must know that the real power is not in the weapons themselves, but in the man who wields those weapons; and when he, in his eagerness for power, multiplies his weapons at the cost of his own soul, then it is he who is in even greater danger than his enemies.","At the start of CreationThere was a dark without origin,At the breaking of CreationThere is fire without end...","Stand before my eyes, and let thy glance touch my songs into a flame.Stand among thy stars and let me find kindled in their lights my own fir of worship.The earth is waiting at the world\u2019s wayside;Stand upon the green mantle she has flung upon thy path; and let me feel in her grass and meadow flowers the spread of my own salutation.Stand in my lonely evening where my heart watches alone; fill her cup of solitude, and let me feel in me the infinity of thy love.","Rabindranath Tagore\u2019s Vision of a Free India:Where the mind is without fearand the head is held high;Where knowledge is free;Where the world has not beenbroken up into fragmentsby narrow domestic walls; \u2026Where the clear stream of reasonhas not lost its way into thedreary desert sand of dead habit; \u2026Into that heaven of freedom,my Father, let my country awake.Quoted in \\"Passage from India to America: Billionaire Engineers, Extremist Politics & Advantage to Canada & China.\\" By Ignatius Chithelen","Ah, the dear earth! The beautiful earth! She wants all that we have--the touch of our hands, the song of our hearts.She wants to draw out from us all that is within, hidden even from ourselves.This is her sorrow, that she finds out some things only to know that she has not found all. She loses before she attains.Ah, the dear earth! We shall never deceive you.(They sing.)I shall crown you with my garland, before I take leave. You ever spoke to me in all my joys and sorrows. And now, at the end of the day, my own heart will break in speech. Words came to me, but not the tune, and the song that I never sang to you remains hidden behind my tears.","The great ocean, crooning its lullaby with one unceasing melody, lapped the island to sleep with a thousand soft touches of its wave\'s white hands. The","Si lloras por haber perdido el sol, las l\xe1grimas no te dejar\xe1n ver las estrellas.","Rabindranath Tagore\u2019s Vision of a Free India:Where the mind is without fearand the head is held high;Where knowledge is free;Where the world has not beenbroken up into fragmentsby narrow domestic walls; \u2026Where the clear stream of reasonhas not lost its way into thedreary desert sand of dead habit; \u2026Into that heaven of freedom,my Father, let my country awake.Quoted in Passage from India to America: Billionaire Engineers, Extremist Politics & Advantage to Canada & China.By Ignatius Chithelen","The religion that only comes to us from external scriptures never becomes our own; our only tie with it is that of habit. To gain religion within is man\'s great lifelong adventure. In the extremity of suffering must it be born; on his life-blood it must live; and then, whether or not it brings him happiness, the man\'s journey shall end in the joy of fulfilment.","This truth has not only a subjective value, but is manifested in every department of our life. And nations who sedulously cultivate moral blindness as the cult of patriotism will end their existence in a sudden and violent death.","I lose thee, to find thee back again and again, My beloved. Thou leavest me, that I may receive thee all the more, when thou returnest. Thou canst vanish behind the moment\'s screen Only because thou art mine for evermore, My beloved.When I go in search of thee, my heart trembles, spreading ripples across my love. Thou smilest through thy disguise of utter absence, and my tears sweeten thy smile.","The general opinion of the majority of the present-day nationalists in India is that we have come to a final completeness in our social and spiritual ideals, the task of the constructive work of society having been done several thousand years before we were born, and that now we are free to employ all our activities in the political direction. We never dream of blaming our social inadequacy as the origin of our present helplessness, for we have accepted as the creed of our nationalism that this social system has been perfected for all time to come by our ancestors, who had the superhuman vision of all eternity and supernatural power for making infinite provision for future ages. Therefore, for all our miseries and shortcomings, we hold responsible the historical surprises that burst upon us from outside.","Rabindranath Tagore\u2019s Vision of a Free India:Where the mind is without fearand the head is held high;Where knowledge is free;Where the world has not beenbroken up into fragmentsby narrow domestic walls; \u2026Where the clear stream of reasonhas not lost its way into thedreary desert sand of dead habit; \u2026Into that heaven of freedom,my Father, let my country awake.Quoted in: Passage from India to America: Billionaire Engineers, Extremist Politics & Advantage to Canada & China. By Ignatius Chithelen","But now, where the spirit of the Western civilisation prevails, the whole people is being taught from boyhood, to foster hatreds and ambitions by all kinds of means,\u2014by the manufacture of half-truths and untruths in history, by persistent misrepresentation of other races and the culture of unfavourable sentiments towards them, by setting up memorials of events, very often false, which for the sake of humanity should be speedily forgotten, thus continually brewing evil menace towards neighbours and nations other than their own. This is poisoning the very fountain-head of humanity. It is discrediting the ideals, which were born of the lives of men, who were our greatest and best. It is holding up gigantic selfishness as the one universal religion for all nations of the world. We can take anything else from the hands of science, but not this elixir of moral death. Never think for a moment, that the hurts you inflict upon other races will not infect you, and the enmities you sow around your homes will be a wall of protection to you for all time to come. To imbue the minds of a whole people with an abnormal vanity of its own superiority, to teach it to take pride in its moral callousness and ill-begotten wealth, to perpetuate humiliation of defeated nations by exhibiting trophies won from war, and using these in schools in order to breed in children\'s minds contempt for others, is imitating the West where she has a festering sore, whose swelling is a swelling of disease eating into its vitality.","We may not know exactly what is happening: we do not know exactly even about a speck of dust. But when we feel the flow of life in us to be one with the universal life outside, then all our pleasures and pains are seen strung upon one long thread of joy. The facts: I am, I move, I grow, are seen in all their immensity in connection with the fact that everything else is there along with me, and not the tiniest atom can do without me.","That I exist is a perpetual surprise","Come and rejoice, for April is awake. Fling yourselves into the flood of being, bursting the bondage of the past. April is awake. Life\'s shoreless sea is heaving in the sun before you. All the losses are lost, and death is drowned in its waves.Plunge into the deep without fear, with the gladness of April in your heart.","But if you could for a time wipe out all the poets and all their poetry from the world, then you would soon discover, by their very absence, where the men of action got their energy from, and who really supplied the life-sap to their harvest-field. It is not those who have plunged deep down into the Pundit\'s Ocean of Renunciation, nor those who are always clinging to their possessions; it is not those who have become adepts in turning out quantities of work, nor those who are ever telling the dry beads of duty,--it is not these who win at last. But it is those who love, because they live. These truly win, for they truly surrender. They accept pain with all their strength and with all their strength they remove pain. It is they who create, because they know the secret of true joy, which is the secret of detachment.","When we were young, we understood all sweet things; and we could detect the sweets of a fairy story by an unerring science of our own. We never cared for such useless things as knowledge. We only cared for truth. And","I am in my twenty-seventh year. This event keeps thrusting itself before my mind \u23af nothing else seems to have happened of late.But to reach twenty-seven \u23af is that a trifling thing? \u23af To pass the meridian of the twenties on one\'s progress towards thirty? \u23af Thirty \u23af that is to say maturity \u23af the age at which people expect fruit rather than fresh foliage. But, alas, where is the promise of fruit? As I shake my head, it still feels brimful of luscious frivolity, with not a trace of philosophy.Folk are beginning to complain: \\"Where is that which we expected of you \u23af that in hope of which we admired the soft green of the shoot? Are we to put up with immaturity for ever? It is high time for us to know what we shall gain from you. We want an estimate of the proportion of oil which the blindfold, mill turning, unbiased critic can squeeze out of you.\\" It has ceased to be possible to delude these people into waiting expectantly any longer. While I was under age they trustfully gave me credit; it is sad to disappoint them now that I am on the verge of thirty. But what am I to do? Words of wisdom will not come! I am utterly incompetent to provide things that may profit the multitude. Beyond a snatch of song, some tittle-tattle, a little merry fooling, I have been unable to advance. And as the result, those who held high hopes will turn their wrath on me; but did any one ever beg them to nurse these expectations?Such are the thoughts which assail me since one fine Bysakh morning I awoke amidst fresh breeze and light, new leaf and flower, to find that I had stepped into my twenty-seventh year.","Si tu fermes la porte \xe0 toutes les erreurs, la v\xe9rit\xe9 restera dehors"]')}}]);
