Nobody ever figures out what life is all about, and it doesn\'t matter. Explore the world. Nearly everything is really interesting if you go into it deeply enough. Work as hard and as much as you want to on the things you like to do the best. Don\'t think about what you want to be, but what you want to do. Keep up some kind of a minimum with other things so that society doesn\'t stop you from doing anything at all.","If you thought that science was certain - well, that is just an error on your part.","The first principle is that you must not fool yourself and you are the easiest person to fool.","Religion is a culture of faith; science is a culture of doubt.","It doesn\'t matter how beautiful your theory is, it doesn\'t matter how smart you are. If it doesn\'t agree with experiment, it\'s wrong.","If you can\'t explain something to a first year student, then you haven\'t really understood .","We need to teach how doubt is not to be feared but welcomed. It\'s OK to say, \\"I don\'t know.\\"","Looking back at the worst times, it always seems that they were times in which there were people who believed with absolute faith and absolute dogmatism in something. And they were so serious in this matter that they insisted that the rest of the world agree with them. And then they would do things that were directly inconsistent with their own beliefs in order to maintain that what they said was true.","Study hard what interests you the most in the most undisciplined, irreverent and original manner possible.","If you think you understand quantum mechanics, you don\'t understand quantum mechanics.","Scientific knowledge is a body of statements of varying degrees of certainty -- some most unsure, some nearly sure, none absolutely certain.","Science is the organized skepticism in the reliability of expert opinion","You have no responsibility to live up to what other people think you ought to accomplish. I have no responsibility to be like they expect me to be. It\'s their mistake, not my failing.","I learned very early the difference between knowing the name of something and knowing something.","The truth always turns out to be simpler than you thought.","The only way to deep happiness is to do something you love to the best of your ability","It does not matter who you are, or how smart you are, or what title you have, or how many of you there are, and certainly not how many papers your side has published, if your prediction is wrong then your hypothesis is wrong. Period.","I\'m smart enough to know that I\'m dumb.","Have no respect whatsoever for authority; forget who said it and instead look what he starts with, where he ends up, and ask yourself, \\"Is it reasonable?\\"","The highest forms of understanding we can achieve are laughter and human compassion.","We have this terrible struggle to try to explain things to people who have no reason to want to know.","No government has the right to decide on the truth of scientific principles, nor to prescribe in any way the character of the questions investigated. Neither may a government determine the aesthetic value of artistic creations, nor limit the forms of literacy or artistic expression. Nor should it pronounce on the validity of economic, historic, religious, or philosophical doctrines. Instead it has a duty to its citizens to maintain the freedom, to let those citizens contribute to the further adventure and the development of the human race.","Physics is like sex: sure, it may give some practical results, but that\'s not why we do it.","There is no learning without having to pose a question. And a question requires doubt.","First you guess. Don\'t laugh, this is the most important step. Then you compute the consequences. Compare the consequences to experience. If it disagrees with experience, the guess is wrong. In that simple statement is the key to science. It doesn\'t matter how beautiful your guess is or how smart you are or what your name is. If it disagrees with experience, it\'s wrong. That\'s all there is to it.","The \\"paradox\\" is only a conflict between reality and your feeling of what reality \\"ought to be.\\"","We never are definitely right, we can only be sure we are wrong.","I, a universe of atoms, an atom in the universe.","To develop working ideas efficiently, I try to fail as fast as I can.","You do not know anything until you have practiced.","When a scientist doesn\'t know the answer to a problem, he is ignorant. When he has a hunch as to what the result is, he is uncertain. And when he is pretty darn sure of what the result is going to be, he is still in some doubt. We have found it of paramount importance that in order to progress we must recognize our ignorance and leave room for doubt. Scientific knowledge is a body of statements of varying degrees of certainty - some most unsure, some nearly sure, but none absolutely certain.","You can know the name of a bird in all the languages of the world, but when you\'re finished, you\'ll know absolutely nothing whatever about the bird... So let\'s look at the bird and see what it\'s doing -- that\'s what counts.","Scientists are explorers. Philosophers are tourists.","Do not read so much, look about you and think of what you see there.","You can always recognize truth by its beauty and simplicity.","We absolutely must leave room for doubt or there is no progress and no learning. There is no learning without having to pose a question. And a question requires doubt. People search for certainty. But there is no certainty.","The thing that doesn\'t fit is the thing that is most interesting.","I think it\'s much more interesting to live not knowing than to have answers which might be wrong. I have approximate answers, and possible beliefs, and different degrees of uncertainty about different things, but I am not absolutely sure of anything. There are many things I don\'t know anything about, such as whether it means anything to ask \\"Why are we here?\\" I might think about it a little bit, and if I can\'t figure it out then I go on to something else. But I don\'t have to know an answer. I don\'t feel frightened by not knowing things, by being lost in the mysterious universe without having any purpose - which is the way it really is, as far as I can tell.","I wonder why. I wonder why. I wonder why I wonder.","The test of all knowledge is experiment.","Our responsibility is to do what we can, learn what we can, improve the solutions, and pass them on.","What is not surrounded by uncertainty cannot be the truth.","Einstein was a giant. His head was in the clouds, but his feet were on the ground. But those of us who are not that tall have to choose!","Everything we know is only some kind of approximation, because we know that we do not know all the laws yet. Therefore, things must be learned only to be unlearned again or, more likely, to be corrected.","If a guy tells me the probability of failure is 1 in 100,000, I know he\'s full of crap.","Progress in science comes when experiments contradict theory.","God was invented to explain mystery. God is always invented to explain those things that you do not understand.","Teach principles not formulas.","Nobody ever figures out what life is all about, and it doesn\'t matter. Explore the world. Nearly everything is really interesting if you go into it deeply enough.","John von Neumann gave me an interesting idea: that you don\'t have to be responsible for the world that you\'re in. So I have developed a very powerful sense of social irresponsibility as a result of von Neumann\'s advice. It\'s made me a very happy man ever since. But it was von Neumann who put the seed in that grew into my active irresponsibility!","Doubt is clearly a value in science. It is important to doubt and that the doubt is not a fearful thing, but a thing of great value.","Physics is to mathematics what sex is to masturbation.","There is no harm in doubt and skepticism, for it is through these that new discoveries are made.","Work hard to find something that fascinates you.","Experiment is the sole judge of the validity of any idea.","Fall in love with some activity, and do it!

There is no learning without having to pose a question. And a question requires doubt. People search for certainty. But there is no certainty. People are terrified \u2014 how can you live and not know? It is not odd at all. You only think you know, as a matter of fact. And most of your actions are based on incomplete knowledge and you really don\u2019t know what it is all about, or what the purpose of the world is, or know a great deal of other things. It is possible to live and not know.","Observation, reason, and experiment make up what we call the scientific method.","There is no authority who decides what is a good idea.","Philosophy of science is about as useful to scientists as ornithology is to birds.","To those who do not know mathematics it is difficult to get across a real feeling as to the beauty, the deepest beauty, of nature ... If you want to learn about nature, to appreciate nature, it is necessary to understand the language that she speaks in.","Science is uncertain.","To not know math is a severe limitation to understanding the world.","I have a limited intelligence and I\'ve used it in a particular direction.","Ordinary fools are all right; you can talk to them, and try to help them out. But pompous fools-guys who are fools and are covering it all over and impressing people as to how wonderful they are with all this hocus pocus-THAT, I CANNOT STAND! An ordinary fool isn\'t a faker; an honest fool is all right. But a dishonest fool is terrible!","We are trying to prove ourselves wrong as quickly as possible, because only in that way can we find progress.","There is nothing that living things do that cannot be understood from the point of view that they are made of atoms acting according to the laws of physics.","My rule is, when you are unhappy, think about it. But when you\'re happy, don\'t. Why spoil it? You\'re probably happy for some ridiculous reason and you\'d just spoil it to know it.","Physics is not the most important thing. Love is.","Few people realize the number of things that are possible.","What did you ASK at school today?","The real question of government versus private enterprise is argued on too philosophical and abstract a basis. Theoretically, planning may be good. But nobody has ever figured out the cause of government stupidity\u2014and until they do (and find the cure), all ideal plans will fall into quicksand.","Another thing I must point out is that you cannot prove a vague theory wrong.","The inside of a computer is as dumb as hell but it goes like mad!","It\'s amazing how many people even today use a computer to do something you can do with a pencil and paper in less time.","Nature uses only the longest threads to weave her patterns, so that each small piece of her fabric reveals the organization of the entire tapestry.","Our freedom to doubt was born out of a struggle against authority in the early days of science. It was a very deep and strong struggle: permit us to question - to doubt - to not be sure. I think that it is important that we do not forget this struggle and thus perhaps lose what we have gained.","What I cannot create, I do not understand.","What Do You Care What Other People Think?","Science is what we do to keep us from lying to ourselves","I was terrible in English. I couldn\'t stand the subject. It seemed to me ridiculous to worry about whether you spelled something wrong or not, because English spelling is just a human convention--it has nothing to do with anything real, anything from nature. Any word can be spelled just as well a different way.","It is our responsibility as scientists, knowing the great progress which comes from a satisfactory philosophy of ignorance, the great progress which is the fruit of freedom of thought, to proclaim the value of this freedom; to teach how doubt is not to be feared but welcomed and discussed; and to demand this freedom as our duty to all coming generations.","Turbulence is the most important unsolved problem of classical physics.","I think it\'s much more interesting to live not knowing than to have answers which might be wrong.","We find that the statements of science are not of what is true and what is not true, but statements of what is known with different degrees of certainty: \\"It is very much more likely that so and so is true than that it is not true\\".","If an apple was magnified to the size of the Earth, then the atoms in the apple would be approximately the size of the original apple.","What do I advise? Forget it all. Don\'t be afraid. Do what you get the most pleasure from. Is it to build a cloud chamber? Then go on doing things like that. Develop your talents wherever they may lead. Damn the torpedoes - full speed ahead!If you have any talent,or any occupation that delights you,do it, and do it to the hilt","All mass is interaction.","Winning a Nobel Prize is no big deal, but winning it with an IQ of 124 is really something.","If we want to solve a problem that we have never solved before, we must leave the door to the unknown ajar.","The electron is a theory. But the theory is so good we can almost consider them real.","Mathematics is not just a language. Mathematics is a language plus reasoning.","I have a friend who\'s an artist, and he sometimes takes a view which I don\'t agree with. He\'ll hold up a flower and say, \\"Look how beautiful it is,\\" and I\'ll agree. But then he\'ll say, \\"I, as an artist, can see how beautiful a flower is. But you, as a scientist, take it all apart and it becomes dull.\\" I think he\'s kind of nutty. [...] There are all kinds of interesting questions that come from a knowledge of science, which only adds to the excitement and mystery and awe of a flower. It only adds. I don\'t understand how it subtracts.","The first principle is that you must not fool yourself\u2014and you are the easiest person to fool. So you have to be very careful about that. After you\u2019ve not fooled yourself, it\u2019s easy not to fool other scientists. You just have to be honest in a conventional way after that.","Science is a way of trying not to fool yourself.","The test of all knowledge is experiment. Experiment is the sole judge of scientific truth.","In physics the truth is rarely perfectly clear, and that is certainly universally the case in human affairs. Hence, what is not surrounded by uncertainty cannot be the truth.","Of course, you only live one life, and you make all your mistakes, and learn what not to do, and that\'s the end of you.","Don\'t think about what you want to be, but what you want to do. Keep up some kind of a minimum with other things so that society doesn\'t stop you from doing anything at all.","We are lucky to live in an age in which we are still making discoveries.","It turns out that all life is interconnected with all other life.","Victory usually goes to those green enough to underestimate the monumental hurdles they are facing.","We cannot define anything precisely. If we attempt to, we get into the paralysis of thought that comes to philosophers, who sit opposite each other, one saying to the other, \\"You don\'t know what you are talking about!\\" The second one says, \\"What do you mean by know? What do you mean by talking? What do you mean by you?\\"","So I have just one wish for you \u2013 the good luck to be somewhere where you are free to maintain the kind of integrity I have described, and where you do not feel forced by a need to maintain your position in the organization, or financial support, or so on, to lose your integrity. May you have that freedom.","For those who want some proof that physicists are human, the proof is in the idiocy of all the different units which they use for measuring energy.","There is enough energy in a single cubic meter of space to boil all the oceans in the world.","It doesn\'t seem to me that this fantastically marvelous universe, this tremendous range of time and space and different kinds of animals, and all the different planets, and all these atoms with all their motions, and so on, all this complicated thing can merely be a stage so that God can watch human beings struggle for good and evil - which is the view that religion has. The stage is too big for the drama.","All the time you\'re saying to yourself, \'I could do that, but I won\'t,\'--which is just another way of saying that you can\'t.","What I am going to tell you about is what we teach our physics students in the third or fourth year of graduate school... It is my task to convince you not to turn away because you don\'t understand it. You see my physics students don\'t understand it... That is because I don\'t understand it. Nobody does.","Maybe that is why young people make success. They don\'t know enough.","Why make yourself miserable saying things like, \\"Why do we have such bad luck? What has God done to us? What have we done to deserve this?\\" - all of which, if you understand reality and take it completely into your heart, are irrelevant and unsolvable. They are just things that nobody can know. Your situation is just an accident of life.","I was born not knowing and have had only a little time to change that here and there.","If you have any talent, or any occupation that delights you, do it, and do it to the hilt. Don\'t ask why, or what difficulties you may get into.","If the professors of English will complain to me that the students who come to the universities, after all those years of study, still cannot spell \'friend,\' I say to them that something\'s the matter with the way you spell friend.","I love to think. I once considered taking drugs as an attempt to better understand an altered state of mind; however, I decided not to. I didn\'t want to chance ruining the machine.","We are at the very beginning of time for the human race. It is not unreasonable that we grapple with problems. But there are tens of thousands of years in the future. Our responsibility is to do what we can, learn what we can, improve the solutions, and pass them on.","I learned from her that every woman is worried about her looks, no matter how beautiful she is.","One of the ways of stopping science would be only to do experiments in the region where you know the law. But experimenters search most diligently, and with the greatest effort, in exactly those places where it seems most likely that we can prove our theories wrong. In other words, we are trying to prove ourselves wrong as quickly as possible, because only in that way can we find progress.","Whenever you see a sweeping statement that a tremendous amount can come from a very small number of assumptions, you always find that it is false. There are usually a large number of implied assumptions that are far from obvious if you think about them sufficiently carefully.","A philosopher once said, \'It is necessary for the very existence of science that the same conditions always produce the same results.\' Well, they don\'t!","I don\'t know what\'s the matter with people: they don\'t learn by understanding, they learn by some other way \u2014 by rote or something. Their knowledge is so fragile!","Know how to solve every problem that has been solved.","[Quantum mechanics] describes nature as absurd from the point of view of common sense. And yet it fully agrees with experiment. So I hope you can accept nature as She is - absurd.","The only way to have real success in science, the field I\'m familiar with, is to describe the evidence very carefully without regard to the way you feel it should be. If you have a theory , you must try to explain what\'s good and what\'s bad about it equally. In science, you learn a kind of standard integrity and honesty .","Science is a way to teach how something gets to be known, what is not known, to what extent things are known (for nothing is known absolutely), how to handle doubt and uncertainty, what the rules of evidence are, how to think about things so that judgments can be made, how to distinguish truth from fraud, and from show.","The electron is a theory we use; it is so useful in understanding the way nature works that we can almost call it real.","It is surprising that people do not believe that there is imagination in science. It is a very interesting kind of imagination, unlike that of the artist. The great difficulty is in trying to imagine something that you have never seen, that is consistent in every detail with what has already been seen, and that is different from what has been thought of; furthermore, it must be definite and not a vague proposition. That is indeed difficult.","Science is a process for learning about nature in which competing ideas about how the world works are measured against observations.","Work as hard and as much as you want to on the things you like to do the best.","It is the fact that the electrons cannot all get on top of each other that makes tables and everything else solid.","If I could explain it to the average person, I wouldn\'t have been worth the Nobel Prize.","People who wish to analyze nature without using mathematics must settle for a reduced understanding.","A great deal more is known than has been proved.","So my antagonist said, \\"Is it impossible that there are flying saucers? Can you prove that it\'s impossible?\\" \\"No,\\" I said, \\"I can\'t prove it\'s impossible. It\'s just very unlikely.\\" At that he said, \\"You are very unscientific. If you can\'t prove it impossible then how can you say that it\'s unlikely?\\" But that is the way that is scientific. It is scientific only to say what is more likely and what less likely, and not to be proving all the time the possible and impossible.","Our poets do not write about it; our artists do not try to portray this remarkable thing. I don\'t know why. Is nobody inspired by our present picture of the universe? The value of science remains unsung by singers... This is not yet a scientific age.","When you get as old as I am, you start to realize that you\'ve told most of the good stuff you know to other people anyway.","There was a time when the newspapers said that only twelve men understood the theory of relativity. I do not believe there ever was such a time ... On the other hand, I think I can safely say that nobody understands quantum mechanics.","An ordinary fool isn\'t a faker; an honest fool is all right. But a dishonest fool is terrible!","There is a computer disease that anybody who works with computers knows about. It\'s a very serious disease and it interferes completely with the work. The trouble with computers is that you \'play\' with them!","For a successful technology, reality must take precedence over public relations, for Nature cannot be fooled.","There are 10^11 stars in the galaxy. That used to be a huge number. But it\'s only a hundred billion. It\'s less than the national deficit! We used to call them astronomical numbers. Now we should call them economical numbers.","We\'ve learned from experience that the truth will out.","I don\'t believe I can really do without teaching.","Science is like sex: sometimes something useful comes out, but that is not the reason we are doing it","[B]eyond poverty, beyond the point that the material needs are reasonably satisfied, only from within is peace.","We are not to tell nature what she\u2019s gotta be... She\'s always got better imagination than we have.","I don\'t feel frightened by not knowing things.","The female mind is capable of understanding analytic geometry... The difficulty may just be that we have never yet discovered a way to communicate with the female mind. If it is done in the right way, you may be able to get something out of it.","I do believe that there is a conflict between science and religion ... the spirit or attitude toward the facts is different in religion from what it is in science. The uncertainty that is necessary in order to appreciate nature is not easily correlated with the feeling of certainty in faith.","If all of mathematics disappeared, physics would be set back by exactly one week.","People often think I\'m a faker, but I\'m usually honest, in a certain way--in such a way that often nobody believes me!","Tell your son to stop trying to fill your head with science - for to fill your heart with love is enough!","Science is of value because it can produce something.","No man is rich who is unsatisfied, but who wants nothing possess his heart\'s desire.","If there is something very slightly wrong in our definition of the theories, then the full mathematical rigor may convert these errors into ridiculous conclusions.","It appears that there are enormous differences of opinion as to the probability of a failure with loss of vehicle and of human life. The estimates range from roughly 1 in 100 to 1 in 100,000. The higher figures come from the working engineers, and the very low figures from management.","I always do that, get into something and see how far I can go.","The game I play is a very interesting one. It\'s imagination, in a tight straightjacket.","[When a young person loses faith in his religion because he begins to study science and its methodology] it isn\'t that [through the obtaining of real knowledge that] he knows it all, but he suddenly realizes that he doesn\'t know it all.","Nature has a great simplicity and therefore a great beauty.","We have been led to imagine all sorts of things infinitely more marvelous than the imagining of poets and dreamers of the past. It shows that the imagination of nature is far, far greater than the imagination of man. For instance, how much more remarkable it is for us all to be stuck-half of us upside down-by a mysterious attraction, to a spinning ball that has been swinging in space for billions of years, than to be carried on the back of an elephant supported on a tortoise swimming in a bottomless sea.","I love only nature, and I hate mathematicians.","Light is something like raindrops each little lump of light is called a photon and if the light is all one color, all the \\"raindrops\\" are the same.","The real problem in speech is not precise language. The problem is clear language.","I\'m going to play with physics, whenever I want to, without worrying about any importance whatsoever.","It is simple, therefore it is beautiful","It is the facts that matter, not the proofs. Physics can progress without the proofs, but we can\'t go on without the facts ... if the facts are right, then the proofs are a matter of playing around with the algebra correctly.","When I found out that Santa Claus wasn\'t real, I wasn\'t upset; rather, I was relieved that there was a much simpler phenomenon to explain how so many children all over the world got presents on the same night! The story had been getting pretty complicated -- it was getting out of hand.","The theoretical broadening which comes from having many humanities subjects on the campus is offset by the general dopiness of the people who study these things.","Our imagination is stretched to the utmost, not, as in fiction, to imagine things which are not really there, but just to comprehend those things which are there.","Energy is a very subtle concept. It is very, very difficult to get right.","I don\'t have to be good because they think I\'m going to be good.","Some people say, \\"How can you live without knowing?\\" I do not know what they mean. I always live without knowing. That is easy. How you get to know is what I want to know.","I don\'t like honors. I\'m appreciated for the work that I did, and for people who appreciate it, and I notice that other physicists use my work. I don\'t need anything else. I don\'t think there\'s any sense to anything else.... I\'ve already got the prize. The prize is the pleasure of finding the thing out, the kick in the discovery, the observation that other people use it. Those are the real things. The honors are unreal to me. I don\'t believe in honors... I can\'t stand it, it hurts me.","It is important to realize that in physics today, we have no knowledge of what energy is","Poets say science takes away from the beauty of the stars - mere globs of gas atoms. I, too, can see the stars on a desert night, and feel them. But do I see less or more?","I believe that a scientist looking at nonscientific problems is just as dumb as the next guy.","So far as we know, all the fundamental laws of physics, like Newton\'s equations, are reversible.","You can\u2019t say A is made of B or vice versa. All mass is interaction.","When things are going well, something will go wrong. / When things just can\'t get any worse, they will. / Anytime things appear to be going better, you have overlooked something.","You say you are a nameless man. You are not to your wife and to your child. You will not long remain so to your immediate colleagues if you can answer their simple questions when they come into your office. You are not nameless to me. Do not remain nameless to yourself \u2014 it is too sad a way to be. Know your place in the world and evaluate yourself fairly, not in terms of the na\xefve ideals of your own youth, nor in terms of what you erroneously imagine your teacher\'s ideals are.","There\u2019s so much distance between the fundamental rules and the final phenomenon, that it\u2019s almost unbelievable that the final variety of phenomenon can come from such a steady operation of such simple rules.","The scale of light can be described by numbers called the frequency and as the numbers get higher, the light goes from red to blue to ultraviolet. We can\'t see ultraviolet light, but it can affect photographic plates. It\'s still light only the number is different.","But logic is not all, one needs one\'s heart to follow an idea.","The Quantum Universe has a quotation from me in every chapter - but it\'s a damn good book anyway.","The exception tests the rule.","A scientist is never certain. ... We absolutely must leave room for doubt or there is no progress and there is no learning.","Start out understanding religion by saying everything is possibly wrong... As soon as you do that, you start sliding down an edge which is hard to recover from.","I have to keep going to find out ultimately what is the matter with it in the end.","Since then I never pay attention to anything by \\"experts\\". I calculate everything myself.","Nature does not care what we call it, she just keeps on doing it.","Science is what we have learned about how to keep from fooling ourselves.","A very great deal more truth can become known than can be proven.","If I say [electrons] behave like particles I give the wrong impression; also if I say they behave like waves. They behave in their own inimitable way, which technically could be called a quantum mechanical way. They behave in a way that is like nothing that you have seen before.","No problem is too small or too trivial if we can really do something about it.","I don\'t feel frightened by not knowing things, by being lost in the mysterious universe without any purpose - which is the way it really is, as far as I can tell. Possibly. It doesn\'t frighten me.","Just as a poet often has license from the rules of grammar and pronunciation, we should like to ask for \'physicists\' license from the rules of mathematics in order to express what we wish to say in as simple a manner as possible.","When you\'re thinking about something that you don\'t understand, you have a terrible, uncomfortable feeling called confusion... Now, is the confusion\'s because we\'re all some kind of apes that are kind of stupid working against this, trying to figure out [how] to put the two sticks together to reach the banana and we can\'t quite make it... So I always feel stupid. Once in a while, though, the sticks go together on me and I reach the banana.","I think I can safely say that nobody understands Quantum Mechanics.","The difficulty really is psychological and exists in the perpetual torment that results from your saying to yourself, \\"But how can it be like that?\\" which is a reflection of uncontrolled but utterly vain desire to see it in terms of something familiar. ... If you will simply admit that maybe Nature does behave like this, you will find her a delightful, entrancing thing. Do not keep saying to yourself, if you can possible avoid it, \\"But how can it be like that?\\" because you will get \'down the drain\', into a blind alley from which nobody has escaped. Nobody knows how it can be like that.","Learn what the rest of the world is like. The variety is worthwhile.","But there is nothing in biology yet found that indicates the inevitability of death.","I am not interested in what today\'s mathematicians find interesting.","Science alone of all the subjects contains within itself the lesson of the danger of belief in the infallibility of the greatest teachers of the preceding generation.","We have found it of paramount importance that in order to progress, we must recognize our ignorance and leave room for doubt.","To guess what to keep and what to throw away takes considerable skill. Actually it is probably merely a matter of luck, but it looks as if it takes considerable skill.","In its efforts to learn as much as possible about nature, modern physics has found that certain things can never be \\"known\\" with certainty. Much of our knowledge must always remain uncertain. The most we can know is in terms of probabilities.","To test whether you have learned an idea or a definition, rephrase what you just learned without using the new word.","All we know so far is what doesn\'t work.","There are all kinds of interesting questions that come from a knowledge of science, which only adds to the excitement and mystery and awe of a flower.","(Joan,1941) She wrote me a letter asking,\\"How can I read it?,Its so hard.\\" I told her to start at the beginning and read as far as you can get until you\'re lost. Then start again at the beginning and keep working through until you can understand the whole book. And thats what she did","In any organization there ought to be the possibility of discussion... fence sitting is an art, and it\'s difficult, and it\'s important to do, rather than to go headlong in one direction or the other. It\'s just better to have action, isn\'t it than to sit on the fence? Not if you\'re not sure which way to go, it isn\'t.","I think, however, that there isn\'t any solution to this problem of education other than to realize that the best teaching can be done only when there is a direct individual relationship between a student and a good teacher - a situation in which the student discusses the ideas, thinks about the things, and talks about the things. It\'s impossible to learn very much by simply sitting in a lecture, or even by simply doing problems that are assigned. But in our modern times we have so many students to teach that we have to try to find some substitute for the ideal.","In fact, the science of thermodynamics began with an analysis, by the great engineer Sadi Carnot, of the problem of how to build the best and most efficient engine, and this constitutes one of the few famous cases in which engineering has contributed to fundamental physical theory. Another example that comes to mind is the more recent analysis of information theory by Claude Shannon. These two analyses, incidentally, turn out to be closely related.","If you know that you are not sure, you have a chance to improve the situation. I want to demand this freedom for future generations.","The unanswerable mysteries... the attitude that all is uncertain... to summarize it - the humility of the intellect.","Nature isn\'t classical, dammit, and if you want to make a simulation of nature, you\'d better make it quantum mechanical, and by golly it\'s a wonderful problem, because it doesn\'t look so easy.","A poet once said, \\"The whole universe is in a glass of wine.\\" We will probably never know in what sense he meant that, for poets do not write to be understood... How vivid is the claret, pressing its existence into the consciousness that watches it! If our small minds, for some convenience, divide this glass of wine, this universe, into parts - physics, biology, geology, astronomy, psychology, and so on - remember that nature does not know it! So let us put it all back together, not forgetting ultimately what it is for. Let it give us one more final pleasure: drink it and forget it all!","Don\'t worry about anything. Go out and have a good time.","The same equations have the same solutions","Everything is made of atoms.","If you can find any other view of the world which agrees over the entire range where things have already been observed, but disagrees somewhere else, you have made a great discovery.","If you don\'t like it, go somewhere else, to another universe where the rules are simpler.","Nature\'s imagination far surpasses our own.","A person talks in such generalities that everyone can understand him and it\'s considered to be some deep philosophy. However, I would like to be very rather more special and I would like to be understood in an honest way, rather than in a vague way.","The most important thing I found out from my father is that if you asked any question and pursued it deeply enough, then at the end there was a glorious discovery of a general and beautiful kind.","It is odd, but on the infrequent occasions when I have been called upon in a formal place to play the bongo drums, the introducer never seems to find it necessary to mention that I also do theoretical physics.","Another of the qualities of science is that it teaches the value of rational thought, as well as the importance of freedom of thought; the positive results that come from doubting that all the lessons are true... Learn from science that you must doubt the experts. As a matter of fact, I can also define science another way: Science is the belief in the ignorance of experts.","It does not make any difference how beautiful your guess is. It does not make any difference how smart you are, who made the guess, or what his name is if it disagrees with experiment it is wrong. That is all there is to it.","I have the advantage of having found out how hard it is to get to really know something. How careful you have to be about checking your experiments. How easy it is to make mistakes and fool yourself. I know what it means to know something.","It is our responsibility to leave the people of the future a free hand.","I have to disregard everybody else, and then I can do my own work.","The fact that you are not sure means that it is possible that there is another way someday.","Words can be meaningless. If they are used in such a way that no sharp conclusions can be drawn.","It is in the admission of ignorance and the admission of uncertainty that there is a hope for the continuous motion of human beings in some direction that doesn\'t get confined, permanently blocked, as it has so many times before in various periods in the history of man.","What I can\'t create I don\'t understand","As you know, a theory in physics is not useful unless it is able to predict underlined effects which we would otherwise expect.","The idea that no one really knew how to run a government led to the idea that we should arrange a system by which new ideas could be developed, tried out, and tossed out if necessary, with\\nmore new ideas brought in - a trial and error system.","Know your place in the world and evaluate yourself fairly, not in terms of the na\xefve ideals of your own youth, nor in terms of what you erroneously imagine your teacher\'s ideals are.","You see, the chemists have a complicated way of counting: instead of saying \\"one, two, three, four, five protons\\", they say, \\"hydrogen, helium, lithium, beryllium, boron.\\"","To do any important work in physics a very good mathematical ability and aptitude are required. Some work in applications can be done without this, but it will not be very inspired. If you must satisfy your \\"personal curiosity concerning the mysteries of nature\\" what will happen if these mysteries turn out to be laws expressed in mathematical terms (as they do turn out to be)? You cannot understand the physical world in any deep or satisfying way without using mathematical reasoning with facility.","Today\'s brains are yesterday\'s mashed potatoes.","You know how it always is, every new idea, it takes a generation or two until it becomes obvious that there\'s no real problem. It has not yet become obvious to me that there\'s no real problem. I cannot define the real problem, therefore I suspect there\'s no real problem, but I\'m not sure there\'s no real problem.","That is the logical tight-rope on which we have to walk if we wish to interpret nature.","You see, one thing is, I can live with doubt and uncertainty and not knowing. I have approximate answers and possible beliefs and different degrees of certainty about different things... It doesn\'t frighten me.","There is nothing in biology yet found that indicates the inevitability of death. This suggests to me that it is not at all inevitable and that it is only a matter of time before biologists discover what it is that is causing us the trouble.","All theoretical chemistry is really physics; and all theoretical chemists know it.","This attitude of mind - this attitude of uncertainty - is vital to the scientist, and it is this attitude of mind which the student must first acquire. It becomes a habit of thought. Once acquired, we cannot retreat from it anymore.","Strange! I don\'t understand how it is that we can write mathematical expressions and calculate what the thing is going to do without being able to picture it.","Philosophers say a great deal about what is absolutely necessary for science, and it is always, so far as one can see, rather naive, and probably wrong.","I don\'t believe I can really do without teaching. The reason is, I have to have something so that when I don\'t have any ideas and I\'m not getting anywhere, I can say to myself, \\"At least I\'m living; at least I\'m doing something. I\'m making some contribution.\\" It\'s just psychological.","Poets say science takes away from the beauty of stars-mere globs of gas atoms.  Nothing is \\"mere\\".  I too see the stars on a desert night, and feel them.  But do I see less or more? ...What is the pattern, or the meaning, or the why?  It does not do harm to the mystery to know a little more about it.  For far more marvelous is the truth than any artists of the past imagined it.","There are theoretical physicists who imagine, deduce, and guess at new laws, but do not experiment; and then there are experimental physicists who experiment, imagine, deduce, and guess.","There in wine is found the great generalization: all life is fermentation.","Although it is uncertain, it is necessary to make science useful. Science is only useful if it tells you about some experiment that has not been done; it is not good if it only tells you what just went on.","In fact the total amount that a physicist knows is very little. He has only to remember the rules to get him from one place to another and he is all right.","My friends and I had taken dancing lessons, although none of us would ever admit it. In those depression days, a friend of my mother was trying to make a living by teaching dancing in the evening, in an upstairs dance studio. There was a back door to the place, and she arranged it so the young men could come up through the back way without being seen.","This is not very important what I\'m doing. I\'m just proving something.","There are thousands of years in the past, and there is an unknown amount of time in the future. There are all kinds of opportunities, and there are all kinds of dangers.","I find that teaching and the students keep life going, and I would never accept any position in which somebody has invented a happy situation for me where I don\'t have to teach. Never.","Therefore psychologically we must keep all the theories in our heads, and every theoretical physicist who is any good knows six or seven different theoretical representations for exactly the same physics.","We have a habit in writing articles published in scientific journals to make the work as finished as possible, to cover up all the tracks, to not worry about the blind alleys or describe how you had the wrong idea first, and so on. So there isn\'t any place to publish, in a dignified manner, what you actually did in order to get to do the work, although, there has been in these days, some interest in this kind of thing.","I don\'t like honors. ... I\'ve already got the prize: the prize is the pleasure of finding the thing out, the kick in the discovery, the observation that other people use it. Those are the real things.","\'Conservation\' (the conservation law) means this ... that there is a number, which you can calculate, at one moment-and as nature undergoes its multitude of changes, this number doesn\'t change. That is, if you calculate again, this quantity, it\'ll be the same as it was before. An example is the conservation of energy: there\'s a quantity that you can calculate according to a certain rule, and it comes out the same answer after, no matter what happens, happens.","I think we can safely assume that no one understands quantum mechanics.","You can recognize truth by its beauty and simplicity. When you get it right, it is obvious that it is right -- at least if you have any experience -- because usually what happens is that more comes out than goes in.","Nature...cannot be fooled!","If science is to progress, what we need is the ability to experiment, honesty in reporting results\u2014the results must be reported without somebody saying what they would like the results to have been\u2014and finally\u2014an important thing\u2014the intelligence to interpret the results.","If you\'re doing an experiment, you should report everything that you think might make it invalid - not only what you think is right about it; other causes that could possibly explain your results; and things you thought of that you\'ve eliminated by some other experiment, and how they worked  -to make sure the other fellow can tell they have been eliminated.","The beauty that is there is also available for me, too. But I see a deeper beauty that isn\'t so readily available to others.... I don\'t see how studying a flower ever detracts from its beauty. It only adds","The game I play is a very interesting one. It\'s imagination in a straightjacket, which is this: that it has to agree with the known laws of physics. ... It requires imagination to think of what\'s possible, and then it requires an analysis back, checking to see whether it fits, whether its allowed, according to what\'s known, okay?","When a scientist doesn\'t know the answer to a problem, he is ignorant. When he has a hunch as to what the result is, he is uncertain. And when he is pretty darn sure of what the result is going to be, he is in some doubt.","It is scientific only to say what is more likely and what less likely, and not to be proving all the time the possible and impossible.","You see, I get such fun out of thinking that I don\'t want to destroy this most pleasant machine that makes life such a big kick.","... it is impossible to explain honestly the beauties of the laws of nature in a way that people can feel, without their having some deep understanding of mathematics. I am sorry, but this seems to be the case.","I\'d hate to die twice. It\'s so boring.","What we need is imagination, but imagination in a terrible strait-jacket.","It is impossible, by the way, when picking one example of anything, to avoid picking one which is atypical in some sense.","Agnostic for me would be trying to weasel out and sound a little nicer than I am about this.","The principle of science, the definition, almost, is the following: The test of all knowledge is experiment. Experiment is the sole judge of scientific \\"truth.\\" But what is the source of knowledge? Where do the laws that are to be tested come from? Experiment, itself, helps to produce these laws, in the sense that it gives us hints. But also needed is imagination to create from these hints the great generalizations--to guess at the wonderful, simple, but very strange patterns beneath them all, and then to experiment to check again whether we have made the right guess.","The idea is to try to give all the information to help others to judge the value of your contribution; not just the information that leads to judgment in one particular direction or another.","Every instrument that has been designed to be sensitive enough to detect weak light has always ended up discovering that the same thing: light is made of particles.","The shell game that we play ... is technically called \'renormalization\'. But no matter how clever the word, it is still what I would call a dippy process! Having to resort to such hocus-pocus has prevented us from proving that the theory of quantum electrodynamics is mathematically self-consistent. It\'s surprising that the theory still hasn\'t been proved self-consistent one way or the other by now; I suspect that renormalization is not mathematically legitimate.","There\'s plenty of room at the bottom.","The fundamental principle of science, the definition almost, is this: the \\nsole test of the validity of any idea is experiment.","This is not yet a scientific age.","Scientific views end in awe and mystery, lost at the edge in uncertainty, but they appear to be so deep and so impressive that the theory that it is all arranged as a stage for God to watch man\'s struggle for good and evil seems inadequate.","If you keep proving stuff that others have done, getting confidence, increasing the complexities of your solutions - for the fun of it - then one day you\'ll turn around and discover that nobody actually did that one! And that\'s the way to become a computer scientist.","I have argued flying saucers with lots of people. I was interested in possible. They do not appreciate that the problem is not to demonstrate whether it\'s possible or not but whether it\'s going on or not.","When it came time for me to give my talk on the subject, I started off by drawing an outline of the cat and began to name the various muscles. The other students in the class interrupt me: \\"We *know* all that!\\" \\"Oh,\\" I say, \\"you *do*? Then no *wonder* I can catch up with you so fast after you\'ve had four years of biology.\\" They had wasted all their time memorizing stuff like that, when it could be looked up in fifteen minutes.","If you thought you were trying to find out more about it because you\'re gonna get an answer to some deep philosophical question...you may be wrong! It may be that you can\'t get an answer to that particular question by finding out more about the character of nature. But my interest in science is to simply find out about the world.","It\'s because somebody knows something about it that we can\'t talk about physics. It\'s the things that nobody knows anything about we can discuss.","If we will only allow that, as we progress, we remain unsure, we will leave opportunities for alternatives.","But the real glory of science is that we can find a way of thinking such that the law is evident.","So this piece of dirt waits four and a half billion years and evolves and changes, and now a strange creature stands here with instruments and talks to the strange creatures in the audience. What a wonderful world!","When a photon comes down, it interacts with electrons throughout the glass, not just on the surface. The photon and electrons do some kind of dance, the net result of which is the same as if the photon hit only on the surface.","Outside of their particular area of expertise scientists are just as dumb as the next person.","The other thing that gives a scientific man the creeps in the world today are the methods of choosing leaders - in every nation. Today, for example, in the United States, the two political parties have decided to employ public relations men, that is, advertising men, who are trained in the necessary methods of telling the truth or lying in order to develop a product.","Once we were driving in the midwest and we pulled into a McDonald\'s. Someone came up to me and asked me why I have Feynman diagrams all over my van. I replied, \\"Because I am Feynman!\\" The young man went, \\"Ahhhhh!\\"","I am a successful lecturer in physics for popular audiences. The real entertainment gimmick is the excitement, drama and mystery of the subject matter. People love to learn something, they are \'entertained\' enormously by being allowed to understand a little bit of something they never understood before. One must have faith in the subject and in people\'s interest in it.","I think a power to do something is of value. Whether the result is a good thing or a bad thing depends on how it is used, but the power is a value.","I couldn\'t claim that I was smarter than sixty-five other guys--but the average of sixty-five other guys, certainly!","I think Nature\'s imagination is so much greater than man\'s, she\'s never gonna let us relax!","Some things that satisfy the rules of algebra can be interesting to mathematicians even though they don\'t always represent a real situation.","Physicists like to think that all you have to do is say, these are the conditions, now what happens next?","As usual, nature\'s imagination far surpasses our own, as we have seen from the other theories which are subtle and deep.","All things are made of atoms - little particles that move around in perpetual motion, attracting each other when they are a little distance apart, but repelling upon being squeezed into one another. In that one sentence, you will see, there is an enormous amount of information about the world, if just a little imagination and thinking are applied.","I learned a lot of different things from different schools. MIT is a very good place\u2026. It has developed for itself a spirit, so that every member of the whole place thinks that it\u2019s the most wonderful place in the world\u2014it\u2019s the center, somehow, of scientific and technological development in the United States, if not the world \u2026 and while you don\u2019t get a good sense of proportion there, you do get an excellent sense of being with it and in it, and having motivation and desire to keep on","Some people think Wheeler\'s gotten crazy in his later years, but he\'s always been crazy.","People are always asking for the latest developments in the unification of this theory with that theory, and they don\'t give us a chance to tell them anything about what we know pretty well. They always want to know the things we don\'t know.","No! Not for a second! I immediately began to think how this could have happened. And I realized that the clock was old and was always breaking. That the clock probably stopped some time before and the nurse coming in to the room to record the time of death would have looked at the clock and jotted down the time from that. I never made any supernatural connection, not even for a second. I just wanted to figure out how it happened.","We can deduce, often, from one part of physics like the law of gravitation, a principle which turns out to be much more valid than the derivation.","One does not, by knowing all the physical laws as we know them today, immediately obtain an understanding of anything much. I love only nature, and I hate mathematicians.","This is the key of modern science and is the beginning of the true understanding of nature. This idea. That to look at the things, to record the details, and to hope that in the information thus obtained, may lie a clue to one or another of a possible theoretical interpretation.","It is going to be necessary that everything that happens in a finite volume of space and time would have to be analyzable with a finite number of logical operations. The present theory of physics is not that way, apparently. It allows space to go down into infinitesimal distances, wavelengths to get infinitely great, terms to be summed in infinite order, and so forth; and therefore, if this proposition [that physics is computer-simulatable] is right, physical law is wrong.","So, ultimately, in order to understand nature it may be necessary to have a deeper understanding of mathematical relationships. But the real reason is that the subject is enjoyable, and although we humans cut nature up in different ways, and we have different courses in different departments, such compartmentaliz ation is really artificial, and we should take our intellectual pleasures where we find them.","I can live with doubt and uncertainty and not knowing. I think it is much more interesting to live not knowing than to have answers that might be wrong. If we will only allow that, as we progress, we remain unsure, we will leave opportunities for alternatives. We will not become enthusiastic for the fact, the knowledge, the absolute truth of the day, but remain always uncertain \u2026 In order to make progress, one must leave the door to the unknown ajar.","The basis of action on love, the brotherhood of all men, the value of the individual... the humility of the spirit.","During the Middle Ages there were all kinds of crazy ideas, such as that a piece of rhinoceros horn would increase potency.  Then a method was discovered for separating the ideas - which was to try one to see if it worked, and if it didn\'t work, to eliminate it.  This method became organized, of course, into science.","The work I have done has, already, been adequately rewarded and recognized. Imagination reaches out repeatedly trying to achieve some higher level of understanding, until suddenly I find myself momentarily alone before one new corner of nature\'s pattern of beauty and true majesty revealed. That was my reward.","One cannot understand... the universality of laws of nature, the relationship of things, without an understanding of mathematics. There is no other way to do it.","The problem of creating something new, but which is consistent with everything which has been seen before, is one of extreme difficulty.","If all of this, all the life of a stream of water, can be nothing but a pile of atoms, how much more is possible?","To decide upon the answer is not scientific.  In order to make progress, one must leave the door to the unknown ajar ajar only.","Unless a thing can be defined by measurement, it has no place in a theory. And since an accurate value of the momentum of a localized particle cannot be defined by measurement it therefore has no place in the theory.","While I am describing to you how Nature works, you won\'t understand why Nature works that way. But you see, nobody understands that.","The world is a dynamic mess of jiggling things","Computer science is not as old as physics; it lags by a couple of hundred years. However, this does not mean that there is significantly less on the computer scientist\'s plate than on the physicist\'s: younger it may be, but it has had a far more intense upbringing!","But see that the imagination of nature is far, far greater than the imagination of man.","Science is a way for us to not fool ourselves.","We decided that \'trivial\' means \'proved\'. So we joked with the mathematicians: We have a new theorem- that mathematicians can prove only trivial theorems, because every theorem that\'s proved is trivial.","From a long view of the history of mankind the most significant event of the nineteenth century will be judged as Maxwell\'s discovery of the laws of electrodynamics.","You should not fool the laymen when you\'re talking as a scientist... . I\'m talking about a specific, extra type of integrity that is not lying, but bending over backwards to show how you\'re maybe wrong, [an integrity] that you ought to have when acting as a scientist. And this is our responsibility as scientists, certainly to other scientists, and I think to laymen.","Only realistic flight schedules should be proposed, schedules that have a reasonable chance of being met. If in this way the government would not support them, then so be it. NASA owes it to the citizens from whom it asks support to be frank, honest, and informative.","When the problem [quantum chromodynamics] is finally solved, it will all be by imagination. Then there will be some big thing about the great way it was done. But it\'s simple -it will all be by imagination, and persistence.","The worthwhile problems are the ones you can really solve or help solve, the ones you can really contribute something to... No problem is too small or too trivial if we can really do something about it.","As revealed by physics, the truth is so remarkable, so amazing!","I\'m trying to find out NOT how Nature could be, but how Nature IS.","We scientists are clever \u2014 too clever \u2014 are you not satisfied? Is four square miles in one bomb not enough? Men are still thinking. Just tell us how big you want it!","I am going to tell you what nature behaves like. If you will simply admit that maybe she does behave like this, you will find her a delightful, entrancing thing. Do not keep saying to yourself, if you can possibly avoid it, \'But how can it be like that?\' ...Nobody knows how it can be like that.","For far more marvelous is the truth than any artists of the past imagined it. Why do the poets of the present not speak of it? What men are poets who can speak of Jupiter if he were a man, but if he is an immense spinning sphere of methane and ammonia must be silent?","Ordinarily it would take me about fifteen minutes to get a hallucination going,\\" wrote Feynman, \\"but on a few occasions, when I smoked some marijuana beforehand, it came very quickly.","Mathematics is a language plus reasoning. It\'s like a language plus logic. Mathematics is a tool for reasoning.","What would happen if we could arrange the atoms one by one the way we want them?","Listen, I mean that from my knowledge of the world that I see around me, I think that it is much more likely that the reports of flying saucers are the results of the known irrational characteristics of terrestrial intelligence than of the unknown rational efforts of extra-terrestrial intelligence.","It is necessary for the very existence of science that minds exist which do not allow that nature must satisfy some preconceived conditions.","Thank you very Much, I enjoyed myself","If it disagrees with experiment, it\'s wrong.","On the contrary, it\'s because somebody knows something about it that we can\'t talk about physics . It\'s the things that nobody knows anything about that we can discuss. We can talk about the weather; we can talk about social problems; we can talk about psychology; we can talk about international finance gold transfers we can\'t talk about, because those are understood so it\'s the subject that nobody knows anything about that we can all talk about!","Thus we can get the correct answer for the probability of partial reflection by imagining (falsely) that all reflection comes from only the front and back surfaces. In this intuitively easy analysis, the \'front surface\' and \'back surface\' arrows are mathematical constructions that give us the right answer, whereas .... a more accurate representation of what is really going on: partial reflection is the scattering of light by electrons inside the glass.","Phenomena complex-laws simple....Know what to leave out.","Scientific knowledge is an enabling power to do either good or bad \u2014 but it does not carry instructions on how to use it.","In a way, the Nobel Prize has been something of a pain in the neck, though there was at least one time that I got some fun out of it, Shortly after I won the Prize, Gweneth and I received an invitation from the Brazilian government to be the guests of honor at the Carnaval celebrations in Rio.","It is to be emphasized that no matter how many [amplitude] arrows we draw, add, or multiply, our objective is to calculate a single final arrow for the event . Mistakes are often made by physics students at first because they do not keep this important point in mind. They work for so long analyzing events involving a single photon that they begin to think that the arrow is somehow associated with the photon [rather than with the event].","The whole question of imagination in science is often misunderstood by people in other disciplines. ... They overlook the fact that whatever we are allowed to imagine in science must be consistent with everything else we know.","By honest I don\'t mean that you only tell what\'s true. But you make clear the entire situation. You make clear all the information that is required for somebody else who is intelligent to make up their mind.","No one really understands quantum mechanics.","What is the fundamental hypothesis of science, the fundamental philosophy? We stated it in the first chapter: the sole test of the validity of any idea is experiment. ... If we are told that the same experiment will always produce the same result, that is all very well, but if when we try it, it does not, then it does not. We just have to take what we see, and then formulate all the rest of our ideas in terms of our actual experience.","There is one simplification at least. Electrons behave ... in exactly the same way as photons; they are both screwy, but in exactly in the same way.","Everybody who reasons carefully about anything is making a contribution ... and if you abstract it away and send it to the Department of Mathematics they put it in books.","We\'ve learned from experience that the truth will out. Other experimenters will repeat your experiment and find out whether you were wrong or right. Nature\'s phenomena will agree or they\'ll disagree with your theory. And, although you may gain some temporary fame and excitement, you will not gain a good reputation as a scientist if you haven\'t tried to be very careful in this kind of work. And it\'s this type of integrity, this kind of care not to fool yourself, that is missing to a large extent in much of the research in Cargo Cult Science.","We are very lucky to be living in an age in which we are still making discoveries. It is like the discovery of America-you only discover it once. The age in which we live is the age in which we are discovering the fundamental laws of nature, and that day will never come again. It is very exciting, it is marvelous, but this excitement will have to go.","It is not unscientific to make a guess, although many people who are not in science think it is.","From a long view of the history of mankind, seen from, say, ten thousand years from now, there can be little doubt that the most significant event of the 19th century will be judged as Maxwell\'s discovery of the laws of electrodynamics. The American Civil War will pale into provincial insignificance in comparison with this important scientific event of the same decade.","Any schemes - such as \'think of symmetry laws\', or \'put the information in mathematical form\', or \'guess equations\'- are known to everybody now, and they are all tried all the time. When you are stuck, the answer cannot be one of these, because you will have tried these right away...The next scheme, the new discovery, is going to be made in a completely different way.","It requires a much higher degree of imagination to understand the electromagnetic field than to understand invisible angels. ... I speak of the E and B fields and wave my arms and you may imagine that I can see them ... [but] I cannot really make a picture that is even nearly like the true waves.","I don\'t think that the laws can be considered to be like God because they have been figured out.","The chance is high that the truth lies in the fashionable direction. But, on the off-chance that it is in another direction - a direction obvious from an unfashionable view of field theory - who will find it? Only someone who has sacrificed himself by teaching himself quantum electrodynamics from a peculiar and unusual point of view; one that he may have to invent for himself.","A poet once said, \\"The whole universe is in a glass of wine.\\" We will probably never know in what sense he meant that, for poets do not write to be understood. But it is true that if we look at a glass of wine closely enough we see the entire universe.","When a Caltech student asked the eminent cosmologist Michael Turner what his \\"bias\\" was in favoring one or another particle as a likely candidate to compromise dark matter in the universe, Feynmann snapped, \\"Why do you want to know his bias? Form your own bias!\\"","In those days, in Far Rockaway, there was a youth center for Jewish kids at the temple.... Somebody nominated me for president of the youth center. The elders began getting nervous, because I was an avowed atheist by that time.... I thought nature itself was so interesting that I didn\'t want it distorted like that. And so I gradually came to disbelieve the whole religion.","The present situation in physics is as if we know chess, but we don\'t know one or two rules.","People may come along and argue philosophically that they like one better than another; but we have learned from much experience that all philosophical intuitions about what nature is going to do fail.","What is necessary for \'the very existence of science,\' and what the characteristics of nature are, are not to be determined by pompous preconditions, they are determined always by the material with which we work, by nature herself. We look, and we see what we find, and we cannot say ahead of time successfully what it is going to look like. ... It is necessary for the very existence of science that minds exist which do not allow that nature must satisfy some preconceived conditions.","I have a friend who\'s an artist and has sometimes taken a view which I don\'t agree with very well. He\'ll hold up a flower and say \\"look how beautiful it is,\\" and I\'ll agree. Then he says \\"I as an artist can see how beautiful this is but you as a scientist take this all apart and it becomes a dull thing,\\" and I think that he\'s kind of nutty. First of all, the beauty that he sees is available to other people and to me too, I believe. Although I may not be quite as refined aesthetically as he is ... I can appreciate the beauty of a flower. At the same time, I see much more about the flower than he sees. I could imagine the cells in there, the complicated actions inside, which also have a beauty. I mean it\'s not just beauty at this dimension, at one centimeter; there\'s also beauty at smaller dimensions, the inner structure, also the processes. The fact that the colors in the flower evolved in order to attract insects to pollinate it is interesting; it means that insects can see the color. It adds a question: does this aesthetic sense also exist in the lower forms? Why is it aesthetic? All kinds of interesting questions which the science knowledge only adds to the excitement, the mystery and the awe of a flower. It only adds. I don\'t understand how it subtracts.","I... a universe of atoms, an atom in the universe.","I think it\'s much more interesting to live not knowing than to have answers which might be wrong. I have approximate answers and possible beliefs and different degrees of uncertainty about different things, but I am not absolutely sure of anything and there are many things I don\'t know anything about, such as whether it means anything to ask why we\'re here. I don\'t have to know an answer. I don\'t feel frightened not knowing things, by being lost in a mysterious universe without any purpose, which is the way it really is as far as I can tell.","Physics isn\'t the most important thing.

But it is true that if we look at a glass of wine closely enough we see the entire universe. There are the things of physics: the twisting liquid which evaporates depending on the wind and weather, the reflection in the glass; and our imagination adds atoms. The glass is a distillation of the earth\'s rocks, and in its composition we see the secrets of the universe\'s age, and the evolution of stars. What strange array of chemicals are in the wine? How did they come to be? There are the ferments, the enzymes, the substrates, and the products. There in wine is found the great generalization; all life is fermentation. Nobody can discover the chemistry of wine without discovering, as did Louis Pasteur, the cause of much disease. How vivid is the claret, pressing its existence into the consciousness that watches it! If our small minds, for some convenience, divide this glass of wine, this universe, into parts -- physics, biology, geology, astronomy, psychology, and so on -- remember that nature does not know it! So let us put it all back together, not forgetting ultimately what it is for. Let it give us one more final pleasure; drink it and forget it all!","All the time you\'re saying to yourself, \'I could do that, but I won\'t,\' \u2014 which is just another way of saying that you can\'t.","Physics is to math what sex is to masturbation.","Poets say science takes away from the beauty of the stars - mere globs of gas atoms. I too can see the stars on a desert night, and feel them. But do I see less or more?

What is the pattern, or the meaning, or the why? It does not do harm to the mystery to know a little about it. For far more marvelous is the truth than any artists of the past imagined it. Why do the poets of the present not speak of it?

It\'s a very serious disease and it interferes completely with the work. The trouble with computers is you *play* with them. They are so wonderful. You have these switches - if it\'s an even number you do this, if it\'s an odd number you do that - and pretty soon you can do more and more elaborate things if you are clever enough, on one machine.After a while the whole system broke down. Frankel wasn\'t paying any attention; he wasn\'t supervising anybody. The system was going very, very slowly - while he was sitting in a room figuring out how to make one tabulator automatically print arc-tangent X, and then it would start and it would print columns and then bitsi, bitsi, bitsi, and calculate the arc-tangent automatically by integrating as it went along and make a whole table in one operation.Absolutely useless. We *had* tables of arc-tangents. But if you\'ve ever worked with computers, you understand the disease - the *delight* in being able to see how much you can do. But he got the disease for the first time, the poor fellow who invented the thing.","I wanted very much to learn to draw, for a reason that I kept to myself: I wanted to convey an emotion I have about the beauty of the world. It\'s difficult to describe because it\'s an emotion. It\'s analogous to the feeling one has in religion that has to do with a god that controls everything in the whole universe: there\'s a generality aspect that you feel when you think about how things that appear so different and behave so differently are all run \\"behind the scenes\\" by the same organization, the same physical laws. It\'s an appreciation of the mathematical beauty of nature, of how she works inside; a realization that the phenomena we see result from the complexity of the inner workings between atoms; a feeling of how dramatic and wonderful it is. It\'s a feeling of awe \u2014 of scientific awe \u2014 which I felt could be communicated through a drawing to someone who had also had this emotion. It could remind him, for a moment, of this feeling about the glories of the universe.","Quantum mechanics describes nature as absurd from the point of view of common sense.

When this objective view is finally attained, and the mystery and majesty of matter are fully appreciated, to then turn the objective eye back on man viewed as matter, to view life as part of this universal mystery of greatest depth, is to sense an experience which is very rare, and very exciting. It usually ends in laughter and a delight in the futility of trying to understand what this atom in the universe is, this thing\u2014atoms with curiosity\u2014that looks at itself and wonders why it wonders. Well, these scientific views end in awe and mystery, lost at the edge in uncertainty, but they appear to be so deep and so impressive that the theory that it is all arranged as a stage for God to watch man\'s struggle for good and evil seems inadequate.  Some will tell me that I have just described a religious experience. Very well, you may call it what you will. Then, in that language I would say that the young man\'s religious experience is of such a kind that he finds the religion of his church inadequate to describe, to encompass that kind of experience.

It is not unreasonable that we grapple with problems. But there are tens of thousands of years in the future. Our responsibility is to do what we can, learn what we can, improve the solutions, and pass them on. It is our responsibility to leave the people of the future a free hand. In the impetuous youth of humanity, we can make grave errors that can stunt our growth for a long time. This we will do if we say we have the answers now, so young and ignorant as we are. If we suppress all discussion, all criticism, proclaiming \u201cThis is the answer, my friends; man is saved! we will doom humanity for a long time to the chains of authority, confined to the limits of our present imagination. It has been done so many times before.It is our responsibility as scientists, knowing the great progress which comes from a satisfactory philosophy of ignorance, the great progress which is the fruit of freedom of thought, to proclaim the value of this freedom; to teach how doubt is not to be feared but welcomed and discussed; and to demand this freedom as our duty to all coming generations.\u201d","Finally, I said that I couldn\u2019t see how anyone could be educated by this self-propagating system in which people pass exams, and teach others to pass exams, but nobody knows anything.","Some people say, How can you live without knowing?

If it disagrees with experiment, it is wrong. In that simple statement is the key to science.

The idea that no one really knew how to run a government led to the idea that we should arrange a system by which new ideas could be developed, tried out, and tossed out if necessary, with more new ideas bought in - a trial-and-error system. This method was a result of the fact that science was already showing itself to be a successful venture at the end of the eighteenth century. Even then it was clear to socially minded people that the openness of possibilities was an opportunity, and that doubt and discussion were essential to progress into the unknown. If we want to solve a problem that we have never solved before, we must leave the door to the unknown ajar...doubt is not to be feared, but welcomed and discussed.","When I tried to show him how an electromagnet works by making a little coil of wire and hanging a nail on a piece of string, I put the voltage on, the nail swung into the coil, and Jerry said, \u201cOoh!

I was accused of being anti-women because of two stories: the first was a discussion of the subtleties of velocity, and involved a woman driver being stopped by a cop. There\'s a discussion about how fast she was going, and I had her raise valid objections to the cop\'s definitions of velocity. The letter said I was making the women look stupid. The other story they objected to was told by the great astronomer Arthur Eddington, who had just figured out that the stars get their power from burning hydrogen in a nuclear reaction producing helium. He recounted how, on the night after his discovery, he was sitting on a bench with his girlfriend. She said, \\"Look how pretty the stars shine!\\" To which he replied, \\"Yes, and right now, I\'m the only man in the world who knows how they shine.\\" He was describing a kind of wonderful loneliness you have when you make a discovery. The letter claimed that I was saying a women is incapable of understanding nuclear reactions. I figured there was no point in trying to answer their accusations in detail, so I wrote a short letter back to them: \\"Don\'t bug me, Man!","My father had the spirit and integrity of a scientist, but he was a salesman.

Not attack by the method of cutting off the heads of the people, but attack in the sense of discuss. I believe that we should demand that people try in their own minds to obtain for themselves a more consistent picture of their own world; that they not permit themselves the luxury of having their brain cut in four pieces or two pieces even, and on one side they believe this and on the other side they believe that, but never try to compare the two points of view. Because we have learned that, by trying to put the points of view that we have in our head together and comparing one to the other, we make some progress in understanding and in appreciating where we are and what we are. And I believe that science has remained irrelevant because we wait until somebody asks us questions or until we are invited to give a speech on Einstein\u2019s theory to people who don\u2019t understand Newtonian mechanics, but we never are invited to give an attack on faith healing, or on astrology \u2014 on what is the scientific view of astrology today.","I learned from my father to translate: everything I read I try to figure out what it really means, what it\u2019s really saying.","There were a lot of fools at that conference\u2014pompous fools\u2014and pompous fools drive me up the wall.

When a scientist doesn\u2019t know the answer to a problem, he is ignorant. When he has a hunch as to what the result is, he is uncertain. And when he is pretty damn sure of what the result is going to be, he is still in some doubt. We have found it of paramount importance that in order to progress, we must recognize our ignorance and leave room for doubt. Scientific knowledge is a body of statements of varying degrees of certainty \u2014 some most unsure, some nearly sure, but none absolutely certain. Now, we scientists are used to this, and we take it for granted that it is perfectly consistent to be unsure, that it is possible to live and not know. But I don\u2019t know whether everyone realizes this is true. Our freedom to doubt was born out of a struggle against authority in the early days of science. It was a very deep and strong struggle: permit us to question \u2014 to doubt \u2014 to not be sure. I think that it is important that we do not forget this struggle and thus perhaps lose what we have gained.","Once in Hawaii I was taken to see a Buddhist temple.

I thought of how we teach physics: We have so many techniques - so many mathematical methods - that we never stop telling the students how to do things. On the other hand, the drawing teacher is afraid to tell you anything. If your lines are very heavy, the teacher can\'t say, \\"Your lines are too heavy.\\" because *some* artist has figured out a way of making great pictures using heavy lines. The teacher doesn\'t want to push you in some particular direction. So the drawing teacher has this problem of communicating how to draw by osmosis and not by instruction, while the physics teacher has the problem of always teaching techniques, rather than the spirit, of how to go about solving physical problems.","I\u2019ve found out since that such people don\u2019t know what they\u2019re doing, and get insulted when you make some suggestion or criticism.","the only thing that can be predicted is the probability of different events.","The only way to have real success in science, the field I\'m familiar with, is to describe the evidence very carefully without regard to the way you feel it should be. If you have a theory, you must try to explain what\'s good and what\'s bad about it equally. In science, you learn a kind of standard integrity and honesty.","If someone were to propose that the planets go around the sun because all planet matter has a kind of tendency for movement, a kind of motility, let us call it an \u2018oomph,\u2019 this theory could explain a number of other phenomena as well. So this is a good theory, is it not? No. It is nowhere near as good as the proposition that the planets move around the sun under the influence of a central force which varies exactly inversely as the square of the distance from the center. The second theory is better because it is so specific; it is so obviously unlikely to be the result of chance. It is so definite that the barest error in the movement can show that it is wrong; but the planets could wobble all over the place, and, according to the first theory, you could say, \u2018Well, that is the funny behavior of the \u2018oomph.","I think, however, that there isn\'t any solution to this problem of education other than to realize that the best teaching can be done only when there is a direct individual relationship between a student and a good teacher --- a situation in which the student discusses the ideas, thinks about the things, and talks about the things.","We are so used to looking at the world from the point of view of living things that we cannot understand what it means not to be alive, and yet most of the time the world had nothing alive on it. And in most places in the universe today there probably is nothing alive.","I believe, therefore, that although it is not the case today, that there may some day come a time, I should hope, when it will fully appreciated that the power of governments should be limited; that governments ought not to be empowered to decide the validity of scientific theories, that this is a ridiculous thing for them to try to do; that they are not to decide the description of history or of economic theory or of philosophy.","anything can happen, in spite of what you\u2019re pretty sure should happen.","There is a most profound and beautiful question associated with the observed coupling constant, e - the amplitude for a real electron to emit or absorb a real photon. It is a simple number that has been experimentally determined to be close to 0.08542455. (My physicist friends won\'t recognize this number, because they like to remember it as the inverse of its square: about 137.03597 with about an uncertainty of about 2 in the last decimal place. It has been a mystery ever since it was discovered more than fifty years ago, and all good theoretical physicists put this number up on their wall and worry about it.) Immediately you would like to know where this number for a coupling comes from: is it related to pi or perhaps to the base of natural logarithms? Nobody knows. It\'s one of the greatest damn mysteries of physics: a magic number that comes to us with no understanding by man. You might say the \\"hand of God\\" wrote that number, and \\"we don\'t know how He pushed his pencil.\\" We know what kind of a dance to do experimentally to measure this number very accurately, but we don\'t know what kind of dance to do on the computer to make this number come out, without putting it in secretly!","I am going to tell you what nature behaves like. If you will simply admit that maybe she does behave like this, you will find her a delightful, entrancing thing. Do not keep saying to yourself, if you can possibly avoid it, \u2018But how can it be like that?\u2019 because you will get \u2018down the drain\u2019, into a blind alley from which nobody has yet escaped. Nobody knows how it can be like that.","So our problem is to explain where symmetry comes from. Why is nature so nearly symmetrical? No one has any idea why. The only thing we might suggest is something like this: There is a gate inJapan, a gate in Neiko, which is sometimes called by the Japanesethe most beautiful gate in all Japan; it was built in a time whenthere was great influence from Chinese art. This gate is very elaborate,with lots of gables and beautiful carving and lots of columnsand dragon heads and princes carved into the pillars, and so on.But when one looks closely he sees that in the elaborate and complexdesign along one of the pillars, one of the small design elementsis carved upside down; otherwise the thing is completelysymmetrical. If one asks why this is, the story is that it was carvedupside down so that the gods will not be jealous of the perfectionof man. So they purposely put an error in there, so that the godswould not be jealous and get angry with human beings.We might like to turn the idea around and think that the trueexplanation of the near symmetry of nature is this: that God madethe laws only nearly symmetrical so that we should not be jealousof His perfection!","I suddenly remembered that Murray Gell-Mann and I were supposed to give talks at that conference on the present situation of high-energy physics. My talk was set for the plenary session, so I asked the guide, \\"Sir, where would the talks for the plenary session of the conference be?\\"\\"Back in that room that we just came through.\\"\\"Oh!\\" I said in delight. \\"Then I\'m gonna give a speech in that room!\\"The guide looked down at my dirty pants and my sloppy shirt. I realized how dumb that remark must have sounded to him, but it was genuine surprise and delight on my part. We went along a little bit farther, and the guide said, \\"This is a lounge for the various delegates, where they often hold informal discussions.\\" They were some small, square windows in the doors to the lounge that you could look through, so people looked in. There were a few men sitting there talking. I looked through the windows and saw Igor Tamm, a physicist from Russia that I know. \\"Oh!\\" I said. \\"I know that guy!\\" and I started through the door.The guide screamed, \\"No, no! Don\'t go in there!\\" By this time he was sure he had a maniac on his hands, but he couldn\'t chase me because he wasn\'t allowed to go through the door himself!","Western civilization, it seems to me, stands by two great heritages. One is the scientific spirit of adventure\u2014the adventure into the unknown, an unknown that must be recognized as unknown in order to be explored, the demand that the unanswerable mysteries of the universe remain unanswered, the attitude that all is uncertain. To summarize it: humility of the intellect.","I feel that human beings should treat human beings like human beings.","I did that once when I was a student at MIT. I got sick and tired of having to decide what kind of dessert I was going to have at the restaurant, so I decided it would always be chocolate ice cream, and never worried about it again\u2014I had the solution to that problem.","The people of Japan believed they had only one way of moving up: to have their children educated more than they were; that it was very important for them to move out of their peasantry to become educated. So there has been a great energy in the family to encourage the children to do well in school, and to be pushed forward. Because of this tendency to learn things all the time, new ideas from the outside would spread through the educational system very easily. Perhaps that is one of the reasons why Japan has advanced so rapidly.","It was a kind of one-upmanship, where nobody knows what\'s going on, and they\'d put the other one down as if they did know. They all fake that they know, and if one student admits for a moment that something is confusing by asking a question, the others take a high-handed attitude, acting as if it\'s not confusing at all, telling him that he\'s wasting their time... All the work they did, intelligent people, but they got themselves into this funny state of mind, this strange kind of self-propagating \\"education\\" which is meaningless, utterly meaningless.","Electrons, when they were first discovered, behaved exactly like particles or bullets, very simply. Further research showed, from electron diffraction experiments for example, that they behaved like waves. As time went on there was a growing confusion about how these things really behaved ---- waves or particles, particles or waves? Everything looked like both.This growing confusion was resolved in 1925 or 1926 with the advent of the correct equations for quantum mechanics. Now we know how the electrons and light behave. But what can I call it? If I say they behave like particles I give the wrong impression; also if I say they behave like waves. They behave in their own inimitable way, which technically could be called a quantum mechanical way. They behave in a way that is like nothing that you have seen before. Your experience with things that you have seen before is incomplete. The behavior of things on a very tiny scale is simply different. An atom does not behave like a weight hanging on a spring and oscillating. Nor does it behave like a miniature representation of the solar system with little planets going around in orbits. Nor does it appear to be somewhat like a cloud or fog of some sort surrounding the nucleus. It behaves like nothing you have seen before.There is one simplication at least. Electrons behave in this respect in exactly the same way as photons; they are both screwy, but in exactly in the same way\u2026.The difficulty really is psychological and exists in the perpetual torment that results from your saying to yourself, \\"But how can it be like that?\\" which is a reflection of uncontrolled but utterly vain desire to see it in terms of something familiar. I will not describe it in terms of an analogy with something familiar; I will simply describe it. There was a time when the newspapers said that only twelve men understood the theory of relativity. I do not believe there ever was such a time. There might have been a time when only one man did, because he was the only guy who caught on, before he wrote his paper. But after people read the paper a lot of people understood the theory of relativity in some way or other, certainly more than twelve. On the other hand, I think I can safely say that nobody understands quantum mechanics. So do not take the lecture too seriously, feeling that you really have to understand in terms of some model what I am going to describe, but just relax and enjoy it. I am going to tell you what nature behaves like. If you will simply admit that maybe she does behave like this, you will find her a delightful, entrancing thing. Do not keep saying to yourself, if you can possible avoid it, \\"But how can it be like that?\\" because you will get \'down the drain\', into a blind alley from which nobody has escaped. Nobody knows how it can be like that.","You see, the chemists have a complicated way of counting: instead of saying \\"one, two, three, four, five protons,\\" they say, \\"hydrogen, helium, lithium, beryllium, boron.","We are at the very beginning of time for the human race. Our responsibility is to do what we can, learn what we can, improve the solutions and pass them on. It is our responsibility to leave the men of the future a free hand. In the impetuous youth of humanity, we can make grave errors that can stunt our growth for a long time. This we will do if we say we have the answers now, so young and ignorant; if we suppress all discussion, all criticism, saying, \u2018This is it, boys, man is saved!\u2019 and thus doom man for a long time to the chains of authority, confined to the limits of our present imagination.

May be I was fooling myself. I wasn\'t delighted, but I didn\'t feel terribly upset, perhaps because we had known for a long time that it was going to happen.It\'s hard to explain. If a Martian(who, we\'ll imagine never dies except by accident) came to Earth and saw this peculiar race of creatures-these humans who live about seventy or eighty years, knowing that death is going to come--it would look to hi like a terrible problem of psychology to live under those circumstances, knowing that life is only temporary Well, we humans somehow figure out how to live despite this problem: we laugh, we joke, we live.The only difference for me and Arlene was, instead of fifty years, it was five years. It was only a quantitative difference--the psychological problem was just the same. The only way it would have become any different is if we had said to ourselves, \\"But those other people have it better, because they might live fifty years.\\" But that\'s crazy. Why make yourself miserable saying things like, \\"Why do we have such bad luck? What has God done to us? What have we done to deserve this?\\"--all of which, if you understand reality and take it completely into your heart, are irrelevant and unsolvable. They are just things that nobody can know.

There are, roughly speaking, three ways.First, there may be situations where nature has arranged, or we arrange nature, to be simple and to have so few parts that we can predict exactly what will happen, and thus we can check how our rules work. (In one corner of the board there may be only a few chess pieces at work, and that we can figure out exactly.)A second good way to check rules is in terms of less specific rules derived from them. For example, the rule on the move of a bishop on a chessboard is that it moves only on the diagonal. One can deduce, no matter how many moves may be made, that a certain bishop will always be on a red square. So, without being able to follow the details, we can always check our idea about the bishop\'s motion by finding out whether it is always on a red square. Of course it will be, for a long time, until all of a sudden we find that it is on a black square (what happened of course, is that in the meantime it was captured, another pawn crossed for queening, and it turned into a bishop on a black square). That is the way it is in physics. For a long time we will have a rule that works excellently in an over-all way, even when we cannot follow the details, and then some time we may discover a new rule. From the point of view of basic physics, the most interesting phenomena are of course in the new places, the places where the rules do not work\u2014not the places where they do work! That is the way in which we discover new rules.The third way to tell whether our ideas are right is relatively crude but prob-ably the most powerful of them all. That is, by rough approximation. While we may not be able to tell why Alekhine moves this particular piece, perhaps we can roughly understand that he is gathering his pieces around the king to protect it, more or less, since that is the sensible thing to do in the circumstances. In the same way, we can often understand nature, more or less, without being able to see what every little piece is doing, in terms of our understanding of the game.","The trouble with playing a trick on a highly intelligent man like Mr. Teller is that the time it takes him to figure out from the moment that he sees there is something wrong till he understands exactly what happened is too damn small to give you any pleasure!","If you try once or twice to communicate and get pushed back, pretty soon you decide, \u201cTo hell with it.","For a successful technology, reality must take precedence over public relations, for nature cannot be fooled.- Rogers Commission Report into the Challenger Crash, June 1986.","Take this neat little equation here. It tells me all the ways an electron can make itself comfortable in or around an atom. That\'s the logic of it. The poetry of it is that the equation tells me how shiny gold is, how come rocks are hard, what makes grass green, and why you can\'t see the wind. And a million other things besides, about the way nature works.","Trees are made of air, primarily. When they are burned, they go back to air, and in the flaming heat is released the flaming heat of the Sun which was bound in to convert the air into tree. And in the ash is the small remnant of the part which did not come from air, that came from the solid earth, instead.","The first is the matter of judging evidence\u2013well, the first thing really is, before you begin you must not know the answer. So you begin by being uncertain as to what the answer is. This is very, very important, so important that I would like to delay that aspect, and talk about that still further along in my speech. The question of doubt and uncertainty is what is necessary to begin; for if you already know the answer there is no need to gather any evidence about it.

It is interesting that the correct equations for the behavior of light were worked out by MacCullagh in 1839. But people said to him: \'Yes, but there is no real material whose mechanical properties could possibly satisfy those equations, and since light is an oscillation that must vibrate in something, we cannot believe this abstract equation business\'.","If we want to solve a problem that we have never solved before, we must leave thedoor to the unknown ajar.","We cannot predict whether a given photon will arrive at A or B. All we can predict is that out of 100 photons that come down, an average of 4 will be reflected by the front surface. Does this mean that physics, a science of great exactitude, has been reduced to calculating only the probability of an event, and not predicting exactly what will happen? Yes. That\'s a retreat, but that\'s the way it is: Nature permits us to calculate only probabilities. Yet science has not collapsed.","But if you\u2019ve ever worked with computers, you understand the disease\u2014the delight in being able to see how much you can do.","They had wasted all their time memorizing stuff like that, when it could be looked up in fifteen minutes.","I mumbled something about how it was easy to calculate e to any power using that series (you just substitute the power for x). \u201cOh yeah? they said, \u201cWell, then, what\u2019s e to the 3.3?\u201d said some joker\u2014I think it was Tukey.

This was interesting.","Are you looking for the ultimate laws of physics?\\" No, I\'m not. I\'m just looking to find out more about the world and if it turns out there is a simple ultimate law which explains everything, so be it; that would be very nice to discover.

When someone says a thing has been done scientifically, often all he means is that it has been done thoroughly. I have heard people talk of the \\"scientific\\" extermination of the Jews in Germany. There was nothing scientific about it. It was only thorough. There was no question of making observations and then checking them in order to determine something. In that sense, there were \\"scientific\\" exterminations of people in Roman times and in other periods when science was not so far developed as it is today and not much attention was paid to observation. In such cases, people should say \\"thorough\\" or \\"thoroughgoing,\\" instead of \\"scientific.","If we were not able or did not desire to look in any new direction, if we did not have a doubt or recognize ignorance, we would not get any new ideas.","The ultimate test of your knowledge is your capacity to convey it to another.","First of all there is matter\u2014and, remarkably enough, all matter is the same.

Whether the result is a good thing or a bad ting depends on how it is used, but the power is a value.","That is the idea that we all hope you have learned in studying science in school\u2014we never explicitly say what this is, but just hope that you catch on by all the examples of scientific investigation. It is interesting, therefore, to bring it out now and speak of it explicitly. It\u2019s a kind of scientific integrity, a principle of scientific thought that corresponds to a kind of utter honesty\u2014a kind of leaning over backwards. For example, if you\u2019re doing an experiment, you should report everything that you think might make it invalid\u2014not only what you think is right about it: other causes that could possibly explain your results; and things you thought of that you\u2019ve eliminated by some other experiment, and how they worked\u2014to make sure the other fellow can tell they have been eliminated.Details that could throw doubt on your interpretation must be given, if you know them. You must do the best you can\u2014if you know anything at all wrong, or possibly wrong\u2014to explain it. If you make a theory, for example, and advertise it, or put it out, then you must also put down all the facts that disagree with it, as well as those that agree with it. There is also a more subtle problem. When you have put a lot of ideas together to make an elaborate theory, you want to make sure, when explaining what it fits, that those things it fits are not just the things that gave you the idea for the theory; but that the finished theory makes something else come out right, in addition.In summary, the idea is to try to give all of the information to help others to judge the value of your contribution; not just the information that leads to judgment in one particular direction or another.The first principle is that you must not fool yourself\u2014and you are the easiest person to fool. So you have to be very careful about that. After you\u2019ve not fooled yourself, it\u2019s easy not to fool other scientists... You just have to be honest in a conventional way after that.","There are very remarkable mysteries about the fact that we\u2019re able to do so many more things than apparently animals can do, and other questions like that, but those are mysteries I want to investigate without knowing the answer to them, and so altogether I can\u2019t believe theses special stories that have been made up about our relationship to the universe at large because they seem to be too simple, too connected, too local, too provincial.","For example, there was a book that started out with four pictures: first there was a wind-up toy; then there was an automobile; then there was a boy riding a bicycle; then there was something else. And underneath each picture, it said \\"What makes it go?\\"I thought, I know what it is: They\'re going to talk about mechanics, how the springs work inside the toy; about chemistry, how the engine of an automobile works; and biology, about how the muscles work.It was the kind of thing my father would have talked about: \\"What makes it go? Everything goes because the sun is shining.\\" And then we would have fun discussing it: \\"No, the toy goes becaues the spring is wound up, I would say. \\"How did the spring get would up\\" he would ask. \\"I wound it up\\" \\"And how did you get moving?\\" \\"From eating\\" \\"And food grows only because the sun is shining. So it\'s because the sun is shining that all these things are moving\\" That would get the concept across that motion is simply the transformation of the sun\'s power.I turned the page. The answer was, for the wind-up toy, \\"Energy makes it go.\\" And for the boy on the bicycle, \\"Energy makes it go.\\" For everything \\"Energy makes it go.\\"Now that doesn\'t mean anything. Suppose it\'s \\"Wakalixes.\\" That\'s the general principle: \\"Wakalixes makes it go.\\" There is no knowledge coming in. The child doesn\'t learn anything; it\'s just a wordWhat the should have done is to look at the wind-up toy, see that there are springs inside, learn about springs, learn about wheels, and never mind \\"energy\\". Later on, when the children know something about how the toy actually works, they can discuss the more general principles of energy.It is also not even true that \\"energy makes it go\\", because if it stops, you could say, \\"energy makes it stop\\" just as well. What they\'re talking about is concentrated energy being transformed into more dilute forms, which is a very subtle aspect of energy. Energy is neither increased nor decreased in these examples; it\'s just changed from one form to another. And when the things stop, the energy is changed into heat, into general chaos.","The taxi driver felt that it was a good observation, and said he was planning to build for the future, too: he had some money on the horses, and if he won, he would buy his own taxicab, and really do well.I felt very sorry. I told him that betting on the horses was a bad idea, but he insisted it was the only way he could do it. He had such good intentions, but his method was going to be luck.I wasn\'t going to go on philosophizing, so he took me to a place where there was a steel band playing some great calypso music, and I had an enjoyable afternoon.","In learning any subject of a technical nature where mathematics plays a role, one is confronted with the task of understanding and storing away in the memory a huge body of facts and ideas, held together by certain relationships which can be \u201cproved or \u201cshown\u201d to exist between them. It is easy to confuse the proof itself with the relationship which it establishes. Clearly, the important thing to learn and to remember is the relationship, not the proof. In any particular circumstance we can either say \u201cit can be shown that\u201d such and such is true, or we can show it. In almost all cases, the particular proof that is used is concocted, first of all, in such form that it can be written quickly and easily on the chalkboard or on paper, and so that it will be as smooth-looking as possible. Consequently, the proof may look deceptively simple, when in fact, the author might have worked for hours trying different ways of calculating the same thing until he has found the neatest way, so as to be able to show that it can be shown in the shortest amount of time! The thing to be remembered, when seeing a proof, is not the proof itself, but rather that it can be shown that such and such is true. Of course, if the proof involves some mathematical procedures or \u201ctricks\u201d that one has not seen before, attention should be given not to the trick exactly, but to the mathematical idea involved.\u201d","When sunlight, which contains red, yellow, green, and blue light, shines on a mud puddle with oil on it, the areas that strongly reflect each of those colors overlap and produce all kinds of combinations which our eyes see as different colors...This phenomenon of colors produced by the partial reflection of white light by two surfaces is called iridescence, and can be found in many places...the more you see how strangely Nature behaves, the harder it is to make a model that explains how even the simplest phenomena actually work.","And then I thought to myself, \\"you know, what they think of you is so fantastic, it\'s impossible to live up to it.

We cannot,however, predict when it is going to emit the light or, with several atoms, whichone is going to. You may say that this is because there are some internal \\"wheels\\"which we have not looked at closely enough.

If we look at the moons of Jupiter we can understand everything about the way they move around that planet. Incidentally, there was once a certain difficulty with the moons of Jupiter that is worth remarking on. These satellites were studied very carefully by R\xf8mer, who noticed that the moons sometimes seemed to be ahead of schedule, and sometimes behind. (One can find their schedules by waiting a very long time and finding out how long it takes on the average for the moons to go around.) Now they were ahead when Jupiter was particularly close to the earth and they were behind when Jupiter was farther from the earth. This would have been a very difficult thing to explain according to the law of gravitation\u2014it would have been, in fact, the death of this wonderful theory if there were no other explanation. If a law does not work even in one place where it ought to, it is just wrong. But the reason for this discrepancy was very simple and beautiful: it takes a little while to see the moons of Jupiter because of the time it takes light to travel from Jupiter to the earth. When Jupiter is closer to the earth the time is a little less, and when it is farther from the earth, the time is more. This is why moons appear to be, on the average, a little ahead or a little behind, depending on whether they are closer to or farther from the earth. This phenomenon showed that light does not travel instantaneously, and furnished the first estimate of the speed of light. This was done in\xa01676.","I am always looking, like a child, for wonders I know I am going to find. Maybe not every time, but every once in a while.","You are a strong and beautiful woman.

The meaning of any statement is a subject that has interested and troubled philosophers from time immemorial, and the meaning of physical laws is even more interesting, because it is generally believed that these laws represent some kind of real knowledge. The meaning of knowledge is a deep problem in philosophy, and it is always important to ask, \u201cWhat does it mean?\u201d","I\u2019ve very often made mistakes in my physics by thinking the theory isn\u2019t as good as it really is, thinking that there are lots of complications that are going to spoil it\u2014an attitude that anything can happen, in spite of what you\u2019re pretty sure should happen.","The real problem in speech is not precise language. The problem is clear language. The desire is to have the idea clearly communicated to the other person.

It is really quite impossible to say anything with absolute precision, unless that thing is so abstracted from the real world as to not represent any real thing.","That night, Brazilian TV audiences saw the director of the Center for Physical Research welcome the Visiting Professor from the United States, but little did they know that the subject of their conversation was finding a girl to spend the night with!","Spanish\u2026then I discovered I was going to Brazil\u2026 Now I wanted to say, \u201cSo, I learned Portuguese,\u201d but I couldn\u2019t think of the word for \u201cso.\u201d I knew how to make BIG words,\u201d","Our freedom to doubt was born out of a struggle against authority in the early days of science.

And the army was always going to send this fellow they had, but he was always delayed. Now, we always were in a hurry. Everything we did, we tried to do as quickly as possible. In this particular case, we worked out all the numerical steps that the machines were supposed to do\u2014multiply this, and then do this, and subtract that. Then we worked out the program, but we didn\u2019t have any machine to test it on. So we set up this room with girls in it. Each one had a Marchant: one was the multiplier, another was the adder. This one cubed\u2014all she did was cube a number on an index card and send it to the next girl. We went through our cycle this way until we got all the bugs out. It turned out that the speed at which we were able to do it was a hell of a lot faster than the other way, where every single person did all the steps. We got speed with this system that was the predicted speed for the IBM machine. The only difference is that the IBM machines didn\u2019t get tired and could work three shifts. But the girls got tired after a while.","We cannot do it in this way for two reasons. First, we do not yet know all the basic laws: there is an expanding frontier of ignorance. Second, the correct statement of the laws of physics involves some very unfamiliar ideas which require advanced mathematics for their description.

I also looked into extrasensory perception and PSI phenomena, and the latest craze there was Uri Geller, a man who is supposed to be able to bend keys by rubbing them with his finger. So I went to his hotel room, on his invitation, to see a demonstration of both mindreading and bending keys. He didn\u2019t do any mindreading that succeeded; nobody can read my mind, I guess. And my boy held a key and Geller rubbed it, and nothing happened.

I will give you some very simple examples to show how, knowing the law of conservation of energy and the formulae for calculating energy, we can understand other laws. In other words many other laws are not independent, but are simply secret ways of talking about the conservation of energy. The simplest is the law of the lever (fig. 16). Figure 16","The question is, of course, is it going to be possible to amalgamate everything,and merely discover that this world represents different aspects of one thing?Nobody knows. All we know is that as we go along, we find that we can amalga-mate pieces, and then we find some pieces that do not fit, and we keep trying toput the jigsaw puzzle together. Whether there are a finite number of pieces, andwhether there is even a border to the puzzle, is of course unknown. It will neverbe known until we finish the picture, if ever. What we wish to do here is to see towhat extent this amalgamation process has gone on, and what the situation is atpresent, in understanding basic phenomena in terms of the smallest set of principles.To express it in a simple manner, what are things made of and how few elementsare there ?","Suppose that physics, or rather nature, is considered analogous to a great chess game with millions of pieces in it, and we are trying to discover the laws by which the pieces move. The great gods who play this chess play it very rapidly, and it is hard to watch and difficult to see. However, we are catching on to some of the rules, and there are some rules which we can work out which do not require that we watch every move. For instance, suppose there is one bishop only, a red bishop, on the board, then since the bishop moves diagonally and therefore never changes the colour of its square, if we look away for a moment while the gods play and then look back again, we can expect that there will be still a red bishop on the board, maybe in a different place, but on the same colour square. This is in the nature of a conservation law. We do not need to watch the insides to know at least something about the game.","All things, even ourselves, are made of fine-grained, enormouslystrongly interacting plus and minus parts, all neatly balanced out. Once in a while,by accident, we may rub off a few minuses or a few plusses (usually it is easierto rub off minuses), and in those circumstances we find the force of electricityunbalanced, and we can then see the effects of these electrical attractions.","What\u2019s the idea of arguing with that man? The man is a painter; he\u2019s been a painter all his life, and he says he gets yellow. So why argue with him? I felt embarrassed. I didn\u2019t know what to say. Finally I said, \u201cAll my life, I\u2019ve been studying light. And I think that with red and white you can\u2019t get yellow\u2014you can only get pink.\u201d So I went to the five-and-ten and got the paint, and brought it back to the restaurant. The painter came down from upstairs, and the restaurant owner was there too. I put the cans of paint on an old chair, and the painter began to mix the paint. He put a little more red, he put a little more white\u2014it still looked pink to me\u2014and he mixed some more. Then he mumbled something like, \u201cI used to have a little tube of yellow here, to sharpen it up a bit\u2014then this\u2019ll be yellow.\u201d \u201cOh!\u201d I said. \u201cOf course! You add yellow, and you can get yellow, but you couldn\u2019t do it without the yellow.\u201d The painter went back upstairs to paint. The restaurant owner said, \u201cThat guy has his nerve, arguing with a guy who\u2019s studied light all his life!\u201d But that shows you how much I trusted these \u201creal guys.\u201d The painter had told me so much stuff that was\u201d","WE ARE ALL SAD when we think of the wondrous potentialities that human beings seem to have and when we contrast these potentialities with the small accomplishments that we have.

Of course. I was an ordinary person who studied hard. There\'s no miracle people. It just happens they got interested in this thing, and they learned all this stuff. They\'re just people. There\'s no talent or special miracle ability to understand quantum mechanics or a miracle ability to imagine electromagnetic fields that comes without practice and reading and learning and study. So if you take an ordinary person who\'s willing to devote a great deal of time and study and work and thinking and mathematics, then he\'s become a scientist.","I can\u2019t understand anything in general unless I\u2019m carrying along in my mind a specific example and watching it go.

So I must have had some sort of accent playing the frigideira, because I couldn\'t compete with those guys who had been playing it all their lives; it must have been some kind of dumb accent.

This causes the electron to easily break away from its own nucleus under the influence of photons from other atoms. A large number of such atoms close together easily lose their individual third electrons to form a sea of electrons swimming around from atom to atom. This sea of electrons reacts to any small electrical force (photons), generating a current of electrons-I am describing lithium metal conducting electricity. Hydrogen and helium atoms do not lose their electrons to other atoms. They are \\"insulators.\\"All the atoms-more than one hundred different kinds-are made up of a certain number of protons exchanging photons with the same number of electrons. The patterns in which they gather are complicated and offer an enormous variety of properties: some are metals, some are insulators, some are gases, others are crystals; there are soft things, hard things, colored things, and transparent things-a terrific cornucopia of variety and excitement that comes from the exclusion principle and the repetition again and again and again of the three very simple actions P(A to B), E(A to B), and j. (If the electrons in the world were unpolarized, all the atoms would have very similar properties: the electrons would all cluster together, close to the nucleus of their own atom, and would not be easily attracted to other atoms to make chemical reactions.)","What about the inside of the earth? A great deal is known about the speed ofearthquake waves through the earth and the density of distribution of the earth.However, physicists have been unable to get a good theory as to how dense asubstance should be at the pressures that would be expected at the center of theearth. In other words, we cannot figure out the properties of matter very well inthese circumstances. We do much less well with the earth than we do with theconditions of matter in the stars. The mathematics involved seems a little toodifficult, so far, but perhaps it will not be too long before someone realizes thatit is an important problem, and really work it out. The other aspect, of course, isthat even if we did know the density, we cannot figure out the circulating currents.Nor can we really work out the properties of rocks at high pressure. We cannottell how fast the rocks should \\"give\\"; that must all be worked out by experiment.","I think I can safely say that nobody understands quantum mechanics.","If we increase the pressure, we can make it solidify.","When a person has been negative to you, and then you do something like that, they\u2019re usually a hundred percent the other way, kind of to compensate.","You don\u2019t have to be responsible for the world that you\u2019re in.","Each of us talked about what we thought the \u201cethics of equality was, from our own point of view, without paying any attention to the other guy\u2019s point of view. For example, the historian proposed that the way to understand ethical problems is to look historically at how they evolved and how they developed; the international lawyer suggested that the way to do it is to see how in fact people actually act in different situations and make their arrangements; the Jesuit priest was always referring to \u201cthe fragmentation of knowledge\u201d and I, as a scientist, proposed that we should isolate the problem in a way analogous to Galileo\u2019s techniques for experiments; and so on. \u201cSo, in my opinion,\u201d I said, \u201cwe had no dialogue at all.

As the thickness of a layer increases, the two surfaces produce a partial reflection of monochromatic light whose probability fluctuates in a cycle from 0% to 16%. Since the speed of the imaginary stopwatch hand is different for different colors of light, the cycle repeats itself at different rates. Thus when two colors such as pure red and pure blue are aimed at the layer, a given thickness will reflect only red, only blue, both red and blue in different proportions (which produce various hues of violet), or neither color (black). If the layer is of varying thicknesses, such as a drop of oil spreading out on a mud puddle, all of the combinations will occur. In sunlight, which consists of all colors, all sorts of combinations occur, which produce lots of colors.","So the liquid gradually cools if it evaporates.","The differ-ence between solids and liquids is, then, that in a solid the atoms are arranged insome kind of an array, called a crystalline array, and they do not have a randomposition at long distances; the position of the atoms on one side of the crystalis determined by that of other atoms millions of atoms away on the other side ofthe crystal. Figure 1-4 is an invented arrangement for ice, and although it con-tains many of the correct features of ice, it is not the true arrangement. One of thecorrect features is that there is a part of the symmetry that is hexagonal. You cansee that if we turn the picture around an axis by 120\xb0, the picture returns to itself.So there is a symmetry in the ice which accounts for the six-sided appearance ofsnowflakes. Another thing we can see from Fig. 1-4 is why ice shrinks when itmelts. The particular crystal pattern of ice shown here has many \\"holes\\" in it,as does the true ice structure. When the organization breaks down, these holescan be occupied by molecules. Most simple substances, with the exception ofwater and type metal, expand upon melting, because the atoms are closely packedin the solid crystal and upon melting need more room to jiggle around, but anopen structure collapses, as in the case of water.","Why do we see no change? Because just as many molecules are leaving as are coming back! In the long run \u201cnothing happens. If we then take the top of the vessel off and blow the moist air away, replacing it with dry air, then the number of molecules leaving is just the same as it was before, because this depends on the jiggling of the water, but the number coming back is greatly reduced because there are so many fewer water molecules above the water. Therefore\u201d","MIT has developed for itself a spirit, so that every member of the whole place thinks that it\'s the most wonderful place in the world_ it\'s the center, somehow, of scientific and technological development in the United States, if not the world. It\'s like a New Yorker\'s view of New York: they forget the rest of the country.....So MIT was good, but Slater was right to warn me to go to another school for my graduate work. And I often advise my students the same way. Learn what the rest of the world is like. The variety is worthwhile.","Oh! My day is complete. Today I met a general, and a professor!","Figure 36. A \\"trick\\" can be played on Nature by slowing down the light that takes shorter paths: glass of just the right thickness is inserted so that all the paths will take exactly the same time. This causes all of the arrows to point in the same direction, and to produce a whopping final arrow-lots of light! Such a piece of glass made to greatly increase the probability of light getting from a source to a single point is called a focusing lens.","To understand this better, we need to know that the cycle of zero to 16% partial reflection by two surfaces repeats more quickly for blue light than for red light. Thus at certain thicknesses, one or the other or both colors are strongly reflected, while at other thicknesses, reflections of both colors is cancelled out (see Fig. 18). The cycles of reflection repeat at different rates because the stopwatch hand turns around faster when it times a blue photon than it does when timing a red photon. In fact, that\'s the only difference between a red photon and a blue photon (or a photon of any other color, including radio waves, X-rays, and so on)-the speed of the stopwatch hand.","When you have put a lot of ideas together to make an elaborate theory, you want to make sure, when explaining what it fits, that those things it fits are not just the things that gave you the idea for the theory; but that the finished theory makes something else come out right, in addition.","How do we know that there are atoms?","It is interesting that this thoroughness, which is a virtue, is often misunderstood. When someone says a thing has been done scientifically, often all he means is that it has been done thoroughly. I have heard people talk of the \u201cscientific extermination of the Jews in Germany. There was nothing scientific about it. It was only thorough.\u201d","I think it\'s much more interesting to live not knowing than to have answers which might be wrong. [...] I don\'t have to know an answer. I don\'t feel frightened not knowing things, by being lost in a mysterious universe without any purpose, which is the way it really is, as far as I can tell.","The interpretation of a result is an example. To take a trivial instance, there is a famous joke about a man who complains to a friend of a mysterious phenomenon. The white horses on his farm eat more than the black horses. He worries about this and cannot understand it, until his friend suggests that maybe he has more white horses than black ones.","If a Martian (who, we\u2019ll imagine, never dies except by accident) came to Earth and saw this peculiar race of creatures\u2014these humans who live about seventy or eighty years, knowing that death is going to come\u2014it would look to him like a terrible problem of psychology to live under those circumstances, knowing that life is only temporary. Well, we humans somehow figure out how to live despite this problem: we laugh, we joke, we live.","So the chemicalproperties of a substance depend only on a number, the number of electrons. (Thewhole list of elements of the chemists really could have been called 1, 2, 3, 4, 5,etc. Instead of saying \\"carbon,\\" we could say \\"element six,\\" meaning six electrons,but of course, when the elements were first discovered, it was not known that theycould be numbered that way, and secondly, it would make everything look rathercomplicated. It is better to have names and symbols for these things, rather thanto call everything by number.)","How do we know that there are atoms? By one of the tricks mentioned earlier: we make the hypothesis that there are atoms, and one after the other results come out the way we predict, as they ought to if things are made of atoms. There is also somewhat more direct evidence, a good example of which is the following: The","and dynamic dance.","So I started to think: \\"How can that happen?\\"... So the guy says, \\"What are you doing? You come fix the radio, but you\'re only walking back and forth!\\" I say, \\"I\'m thinking!","With the thinnest possible layer of glass, we find that the number of photons arriving at A is nearly always zero-sometimes it\'s like 1. When we replace the thinnest layer with a slightly thicker one, we find that the amount of light reflected is higher-closer to the expected 8%. After a few more replacements the count of photons arriving at A increases past the 8% mark. As we continue to substitute still \\"thicker \\" layers of glass-we\'re up to about 5 millionths of an inch now-the amount of light reflected by the two surfaces reaches a maximum of 16%, and then goes down, through 8%, back to zero-if the layer of glass is just the right thickness, there is no reflection at all. (Do that with spots!)With gradually thicker and thicker layers of glass, partial reflection again increases to 16% and returns to zero-a cycle that repeats itself again and again(see Fig. 5). Newton discovered these oscillations and did one experiment that could be correctly interpreted only if the oscillations continued for 34,000 cycles! Today, with lasers (which produce a very pure, monochromatic light), we can see this cycle still going strong after more than 100,000,000 repetitions-which corresponds to glass that is more than 50 meters thick. (We don\'t see this phenomenon every day because the light source is normally not monochromatic.)So it turns out that our prediction of 8% is right as an overall average (since the actual amount varies in a regular pattern from zero to 16%), but it\'s exactly right only twice each cycle-like a stopped clock (which is right twice a day).","I wrote a letter to her and proposed. Somebody who\u2019s wise could have told me that was dangerous: When you\u2019re away and you\u2019ve got nothing but paper, and you\u2019re feeling lonely, you remember all the good things and you can\u2019t remember the reasons you had the arguments. And it didn\u2019t work out. The arguments started again right away, and the marriage lasted for only two years. There","You might say that the only reason for the anti-neutrino is to make the conservation of energy right. But it makes a lot of other things right, like the conservation of momentum and other conservation laws, and very recently it has been directly demonstrated that such neutrinos do indeed exist.","When we put an electron in an electric field,we say it is \\"pulled.\\" We then have two rules: (a) charges make a field, and(b) charges in fields have forces on them and move. The reason for this will be-come clear when we discuss the following phenomena: If we were to charge a body,say a comb, electrically, and then place a charged piece of paper at a distance andmove the comb back and forth, the paper will respond by always pointing to thecomb. If we shake it faster, it will be discovered that the paper is a little behind,there is a delay in the action. (At the first stage, when we move the comb ratherslowly, we find a complication which is magnetism. Magnetic influences have todo with charges in relative motion, so magnetic forces and electric forces can reallybe attributed to one field, as two different aspects of exactly the same thing. Achanging electric field cannot exist without magnetism.) If we move the chargedpaper farther out, the delay is greater. Then an interesting thing is observed.Although the forces between two charged objects should go inversely as thesquare of the distance, it is found, when we shake a charge, that the influenceextends very much farther out than we would guess at first sight. That is, the effectfalls off more slowly than the inverse square.","This example illustrates a point. How is it possible that we can extend our laws into regions we are not sure about? Why are we so confident that, because we have checked the energy conservation here, when we get a new phenomenon we can say it has to satisfy the law of conservation of energy ?","We call the sum of the weights times the heights gravitational potentialenergy\u2014the energy which an object has because of its relationship in space, rela-tive to the earth.","For instance, the mass of an object changes when it moves, because of the conservation of energy. Because of the relation of mass and energy the energy associated with the motion appears as an extra mass, so things get heavier when they move. Newton","Whether the proton decays or not is not known. To prove that it does not decay is very difficult.","If we had an atom and wished tosee the nucleus, we would have to magnify it until the whole atom was the size ofa large room, and then the nucleus would be a bare speck which you could justabout make out with the eye, but very nearly all the weight of the atom is in thatinfinitesimal nucleus. What keeps the electrons from simply falling in? Thisprinciple: If they were in the nucleus, we would know their position precisely, andthe uncertainty principle would then require that they have a very large (butuncertain) momentum, i.e., a very large kinetic energy. With this energy theywould break away from the nucleus. They make a compromise: they leave them-selves a little room for this uncertainty and then jiggle with a certain amount ofminimum motion in accordance with this rule.","Know how to solve every problem that has been solved","Throughout this entire story there remains one especially unsatisfactory feature: the observed masses of the particles, m. There is no theory that adequately explains these numbers. We use the numbers in all our theories, but we don\'t understand them-what they are, or where they come from. I believe that from a fundamental point of view, this is a very interesting and serious problem.","Let us make recommendations to ensure that NASA officials deal in a world of reality, understanding technological weaknesses and imperfections well enough to be actively trying to eliminate them. They must live in a world of reality in comparing the costs and utility of the shuttle to other methods of entering space. And they must be realistic in making contracts and in estimating the costs and difficulties of each project. Only realistic flight schedules should be proposed -- schedules that have a reasonable chance of being met. If in this way the government would not support NASA, the so be it. NASA owes it to the citizens from whom it asks support to be frank, honest, and informative, so that these citizens can make the wisest decisions for the use of their limited resources.","Translate these numbers, which are written in base seven, to base five. Translating from one base to another is an utterly useless thing. If you can do it, maybe it\u2019s entertaining; if you can\u2019t do it, forget it. There\u2019s no point to it.\u201d","For example, the force of electricity between two charged objects looks just like the law of gravitation: the force of electricity is a constant, with a minus sign, times the product of the charges, and varies inversely as the square of the distance. It is in the opposite direction-likes repel. But is it still not very remarkable that the two laws involve the same function of distance? Perhaps gravitation and electricity are much more closely related than we think. Many attempts have been made to unify them; the so called unified-field theory is only a very elegant attempt to combine electricity and gravitation; but, in comparing gravitation and electricity , the most interesting thing is the relative strengths of the forces. Any theory that contains them both must also deduce how strong the gravity is.","If we burn the carbon with very little oxygen in a very rapid reaction (for example,in an automobile engine, where the explosion is so fast that there is not time forit to make carbon dioxide) a considerable amount of carbon monoxide is formed.In many such rearrangements, a very large amount of energy is released, formingexplosions, flames, etc., depending on the reactions. Chemists have studied thesearrangements of the atoms, and found that every substance is some type of arrange-ment of atoms.","The general name of energy which has to do with location relative to some-thing else is called potential energy.","Suppose we had some kind of device with particles moving with a certain definite symmetry, and suppose their movements were bilaterally symmetrical (fig. 20). Then, following the laws of physics, with all the movements and collisions, you could expect, and rightly, that if you look at the same picture later on it will still be bilaterally symmetrical. So there is a kind of conservation, the conservation of the symmetry character. This should be in the table, but it is not like a number that you measure, and we will discuss it in much more detail in the next lecture. The reason this is not very interesting in classical physics is because the times when there are such nicely symmetrical initial conditions are very rare, and it is therefore a not very important or practical conservation law. But","I finally figured out a way to test whether you have taught an idea or you have only taught a definition. Test it this way: You say, \'Without using the new word which you have just learned, try to rephrase what you have just learned in your own language. Without using the word \\"energy,\\" tell me what you know now about the dog\'s motion.\' You cannot. So you learned nothing about science. That may be all right. You may not want to learn something about science right away. You have to learn definitions. But for the very first lesson, is that not possibly destructive?","When you were sick you worried because you could not give me something that you wanted to and thought I needed.

At first it is standing still, say, in empty space, and then it shoots some gas out of the back, and the rocket goes forward. The point is that of all the stuff in the world, the centre of mass, the average of all the mass, is still right where it was before. The interesting part has moved on, and an uninteresting part that we do not care about has moved back. There","Now, let\'s look again at the partial reflection of light by a layer of glass. How does it work? I talked about light reflected from the front surface and the back surface. This idea of surfaces was a simplification I made in order to keep things easy at the beginning. Light is really not affected by surfaces. An incoming photon is scattered by the electrons in the atoms inside the glass, and a new photon comes back up to the detector. It\'s interesting that instead of adding up all the billions of tiny arrows that represent the amplitude for all the electrons inside the glass to scatter an incoming photon, we can add just two arrows-for the \\"front surface\\" and \\"back surface\\" reflections-and come out with the same answer. Let\'s see why.","The sciences do not directly teach good and bad.","All proteins are not enzymes, but all enzymes are proteins.","unknown.

That is the sense in which we say that the laws of physics are symmetrical; that there are things we can do to the physical laws, or to our way of representing the physical laws, which make no difference, and leave everything unchanged in its effects. It is this aspect of physical laws that is going to concern us in this lecture.","We were told to be very careful\u2014not to buy our train ticket in Princeton, for example, because Princeton was a very small station, and if everybody bought train tickets to Albuquerque, New Mexico, in Princeton, there would be some suspicions that something was up.

For this reason it\'s called a \\"positron.\\" The positron is a sister particle to the electron, and is an example of an \\"anti-particle.\\"This phenomenon is general. Every particle in Nature has an amplitude to move backwards in time, and therefore has an anti-particle. When a particle and its anti-particle collide, they annihilate each other and form other particles. (For positrons and electrons annihilating, it is usually a photon or two.) And what about photons?

Amazing!","A source of white light-many colors mixed together-emits photons in a chaotic manner: the angle of the amplitude changes abruptly and irregularly in fits and starts. But when we construct a monochromatic source, we are making a device that has been carefully arranged so that the amplitude for a photon to be emitted at a certain time is easily calculated: it changes its angle at a constant speed, like a stopwatch hand. (Actually, this arrow turns at the same speed as the imaginary stopwatch we used before, but in the opposite direction-see Fig. 67.)","The conservation of energy is a little more difficult, because this time we have a number which is not changed in time, but this number does not represent any particular thing.

The two numbers that are put in are called the mass of the electron and the charge of the electron.","As an example of something , let us consider the time it takes light to go across a proton, 10 to the negative 24 second. If we compare this time with the age of the universe , 2 times 10 to the tenth power years, the answer is 10 to the negative 42nd power. It has about the same number of zeros going off it, so it has been proposed that the gravitational constant is related to the age of the universe.","There is also a rhythm and a pattern between the phenomena of nature which is not apparent to the eye, but only to the eye of analysis; and it is these rhythms and patterns which we call Physical Laws.

Incidentally, there was once a certain difficulty with the moons of Jupiter that is worth remarking on. These satellites were studied very carefully by R\xf8mer, who noticed that the moons sometimes seemed to be ahead of schedule, and sometimes behind. (One can find their schedules by waiting a very long time and finding out how long it takes on the average for the moons to go around.) Now they were ahead when Jupiter was particularly close to the earth and they were behind when Jupiter was farther from the earth. This would have been a very difficult thing to explain according to the law of gravitation\u2014it would have been, in fact, the death of this wonderful theory if there were no other explanation. If a law does not work even in one place where it ought to, it is just wrong. But the reason for this discrepancy was very simple and beautiful: it takes a little while to see the moons of Jupiter because of the time it takes light to travel from Jupiter to the earth. When Jupiter is closer to the earth the time is a little less, and when it is farther from the earth, the time is more. This is why moons appear to be, on the average, a little ahead or a little behind, depending on whether they are closer to or farther from the earth. This phenomenon showed that light does not travel instantaneously, and furnished the first estimate of the speed of light. This was done in\xa01676.","What do we mean by \u201cunderstanding something? We can imagine that this complicated array of moving things which constitutes \u201cthe world\u201d is something like a great chess game being played by the gods, and we are observers of the game. We do not know what the rules of the game are; all we are allowed to do is to watch the playing. Of course, if we watch long enough, we may eventually catch on to a few of the rules. The rules of the game are what we mean by fundamental physics. Even if we knew every rule, however, we might not be able to understand why a particular move is made in the game, merely because it is too complicated and our minds are limited.\u201d","When we add all the numbers together, from all the different forms of energy, it always gives the same total.

It has about the same number of zeros going off it, so it has been proposed that the gravitational constant is related to the age of the universe.","One very important feature of pseudo forces is that they are always proportional to the masses; the same is true of gravity. The possibility exists, therefore, that gravity is a pseudo force. Is it not possible that perhaps gravitation is due simply to the fact that we do not have the right coordinate system? After all, we can always get a force proportional to the mass if we imagine that a body is accelerating. For instance, a man shut up in a box that is standing still on the earth finds himself held to the floor of the box with a certain force that is proportional to his mass. But if there were no earth at all and the box were standing still, the man inside would float in space. On the other hand, if there were no earth at all and something were pulling the box along with an acceleration g, then the man in the box analyzing physics would find a pseudo force which would pull him to the floor, just as gravity does.","Just as the electrical interaction can be connected to a particle, a photon, Yukawa suggested that the forces between neutrons and protons also have a field of some kind, and that when this field jiggles it behaves like a particle.","You may not like the idea of action at a distance. How can this object know what is going on over there? So","Einstein put forward the famous hypothesis that accelerations give an imitation of gravitation, that the forces of acceleration (the pseudo forces) cannot be distinguished from those of gravity; it is not possible to tell how much of a given force is gravity and how much is pseudo force.","Although I have mentioned a large number of energies, I would like to explain that we are not completely ignorant about this, and we do understand the relationship of some of them to others.

Elastic","From a long view of the history of mankind-seen from, say, ten thousand years from now-there can be little doubt that the most significant event of the nineteenth century will be judged as Maxwell\'s discovery of the laws of electro dynamics.","The next question was \u2014 what makes planets go around the sun? At the time of Kepler some people answered this problem by saying that there were angels behind them beating their wings and pushing the planets around an orbit. As you will see, the answer is not very far from the truth. The only difference is that the angels sit in a different direction and their wings push inward.","Thus, some things that satisfy the rules of algebra can be interesting to mathematicians even though they don\'t always represent a real situation. Arrows on a plane can be \\"added\\" by putting the head of one arrow on the tail of another, or \\"multiplied\\" by successive turns and shrinks. Since these arrows obey the same rules of algebra as regular numbers, mathematicians call them numbers. But to distinguish them from ordinary numbers, they\'re called \\"complex numbers.\\" For those of you who have studied mathematics enough to have come to complex numbers, I could have said, \\"the probability of an event is the absolute square of a complex number. When an event can happen in alternative ways, you add the complex numbers; when it can happen only as a succession of steps, you multiply the complex numbers.\\" Although it may sound more impressive that way, I have not said any more than I did before-I just used a different language.","It always bothers me that, according to the laws as we understand them today, it takes a computing machine an infinite number of logical operations to figure out what goes on in no matter how tiny a region of space, and no matter how tiny a region of time. How can all that be going on in that tiny space ? Why should it take an infinite amount of logic to figure out what one tiny piece of space/time is going to do? So I have often made the hypothesis that ultimately physics will not require a mathematical statement, that in the end the machinery will be revealed, and the laws will turn out to be simple, like the chequer board with all its apparent complexities. But","But wait, he said. \u201cLet\u2019s suppose it returns by advanced waves\u2014reactions backward in time\u2014so it comes back at the right time.

So maybe we can make it all compensate.\u201d","So we see that a substance\u2019s properties must be limited in a certain way; one cannot make up anything he wants, or he would be able to invent a substance which he could use to produce more than the maximum allowable work when he carried it around a reversible cycle. This principle, this limitation, is the only real rule that comes out of the thermodynamics.","The physicist uses ordinary words in a peculiar manner. To him a conservation law means that there is a number which you can calculate at one moment, then as nature undergoes its multitude of changes, if you calculate this quantity again at a later time it will be the same as it was before, the number does not change. An example is the conservation of energy. There is a quantity that you can calculate according to a certain rule, and it comes out the same answer always, no matter what happens.","So now, I present to you the three basic actions, from which all the phenomena of light and electrons arise.-ACTION #1: A photon goes from place to place.-ACTION #2: An electron goes from place to place.-ACTION #3: An electron emits or absorbs a photon.Each of these actions has an amplitude-an arrow-that can be calculated according to certain rules.","This is in the nature of a conservation law.

Clouds form and disappear again\u2014from the compression and expansion of the shock wave.

It could mean simply that the equations are similar for different phenomena; but then, of course, we have given no explanation. The underlying unity might mean that everything is made out of the same stuff, and therefore obeys the same equations. That sounds like a good explanation, but let us think. The electrostatic potential, the diffusion of neutrons, heat flow - are we really dealing with the same stuff? Can we really imagine that the electrostatic potential is physically identical to the temperature, or to the density of particles? Certainly is not exactly the same as the thermal energy of particles. The displacement of a membrane is certainly not like a temperature. Why, then, is there an underlying unity?

The band was very nice: they had an extra cowbell lying around, and they encouraged me to play it. So I started to play a little bit, and since their music was very rhythmic (and the cowbell is just an accompaniment\u2014you can\u2019t screw it up) I really got hot. After the party was over, the guy who organized the party told me that the bandleader said, \u201cGeez! Who was that guy who came down and played on the cowbell!

And that\'s why, in approximation, we can get away with the crude picture of the world that says that light only goes where the time is least (and it\'s easy to rpve that were the time is least, the angle of incidence is equal to the angle of reflection, but I don\'t have the time to show you).So the theory of quantum electrodynamics gave the right answer-the middle of the mirror is the important part for reflection-but this correct result came out at the expense of believing that light reflects all over the mirror, and having to add a bunch of little arrows together whose sole purpose was to cancel out. All that might seem to you to be a waste of time-some silly game for mathematicians only.

You look at the equipment before and after the experiment, and look for changes. When we were calculating the probability that a photon gets from S to D with no detectors at A or B, the event was, simply, the detector at D makes a click. When a click at D was the only change in conditions, there was no way to tell which way the photon went, so there was interference.When we put in detectors at A and B, we changed the problem. Now, it turns out, there are two complete events-two sets of final conditions-that are distinguishable: 1) the detectors at A and D go off, or 2) the detectors at B and D go off. When there are a number of possible final conditions in an experiment, we must calculate the probability of each as a separate, complete event.","Damn deez doilies!","The most reasonable possibilities often turn out not to be the situation.

If we go even further, the earth is not exactly a sphere because it is rotating and this brings in centrifugal effects which tend to oppose gravity near the equator.

So","So when you try to squeeze light too much to make sure it\'s going in only a straight line, it refuses to cooperate and begins to spread out.","To summarize: every reversiblemachine, no matter how it operates, which drops one pound one foot and liftsa three-pound weight always lifts it the same distance, X. This is clearly a universallaw of great utility.","The strange feature of partial reflection by two surfaces has forced physicists away form making absolute predictions to merely calculating the probability of an event. Quantum electrodynamics provides a method for doing this-drawing little arrows on a piece of paper. The probability of an event is represented by the area of the square of an arrow. For example, an arrow representing a probability of 0.04 (4%) has a length of 0.2.","The best teaching can be done only when there is a direct individual relationship between a student and a good teacher\u2014a situation in which the student discusses the ideas, thinks about the things, and talks aboutthe things. It\u2019s impossible to learn very much by simply sitting in a lecture, or even by simply doing problems that are assigned.","Odiar\xeda morir dos veces, ser\xeda tan aburrido!.","all ordinary phenomena can be explained by the actions and the motions of particles. For","Even a very small effect sometimes requires profound changes in our ideas","One of the most impressive discoveries was the origin of the energy of thestars, that makes them continue to burn. One of the men who discovered this wasout with his girl friend the night after he realized that nuclear reactions must begoing on in the stars in order to make them shine. She said \\"Look at how prettythe stars shine!\\" He said \\"Yes, and right now I am the only man in the worldwho knows why they shine.\\" She merely laughed at him. She was not impressedwith being out with the only man who, at that moment, knew why stars shine.Well, it is sad to be alone, but that is the way it is in this world.","For example, life itself is supposedly understandable in principle from the movements of atoms, and those atoms are made out of neutrons, protons and electrons. I must immediately say that when we state that we understand it in principle, we only mean that we think that, if we could figure everything out, we would find that there is nothing new in physics which needs to be discovered in order to understand the phenomena of life. Another","A poet once said, \u201cThe whole universe is in a glass of wine. We will probably never know in what sense he meant that, for poets do not write to be understood.\u201d","Science is a people-driven activity like all human endeavor, and just as subject to fashion and whim.","What will happen at very low temperatures is indicated in Fig. 1-4: the molecules lock into a new pattern which is ice. This particular schematic diagram of ice is wrong because it is in two dimensions, but it is right qualitatively. The interesting point is that the material has a definite place for every atom, and you can easily appreciate that if somehow or other we were to hold all the atoms at one end of the drop in a certain arrangement, each atom in a certain place, then because of the structure of interconnections, which is rigid, the other end miles away (at our magnified scale) will have a definite location. So","life behind him by this time (he died in 1988), so he could reflect on his experiences and accomplishments with the","If a piece of steel or a piece of salt, consisting of atoms one next to the other, can have such interesting properties; if water\u2014which is nothing but these little blobs, mile upon mile of the same thing over the earth\u2014can form waves and foam, and make rushing noises and strange patterns as it runs over cement; if all of this, all the life of a stream of water, can be nothing but a pile of atoms, how much more is possible? If","We do not yet know all the basic laws: there is an expanding frontier of ignorance","Is it possible that that \u201cthing walking back and forth in front of you, talking to you, is a great glob of these atoms in a very complex arrangement, such that the sheer complexity of it staggers the imagination as to what it can do? When\u201d","If we heat the water, the jiggling increases and the volume between the atoms increases, and if the heating continues there comes a time when the pull between the molecules is not enough to hold them together and they do fly apart and become separated from one another.","It is the nuclear \\"burning\\" of hydrogen which supplies the energy of the sun;the hydrogen is converted into helium. Furthermore, ultimately, the manufactureof various chemical elements proceeds in the centers of the stars, from hydrogen.The stuff of which we are made, was \\"cooked\\" once, in a star, and spit out. Howdo we know? Because there is a clue. The proportion of the different isotopes\u2014how much C12, how much C13, etc., is something which is never changed bychemical reactions, because the chemical reactions are so much the same for thetwo. The proportions are purely the result of nuclear reactions. By looking at theproportions of the isotopes in the cold, dead ember which we are, we can discoverwhat the furnace was like in which the stuff of which we are made was formed.That furnace was like the stars, and so it is very likely that our elements were\\"made\\" in the stars and spit out in the explosions which we call novae and super-novae. Astronomy is so close to physics that we shall study many astronomicalthings as we go along.","One model I met through Jerry had been a Playboy playmate. She was tall and gorgeous. Every girl in the world, looking at her, would have been jealous. However, she thought she was too tall. When she would come into a room, she\u2019d be half stooped over. I tried to teach her, when she was posing, to please stand up, because she was so elegant and striking. I finally talked her into that. Then she had another worry: she\u2019s got \u201cdents near her groin. I have to get out a book of anatomy to show her that it\u2019s the attachment of the muscles to the ilium, and to explain to her that you can\u2019t see these dents on everybody; to see them, everything must be just right, in perfect proportion, like she was. I learned from her that every woman is worried about her looks, no matter how beautiful she is.\u201d","The difference between solids and liquids is, then, that in a solid the atoms are arranged in some kind of an array, called a crystalline array, and they do not have a random position at long distances; the position of the atoms on one side of the crystal is determined by that of other atoms millions of atoms away on the other side of the crystal.","If it were true that the stars could affect the day that it was good to go to the dentist \u2013 in America we have that kind of astrology \u2013 then physics theory would be proved wrong, because there is no mechanism understandable in principle from the behaviour of particles which would make this work. That","The atoms are 1 or 2 X 10-8 cm in radius. Now 10-8 cm is called anangstrom (just as another name), so we say they are 1 or 2 angstroms (\xc5) in radius.Another way to remember their size is this: if an apple is magnified to the sizeof the earth, then the atoms in the apple are approximately the size of the originalapple.","One of the most interesting technical problems may or may notbe called psychology. The central problem of the mind, if you will, or the nervoussystem, is this: when an animal learns something, it can do something differentthan it could before, and its brain cell must have changed too, if it is made out ofatoms. In what way is it different ? We do not know where to look, or what tolook for, when something is memorized. We do not know what it means, or whatchange there is in the nervous system, when a fact is learned. This is a very impor-tant problem which has not been solved at all.","Now the jiggling motion is what we represent as heat:when we increase the temperature, we increase the motion. If we heat the water,the jiggling increases and the volume between the atoms increases, and if theheating continues there comes a time when the pull between the molecules is notenough to hold them together and they do fly apart and become separated fromone another. Of course, this is how we manufacture steam out of water\u2014byincreasing the temperature; the particles fly apart because of the increased motion.","Assuming, however, that there issome kind of memory thing, the brain is such an enormous mass of interconnect ing wires and nerves that it probably cannot be analyzed in a straightforwardmanner. There is an analog of this to computing machines and computing ele-ments, in that they also have a lot of lines, and they have some kind of element,analogous, perhaps, to the synapse, or connection of one nerve to another. Thisis a very interesting subject which we have not the time to discuss further\u2014therelationship between thinking and computing machines. It must be appreciated,of course, that this subject will tell us very little about the real complexities ofordinary human behavior. All human beings are so different. It will be a longtime before we get there.","Hence, if you wish to evaporate water turn on the fan!","So I say, Yeah. The psychiatrist makes a note.....Do you talk to yourself?I admitted that I do....(incidentally, I didn\'t tell him something which I can tell you, which is I find myself sometimes talking to myself in quite an elaborate fashion....) \'The integral will be larger than the sum of the terms so that would make the pressure higher, you see?\' \'No, you\'re crazy.\' \'No, I\'m not! No, I\'m not!\' I say. I argue with myself. I have two voices that work back and forth.","We just have to take what we see, and then formulate all the rest of our ideas in terms of our actual experience.","In general we look for a new law by the following process. First we guess it. Then we compute the consequences of the guess to see what would be implied if this law that we guessed is right. Then we compare the result of the computation to nature, with experiment or experience, compare it directly with observation, to see if it works. If it disagrees with experiment it is wrong. In","My businessman friend Dudley Wright saw the drawing and I told him the story about it. He said, \u201cYou oughta triple its price. With art, nobody is really sure of its value, so people often think, \u2018If the price is higher, it must be more valuable!\u2019 I said, \u201cYou\u2019re crazy!\u201d but, just for fun, I bought a twenty-dollar frame and mounted the drawing so it would be ready for the next customer. Some guy from the weather forecasting business saw the drawing I had given Gianonni and asked if I had others. I invited him and his wife to my \u201cstudio\u201d downstairs in my home, and they asked about the newly framed drawing. \u201cThat one is two hundred dollars.\u201d (I had multiplied sixty by three and added twenty for the frame.) The next day they came back and bought it. So the massage parlor drawing ended up in the office of a weather forecaster.\u201d","therefore, did learn a lesson: The female mind is capable of understanding analytic geometry. Those people who have for years been insisting (in the face of all obvious evidence to the contrary) that the male and female are equal and capable of rational thought may have something. The difficulty may just be that we have never yet discovered a way to communicate with the female mind. If it is done in the right way, you may be able to get something out of it.","Have you read anywhere, by any poet, anything about time that compares with real time, with the long, slow process of evolution?","This is water vapor, which is always found above liquid water. (There is an equilibrium between the steam vapor and the water which will be described later.) In","You might wonder how such simple actions could produce such a complex world. It\'s because phenomena we see in the world are the result of an enormous intertwining of tremendous numbers of photon exchanges and interferences. Knowing the three fundamental actions is only a very small beginning toward analyzing any real situation."]')}}]);
