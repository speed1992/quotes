Wise men don\'t need to prove their point; men who need to prove their point aren\'t wise. The Master has no possessions. The more he does for others, the happier he is.

When you perceive that an act done to another is done to yourself, you have understood the great truth.","Empty your mind of all thoughts. Let your heart be at peace. Watch the turmoil of beings, but contemplate their return. Each separate being in the universe returns to the common source. Returning to the source is serenity. If you don\'t realize the source, you stumble in confusion and sorrow. When you realize where you come from, you naturally become tolerant, disinterested, amused, kindhearted as a grandmother, dignified as a king.

Achieve greatness in little things","The sage does not hoard.

In action, be aware of the time and the season.","Develop the strength of a man, but live as gently as a woman","Not valuing wealth prevents theft.","There is no illusion great than fear.","Yet mystery and imagination arise from the same source. This source is called darkness ... Darkness within darkness, the gateway to all understanding.","If a person seems wicked, do not cast him away. Awaken him with your words, elevate him with your deeds, repay his injury with your kindness. Do not cast him away; cast away his wickedness.","Those who seek knowledge, collect something every day. Those who seek the Way, let go of something every day.","He who knows how to be aggressive, and yet remains patient, becomes a receptacle for all of Nature\'s lessons.","The real key to health and happiness and success is self knowledge","Open yourself to the truth, then trust in your natural responses, and everything will fall into place.","Creating without claiming, Doing without taking credit, Guiding without interfering, This is Primal Virtue.","Water is the softest thing, yet it can penetrate mountains and earth.

What difference between yes and no? What difference between success and failure? Must you value what others value, avoid what others avoid? How ridiculous!","Fine words are traded. Noble deeds gain respect. But people who are not good, why abandon them?","Deal with difficult tasks while they are easy.  Act on large issues while they are small.","There was something formless and perfect before the universe was born. It is serene. Empty. Solitary. Unchanging. Infinite. Eternally present. It is the mother of the universe. For lack of a better name, I call it the Tao. It flows through all things, inside and outside, and returns to the origin of all things. The Tao is great. The universe is great. Earth is great. Man is great. These are the four great powers. Man follows the earth. Earth follows the universe. The universe follows the Tao. The Tao follows only itself.","Clay is moulded to make a vessel, but the utility of the vessel lies in the space where there is nothing. . . . Thus, taking advantage of what is, we recognize the utility of what is not.","The one who does not honor the teacher and the one who does not honor the task, although ever so knowledgeable, they are confused.","Approach your own inner life with a loving quality that accepts who you are without trying to change who you are.","If you attach yourself to gross energies - loving this person, hating that clan, rejecting one experience or habitually indulging in another - then you will lead a series of heavy, attached lives. This can go on for a very long and tedious time.","He who stands on tiptoe \\ndoesn\'t stand firm. \\nHe who rushes ahead \\ndoesn\'t go far. \\nHe who tries to shine \\ndims his own light. \\nHe who defines himself \\ncan\'t know who he really is. \\nHe who has power over others \\ncan\'t empower himself. \\nHe who clings to his work \\nwill create nothing that endures.","Most of the world\'s religions serve only to strengthen attachments to false concepts such as self and other, life and death, heaven and earth, and so on. Those who become entangled in these false ideas are prevented from perceiving the Integral Oneness.","When the student is ready the teacher will appear.","If you worry more for others\' beliefs, then you will be their slave.","Observe how endings become beginnings.","Prepare while it\'s easy.","Marriage is three parts love and seven parts forgiveness of sins.","Complete your task. Seek no reward. Make no claims. Without faltering fully choose to do what you must do.","When people see some things as beautiful, other things become ugly. When people see some things as good, other things become bad. Being and non-being create each other. Difficult and easy support each other. Long and short define each other. High and low depend on each other. Before and after follow each other. Therefore the Master acts without doing anything and teaches without saying anything. Things arise and she lets them come; things disappear and she lets them go. She has but doesn\'t possess, acts but doesn\'t expect. When her work is done, she forgets it. That is why it lasts forever.","Be careful what you water your dreams with. Water them with worry and fear and you will produce weeds that choke the life from your dream.","Can you deal with the most vital matters by letting events take their course? Can you step back from you own mind and thus understand all things?

Great affairs always start off being small.","Knowing others is wisdom, knowing yourself is enlightenment.","If you correct your mind the rest of your life will fall into place.","The eternal void is filled with infinite possibilities","To become learned, each day add something. To become enlightened, each day drop something","All action begins in rest... This is the ultimate truth.","A government can be compared to our lungs. Our lungs are best when we don\'t realize they are helping us breathe. It is when we are constantly aware of our lungs that we know they have come down with an illness.","If you close your mind in judgements and traffic with desires, your heart will be troubled. If you keep your mind from judging and aren\'t led by the senses, your heart will find peace.","It is wealth to be content.","The value of teaching without words and accomplishing without action is understood by few in the world.","That which offers no resistance can enter where there is no space.","Stop trying to control. Let go of fixed plans and concepts, and the world will govern itself.","Abandon knowledge and your worries are over.","The truly wise are content to be last. They are, therefore, first. They are indifferent to themselves. They are, therefore self-confident.","All things issue from it; all things return to it. To find the origin, trace back the manifestations. When you recognize the children and find the mother, you will be free of sorrow. If you close your mind in judgements and traffic with desires, your heart will be troubled. If you keep your mind from judging and aren\'t led by the senses, your heart will find peace. Seeing into darkness is clarity. Knowing how to yield is strength. Use your own light and return to the source of light. This is called practicing eternity.","Love is of all passions the strongest, for it attacks simultaneously the head, the heart and the senses.","Give up your relentless moralizing, the continual pinpricks which pierce the skin of your fellows. The distinction between good and evil is the sickness of the mind. Give up your morals, and the people will regain a love of their fellows.","The more laws that are written, the more criminals are produced.","As soon as you have made a thought, laugh at it.","Learn to lead in a nourishing manner. \\nLearn to lead without being possessive. \\nLearn to be helpful without taking the credit. \\nLearn to lead without coercion.","Why are the people starving?-\\nBecause their grain is being eaten up by the taxes\\nThat\'s why they\'re starving\\n\\nWhy are people rebellious?-\\nBecause those above them meddle in their lives\\nThat\'s why they\'re rebellious\\n\\nWhy do people regard death so lightly?-\\nBecause they are so involved with their own living\\nThat\'s why they regard death so lightly\\n\\nIn the end,\\nThe treasure of life is missed by those who hold on\\n    and gained by those who let go","Whatever is flexible and living will tend to grow; whatever is rigid and blocked will wither and die.","There is a time to go ahead and a time to stay behind. There is a time to breathe easy and time to breathe hard. There is a time to be vigorous and a time to be gentle. There is a time to gather and a time to release. Can you see things as they are And let them be all on their own?","Those who show off do not shine.","As for the \\"proper way:\\" it is the beginning of disorder.","Throw away profit and greed, and there won\'t be any thieves.","If you wish to be out front, then act as if you were behind.","Man\'s enemies are not demons, but human beings like himself.","Do not look only at yourself, and you will see much. Do not justify yourself, and you will be distinguished. Do not brag, and you will have merit. Do not be prideful, and your work will endure.","Nature\'s way is simple and easy, but men prefer the intricate and artificial.","Only fools seek power, and the greatest fools seek it through force.","Those who understand others are clever, those who understand themselves are wise.","The Tao is unpredictable to those that live according to plans. Only those who have no agenda are in harmony with the Tao.","Going forward seems like retreat.","The biggest in the world is small in its beginning.","One who lives in accordance with nature does not go against the way of things but moves in harmony with the present moment.","Rushing into action, you fail. Trying to grasp things, you lose them. Forcing a project to completion, you ruin what was almost ripe.","Covetousness is the greatest misfortune. One who does not know what is enough will never have enough.","For the wise man looks into space and he knows there is no limited dimensions.","How can one liberate the many? By first liberating his own being. He does this not by elevating himself, but by lowering himself. He lowers himself to that which is simple, modest, true; integrating it into himself, he becomes a master of simplicity, modesty, truth.","Those who take long steps cannot keep the pace.","When life begins       we are tender and weak When life ends       we are stiff and rigid All things, including the grass and trees,      are soft and pliable in life      and dry in brittle in death So the soft and supple       are the companion of life While the stiff and unyielding       are the companions of death An army that cannot yield      will be defeated A tree that cannot bend      will crack in the wind Thus by Nature\'s own decree      the hard and strong are defeated      while the soft and gentle are triumphant","He who controls the past controls the future.","The way of heaven is to help and not harm.","Do not imagine that an integral being has the ambition of enlightening the unaware or raising worldly people to the divine realm. To her, there is no self and other, and hence no one to be raised; no heaven and hell, and hence no destination.","First, we must do our own personal work, then we tend the necessary work of our family, then our community, then the world.","Because he (the Sage) opposes no one, no one in the world can oppose him.","It is better to do one\'s own duty, however defective it may be, than to follow the duty of another, however well one may perform it. He who does his duty as his own nature reveals it, never sins.","Those who stay where they are will endure.","Be who you are, and go the whole way.","Free from desire, you realize the mystery, caught in the desire, you see only the manifestations.","Life is going forth; death is returning home.","Return animosity with virtue.","Every being in the universe is an expression of the Tao. It springs into existence, unconscious, perfect, free, takes on a physical body, lets circumstances complete it. That is why every being spontaneously honors the Tao. The Tao gives birth to all beings, nourishes them, maintains them, cares for them, comforts them, protects them, takes them back to itself, creating without possessing, acting without expecting, guiding without interfering. That is why love of the Tao is in the very nature of things.","The Master observes the world, but trusts his inner vision. He allows things to come and go. His heart is as open as the sky.","Deal with the small before it becomes large.","Try to change it and you will ruin it. Try to hold it and you will lose it.","Stop leaving and you will arrive, Stop searching and you will see, Stop running away and you will be found.","See others as yourself. See families as your family. See towns as your town. See countries as your country. See worlds as your world.","The Way is ever nameless.","If you want everything, you first have to give everything up.","The wise man puts himself last and finds himself first.","Nothing in the world is more flexible and yielding than water. Yet when it attacks the firm and the strong, none can withstand it, because they have no way to change it. So the flexible overcome the adamant, the yielding overcome the forceful. Everyone knows this, but no one can do it.","Pain and happiness are simply conditions of the ego. Forget the ego.","The one who can dissolve her mind will suddenly discover the Tao at her feet.","As long as we have hope, we have direction, the energy to move, and the map to move by. We have a hundred alternatives, a thousand paths and an infinity of dreams. Hopeful, we are halfway to where we want to go; hopeless, we are lost forever.","Nothing in the world is as soft and yielding as water. Yet for dissolving the hard and inflexible, nothing can surpass it. The soft overcomes the hard; the gentle overcomes the rigid. Everyone knows this is true, but few can put it into practice. Therefore the Master remains serene in the midst of sorrow. Evil cannot enter his heart. Because he has given up helping, he is people\'s greatest help. True words seem paradoxical.","The best way to manage anything is by making use of its own nature.","Good words shall gain you honor in the marketplace, but good deeds shall gain you friends among men.","Music in the soul can be heard by the universe.","The feminine values are the fountain of bliss. Know the masculine, Keep to the feminine.","Some lose yet gain, others gain and yet lose","He does not struggle with anyone - thus no one can vanquish him.","My own words are not the medicine, but a prescription; not the destination, but a map to help you reach it. When you get there, quiet your mind and close your mouth. Don\'t analyze the Tao. Strive instead to live it: silently, undividedly, with your whole harmonious being.","Stillness is the ruler of haste.","A good manager is best when people barely know that he exists. Not so good when people obey and acclaim him.

Immersed in wonder, you can deal with whatever life brings you, and when death comes, you are ready.","All men desire to free themselves solely from death; they do not know how to free themselves from life.","Every human being\'s essential nature is perfect and faultless, but after years of immersion in the world we easily forget our roots and take on a counterfeit nature.","Take care with the end as you do with the beginning","Not-knowing is true knowledge. \\nPresuming to know is a disease.\\nFirst realize that you are sick;\\nthen you can move toward health.","I have three precious things which I hold fast and prize.

This is a paradigm for non-action: the purest and most effective form of action. The game plays the game; the poem writes the poem; we can\'t tell the dancer from the dance. It happens when we trust the intelligence of the universe in the same way that an athlete or a dancer trusts the superior intelligence of the body.","Be Content with what you have; rejoice in the way things are. When you realize there is nothing lacking, the whole world belongs to you.","The flame that burns Twice as bright burns half as long.","Act without expectation.","The sage does not attempt anything very big, and thus achieves greatness.","The universe is deathless; Is deathless because, having no finite self, it stays infinite. A sound man by not advancing himself stays the further ahead of himself, By not confining himself to himself sustains himself outside himself: By never being an end in himself he endlessly becomes himself.","Goodie-goodies are the thieves of virtue.","To see things in the seed, that is genius.","Without the tao, Kindness and compassion are replaced by law and justice; Faith and trust are supplanted by ritual and ceremony.","The moment truth is asserted, it becomes false.","Moderation means prevention. Prevention means achieving much virtue.","Prepare for the difficult while it is still easy. Deal with the big while it is still small. Difficult undertakings have always started with what easy. Great undertakings always started with what is small. Therefore the sage never strives for the great,And thereby the great is achieved.","True perfection seems imperfect,\\nyet it is perfectly itself.\\nTrue fullness seems empty,\\nyet it is fully present.\\nTrue straightness seems crooked.\\nTrue wisdom seems foolish.\\nTrue art seems artless.\\nThe Master allows things to happen.\\nShe shapes events as they come.\\nShe steps out of the way\\nand lets the Tao speak for itself.","All streams flow to the sea because it is lower than they are. Humility gives it its power. If you want to govern the people, you must place yourself below them. If you want to lead the people, you must learn how to follow them. The Master is above the people, and no one feels oppressed. She goes ahead of the people, and no one feels manipulated. The whole world is grateful to her. Because she competes with no one, no one can compete with her.","Knowing that we don\'t know it\'s humility; thinking that we know what we don\'t know, is sickness.","People in their handlings of affairs often fail when they are about to succeed. If one remains as careful at the end as he was at the beginning, there will be no failure.","Remember: if you can cease all restless activity, your integral nature will appear.","There is no need to run outside for better seeing... Rather abide at the center of your being; For the more you leave it the less you learn. Search your heart and see... The way to do is to be.","The truest sayings are paradoxical.","Because every portion of the body, mind, and spirit yearns for the integration of yin and yang, angelic intercourse is led by the spirit rather than the sexual organs. . . . Where ordinary intercourse unites sex organs with sex organs, angelic cultivation unites spirit with spirit, mind with mind, and every cell of one body with every cell of the other body.","If you never assume importance, you never lose it.","Failure is the foundation of success: success is the lurking place of failure.","The weak overcomes the strong. The soft overcomes the hard. Everybody in the world knows this, still nobody makes use of it.","The mark of a moderate man is freedom from his own ideas. Tolerant like the sky, all-pervading like sunlight, firm like a mountain, supple like a tree in the wind, he has no destination in view and makes use of anything life happens to bring his way.","The great image lacks shape.","That so few understand me is why I am treasured.","Stillness overcomes heat.","Instead of being afraid of death, we should try to awake to life; and the only death we should escape from is to forget the presence of God into us.","The things that have acquired unity are these: Heaven by unity has become clear; Earth by unity has become steady; The Spirit by unity has become spiritual; The Valley by unity has become full; All things by unity have come into existence.","By steadily disciplining the animal nature, until it becomes one pointed, it is possible to establish conscious awareness of The Eternal.","The mystical techniques for achieving immortality are revealed only to those who have dissolved all ties to the gross worldly realm of duality, conflict, and dogma. As long as your shallow worldly ambitions exist, the door will not open.","Great talents ripen late; the highest notes are hard to hear.","Nurture the spontaneous peaceful life.","The usefulness of the pot lies in its emptiness.","To know how little one knows is to have genuine knowledge. Not to know how little one knows is to be deluded. Only those who know when they are deluded can free themselves from such delusion. The intelligent people are not deluded, because they know and accept their ignorance as ignorance, and thereby have genuine knowledge.","It is hidden but always present.","People are difficult to rule, because of their knowledge.","By following this simple path, you become extraordinary, unfathomable, a being of profound cosmic subtlety. You outlive time and space by realizing the subtle truth of the universe.","Everything in the universe is created from something, which in turn is created from nothing.","The value comes from what is there, but the use comes from what is not there.","Understand this if nothing else: spiritual freedom and oneness with the Tao are not randomly bestowed gifts, but the rewards of conscious self-transformation and self-evolution.","A good traveler has no fixed plans and is not intent upon arriving. A good artist lets his intuition lead him wherever it wants. A good scientist has freed himself of concepts and keeps his mind open to what is.","To produce things and to rear them,\\nTo produce, but not to take possession of them,\\nTo act, but not to rely on one\'s own ability,\\nTo lead them, but not to master them -\\nThis is called profound and secret virtue.","A tree that cannot bend will crack in the wind. Thus by nature\'s own decree, the soft and gentle are triumphant.","Behave simply and hold on to purity.","The way to use life is to do nothing through acting, The way to use life is to do everything through being.","Conquering others takes force, conquering yourself is true strength.","Confidence is the greatest friend.","When pure sincerity forms within, it is outwardly realized in other people\'s hearts.","On the one hand, loss implies gain; on the other hand, gain implies loss.","When people see some things as good, other things become bad.","Every step is on the path.","Why not simply honor your parents, love your children, help your brothers and sisters, be faithful to your friends, care for your mate with devotion, complete your work cooperatively and joyfully, assume responsibility for problems, practice virtue without first demanding it of others, understand the highest truths yet retain an ordinary manner? That would be true clarity, true simplicity, true mastery.","Do nondoing, strive for non-stiving, savor the flavourless, make much of little, repay enmity with virture; plan for difficulty when it is still easy, do the great while it is still small.","Virtue in its grandest aspect is neither more nor less than following reason.","Distortion upon distortion: . . . the more one uses the mind, the more confused one becomes.","If good happens, good; if bad happens, good.","The True Person avoids extremes, self-indulgence, and extravagance.","Those who have knowledge, don\'t predict. Those who predict, don\'t have knowledge.","Why separate your spiritual life and your practical life? To an integral being, there is no such distinction.","He who defends with love will be secure; Heaven will save him, and protect him with love.","Find a teacher who is an integral being, a beacon who extends his light and virtue with equal ease to those who appreciate him and those who don\'t. Shape yourself in his mold, bathe in his nourishing radiance, and reflect it out to the rest of the world.","Peacefulness is an inner sense of calm - it comes from becoming still - in order to reflect and meditate on our inner wisdom and receive answers. A peaceful heart is one that is free from worry and rouble. It\'s becoming quiet so we can look at things quietly so we can more clearly understand them and thus come up with creative solutions. It is learning to live in the present. Freedom from desire leads to inner peace.",". . . the mind is desperate to fix the river {of events} in place: Possessed by ideas of the past, preoccupied with images of the future, it overlooks the plain truth of the moment.","The fourth (of the four cardinal virtues) is supportiveness: this manifests as service to others without expectation of reward. (Paraphrased: Such service is not a mere conforming to some external rule of behavior, but instead a manifestation of your original nature).","Hold on to the center and make up your mind to rejoice in this paradise called life.","He who regards many things easy will find many difficulties. Therefore the sage regards things difficult, and consequently never has difficulties.","Close your mouth,\\nblock off your senses,\\nblunt your sharpness,\\nuntie your knots,\\nsoften your glare,\\nsettle your dust.\\nThis is the primal identity.","Anticipate the difficult by managing the easy.","When merit has been achieved, do not take it to yourself; for if you do not take it to yourself, it shall never be taken from you.","No weapon is sharper than will.","Although most people spend their entire lives following this biological impulse (i.e. the sex drive), it is only a tiny portion of our beings. . . . If we remain obsessed with seeds and eggs, we are married to the fertile reproductive valley of the Mysterious Mother but not to her immeasurable heart and all-knowing mind.","Things flourish, then each returns to its root. Returning to the root is called stillness: Stillness is called return to life, return to life is called the constant; knowing the constant is called enlightenment.","Truth sounds paradoxical!","Free from desire, you realize the mystery.","Surrender your self-interest. Love others as much as you love yourself. Then you can be entrusted with all things under heaven.","The sense organs, which are limited in scope and ability, randomly gather information. This partial information is arranged into judgments, which are based on previous judgments, which are usually based on someone else\'s foolish ideas. These false concepts and ideas are then stored in a highly selective memory system.","A skillful commander is not overbearing. A skillful fighter does not become angry. A skillful conqueror does not compete with people. One who is skillful in using men puts himself below them. This is called the strength to use men. This is called matching Heaven, The highest principle of old.","If you wish to become a divine immortal angel, then restore the angelic qualities of your being through virtue and service. This is the only way to gain the attention of the immortals... These angelic teachers cannot be sought out; it is they who seek out the student. When you succeed in connecting your energy with the divine realm through high awareness and the practice of undiscriminating virtue, the transmission of the ultimate subtle truths will follow.","Without opening your door, you can open your heart to the world. Without looking out your window, you can see the essence of the Tao. The more you know, the less you understand. The Master arrives without leaving, sees the light without looking, achieves without doing a thing.","Quiet your mind and stop judging and resisting and manipulating the natural way.","Don\'t impose your will through manipulation of aggressive emotions and actions.","I let go of all desire for the common good, and the good becomes as common as the grass.","Ordinary men hate solitude. But the Master makes use of it, embracing his aloneness, realizing he is one with the whole universe.","Some help others in order to receive blessings and admiration. This is simply meaningless. Some cultivate themselves in part to serve others, in part to serve their own pride. They will understand, at best, half of the truth. But those who improve themselves for the sake of the world - to these, the whole truth of the universe will be revealed.","The wise are not learned, the learned are not wise.","That which is achieved the most, still has the whole of its future yet to be achieved.","Water is fluid, soft, and yielding. But water will wear away rock, which is rigid and cannot yield. As a rule, whatever is fluid, soft, and yielding will overcome whatever is rigid and hard. This is another paradox: what is soft is strong.","A scholar who cherishes the love of comfort is not fit to be deemed a scholar.","The cords of passion and desire weave a binding net around you. Worldly confrontation makes you stiff and inflexible. The trap of duality is tenacious. Bound, rigid, and trapped, you cannot experience liberation.","We go from birth to death. Three out of ten follow life. Three out of ten follow death. People who rush from birth to death are also three out of ten. Why is that so? Because they want to make too much of life.","A great nation is like a great man:When he makes a mistake, he realizes it.Having realized it, he admits it.Having admitted it, he corrects it.He considers those who point out his faultsas his most benevolent teachers.He thinks of his enemyas the shadow that he himself casts.","Truly, only those who see illness as illness can avoid illness.","The Tao is infinite, eternal. Why is it eternal? It was never born; thus it can never die. Why is it infinite? It has no desires for itself; thus it is present for all beings. The Master stays behind; that is why she is ahead. She is detached from all things; that is why she is one with them. Because she has let go of herself, she is perfectly fulfilled.","If you go searching for the Great Creator, you will come back empty-handed. The source of the universe is ultimately unknowable, a great invisible river flowing forever through a vast and fertile valley. Silent and uncreated, it creates all things.","Hear no evil. See no evil. Speak no evil.","The highest tone is hard to hear.","Chanting is no more holy than listening to the murmur of a stream, counting prayer beads no more sacred than simply breathing. . . . If you wish to attain oneness with the Tao, don\'t get caught up in spiritual superficialities.","The sage is sharp but does not cut, pointed but does not pierce, forthright but does not offend, bright but does not dazzle.",". . . learn to value what is important today in the subtle realm rather than what appears desirable tomorrow in the worldly realm.","The transformation toward eternal life is gradual. The heavy gross energy of body, mind, and spirit must first be purified and uplifted. When the energy ascends... then self mastery can be sought.","Take time to listen to what is said without words, to obey the law too subtle to be written, to worship the unnameable and to embrace the unformed.","The sage is not ill, because he sees illness as illness.","The master understands that the universe is forever out of control","From now back to antiquity, its (Tao\'s) name has not been lost. Thereby, see the origin of all.","The mature person perceives the fruitlessness of rigid, external methodologies; Remembering this, he keeps his attitude unstructured at all times and thus is always free to pursue the Integral Way. He studies the teachings of the masters. He dissolves all concepts of duality. He pours himself out in service to others.","To be learned, add something each day. To be enlightened drop something each day.","Love the whole world as if it were your self; then you will truly care for all things.","Watch your thoughts, they become words.","If you can let go of (the Tao) with your mind and surround it with your heart, it will live inside you forever.","Other people are occupied, I alone am unwilling, like the outcast.","Give evil nothing to oppose and it will disappear by itself.","Face the simple fact before it comes involved. Solve the small problem before it becomes big.","Seek not happiness too greedily and be not fearful of happiness.","Those who flow as life flows know they need no other force.","Reputation should be neither sought nor avoided.","Not all spiritual paths lead to the harmonious Oneness. Indeed, most are detours and distractions, nothing more.","Your name or your body, what is dearer? Your body or your wealth, what is worthier?","Governing a large country is like frying a small fish. You spoil it with too much poking.","The wise trusts not only to his physical eyes - thus he can see clearly.","What is well planted will not be uprooted.","The Tao gives birth to One. One gives birth to Two. Two gives birth to Three. Three gives birth to all things. All things have their backs to the female and stand facing the male. When male and female combine, all things achieve harmony. Ordinary men hate solitude. But the Master makes use of it, embracing his aloneness, realizing he is one with the whole universe.","The great Way is all-pervading. It reaches to the left and to the right. All things depend on it with their existence. Still it demands no obedience.","Everything will settle in its own place automatically.","True power is stillness within motion.","Peace is our natural state of being.","He who accounts all things easy will have many difficulties.","In dwelling, be close to the land. In meditation, go deep in the heart.","The superior leader keeps informed about everything but interferes hardly at all.","The best leaders are those their people hardly know exist.\\nThe next best is a leader who is loved and praised.\\nNext comes the one who is feared.\\nThe worst one is the leader that is despised ...\\nThe best leaders value their words, and use them sparingly.\\nWhen they have accomplished their task,\\nthe people say, \\"Amazing!\\nWe did it, all by ourselves!","He who has achieved this state Is unconcerned with friends and enemies, With good and harm, with honor and disgrace. This therefore is the highest state of man.","The most difficult in the world must be easy in its beginning.","Let things flow naturally forward in whatever way they like.","When wisdom and knowledge appear, great pretense arises.","The wise man knows without traveling.","I do not act, and people become reformed by themselves.","Whoever relies on the Tao in governing men doesn\'t try to force issues or defeat enemies by force of arms. For every force there is a counterforce. Violence, even well intentioned, always rebounds upon oneself. The Master does his job and then stops. He understands that the universe is forever out of control, and that trying to dominate events goes against the current of the Tao. Because he believes in himself, he doesn\'t try to convince others. Because he is content with himself, he doesn\'t need others\' approval. Because he accepts himself, the whole world accepts him.","Be gentle and you can be bold; be frugal and you can be liberal; avoid putting yourself before others and you can become a leader among men.","He who steals a hook shall be hanged; while he who steals the state shall be crowned as prince.","When you have accomplished your goal simply walk away. This is the path way to Heaven.",". . . These are notions of the mind, which is like a knife, always chipping away at the Tao, trying to render it graspable and manageable. But that which is beyond form is ungraspable, and that which is beyond knowing is unmanageable. There is, however, this consolation: She who lets go of the knife will find the Tao at her fingertips.","Freedom from desire leads to inner peace.","Seeing the small is called Clarity.\\nKeeping flexible is called Strength.\\nUsing the shining Radiance,\\nYou enter the Light,\\nWhere no harm can come to you.\\nThis is called Enlightenment.","Follow diligently the Way in your own heart, but make no display of it to the world.","Can you step back from your own mind and thus understand all things?","Knowing constancy, the mind is open.\\nWith an open mind, you will be openhearted.\\nBeing openhearted you will act royally.\\nBeing royal, you will attain the divine.\\nBeing divine, you will be at one with the Tao.\\nBeing at one with the Tao is eternal. \\nThough the body dies, the Tao will never pass away.","If people are not afraid of dying, why threaten them with death?","Governing a large country is like frying a small fish. You spoil it with too much poking. Center your country in the Tao and evil will have no power. Not that it isn\'t there, but you\'ll be able to step out of its way. Give evil nothing to oppose and it will disappear by itself.","...the more you talk of it, the less you understand.","The new life created by the final integration is self-aware yet without ego, capable of inhabiting a body yet not attached to it, and guided by wisdom rather than emotion. Whole and virtuous, it can never die.","Can you let go of words and ideas, attitudes and expectations? If so, then the Tao will loom into view.","...The sage, traveling all day, Does not lose sight of his baggage. Though there are beautiful things to be seen, He remains unattached and calm.","Acting without design, occupying oneself without making a business of it, finding the great in what is small and the many in the few, repaying injury with kindness, effecting difficult things while they are easy, and managing great things in their beginnings; this is the method of Tao.","My teachings are easy to understand and easy to put into practice. Yet your intellect will never grasp them, and if you try to practice them, you\'ll fail. My teachings are older than the world. How can you grasp their meaning? If you want to know me, look inside your heart.","The sage acts without taking credit. He accomplishes without dwelling on it. He does not want to display his worth.","He who gains a victory over other men is strong; but he who gains a victory over himself is all powerful.","When nothing is done, nothing is left undone.","Things exalted then decay. This is going against the Way. What goes against the Way meets an early end.","Strong winds do not last all morning, hard rains do not last all day.","It is as though he listened and such listening as his enfolds us in silence in which at last we begin to hear what we are meant to be.","The value of actions lies in their timing.","One who is too insistent on his own views, finds few to agree with him.","What has no substance can penetrate what has no opening.","Respond intelligently even to unintelligent treatment.","Sincere words are not fine; fine words are not sincere. Those who are skilled (in the Tao) do not dispute (about it); the disputatious are not skilled in it. Those who know (the Tao) are not extensively learned; the extensively learned do not know it.","Do you imagine the universe is agitated? Go into the desert at night and look out at the stars. This practice should answer the question..... The master settles her mind as the universe settles the stars in the sky. By connecting her mind with the subtle origin, she calms it. Once calmed, it naturally expands, and ultimately her mind becomes as vast and immeasurable as the night sky.","How do I know about the world?  By what is within me.","Realize thy Simple Self, Embrace thy Original Nature.","But in the present day men cast off gentleness, and are all for being bold; they spurn frugality, and retain only extravagance; they discard humility, and aim only at being first. Therefore they shall surely perish.","When you stand with your two feet on the ground, you will always keep your balance.","Hold on to the ancient Way to master the present, and to learn the distant beginning.","Once you arrive {at a spontaneous awareness of the Great Oneness}, remember: it isn\'t necessary to struggle to maintain unity with it. All you have to do is participate in it.","Success is as dangerous as failure. Hope is as hollow as fear.","When one gives whatever one can without restraint, the barriers of individuality break down. It no longer becomes possible to tell whether it is the student offering himself to the teacher, or the teacher offering herself to the student. One sees only two immaculate beings, reflecting one another like a pair of brilliant mirrors.","Can you dissolve your ego? Can you abandon the idea of self and other? Can you relinquish the notions of male and female, short and long, life and death? Can you let go of all these dualities and embrace the Tao without skepticism or panic? If so, you can reach the heart of the Integral Oneness.","Hope and fear are both phantoms that arise from thinking of the self. When we don\'t see the self as self, what do we have to fear?","The most eloquent seems to stutter.","To bear and not to own; to act and not lay claim; to do the work and let it go: for just letting it go is what makes it stay.","When there is no desire, all things are at peace","Conquering others requires force. Conquering oneself requires strength","The more you know the less you understand.","The more clever and cunning people are, the stranger the events will be.","The river and the sea can be kings of a hundred valleys, because they lie below them.","There was something that finished chaos, born before Heaven and Earth.","Being deeply loved by someone gives you strength, while loving someone deeply gives you courage.","A good traveler leaves no tracks. Good speech lacks fault-finding.","If you scramble about in search of inner peace, you will lose your inner peace.","The Great Vessel takes long to complete.","Make the small big and the few many.","If you see what is small as it sees itself, and accept what is weak for what strength it has, and use what is dim for the light it gives then all will go well. This is called Acting Naturally.","First and last follow each other.","The more laws and restrictions there are, \\nThe poorer people become. \\nThe sharper men\'s weapons, \\nThe more trouble in the land.","Be truly whole, and all things will return to you.","Act without doing; work without effort. Think of the small as large and the few as many. Confront the difficult while it is still easy; accomplish the great task by a series of small acts. The Master never reaches for the great; thus she achieves greatness. When she runs into a difficulty, she stops and gives herself to it. She doesn\'t cling to her own comfort; thus problems are no problem for her.","The ancient Masters didn\'t try to educate the people, but kindly taught them to not-know. When they think that they know the answers, people are difficult to guide. When they know that they don\'t know, people can find their own way. If you want to learn how to govern, avoid being clever or rich. The simplest pattern is the clearest. Content with an ordinary life, you can show all people the way back to their own true nature.","Kindness in giving creates love.","The people are hungry: It is because those in authority eat up too much in taxes.","When a country is in harmony with the Tao, the factories make trucks and tractors. When a country goes counter to the Tao, warheads are stockpiled outside the cities. There is no greater illusion than fear, no greater wrong than preparing to defend yourself, no greater misfortune than having an enemy. Whoever can see through all fear will always be safe.","The man of knowledge acquires something new everyday, and the man of Tao lets go of something new every day.","Be as the still mountain; Move like the great river.","Men are born soft and supple; dead, they are stiff and hard. Plants are born tender and pliant; dead, they are brittle and dry. Thus whoever is stiff and inflexible is a disciple of death. Whoever is soft and yielding is a disciple of life. The hard and stiff will be broken. The soft and supple will prevail.","The mature person perceives the fruitlessness of rigid, external methodologies.","The sage avoids extremity, excess, and extravagance.","Those who would take over the earth and shape it to their will, never, I notice succeed.","Returning to the source is stillness. It is returning to one\'s fate. Returning to one\'s fate is eternal.","When you find the way/ others will find you./ Passing by on the road/ they will be drawn to your door./ The way that cannot be heard/ will be echoed in your voice./ The way that cannot be seen/ will be reflected in your eyes.","If lightning is the anger of the gods, then the gods are concerned mostly about trees.","The key to growth is the introduction of higher dimensions of consciousness into our awareness.","In order to contract, It is necessary first to expand. In order to weaken, It is necessary first to strengthen. In order to destroy, It is first necessary to promote. In order to grasp, It is necessary first to give. This is called subtle light. The weak and the tender overcome the hard and the strong.","He who obtains has little. He who scatters has much.","Never take over the world to tamper with it. Those who want to tamper with it are not fit to take over the world.","The sage has no concern for himself, but makes the concerns of others his own.","Knowledge of the eternal is all-embracing. To be all-embracing leads to righteousness, which is majestic.","Peace and quiet are preferred. Victory should not be praised.","If I have even just a little sense, I will walk on the main road and my only fear will be of straying from it. Keeping to the main road is easy, But people love to be sidetracked.","Softness triumphs over hardness, feebleness over strength. What is more malleable is always superior over that which is immoveable. This is the principle of controlling things by going along with them, of mastery through adaptation.","A good traveler has no fixed plans, and is not intent on arriving.","Having reached a high level of realization (or having accomplished anything in life), don\'t get excited or puffed up with pride but remain calm, humble, and in \\"perfect equanimity\\" if you want to continue in this deep state of consciousness.","Accept disgrace willingly... Accept being unimportant... Surrender yourself humbly; then you can be trusted to care for all things. Love the world as your own self; then you can truly care for all things.","What makes a kingdom great is its being like a down-flowing river,--the central point towards which all the smaller streams under Heaven converge; or like the female throughout the world, who by quiescence always overcomes the male. And quiescence is a form of humility.","To realize that our knowledge is ignorance, This is a noble insight. To regard our ignorance as knowledge, This is mental sickness. Only when we are sick of the sickness Shall we cease to be sick. The Sage is not sick, being sick of sickness; This is the secret of health.","A good runner leaves no footprints.","The men who are great live with that which is substantial, they do not stay with that which is superficial; they abide with realities, they do not remain with what is showy. The one they discard, the other they hold.","Therefore the Sage, wishing to be above the people, must by his words put himself below them; wishing to be before the people, he must put himself behind them. In this way, though he has his place above them, the people do not feel his weight; though he has his place before them, they do not feel it as an injury. Therefore all mankind delight to exalt him, and weary of him not.","The great Way is very straight, but people prefer to deviate.","My words are very easy to understand and very easy to practice; but there is no one in the world who is able to understand and practice them.","The nameless is the beginning of Heaven and Earth. The named is the mother of all things.","The real art of governing consists, so far as possible, in doing nothing.","What is firmly rooted cannot be pulled out","Truthful words are not beautiful; beautiful words are not truthful. Good words are not persuasive; persuasive words are not good.","Empty your mind of all thoughts.","He who regards the world as he does the fortune of his own body can govern the world. He who loves the world as he does his own body can be entrusted with the world.","All things of the world are born of being; being is born of nonbeing.","A tree trunk the size of a man grows from a blade as thin as a hair. A tower nine stories high is built from a small heap of earth.","From wonder into wonder existence opens.","The sage knows without traveling, perceives without looking, completes without acting.","The sturdiest virtue seems fragile.","To practice virtue is to selflessly offer assistance to others, giving without limitation one\'s time, abilities, and possessions in service, whenever and wherever needed, without prejudice concerning the identity of those in need.","When family ties are disturbed, devoted children arise.","One cannot reflect in streaming water. Only those who know internal peace can give it to others.","Tao is beyond words and beyond understanding. Words may be used to speak of it, but they cannot contain it. Tao existed before words and names, before heaven and earth, before the ten thousand things. It is the unlimited father and mother of all limited things. Therefore, to see beyond boundaries to the subtle heart of things, dispense with names, with concepts, with expectations and ambitions and differences. Tao and its many manifestations arise from the same source: subtle wonder within mysterious darkness. This is the beginning of all understanding.","In this world, there is nothing softer or thinner than water. But to compel the hard and unyielding, it has no equal. That the weak overcomes the strong, that the hard gives way to the gentle - this everyone knows. Yet no one asks accordingly.","The Master\'s power is like this. He lets all things come and go effortlessly, without desire. He never expects results; thus he is never disappointed. He is never disappointed; thus his spirit never grows old.","Pride attaches undue importance to the superiority of one\'s status in the eyes of others; and shame is fear of humiliation at one\'s inferior status in the estimation of others. When one sets one\'s heart on being highly esteemed, and achieves such rating, then he or she is automatically involved in fear of losing status.","When everyone in the world sees beauty, then ugly exists.","I have the mind of a fool, understanding nothing.","The softest things in the world overcome the hardest things in the world. Through this I know the advantage of taking no action.","Without desire there is stillness, and the world settles by itself.","The Master keeps her mind always at one with the Tao; that is what gives her her radiance. The Tao is ungraspable. How can her mind be at one with it? Because she doesn\'t cling to ideas. The Tao is dark and unfathomable. How can it make her radiant? Because she lets it. Since before time and space were, the Tao is. It is beyond is and is not. How do I know this is true? I look inside myself and see.","Those who defeat others are strong, those who defeat themselves are mighty.","Letting the mind control the vital breath is called force.","What honor can there be without humility?      What heights can be reached without being low? The pieces of a chariot are useless       unless the work in accordance with the whole A man\'s life brings nothing       unless he lives in accordance with the whole universe Playing one\'s part      in accordance with the universe      is true humility So whether you\'re a gem in the royal court    or a stone on the common path If you accept your part with humility    the glory of the universe will be yours","He who loves does not dispute: He who disputes does not love.","Knowing honor, but clinging to disgrace, you become the valley of the world.","If the sage wants to stand above people, he must speak to them from below. If he wants to lead people, he must follow them from behind.","Simple, like uncarved wood.","Of all that is good, sublimity is supreme. Succeeding is the coming together of all that is beautiful. Furtherance is the agreement of all that is just. Perseverance is the foundation of all actions.","I alone have the mind of a fool, and am all muddled and vague. The people are so smart and bright. While I am just dull and confused.","Who is unhappy with little, won\'t be with much; who doesn\'t appreciate the small won\'t be able to take care of the large; who doesn\'t have enough with enough is at the margin or virtue, for the physical body lives from one day to another and if it gets what it really needs, there will be time for meditation, as long as if we try to give it everything it desires, endless will be the task.","A tree that is unbending, is easily broken.","To manage your mind, know that there is nothing, and then relinquish all attachment to nothingness.","A leader is best when people barely know he exists, when his work is done, his aim fulfilled, they will say: we did it ourselves.","No thought, no action, no movement, total stillness: only thus can one manifest the true nature and law of things from within and unconsciously, and at last become one with heaven and earth.","When virtue is lost, benevolence appears, when benevolence is lost right conduct appears, when right conduct is lost, expedience appears. Expediency is the mere shadow of right and truth; it is the beginning of disorder.","(The Tao) is always present and always available. . . . If you are willing to be lived by it, you will see it everywhere, even in the most ordinary things.","The Tao doesn\'t take sides; it gives birth to both good and evil. The Master doesn\'t take sides; she welcomes both saints and sinners. The Tao is like a bellows: it is empty yet infinitely capable. The more you use it, the more it produces; the more you talk of it, the less you understand. Hold on to the center.","Giving to others selflesly and anonymously, radiating light throughout the world and illuminating your own darkness, your virtue becomes a sanctuary for yourself and all beings.","An ant on the move does more than a dozing ox.","Lightly given promises must meet with little trust.","The way is light and fluid for the man with\\nno preferences.","I am at peace, and people become fair by themselves.","Weapons are instruments of fear; they are not a wise man\'s tools. He uses them only when he has no choice.","The most straight seems curved.","Those who know are wise. Those who know themselves are enlightened.","Regardless of how you feel inside, always try to look like a winner. Even if you are behind, a sustained look of control and confidence can give you a mental edge that results in victory. - Diane Arbus By letting it go it all gets done. The world is won by those who let it go. But when you try and try. The world is beyond the winning.","The world\'s beginning is its mother. To have found the mother is also to know the children. Although you know the children, cling to the mother. Until your last day you will not be harmed.","He who knows himself is enlightened.","Geese are white, crows are black.  No argument will change this.","Knowing others is intelligence; knowing yourself is true wisdom. Mastering others is strength; mastering yourself is true power.","I confess that there is nothing to teach: no religion, no science, no writings which will lead your mind back to Spirit. Today I speak this way, tomorrow that, but always the Path is beyond words and beyond mind.","The Master gives himself up to whatever the moment brings. He knows that he is going to die, and her has nothing left to hold on to: no illusions in his mind, no resistances in his body. He doesn\'t think about his actions; they flow from the core of his being. He holds nothing back from life; therefore he is ready for death, as a man is ready for sleep after a good day\'s work.","The ego is entranced by ... names and ideas... However names and concepts only block your perception of this Great Oneness. Therefore it is wise to ignore them. Those who live inside their egos are continually bewildered.","The Tao gives birth to One. One gives birth to yin and yang. Yin and yang give birth to all things... The complete whole is the complete whole. So also is any part the complete whole... But forget about understanding and harmonizing and making all things one. The universe is already a harmonious oneness; just realize it.","The best way to carve is not to split.","The best athlete wants his opponent at his best. The best general enters the mind of his enemy. The best businessman serves the communal good. The best leader follows the will of the people. All of the embody the virtue of non-competition. Not that they don\'t love to compete, but they do it in the spirit of play. In this they are like children and in harmony with the Tao.","The supreme good is like water, which nourishes all things without trying to. It is content with the low places that people disdain. Thus it is like the Tao. In dwelling, live close to the ground. In thinking, keep to the simple. In conflict, be fair and generous. In governing, don\'t try to control. In work, do what you enjoy. In family life, be completely present. When you are content to be simply yourself and don\'t compare or compete, everybody will respect you.","Misery is what happiness rests upon. Happiness is what misery lurks beneath.","The softest of stuff in the world, penetrates quickly the hardest, insubstantial, it enters where there is no room.","The best fighter is never angry.","Does one scent appeal more than another? Do you prefer this flavor, or that feeling? Is your practice sacred and your work profane? Then your mind is separated: from itself, from oneness, from the Tao.","A multitude of words is tiresome, unlike remaining centered.","The highest virtue does nothing. Yet, nothing needs to be done. The lowest virtue does everything. Yet, much remains to be done.","What is and what is not create each other.","The world is a sacred vessel that cannot be changed. He who changes it will destroy it. He who seizes it will lose it.","Not praising the deserving prevents envy.","The Sage expects no recognition for what he does; he achieves merit but does not take it to himself; he does not wish to display his worth.","We hammer wood for a house, but it is the inner space that makes it liveable.","I observe myself and I come to know others.","The words of truth are always paradoxical. To the mind that is still, the whole universe surrenders.","All things in the world come from being. And being comes from non-being.","Clay is used to make vases, but it is the emptiness they contain that makes them useful.","The sage acts by doing nothing.","The best soldiers are not warlike; the best fighters do not lose their temper. The greatest conquerors are those who overcome their enemies without strife. The greatest directors of men are those who yield place to others. This is called the Virtue of not striving, the capacity for directing mankind; this is being the compeer of Heaven. It was the highest goal of the ancients.","I do not interfere, and people become rich by themselves.","Meandering leads to perfection.","Govern a great nation as you would cook a small fish. Do not overdo it.","The generals have a saying: \\"Rather than make the first move it is better to wait and see. Rather than advance an inch it is better to retreat a yard.\\" This is called going forward without advancing, pushing back without using weapons. There is no greater misfortune than underestimating your enemy. Underestimating your enemy means thinking that he is evil. Thus you destroy your three treasures and become an enemy yourself. When two great forces oppose each other, the victory will go to the one that knows how to yield.","We desire to understand the world by giving names to the things we see, but these things are only the effects of something subtle.","The sage never strives for greatness, and can therefore accomplish greatness.","The Way to do is to be.","Treat the large as the small and the few as the many.","Do your work, then step back. The only path to serenity.","Praise of power leads to weakness; Love of things leads to loss; The wise one leads by filling people\'s hearts; He destroys illusion and disturbs those who believe they are wise; He does nothing yet everything happens.","The one who is conscious (in Tao) can\'t speak. The one who can speak is not conscious (centered in Tao)","There is no greater crime than desire.","A man\'s excellence is like that of water; It benefits all things without striving; It takes to the low places shunned by men. Water is akin to Tao. . . . In all the earth nothing weaker than water, Yet in attacking the hard, nothing superior, Nothing so certain in wearing down strength: There is no way to resist it. Note then: The weak conquer the strong, The yielding outlast the aggressors.","If there is to be peace in the home, There must be peace in the heart.","Be humble and you will remain entire. The sages do not display themselves, therefore they shine. They do not approve themselves, therefore they are noted. They do not praise themselves, therefore they have merit. They do not glory in themselves, therefore they excel.","The Tao\'s principle is spontaneity.","Darkness within darkness. The gateway to all understanding.","Do you think you can make the world a better place? I do not think you can. It is already perfect.","Greed for enlightenment and immortality is no different than greed for material wealth. It is self-centered and dualistic, and thus an obstacle to true attainment. Therefore these states are never achieved by those who covet them; rather, they are the reward of the virtuous.","The heavy is the root of the light. The tranquil is the ruler of the hasty.","If you realize that all things change, there is nothing you will try to hold on to. If you aren\'t afraid of dying, there is nothing you can\'t achieve. Trying to control the future is like trying to take the master carpenter\'s place. When you handle the master carpenter\'s tools, chances are that you\'ll cut your hand.","Those who are one with deprivation are deprived of deprivation.","Greed is costly. Assembled fortunes are lost.","The purest white seems stained.","Take [preventive] action before things happen. Establish order before disorder has begun.","The highest virtue is not virtuous. Therefore it has virtue. The lowest virtue holds on to virtue. Therefore it has no virtue.","The greatest virtue is to follow the Way utterly.","Is not the action of nature like the stretching of a bow? The high, it pulls down; the low, it lifts up; It takes from what is in excess In order to make good of what is deficient. Who can take what they have in excess and offer it to others?","To lead, one must follow.","Those who are content suffer no disgrace.","Yet mystery and reality emerge from the same source.","Each new day is a blank page in the diary of your life. The secret of success is in turning that diary into the best story you possibly can. I wish you Happy New Year and diary full of best stories ever written in your life.","Goodness strives not, and therefore it is not rebuked.","Perfect kindness acts without thinking of kindness.","Intellectual knowledge exists in and of the brain. Because the brain is part of the body, which must one day expire, this collection of facts, however large and impressive, will expire as well. {But spiritual insight transcends death.}","The sage does not act and therefore does not fail, does not seize and therefore does not lose.","Let the country be small, and the inhabitants few.","Worlds and particles, bodies and beings, time and space: All are transient expressions of the Tao.","There is no greater danger than underestimating your opponent.","He who is attached to things will suffer much.","Quarrel with a friend - and you are both wrong.","Speaking with kindness creates confidence, thinking with kindness creates profoundness, giving with kindness creates love.","How can a man\'s life keep it\'s course If he will not let it flow, Those who flow as life flows know They need no other force: They feel no wear, they feel no tear, They need no mending, no repair.","Those who know it do not speak about it. Those who speak about it do not know it.","The reason why rivers and seas are able to be lords over a hundred mountain streams, is that they know how to keep below them. That is why they are able to reign over all the mountain streams.","The Way is ever without action, yet nothing is left undone.","Cultivate virtue in the world, and it will be universal.","Can you comprehend everything in the four directions and still do nothing?","My words have an origin. My deeds have a sovereign. Truly, because people do not understand this, they do not understand me.","A vessel is formed from a lump of clay with care, however, it is the empty space within the vessel that makes it useful.","Weapons are the tools of violence;all decent men detest them.Weapons are the tools of fear;a decent man will avoid themexcept in the direst necessityand, if compelled, will use themonly with the utmost restraint.Peace is his highest value.If the peace has been shattered,how can he be content?His enemies are not demons,but human beings like himself.He doesn\'t wish them personal harm.Nor does he rejoice in victory.How could he rejoice in victoryand delight in the slaughter of men?He enters a battle gravely,with sorrow and with great compassion,as if he were attending a funeral","Do not conquer the world with force, for force only causes resistance. Thorns spring up when an army passes. Years of misery follow a great victory. Do only what needs to be done without using violence.","If Heaven were not clear it might rend. If Earth were not firm it might crumble.","By the accident of fortune a man may rule the world for a time, but by virtue of love and kindness he may rule the world forever.","There are three layers to the universe. In the lower, Tai Ching, and the middle, Shan Ching, the hindrance of a physical bodily existence is required. Those who fail to live consistently in accord with the Tao reside here. In the upper, Yu Ching, there is only Tao: the bondage of form is broken, and the only thing existing is the exquisite energy dance of the immortal divine beings.","That which offers no resistance, overcomes the hardest substances.","All things carry yin and embrace yang. They reach harmony by blending with the vital breath.","Silence is a source of great strenght.","There is something obscure which is complete before heaven and earth arose; tranquil, quiet, standing alone without change, moving without peril. It could be the mother of everything. Not knowing its name, I call it Tao.","A foolish man is always doing, Yet much remains to be done.","People turn their eyes and ears to him (the sage), and the sage cares for them like his own children.","An integral being knows without going,\\nsees without looking, and accomplishes without doing.","Words have divided man from woman,\\none from another, this from that,\\nuntil only sages know how to put things together.\\nWithout words, without even understanding,\\nlovers find each other.\\nThe moment of finding is always a surprise,\\nlike meeting an old friend never before known.","The heavy is the root of the light. The unmoved is the source of all movement. Thus the Master travels all day without leaving home. However splendid the views, she stays serenely in herself. Why should the lord of the country flit about like a fool? If you let yourself be blown to and fro, you lose touch with your root. If you let restlessness move you, you lose touch with who you are.","The natural laws of the universe are inviolable... what you say and do determines what happens in your life... You are the master of your life and death. What you do is what you are.","Arms are instruments of ill omen, not the instruments of the gentleman. When one is compelled to use them, it is best to do so without relish.","From What-is all the world of things was born But What-is sprang in turn from What-is-not.","The highest virtue seems as low as a valley.","When they lose their sense of awe, people turn to religion. When they no longer trust themselves, they begin to depend upon authority. Therefore the Master steps back so that people won\'t be confused. He teaches without a teaching, so that people will have nothing to learn.","The Master doesn\'t seek fulfillment. For only those who are not full are able to be used which brings the feeling of completeness.","There is no calamity greater than lightly engaging in war.","The sage does not strive to be great. Thereby he can accomplish the great.","The greatest revelation is stillness.","The superior student listens to the Way and follows it closely. The average student listens to the Way and follows some and some not. The lesser student listens to the Way and laughs out loud. If there were no laughter it would not be the Way.","Knowing the bright, but clinging to the dark, you become a model to the world.","In dwelling, live close to the ground.\\nIn thinking, keep to the simple.\\nIn conflict, be fair and generous.\\nIn governing, don\'t try to control.\\nIn work, do what you enjoy.\\nIn family life, be completely present.","There is no greater sin than desire, No greater curse than discontent, No greater misfortune than wanting something for oneself. Therefore he who knows that enough is enough will always have enough.","Few things under heaven bring more benefit than the lessons learned from silence and the actions taken without striving.","Therefore the Sage embraces Unity, and is a model for all under Heaven. He is free from self-display, therefore he shines forth; from self-assertion, therefore he is distinguished; from self-glorification, therefore he has merit; from self-exaltation, therefore he rises superior to all. Inasmuch as he does not strive, there is no one in the world who can strive with him.","Let muddy water stand and it will become clear.","Kindness in thought leads to wisdom. Kindness in speech leads to eloquence. Kindness in action leads to love.","He who stands on tiptoe is not steady. He who strides cannot maintain the pace. He who makes a show is not enlightened. He who is self-righteous is not respected. He who boasts achieves nothing. He who brags will not endure. According to followers of the Tao, \\"These are extra food and unnecessary luggage.\\" They do not bring happiness, therefore followers of the Tao avoid them.","To conquer others is to have power, to conquer yourself is to know the way.","The scholar gains every day; the man of Tao loses every day.","The well-run group is not a battlefield of egos.","Because he is a living divinity, when he acts, the universe acts.","The ten thousand things flourish and then each returns to the root from which it came. Returning to the root is stillness. Through stillness each fulfils its destiny.","So sometimes things are ahead and sometimes they are behind; Sometimes breathing is hard, sometimes it comes easily; Sometimes there is strength and sometimes weakness; Sometimes one is up and sometimes down. Therefore the sage avoids extremes, excesses, and complacency.","Those who know when it is enough will not perish.","Just as the value of a house lies in its location, The value of a mind lies in its depth, The value of giving lies in the presence of a generous spirit, The value of words lies in their reliability.","Conquering the world and changing it, I do not think it can succeed.","The group will not prosper if the leader grabs the lion\'s share of the credit for the good work that has been done.","If I have just an ounce of sense, I follow the great Way, and fear only to stray from it.","He who holds on to the Way seeks no excess. Since he lacks excess, he can grow old in no need to be renewed.","The wise man looks back into the past, and does not grieve over what is far off, nor rejoice over what is near; for he knows that time is without end.","Heavy is the root of light.","Hold on to the great image, and the whole world follows, follows unharmed, content and completely at peace.","The more sharp weapons people have in a country, the bigger the disorder will be.","Words spoken about the Way have no taste. When looked at, there\'s not enough to see. When listened to, there\'s not enough to hear. When used, it is never exhausted.","If princes and kings were not exalted they might be overthrown.","Therefore, if a great kingdom humbles itself before a small kingdom, it shall make that small kingdom its prize. And if a small kingdom humbles itself before a great kingdom, it shall win over that great kingdom. Thus the one humbles itself in order to attain, the other attains because it is humble. If the great kingdom has no further desire than to bring men together and to nourish them, the small kingdom will have no further desire than to enter the service of the other. But in order that both may have their desire, the great one must learn humility.","Fail to honor people, they fail to honor you.","In the world there is nothing more submissive and weak than water. Yet for attacking that which is hard and strong nothing can surpass it.","Only those who leisurely approach that which the masses are busy about can be busy about that which the masses take leisurely.","Attain utmost emptiness. Abide in steadfast stillness.","True words seem false.","In the Way of Heaven, there is no partiality of love; it is always on the side of the good man.","The sage wears coarse clothes, concealing jade.","The more prohibitions you have, the less virtuous people will be.  The more weapons you have, the less secure people will be.  The more subsidies you have, the less self reliant people will be.","Peace and quiet govern the world.","Without going out-of-doors, one can know all he needs to know. Without even looking out of his window, one can grasp the nature of everything. Without going beyond his own nature, one can achieve ultimate wisdom. Therefore, the intelligent man knows all he needs to know without going away, And sees all he needs to see without looking elsewhere, And does all he needs to do wihout undue exertion.","Who has excess and supplies the world? Only the one who follows the Way.","Do nondoing, strive for nonstriving, savor the flavorless, regard the small as important, make much of little, repay enmity with virtue; plan for difficulty when it is still easy, do the great while it is still small. The most difficult things in the world must be done while they are easy; the greatest things in the world must be done while they are small.","Activity conquers coldness. Stillness conquers heat.","The liberation cannot be reached but by means of the perception of the identity of the individual spirit with the universal spirit.","Gently eliminating all obstacles to his own understanding, he constantly maintains his unconditional sincerity. His humility, perseverance, and adaptability evoke the response of the universe and fill him with divine light.","If you have really attained wholeness, everything will flock to you.","When Simplicity is broken up, it is made into instruments. Evolved individuals who employ them, are made into leaders. In this way, the Great System is United.","By moderation one can be generous.","Abandon wisdom, discard knowledge, and people will benefit a hundredfold.","Always be on the lookout for ways to turn a problem into an opportunity for success. Always be on the lookout for ways to nurture your dream.","Be content with an ordinary life.","The career of a sage is of two kinds: He is either honored by all in the world, Like a flower waving its head, Or else he disappears into the silent forest.","When the hares have all been caught, the hunting dogs are cooked.","When you accurately perceive the fluidity of things, you can also begin to perceive the constancy behind them: the creative, transformative, boundless, immutable Tao.","I find good people good And I find bad people good If I am good enough.","Keep behind, and you shall be put in front; keep out, and you shall be kept in.","Can you care for the people and rule the country and not be cunning?","What is a good man but a bad man\'s teacher? What is a bad man but a good man\'s job? If you do not remember this, You will get lost, No matter how intelligent you are. It is the great secret.","Who can enjoy enlightenment and remain indifferent to suffering in the world? This is not in keeping with the Way. Only those who increase their service along with their understanding can be called men and women of Tao.","He that humbles himself shall be preserved entire. He that bends shall be made straight. He that is empty shall be filled. He that is worn out shall be renewed. He who has little shall succeed. He who has much shall go astray.","Force is followed by loss of strength. This is not the way of the Tao. That which goes against the Tao comes to an early end.","Can you be still and look inside?If so, then you know the truth is always available, and always responsive.","Learn from the people. Plan with the people. Begin with what they have. Build on what they know.","When a nation is filled with strife, then do patriots flourish.","Abandon fancy theologies and imaginary ideas and do some ordinary daily work... {Engage in this work with} unswerving kindness and unending patience.","He who acts, spoils; he who grasps, lets slip.","Displaying riches and titles with pride brings about one\'s downfall.","A tree that can fill the span of a man\'s arms grows from a downy tip; A terrace nine stories high rises from level earth; A journey of a thousand miles starts from beneath one\'s feet.","Too much success is not an advantage.\\nDo not tinkle like jade\\nOr clatter like stone chimes.","What should be shrunken must first be stretched.","The great Way is easy, yet people prefer the side paths. Be aware when things are out of balance. Stay centered within the Tao. When rich speculators prosper While farmers lose their land; when government officials spend money on weapons instead of cures; when the upper class is extravagant and irresponsible while the poor have nowhere to turn- all this is robbery and chaos. It is not in keeping with the Tao.","He who knows enough is enough will always have enough.","The sage regards things as difficult, and thereby avoids difficulty.","Those who praise themselves do not prevail.","The seed of mystery lies in muddy water. How can I perceive this mystery? Water becomes clear through stillness. How can I become still? By flowing with the stream.","Use your own light and return to the source of light. This is called practicing eternity.","ALL things in Nature work silently. They come into being and possess nothing. They fulfil their functions and make no claim.","The farther you go, the less you know.","A good traveler has no fixed plans and is not intent upon arriving. A good artist lets his intuition lead him wherever it wants. A good scientist has freed himself of concepts and keeps his mind open to what is. Thus the Master is available to all people and doesn\'t reject anyone. He is ready to use all situations and doesn\'t waste anything. This is called embodying the light. What is a good man but a bad man\'s teacher? What is a bad man but a good man\'s job? If you don\'t understand this, you will get lost, however intelligent you are. It is the great secret.","Act without striving. Work without interfering. Find the flavour in what is flavourless.","Supreme good is like water. Water greatly benefits all things, without conflict. It flows through places that people loathe. Thereby it is close to the Way.","In ancient times, people said that imperfect moves to becoming perfect. Are these words vain? No! Truly, by gaining Unity you come to Perfection!","Justice has long arm.","He who prides himself upon wealth and honor hastens his own downfall.","The True Person benefits yet expects no reward, does the work and moves on. There is no desire to be considered better than others.","Between yea and nay, how much difference is there?","Without going outside, you may know the whole world, without looking through the window, you may see the ways of heaven. The farther you go, the less you know. Thus the sage knows without traveling; he sees without looking; he works without doing.","Empty your mind of all thoughts. Let your heart be at peace. Watch the turmoil of beings, but contemplate their return.","Shape clay into a vessel; \\nIt is the space within that makes it useful. \\nCut doors and windows for a room; \\nIt is the holes which make it useful. \\nTherefore benefit comes from what is there; \\nUsefulness from what is not there.","Filling life exceedingly is called ominous.","The Master views the parts with compassion, because he understands the whole. His constant practice is humility. He doesn\'t glitter like a jewel but lets himself be shaped by the Tao, as rugged and common as a stone.","Without going outside, you may know the whole world!","When taxes are too high, people go hungry.","The high must make the low its base.","Who can rest until the moment of action?","The sage does not hoard. The more he helps others, the more he benefits himself, The more he gives to others, the more he gets himself. The Way of Heaven does one good but never does one harm. The Way of the sage is to act but not to compete.","If you want to be given everything, give everything up.","Things are not worth attending to, yet they have to be attended to.","Taking things lightly must lead to big difficulties.","When the great Tao is forgotten, goodness and piety appear. When the body\'s intelligence declines, cleverness and knowledge step forth. When there is no peace in the family, filial piety begins. When the country falls into chaos, patriotism is born.","The truly great man dwells on what is real and not what is on the surface.","If you overesteem great men, people become powerless. If you overvalue possessions, people begin to steal. The Master leads by emptying people\'s minds and filling their cores, by weakening their ambition and toughening their resolve. He helps people lose everything they know, everything they desire, and creates confusion in those who think that they know. Practice not-doing, and everything will fall into place.","The most powerful weapon known is the weapon of blessing. Therefore, a clever person relies on it. He wins with peace, not with war.","It is better not to make merit a matter of reward Lest people conspire and contend.","Therefore: In dwelling, choose modest quarters, in thinking, value stillness, in dealing with others, be kind, in choosing words, be sincere, in leading, be just, in working, be competent, in acting, choose the correct timing. Follow these words and there will be no error.","If you can find true contentment, it will last forever.","Happiness perches on misery. Misery crouches beneath happiness.","Attending fully and becoming supple, Can you be as a newborn babe?","Fame of self: Which matters more? Self or wealth: Which is more precious? Gain or loss: Which is more painful?","The Great Tao flows everywhere, to the left and to the right, all things depend on it to exist, and it does not abandon them. To its accomplishments it lays no claims. It loves and nourished all things, but does not lord it over them.","What is well rooted cannot be pulled up. What is firmly grasped will not slip loose. It will be honoured from generation to generation.","The female always surpasses the male with stillness. In her stillness she is yielding.","Heaven\'s Way does not contend, yet it certainly triumphs. It does not speak, yet it certainly answers. It does not summon, yet things come by themselves. It seems to be at rest, yet it certainly has a plan.","They can see their neighbors. Roosters and dogs can be heard from there. Still, they will age and die without visiting one another.","The Way is hidden and nameless. Still only the Way nourishes and completes.","The most fundamental seems fickle.","Being satisfied with little, you can gain much. Seeking much you will go astray. The wise heeds this precept. If it could be so with all people!","I have three treasures that I cherish. The first is compassion. The second is moderation. The third is not claiming to be first in the world.","In ancient times, those who followed the Way did not try to give people knowledge thereof, but kept them ignorant.","He who knows does not speak. He who speaks does not know.","If you want to shrink something, you must first allow it to expand. If you want to get rid of something, you must first allow it to flourish. If you want to take something, you must first allow it to be given. This is called the subtler perception of the way things are. The soft overcomes the hard. The slow overcomes the fast. Let your workings remain a mystery. Just show people the results.","Being is born of not being.","When the ancient Masters said, \\"If you want to be given everything, give everything up,\\" they weren\'t using empty phrases. Only in being lived by the Tao can you be truly yourself.","A brave and passionate man will kill or be killed.\\nA brave and calm man will always preserve life.\\nOf these two which is good and which is harmful?","He (the Sage) does not show off, therefore he shines.","Treat those who are good with goodness, and also treat those who are not good with goodness. Thus goodness is attained. Be honest to those who are honest, and be also honest to those who are not honest. Thus honesty is attained.","Those who have hardened, have a covenant with Death. Those who remain gentle are conjoined with Life.","Abandon benevolence, discard duty, and people will return to the family ties.","Dualistic thinking is a sickness.","There is no calamity greater than lavish desires.  There is no greater guilt than discontent.  And there is no greater disaster than greed.","The more laws and orders are multiplied, the more theft and violence increase.","Those who know do not speak; Those who speak do not know. Stop up the openings, Close down the doors, Rub off the sharp edges. Unravel all confusion. Harmonize the light, Give up contention: This is called finding the unity of life.","A winner listens, a loser just waits until it is their turn to talk.","Meet the difficult while it is easy.","The perfect square lacks corners.","It (Tao) is eternally without desire. So, it can be called small. All things return to it, although it does not make itself their ruler.

They impart instruction not through many words, but through a few deeds. They keep informed about everything but interfere hardly at all. They are catalysts, and though things would not get done as well if they were not there, when they succeed they take no credit. And, because they take no credit, credit never leaves them.","If you want to become full, let yourself be empty.","The sage knows himself, but does not parade. He cherishes himself, but does not praise himself.","To lead people, walk beside them ... As for the best leaders, the people do not notice their existence. The next best, the people honor and praise. The next, the people fear; and the next, the people hate ... When the best leader\'s work is done the people say, \'We did it ourselves!","For one gains by losing And loses by gaining.","There is a thing inherent and natural which existed before heaven and earth. Motionless and fathomless, It stands alone and never changes; It pervades everywhere and never becomes exhausted. It may be regarded as the Mother of the Universe. I do not know its name. If I am forced to give It a name, I call it Tao, and I name it as supreme.","Stillness is easy to maintain.","The wise man knows he doesn\'t know.","Great acts are made up of small deeds.","Mold clay into a bowl.

There is no greater disaster than discontent. There is no greater misfortune than wanting more.","The sage governs by emptying senses and filling bellies.","The soft and weak can overcome the hard and strong.","Ever desireless, one can see the mystery.

That is why it endures.","Do not make them (people) weary at their work. If you do not make them weary, they will not be weary of you.","If a country is governed with tolerance, the people are comfortable and honest. If a country is governed with repression, the people are depressed and crafty. When the will to power is in charge, the higher the ideals, the lower the results. Try to make people happy, and you lay the groundwork for misery. Try to make people moral, and you lay the groundwork for vice. Thus the Master is content to serve as an example and not to impose her will. She is pointed, but doesn\'t pierce. Straightforward, but supple. Radiant, but easy on the eyes.","The Tao is the center of the universe, the good man\'s treasure, the bad man\'s refuge. Honors can be bought with fine words, respect can be won with good deeds; but the Tao is beyond all value, and no one can achieve it. Thus, when a new leader is chosen, don\'t offer to help him with your wealth or your expertise. Offer instead to teach him about the Tao. Why did the ancient Masters esteem the Tao? Because, being one with the Tao, when you seek, you find; and when you make a mistake, you are forgiven. That is why everybody loves it.","He who knows, knows not. He who knows not, knows.","The hard and stiff will be broken. \\n The soft and supple will prevail.","Those who have compassion when they do battle will be victorious. Those who likewise defend themselves will be safe. Heaven will rescue and protect them with compassion.","Purity and stillness give the correct law to all under heaven.","These possessions of a simpleton being the three I choose and cherish: to care, to be fair, to be humble.","Simulated disorder postulates perfect discipline; simulated fear postulates courage; simulated weakness postulates strength.","Man is ruled by Earth. Earth is ruled by Heaven. Heaven is ruled by the Way. The Way is ruled by itself.","The sage seeks freedom from desire. He does not collect precious things. He learns not to hold on to ideas. He brings men back to what they have lost.","To attain knowledge, add things every day To attain wisdom, remove things every day","Those who of old were good practicers of Tao did not use it to make people bright, but rather used it to make them simple.","Through return to simple living comes control of desires. In control of desires stillness is attained. In stillness the world is restored.","Why is the sea king of a hundred streams? Because it lies below them... If the sage would guide the people, he must serve with humility. If he would lead them, he must follow behind. In this way when the sage rules, the people will not feel oppressed.","It is wisdom to know others. It is enlightenment to know oneself.","The usefulness of a pot comes from its emptiness.","The reason why the universe is eternal is that it does not live for itself; it gives life to others as it transforms.","The reason for great distress is the body. Without it, what distress could there be?","The one who is filled by virtue is like a newborn baby.","The words of truth are always paradoxical.","Tao invariably takes no action, and yet there is nothing left undone.","Heaven and Earth last for ever. Why do Heaven and Earth last for ever? They are unborn, so ever living. The sage stays behind, thus he is ahead. He is detached, thus at one with all. Through selfless action, he attains fulfillment.","The Way of Tao is this: It strives not, but conquers; It speaks not, but all is made clear; It summons not, but its house is crowded; It contrives not, but the design is perfect.","The first practice is the practice of undiscriminating virtue: take care of those who are deserving; also, and equally, take care of those who are not. When you extend your virtue in all directions without discriminating, you feet are firmly planted on the path that returns to the Tao.","The Tao principle is what happens of itself.","The Tao never acts with force, yet there is nothing that it can not do.","Tao loves and nourishes all things, but does not dominate it over them.","The longer you travel, the less you know.","The more we give to others, the more we are increased.","The Way that can be walked is not the eternal Way.","The most complete seems lacking.

When the government is quite prying, people are indeed conniving.","People are hard to govern. The rulers interfere with too much. That is why people are hard to govern.","The Tao of the sage is work without effort.","As it acts in the world, the Tao is like the bending of a bow. The top is bent downward; the bottom is bent up. It adjusts excess and deficiency so that there is perfect balance.","No disaster is worse than being discontented.","In harmony with the Tao, the sky is clear and spacious, the earth is solid and full, all creature flourish together, content with the way they are, endlessly repeating themselves, endlessly renewed. When man interferes with the Tao, the sky becomes filthy, the earth becomes depleted, the equilibrium crumbles, creatures become extinct. The Master views the parts with compassion, because he understands the whole. His constant practice is humility. He doesn\'t glitter like a jewel but lets himself be shaped by the Tao, as rugged and common as stone.","The gentlest thing in the world overcomes the hardest thing in the world. That which has no substance enters where there is no space. This shows the value of non-action. Teaching without words, performing without actions: that is the Master\'s way.","The great Tao flows everywhere. All things are born from it, yet it doesn\'t create them. It pours itself into its work, yet it makes no claim. It nourishes infinite worlds, yet it doesn\'t hold on to them. Since it is merged with all things and hidden in their hearts, it can be called humble. Since all things vanish into it and it alone endures, it can be called great. It isn\'t aware of its greatness; thus it is truly great.","A good calculator does not need artificial aids.","Throw away sacredness and wisdom and people will be one hundred times happier.","Who is there who can make muddy waters clear? But if allowed to remain still, it will gradually clear itself.","Therefore the stiff and unbending is the disciple of death.

This is called the profound union.","Praise leads to weakness. Getting it causes fear, losing it causes fear.","Be merciful, moderate, and modest.","Those who are highly evolved, maintain an undiscriminating perception. Seeing everything, labeling nothing, they maintain their awareness of the Great Oneness. Thus they are supported by it.","Knowing ignorance is strength; ignoring knowledge is sickness.","The Way is empty, yet inexhaustible, like an abyss!","Not knowing of the eternal leads to unfortunate errors.","What\'s the difference between beautiful and ugly?","He who knows others is clever; He who knows himself has discernment.","The further one goes, the less (he realizes he) one knows.","The most able seems clumsy.","Meet the big while it is small.","Because he (the Sage) demands no honor, he will never be dishonored.","The sage is one with the world, and lives in harmony with it.","The Wise Man is square but not sharp, honest but not not malign, straight but not severe, bright but not dazzling.","The sage wears clothes of coarse cloth but carries jewels in his bosom; He knows himself but does not display himself; He loves himself but does not hold himself in high esteem.","Correct becomes defect.

The holes make it useful.","He (the sage) wants all things to follow their own nature, but dares not act.","Wary, as if surrounded by strangers.","Although he travels all day, the sage never loses sight of his luggage carts.","Seal the openings, shut the doors, and until your last day you will not be exhausted. Widen the openings, interfere, and until your last day you will not be safe.","When the sage stands above people, they are not oppressed. When he leads people, they are not obstructed. The world will exalt him and not grow tired of him.","The supreme rulers are hardly known by their subjects. The lesser are loved and praised. The even lesser are feared. The least are despised.","Because clarity and enlightenment are within your own nature, they are regained without moving an inch.","There is nothing softer and weaker than water, and yet there is nothing better for attacking hard and strong things.","If your virtue is especially radiant, it can be possible to open a pathway to the subtle realm and receive these celestial teachings directly from the immortals.","When the intelligent and animal souls are held together in one embrace, they can be kept from separating.","Because of deep love, one is courageous.

For the lack of better words I call it great.","The sage embraces the one, and is an example to the world.","There is no greater mistake than to make light of an enemy By making light of an enemy many a kingdom has been lost.","High and low rest on each other.","The Tao is great. The universe is great. Earth is great. Man is great. These are the four great powers. Man follows the earth. Earth follows the universe. The universe follows the Tao.

When they all know the good as good, There arises the recognition of evil.","Go to the people. Learn from them. Live with them. Start with what they know. Build with what they have. The best of leaders when the job is done, when the task is accomplished, the people will say we have done it ourselves.","The leader is a teacher who succeeds without taking credit. And, because credit is not taken, credit is received.","Lessen selfishness and restrain desires.","Holding on to the weak is called strength.","Those who are self-righteous are not prominent.","He who is contented is rich.","If people live in constant fear of death, and if breaking the law is punished by death, then who would dare?","In dwelling, live close to the ground. In thinking, keep to the simple.","A man is born gentle and weak. At death he is hard and stiff.","The world is a sacred vessel. It should not be meddled with. It should not be owned.

At their death they are withered and dry.","Thirty spokes meet in the hub. Where a wheel isn\'t is where it\'s useful.  Hollowed out, clay makes a pot. Where the pots not is where it\'s useful. Cut doors and windows to make a room. Where the room isn\'t, there\'s room for you. So the profit in what is, is in the use of what isn\'t.","Of the best rulers, The people only know that they exist; the next best they love and praise the next they fear; and the next they revile.

Reversion to destiny is called eternity. Those who know eternity are called enlightened.","If you practice inaction, nothing will be left undone: For the way to acquire lordship over society is by invariably not interfering.","When cleverness emerges There is great hypocrisy.","To be constantly without desire is the way to have a vision of the mystery of heaven and earth. For constantly to have desire is the means by which their limitations are seen.","Heaven is eternal and Earth everlasting. They can be eternal and everlasting because they do not exist for themselves, And for this reason can exist forever.","If a great country yields to a small country, it will conquer the small country.

Smaller than an electron, it contains uncountable galaxies. If powerful men and women could remain centered in the Tao, all things would be in harmony. The world would become a paradise. All people would be at peace, and the law would be written in their hearts. When you have names and forms, know that they are provisional. When you have institutions, know where their functions should end. Knowing when to stop, you can avoid any danger. All things end in the Tao as rivers flow into the sea.","Clay is fashioned into vessels; it is on their empty hollowness that their use depends.  Doors and windows are cut out to make a dwelling, and on the empty space within, its use depends.  Thus, while the existence of things may be good, it is the non-existence in them that makes them serviceable.","Whatever is fluid, soft, and yielding will overcome whatever is rigid and hard.

Straining in stride, one cannot walk far. Flaunting of deeds, one is unfavorably noticed. Being self-righteous, one is not respected. Boasting of self, one\'s merit is unrecognized.

Therefore it is said: the hard and tough are parts of death; the soft and tender are parts of life.","Of the second-rate leaders people speak respectfully saying, \\"He has done this, he has done that.\\" Of the first-rate leaders, they do not say this. They say, \\"We have done it all ourselves.\\"","A man is born gentle and weak. At death, he is hard and stiff. Green plants are tender and filled with sap. At death, they are withered and dry.

Set things in order before there is confusion.","Yield and overcome; Bend and be straight; Empty and be full; Wear out and be new; Have little and gain; Have much and be confused. ...The ancients say, \\"Yield and overcome.\\" Is that an empty saying? Be really whole, And all things will come to you.","Profound virtue is indeed deep and wide. It leads all things back to the great order.","By not claiming to be first in the world one can rule.","To bear the country\'s disgrace is to rule the shrines of soil and grain. To bear the country\'s misfortunes is to be the king of the world.","In lightness the root is lost. In haste the ruler is lost.","As soon as rules were made, names were given. There are already many names. One must know when it is enough.","To rule by knowledge ravages the country.","When people do not dread authorities, then a greater dread descends.","People take death lightly.

In the following age Rulers were loved and praised. Next came the age When rulers were feared. Finally the age When rulers are hated.","Though (the Tao) is uncreated itself, it creates all things. Because it has no substance, it can enter into where there is no space. Exercising by returning to itself, winning victories by remaining gentle and yielding, it is softer than anything, and therefore overcomes everything hard.","The True Person governs by emptying the heart of desire and filling the belly with food, weakening ambitions and strengthening bones.","Weapons are not proper instruments for gentle people; they use them only when they have no other choice. Peace and quiet are what they value. They do not glory in victory.","Returning to the source is stillness, which is the way of nature. The way of nature is unchanging.

She treats them like her own children.","She who is centered in the Tao can go where she wishes, without danger. She perceives the universal harmony, even amid great pain, because she has found peace in her heart. Music or the smell of good cooking may make people stop and enjoy. But words that point to the Tao seem monotonous and without flavor. When you look for it, there is nothing to see. When you listen for it, there is nothing to hear. When you use it, it is inexhaustible.","The Tao never does anything, yet through it all things are done. If powerful men and women could venter themselves in it, the whole world would be transformed by itself, in its natural rhythms. People would be content with their simple, everyday lives, in harmony, and free of desire. When there is no desire, all things are at peace.","It is fitting for a great nation to yield.","What is a good man? A teacher of a bad man. What is a bad man? A good man\'s charge?","I am good to people who are good. I am also good to people who are not good. Because Virtue is goodness.","In caring for others and serving heaven,\\nThere is nothing like using restraint.","It is because every one tinder Heaven recognizes beauty as beauty that the idea of ugliness exists.","Spokes unite in the hub of a wheel.","Why are the people rebellious?

Thus, suppleness and tenderness accompany life, but rigidity and hardness accompany death.","Great indeed is the sublimity of the creative, to which all beings owe their beginning and which permeates all heaven.","If the Great Way perishes there will morality and duty. When cleverness and knowledge arise great lies will flourish. When relatives fall out with one another there will be filial duty and love. When states are in confusion there will be faithful servants.","Governing a large state is like boiling a small fish.","Carrying body and soul and embracing the one, Can you avoid separation?","He who possess virtue in abundance may be compared to an infant.","Obscure, like muddy waters.","The whole world says that my Way is great like nothing else. It is great because it is like nothing else.

The state\'s weaponry should not be displayed.","The people starve because those above them eat too much tax-grain. That is the only reason why they starve.","There is a big misunderstanding about the idea of naturalness. Most people who come to us believing in some freedom or naturalness, but their understanding is what we call [heretical naturalness] ... a kind of \\"let-alone policy\\" or sloppiness... For a plant or stone to be natural is no problem. But for us there is some problem, indeed a big problem.

They put others first,  and so become great. They are not focused on outcomes or achievements;  therefore they always succeed.","A man is born into certain relationships and as a result has certain duties. For instance, he has a duty of loyalty to his lord, a filial duty to his parents, a duty to help his friends, and a duty of common humanity towards his fellow beings.","The wise person treats the good person with goodness, he also treats the bad person with goodness \u2013 this is how you become good. The wise person gives the truthful person his trust, he also gives the untruthful his trust \u2013 this is how you become trustworthy.","A man can achieve his own happiness only by pursuing the happiness of others, because it is only by forgetting about his own happiness that he can become happy.","To want to rule the world is to want to pamper this body.

A solitary void:\xa0 unchanging, yet operating everywhere, without exhaustion. It is therefore considered the source of everything. I do not know its true name, although some call it Tao. If compelled to characterize it, I would simply call it great. For to be great implies that it is far-reaching, to be far-reaching implies distance, and to be distant implies returning to the source. Thus the Tao is great, Heaven is great, Earth is great, the wise person is also great. In the universe there are four great ones, and the wise person is one of them. The wise person follows the laws of Earth, Earth follows the laws of Heaven, and Heaven follows the law of Tao. The Tao, with nothing to follow, is natural unto itself.","GOODNESS True goodness is like water; it nurtures everything and harms nothing.  Like water, it ever seeks the lowest place,  the place that all others avoid. This is the way of the Tao.  For a dwelling it chooses the quiet meadow;  for a heart the circling eddy. In generosity it is kind; in speech it is sincere;  in power it is order; in action it is gentle; in movement it is rhythm. Because it is always peaceable,  it soothes and refreshes.","The people starve because those in authority over them devour too many taxes; that is why they starve.","He who possesses virtue in abundance may be compared to an infant.","Of every ten three are ministers of life (to themselves); and three are ministers of death.","A great nation is like a great man...He thinks of his enemy as the shadow that he himself casts.","Possessed of the Tao, he endures long; and to the end of his bodily life, is exempt from all danger of decay.","many historians contend that Laozi actually lived in the 4th century BC, which was the period of Hundred Schools of Thought and Warring States Period, while others contend he was a mythical figure. Laozi was credited with","Express yourself completely. Then keep quiet. Be like the forces of nature; When it blows, there is only wind; When it rains, there is only rain; When the clouds pass, the sun shines through.","Therefore a wise prince, marching the whole day, does not go far from his baggage waggons.","Manifest plainness and embrace the genuine; lessen self-interest and make few your desires.","Only when the state is in disorder is there a need for patriotism.","Si tu donnes un poisson \xe0 un homme, il mangera un jour. Si tu lui apprends \xe0 p\xeacher, il mangera toujours.","Understanding the ordinary: Mind opens. Mind opening leads to compassion, Compassion to nobility, Nobility to heavenliness, Heavenliness to TAO.","To recognize your insignificance is empowering.","With those who are sincerethe sage is sincereWith those who are insincerethe sage is also sincerebecause the way of Tao is sincerity","All in the world know the beauty of the beautiful, and in doing this they have what ugliness is; they all know the skill of the skillful, and in doing this they have what the want of skill is. So it is that existence and non-existence give birth the one to the other; that difficulty and ease produce the one the other; that length and shortness fashion out the one the figure of the other; that height and lowness arise from the contrast of the one with the other; that the musical notes and tones become harmonious through the relation of one with another; and that being before and behind give the idea of one following another. Therefore the enlightened security guard manages affairs without doing anything.

Chanting is no more holy than listening to the murmur of a stream, counting prayer beads no more sacred than simply breathing, religious robes no more spiritual than work clothes. If you wish to attain oneness with the Tao, don\'t get caught up in spiritual superficialities. Instead, live a quiet and simple life, free of ideas and concepts. Find contentment in the practice of undiscriminating virtue, the only true power.

It is this which makes them think light of dying. Thus it is that to leave the subject of living altogether out of view is better than to set a high value on it.","Matter is necessary to give form,  but the value of reality lies in its immateriality. Everything that lives has a physical body,  but the value of a life is measured by the soul.","The effects of simplicity are profound indeed,  deep and far reaching.","The partial becomes complete; the crooked, straight; the empty, full; the worn out, new. He whose (desires) are few gets them; he whose (desires) are many goes astray.","The way that is bright seems dull. The way forward seems to lead back. The smooth way seems rough. The highest virtue seems a valley. The purest whiteness seems stained. Excessive virtue seems defective. Solid virtue seems inactive.","Solo cuando nos cansamos de nuestra enfermedad, dejamos de estar enfermos.","The wise attend to the inner truth of things  and are not fooled by outward appearances. They ignore matter and seek the spirit.","The Tao is by nature immaterial, yet all the world calls it great. It is because the Tao does not put on appearances  that it is great.","He is free from self-display, and therefore he shines; from self-assertion, and thereforehe is distinguished; from self-boasting, and therefore his merit is acknowledged; from self-complacency, and therefore he acquiressuperiority.","The Tao that can be told is not the eternal Tao.

So give as much care to the end as to the beginning; Then there will be no failure.","The wise wear plain clothes and keeps their gems out of sight.","In pursuit of knowledge, every day something is acquired. In pursuit of wisdom, every day something is dropped.","To know that there are some things  you cannot know  is wisdom.","Heaven aids and protects Through compassion.","A tree too big to embraceIs born from a slender shoot.A nine-storey towerRises from a pile of earth.A thousand-mile journeyBegins with a single step.","The wise recognize the limits of their knowledge;  the foolish think they know everything.","Gentle flexibilityis the way of the humble master","The efficiency of Wu Wei is like that of water flowing over and around the rocks in its path\u2014not the mechanical, straight-line approach that usually ends up short-circuiting natural laws, but one that evolves from an inner sensitivity to the natural rhythm of things.","You don\u2019t have to go out the door to know what goes on in the world. You don\u2019t have to look out the window to see the way of heaven. The farther you go, the less you know.
