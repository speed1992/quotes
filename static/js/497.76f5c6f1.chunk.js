For those who realize this, quarrels end.","What we are today comes from our thoughts of yesterday, and our present thoughts build our life of tomorrow: our life is the creation of our mind. If a man speaks or acts with an impure mind, suffering will follow him as the wheel of the cart follows the beast that draws the cart. If a man speaks or acts with a pure mind, joy follows him as his own shadow.","Endurance is one of the most difficult disciplines but it is to the one who endures that the final victory comes.","Dependent Origination is the teaching (that life) is not the mere play of blind chance, but has an existence that is dependent upon conditions. That, precisely with the removal of these conditions, those things that have arisen in dependence upon them-thus also all suffering-must perforce disappear and cease to be.","Goodwill toward all beings is the true religion; cherish in your hearts boundless goodwill to all that lives.","When a man is stimulated by his own thoughts, full of desire and dwelling on what is attractive, his craving increases even more. He is making the fetter even stronger. But he who takes pleasure in stilling his thoughts, practising the contemplation of what is repulsive, and remaining recollected, now he will make an end of craving, he will snap the bonds of Mara. His aim is accomplished, he is without fear, rid of craving and without stain. He has removed the arrows of changing existence. This is his last body.","A tree is a wonderful living organism which gives shelter, food, warmth and protection to all living things. It even gives shade to those who wield an axe to cut it down","Your enemy can be your greatest teacher.","Truths cannot be acquired from words out of other people\'s mouths. Before Truths can be internalized, they must come from one\'s own realizations and practices. Through a lifetime of personal practice, human beings are capable of revealing all of the secrets of the cosmic essence. You are your own best judge.","In every trial Let understanding fight for you.","Wherever you live is your temple, if you treat it like one.","Surely if living creatures saw the results of all their evil deeds, they would turn away from them in disgust. But selfhood blinds them, and they cling to their obnoxious desires. They crave pleasure for themselves and they cause pain to others; when death destroys their individuality, they find no peace; their thirst for existence abides and their selfhood reappears in new births. Thus they continue to move in the coil and can find no escape from the hell of their own making.","Love is a fleeting emotion, to reach true nirvana one must know themselves and forsake love, for it breeds contempt","When you come upon a path\\n that brings benefit \\n and happiness to all,\\n follow this course\\n as the moon\\n journeys through the stars.","More than those who hate you, more than all your enemies, an undisciplined mind does greater harm.","We are formed and molded by our thoughts. Those whose minds are shaped by selfless thoughts give joy when they speak or act.","Peace comes from within. Do not seek it without. It can be argued that peace and happiness comes from the subjective internalised perspective of realizing things could be worse and being grateful they aren\'t. The alternative view that peace and happiness comes from the objective external perspective of having more and better things than at present, while important for growth, can be a never-ending source of jealousy, dissatisfaction and disappointment. A balance of the two, where people are grateful for what they have while striving for more seems the best blended perspective.","Life is dear to all beings, they have the right to live the same that we do.","The mind contains all possibilities.","The judgment: You are now before Yama, King of the Dead. In vain will you try to...deny or conceal the evil deeds you have done. ... the mirror in which Yama seems to read your past is your own memory, and also his judgment is your own. It is you yourself who pronounce your own judgment.","Drop by drop is the water pot filled. Likewise, the wise man, gathering it little by little, fills himself with good.","Remember that the only constant in life is change.","As a net is made up of a series of ties, so everything in this world is connected by a series of ties. If anyone thinks that the mesh of a net is an independent, isolated thing, he is mistaken. It is called a net because it is made up of a series of interconnected meshes, and each mesh has its place and responsibility in relation to other meshes.","If we fail to look after others when they need help, who will look after us?","Pity arises when we are sorry for someone.Compassion is when we understand and help wisely.","Through our senses the world appears. Through our reactions we create delusions.Without reactions the world becomes clear.","Karma grows from our hearts. Karma terminates from our hearts.","To utter pleasant words without practicing them, is like a fine flower without fragrance.","Your days pass like rainbows, like a flash of lightning, like a star at dawn. Your life is short. How can you quarrel?","Believe only what you yourself test and judge to be true.","Why cling to the pain and the wrongs of yesterday?  Why hold on to the very things that keep you from hope and love.","You should respect each other and refrain from disputes; you should not, like water and oil, repel each other, but should, like milk and water, mingle together.","\\"Existence is sorrow.\\" Understand, and go beyond sorrow. This is the way of brightness.","The secret of health for both mind and body is...live the present moment wisely and earnestly.","Harm no other beings.

Putting oneself in the place of another, one should not kill nor cause another to kill.","The world is afflicted by death and decay. But the wise do not grieve, having realized the nature of the world.","The Tempter masters the lazy and irresolute man who dwells on the attractive side of things, ungoverned in his senses, and unrestrained in his food, like the wind overcomes a rotten tree. But the Tempter cannot master a man who dwells on the distasteful side of things, self-controlled in his senses, moderate in eating, resolute and full of faith, like the wind cannot move a mountain crag.","The heavens and the earth may be captured by the mind\'s eye.","Speak or act with a pure mind, and happiness will follow you as your shadow, unshakable.","The greatest action is not conforming with the worlds ways.","Learn to ne happy with what you have.","The one who wanders independent in the world, free from opinions and viewpoints, does not grasp them and enter into disputations and arguments. As the lotus rises on its stalk unsoiled by the mud and the water, so the wise one speaks of peace and is unstained by the opinions of the world.","Have compassion for all beings, rich and poor alike; each has their suffering. Some suffer too much, others too little.","Friendship is the only cure for hatred, the only guarantee of peace.","If it is not truthful and not helpful, don\'t say it. If it is truthful and not helpful, don\'t say it. If it is not truthful and helpful, don\'t say it. If it is truthful and helpful, wait for the right time.","It is impossible to underestimate the significance of your today\'s choices","Whatever a person frequently thinks and reflects on, that will become the inclination of their mind.","Do not let pleasure distract you from meditation, from the way.

The thoughtful do not die: the thoughtless are as if dead already.","To meditate is to listen with a receptive heart.","Giving the best to others are giving the best to us. The value of life is not based on how long we live. But, how much can we contribute to others in our society ?","The mind that perceives the limitation is the limitation.","This is the entire spiritual life, Ananda, that is, good friendship, good companionship, good comradeship. When a monk has a good friend, a good companion, a good comrade, it is to be expected that he will develop and cultivate the Noble Eightfold Path.","To share happiness, and to have done something good before leaving this life is sweet.","All beings tremble before violence. All love life. All fear death. See yourself in others. Then whom can you hurt? What harm can you do?","Better than a thousand hollow words Is one word that brings peace. Better than a thousand hollow verses Is one verse that brings peace.","When one sees that everything exists as an illusion, one can live in a higher sphere than ordinary man.","We are the same as plants, as trees, as other people, as the rain that falls. We consist of that which is around us, we are the same as everything.","There is a way to be purified, to overcome sorrows and grief, to release suffering, to secure the right path to realize nirvana. This is to be mindful.","Religion is a cow. It gives milk, but it also kicks.","It is the fool who is haunted by fears, dread of dangers, oppression of mind, not the wise man.","I teach one thing and one only: that is, suffering and the end of suffering.","If you truly loved yourself, you could never hurt another.","Anger will never disappear so long as thoughts of resentment are cherished in the mind.","It is a man\'s own mind, not his enemy or foe, that lures him to evil ways.","And he who has considered all the contrasts on this earth, and is no more disturbed by anything whatever in the world, the Peaceful One, freed from rage, from sorrow, and from longing, he has passed beyond birth and decay.","From the passions arise worry, and from worry arises fear. Away with the passions, and no fear, no worry.","Just as the great ocean has one taste, the taste of salt, so also this teaching and discipline has one taste, the taste of liberation.","His success may be great, but be it ever so great the wheel of fortune may turn again and bring him down into the dust.","May I hold myself in compassion.\\nMay I meet the suffering and ignorance of others with compassion.","Men are tied up to their families and possessions more helplessly than in a prison. There is an occasion for the prisoner to be released, but householders entertain no desire to be relieved from the ties of family. When a man\'s passion is aroused nothing prevents him from ruining himself. Even into the jaws of a tiger will he jump. Those who are thus drowned in the filth of passion are called the ignorant. Those who are able to overcome it are saintly Arhats.","To stop suffering, stop greediness. Greediness is a source of suffering.","The wise say that it is not an iron, wooden or fiber fetter which is a strong one, but the besotted hankering after trinkets, children and wives, that, say the wise, is the strong fetter. It drags one down, and loose as it feels, it is hard to break. Breaking this fetter, people renounce the world, free from longing and abandoning sensuality.","This is how to contemplate our conditioned existence in this fleeting world: \\n \\n Like a tiny drop of dew, or a bubble floating in a stream; \\n Like a flash of lightning in a summer cloud, \\n Or a flickering lamp, an illusion, a phantom, or a dream. \\n \\n So is all conditioned existence to be seen.","How does one stay mindful? Where feelings are known as they arise, known as they persist, known as they pass away. Thoughts are known as they arise, known as they persist, known as they pass away.

In this way you will be aware of and control wrong desires.","When you go into the space of nothingness, everything becomes known.","To be selfish, greedy and unwilling to help the needy gives rise to future starvation and clothlessness.","A generous heart, kind speech, & a life of service & compassion are the things which renew humanity.","Better is to speak unpleasant truth than to tell lies.","If a traveller does not meet with one who is his better, or his equal, let him firmly keep to his solitary journey; there is no companionship with a fool.","Radiate boundless love towards the entire world - above, below, and across - unhindered, without ill will, without enmity.","The fool is his own enemy.

If people expect only happiness in life, they will be disappointed.","You too shall pass away. Knowing this, how can you quarrel?","No matter what path you choose, really walk it.","It is good to have companions when occasion arises, and it is good to be contented with whatever comes.","Just as treasures are uncovered from the earth, so virtue appears from good deeds, and wisdom appears from a pure and peaceful mind. To walk safely through the maze of human life, one needs the light of wisdom and the guidance of virtue.","Kindnessis giving others happiness.Compassionis removing others\' bitterness.Joyis freeing others from suffering.","Winning gives birth to hostility Losing, one lies down in pain. The calmed lie down with ease, having set winning and losing aside.","Consider Others as Yourself.","Concentrate the mind on the present moment.","Moved by their selfish desires, people seek after fame and glory. But when they have acquired it, they are already stricken in years. If you hanker after worldly fame and practise not the Way, your labors are wrongfully applied and your energy is wasted. It is like unto burning an incense stick. However much its pleasing odor be admired, the fire that consumes is steadily burning up the stick.","Suffering does not befall him who is without attachment to names and forms.","See the truth, and you will see me.","If a man who has committed many a misdemeanor does not repent and cleanse his heart of the evil, retribution will come upon his person as sure as the streams run into the ocean which becomes ever deeper and wider. If a man who has committed a misdemeanor come to the knowledge of it, reform himself, and practise goodness, the force of retribution will gradually exhaust itself as a disease gradually loses its baneful influence when the patient perspires.","What is evil? Killing is evil, lying is evil, slandering is evil, abuse is evil, gossip is evil, envy is evil, hatred is evil, to cling to false doctrine is evil; all these things are evil. And what is the root of evil? Desire is the root of evil, illusion is the root of evil.","To force oneself to believe and to accept a thing without understanding is political, and not spiritual or intellectual.","Beware of the anger of the mouth. Master your words. Let them serve truth.","Will not be punished for your anger, your anger is the punishment.","If you hold yourself dear, protect yourself well.","If we can look upon our work not for self-benefit,but as a means to benefit society,we will be practicing appreciation and patience in our daily lives.","A family is a place where minds come in contact with one another. If these minds love one another the home will be as beautiful as a flower garden.

If you speak and act with a polluted mind, suffering will follow you, as the wheels of the oxcart follow the footsteps of the ox. Everything is based on mind, is led by mind, is fashioned by mind. If you speak and act with a pure mind, happiness will follow you, as a shadow clings to a form.","By giving away food we get more strength. By bestowing clothing on others we gain more beauty. By donating abodes of purity and truth we acquire great treasures.","I reached in experience the nirvana which is unborn, unrivalled, secure from attachment, undecaying and unstained. This condition is indeed reached by me which is deep, difficult to see, difficult to understand, tranquil, excellent, beyond the reach of mere logic, subtle, and to be realized only by the wise.","Nothing is to be clung to as I, me or mine","If a man\'s mind becomes pure, his surroundings will also become pure.","People cleave to their worldly possessions and selfish passions so blindly as to sacrifice their own lives for them.

A useless log of wood, it lies on the ground, Then what does it know? Your worst enemy cannot harm you As much as your own thoughts, unguarded.

My mind is free from active thought, and has made an end of craving.","Dispassion is the best of mental states. . . .","If a man lives a pure life, nothing can destroy him.","The world is full of suffering. Birth is suffering, decre- pitude is suffering, sickness and death are sufferings.

In fact, life that is not free from desire and passion is always involved with suffering.","Do not say anything harsh: what you have said will be said back to you.","A person writing at night may put out the lamp, but the words he has written will remain.

Steadfast is his mind, gained is deliverance.","Even death is not to be feared by one who has lived wisely.","Through effort you will cross any raging flood, through energy you will pass any sorrow.","All compounded things are subject to decay. Strive with diligence!","Should a person do good, let him do it again and again. Let him find pleasure therein, for blissful is the accumulation of good.","Don\'t keep searching for the truth, just let go of your opinions.","Unity can only be manifested by the Binary. Unity itself and the idea of Unity are already two.","Let us live most happily, free from hatred in the midst of the hateful; Let us remain free from hatred in the midst of people who hate.","Better than a long speech is a single quietening word.","One who previously made bad karma, but who reforms and creates good karma, brightens the world like the moon appearing from behind a cloud.","If you are tossed about by doubts, full of strong thoughtless passions, and yearning only for that which is detrimental, your thirst will grow stronger and stronger, unquenched, and your pain will grow with your defilements.","Like a lovely flower full of color but lacking in fragrance, are the words of those who do not practice what they teach.","I am always at the beginning.","Even loss and betrayal can bring us awakening.","This existence of ours is as transient as autumn clouds To watch the birth and death of beings is like looking at the movements of a dance. A lifetime is like a flash of lightning in the sky, Rushing by, like a torrent down a steep mountain.","It is better to do nothing Than to do what is wrong. For whatever you do, you do to yourself.","From craving arises sorrow, from craving arises fear, but he who is freed from craving has no sorrow and certainly no fear.","The gift of Truthovercomes all gifts.The joy of Truthovercomes all pleasures.The taste of Truthovercomes all sweetness.","Water surrounds the lotus flower, but does not wet its petals.","If you don\'t disturb yourself, like a broken gong does not vibrate, then you have achieved nirvana.

Serene, you look upon the lost like one that stands on a mountain sees those that stand upon the plain.","Neither my life of luxury in the palace -nor- my life as ascetic in the forest were ways to enlightenment.","Let all-embracing thoughts for all beings be yours.","A kind man who makes good use of wealth is rightly said to possess a great treasure; but the miser who hoards up his riches will have no profit.","Whatsoever misfortunes there are Here in this world or in the next, They all have their root in Ignorance And in the accumulation of Longing and Desire.","The ignorant man is an ox. He grows in size, not in wisdom.","When giving to others do not linger on thoughts of a giving, what was given, or the one who has received.","For, owners of their deeds (karma) are the beings, heirs of their deeds; their deeds are the womb from which they sprang; with their deeds they are bound up; their deeds are their refuge.
