Foolishness is a great deal more vital and healthy than our straining and striving after a meaningful life.","Knowledge is of no value unless you put it into practice.","Everything on earth is beautiful, everything -- except what we ourselves think and do when we forget the higher purposes of life and our own human dignity.","Don\'t tell me the moon is shining; show me the glint of light on broken glass.","Any idiot can face a crisis - it\'s day to day living that wears you out.","There is nothing more awful, insulting, and depressing than banality.","The task of a writer is not to solve the problem but to state the problem correctly.","A good upbringing means not that you won\'t spill sauce on the tablecloth, but that you won\'t notice it when someone else does.","You will not become a saint through other people\'s sins.","What a fine weather today! Can\u2019t choose whether to drink tea or to hang myself.","When a person is born, he can embark on only one of three roads of life: if you go right, the wolves will eat you; if you go left, you\u2019ll eat the wolves; if you go straight, you\u2019ll eat yourself.","If you want to work on your art, work on your life.","The illusion which exalts us is dearer to us than ten thousand truths.","Doctors are just the same as lawyers; the only difference is that lawyers merely rob you, whereas doctors rob you and kill you too.","Life is given only once, and one wants to live it boldly, with full conscious and beauty.","All saints have past and all sinners have a future.","The snow has not yet left the earth but spring is already asking to enter your heart.","Life on earth is inconceivable without trees.","Art, especially the stage, is an area where it is impossible to walk without stumbling. There are in store for you many unsuccessful days and whole unsuccessful seasons: there will be great misunderstandings and deep disappointments\u2026 you must be prepared for all this, expect it and nevertheless, stubbornly, fanatically follow your own way.","People don\'t notice whether it\'s winter or summer when they\'re happy.","I think human beings must have faith or must look for faith, otherwise our life is empty, empty. To live and not to know why the cranes fly, why children are born, why there are stars in the sky. You must know why you are alive, or else everything is nonsense, just blowing in the wind.","You must trust and believe in people or life becomes impossible.","My love is like a stone tied round my neck; it\'s dragging me down to the bottom; but I love my stone. I can\'t live without it.","Perhaps the feelings that we experience when we are in love represent a normal state. Being in love shows a person who he should be.","We are accustomed to live in hopes of good weather, a good harvest, a nice love-affair, hopes of becoming rich or getting the office of chief of police, but I\'ve never noticed anyone hoping to get wiser. We say to ourselves: it\'ll be better under a new tsar, and in two hundred years it\'ll still be better, and nobody tries to make this good time come tomorrow. On the whole, life gets more and more complex every day and moves on its own sweet will, and people get more and more stupid, and get isolated from life in ever-increasing numbers.","People\'s destinies are so different. Some people drag along, unnoticed and boring\u2014they\'re all alike, and they\'re all unhappy. Then there are others, like for instance you\u2014you\'re one in a million. You\'re happy\u2014","If I wanted to order a ring for myself, the inscription I should choose would be: \\"Nothing passes away.\\" I believe that nothing passes away without leaving a trace, and that every step we take, however small, has significance for our present and our future existence.","Better a debauched canary than a pious wolf.","Try to reason about love, and you will lose your reason.","Man has been endowed with reason, with the power to create, so that he can add to what he\'s been given. But up to now he hasn\'t been a creator, only a destroyer. Forests keep disappearing, rivers dry up, wild life\'s become extinct, the climate\'s ruined and the land grows poorer and uglier every day.","Only entropy comes easy.","It\'s easier to ask for money from the poor than from the wealthy.","There are still many more days of failure ahead, whole seasons of failure, things will go terribly wrong, you will have huge disappointments , but you have to prepare for that, you have to expect it and be resolute and follow your own path.","The secret of boring people lies in telling them everything.","Why are we worn out? Why do we, who start out so passionate, brave, noble, believing, become totally bankrupt by the age of thirty or thirty-five? Why is it that one is extinguished by consumption, another puts a bullet in his head, a third seeks oblivion in vodka, cards, a fourth, in order to stifle fear and anguish, cynically tramples underfoot the portrait of his pure, beautiful youth? Why is it that, once fallen, we do not try to rise, and, having lost one thing, we do not seek another? Why?","We learn about life not from plusses alone, but from minuses as well.","A man and a woman marry because both of them do not know what to do with themselves.","It is time for writers to admit that nothing in this world makes sense. Only fools and charlatans think they know and understand everything. The stupider they are, the wider they conceive their horizons to be. And if an artist decides to declare that he understands nothing of what he sees - this in itself constitutes a considerable clarity in the realm of thought, and a great step forward.","Everything should be first-rate in a person, his face, clothes, soul and thoughts.","I have the feeling that I\'ve seen everything, but failed to notice the elephants.","Just as I shall lie alone in the grave, so, in essence, do I live alone.","Let us learn to appreciate there will be times when the trees will be bare, and look forward to the time when we may pick the fruit.","If our life has a meaning, an aim, it has nothing to do with our personal happiness, but something wiser and greater.","Nothing can be accomplished by logic and ethics.","If I had listened to the critics I\'d have died drunk in the gutter","For God\'s sake, have some self-respect and do not run off at the mouth if your brain is out to lunch.","If in the first act you introduce a gun, by the third act you have to use it.","Be sure not to discuss your hero\'s state of mind. Make it clear from his actions.","[Six principles that make for a good story:] 1. Absence of lengthy verbiage of a political-social-economic nature; 2. total objectivity; 3. truthful descriptions of persons and objects; 4. extreme brevity; 5. audacity and originality: flee the stereotype; 6. compassion.","I expect I shall be a student to the end of my days.","Wisdom.... comes not from age, but from education and learning.","Medicine is my lawful wife and literature my mistress; when I get tired of one, I spend the night with the other.","This life of ours...human life is like a flower gloriously blooming in a meadow: along comes a goat, eats it up---no more flower.","The role of the artist is to ask questions, not answer them.","Better to perish from fools than to accept praises from them.","The more refined one is, the more unhappy.","In nature a repulsive caterpillar turns into a lovely butterfly. But with human beings it is the other way round: a lovely butterfly turns into a repulsive caterpillar.","When a person expends the least amount of motion on one action, that is grace.","It\'s not a matter of old or new forms; a person writes without thinking about any forms, he writes because it flows freely from his soul.","Even while lying, you\'ll be believed if you speak with authority.","Man will become better when you show him what he is like.","It is easy to be a philosopher in academia, but it is very difficult to be a philosopher in life.","The more cultured a man, the less fortunate he is.","A woman can become a man\'s friend only in the following stages - first an acquantaince, next a mistress, and only then a friend.","When asked, \\"Why do you always wear black?\\", he said, \\"I am mourning for my life.","An artist observes, selects, guesses, and synthesizes.","We shall find peace. We shall hear angels, we shall see the sky sparkling with diamonds.","Cross out as many adjectives and adverbs as you can. ... It is comprehensible when I write: \\"The man sat on the grass,\\" because it is clear and does not detain one\'s attention. On the other hand, it is difficult to figure out and hard on the brain if I write: \\"The tall, narrow-chested man of medium height and with a red beard sat down on the green grass that had already been trampled down by the pedestrians, sat down silently, looking around timidly and fearfully.\\" The brain can\'t grasp all that at once, and art must be grasped at once, instantaneously.","In displaying the psychology of your characters, minute particulars are essential. God save us from vague generalizations! Be sure not to discuss your hero\'s state of mind. Make it clear from his actions. Nor is it necessary to portray many main characters. Let two people be the center of gravity in your story: he and she.","You ask me what life is. That\'s like asking what a carrot is. A carrot is a carrot, and there\'s nothing more to know.","An actress without talent, forty years old, ate a partridge for dinner, and I felt sorry for the partridge, for it occurred to me that in its life it had been more talented, more sensible, and more honest than the actress.","My mother and father are the only people on the whole planet for whom I will never begrudge a thing. Should I achieve great things, it is the work of their hands; they are splendid people and their absolute love of their children places them above the highest praise. It cloaks all of their shortcomings, shortcomings that may have resulted from a difficult life.","Time will pass, and we shall go away for ever, and we shall be forgotten, our faces will be forgotten, our voices, and how many there were of us; but our sufferings will pass into joy for those who will live after us, happiness and peace will be established upon earth, and they will remember kindly and bless those who have lived before.","When describing nature, a writer should seize upon small details, arranging them so that the reader will see an image in his mind after he closes his eyes. For instance: you will capture the truth of a moonlit night if you\'ll write that a gleam like starlight shone from the pieces of a broken bottle, and then the dark, plump shadow of a dog or wolf appeared. You will bring life to nature only if you don\'t shrink from similes that liken its activities to those of humankind.","The teacher must be an actor, an artist,passionately in love with his work.","Common hypocrites pass themselves off as doves; political and literary hypocrites pose as eagles. But don\'t be fooled by their eagle-like appearance. These are not eagles, but rats or dogs.","Without a knowledge of languages you feel as if you don\'t have a passport.","There should be more sincerity and heart in human relations, more silence and simplicity in our interactions. Be rude when you\'re angry, laugh when something is funny, and answer when you\'re asked.","You confuse two things: solving a problem and stating a problem correctly. It is only the second that is obligatory for an artist.","Lying is the same as alcoholism. Liars prevaricate even on their deathbeds.","The problem is that we attempt to solve the simplest questions cleverly, thereby rendering them unusually complex. One should seekthe simple solution.","It\'s very hard, feeling that you\'re no more than a piece of unwanted furniture in this world.","What a delight it is to respect people!","When all is said and done, no literature can outdo the cynicism of real life; you won\'t intoxicate with one glass someone who has already drunk up a whole barrel.","There are plenty of good people, but only a very, very few are precise and disciplined.","The government is not God. It does not have the right to take away that which it can\'t return even if it wants to.","He who desires nothing, hopes for nothing, and is afraid of nothing, cannot be an artist.","Every person lives his real, most interesting life under the cover of secrecy.","In all the universe nothing remains permanent and unchanged but the spirit.","If you ever have need of my life, come and take it.","Three o\'clock in the morning. The soft April night is looking at my windows and caressingly winking at me with its stars. I can\'t sleep, I am so happy.","Only one who loves can remember so well.","He is an emancipated thinker who is not afraid to write foolish things.","The aim of fiction is absolute and honest truth.","Everyone has the same God; only people differ.","If an intelligent, educated, and healthy man begins to complain of his lot and go down-hill, there is nothing for him to do but to go on down until he reaches the bottom--there is no hope for him. Where could my salvation come from? How can I save myself? I cannot drink, because it makes my head ache. I never could write bad poetry. I cannot pray for strength and see anything lofty in the languor of my soul. Laziness is laziness and weakness weakness. I can find no other names for them. I am lost, I am lost; there is no doubt of that.","The unhappy are egotistical, base, unjust, cruel, and even less capable of understanding one another than are idiots. Unhappinessdoes not unite people, but separates them.","My own experience is that once a story has been written, one has to cross out the beginning and the end. It is there that we authors do most of our lying.","The happy man only feels at ease because the unhappy bear their burden in silence. Without this silence, happiness would be impossible.","There is nothing more vulgar than a petty bourgeois life with its halfpence, its victuals, its futile talk, and its useless conventional virtue.","I have no faith in our hypocritical, false, hysterical, uneducated and lazy intelligentsia when they suffer and complain: their oppression comes from within. I believe in individual people. I see salvation in discrete individuals, intellectuals and peasants, strewn hither and yon throughout Russia. They have the strength, although there are few of them.","The world perishes not from bandits and fires, but from hatred, hostility, and all these petty squabbles.","I don\u2019t understand anything about the ballet; all I know is that during the intervals the ballerinas stink like horses.","Write only of what is important and eternal.","If you are afraid of loneliness, do not marry.","Calculating selfishness is the annihilation of self.","I kept thinking how marvellous it would be if I could somehow tear my heart, which felt so heavy, out of my chest.","Oh, I have now a mania for shortness. Whatever I read - my own or other people\'s works - it all seems to me not short enough.","If you wish women to love you be original; I know a man who used to wear felt boots summer and winter & women fell in love with him.","If there\'s any illness for which people offer many remedies, you may be sure that particular illness is incurable, I think.","I observed that after marriage people cease to be curious.","Each of us is full of too many wheels, screws and valves to permit us to judge one another on a first impression or by two or three external signs.","In a century or two, or in a millennium, people will live in a new way, a happier way. We won\\"t be there to see it - but it\\"s why we live, why we work. It\\"s why we suffer. We\\"re creating it. That\\"s the purpose of our existence. The only happiness we can know is to work toward that goal.","My holy of holies is the human body, health, intelligence, talent, inspiration, love, and absolute freedom--freedom from violence and falsehood, no matter how the last two manifest themselves.","To regard one\'s immortality as an exchange of matter is as strange as predicting the future of a violin case once the expensive violin it held has broken and lost its worth.","In short stories it is better to say not enough than to say too much, because, because--I don\'t know why.","There is something beautiful, touching and poetic when one person loves more than the other, and the other is indifferent.","Man is what he believes.","The world is, of course, nothing but our conception of it.","Formerly, when I would feel a desire to understand someone, or myself, I would take into consideration not actions, in which everything is relative, but wishes. Tell me what you want and I\'ll tell you who you are.","Try to be original in your play and as clever as possible; but don\'t be afraid to show yourself foolish; we must have freedom of thinking, and only he is an emancipated thinker who is not afraid to write foolish things.","I can only regard with bewilderment an educated man who is also religious","My own experience is that once a story has been written, one has to cross out the beginning and the end. It is there that we authors do most of our lying . . . one must ruthlessly suppress everything that is not concerned with the subject. If, in the first chapter, you say there is a gun hanging on the wall, you should make quite sure that it is going to be used further on in the story.","All I wanted was to say honestly to people: \'Have a look at yourselves and see how bad and dreary your lives are!\' The important thing is that people should realize that, for when they do, they will most certainly create another and better life for themselves. I will not live to see it, but I know that it will be quite different, quite unlike our present life. And so long as this different life does not exist, I shall go on saying to people again and again: \'Please, understand that your life is bad and dreary!\'","Exquisite nature, daydreams, and music say one thing, real life another.","In order to cultivate yourself and to drop no lower than the level of the milieu in which you have landed, it is not enough to read Pickwick and memorize a monologue from Faust... You need to work continually day and night, to read ceaselessly, to study, to exercise your will... Each hour is precious.","Faith is an aptitude of the spirit. It is, in fact, a talent: you must be born with it.","To judge between good or bad, between successful and unsuccessful would take the eye of a God.","Write, write, write-till your fingers break.","Women can\'t forgive failure.","Love, respect, and friendship do unite a people as well as a common hatred does.","Money, like vodka, turns a person into an eccentric.","You have lost your reason and taken the wrong path. You have taken lies for truth, and hideousness for beauty. You would marvel if, owing to strange events of some sorts, frogs and lizards suddenly grew on apple and orange trees instead of fruit, or if roses began to smell like a sweating horse; so I marvel at you who exchange heaven for earth. I don\'t want to understand you.","What seems to us serious, significant and important will, in future times, be forgotten or won\'t seem important at all.","People are far more sincere and good-humored at speeding their parting guests than on meeting them.","The bourgeoisie is very fond of so-called practical types and novels with happy endings, since they soothe it with the idea that one can both accumulate capital and preserve innocence, be a beast and at the same time be happy...","After us they\'ll fly in hot air balloons, coat styles will change, perhaps they\'ll discover a sixth sense and cultivate it, but life will remain the same, a hard life full of secrets, but happy. And a thousand years from now man will still be sighing, \\"Oh! Life is so hard!\\" and will still, like now, be afraid of death and not want to die.","Not one of our mortal gauges is suitable for evaluating non-existence, for making judgments about that which is not a person.","Do you see that tree? It is dead but it still sways in the wind with the others. I think it would be like that with me. That if I died I would still be part of life in one way or another.","A good person will feel guilty even before a dog.","They say philosophers and wise men are indifferent. Wrong. Indifference is a paralysis of the soul, a premature death.","[In] death at least there would be one profit; it would no longer be necessary to eat, to drink, to pay taxes, or to [offend] others; and as a man lies in his grave not one year, but hundreds and thousands of years, the profit was enormous. The life of man was, in short, a loss, and only his death a profit.","The unhappy are egoistic, spiteful, unjust, cruel, and less capable of understanding each other than fools. Unhappiness does not bring people together but draws them apart, and even where one would fancy people should be united by the similarity of their sorrow, far more injustice and cruelty is generated than in comparatively placid surroundings.","Brevity - the sister of talent.","In two or three hundred years life on earth will be unimaginably beautiful, astounding. Man needs such a life and if it hasn\'t yetappeared, he should begin to anticipate it, wait for it, dream about it, prepare for it. To achieve this, he has to see and know more than did his grandfather and father.","You only have to start a job of work to realize how few decent, honest folk there are about.","This man, who for twenty-five years has been reading and writing about art, and in all that time has never understood anything about art, has for twenty-five years been hashing over other people\'s ideas about realism, naturalism and all that nonsense; for twenty-five years he has been reading and writing about what intelligent people already know and about what stupid people don\'t want to know--which means that for twenty-five years he\'s been taking nothing and making nothing out of it. And with it all, what conceit! What pretension!","There is nothing new in art except talent.","Desription should be very brief and have an incidental nature.","But at the same time, in reality, what a difference there is between the world today, and what it used to be! And with the passage of more time, some two or three hundred years, say, people will look back at our own times with horror, or with sneering laughter, because all of our present day life will appear so clumsy, and burdensome, extraordinarily inept and strange. Yes, certainly, what a life it will be then, what a life!","He had two lives: one, open, seen and known by all who cared to know, full of relative truth and of relative falsehood, exactly like the lives of his friends and acquaintances; and another life running its course in secret. And through some strange, perhaps accidental, conjunction of circumstances, everything that was essential, of interest and of value to him, everything in which he was sincere and did not deceive himself, everything that made the kernel of his life, was hidden from other people.","Let the things that happen on the stage be just as complex and yet just as simple as they are in life. For instance, people are having a meal, just having a meal, but at the same time their happiness is being created, or their lives are being smashed up.","What truth? You see where truth is, and where untruth is, but I seem to have lost my sight and see nothing. You boldly settle all important questions, but tell me, dear, isn\'t it because you\'re young, because you haven\'t had time to suffer till you settled a single one of your questions? You boldly look forward, isn\'t it because you cannot foresee or expect anything terrible, because so far life has been hidden from your young eyes? You are bolder, more honest, deeper than we are, but think only, be just a little magnanimous, and have mercy on me.","It is not only the prisoners who grow coarse and hardened from corporal punishment, but those as well who perpetrate the act or are present to witness it.","Perhaps man has a hundred senses, and when he dies the five senses that we know perish with him, and the other ninety-five remain alive... Everything that is unattainable for us now will one day be near and clear... But we must work.","I\'ve been reading reviews of my stories for twenty-five years, and can\'t remember a single useful point in any of them, or the slightest good advice. The only reviewer who ever made an impression on me was Skabichevsky, who prophesied that I would die drunk in the bottom of a ditch.","..when one has no real life, one lives by mirages. It\'s still better than nothing.","Not only after two or three centuries, but in a million years, life will still be as it was; life does not change, it remains for ever, following its own laws which do not concern us, or which, at any rate, you will never find out. Migrant birds, cranes for example, fly and fly, and whatever thoughts, high or low, enter their heads, they will still fly and not know why or where. They fly and will continue to fly, whatever philosophers come to life among them; they may philosophize as much as they like, only they will fly.","One had better not rush, otherwise dung comes out rather than creative work.","My business is to be talented, that is, to be capable of selecting the important moments from the trivial ones. . . . It\'s about time for writers - particularly those who are genuine artists - to recognize that in this world you cannot figure out everything. Just have a writer who the crowds trust be courageous enough and declare that he does not understand everything, and that alone will represent a major contribution to the way people think, a long leap forward.","If ever my life can be of any use to you, come and claim it.","The wealthy man is not he who has money, but he who has the means to live in the luxurious state of early spring.","No psychologist should pretend to understand what he does not understand... Only fools and charlatans know everything and understand nothing.","I am not a liberal, not a conservative, not a believer in gradual progress, not a monk. I should like to be a free artist and nothing more.","To advise is not to compel.","These people have learned not from books, but in the fields, in the wood, on the river bank. Their teachers have been the birds themselves, when they sang to them, the sun when it left a glow of crimson behind it at setting, the very trees, and wild herbs.","Everyone judges plays as if they were very easy to write. They don\'t know that it is hard to write a good play, and twice as hardand tortuous to write a bad one.","I\'ve never been in love. I\'ve dreamt of it day and night, but my heart is like a fine piano no one can play because the key is lost.","I promise to be a splendid husband, but give me a wife who, like the moon, won\'t in my sky every day...","Silence accompanies the most significant expressions of happiness and unhappiness: those in love understand one another best when silent, while the most heated and impassioned speech at a graveside touches only outsiders, but seems cold and inconsequential to the widow and children of the deceased.","When you live on cash, you understand the limits of the world around which you navigate each day. Credit leads into a desert with invisible boundaries.","Pharisaism, obtuseness and tyranny reign not only in the homes of merchants and in jails; I see it in science, in literature, and among youth. I consider any emblem or label a prejudice.... My holy of holies is the human body, health, intellect, talent, inspiration, love and the most absolute of freedoms, the freedom from force and falsity in whatever forms they might appear.","Life is a vexatious trap; when a thinking man reaches maturity and attains to full consciousness he cannot help feeling that he is in a trap from which there is no escape.","Nothing better forges a bond of love, friendship or respect than common hatred toward something.","In my opinion it is harmful to place important things in the hands of philanthropy, which in Russia is marked by a chance character. Nor should important matters depend on leftovers, which are never there. I would prefer that the government treasury take care of it.","I divide all literary works into two categories: Those I like and those I don\'t like. No other criterion exists for me.","In displaying the psychology of your characters, minute particulars are essential. God save us from vague generalizations!","Thought and beauty, like a hurricane or waves, should not know conventional, delimited forms.","I often wonder: suppose we could begin life over again, knowing what we were doing? Suppose we could use one life, already ended, as a sort of rough draft for another? I think that every one of us would try, more than anything else, not to repeat himself, at the very least he would rearrange his manner of life, he would make sure of rooms like these, with flowers and light ... I have a wife and two daughters, my wife\'s health is delicate and so on and so on, and if I had to begin life all over again I would not marry. ... No, no!","An expansive life, one not constrained by four walls, requires as well an expansive pocket.","I confess I seldom commune with my conscience when I write.","There isn\'t a Monday that would not cede its place to Tuesday.","I agree that one can\'t dispense with the reins and the whip altogether, for knaves find their way even into literature, but no thinking will discover a better police for literature than the critics and the author\'s own conscience.","Everything I have written up to now is trifling compared to that which I would like to write and would write with great pleasureEither I am a fool and a self-conceited person, or I am a being capable of becoming a good writer; I am displeased and bored with everything now being written, while everything in my head interests, moves, and excites me-whence I draw the conclusion that no one is doing what is needed, and I alone know the secret of how it should be done. In all likelihood everyone who writes thinks that. In fact, the devil himself will be brought to his knees by these questions.","At the door of every happy person there should be a man with a hammer whose knock would serve as a constant reminder of the existence of unfortunate people.","Narrative prose is a legal wife, while drama is a posturing, boisterous, cheeky and wearisome mistress.","It\'s even pleasant to be sick when you know that there are people who await your recovery as they might await a holiday.","A fianc\xe9 is neither this nor that: he\'s left one shore, but not yet reached the other.","It is the writer\'s business not to accuse and not to prosecute, but to champion the guilty, once they are  condemned and suffer punishment.","There are no small number of people in this world who, solitary by nature, always try to go back into their shell like a hermit crab or a snail.","And only now, when he was gray-haired, had he fallen in love properly, thoroughly, for the first time in his life.","The leaves did not stir on the trees, grasshoppers chirruped, and the monotonous hollow sound of the sea rising up from below, spoke of the peace, of the eternal sleep awaiting us. So it must have sounded when there was no Yalta, no Oreanda here; so it sounds now, and it will sound as indifferently and monotonously when we are all no more. And in this constancy, in this complete indifference to the life and death of each of us, there lies hid, perhaps, a pledge of our eternal salvation, of the unceasing movement of life upon earth, of unceasing progress towards perfection.","For the salvation of his soul the Muslim digs a well. It would be a fine thing if each of us were to leave behind a school, or a well, or something of the sort, so that life would not pass by and retreat into eternity without a trace.","A sweet lie is more gracious for us than a virulent but real truth.","It is a bad thing if a writer tackles a subject he does not understand.","If you look at anything long enough, say just that wall in front of you - it will come out of that wall.","A woman is fascinated not by art but by the noise made by those in the field.","An artist must only judge of what he understands, his field is just as limited as that of any other specialist... That in his sphere there are no questions, but only answers, can only be maintained by those who have never written and have had no experience of thinking in images.","When a woman isn\'t beautiful, people always say, \'You have lovely eyes, you have lovely hair.\'","Even in Siberia there is happiness.","All of life and human relations have become so incomprehensibly complex that, when you think about it, it becomes terrifying and your heart stands still.","Revolting means for good ends make the ends of themselves revolting.","Oh, dreams! In one night, lying with one\'s eyes shut, one may sometimes live through more than ten years of happiness.","A man can deceive his fiancee or his mistress as much as he likes and, in the eyes of a woman he loves, an ass may pass for a philosopher. But a daughter is a different matter.","It doesn\'t matter that your painting is small. Kopecks are also small, but when a lot are put together they make a ruble. Each painting displayed in a gallery and each good book that makes it into a library, no matter how small they may be, serve a great cause: accretion of the national wealth.","Then I feel so happy and at the same time so sad, it\'s unimaginable.","Once a man gets a fixed idea, there\'s nothing to be done.","Dear and most respected bookcase! I welcome your existence, which has for over one hundred years been devoted to the radiant ideals of goodness and justice.","That can not possibly be, because it could never possibly be.","He who doesn\'t know how to be a servant should never be allowed to be a master; the interests of public life are alien to anyone who is unable to enjoy others\' successes, and such a person should never be entrusted with public affairs.","When men ask me how I know so much about men, they get a simple answer: everything I know about men, I learned from me.","If you say in the first chapter that there is a rifle hanging on the wall, in the second or third chapter it absolutely must go off. If it\'s not going to be fired, it shouldn\'t be hanging there.","Women writers should write a lot if they want to write. Take the English women, for example. What amazing workers.","One must speak about serious things seriously.","When performing an autopsy, even the most inveterate spiritualist would have to question where the soul is.","To a chemist, nothing on earth is unclean. A writer must be as objective as a chemist; he must abandon the subjective line; he must know that dungheaps play a very respectable part in a landscape, and that evil passions are as inherent in life as good ones.","An enormously vast field lies between \\"God exists\\" and \\"there is no God.\\" The truly wise man traverses it with great difficulty. A Russian knows one or the other of these two extremes, but is not interested in the middle ground. He usually knows nothing, or very little.","In countries where there is a mild climate, less effort is expended on the struggle with nature and man is kinder and more gentle.","In descriptions of Nature one must seize on small details, grouping them so that when the reader closes his eyes he gets a picture. For instance, you\'ll have a moonlit night if you write that on the mill dam a piece of glass from a broken bottle glittered like a bright little star, and that the black shadow of a dog or a wolf rolled past like a ball.","I\'ve noticed that people who get married cease to be curious.","When a man fails to understand something he is conscious of a discord, and seeks for the cause of it not in himself, as he should, but outside himself - hence the war with what he does not understand.","...and with a burning pain in my heart I realized how unnecessary, how petty, and how deceptive all that had hindered us from loving was. I understood that when you love you must either, in your reasonings about that love, start from what is highest, from what is more important than happiness or unhappiness, sin or virtue in their accepted meaning, or you must not reason at all.","You don\'t understand, you fool\' says Yegor, looking dreamily up at the sky. \'You\'ve never understood what kind of person I am, nor will you in a million years... You just think I\'m a mad person who has thrown his life away... Once the free spirit has taken hold of a man, there\'s no way of getting it out of him.","If only one tooth aches, rejoice that not all of them ache.... If your wife betrays you, be glad that she betrayed only you and not the nation.","Death is terrifying, but it would be even more terrifying to find out that you are going to live forever and never die.","I think that it would be less difficult to live eternally than to be deprived of sleep throughout life.","Do you know when you may concede your insignificance? Before God or, perhaps, before the intellect, beauty, or nature, but not before people. Among people, one must be conscious of one\'s dignity.","Not everyone knows how to be silent or to leave in good time. It happens that even people of good breeding fail to notice that their presence provokes in the weary or preoccupied host a feeling akin to hatred, and that this feeling is tensely concealed and covered up with lies.","We old bachelors smell like dogs, do we? So be it. But I must take issue with your claim that doctors who treat female illnesses are womanizers and cynics at heart. Gynecologists deal with savage prose the likes of which you have never dreamed of.","It\'s immoral to steal, but you can take things.","It always seems to the brothers and the father that their brother or son didn\'t marry the right person.","The desire to serve the common good must without fail be a requisite of the soul, a necessity for personal happiness; if it issuesnot from there, but from theoretical or other considerations, it is not at all the same thing.","I should like to meet a philosopher like Nietzsche somewhere in a train or a steamer, and to spend the whole night talking to him. I consider his philosophy won\'t last long, however. It\'s more showy than convincing.","When you describe the miserable and unfortunate, and want to make the reader feel pity, try to be somewhat colder - that seems to give a kind of background to another\'s grief, against which it stands out more clearly. Whereas in your story the characters cry and you sigh. Yes, be more cold. ... The more objective you are, the stronger will be the impression you make.","One can prove or refute anything at all with words. Soon people will perfect language technology to such an extent that they\'ll be proving with mathematical precision that twice two is seven.","To harbor spiteful feelings against ordinary people for not being heroes is possible only for narrow-minded or embittered man.","A man who doesn\'t drink is not, in my opinion, fully a man.","Solomon made a big mistake when he asked for wisdom.","Critics are like horse-flies which hinder the horses in their plowing of the soil. The horse works, all its muscles drawn tight like the strings on a double-bass, and a fly settles on his flanks and tickles and buzzes. And what does the fly buzz about? It scarcely knows itself; simply because it is restless and wants to proclaim: \'Look, I too am living on the earth. See, I can buzz, too, buzz about anything.\'","While you\'re playing cards with a regular guy or having a bite to eat with him, he seems a peaceable, good-humoured and not entirely dense person. But just begin a conversation with him about something inedible, politics or science, for instance, and he ends up in a deadend or starts in on such an obtuse and base philosophy that you can only wave your hand and leave.","Probably nature itself gave man the ability to lie so that in difficult and tense moments he could protect his nest, just as do the vixen and wild duck.","The wealthy are always surrounded by hangers-on; science and art are as well.","Please, understand that your life is bad and dreary!","A writer should not so much write as embroider on paper; the work should be painstaking, laborious.","By nature servile, people attempt at first glance to find signs of good breeding in the appearance of those who occupy more exalted stations.","By poeticizing love, we imagine in those we love virtues that they often do not possess; this then becomes the source of constant mistakes and constant distress.","Wherever there is degeneration and apathy, there also is sexual perversion, cold depravity, miscarriage, premature old age, grumbling youth, there is a decline in the arts, indifference to science, and injustice in all its forms.","In Moscow you sit in a huge room at a restaurant; you know no one and no one knows you, and at the same time you don\'t feel a stranger. But here you know everyone and everyone knows you, and yet you are a stranger - a stranger... A stranger, and lonely...","The time\'s come: there\'s a terrific thunder-cloud advancing upon us, a mighty storm is coming to freshen us up....It\'s going to blow away all this idleness and indifference, and prejudice against work....I\'m going to work, and in twenty-five or thirty years\' time every man and woman will be working.","The air of one\'s native country is the most healthy air.","I still lack a political, religious and philosophical world view - I change it every month - and so I\'ll have to limit myself to descriptions of how my heroes love, marry, give birth, die, and how they speak.","Write about this man who, drop by drop, squeezes the slave\'s blood out of himself until he wakes one day to find the blood of a real human being--not a slave\'s--coursing through his veins.","And I despise your books, I despise wisdom and the blessings of this world. It is all worthless, fleeting, illusory, and deceptive, like a mirage. You may be proud, wise, and fine, but death will wipe you off the face of the earth as though you were no more than mice burrowing under the floor, and your posterity, your history, your immortal geniuses will burn or freeze together with the earthly globe.","I long to embrace, to include in my own short life, all that is accessible to man. I long to speak, to read, to wield a hammer in a great factory, to keep watch at sea, to plow. I want to be walking along the Nevsky Prospect, or in the open fields, or on the ocean - wherever my imagination ranges.","A tree is beautiful, but what\'s more, it has a right to life; like water, the sun and the stars, it is essential. Life on earth is inconceivable without trees. Forests create climate, climate influences peoples\' character, and so on and so forth. There can be neither civilization nor happiness if forests crash down under the axe, if the climate is harsh and severe, if people are also harsh and severe. ... What a terrible future!","I was so drunk the whole time that I took bottles for girls and girls for bottles.","We go to great pains to alter life for the happiness of our descendants and our descendants will say as usual: things used to be so much better, life today is worse than it used to be.","But if you had asked him what his work was, he would look candidly and openly at you with his large bright eyes through his gold pincenez, and would answer in a soft, velvety, lisping baritone: \\"My work is literature.\\"","One must be a god to be able to tell successes from failures without making a mistake.","I am writing a play which I probably will not finish until the end of November. I am writing it with considerable pleasure, though I sin frightfully against the conventions of the stage. It is a comedy with three female parts, six male, four acts, a landscape (view of the lake), lots of talk on literature, little action and tons of love.","When one sees one of the romantic creatures before him he imagines he is looking at some holy being, so wonderful that its one breath could dissolve him in a sea of a thousand charms and delights; but if one looks into the soul -- it\'s nothing but a common crocodile.","Happiness does not await us all. One needn\'t be a prophet to say that there will be more grief and pain than serenity and money. That is why we must hang on to one another.","The sea has neither meaning nor pity.","Flies purify the air, and plays - the morals.","Love is a scandal of the personal sort.","If there is a gun hanging on the wall in the first act, it must fire in the last.","I feel more confident and more satisfied when I reflect that I have two professions and not one. Medicine is my lawful wife and literature is my mistress. When I get tired of one I spend the night with the other. Though it\'s disorderly it\'s not so dull, and besides, neither really loses anything, through my infidelity.","If there\'s a gun on the wall in act one, scene one, you must fire the gun by act three, scene two. If you fire a gun in act three, scene two, you must see the gun on the wall in act one, scene one.","In Western Europe people perish from the congestion and stifling closeness, but with us it is from the spaciousness.... The expanses are so great that the little man hasn\'t the resources to orient himself.... This is what I think about Russian suicides.","Life has gone by as if I never lived","Watching a woman make Russian pancakes, you might think that she was calling on the spirits or extracting from the batter the philosopher\'s stone.","There ought to be a man with a hammer behind the door of every happy man.","Man has been endowed with reason, with the power to create, so that he can add to what he\'s been given.","A litterateur is not a confectioner, not a dealer in cosmetics, not an entertainer. . . . He is just like an ordinary reporter. What would you say if a newspaper reporter, because of his fastidiousness or from a wish to give pleasure to his readers, were to describe only honest mayors, high-minded ladies, and virtuous railroad contractors.","Nothing lulls and inebriates like money; when you have a lot, the world seems a better place than it actually is.","A writer is not a confectioner, a cosmetic dealer, or an entertainer.","From here, far away, people seem very good, and that is natural, for in going away into the country we are not hiding from people but from our vanity, which in town among people is unjust and active beyond measure.","To live simply to die is by no means amusing, but to live with the knowledge that you will die before your time, that\'s really is idiotic","The thirst for powerful sensations takes the upper hand both over fear and over compassion for the grief of others.","Our pride and self-importance are European, while our development and actions are Asiatic.","When a lot of remedies are suggested for a disease, that means it can\'t be cured.","It is uncomfortable to ask condemned people about their sentences just as it is awkward to ask wealthy people why they need so much money, why they use their wealth so poorly, and why they don\'t just get rid of it when they recognize that it is the cause of their unhappiness.","Hypocrisy is a revolting, psychopathic state.","Russian forests crash down under the axe, billions of trees are dying, the habitations of animals and birds are laid waste, rivers grow shallow and dry up, marvelous landscapes are disappearing forever.... Man is endowed with creativity in order to multiply that which has been given him; he has not created, but destroyed. There are fewer and fewer forests, rivers are drying up, wildlife has become extinct, the climate is ruined, and the earth is becoming ever poorer and uglier.","Children are holy and pure. Even those of bandits and crocodiles belong among the angels.... They must not be turned into a plaything of one\'s mood, first to be tenderly kissed, then rabidly stomped at.","You look at any poetic creature: muslin, ether, demigoddess, millions of delights; then you look into the soul and find the most ordinary crocodile!","Indeed, in Russia there is a terrible poverty of facts, and a terrible abundance of reflections of all sorts.","If one wants to lead a good life, A HUMAN LIFE, one must work.","The time has come for writers, especially those who are artists, to admit that in this world one cannot make anything out, just as Socrates once admitted it, just as Voltaire admitted it.","Humankind has understood history as a series of battles because, to this day, it regards conflict as the central facet of life.","A hungry dog believes in nothing but meat.","It is easier to ask of the poor than of the rich.","The University brings out all abilities, including incapability.","Advertising is the very essence of democracy.","One usually dislikes a play while writing it, but afterward it grows on one. Let others judge and make decisions.","Your talent sets you apart: if you were a toad or a tarantula, even then, people would respect you, for to talent all things are forgiven.","Anna Petrovna: Never talk to women about your own good qualities. Let them find out for themselves.","In my head there is a whole army of people asking to be let out and waiting for the word of command.","I do not know why one should not hunt two hares even in the literal sense....","It\'s easier to write about Socrates than about a young woman or a cook.","If you fear loneliness, then don\'t get married.","It\'s better to live down a scandal than to ruin one\'s life.","I should think I\'m going to be a perpetual student.","Anyone who says the artist\'s field is all answers and no questions has never done any writing or had any dealings with imageryYou are confusing two concepts: answering the questions and formulating them correctly. Only the latter is required of an author.","Life is difficult for those who have the daring to first set out on an unknown road. The avant-garde always has a bad time of it.","If you can\'t distinguish people from lap-dogs, you shouldn\'t undertake philanthropic work.","My mistress has come home; at last I\'ve seen her. Now I\'m ready to die.","When you want to touch the reader\'s heart, try to be colder. It gives their grief as it were, a background, against which it stands out in greater relief.","To Moscow, to Moscow, to Moscow!","My holy of holies is the human body.","Country acquaintances are charming only in the country and only in the summer. In the city in winter they lose half of their appeal.","I don\'t like being successful; the subjects which sit in my head are annoyed and jealous of what has already been written.","He is no longer a city dweller who has even once in his life caught a ruff or seen how, on clear and cool autumn days, flocks of migrating thrushes drift over a village. Until his death he will be drawn to freedom.","It\'s worth living abroad to study up on genteel and delicate manners. The maid smiles continuously; she smiles like a duchess on a stage, while at the same time it is clear from her face that she is exhausted from overwork.","In Russia there is no philosophy, but philosophize everything, even the small fry.","I have no will of my own. Never did. Limp and lily-livered, I always obey - is it possible that\'s attractive to women?","What must human beings be, to destroy what they can never create?","In descriptions of nature one must seize on small details, grouping them so that when the reader closes his eyes he gets a picture.","Great Jove angry is no longer Jove.","Neither I nor anyone else knows what a standard is. We all recognize a dishonorable act, but have no idea what honor is.","Nature\'s law says that the strong must prevent the weak from living, but only in a newspaper article or textbook can this be packaged into a comprehensible thought. In the soup of everyday life, in the mixture of minutia from which human relations are woven, it is not a law. It is a logical incongruity when both strong and weak fall victim to their mutual relations, unconsciously subservient to some unknown guiding power that stands outside of life, irrelevant to man.","Anna Petrovna (to Shabelsky): You can\'t make a simple joke without an injection of venom. You are a poisonous man. Joking apart, Count, you\'re very poisonous. It\'s hideously boring to live with you. You\'re always grumpy, complaining, you find everyone bad, good for nothing. Tell me frankly, Count, did you ever speak well of anyone?","Whoever sincerely believes that elevated and distant goals are as little use to man as a cow, that \\"all of our problems\\" come fromsuch goals, is left to eat, drink, sleep, or, when he gets sick of that, to run up to a chest and smash his forehead on its corner.","Ah, Caviar! I keep on eating it, but can never get my fill. Like olives. It\'s a lucky thing it\'s not salty.","The stupider the peasant, the better the horse understands him.","Do you remember you shot a seagull? A man came by chance, saw it and destroyed it, just to pass the time.","It is as acceptable now to love the wives of others as it is to smoke their cigars and read their books.","You look boldly ahead; isn\'t it only that you don\'t see or divine anything terrible in the future; because life is still hidden from your young eyes.","One must not put a loaded rifle on the stage if no one is thinking of firing it.","Fine. Since the tea is not forthcoming, let\'s have a philosophical conversation.","To dine, drink champagne, raise a racket and make speeches about the people\'s consciousness, the people\'s conscience, freedom andso forth while servants in tails are scurrying around your table, just like serfs, and out in the severe cold on the street await coachmen--this is the same as lying to the holy spirit.","What\'s the use of talking? You can see for yourself that this is a barbarous country; the people have no morals; and the boredom!","Every coming year is as bad as the previous one, the only difference being that in most cases it is even worse.","Life does not agree with philosophy: There is no happiness that is not idleness, and only what is useless is pleasurable.","I abide by a rule concerning reviews: I will never ask, neither in writing nor in person, that a word be put in about my book.... One feels cleaner this way. When someone asks that his book be reviewed he risks running up against a vulgarity offensive to authorial sensibilities.","People understand God as the expression of the most lofty morality. Maybe He needs only perfect people.","There are people whom even children\'s literature would corrupt. They read with particular enjoyment the piquant passages in the Psalter and in the Wisdom of Solomon.","Those who come a hundred or two hundred years after us will despise us for having lived our lives so stupidly and tastelessly. Perhaps they\'ll find a means to be happy.","When one longs for a drink, it seems as though one could drink a whole ocean-that is faith; but when one begins to drink, one can only drink altogether two glasses-that is science.","Faith is a capacity of the spirit. It is like talent: you have to be born with it","Can words such as Orthodox, Jew, or Catholic really express some sort of exclusive personal virtues or merits?","Eyes - the head\'s chief of police. They watch and make mental notes.","You are right in demanding that an artist approach his work consciously, but you are confusing two concepts: the solution of a problem and the correct formulation of a problem. Only the second is required of the artist.","If you cry \'forward\', you must without fail make plain in what direction to go.","In one-act pieces there should be only rubbish - that is their strength.","Idea for a short story. The shore of a lake, a young girl who\'s spent her whole life beside it, a girl like you She loves the lake the way a seagull does, and she\'s happy and free as a seagull. Then a man comes along, sees her, and ruins her life because he has nothing better to do. Destroys her like this seagull here.","He always seemed to women different from what he was, and they loved in him not himself, but the man created by their imagination, whom they had been eagerly seeking all their lives; and afterwards, when they noticed their mistake, they loved him all the same.","When a person hasn\'t in him that which is higher and stronger than all external influences, it is enough for him to catch a good cold in order to lose his equilibrium and begin to see an owl in every bird, to hear a dog\'s bark in every sound.","I would like to be a free artist and nothing else, and I regret God has not given me the strength to be one.","There are in life conjunctions of circumstances when the reproach that we are not Voltaires is least of all appropriate.","It\'s been a long time since I\'ve had champagne.","The more elevated a culture, the richer its language. The number of words and their combinations depends directly on a sum of conceptions and ideas; without the latter there can be no understandings, no definitions, and, as a result, no reason to enrich a language.","I let myself go at the beginning and write with an easy mind, but by the time I get to the middle I begin to grow timid and to fear my story will be too long. . .That is why the beginning of my stories is always very promising and looks as though I were starting on a novel, and the middle is huddled and timid, and the end is...like fireworks.","Satiation, like any state of vitality, always contains a degree of impudence, and that impudence emerges first and foremost when the sated man instructs the hungry one.","A man wants nothing so badly as a gooseberry farm.","Posterity will say as usual: \\"In the past things were better, the present is worse than the past.","Writers are as jealous as pigeons.","It is depressing to hear the unfortunate or dying man jest.","A tree is beautiful, but what\'s more, it has a right to life; like water, the sun and the stars, it is essential. Life on earth is inconceivable without trees.","Sometimes we go to a play and after the curtain has been up five minutes we have a sense of being able to settle back in the arms of the playwright. Instinctively we know that the playwright knows his business.","Who keeps the tavern and serves up the drinks? The peasant. Who squanders and drinks up money belonging to the peasant commune, the school, the church? The peasant. Who would steal from his neighbor, commit arson, and falsely denounce another for a bottle of vodka? The peasant.","How unbearable at times are people who are happy, people for whom everything works out.","I swear fearfully at the conventions of the stage.","To believe in God is not hard. Inquisitors, Byron and Arakcheev believed in Him. No, believe in man!","I am now and have always been a stranger to the realm of practical matters.","People who lead a lonely existence always have something on their minds that they are eager to talk about.","To make a face from marble means to remove from the slab everything that is not the face","A person loves to talk about his illnesses although that is the least interesting part of his life.","Instructing in cures, therapists always recommend that \\"each case be individualized.\\" If this advice is followed, one becomes persuaded that those means recommended in textbooks as the best, means perfectly appropriate for the template case, turn out to be completely unsuitable in individual cases.","The personal life of every individual is based on secrecy, and perhaps it is partly for that reason that civilized man is so nervously anxious that personal privacy should be respected.","The critics suppose that it is easy to write a play. They aren\'t aware that writing a good play is difficult and writing a bad one is twice as hard.","And what does it mean -- dying? Perhaps man has a hundred senses, and only the five we know are lost at death, while the other ninety-five remain alive.","Death can only be profitable: there\'s no need to eat, drink, pay taxes, offend people, and since a person lies in a grave for hundreds or thousands of years, if you count it up the profit turns out to be enormous.","In all my life I never met anyone so frivolous as you two, so crazy and unbusinesslike. I tell you in plain Russian your property is going to be sold and you don\'t seem to understand what I say.","And it is the way with us that you may express disapproval of the sun or the moon, or anything you like, but God preserve you from touching the Liberals! Heaven forbid!","A naive man is nothing better than a fool. But you women contrive to be naive in such a way that in you it seems sweet, and gentle, and proper, and not as silly as it really is.","Lermontov died at age twenty-eight and wrote more than have you and I put together. Talent is recognizable not only by quality, but also by the quantity it yields.","Everything is good in due measure and strong sensations know not measure.","A grimy fly can soil the entire wall and a small, dirty little act can ruin the entire proceedings.","It seems to me that all of the evil in life comes from idleness, boredom, and psychic emptiness, but all of that is inevitable when you become accustomed to living at others\' expense.","Isolation in creative work is an onerous thing. Better to have negative criticism than nothing at all.","Art, especially the stage, is an area where it is impossible to walk without stumbling.","Is it our job to judge? The gendarme, policemen and bureaucrats have been especially prepared by fate for that job. Our job is towrite, and only to write.","You\'ve only got to begin to do anything to find out how few honest, honourable people there are. Sometimes, when I can\'t sleep, I think: \\"Oh Lord, you\'ve given us huge forests, infinite fields, and endless horizons, and we, living here, ought really to be giants.","There will come a time when everybody will know why, for what purpose, there is all this suffering, and there will be no more mysteries. But now we must live ... we must work, just work!","There is no national science, just as there is no national multiplication table; what is national is no longer science.","\\"Do you know,\\" Ivan Bunin recalls Anton Chekhov saying to him in 1899, near the end of his too-short life, \\"for how many years I shall be read? Seven.\\" \\"Why seven?\\" Bunin asked. \\"Well,\\" Chekhov answered, \\"seven and a half then.\\"","I am dying. I haven\'t drunk champagne for a long time.","Dear, sweet, unforgettable childhood! Why does this irrevocable time, forever departed, seem brighter, more festive and richer than it actually was?","The more simply we look at ticklish questions, the more placid will be our lives and relationships.","An artist\'s flair is sometimes worth a scientist\'s brains.","When an actor has money he doesn\'t send letters, he sends telegrams.","I can\'t accept \\"our nervous age,\\" since mankind has been nervous during every age. Whoever fears nervousness should turn into a sturgeon or smelt; if a sturgeon makes a stupid mistake, it can only be one: to end up on a hook, and then in a pan in a pastry shell.","Useless pursuits and conversations always about the same things absorb the better part of one\'s time, the better part of one\'s strength, and in the end there is left a life grovelling and curtailed, worthless and trivial, and there is no escaping or getting away from it\u2014just as though one were in a madhouse or prison.","The past,\' he thought, \'is linked with the present by an unbroken chain of events flowing one out of another.\' And it seemed to him that he had just seen both ends of that chain; that when he touched one end the other quivered.","No matter how corrupt and unjust a convict may be, he loves fairness more than anything else. If the people placed over him are unfair, from year to year he lapses into an embittered state characterized by an extreme lack of faith.","Once you\'ve married, be strict but just with your wife, don\'t allow her to forget herself, and when a misunderstanding arises, say: \\"Don\'t forget that I made you happy.","Sports are positively essential. It is healthy to engage in sports, they are beautiful and liberal, liberal in the sense that nothing serves quite as well to integrate social classes, etc., than street or public games.","If many remedies are prescribed for an illness you can be sure it has no cure","Here I am with you & yet not for a single moment do I forget that there\'s an unfinished novel waiting for me.","Reason and justice tell me there\'s more love for humanity in electricity and steam than in chastity and vegetarianism.","Ivanov: Once I worked hard and thought a lot but I never got tired; now I do nothing and think of nothing, but I\'m tired in body and spirit. My conscience aches day and night, I feel deeply guilty but I don\'t understand where I am actually at fault. And add to that my wife\'s illness, my lack of money, the constant bickering, gossip, unnecessary conversations, that stupid Borkin... My home has become loathsome to me and I find living there worse than torture.","Never bring a cannon on stage in Act I unless you intend to fire it by the last act.","To describe drunkenness for the colorful vocabulary is rather cynical. There is nothing easier than to capitalize on drunkards.","When you\'re thirsty and it seems that you could drink the entire ocean that\'s faith; when you start to drink and finish only a glass or two that\'s science.","Tsars and slaves, the intelligent and the obtuse, publicans and pharisees all have an identical legal and moral right to honor the memory of the deceased as they see fit, without regard for anyone else\'s opinion and without the fear of hindering one another.","God\'s world is a good place. The one thing not good in it is we. How little justice and humility there is in us. How little we understand true patriotism!","I will begin with what in my opinion is your lack of restraint. You are like a spectator in a theatre who expresses his enthusiasm so unrestrainedly that he prevents himself and others from hearing. That lack of restraint is particularly noticeable in the descriptions of nature with which you interrupt dialogues; when one reads them, these descriptions, one wishes they were more compact, shorter, say two or three lines.","One must never place a loaded rifle on the stage if it isn\'t going to go off. It\'s wrong to make promises you don\'t mean to keep.","Only those young people can be accepted as healthy who refuse to be reconciled with the old order and foolishly or wisely struggle against it - such is the will of nature...","You are right in demanding that an artist should take an intelligent attitude to his work, but you confuse two things: solving a problem and stating a problem correctly.","Love is a great thing. It is not by chance that in all times and practically among all cultured peoples love in the general senseand the love of a man for his wife are both called love. If love is often cruel or destructive, the reasons lie not in love itself, but in the inequality between people.","All the great sages are as despotic as generals, and as ignorant and as indelicate as generals, because they feel secure of impunity.","Oh, I don\'t object, of course, to cutting wood from necessity, but why destroy the forests? The woods of Russia are trembling under the blows of the axe. Millions of trees have perished. The homes of the wild animals and birds have been desolated; the rivers are shrinking, and many beautiful landscapes are gone forever. And why? Because men are too lazy and stupid to stoop down and pick up their fuel from the ground.","I\'m in mourning for my life.","Of course politics is an interesting and engrossing thing. It offers no immutable laws, nearly always prevaricates, but as far asblather and sharpening the mind go, it provides inexhaustible material.","Dear, sweet, unforgettable childhood!","If in the first act you have hung a pistol on the wall, then in the following one it should be fired. Otherwise don\'t put it there.","If I were asked to chose between execution and life in prison I would, of course, chose the latter. It\'s better to live somehow than not at all.","Capital punishment kills immediately, whereas lifetime imprisonment does so slowly. Which executioner is more humane? The one who kills you in a few minutes, or the one who wrests your life from you in the course of many years?","Moscow is a city that has much suffering ahead of it.","[Ognev] recalled endless, heated, purely Russian arguments, when the wranglers, spraying spittle and banging their fists on the table, fail to understand yet interrupt one another, themselves not even noticing it, contradict themselves with every phrase, change the subject, then, having argued for two or three hours, begin to laugh.","We live not in order to eat, but in order not to know what we feel like eating.","It is always \\"Youth, youth,\\" when there is nothing else to be said.","The people I am afraid of are the ones who look for tendentiousness between the lines and are determined to see me as either liberal or conservative. I am neither liberal, nor conservative, nor gradualist, nor monk, nor indifferentist.

Don\'t you see that if you fail to do that and simply call out the word to a monk and a revolutionary, they will go in precisely opposite directions?","I was oppressed with a sense of vague discontent and dissatisfaction with my own life, which was passing so quickly and uninterestingly, and I kept thinking it would be a good thing if I could tear my heart out of my breast, that heart which had grown so weary of life.","we all have too many wheels, screws and valves to judge each other on first impressions or one or two pointers.

They do not create scenes over a hammer or a mislaid eraser; they do not make you feel they are conferring a great benefit on you when they live with you, and they don\'t make a scandal when they leave. (...)2) They have compassion for other people besides beggars and cats. Their hearts suffer the pain of what is hidden to the naked eye. (...)3) They respect other people\'s property, and therefore pay their debts.4) They are not devious, and they fear lies as they fear fire. They don\'t tell lies even in the most trivial matters. To lie to someone is to insult them, and the liar is diminished in the eyes of the person he lies to. Civilized people don\'t put on airs; they behave in the street as they would at home, they don\'t show off to impress their juniors. (...)5) They don\'t run themselves down in order to provoke the sympathy of others. They don\'t play on other people\'s heartstrings to be sighed over and cosseted ... that sort of thing is just cheap striving for effects, it\'s vulgar, old hat and false. (...)6) They are not vain. They don\'t waste time with the fake jewellery of hobnobbing with celebrities, being permitted to shake the hand of a drunken [judicial orator], the exaggerated bonhomie of the first person they meet at the Salon, being the life and soul of the bar ... They regard prases like \'I am a representative of the Press!!\' -- the sort of thing one only hears from [very minor journalists] -- as absurd. If they have done a brass farthing\'s work they don\'t pass it off as if it were 100 roubles\' by swanking about with their portfolios, and they don\'t boast of being able to gain admission to places other people aren\'t allowed in (...) True talent always sits in the shade, mingles with the crowd, avoids the limelight ... As Krylov said, the empty barrel makes more noise than the full one. (...)7) If they do possess talent, they value it ... They take pride in it ... they know they have a responsibility to exert a civilizing influence on [others] rather than aimlessly hanging out with them. And they are fastidious in their habits. (...)8) They work at developing their aesthetic sensibility ... Civilized people don\'t simply obey their baser instincts ... they require mens sana in corpore sano.And so on. That\'s what civilized people are like ... Reading Pickwick and learning a speech from Faust by heart is not enough if your aim is to become a truly civilized person and not to sink below the level of your surroundings.[From a letter to Nikolay Chekhov, March 1886]","If you are afraid of loneliness, don\'t marry.","There should be more sincerity and heart in human relations, more silence and simplicity in our interactions. Be rude when you\u2019re angry, laugh when something is funny, and answer when you\u2019re asked.","To fear love is to fear life, and those whose fear life are already three parts dead...","There are a great many opinions in this world, and a good half of them are professed by people who have never been in trouble.\\"(The Mill)","If my life can ever be of any use to you, come and take it.","Be sure not to discuss your hero\'s state of mind.

You look at life: the insolence and idleness of the strong, the ignorance and brutishness of the weak, incredible poverty all about us, overcrowding, degeneration, drunkenness, hypocrisy, lying... Yet all is calm and stillness in the houses and in the streets; of the fifty thousand living in a town, there s not one who would cry out, who would give vent to his indignation aloud.

For instance: you will capture the truth of a moonlit night if you\'ll write that a gleam like starlight shone from the pieces of a broken bottle, and then the dark, plump shadow of a dog or wolf appeared. You will bring life to nature only if you don\'t shrink from similes that liken its activities to those of humankind.\\"(Letter to Alexander Chekhov, May 10, 1886)","let us learn to appreciate there will be times when the trees will be bare, and look forward to the time when we may pick the fruit.","\u0627\u0646\u062a\u0638\u0631\u064a \u0642\u0644\u064a\u0644\u0627 \u0644\u0627 \u062a\u062a\u0639\u062c\u0644\u064a .. \u0641\u0644\u062f\u064a\u0646\u0627 \u0645\u0627 \u064a\u0643\u0641\u064a \u0645\u0646 \u0627\u0644\u0648\u0642\u062a .. \u0643\u064a \u0646\u0635\u0627\u0628 \u0628\u0627\u0644\u062e\u064a\u0628\u0629 .","In Moscow you sit in a huge room at a restaurant; you know no one and no one knows you, and at the same time you don\'t feel a stranger.

What an overwhelming force! Just consider this life--the insolence and idleness of the strong, the ignorance and bestiality of the weak, all around intolerable poverty, cramped dwellings, degeneracy, drunkenness, hypocrisy, lying...and yet peace and order apparently prevail in all those homes and in the streets. Of the fifty thousand inhabitants of a town, not one will be found to cry out, to proclaim his indignation aloud. We see those who go to the market to buy food, who eat in the daytime and sleep at night, who prattle away, marry, grow old, carry their dead to the cemeteries. But we neither hear nor see those who suffer, and the terrible things in life are played out behind the scenes. All is calm and quiet, and statistics, which are dumb, protest: so many have gone mad, so many barrels of drink have been consumed, so many children died of malnutrition...and apparently this is as it should be. Apparently those who are happy can only enjoy themselves because the unhappy bear their burdens in silence, and but for this silence happiness would be impossible. It is a kind of universal hypnosis. There ought to be a man with a hammer behind the door of every happy man, to remind him by his constant knocks that there are unhappy people, and that happy as he himself may be, life will sooner or later show him its claws, catastrophe will overtake him--sickness, poverty, loss--and nobody will see it, just as he now neither sees nor hears the misfortunes of others. But there is no man with a hammer, the happy man goes on living and the petty vicissitudes of life touch him lightly, like the wind in an aspen-tree, and all is well.","They say, tell me what you\'ve read and I\'ll tell you who you are.","In displaying the psychology of your characters, minute particulars are essential.

[He looks at his watch] Excuse me, I must go at once, and begin writing again. I am in a hurry. [He laughs] You have stepped on my pet corn, as they say, and I am getting excited, and a little cross. Let us discuss this bright and beautiful life of mine, though. [After a few moments\' thought] Violent obsessions sometimes lay hold of a man: he may, for instance, think day and night of nothing but the moon. I have such a moon. Day and night I am held in the grip of one besetting thought, to write, write, write! Hardly have I finished one book than something urges me to write another, and then a third, and then a fourth--I write ceaselessly. I am, as it were, on a treadmill. I hurry for ever from one story to another, and can\'t help myself. Do you see anything bright and beautiful in that? Oh, it is a wild life! Even now, thrilled as I am by talking to you, I do not forget for an instant that an unfinished story is awaiting me. My eye falls on that cloud there, which has the shape of a grand piano; I instantly make a mental note that I must remember to mention in my story a cloud floating by that looked like a grand piano. I smell heliotrope; I mutter to myself: a sickly smell, the colour worn by widows; I must remember that in writing my next description of a summer evening. I catch an idea in every sentence of yours or of my own, and hasten to lock all these treasures in my literary store-room, thinking that some day they may be useful to me. As soon as I stop working I rush off to the theatre or go fishing, in the hope that I may find oblivion there, but no! Some new subject for a story is sure to come rolling through my brain like an iron cannonball. I hear my desk calling, and have to go back to it and begin to write, write, write, once more. And so it goes for everlasting. I cannot escape myself, though I feel that I am consuming my life. To prepare the honey I feed to unknown crowds, I am doomed to brush the bloom from my dearest flowers, to tear them from their stems, and trample the roots that bore them under foot. Am I not a madman? Should I not be treated by those who know me as one mentally diseased? Yet it is always the same, same old story, till I begin to think that all this praise and admiration must be a deception, that I am being hoodwinked because they know I am crazy, and I sometimes tremble lest I should be grabbed from behind and whisked off to a lunatic asylum. The best years of my youth were made one continual agony for me by my writing. A young author, especially if at first he does not make a success, feels clumsy, ill-at-ease, and superfluous in the world. His nerves are all on edge and stretched to the point of breaking; he is irresistibly attracted to literary and artistic people, and hovers about them unknown and unnoticed, fearing to look them bravely in the eye, like a man with a passion for gambling, whose money is all gone. I did not know my readers, but for some reason I imagined they were distrustful and unfriendly; I was mortally afraid of the public, and when my first play appeared, it seemed to me as if all the dark eyes in the audience were looking at it with enmity, and all the blue ones with cold indifference. Oh, how terrible it was! What agony!","The snow has not yet left the earth, but spring is already asking to enter your heart. If you have ever recovered from a serious illness, you will be familiar with the blessed state when you are in a delicious state of anticipation, and are liable to smile without any obvious reason. Evidently that is what nature is experiencing just now. The ground is cold, mud and snow squelches under foot, but how cheerful, gentle and inviting everything is! The air is so clear and transparent that if you were to climb to the top of the pigeon loft or the bell tower, you feel you might actually see the whole universe from end to end. The sun is shining brightly, and its playful, beaming rays are bathing in the puddles along with the sparrows. The river is swelling and darkening; it has already woken up and very soon will begin to roar. The trees are bare, but they are already living and breathing.","My thoughts about human happiness, for some peculiar reason, had always been tinged with a certain sadness.","One hundred years from now, the people who come after us, for whom our lives are showing the way--will they think of us kindly?

Ah, then dear, dear Uncle, we shall see that bright and beautiful life; we shall rejoice and look back upon our sorrow here; a tender smile\u2014and\u2014we shall rest.

He began to judge others by himself, no longer believing what he saw, and always assuming that the real, the only interesting life of every individual goes on as under cover of night, secretly. Every individual existence revolves around mystery, and perhaps that is the chief reason that all cultivated individuals insisted so strongly on the respect due to personal secrets.","\u0645\u0627 \u0647\u0630\u0647 \u0627\u0644\u0644\u064a\u0627\u0644\u064a \u0627\u0644\u062a\u064a \u0628\u0644\u0627 \u0645\u0639\u0646\u0649 \u0648\u0623\u064a \u0623\u064a\u0627\u0645 \u0645\u0645\u0644\u0629 \u0628\u0627\u0647\u062a\u0629 ! \u0627\u0644\u0644\u0639\u0628 \u0627\u0644\u0645\u062d\u0645\u0648\u0645 \u0648\u0627\u0644\u0623\u0643\u0644 \u062d\u062a\u0649 \u0627\u0644\u062a\u062e\u0645\u0629 \u0648\u0627\u0644\u0633\u064c\u0643\u0652\u0631 \u0648\u0627\u0644\u0623\u062d\u0627\u062f\u064a\u062b \u0627\u0644\u0645\u0643\u0631\u0631\u0629 \u0639\u0646 \u0646\u0641\u0633 \u0627\u0644\u0634\u064a\u0621. \u0627\u0644\u0623\u0639\u0645\u0627\u0644 \u0627\u0644\u062a\u064a \u0644\u0627 \u0636\u0631\u0648\u0631\u0629 \u0644\u0647\u0627 \u0648\u0627\u0644\u0623\u062d\u0627\u062f\u064a\u062b \u0627\u0644\u0645\u0643\u0631\u0631\u0629 \u062a\u0633\u062a\u0648\u0644\u0649 \u0639\u0644\u0649 \u0623\u0641\u0636\u0644 \u0633\u0627\u0639\u0627\u062a \u0627\u0644\u0639\u0645\u0631 \u0648\u0639\u0644\u0649 \u0623\u0641\u0636\u0644 \u0627\u0644\u0642\u0648\u0649 \u0648\u0644\u0627 \u064a\u0628\u0642\u0649 \u0641\u064a \u0627\u0644\u0646\u0647\u0627\u064a\u0629 \u0633\u0648\u0649 \u062d\u064a\u0627\u0629 \u0645\u0628\u062a\u0648\u0631\u0629\u060c \u0645\u0642\u0635\u0648\u0635\u0629 \u0627\u0644\u062c\u0646\u0627\u062d\u064a\u0646\u060c \u0644\u0627 \u064a\u0628\u0642\u0649 \u0633\u0648\u0649 \u0647\u0631\u0627\u0621 \u0648\u0644\u0627 \u062a\u0633\u062a\u0637\u064a\u0639 \u0627\u0646 \u062a\u0647\u0631\u0628 \u0645\u0646\u0647 \u0623\u0648 \u062a\u0641\u0631\u060c \u0643\u0623\u0646\u0645\u0627 \u0648\u0636\u0639\u062a \u0641\u064a \u0645\u0633\u062a\u0634\u0641\u0649 \u0627\u0644\u0645\u062c\u0627\u0646\u064a\u0646 \u0623\u0648 \u0641\u064a \u0627\u0644\u0633\u062c\u0646.","The leaves did not stir on the trees, cicadas twanged, and the monotonous muffled sound of the sea that rose from below spoke of the peace, the eternal sleep awaiting us.

In two or three hundred years life on earth will be unimaginably beautiful, amazing, astonishing.

Yalta was barely visible through the morning mist; white clouds rested motionlessly on the mountaintops. The leaves did not stir on the trees, cicadas twanged, and the monotonous muffled sound of the sea that rose from below spoke of the peace, the eternal sleep awaiting us. So it rumbled below when there was no Yalta, no Oreanda here; so it rumbles now, and it will rumble as indifferently and as hollowly when we are no more. And in this constancy, in this complete indifference to the life and death of each of us, there lies, perhaps, a pledge of our eternal salvation, of the unceasing advance of life upon earth, of unceasing movement towards perfection.","NINA: ...what\'s important is...the ability to endure. To be able to bear one\'s cross and have faith. I have faith, and it\'s not so painful now, and when I think of my vocation, I\'m not afraid of life.","And the existence is tedious, anyway; it is a senseless, dirty business, this life.","April was just beginning, and after the warm spring day it turned cooler, slightly frosty, and a breath of spring could be felt in the soft, cold air. The road from the convent to town was sandy, they had to go at a walking pace; and on both sides of the carriage, in the bright, still moonlight, pilgrims trudged over the sand. And everyone was silent, deep in thought, everything around was welcoming, young, so near\u2014 the trees, the sky, even the moon\u2014and one wanted to think it would always be so.","There sprang up between them the light jesting conversation of people who are free and satisfied, to whom it does not matter where they go or what they talk about.","Life\u2019s all done, just as if I never even lived it ...","If Iona\'s heart were to burst and his misery to flow out, it would flood the whole world, it seems, but yet it is not seen.

Reality irritated him, frightened him, kept him in continual agitation, and, perhaps to justify his timidity, his aversion for the actual, he always praised the past and what had never existed; and even the classical languages which he taught were in reality for him goloshes and umbrellas in which he sheltered himself from real life.","Happiness does not exist, nor should it, and if there is any meaning or purpose in life, they are not in our peddling little happiness, but in something reasonable and grand. Do good!","The proudest, the most independent of women, if I can but succeed in communicating my passion to her, will follow me unreasoningly, unquestioningly, doing all I desire. Out of a nun I once made a nihilist who, I heard later, shot a policeman.

She knew that Gorny (an army officer) and Gruzdyov (a student) were both in love with her, but now, after the opera, she wanted to doubt their love. To be unloved and miserable: what an attractive idea! There was something beautiful, touching and romantic about A loving B when B wasn\'t interested in A. Onegin was attractive in not loving at all, while Tatyana was enchanting because she loved greatly. Had they loved equally and been happy they might have seemed boring.(\\"After The Theatre\\")","In my opinion it is not the writer\'s job to solve such problems as God, pessimism, etc; his job is merely to record who, under what conditions, said or thought what about God or pessimism. The artist is not meant to be a judge of his characters and what they say; his only job is to be an impartial witness. I heard two Russians in a muddled conversation about pessimism, a conversation that solved nothing; all I am bound to do is reproduce that conversation exactly as I heard it. Drawing conclusions is up to the jury, that is, the readers. My only job is to be talented, that is, to know how to distinguish important testimony from unimportant, to place my characters in the proper light and speak their language.","\u0627\u0644\u0625\u0646\u0633\u0627\u0646 \u0647\u0648 \u062e\u0627\u0644\u0642 \u0633\u0639\u0627\u062f\u062a\u0647. \u0648\u0628\u0648\u0633\u0639\u0643\u0645\u060c\u0644\u0648 \u0623\u0631\u062f\u062a\u0645\u060c \u0623\u0646 \u062a\u0635\u0628\u062d\u0648\u0627 \u0633\u0639\u062f\u0627\u0621\u060c\u0648\u0644\u0643\u0646\u0643\u0645 \u0644\u0627 \u062a\u0631\u064a\u062f\u0648\u0646. \u0623\u0646\u062a\u0645 \u062a\u0647\u0631\u0628\u0648\u0646 \u0645\u0646 \u0627\u0644\u0633\u0639\u0627\u062f\u0629 \u0628\u0625\u0635\u0631\u0627\u0631!","\u0643\u0627\u0646\u062a \u0639\u0644\u0649 \u0627\u0644\u062f\u0648\u0627\u0645 \u062a\u064f\u062d\u0628 \u0623\u062d\u062f\u0627\u064b \u0645\u0627\u060c \u0648\u0644\u0627 \u062a\u0633\u062a\u0637\u064a\u0639 \u0623\u0646 \u062a\u0639\u064a\u0634 \u0645\u0646 \u062f\u0648\u0646 \u0630\u0644\u0643. \u0641\u064a \u0627\u0644\u0645\u0627\u0636\u064a \u0623\u062d\u0628\u062a \u0623\u0628\u0627\u0647\u0627 \u0627\u0644\u0630\u064a \u0623\u0635\u0628\u062d \u064a\u062c\u0644\u0633 \u0627\u0644\u0622\u0646 \u0645\u0631\u064a\u0636\u0627\u064b \u0641\u064a \u0645\u0642\u0639\u062f\u060c \u0641\u064a \u063a\u0631\u0641\u0629 \u0645\u064f\u0638\u0644\u0645\u0629\u060c \u0648\u064a\u062a\u0646\u0641\u0633 \u0628\u0635\u0639\u0648\u0628\u0629. \u0648\u0623\u062d\u0628\u062a \u062e\u0627\u0644\u062a\u0647\u0627 \u0627\u0644\u062a\u064a \u0643\u0627\u0646\u062a \u062a\u0623\u062a\u064a \u0645\u0646 \u0628\u0631\u064a\u0627\u0646\u0633\u0643 \u0623\u062d\u064a\u0627\u0646\u0627\u064b\u060c \u0645\u0631\u0629 \u0643\u0644 \u0639\u0627\u0645\u064a\u0646. \u0648\u0642\u0628\u0644 \u0630\u0644\u0643\u060c \u0639\u0646\u062f\u0645\u0627 \u0643\u0627\u0646\u062a \u062a\u062f\u0631\u0633 \u0641\u064a \u0627\u0644\u0645\u062f\u0631\u0633\u0629 \u0627\u0644\u0645\u062a\u0648\u0633\u0637\u0629\u060c \u0623\u062d\u0628\u062a \u0645\u062f\u0631\u0633 \u0627\u0644\u0644\u063a\u0629 \u0627\u0644\u0641\u0631\u0646\u0633\u064a\u0629. \u0643\u0627\u0646\u062a \u0622\u0646\u0633\u0629 \u0647\u0627\u062f\u0626\u0629\u060c \u0637\u064a\u0651\u0628\u0629 \u062d\u0646\u0648\u0646\u0627\u064b\u060c \u0628\u0646\u0638\u0631\u0629 \u0648\u062f\u064a\u0639\u0629 \u0646\u0627\u0639\u0645\u0629\u060c \u0648\u0641\u064a \u063a\u0627\u064a\u0629 \u0627\u0644\u0635\u062d\u0629. \u0648\u0639\u0646\u062f\u0645\u0627 \u064a\u0646\u0638\u0631 \u0627\u0644\u0631\u062c\u0627\u0644 \u0625\u0644\u0649 \u062e\u062f\u064a\u0651\u0647\u0627 \u0627\u0644\u0645\u0645\u062a\u0644\u0626\u064a\u0646 \u0627\u0644\u0645\u062a\u0648\u0631\u062f\u064a\u0651\u0646\u060c \u0648\u0625\u0644\u0649 \u0639\u0646\u0642\u0647\u0627 \u0627\u0644\u0623\u0628\u064a\u0636 \u0627\u0644\u0646\u0627\u0639\u0645 \u0630\u064a \u0627\u0644\u0634\u0627\u0645\u0629 \u0627\u0644\u062f\u0627\u0643\u0646\u0629\u060c \u0648\u0625\u0644\u0649 \u0627\u0628\u062a\u0633\u0627\u0645\u062a\u0647\u0627 \u0627\u0644\u0637\u064a\u0651\u0628\u0629 \u0627\u0644\u0633\u0627\u0630\u062c\u0629 \u0627\u0644\u062a\u064a \u062a\u0631\u062a\u0633\u0645 \u0639\u0644\u0649 \u0648\u062c\u0647\u0647\u0627 \u0639\u0646\u062f\u0645\u0627 \u062a\u0633\u0645\u0639 \u0634\u064a\u0626\u0627\u064b \u0633\u0627\u0631\u0651\u0627\u064e\u060c \u0643\u0627\u0646\u0648\u0627 \u064a\u0641\u0643\u0631\u0648\u0646: \\"\u0646\u0639\u0645\u060c \u0644\u0627 \u0628\u0623\u0633 \u0628\u0647\u0627..\\" \u0648\u064a\u0628\u062a\u0633\u0645\u0648\u0646 \u0647\u0645 \u0623\u064a\u0636\u0627\u064b\u060c \u0623\u0645\u0627 \u0627\u0644\u0646\u0633\u0627\u0621 \u0641\u0644\u0627 \u064a\u062a\u0645\u0627\u0644\u0643\u0646 \u0623\u0646\u0641\u0633\u0647\u0646 \u0641\u064a \u0623\u062b\u0646\u0627\u0621 \u0627\u0644\u062d\u062f\u064a\u062b \u0645\u0646 \u0627\u0644\u0625\u0645\u0633\u0627\u0643 \u0628\u064a\u062f\u0647\u0627 \u0648\u0627\u0644\u0642\u0648\u0644 \u0641\u064a \u063a\u0645\u0631\u0629 \u0627\u0644\u0633\u0631\u0648\u0631: \u064a\u0627 \u062d\u0628\u0651\u0648\u0628\u0629!","And the man who seeks salvation in change of place like a migrating bird would find nothing anywhere, for all the world is alike to him.","Brevity is the sister of talent.","In all nature there seemed to be a feeling of hopelessness and pain.

We see the people who go to market, eat by day, sleep by night, who babble nonsense, marry, grow old, good-naturedly drag their feet to the cemetery, but we do not see or hear those who suffer, and what is terrible in life goes on somewhere behind the scenes.

The ferry creaked and lurched. The silhouette of the peasant in the tall hat slowly began to recede from me--which meant that the ferry was moving. Soon Ieronym straightened up and began working with one hand. We were silent and looked at the bank towards which we were now moving. There the \\"lumination\\" which the peasant had been waiting for was already beginning. At the water\'s edge, barrels of pitch blazed like huge bonfires. Their reflection, crimson as the rising moon, crept to meet us in long, wide stripes. The burning barrels threw light on their own smoke and on the long human shadows that flitted about the fire; but further to the sides and behind them, where the velvet ringing rushed from, was the same impenetrable darkness. Suddenly slashing it open, the golden ribbon of a rocket soared skywards; it described an arc and, as if shattering against the sky, burst and came sifting down in sparks. On the bank a noise was heard resembling a distant \\"hoorah.\\"\\"How beautiful,\\" I said.\\"It\'s even impossible to say how beautiful!\\" sighed Ieronym. \\"It\'s that kind of night, sir!

But surely a corpse wants that, not a man. And I hear that our intellectuals have a longing for the land and want to acquire farms. But it all comes down to the six feet of land. To leave town, and the struggle and the swim of life, and go and hide yourself in a farmhouse is not life -- it is egoism, laziness; it is a kind of monasticism, but monasticism without action. A man needs, not six feet of land, not a farm, but the whole earth, all Nature, where in full liberty he can display all the properties and qualities of the free spirit.","There is something mystical in the proud man in the sense in which you use the words.

And what a powerful force they are! Just take a look at this life of ours and you will see the arrogance and idleness of the strong, the ignorance and bestiality of the weak. Everywhere there\'s unspeakable poverty, overcrowding, degeneracy, drunkenness, hypocrisy and stupid lies... And yet peace and quiet reign in every house and street. Out of fifty thousand people you won\'t find one who is prepared to shout out loud and make a strong protest. We see people buying food in the market, eating during the day, sleeping at night-time, talking nonsense, marrying, growing old and then contentedly carting their dead off to the cemetery. But we don\'t hear or see those who suffer: the real tragedies of life are enacted somewhere behind the scenes. Everything is calm and peaceful and the only protest comes from statistics - and they can\'t talk. Figures show that so many went mad, so many bottles of vodka were emptied, so many children died from malnutrition. And clearly this kind of system is what people need. It,s obvious that the happy man feels contented only because the unhappy ones bear their burden without saying a word: if it weren\'t for their silence, happiness would be quite impossible. It\'s a kind of mass hypnosis. Someone ought to stand with a hammer at the door of every contented man, continually banging on it to remind him that there are unhappy people around and that however happy he may be at that time, sooner or later life will show him its claws and disaster will overtake him in the form of illness, poverty, bereavement and there will be no one to hear or see him. But there isn\'t anyone holding a hammer, so our happy man goes his own sweet way and is only gently ruffled by life\'s trivial cares, as an aspen is ruffled by the breeze. All\'s well as far as he\'s concerned","Of course no one will consider, said Anisim, and he heaved a sigh. \u201cThere is no God, anyway, you know, mamma, so what considering can there be?\u201dVarvara looked at him with surprise, burst out laughing, and clasped her hands. Perhaps because she was so genuinely surprised at his words and looked at him as though he were a queer person, he was confused.\u201cPerhaps there is a God, only there is no faith. When I was being married I was not myself. Just as you may take an egg from under a hen and there is a chicken chirping in it, so my conscience was beginning to chirp in me, and while I was being married I thought all the time there was a God! But when I left the church it was nothing. And indeed, how can I tell whether there is a God or not? We are not taught right from childhood, and while the babe is still at his mother\u2019s breast he is only taught \u2018every man to his own job.\u2019 Father does not believe in God, either.

I realized that when you love someone, your reasoning about that love should be based on what is supreme, on what is more important than happiness or unhappiness, sin or virtue, in the way that they are usually understood, otherwise it is not worth reasoning at all.","One is shy of asking men under sentence what they have been sentenced for; and in the same way it is awkward to ask very rich people what they want so much money for, why they make such a poor use of their wealth, why they don\'t give it up, even when they see in it their unhappiness; and if they begin a conversation about it themselves, it is usually embarrassing, awkward, and long.","Within a year Ivan Dmitritch was completely forgotten in the town, and his books, heaped up by his landlady in a sledge in the shed, were pulled to pieces by boys.","I could not understand what these sixty-five thousand people lived for, what they read the gospel for, why they prayed, why they read books and magazines. What good had they gained from all that had been said and written hitherto if they were still possessed by the same spiritual darkness and hatred of liberty, as they were a hundred and three hundred years ago? So these sixty-five thousand people have been reading and hearing of truth, of justice, of mercy, of freedom for generations, and yet from morning till night, till the day of their death, they are lying, and tormenting each other, and they fear liberty and hate it as a deadly foe.","Two days before we were \\"banished\\" from the town my father came to see me. He sat down and in a leisurely way, without looking at me, wiped his red face, then took out of his pocket our town Messenger, and deliberately, with emphasis on each word, read out the news that the son of the branch manager of the State Bank, a young man of my age, had been appointed head of a Department in the Exchequer.\\"And now look at you,\\" he said, folding up the newspaper, \\"a beggar, in rags, good for nothing!

But there is no man with a hammer; the happy man lives at his ease, and trivial daily cares faintly agitate him like the wind in the aspen-tree\u2014and all goes well.","How fortunate Buddha, Mahomed, and Shakespeare were that their kind relations and doctors did not cure them of their ecstasy and their inspiration,\\" said Kovrin. \\"If Mahomed had taken bromide for his nerves, had worked only two hours out of the twenty-four, and had drunk milk, that remarkable man would have left no more trace after him than his dog. Doctors and kind relations will succeed in stupefying mankind, in making mediocrity pass for genius and in bringing civilisation to ruin.","a guitar. A hammock is swung near the table. It is three o\'clock in the afternoon of a cloudy day. MARINA, a quiet, grey-haired, little old woman, is sitting at the table knitting a stocking. ASTROFF is walking up and down near her. MARINA. [Pouring some tea into a glass] Take a little tea, my son. ASTROFF. [Takes the glass from her unwillingly] Somehow, I don\'t seem to want any. MARINA. Then will you have a little vodka instead? ASTROFF. No, I don\'t drink vodka every day, and besides, it is too hot now. [A pause] Tell me, nurse, how long have we known each other? MARINA. [Thoughtfully] Let me see, how long is it? Lord\u2014help me to remember. You first came here, into our parts\u2014let me think\u2014when was it? Sonia\'s mother was still alive\u2014it was two winters before she died; that was eleven years ago\u2014[thoughtfully] perhaps more. ASTROFF. Have I changed much since then? MARINA. Oh, yes. You were handsome and young then, and now you are an old man and not handsome any more. You drink, too. ASTROFF. Yes, ten years have made me another man. And why? Because I am overworked. Nurse, I am on my feet from dawn till dusk. I know no rest; at night I tremble under my blankets for fear of being dragged out to visit some one who is sick; I have toiled without repose or a day\'s freedom since I have known you; could I help growing old? And then, existence is tedious, anyway; it is a senseless, dirty business, this life, and goes heavily. Every one about here is silly, and after living with them for two or three years one grows silly oneself. It is inevitable. [Twisting his moustache] See what a long moustache I have grown. A foolish, long moustache. Yes, I am as silly as the rest, nurse, but not as stupid; no, I have not grown stupid. Thank God, my brain is not addled yet, though my feelings have grown numb. I ask nothing, I need nothing, I love no one, unless it is yourself alone. [He kisses her head] I had a nurse just like you when I was a child. MARINA. Don\'t you want a bite of something to eat? ASTROFF. No. During the third week of Lent I went to the epidemic at Malitskoi. It was eruptive typhoid. The peasants were all lying side by side in their huts, and the calves and pigs were running about the floor among the sick. Such dirt there was, and smoke! Unspeakable! I slaved among those people all day, not a crumb passed my lips, but when I got home there was still no rest for me; a switchman was carried in from the railroad; I laid him on the operating table and he went and died in my arms under chloroform, and then my feelings that should have been deadened awoke","Oh, I am unhappy\u2026 I can\'t work, I shan\'t work.

On the threshold stood the master himself, Alyokhin, a man of about forty, tall, stout, with long hair, and he looked more like a professor or an artist than a landowner. He wore a white shirt that hadn\'t been washed for a very long time, and it was tied round with a piece of rope as a belt. Instead of trousers he was wearing underpants; mud and straw clung to his boots. His nose and eyes were black with dust. He immediately recognised Ivan Ivanych and Burkin, and was clearly delighted to see them.\'Please come into the house, gentlemen,\' he said, smiling, \'I\'ll be with you in a jiffy.\'It was a large house, with two storeys. Alyokhin lived on the ground floor in the two rooms with vaulted ceilings and small windows where his estate managers used to live. They were simply furnished and smelled of rye bread, cheap vodka and harness. He seldom used the main rooms upstairs, reserving them for guests. Ivan Ivanych and Burkin were welcomed by the maid, who was such a beautiful young woman that they both stopped and stared at each other.\'You can\'t imagine how glad I am to see you, gentlemen,\' Alyokhin said as he followed them into the hall. \'A real surprise!\' Then he turned to the maid and said, \'Pelageya, bring some dry clothes for the gentlemen. I suppose I\'d better change too. But I must have a wash first, or you\'ll think I haven\'t had one since spring. Would you like to come to the bathing-hut while they get things ready in the house?\'The beautiful Pelageya, who had such a dainty look and a gentle face, brought soap and towels, and Alyokhin went off with his guests to the bathing-hut.\'Yes, it\'s ages since I had a good wash,\' he said as he undressed. \'As you can see, it\'s a nice hut. My father built it, but I never find time these days for a swim.\'He sat on one of the steps and smothered his long hair and neck with soap; the water turned brown.\'Yes, I must confess...\' Ivan Ivanych murmered, with a meaningful look at his head.\'Haven\'t had a wash for ages,\' Alyokhin repeated in his embarrassment and soaped himself again; the water turned a dark inky blue.","Strange indecision!","a rapid, skilful, and habitual movement he slapped me twice in the face.","Your insincerity is natural and in the order of things.

He was just at that stage which old match-making women mean when they speak of \\"a man in the prime of his age,\\" that is, he was neither young nor old, was fond of good fare, good liquor, and praising the past, panted a little as he walked, snored loudly when he was asleep, and in his manner with those surrounding him displayed that calm imperturbable good humour which is always acquired by decent people by the time they have reached the grade of a staff officer and begun to grow stout. His hair and beard were far from being grey, but already, with a condescension of which he was unconscious, he addressed young men as \\"my dear boy\\" and felt himself entitled to lecture them good-humouredly about their way of thinking. His movements and his voice were calm, smooth, and self-confident, as they are in a man who is thoroughly well aware that he has got his feet firmly planted on the right road, that he has definite work, a secure living, a settled outlook. . . .

The life cycle! But what cowardice to comfort oneself with this surrogate of immortality! The unconscious processes that occur in nature are even lower than human stupidity, for in stupidity there is still consciousness and will, while in these processes there is nothing. Only a coward whose fear of death is greater than his dignity can comfort himself with the thought that in time his body will live in grass, a stone, a toad... To see one\'s own immortality in the life cycle is as strange as to prophesy a brilliant future to the case after the costly violin has been broken and made useless.","\u2014 Ma bonne, pourquoi ai-je v\xe9cu jusqu\'\xe0 pr\xe9sent?

To begin with, it is somewhat obscure. A thousand years ago a monk, dressed in black, wandered about the desert, somewhere in Syria or Arabia. . . . Some miles from where he was, some fisherman saw another black monk, who was moving slowly over the surface of a lake. This second monk was a mirage. Now forget all the laws of optics, which the legend does not recognise, and listen to the rest. From that mirage there was cast another mirage, then from that other a third, so that the image of the black monk began to be repeated endlessly from one layer of the atmosphere to another. So that he was seen at one time in Africa, at another in Spain, then in Italy, then in the Far North. . . . Then he passed out of the atmosphere of the earth, and now he is wandering all over the universe, still never coming into conditions in which he might disappear. Possibly he may be seen now in Mars or in some star of the Southern Cross. But, my dear, the real point on which the whole legend hangs lies in the fact that, exactly a thousand years from the day when the monk walked in the desert, the mirage will return to the atmosphere of the earth again and will appear to men. And it seems that the thousand years is almost up . . . . According to the legend, we may look out for the black monk to-day or to-morrow.","instead of struggling they merely criticize, calling the world vulgar and forgetting that their criticism passes little by little into vulgarity.","And is it not ridiculous to think of justice when society greets all violence as a reasonable and expedient necessity, and any act of mercy\u2014an acquittal, for instance\u2014provokes a great outburst of dissatisfied, vengeful feeling?","\u064a\u0642\u0627\u0644 \u0625\u0646 \u0645\u0627 \u064a\u0628\u062f\u0648 \u0645\u062e\u064a\u0641\u0627 \u0647\u0648 \u0641\u0642\u0637 \u0645\u0627 \u0644\u064a\u0633 \u0645\u0641\u0647\u0648\u0645\u0627","Medicine is my lawful wife, and literature is my mistress.","It\u2019s much more honest to deceive a man than to break up his family life and injure his reputation.

In the Gospel, the words \u2018not of this world\u2019 are not used in that sense. To play with such words is indefensible. Our Lord Jesus Christ came to set up the Church upon earth. The Kingdom of Heaven, of course, is not of this world, but in Heaven; but it is only entered through the Church which has been founded and established upon earth. And so a frivolous play upon words in such a connection is unpardonable and improper.
