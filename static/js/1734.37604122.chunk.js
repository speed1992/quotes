They hated Russians. They hated Christians. Driven by ethnic hatred they tortured and slaughtered millions of Russians without a shred of human remorse. It cannot be overstated. Bolshevism committed the greatest human slaughter of all time. The fact that most of the world is ignorant and uncaring about this enormous crime is proof that the global media is in the hands of the perpetrators.","You can resolve to live your life with integrity. Let your credo be this: Let the lie come into the world, let it even triumph. But not through me.","If I were asked today to formulate as concisely as possible what was the main cause of the ruinous revolution that swallowed up some 60 million of our people, I could not put it more accurately than to repeat: \'Men had forgotten God; that is why all this has happened.\'","Such as it is, the press has become the greatest power within the Western World, more powerful than the legislature, the executive and judiciary. One would like to ask; by whom has it been elected and to whom is it responsible?","Modern society is hypnotized by socialism. It is prevented by socialism from seeing the mortal danger it is in. And one of the greatest dangers of all is that you have lost all sense of danger, you cannot even see where it\'s coming from as it moves swiftly towards you.","What would things been like [in Russia] if during periods of mass arrests people had not simply sat there, paling with terror at every bang on the downstairs door and at every step on the staircase, but understood they had nothing to lose and had boldly set up in the downstairs hall an ambush of half a dozen people?","To destroy a people, you must first sever their roots.","To do evil a human being must first of all believe that what he\'s doing is good... Ideology - that is what gives devildoing its long-sought justification and gives the evildoer the necessary steadfastness and determination. That is the social theory which helps to make his acts seem good instead of bad in his own and others\' eyes, so that he won\'t hear reproaches and curses but will receive praise and honors.","The strength or weakness of a society depends more on the level of its spiritual life than on its level of industrialization. Neither a market economy nor even general abundance constitutes the crowning achievement of human life. If a nation\'s spiritual energies have been exhausted, it will not be saved from collapse by the most perfect government structure or by any industrial development. A tree with a rotten core cannot stand.","It\'s an universal law-- intolerance is the first sign of an inadequate education. An ill-educated person behaves with arrogant impatience, whereas truly profound education breeds humility.","We hear a constant clamor for rights, rights, always rights, but so very little about responsibility. And we have forgotten God. The need now is for selflessness, for a spirit of sacrifice, for a willingness to put aside personal gains for the salvation of the whole Western world.","If only it were all so simple! If only there were evil people somewhere insidiously committing evil deeds, and it were necessary only to separate them from the rest of us and destroy them. But the line dividing good and evil cuts through the heart of every human being. And who is willing to destroy a piece of his own heart?","I hope that no one present will suspect me of offering my personal criticism of the Western system to present socialism as an alternative. Having experienced applied socialism in a country where the alternative has been realized, I certainly will not speak for it. The well-known Soviet mathematician Shafarevich, a member of the Soviet Academy of Science, has written a brilliant book under the title Socialism; it is a profound analysis showing that socialism of any type and shade leads to a total destruction of the human spirit and to a leveling of mankind into death.","Evil people always support each other; that is their chief strength.","A state of war only serves as an excuse for domestic tyranny.","The generation now coming out of Western schools is unable to distinguish good from bad. Even those words are unacceptable. This results in impaired thinking ability.","If I were called upon to identify briefly the principal trait of the entire 20th century... I would be unable to find anything more precise and pithy than to repeat once again: Men have forgotten God.","Unlimited power in the hands of limited people always leads to cruelty.","The solemn pledge to abstain from telling the truth was called socialist realism.","The price of cowardice will only be evil. We shall reap courage and victory only when we dare to make sacrifices.","In our country the lie has become not just a moral category but a pillar of the State.","In keeping silent about evil, in burying it so deep within us that no sign of it appears on the surface, we are implanting it, and it will rise up a thousandfold in the future. When we neither punish nor reproach evildoers . . . we are ripping the foundations of justice from beneath new generations.","Violence can only be concealed by a lie, and the lie can only be maintained by violence.","You only have power over people so long as you don\'t take everything away from them. But when you\'ve robbed a man of everything, he\'s no longer in your power - he\'s free again.","Human rights\' are a fine thing, but how can we make ourselves sure that our rights do not expand at the expense of the rights of others. A society with unlimited rights is incapable of standing to adversity. If we do not wish to be ruled by a coercive authority, then each of us must rein himself in...A stable society is achieved not by balancing opposing forces but by conscious self-limitation: by the principle that we are always duty-bound to defer to the sense of moral justice.","Socialism of any type leads to a total destruction of the human spirit...","We do not err because truth is difficult to see. It is visible at a glance. We err because this is more comfortable.","Lord, give me the strength to accomplish what You\'ve given me to do and the faith to trust You that what I haven\'t been able to accomplish You\'ve already assigned to someone else.","Human nature is full of riddles; . . . one of those riddles is: how is it that people who have been crushed by the sheer weight of slavery and cast to the bottom of the pit can nevertheless find strength in themselves to rise up and free themselves first in spirit and then in body while those who soar unhampered over the peaks of freedom suddenly lose the taste of freedom, lose the will to defend it, and, hopelessly confused and lost, almost begin to crave slavery?\'","The same old caveman feeling-greed, envy, violence, and mutual hate, which along the way assumed respectable pseudonyms like class struggle, racial struggle, mass struggle, labor-union struggle-are tearing our world to pieces.","The timid civilized world has found nothing with which to oppose the onslaught of a sudden revival of barefaced barbarity, other than concessions and smiles.","If we don\'t know our own history, then we simply will have to endure all of the same mistakes, all of the same sacrifices, all of the same absurdities over again - times ten.","Do not pursue what is illusory - property and position: all that is gained at the expense of your nerves decade after decade, and is confiscated in one fell night. Live with a steady superiority over life - don\'t be afraid of misfortune, and do not yearn after happiness; it is, after all, all the same: the bitter doesn\'t last forever, and the sweet never fills the cup to overflowing.","To reject this inhuman Communist ideology is simply to be a human being. Such a rejection is more than a political act. It is a protest of our souls against those who would have us forget the concepts of good and evil.","To coexist with communism on the same planet is impossible. Either it will spread, cancer-like, to destroy mankind, or else mankind will have to rid itself of communism (and even then face lengthy treatment for secondary tumors).","Bless you prison, bless you for being in my life. For there, lying upon the rotting prison straw, I came to realize that the object of life is not prosperity as we are made to believe, but the maturity of the human soul.","We didn\'t love freedom enough.","A decline in courage may be the most striking feature that an outside observer notices in the West today. The Western world has lost its civic courage . . . . Such a decline in courage is particularly noticeable among the ruling and intellectual elite, causing an impression of a loss of courage by the entire society.","Violence does not and cannot flourish by itself; it is inevitably intertwined with lying.","To do evil a human being must first of all believe that what he\'s doing is good.","We have to condemn the very idea that some people have the right to repress others.","At what point, then, should one resist? When one\'s belt is taken away? When one is ordered to face into a corner? When one crosses the threshold of one\'s home? An arrest consists of a series of incidental irrelevancies, of a multitude of things that do not matter, and there seems no point in arguing about one of them individually...and yet all these incidental irrelevancies taken together implacably constitute the arrest.","The name of \'reform\' simply covers what is latently a process of the theft of the national heritage.","European democracy was originally imbued with a sense of Christian responsibility and self-discipline, but these spiritual principles have been gradually losing their force. Spiritual independence is being pressured on all sides by the dictatorship of self-satisfied vulgarity, of the latest fads, and of group interests.","Morality is always higher than law and we cannot forget this ever.","Surrender one hair, and you\'ll end up beardless.","You\'re sincere, but in order not to upset your views you avoid talking with people who think differently. You pick your thoughts from conversations with people like yourself, from books written by people like yourself. In physics they call it resonance. You start out with modest opinions, but they match and build each other up to a scale.","We have to condemn publicly the very idea that some people have the right to repress others... When we neither punish nor reproach evildoers ... we are ripping the foundations of justice from beneath new generations.","If we live in a state of constant fear, can we remain human?","... that maxim of Descartes: \\"Question everything!\\" Question everything!","Woe to that nation whose literature is disturbed by the intervention of power. Because that is not just a violation against \\"freedom of print,\\" it is the closing down of the heart of the nation, a slashing to pieces of its memory.","There can be no acceptable future without an honest analysis of the past.","One drop of truth can outweigh an ocean of lies","Hastiness and superficiality are the psychic diseases of the 20th century, and more than anywhere else this disease is reflected in the press.","If you want to change the world, who do you begin with, yourself or others?  I believe if we begin with ourselves and do the things that we need to do and become the best person we can be, we have a much better chance of changing the world for the better.","During my time in the camps, I had got to know the enemies of the human race quite well: they respect the big fist and nothing else; the harder you slug them, the safer you will be.","Communism will never be halted by negotiations or through the machinations of detente. It can only be halted by force from without or by disintegration from within.","The less you speak, the more you will hear.","The Communists have for decades loudly proclaimed their goal of destroying the bourgeois world, while the West merely smiled at what seemed to be an extravagant joke.","Mistakes are a great educator when one is honest enough to admit them and willing to learn from them","Many of you have already found out, and others will find out in the course of their lives, that truth eludes us if we do not concentrate our attention totally on it\'s pursuit. But even while it eludes us, the illusion of knowing it still lingers and leads to many misunderstandings. Also, truth seldom is pleasant; it is almost invariably bitter.","Everything you add to the truth subtracts from the truth.","Let us not forget that violence does not live alone and is not capable of living alone: it is necessarily interwoven with falsehood. Between them lies the most intimate, the deepest of natural bonds. Violence finds its only refuge in falsehood, falsehood its only support in violence. Any man who has once acclaimed violence as his method must inexorably choose falsehood as his principle.","Own only what you can always carry with you: know languages, know countries, know people. Let your memory be your travel bag.","For us in Russia, communism is a dead dog, while, for many people in the West, it is still a living lion.","If we look far into the future, one can see a time in the 21st century when both Europe and the USA will be in dire need of Russia as an ally.","It is time in the West to defend not so much human rights as human obligations.","Without any censorship, in the West fashionable trends of thought and ideas are carefully separated from those which are not fashionable; nothing is forbidden, but what is not fashionable will hardly ever find its way into periodicals or books or be heard in colleges. Legally your researchers are free, but they are conditioned by the fashion of the day.","If decade after decade the truth cannot be told, each person\'s mind begins to roam irretrievably. One\'s fellow countrymen become harder to understand than Martians.","If... if... We didn\'t love freedom enough. And even more - we had no awareness of the real situation. We spent ourselves in one unrestrained outburst in 1917, and then we hurried to submit. We submitted with pleasure! ........... We purely and simply deserved everything that happened afterward.","On the way from the Renaissance to our days we have enriched our experience, but we have lost the concept of a Supreme Complete Entity which used to restrain our passions and our irresponsibility. We have placed too much hope in political and social reforms, only to find out that we were being deprived of our most precious possession: our spiritual life. In the East, it is destroyed by the dealings and machinations of the ruling party. In the West, commercial interests tend to suffocate it. This is the real crisis.","A decline in courage may be the most striking feature that an outside observer notices in the West today.","What is the most precious thing in the world? I see now that it is the knowledge that you have no part in injustice. Injustice is stronger than you, it always was and always will be, but let it not be done through you.","Education doesn\'t make you smarter.","Our envy of others devours us most of all.","The task of the artist is to sense more keenly than others the harmony of the world, the beauty and the outrage of what man has done to it, and poignantly to let people know.","A man is happy so long as he chooses to be happy and nothing can stop him.","It is the artist who realizes that there is a supreme force above him and works gladly away as a small apprentice under God\'s heaven.","Communist propaganda would sometimes include statements such as \\"we include almost all the commandments of the Gospel in our ideology\\". The difference is that the Gospel asks all this to be achieved through love, through self-limitation, but socialism only uses coercion. This is one point.","Someone that you have deprived of everything is no longer in your power. He is once again entirely free.","It is not because the truth is too difficult to see that we make mistakes... we make mistakes because the easiest and most comfortable course for us is to seek insight where it accords with our emotions - especially selfish ones.","Freedom! To fill people\'s mailboxes, eyes, ears and brains with commercial rubbish against their will, television programs that are impossible to watch with a sense of coherence. Freedom! To force information on people, taking no account of their right not to accept it or their right of peace of mind. Freedom! To spit in the eyes and souls of passersby with advertisements.","When you\'re cold, don\'t expect sympathy from someone who\'s warm.","... people don\'t know what they are striving for. They waste themselves in senseless thrashing around for the sake of a handful of goods and die without realizing their spiritual wealth.","Should one point out that from ancient times decline in courage has been considered the beginning of the end?","Vladimir Putin inherited a ransacked and bewildered country, with a poor and demoralized people. And he started to do what was possible - a slow and gradual restoration. These efforts were not noticed, nor appreciated, immediately. In any case, one is hard pressed to find examples in history when steps by one country to restore its strength were met favorably by other governments.","The battleline between good and evil runs through the heart of every man.","Any man who has once acclaimed violence as his method must inexorably choose falsehood as his principle.","A great disaster had befallen Russia: Men have forgotten God; that\'s why all this has happened.","Patriotism means unqualified and unwavering love for the nation, which implies not uncritical eagerness to serve, not support for unjust claims, but frank assessment of its vices and sins, and penitence for them.","I had grown up among engineers, and I could remember the engineers of the twenties very well indeed: their open, shining intellects, their free and gentle humor, their agility and breadth of thought, the ease with which they shifted from one engineering field to another, and, for that matter, from technology to social concerns and art. Then, too, they personified good manners and delicacy of taste; well-bred speech that flowed evenly and was free of uncultured words; one of them might play a musical instrument, another dabble in painting; and their faces always bore a spiritual imprint.","The simple act of an ordinary courageous man is not to take part, not to support lies! Let that come into the world and even reign over it, but not through me. Writers and artists can do more: they can vanquish lies! ... Lies can stand up against much in the world, but not against art.","Here again we witness the single outcome of a worldwide process, with East and West yielding the same results, and once again for the same reason: Men have forgotten God.","Truth seldom is pleasant; it is almost invariably bitter.","That which is called humanism, but what would be more correctly called irreligious anthropocentrism, cannot yield answers to the most essential questions of our life","Only those who decline to scramble up the career ladder are interesting as human beings. Nothing is more boring than a man with a career.","One cannot declare that only his faith is correct and all other faiths are not. God is endlessly multi-dimensional so every religion that exists on earth represents some face, some side of God. One must not have any negative attitude to any religion but nonetheless the depth of understanding God and the depth of applying God\'s commandments is different in different religions.","Beat a dog once and you only have to show him the whip.","It is a brave man who is the first to sit down during a standing ovation.","An engineer cannot participate in irrationality.","Ideology - that is what gives evildoing its long-sought justification and gives the evildoer the neccessary steadfastness and determination... Thanks to ideology, the twentieth century was fated to experience evildoing on a scale calculated in the millions.","I would rather have the United States as the world\'s policeman than the Soviet Union as the world\'s jailer.","Your friend will argue with you.","Justice is conscience, not a personal conscience but the conscience of the whole of humanity. Those who clearly recognize the voice of their own conscience usually recognize also the voice of justice.","To stand up for truth is nothing. For truth, you must sit in jail.","If you wanted to put the world to rights, who should you begin with: yourself or others?","Just as King Midas turned everything to gold, Stalin turned everything to mediocrity.","The line separating good and evil passes not through states, nor between classes, nor between political parties either - but right through every human heart - and through all human hearts. This line shifts. Inside us, it oscillates with the years. And even within hearts overwhelmed by evil, one small bridgehead of good is retained.","Happiness doesn\'t depend on the actual number of blessings we manage to scratch from life, only our attitude towards them.","I leaf through the ancient philosophers and find my newest discoveries there.","The meaning of earthly existence lies not, as we have grown used to thinking, in prospering, but in the development of the soul...","The one good thing about repeating your mistakes is that you know when to cringe","The next war... may well bury Western civilization forever.","It was only when I lay there on the rotting prison straw that I sensed within myself the first stirrings of good. Gradually it was disclosed to me that the line separating good and evil passes not between states nor between social classes nor between political parties, but right through every human heart, through all human hearts. And that is why I turn back to the years of my imprisonment and say, sometimes to the astonishment of those about me, bless you, prison, for having been a part of my life.","And keep as few things as possible, so that you don\'t have to fear for them. Give them up without a struggle-because otherwise the humiliation will poison your heart. They will take them away from you in a fight, and trying to hold onto your property will only leave you with a bloodied mouth ... But by owning things and trembling about their fate aren\'t you forfeiting the rare opportunity of observing and understanding?","There also exists another alliance - at first glance a strange one, a surprising one - but if you think about it, in fact, one which is well grounded and easy to understand. This is the alliance between our Communist leaders and your capitalists. This alliance is not new. ... We observe continuous and steady support by the businessmen of the West of the Soviet Communist leaders.","... any country that is not careful can be seized.","We are so attached to the earth, and yet we are incapable of holding onto it.","If one is forever cautious, can one remain a human being?","You know the words from the Bible: \'Build not on sand, but on rock....\' Tyrant leaders respect only firmness...and laugh at persons who give in to them.","When things are too clear, they are no longer interesting.","The \\"October Revolution\\" is a myth generated by the winners, the Bolsheviks, and swallowed whole by progressive circles in the West.","This deliberately nurtured hatred then spreads to all that is alive, to life itself, to the world with its colors, sounds, and shapes, to the human body. The embittered art of the twentieth century is perishing as a result of this ugly hate, for art is fruitless without love. In the East art has collapsed because it has been knocked down and trampled upon, but in the West the fall has been voluntary, a decline into a contrived and pretentious quest where the artist, instead of attempting to reveal the divine plan, tries to put himself in the place of God.","Was it Gorky who had said, \\"If your children are no better than you are, you have fathered them in vain, indeed you have lived in vain\\".","I am deeply convinced that God is present both in the lives of every person and also in the lives of entire nations.","Everyone is guilty of something or has something to conceal. All one has to do is look hard enough to find what it is.","With such global events looming over us like mountains, nay, like entire mountain ranges, it may seem incongruous and inappropriate to recall that the primary key to our being or non-being resides in each individual human heart, in the heart\u2019s preference for specific good or evil. Yet this remains true even today, and it is, in fact, the most reliable key we have. The social theories that promised so much have demonstrated their bankruptcy, leaving us at a dead end.","Nowhere on the planet, nowhere in history, was there a regime more vicious, more bloodthirsty, and at the same time more cunning than the Bolshevik, the self-styled Soviet regime.","A storm breaks trees. It only bends grass.","When we feel that we are not sufficiently respected, we should ask ourselves whether we are living as we should.","Satiety depends not at all on how much we eat, but on how we eat. It\'s the same with happiness, the very same...happiness doesn\'t depend on how many external blessings we have snatched from life. It depends only on our attitude toward them. There\'s a saying about it in the Taoist ethic: \'Whoever is capable of contentment will always be satisfied.","Not everything has a name. Some things lead us into a realm beyond words\u2026By means of art were are sometimes sent - dimly, briefly - revelations unattainable by reason.","It is within the power of writers and artists to do much more: to defeat the lie!","He who knows how to be content will be content with little.","The clock of communism has stopped striking. But its concrete building has not yet come crashing down. For that reason, instead of freeing ourselves, we must try to save ourselves from being crushed by its rubble.","One should never direct people towards happiness, because happiness too is an idol of the market-place. One should direct them towards mutual affection. A beast gnawing at its prey can be happy too, but only human beings can feel affection for each other, and this is the highest achievement they can aspire to.","I dare hope that all the peoples who have lived through communism will understand that communism is to blame for the bitter pages of their history.","Pride grows in the human heart like lard on a pig.","Literature that is not the breath of contemporary society, that dares not transmit the pains and fears of that society . . . loses the confidence of its own people, and its published works are used as wastepaper instead of being read.","Every man always has handy a dozen glib little reasons why he is right not to sacrifice himself.","Woe to that nation whose literature is disturbed by the intervention of power. Because that is not just a violation against \\"freedom of print,\\" it is the closing down of the heart of the nation, a slashing to pieces of its memory. The nation ceases to be mindful of itself, it is deprived of its spiritual unity, and despite a supposedly common language, compatriots suddenly cease to understand one another.","It makes me happier, more secure, to think that I do not have to plan and manage everything for myself, that I am only a sword made sharp to smite the unclean forces, an enchanted sword to cleave and disperse them. Grant, O Lord, that I may not break as I strike! Let me not fall from Thy hand!","... the inexorable lesson of centuries: suffering must be borne; there is no way out.","A genius doesn\'t adjust his treatment of a theme to a tyrant\'s taste","Only the first swath cut by the scythe is difficult.","I insist on believing that beauty elevates human beings.","Even the most rational approach to ethics is defenseless if there isn\'t the will to do what is right.","A great writer is, so to speak, a secret government in his country","Society must cease to look upon \'progress\' as something desirable. \'Eternal Progress\' is a nonsensical myth. What must be implemented is not a \'steadily expanding economy\', but a zero growth economy, a stable economy. Economic growth is not only unnecessary but ruinous.","It\'s true that private enterprise is extremely flexible, But its only good within very narrow limits. If private enterprise isn\'t held in an iron grip it gives birth to people who are no better than beasts, those stock-exchange people with greedy appetites beyond restraint.","In our age, when technology is gaining control over life, when material well-being is considered the most important goal, when the influence of religion has been weakened everywhere in the world, a special responsibility lies upon the writer.","Man has set for himself the goal of conquering the world but in the processes loses his soul.","When you\'re young, you haven\'t the experience, when you\'re old you haven\'t the strength.","Truth must be told-and things must change! If words are not about real things and do not cause things to happen, what is the good of them?","We always pay dearly for chasing after what is cheap.","When one is already on the edge of the grave, why not resist?","How can you expect a man who\'s warm to understand one who\'s cold?","It\'s not the sea that drowns you-it\'s the puddle.","If you ever get twenty-five years for nothing, if you find yourself wearing four number patches on your clothes, holding your hands permanently behind your back, submitting to searches morning and evening, working until you are utterly exhausted, dragged into the cooler whenever someone denounces you, trodden deeper and deeper into the ground-from the hole you\'re in, the fine words of the great humanists will sound like the chatter of the well-fed and free.","Human nature is full of riddles and contradictions; its very complexity engenders art-and by art I mean the search for something more than simple linear formulations, flat solutions, oversimplified explanations.","Who has the skill to make a narrow, obstinate human being aware of others\' far-off grief and joy, to make him understand dimensions and delusions he himself has never lived through? Propaganda, coercion, and scientific proofs are powerless. But happily, in our world there is a way. It is art, and it is literature.","The heart senses who is friend and who is no friend.","You should rejoice that you\'re in prison. Here you have time to think about your soul.","I am a convinced and consistent critic of party-parliamentarism. I am for non-partisan elections of true people\'s representatives who are accountable to their regions and districts; and who in case of unsatisfactory work can be recalled. I do understand and respect the formation of groups on economical, cooperative, territorial, educational, professional and industrial principles, but I see nothing organic in political parties. Politically motivated ties can be unstable and quite often they have selfish ulterior motives.","For me faith is the foundation and support of one\'s life.","The belly is an ungrateful wretch, it never remembers past favors, it always wants more tomorrow.","It is not our level of prosperity that makes for happiness but the kinship of heart to heart and the way we look at the world. Both attitudes lie within our power, so that a man is happy so long as he chooses to be happy, and no one can stop him.","Own only what you can always carry with you: know languages, know countries, know people. Let your memory be your travel bag. Use your memory! Use your memory! It is those bitter seeds alone which might sprout and grow someday. Look around you - there are people around you. Maybe you will remember one of them all your life and later eat your heart out because you didn\'t make use of the opportunity to ask him questions. And the less you talk, the more you\'ll hear.","Talent is always conscious of its own abundance, and does not object to sharing.","One world, one mankind cannot exist in the face of six, four or even two scales of values: We shall be torn apart by this disparity of rhythm, this disparity of vibrations.","Freedom or prison--what\'s the difference? A man must develop unwavering will power subject only to his reason.","We should clearly understand that only the voluntary and conscientious acceptance by a people of its guilt can ensure the healing of a nation. Unremitting reproaches from outside are counterproductive.","Power is a poison well known for thousands of years. If only no one were ever to acquire material power over others! But to the human being who has faith in some force that holds dominion over all of us, and who is therefore conscious of his own limitations, power is not necessarily fatal. For those, however, who are unaware of any higher sphere, it is a deadly poison. For them there is no antidote.","People who are at ease with their consciences always look happy.","Sometimes I feel quite distinctly that what is inside me is not all of me. There is something else, sublime, quite indestructible, some tiny fragment of the Universal spirit.Don\'t you feel that?","And the over-all fact that you are a frail vessel full of errors.","Only an extraordinary person can turn opportunity into reality.","Whenever the tissue of life is woven of legalistic relationships, this creates an atmosphere of spiritual mediocrity that paralyzes a person\'s noblest impulses.","I have spent all my life under a Communist regime, and I will tell you that a society without any objective legal scale is a terrible one indeed. But a society with no other scale but the legal one is not quite worthy of man either.","Nowadays we don\'t think much of a man\'s love for an animal; we laugh at people who are attached to cats. But if we stop loving animals, aren\'t we bound to stop loving humans too?","Violence, less and less embarrassed by the limits imposed by centuries of lawfulness, is brazenly and victoriously striding across the whole world, unconcerned that its infertility has been demonstrated and proved many times in history. What is more, it is not simply crude power that triumphs abroad, but its exultant justification. The world is being inundated by the brazen conviction that power can do anything, justice nothing.","Literature transmits incontrovertible condensed experience... from generation to generation. In this way literature becomes the living memory of a nation.","Gradually it was disclosed to me that the line separating good and evil passes not through states, nor between classes, nor between political parties either - but right through every human heart...","Any man who has once proclaimed violence as his method is inevitably forced to take the lie as his principle.","My wish for you... is that your skeptic-eclectic brain be flooded with the light of truth.","Like a bicycle, like a wheel that, once rolling, is stable only so long as it keeps moving but falls when its momentum stops, so the game between a man and woman, once begun, can exist only so long as it progresses. If the forward movement today is no more than it was yesterday, the game is over.","A hard life improves the vision.","An opposition is necessary and desirable for the healthy development of any country. You can scarcely find anyone in opposition, except for the communists, just like in Yeltsin\'s times. It is regrettable that there is still no constructive, clear and large-scale opposition in Russia. The growth and development of an opposition, as well as the maturing of other democratic institutions, will take more time and experience.","Literature becomes the living memory of a nation.","The intellectual is not defined by professional group and type of occupation. Nor are good upbringing and a good family enough in themselves to produce an intellectual. An intellectual is a person whose interest in and preoccupation with the spiritual side of life are insistent and constant and not forced by external circumstances, even flying in the face of them. An intellectual is a person whose thought is nonimitative.","Religion itself cannot but be dynamic which is why \\"return\\" is an incorrect term. A return to the forms of religion which perhaps existed a couple of centuries ago is absolutely impossible. On the contrary, in order to combat modern materialistic mores, as religion must, to fight nihilism and egotism, religion must also develop, must be flexible in its forms, and it must have a correlation with the cultural forms of the epoch.","The one who doesn\'t pull his weight is not asked to pull, while the one who does, pulls for two.","Voting for impersonal parties and their programmes is a false substitute for the only true way to elect people\'s representatives: voting by an actual person for an actual candidate.","Mourn if you must, but don\'t stop fighting.","[He] understood the people in a new way...The people is not everyone who speaks our language, nor yet the elect marked by the fiery stamp of genius. Not by birth, not by the work of one\'s hands, not by the wings of education is one elected into the people. But by one\'s inner self. Everyone forges his inner self year after year. One must try to temper, to cut, to polish one\'s soul so as to become a human being. And thereby become a tiny particle of one\'s own people.","Call no day happy \'til it is done; call no man happy til he is dead.","There is no point asserting and reasserting what the heart cannot believe.","The sole substitute for an experience which we have not ourselves lived through is art and literature.","Shall I describe the happiness it gave me to go into the classroom and pick up the chalk? ... It seemed to me the supreme, heartbreaking happiness to enter a classroom carrying a register as that bell rang, and start a lesson with the mysterious air of one about to unfold wonders.","To do evil a human being must first of all believe that what he\'s doing is good, or else that it\'s a well-considered act in conformity with natural law. Fortunately, it is in the nature of the human being to seek a justification for his actions.","Human nature, if it changes at all, changes not much faster than the geological face of the earth.","A work of art contains its verification in itself: artificial, strained concepts do not withstand the test of being turned into images; they fall to pieces, turn out to be sickly and pale, convince no one. Works which draw on truth and present it to us in live and concentrated form grip us, compellingly involve us, and no one ever, not even ages hence, will come forth to refute them.","Our government declared that it is conducting some kind of great reforms. In reality, no real reforms were begun and no one at any point has declared a coherent programme.","Literature cannot develop between the categories \\"permitted\\"\u2014\\"not permitted\\"\u2014\\"this you can and that you can\'t.\\" Literature that is not the air of its contemporary society, that dares not warn in time against threatening moral and social dangers, such literature does not deserve the name of literature; it is only a facade. Such literature loses the confidence of its own people, and its published works are used as waste paper instead of being read. -Letter to the Fourth National Congress of Soviet Writers","If state, party and social policy will not be based on morality, then mankind has no future to speak of.","A drop in the ocean has no fear of a hurricane.","People can live through hardship, but from hard feelings they perish.","We particularly like people who value us highly.","One can build the Empire State Building, discipline the Prussian army, make a state hierarchy mightier than God, yet fail to overcome the unaccountable superiority of certain human beings.","... mutual lack of understanding carries the threat of imminent and violent destruction.","Work was like a stick. It had two ends. When you worked for the knowing you gave them quality; when you worked for a fool you simply gave him eyewash.","Anything too far out of tune with our attitude is lost, either in the ears themselves or somewhere beyond, but it is lost.","Each person has his special moment of life when he unfolded himself to the fullest, felt to the deepest, and expressed himself to the utmost, to himself and to others.","All classifications in this world lack sharp boundaries, and all transitions are gradual.","Surely people should eventually cease to be surprised at anything? And yet they continue to be.","Friends!

Our world is rent asunder by those same old cave-age emotions of greed, envy, lack of control, mutual hostility which have picked up in passing respectable pseudonyms like class struggle, radical conflict, struggle of the masses, trade-union disputes.","Good or evil-you cannot build your life apart from this distinction.","Not all of me shall die.","It was wrong to be too pragmatic, to judge people solely by results; it was more humane to judge by intentions.","We have been fortunate enough to live at a time when virtue, though it does not triumph, is nonetheless not always tormented by attack dogs.

Quite recently, the state-owned TV channel \'Russia\' aired a series based on Varlam Shalamov\'s works, showing the terrible, cruel truth about Stalin\'s camps. It was not watered down.","A fish does not campaign against fisheries-it only tries to slip through the mesh.","How quickly a zek (a prisoner) gets cheeky-or, putting it in literary language, how quickly a man\'s requirements grow.","When truth is discovered by someone else, it loses something of its attractiveness.","I refuse to see literature as amusement, as a game. I think that you ought not to approach literature without a moral responsibility for every word you write.","Not everything has a name. Some things lead us into a realm beyond words.","When I was young, the early death of my father cast a shadow over me - and I was afraid to die before all my literary plans came true. But between 30 and 40 years of age my attitude to death became quite calm and balanced. I feel it is a natural, but no means the final, milestone of one\'s existence.","Scientific research? Only when not at the cost of ethics-and first of all, those of the researchers themselves.","Oh, how hard it is to part with power! This one has to understand.","It is unthinkable in the twentieth century to fail to distinguish between what constitutes an abominable atrocity that must be prosecuted and what constitutes that \\"past\\" which \\"ought not to be stirred up.","Any fool can bomb a train, but just try sorting out the mess.","...skepticism can never provide firm ground under a man\'s feet.

And I have always devoted myself gladly to work - to work and to the struggle.","If we could all take a sober look at our history, then we would no longer see this nostalgic attitude to the Soviet past that predominates among the less affected part of our society.","When Russia started to regain some of its strength as an economy and as a state, the West\'s reaction - perhaps a subconscious one, based on erstwhile fears - was panic.","Let us drive away those cruel, greedy oppressors, governments, and the new ones, having just laid aside grenades and rifles, will be just and understanding. Far from it.","The most intense patriotism always flourishes in the rear.","Too much art was no art at all. Like candy instead of bread!","Human beings yield in many situations, even important and spiritual and central ones, as long as it prolongs one\'s well-being.","As the old proverb says: \\"Well-fed horses don\'t rampage.","Even the most broad-minded of us can embrace only that part of truth into which our own snout has blundered.","For a country to have a great writer is like having a second government. That is why no regime has ever loved great writers, only minor ones.","No one can bar the road to truth, and to advance its cause I am prepared to accept even death.","Macbeth\'s self-justifications were feeble - and his conscience devoured him. Yes, even Iago was a little lamb too. The imagination and the spiritual strength of Shakespeare\'s evildoers stopped short at a dozen corpses. Because they had no ideology.","Let your memory be your travel bag.","A strong man never loses his head in defeat or despondency.","We are all human, and our senses are quicker to prompt us than our reason. Every man gives off a scent, and that scent tells you how to act before your head does.","Boris Yeltsin\'s period was characterized by a no less irresponsible attitude to people\'s lives, but in other ways. In his haste to have private rather than state ownership as quickly as possible, Yeltsin started a mass, multi-billion-dollar fire sale of the national patrimony. Wanting to gain the support of regional leaders, Yeltsin called directly for separatism and passed laws that encouraged and empowered the collapse of the Russian state. This deprived Russia of its historical role for which it had worked so hard, and lowered its standing in the international community.","In all probability an outburst of desperation in the midst of general submissiveness will always help.","The line dividing good and evil cuts through the heart of every human being. And who is willing to destroy a piece of his own heart?","When I was in the gulag I would sometimes even write on stone walls.

There were three thousand six hundred and fifty-three days like that in his stretch. From the first clang of the rail to the last clang of the rail. Three thousand six hundred and fifty-three days. The three extra days were for leap years.","I think the gap between the rich and the poor is a dangerous phenomenon in Russia and it needs the attention of the state. The only reasonable way to correct the situation today is not to go after big businesses, but to give breathing room to medium and small businesses. That means protecting citizens and small entrepreneurs from arbitrary rule and from corruption. It means investing the revenues from the national natural resources into the national infrastructure, education and health care. And we must learn to do so without shameful theft and embezzlement.","I will tell you something else: it is a major responsibility not only of portraiture but of all human communication for each of us to help everyone else discover the best that is in him.","I dedicate this to all those who did not live to tell it.

There was short weight in every ration. The only point was how short. So every day you took a look to soothe your soul - today, maybe, they haven\'t snitched any.","... but it is human to be outraged by injustice, even to the point of courting destruction!","The perception of the West as mostly a \\"knight of democracy\\" has been replaced with the disappointed belief that pragmatism, often cynical and selfish, lies at the core of Western policies. For many Russians it was a grave disillusion, a crushing of ideals.","The one and only substitute for experience which we have not ourselves had is art, literature. We have been given a miraculous faculty: Despite the differences of language, customs and social structure we are able to communicate life experience from one whole nation to another, to communicate a difficult national experience many decades long which the second of the two has never experienced.","One word of truth outweighs the whole world.","Art thaws even the frozen, darkened soul, opening it to lofty spiritual experience.","I am of course confident that I will fulfill my tasks as a writer in all circumstances - from my grave even more successfully and more irrefutably than in my lifetime.","What a force is laughter.","The salvation of mankind lies only in making everything the concern of all.","For a country to have a great writer is to have another government.","In our village, folks say God crumbles up the old moon into stars.","Thus, literature, together with language, preserves and protects a nation\'s soul.","We have arrived at an intellectual chaos.","Bless you, prison, for having been in my life!","In our country they do not permit any information to be X-rayed through and through, nor any discussion to encompass all the facets of a subject. All this is invariably suppressed at the very beginning, so no ray of light should fall on the naked body of truth. And then all this is piled up in one formless heap covering many years, where it languishes for whole decades, until all interest and all means of sorting out the rusty blocks from all this trash are lost.","The fewer limitations the artist imposes on his work, the less chance he has for artistic success.","It is almost always impossible to evaluate at the time events which you have already experienced, and to understand their meaning with the guidance of their effects. All the more unpredictable and surprising to us will be the course of future events.","After all, man is a complicated being, why should he be explainable by logic?","It\'s quite enough to show a well-beaten dog the whip.","When the whole discussion of \\"developing a national idea\\" hastily began in post-Soviet Russia, I tried to pour cold water on it with the objection that, after all the devastating losses we had experienced, it would be quite sufficient to have just one task: the preservation of a dying people.","The secret is that when you\'ve been pitched head first into hell you just write about it","A leader should not be a man who arbitrarily imported his own ideas but the essential focal point for a group of people who trusted one another and worked for a common aim.","It is in the nature of the human being to seek a justification for his actions.","Once the fight is on-strike quickly and often.","As the fathers live, so the children play.","The essence of life will never be captured by even the greatest of formulas.","Cracks make caves collapse.","... some kind of clean, pure feeling does live within us, existing apart from all our convictions.","The term \\"national idea\\" is an unclear one. One might think of it as a widely shared understanding among a people as to the desired way of life in their country, an idea that holds sway over the population. A unifying concept like that can be useful, but should never be created artificially or imposed top-down by the powers-that-be.","Blow the dust off the clock. Your watches are behind the times.

But I have always believed in what I did and never acted against my conscience.","I think the gap between rich and poor is an extremely dangerous phenomenon and needs the immediate attention of the state.","Religion always remains higher than everyday life. In order to make the elevation towards religion easier for people, religion must be able to alter its forms in relation to the consciousness of modern man.","What is an optimist? The man who says, \\"It\'s worse everywhere else. We\'re better off than the rest of the world. We\'ve been lucky.\\" He is happy with things as they are and he doesn\'t torment himself.

It was not governance but a thoughtless renunciation of power. The admiration of the West in return only strengthened his conviction that his approach was right. But let us be clear that it was Mikhail Gorbachev, and not Boris Yeltsin, as is now widely being claimed, who first gave freedom of speech and movement to the citizens of Russia.","One should not ascribe the evil deeds of individual leaders or political regimes to an innate fault of the Russian people and their country.","But what can you say in a letter?","I have always insisted on the need for local self-government for Russia, but I never opposed this model to Western democracy. On the contrary, I have tried to convince my fellow citizens by citing the examples of highly effective local self-government systems in Switzerland and New England, both of which I saw first-hand.","As for Europe, its claims towards Russia are fairly transparently based on fears about energy, unjustified fears at that.","Some are bound to die young.

Admittedly, this was caused not so much by real knowledge or a conscious choice, but by the natural disgust with the Bolshevik regime and its anti-Western propaganda.","To preserve his life, should a man pay everything that gives it color, scent and excitement?","I can say without affectation that I belong to the Russian convict world no less than I do to Russian literature. I got my education there, and it will last forever.","The central government possesses no plan of finding the way out of this blind alley.","First would be the literary side, then the spiritual and philosophical.

We brush aside all scales not our own, as if they were follies or delusions.","If someone asked you, why not help him out?","In the camp, this meant committing my verse-many thousands of lines-to memory. To help me with this I improvised decimal counting beads and, in transit prisons, broke up matchsticks and used the fragments as tallies. As I approached the end of my sentences I grew more confident of my powers of memory, and began writing down and memorizing prose-dialogue at first, but then, bit by bit, whole densely written passages. My memory found room for them! It worked. But more and more of my time-in the end as much as one week every month-went into the regular repetition of all I had memorized.","Generosity is a two-edged virtue for an artist - it nourishes his imagination but has a fatal effect on his routine.","I am of course confident that I will fulfill my tasks as a writer in all circumstances - from my grave even more successfully and more irrefutably than in my lifetime. No one can bar the road to truth, and to advance its cause I am prepared to accept even death. But may it be that repeated lessons will finally teach us not to stop the writer\'s pen during his lifetime? At no time has this ennobled our history.","Thus it is that no cruelty whatsoever passes by without impact. Thus it is that we always pay dearly for chasing after what is cheap.","Gradually it was disclosed to me that the line separating good and evil passes not through states, nor between classes, nor between political parties either -- but right through every human heart -- and through all human hearts. This line shifts. Inside us, it oscillates with the years. And even within hearts overwhelmed by evil, one small bridgehead of good is retained. And even in the best of all hearts, there remains ... an unuprooted small corner of evil. Since then I have come to understand the truth of all the religions of the world: They struggle with the evil inside a human being (inside every human being). It is impossible to expel evil from the world in its entirety, but it is possible to constrict it within each person.","In keeping silent about evil, in burying it so deep within us that no sign of it appears on the surface, we are implanting it, and it will rise up a thousand fold in the future. When we neither punish nor reproach evildoers, we are not simply protecting their trivial old age, we are thereby ripping the foundations of justice from beneath new generations.","You only have power over people as long as you don\'t take everything away from them.

If you want, I\'ll spell it out for you right now. Do not pursue what is illusionary -property and position: all that is gained at the expense of your nerves decade after decade, and is confiscated in one fell night. Live with a steady superiority over life -don\'t be afraid of misfortune, and do not yearn for happiness; it is, after all, all the same: the bitter doesn\'t last forever, and the sweet never fills the cup to overflowing. It is enough if you don\'t freeze in the cold and if thirst and hunger don\'t claw at your insides. If your back isn\'t broken, if your feet can walk, if both arms can bend, if both eyes can see, if both ears hear, then whom should you envy? And why? Our envy of others devours us most of all. Rub your eyes and purify your heart -and prize above all else in the world those who love you and who wish you well. Do not hurt them or scold them, and never part from any of them in anger; after all, you simply do not know: it may be your last act before your arrest, and that will be how you are imprinted on their memory.","The meaning of earthly existence lies not, as we have grown used to thinking, in prospering but in the development of the soul.","Human beings are born with different capacities. If they are free, they are not equal. And if they are equal, they are not free.","And how we burned in the camps later, thinking: What would things have been like if every Security operative, when he went out at night to make an arrest, had been uncertain whether he would return alive and had to say good-bye to his family? Or if, during periods of mass arrests, as for example in Leningrad, when they arrested a quarter of the entire city, people had not simply sat there in their lairs, paling with terror at every bang of the downstairs door and at every step on the staircase, but had understood they had nothing left to lose and had boldly set up in the downstairs hall an ambush of half a dozen people with axes, hammers, pokers, or whatever else was at hand?... The Organs would very quickly have suffered a shortage of officers and transport and, notwithstanding all of Stalin\'s thirst, the cursed machine would have ground to a halt! If...if...We didn\'t love freedom enough. And even more \u2013 we had no awareness of the real situation....

This line shifts. Inside us, it oscillates with the years. And even within hearts overwhelmed by evil, one small bridgehead of good is retained","The sole substitute for an experience we have not ourselves lived through is art and literature.","One day Dostoevsky threw out the enigmatic remark: \\"Beauty will save the world\\". What sort of a statement is that? For a long time I considered it mere words. How could that be possible? When in bloodthirsty history did beauty ever save anyone from anything? Ennobled, uplifted, yes - but whom has it saved?There is, however, a certain peculiarity in the essence of beauty, a peculiarity in the status of art: namely, the convincingness of a true work of art is completely irrefutable and it forces even an opposing heart to surrender. It is possible to compose an outwardly smooth and elegant political speech, a headstrong article, a social program, or a philosophical system on the basis of both a mistake and a lie. What is hidden, what distorted, will not immediately become obvious.Then a contradictory speech, article, program, a differently constructed philosophy rallies in opposition - and all just as elegant and smooth, and once again it works. Which is why such things are both trusted and mistrusted.In vain to reiterate what does not reach the heart.But a work of art bears within itself its own verification: conceptions which are devised or stretched do not stand being portrayed in images, they all come crashing down, appear sickly and pale, convince no one. But those works of art which have scooped up the truth and presented it to us as a living force - they take hold of us, compel us, and nobody ever, not even in ages to come, will appear to refute them.So perhaps that ancient trinity of Truth, Goodness and Beauty is not simply an empty, faded formula as we thought in the days of our self-confident, materialistic youth? If the tops of these three trees converge, as the scholars maintained, but the too blatant, too direct stems of Truth and Goodness are crushed, cut down, not allowed through - then perhaps the fantastic, unpredictable, unexpected stems of Beauty will push through and soar to that very same place, and in so doing will fulfil the work of all three?In that case Dostoevsky\'s remark, \\"Beauty will save the world\\", was not a careless phrase but a prophecy? After all he was granted to see much, a man of fantastic illumination.And in that case art, literature might really be able to help the world today?","Can a man who\'s warm understand one who\'s freezing?","Gradually it was disclosed to me that the line separating good and evil passes not through states, nor between classes, nor between political parties either -- but right through every human heart -- and through all human hearts. This line shifts. Inside us, it oscillates with the years.","If only there were evil people somewhere insidiously committing evil deeds, and it were necessary only to separate them from the rest of us and destroy them. But the line dividing good and evil cuts through the heart of every human being. And who is willing to destroy a piece of his own heart?During the life of any heart this line keeps changing place; sometimes it is squeezed one way by exuberant evil and sometimes it shifts to allow enough space for good to flourish. One and the same human being is, at various ages, under various circumstances, a totally different human being. At times he is close to being a devil, at times to sainthood. But his name doesn\'t change, and to that name we ascribe the whole lot, good and evil.Socrates taught us: \'Know thyself!","Do not pursue what is illusory - property and position: all that is gained at the expense of your nerves decade after decade and can be confiscated in one fell night.

But if I were asked today to formulate as concisely as possible the main cause of the ruinous revolution that swallowed up some 60 million of our people, I could not put it more accurately than to repeat: \\"Men have forgotten God; that\'s why all this has happened.","Hastiness and superficiality are the psychic diseases of the twentieth century.","Own only what you can always carry with you: know languages, know countries, know people.

And the less you talk, the more you\'ll hear.","Thus it is that we always pay dearly for chasing after what is\xa0cheap.","A great writer is, so to speak, a second government in his country. And for that reason no regime has ever loved great writers, only minor ones.","So in our own poor hides and from our miserable comrades we learn the nature of satiety. Satiety depends not at all on how much we eat, but on how we eat. It\'s the same with happiness, the very same...happiness doesn\'t depend on how many external blessings we have snatched from life. It depends only on our attitude toward them. There\'s a saying about it in the Taoist ethic: \'Whoever is capable of contentment will always be satisfied.","...you are strong only as long as you don\'t deprive people of everything.

That is the social theory which helps to make his acts seem good instead of bad in his own and others\' eyes, so that he won\'t hear reproaches and curses but will receive praise and honors. That was how the agents of the Inquisition fortified their wills: by invoking Christianity; the conquerors of foreign lands, by extolling the grandeur of their Motherland; the colonizers, by civilization; the Nazis, by race; and the Jacobins (early and late), by equality, brotherhood, and the happiness of future generations.... Without evildoers there would have been no Archipelago.","One man who stopped lying could bring down a tyranny.","Let us not forget that violence does not and cannot exist by itself; it is invariably intertwined with the lie. They are linked in the most intimate, most organic and profound fashion: violence cannot conceal itself behind anything except lies, and lies have nothing to maintain them save violence. Anyone who has once proclaimed violence as his method must inexorably choose the lie as his principle.","The line separating good and evil passes not through states, nor between classes, nor between political parties either \u2013 but right through every human heart\u2026even within hearts overwhelmed by evil, one small bridgehead of good is retained. And even in the best of all hearts, there remains\u2026an uprooted small corner of evil.Thanks to ideology the twentieth century was fated to experience evildoing calculated on a scale in the millions.Alas, all the evil of the twentieth century is possible everywhere on earth. Yet, I have not given up all hope that human beings and nations may be able, in spite of all, to learn from the experience of other people without having to go through it personally.","Literature cannot develop between the categories \\"permitted\\"\u2014\\"not permitted\\"\u2014\\"this you can and that you can\'t.\\" Literature that is not the air of its contemporary society, that dares not warn in time against threatening moral and social dangers, such literature does not deserve the name of literature; it is only a facade. Such literature loses the confidence of its own people, and its published works are used as waste paper instead of being read.-Letter to the Fourth National Congress of Soviet Writers","As the two-thousand-year-old saying goes, you can have eyes and still not see. But a hard life improves vision.","How can you expect a man who\'s warm to understand a man who\'s cold?","If humanism were right in declaring that man is born to be happy, he would not be born to die. Since his body is doomed to die, his task on earth evidently must be of a more spiritual nature. It cannot the unrestrained enjoyment of everyday life. It cannot be the search for the best ways to obtain material goods and then cheerfully get the most out of them. It has to be the fulfillment of a permanent, earnest duty so that one\'s life journey may become an experience of moral growth, so that one may leave life a better human being than one started it. It is imperative to review the table of widespread human values. Its present incorrectness is astounding. It is not possible that assessment of the President\'s performance be reduced to the question of how much money one makes or of unlimited availability of gasoline. Only voluntary, inspired self-restraint can raise man above the world stream of materialism.","And as soon as you have renounced that aim of \\"surviving at any price\\" and gone where the calm and simple people go\u2014then imprisonment begins to transform your former character in an astonishing way. To transform it in a direction most unexpected to you. And it would seem that in this situation feelings of malice, the disturbance of being oppressed, aimless hate, irritability, and nervousness ought to multiply. But you yourself do not notice how, with the impalpable flow of time, slavery nurtures in you the shoots of contradictory feelings. Once upon a time you were sharply intolerant. You were constantly in a rush. And you were constantly short of time. And now you have time with interest. You are surfeited with it, with its months and its years, behind you and ahead of you\u2014and a beneficial calming fluid pours through your blood vessels\u2014patience. You are acending...Formerly you never forgave anyone. You judged people without mercy. And you praised people with equal lack of moderation. And now an understanding mildness has become the basis of your uncategorical judgements. You have come to realize your own weakness\u2014and you can therefore understand the weakness of others. And be astonished at another\'s strength. And wish to possess it yourself. The stones rustle beneath our feet. We are ascending...With the year, armor-plated restraint covers your heart and all your skin. You do not hasten to question and you do not hasten to answer. Your tongue has lost its flexible capability for easy oscillation. Your eyes do not flash over with gladness over good tidings, nor do they darken with grief. For you still have to verify whether that\'s how it is going to be. And you also have to work out\u2014what is gladness and what is grief. And now the rule of your life is this: Do not rejoice when you have found, do not weep when you have lost.Your soul, which formerly was dry, now ripens with suffering. And even if you haven\'t come to love your neighbors in the Christian sense, you are at least learning to love those close to you.","What is an optimist? The man who says, \\"It\'s worse everywhere else. We\'re better off than the rest of the world. We\'ve been lucky.\\" He is happy with things as they are and he doesn\'t torment himself.What is a pessimist? The man who says, \\"Things are fine everywhere but here. Everyone else is better off than we are. We\'re the only ones who\'ve had a bad break.\\" He torments himself continually.","The meaning of existence was to preserve untarnished, undisturbed and undistorted the image of eternity which each person is born with - as far as possible. Like a silver moon in a calm, still pond.","It makes me happier, more secure, to think that I do not have to plan and manage everything for myself, that I am only a sword made sharp to smite the unclean forces, an enchanted sword to cleave and disperse them.Grant, O Lord, that I may not break as I strike! Let me not fall from Thy hand!","The line dividing good and evil cuts through the heart of every human being.","Our life consists not in the pursuit of material success but in the quest for worthy spiritual growth. Our entire earthly existence is but a transitional stage in the movement toward something higher, and we must not stumble and fall, nor must we linger fruitlessly on one rung of the ladder. Material laws alone do not explain our life or give it direction. The laws of physics and physiology will never reveal the indisputable manner in which the Creator constantly, day in and day out, participates in the life of each of us, unfailingly granting us the energy of existence; when this assistance leaves us, we die. And in the life of our entire planet, the Divine Spirit surely moves with no less force: this we must grasp in our dark and terrible hour.","Because instant and credible information has to be given, it becomes necessary to resort to guesswork, rumors and suppositions to fill in the voids, and none of them will ever be rectified, they will stay on in the readers\' memory. How many hasty, immature, superficial and misleading judgments are expressed every day, confusing readers, without any verification. The press can both simulate public opinion and miseducate it. Thus we may see terrorists heroized, or secret matters, pertaining to one\'s nation\'s defense, publicly revealed, or we may witness shameless intrusion on the privacy of well-known people under the slogan: \\"everyone is entitled to know everything.\\" But this is a false slogan, characteristic of a false era: people also have the right not to know, and it is a much more valuable one. The right not to have their divine souls stuffed with gossip, nonsense, vain talk. A person who works and leads a meaningful life does not need this excessive burdening flow of information.","The salvation of mankind lies only in making everything the concern of all","Look around you--there are people around you. Maybe you will remember one of them all your life and later eat your heart out because you didn\'t make use of the opportunity to ask him questions. And the less you talk, the more you\'ll hear. Thin strands of human lives stretch from island to island of the Archipelago. They intertwine, touch one another for one night only in just such a clickety-clacking half-dark car as this and then separate once and for all. Put your ear to their quiet humming and the steady clickety-clack beneath the car. After all, it is the spinning wheel of life that is clicking and clacking away there.","To do evil a human being must first of all believe that what he\'s doing is good, or else that it\'s a well-considered act in conformity with natural law. Fortunately, it is in the nature of the human being to seek a justification for his actions...Ideology\u2014that is what gives the evildoing its long-sought justification and gives the evildoer the necessary steadfastness and determination.","Live not by lies!","How do people get to this clandestine Archipelago? Hour by hour planes fly there, ships steer their course there, and trains thunder off to it--but all with nary a mark on them to tell of their destination. And at ticket windows or at travel bureaus for Soviet or foreign tourists the employees would be astounded if you were to ask for a ticket to go there. They know nothing and they\'ve never heard of the Archipelago as a whole or any one of its innumerable islands.Those who go to the Archipelago to administer it get there via the training schools of the Ministry of Internal Affairs.Those who go there to be guards are conscripted via the military conscription centers.And those who, like you and me, dear reader, go there to die, must get there solely and compulsorily via arrest.Arrest! Need it be said that it is a breaking point in your life, a bolt of lightning which has scored a direct hit on you? That it is an unassimilable spiritual earthquake not every person can cope with, as a result of which people often slip into insanity?The Universe has as many different centers as there are living beings in it. Each of us is a center of the Universe, and that Universe is shattered when they hiss at you: \\"You are under arrest.\\"If you are arrested, can anything else remain unshattered by this cataclysm?But the darkened mind is incapable of embracing these dis\xadplacements in our universe, and both the most sophisticated and the veriest simpleton among us, drawing on all life\'s experience,can gasp out only: \\"Me? What for?\\"And this is a question which, though repeated millions andmillions of times before, has yet to receive an answer.Arrest is an instantaneous, shattering thrust, expulsion, somer\xadsault from one state into another.We have been happily borne\u2014or perhaps have unhappilydragged our weary way\u2014down the long and crooked streets ofour lives, past all kinds of walls and fences made of rotting wood,rammed earth, brick, concrete, iron railings. We have never givena thought to what lies behind them. We have never tried to pene\xadtrate them with our vision or our understanding. But there iswhere the Gulag country begins, right next to us, two yards awayfrom us. In addition, we have failed to notice an enormous num\xadber of closely fitted, well-disguised doors and gates in thesefences. All those gates were prepared for us, every last one! Andall of a sudden the fateful gate swings quickly open, and fourwhite male hands, unaccustomed to physical labor but none\xadtheless strong and tenacious, grab us by the leg, arm, collar, cap,ear, and drag us in like a sack, and the gate behind us, the gate toour past life, is slammed shut once and for all.That\'s all there is to it! You are arrested!And you\'ll find nothing better to respond with than a lamblikebleat: \\"Me? What for?\\"That\'s what arrest is: it\'s a blinding flash and a blow whichshifts the present instantly into the past and the impossible intoomnipotent actuality.That\'s all. And neither for the first hour nor for the first daywill you be able to grasp anything else.","Freedom meant one thing to him\u2014home.But they wouldn\'t let him go home.","It was granted me to carry away from my prison years on my bent back, which nearly broke beneath its load, this essential experience; how a human being becomes evil and how good. In the intoxication of youthful successes I had felt myself to be infallible, and I was therefore cruel. In the surfeit of power I was a murderer, and an oppressor. In my most evil moments I was convinced that I was doing good, and I was well supplied with systematic arguments. And it was only when I lay there on rotting prison straw that I sensed within myself the first stirrings of good. Gradually it was disclosed to me that the line separating good and evil passes not through states, nor between classes, nor between political parties either\u2014but right through every human heart\u2014and through all human hearts. This line shifts. Inside us, it oscillates with the years. And even within hearts overwhelmed by evil, one small bridgehead of good is retained. And even in the best of all hearts, there remains\u2026 an unuprooted small corner of evil.","Or why should one refrain from burning hatred, whatever its basis--race, class, or ideology? Such hatred is in fact corroding many hearts today. Atheist teachers in the West are bringing up a younger generation in a spirit of hatred of their own society. Amid all the vituperation we forget that the defects of capitalism represent the basic flaws of human nature, allowed unlimited freedom together with the various human rights; we forget that under Communism (and Communism is breathing down the neck of all moderate forms of socialism, which are unstable) the identical flaws run riot in any person with the least degree of authority; while everyone else under that system does indeed attain \'equality\'--the equality of destitute slaves. This eager fanning of the flames of hatred is becoming the mark of today\'s free world. Indeed, the broader the personal freedoms are, the higher the level of prosperity or even of abundance--the more vehement, paradoxically, does this blind hatred become. The contemporary developed West thus demonstrates by its own example that human salvation can be found neither in the profusion of material goods nor in merely making money.","Human nature is full of riddles and contradictions; its very complexity engenders art\u2014and by art I mean the search for something more than simple linear formulations, flat solutions, oversimplified explanations. One of these riddles is: how is it that people who have been crushed by the sheer weight of slavery and cast to the bottom of the pit can nevertheless find strength to rise up and free themselves, first in spirit and then in body; while those who soar unhampered over the peaks of freedom suddenly appear to lose the taste for freedom, lose the will to defend it, and, hopelessly confused and lost, almost begin to crave slavery. Or again: why is it that societies which have been benumbed for half a century by lies they have been forced to swallow find within themselves a certain lucidity of heart and soul which enables them to see things in their true perspective and to perceive the real meaning of events; whereas societies with access to every kind of information suddenly plunge into lethargy, into a kind of mass blindness, a kind of voluntary self deception.","The end of an unclouded day. Almost a happy one. Just one of the 3,653 days of his sentence, from bell to bell.

But was Anna really unhappy? She chose passion and she paid for her passion\u2014that\'s happiness! She was a free, proud human being. But what if during peacetime a lot of greatcoats and peaked caps burst into the house where you were born and live, and ordered the whole family to leave house and town in twenty-four hours, with only what your feeble hands can carry?... You open your doors, call in the passers-by from the streets and ask them to buy things from you, or to throw you a few pennies to buy bread with... With ribbon in her hair, your daughter sits down at the piano for the last time to play Mozart. But she bursts into tears and runs away. So why should I read Anna Karenina again?

(There were a hundred thousand of them, I suppose. But did we pay much attention? What kind of wretched little ex-nobles were they, the ones who remained? Old people and children, the helpless ones.)

Suddenly the whole family was put down for deportation to Siberia. The children rushed to the Komsomol district office. \'Protect us!\' they said. \'Certainly we\'ll protect you,\' they were told. \'Just write on this piece of paper: As from today\'s date I ask not to be considered the son, or the daughter, of such-and-such parents. I renounce them as socially harmful elements and I promise in the future to have nothing whatever to do with them and to maintain no communication with them.","Thanks to ideology, the twentieth century was fated to experience evildoing on a scale calculated in the millions. This cannot be denied, nor passed over, nor surpressed. How, then, do we dare insist that evildoers do not exist? And whi was it that destroyed these millions? Without evildoers there would have been no Archipelago.There was a rumor going the rounds between 1918 and 1920 that the Petrograd Cheka, headed by Uritsky, and the Odessa Cheka, headed by Deich, did not shoot all those condemned to death but fed some of them alive to the animals in the city zoos. I do not know whether this is truth or calumny, or, if there were any such cases, how many were there. But I wouldn\'t set out to look for proof, either. Following the practice of the bluecaps, I would propose that they prove to us that this was impossible. How else could they get food for the zoos in those famine years? Take it away from the workibg class? Those enemies were going to die anyway, so why couldn\'t their deaths support the zoo economy of the Republic and thereby assist our march into the future? Wasn\'t it expedient?That is the precise line the Shakespearean evildoer could not cross. But the evildoer with ideology does cross it, and his eyes remain dry and clear.","Work is what horses die of. Everybody should know that.","No, the old proverb does not lie: Look for the brave in prison, and the stupid among the political leaders!","Relations between a man and a woman are always strange: nothing can be foreseen, they have no predictable direction, no law. Sometimes you come to a dead end, where there is nothing to do but sit down and weep; all the words have been said, and to no purpose; all the arguments have been thought of, and shattered. But then sometimes, at a chance look or word, the wall doesn\'t start to crack, but simply melts away. And where there was nothing but darkness, a clear path appears again, where two people can walk.Just a path \u2014 perhaps only for a minute.","Destructive and irresponsible freedom has been granted boundless space. Society appears to have little defense against the abyss of human decadence, such as, for example, misuse of liberty for moral violence against young people, motion pictures full of pornography, crime and horror. It is considered to be part of freedom and theoretically counter-balanced by the young people\'s right not to look or not to accept. Life organized legalistically has thus shown its inability to defend itself against the corrosion of evil.","It is here that we see the dawn of hope: for no matter how formidably Communism bristles with tanks and rockets, no matter what successes it attains in seizing the planet, it is doomed never to vanquish Christianity.","[He] understood the people in a new way...The people is not everyone who speaks our language, nor yet the elect marked by the fiery stamp of genius. Not by birth, not by the work of one\'s hands, not by the wings of education is one elected into the people.But by one\'s inner self.Everyone forges his inner self year after year.One must try to temper, to cut, to polish one\'s soul so as to become a human being. And thereby become a tiny particle of one\'s own people.","Work, he said, was a first-rate medicine for any illness.","If it were possible for any nation to fathom another people\'s bitter experience through a book, how much easier its future fate would become and how many calamities and mistakes it could avoid. But it is very difficult. There always is this fallacious belief: \'It would not be the same here; here such things are impossible.\'Alas, all the evil of the twentieth century is possible everywhere on earth.","It was Dostoevsky, once again, who drew from the French Revolution and its seeming hatred of the Church the lesson that \\"revolution must necessarily begin with atheism.\\" That is absolutely true. But the world had never before known a godlessness as organized, militarized, and tenaciously malevolent as that practiced by Marxism. Within the philosophical system of Marx and Lenin, and at the heart of their psychology, hatred of God is the principal driving force, more fundamental than all their political and economic pretensions. Militant atheism is not merely incidental or marginal to Communist policy; it is not a side effect, but the central pivot.","It is feasible and easy everywhere to undermine administrative power and, in fact, it has been drastically weakened in all Western countries. The defense of individual rights has reached such extremes as to make society as a whole defenseless against certain individuals. It is time, in the West, to defend not so much human rights as human obligations.","He ate his supper without bread. A double helping and bread--that was going too far. The bread would do for tomorrow. The belly is a demon.

Is it not mockery?","... skepticism can never provide firm ground under a man\'s feet. And perhaps, after all, we need firm ground.","The Elm LogBy Alexander SolzhenitsynWe were sawing firewood when we picked up an elm log and gave a cry of amazement. It was a full year since we had chopped down the trunk, dragged it along behind a tractor and sawn it up into logs, which we had then thrown on to barges and wagons, rolled into stacks and piled up on the ground - and yet this elm log had still not given up! A fresh green shoot had sprouted from it with a promise of a thick, leafy branch, or even a whole new elm tree.We placed the log on the sawing-horse, as though on an executioner\'s block, but we could not bring ourselves to bite into it with our saw. How could we? That log cherished life as dearly as we did; indeed, its urge to live was even stronger than ours.","A society which is based on the letter of the law and never reaches any higher is taking very scarce advantage of the high range of human possibilities.","Violence does not necessarily take people by the throat and strangle them. Usually it demands no more than an ultimate allegiance from its subjects. They are required merely to become accomplices in its lies.","In the realm of the unknown, difficulties must be viewed as a hidden treasure! Usually, the more difficult, the better. It\'s not as valuable if your difficulties stem from your own inner struggle. But when difficulties arise out of increasing objective resistance, that\'s marvelous!","By now we are even unsure whether we have the right to talk about the events of our own lives.","The communist regime in the East could stand and grow due to the enthusiastic support from an enormous number of Western intellectuals who felt a kinship and refused to see communism\'s crimes. When they no longer could do so, they tried to justify them.","The belly is a demon. It doesn\'t remember how well you treated it yesterday; it\'ll cry out for more tomorrow.","And how we burned in the camps later, thinking: What would things have been like if every security operative, when he went out at night to make an arrest, had been uncertain whether he would return alive and had to say good-bye to his family? Or if, during periods of mass arrests, as for example in Leningrad, when they arrested a quarter of the entire city, people had not simply sat there in their lairs, paling with terror at every bang of the downstairs door and at every step on the staircase, but had understood they had nothing left to lose and had boldly set up in the downstairs hall an ambush of half a dozen people with axes, hammers, pokers, or whatever else was at hand? After all, you knew ahead of time that those bluecaps were out at night for no good purpose. And you could be sure ahead of time that you\u2019d be cracking the skull of a cutthroat.","So let the reader who expects this book to be a political expos\xe9 slam its covers shut right now.If only it were all so simple! If only there were evil people somewhere insidiously committing evil deeds, and it were necessary only to separate them from the rest of us and destroy them. But the line dividing good and evil cuts through the heart of every human being. And who is willing to destroy a piece of his own heart?During the life of any heart this line keeps changing place; sometimes it is squeezed one way by exuberant evil and sometimes it shifts to allow enough space for good to flourish. One and the same human being is, at various ages, under various circumstances, a totally different human being. At times he is close to being a devil, at times to sainthood. But his name doesn\'t change, and to that name we ascribe the whole lot, good and evil.Socrates taught us: Know thyself!Confronted by the pit into which we are about to toss those who have done us harm, we halt, stricken dumb: it is after all only because of the way things worked out that they were the executioners and we weren\'t.","A tub was brought in to melt snow for mortar.

Seven years in the army and seven years in the camp,twice seven years twice that mythical or biblical term,then to be deprived of the ability to tell what is a man and what is a woman--is not a price extortionate?","It is a human characteristic, which has been richly exploited in every era, that while hope of survival is still alive in a man, while he still believes his troubles will have a favorable outcome, and while he still has the chance to unmask treason or to save someone else by sacrificing himself, he continues to cling to the pitiful remnants of comfort and remains silent and submissive. When he has been taken and destroyed, when he has nothing more to lose, and is, in consequence, ready and eager for heroic action, his belated rage can only spend itself against the stone walls of solitary confinement. Or the breath of the death sentence makes him indifferent to earthly affairs.","He\u2019s retired, he\u2019s just turned sixty, you know.

He\u2019d always wanted to be a beekeeper, and now bees are the only thing he\u2019ll take an interest in. How do these things happen, do you think? If you\u2019re really a beekeeper, how is it that you waste the best years of your life doing something else?","Let us put it generally: if a regime is immoral, its subjects are free from all obligations to it.","And even in the fever of epidemic arrests, when people leaving for work said farewell to their families every day, because they could not be certain they would return at night, even then almost no one tried to run away and only in rare cases did people commit suicide. And that was exactly what was required. A submissive sheep is a find for a wolf.","Fire, fire! The branches crackle and the night wind of late autumn blows the flame of the bonfire back and forth. The compound is dark; I am alone at the bonfire, and I can bring it still some more carpenters\' shavings. The compound here is a privileged one, so privileged that it is almost as if I were out in freedom -- this is an island of paradise; this is the Marfino \\"sharashka\\" -- a scientific institute staffed with prisoners -- in its most privileged period. No one is overseeing me, calling me to a cell, chasing me away from the bonfire, and even then it is chilly in the penetrating wind.  But she -- who has already been standing in the wind for hours, her arms straight down, her head drooping, weeping, then growing numb and still. And then again she begs piteously \\"Citizen Chief! Please forgive me! I won\'t do it again.\\" The wind carries her moan to me, just as if she were moaning next to my ear. The citizen chief at the gatehouse fires up his stove and does not answer.  This was the gatehouse of the camp next door to us, from which workers came into our compound to lay water pipes and to repair the old ramshackle seminary building.  Across from me, beyond the artfully intertwined, many-stranded barbed-wire barricade and two steps away from the gatehouse, beneath a bright lantern, stood the punished girl, head hanging, the wind tugging at her grey work skirt, her feet growing numb from the cold, a thin scarf over her head.  It had been warm during the day, when they had been digging a ditch on our territory. And another girl, slipping down into a ravine, had crawled her way to the Vladykino Highway and escaped.  The guard had bungled. And Moscow city buses ran right along the highway. When they caught on, it was too late to catch her. They raised the alarm.  A mean, dark major arrived and shouted that if they failed to catch the girl, the entire camp would be deprived of visits and parcels for whole month, because of her escape.  And the women brigadiers went into a rage, and they were all shouting, one of them in particular, who kept viciously rolling her eyes: \\"Oh, I hope they catch her, the bitch! I hope they take scissors and -- clip, clip, clip -- take off all her hair in front of the line-up!\\" But the girl who was now standing outside the gatehouse in the cold had sighed and said instead: \\"At least she can have a good time out in freedom for all of us!\\" The jailer had overheard what she said, and now she was being punished; everyone else had been taken off to the camp, but she had been set outside there to stand \\"at attention\\" in front of the gatehouse. This had been at 6 PM, and it was now 11 PM.  She tried to shift from one foot to another, but the guard stuck out his head and shouted: \\"Stand at attention, whore, or else it will be worse for you!\\" And now she was not moving, only weeping: \\"Forgive me, Citizen Chief! Let me into the camp, I won\'t do it any more!\\" But even in the camp no one was about to say to her: \\"All right, idiot! Come on it!\\" The reason they were keeping her out there so long was that the next day was Sunday, and she would not be needed for work.  Such a straw-blond, naive, uneducated slip of a girl! She had been imprisoned for some spool of thread. What a dangerous thought you expressed there, little sister! They want to teach you a lesson for the rest of your life!  Fire, fire! We fought the war -- and we looked into the bonfires to see what kind of victory it would be. The wind wafted a glowing husk from the bonfire. To that flame and to you, girl, I promise: the whole wide world will read about you.","Evidently, evildoing also has a threshold magnitude. Yes, a human being hesitates and bobs back and forth between good and evil all his life. He slips, falls back, clambers up, repents, things begin to darken again. But just so long as the threshold of evildoing is not crossed, the possibility of returning remains, and he himself is still within reach of our hope. But when, through the density of evil actions, the result either of their own extreme danger or of the absoluteness of his power, he suddenly crosses that threshold, he has left humanity behind, and without, perhaps, the possibility of return.","The harder life is for a man when he is young, the easier it will be in the future.","You don\'t have to be very bright to carry a handbarrow. So the squad leader gave such work to people who\'d been in positions of authority.","The great truth for Innokenty used to be that we are given only one life.Now, with the new feeling that had ripened in him, he became aware of another law: that we are given only one conscience, too.A life laid down cannot be reclaimed, nor can a ruined conscience.","What\'s worse than cancer? Leprosy.","By dying young, a man stays young forever in people\u2019s memory. If he burns brightly before he dies, his light shines for all time. In his musings during the past few weeks Vadim had discovered an important and at first glance paradoxical point: a man of talent can understand and accept death more easily than a man with none\u2014yet the former has more to lose. A man of no talent craves long life, yet Epicurus had once observed that a fool, if offered eternity, would not know what to do with it.","You can build the Empire State Building. Train the Prussian army. Elevate the hierarchy of a totalitarian state higher than the throne of the Most High.But there are still people whose moral superiority defeats your own.","The Rusanovs loved the People, their great People. They served the People and were ready to give their lives for the People. But as the years went by they found themselves less and less able to tolerate actual human beings, those obstinate creatures who were always resistant, refusing to do what they were told to and, besides, demanding something for themselves.","The days rolled by in the camp\u2014they were over before you could say \\"knife.\\" But the years, they never rolled by; they never moved by a second.","The Western world has lost its civil courage, both as a whole and separately, in each country, each government, each political party and of course in the United Nations. Such a decline in courage is particularly noticeable among the ruling groups and the intellectual elite, causing an impression of loss of courage by the entire society.","There is a law in the Archipelago that those who have been treated the most harshly and who have withstood the most bravely, who are the most honest, the most courageous, the most unbending, never again come out into the world. They are never again shown to the world because they will tell tales that the human mind can barely accept. Some of your returned POW\'s told you that they were tortured. This means that those who have remained were tortured ever more, but did not yield an inch. These are your best people. These are your foremost heroes, who, in a solitary combat, have stood the test. And today, unfortunately, they cannot take courage from our applause. They can\'t hear it from their solitary cells where they may either die or remain for thirty years like Raoul Wallenberg, the Swedish diplomat who was seized in 1945 in the Soviet Union. He has been imprisoned for thirty years and they will not give him up.","Live with a steady superiority over life-don\'t be afraid of misfortune, and do not yearn after happiness; it is, after all, all the same: the bitter doesn\'t last forever, and the sweet never fills the cup to overflowing. It is enough if you don\'t freeze in the cold and if thirst and hunger don\'t claw at your insides. If your back isn\'t broken, if your feet can walk, if both arms can bend, if both eyes can see, and if both ears can hear, then whom should you envy? And why? Our envy of others devours us most of all.","But it is impossible to picture any of our interrogators, right up to Abakumov and Beria, wanting to slip into prisoner\'s skin even for one hour, or feeling compelled to sit and meditate in solitary confinement. Their branch of service does not require them to be educated people of broad culture and broad views\u2014and they are not. Their branch of service does not require them to think logically\u2014and they do not. Their branch of service requires only that they carry out orders exactly and be impervious to suffering\u2014and that is what they do and what they are. We who have passed through their hands feel suffocated when we think of the legion, which is stripped bare of universal human ideals.","Men have forgotten God\\"Over a half century ago, while I was still a child, I recall hearing a number of old people offer the following explanation for the great disasters that had befallen Russia: \\"Men have forgotten God; that\'s why all this has happened.\\" Since then I have spent well-nigh 50 years working on the history of our revolution; in the process I have read hundreds of books, collected hundreds of personal testimonies, and have already contributed eight volumes of my own toward the effort of clearing away the rubble left by that upheaval. But if I were asked today to formulate as concisely as possible the main cause of the ruinous revolution that swallowed up some 60 million of our people, I could not put it more accurately than to repeat: \\"Men have forgotten God; that\'s why all this has happened.","When our life crackles and sparks like a torch, we curse the necessity of spending eight hours uselessly in sleep. When we have been deprived of everything, when we have been deprived of hope, then bless you, fourteen hours of sleep!","At the present time it is widely accepted among lawyers that law is higher than morality\u2014law is something which is shaped and developed, whereas morality is something inchoate and amorphous. This is not the case. The opposite is true: morality is higher than law! Law is our human attempt to embody in rules a part of that moral sphere which is above us. We try to understand this morality, bring it down to earth, and present it in the form of law. Sometimes we are more successful, sometimes less. Sometimes we have a mere caricature of morality, but morality is always higher than law. This view must never be abandoned.","The concept of maximum promotion of human rights to the expense of the majority of people in fact undermines the entire concept of the human community.","are there really people on this earth who deliberately set out to do evil things? Who say to themselves, I want to hurt people, to inflict all the pain I can, to make their lives impossible?","Was it only that explosion of atavism which is now evasively called \\"the cult of personality\\" that was so horrible? Or was it even more horrible that during those same years, in 1937 itself, we celebrated Pushkin\'s centennial? And that we shamelessly continued to stage those self-same Chekhov plays, even though the answers to them had already come in? Is it not still more dreadful that we are now being told, thirty years later, \\"Don\'t talk about it!\\"? If we start to recall the sufferings of millions, we are told it will distort the historical perspective! If we doggedly seek out the essence of our morality, we are told it will darken our material progress! Let\'s think rather about the blast furnaces, the rolling mills that were built, the canals that were dug... no, better not talk about the canals.... Then maybe about the gold of the Kolyma? No, maybe we ought not to talk about that either.... Well, we can talk about anything, so long as we do it adroitly, so long as we glorify it....","If you always look over your shoulder, how can you still remain human?","Sometimes the principal emotion of the person arrested is relief and even happiness! This is another aspect of human nature. It happened before the Revolution too: the Yekaterinodar schoolteacher Serdyukova, involved in the case of Aleksandr Ulyanov, felt only relief when she was arrested. But this feeling was a thousand times stronger during epidemics of arrests when all around you they were hauling in people like yourself and still had not come for you; for some reason they were taking their time. After all, that kind of exhaustion, that kind of suffering, is worse than any kind of arrest, and not only for a person of limited courage.","Three thousand six hundred and fifty-three days.The three extra days were for leap years.","How could it be anything but hard! It was more than the human heart could bear: to fall beneath the beloved ax -- then have to justify its wisdom.But that is the price a man pays for entrusting his God-given soul to human dogma.","But in the 17th century Russian Orthodoxy was gravely weakened by an internal schism. In the 18th, the country was shaken by Peter\'s forcibly imposed transformations, which favored the economy, the state, and the military at the expense of the religious spirit and national life. And along with this lopsided Petrine enlightenment, Russia felt the first whiff of secularism; its subtle poisons permeated the educated classes in the course of the 19th century and opened the path to Marxism. By the time of the Revolution, faith had virtually disappeared in Russian educated circles; and amongst the uneducated, its health was threatened.","One thing about women Yefrem had found out in his life: they cling.","Without even knowing it ourselves, we were ransomed by the small change in copper that was left from the golden coins our great-grandfathers had expended, at a time when morality was not considered relative and when the distinction between good and evil was very simply perceived by the heart.","It is astonishing that Communism has been writing about itself in the most open way, in black and white, for 125 years, and even more openly, more candidly in the beginning. The [book:Communist Manifesto|30474, for instance, which everyone knows by name and which almost no one takes the trouble to read, contains even more terrible things than what has actually been done. It is perfectly amazing. The whole world can read, everyone is literate, yet somehow no one wants to understand. Humanity acts as if it does not understand what Communism is, as if it does not want to understand, is not capable of understanding.","I had a chance to read","Own nothing! Possess nothing! Buddha and Christ taught us this, and the Stoics and the Cynics. Greedy though we are, why can\'t we seem to grasp that simple teaching? Can\'t we understand that with property we destroy our soul? So let the herring keep warm in your pocket until you get to the transit prison rather than beg for something to drink here. And did they give us a two-day supply of bread and sugar? In that case, eat it in one sitting. Then no one will steal it from you, and you won\'t have to worry about it. And you\'ll be free as a bird in heaven! Own only what you can always carry with you: know languages, know countries, know people. Let your memory be your travel bag. Use your memory! Use your memory! It is those bitter seeds alone which might sprout and grow someday. Look around you-there are people around you. Maybe you will remember one of them all your life and later eat your heartout because you didn\'t make use of the opportunity to ask him questions. And the less you talk, the more you\'ll hear. Thin strands of human lives stretch from island to island of the Archipelago. They intertwine, touch one another for one night only in just such a clickety-clacking half-dark car as this and then separate once and for all. Put your ear to their quiet humming and the steady clickety-clack beneath the car. After all, it is the spinning wheel of life that is clicking and clacking away there. What strange stories you can hear! What things you will laugh at!","The battle line between good and evil runs through the heart of every man.","The thoughts of a prisoner\u2014they\'re not free either. They kept returning to the same things. A single idea keeps stirring. Would they feel that piece of bread in the mattress? Would he have any luck in the dispensary that evening? Would they out Buinovsky in the cells? And how did Tsezar get his hands on that warm vest?","Dwell on the past and you\u2019ll lose an eye. But the proverb goes on to say: \u201cForget the past and you\u2019ll lose both eyes.\u201d","Communism has never concealed the fact that it rejects all absolute concepts of morality. It scoffs at any consideration of \\"good\\" and \\"evil\\" as indisputable categories. Communism considers morality to be relative, to be a class matter. Depending on circumstances and the political situation, any act, including murder, even the killing of hundreds of thousands, could be good or could be bad. It all depends on class ideology. And who defines this ideology? The whole class cannot get together to pass judgment. A handful of people determine what is good and what is bad. But I must say that in this respect Communism has been most successful. It has infected the whole world with the belief in the relativity of good and evil. Today, many people apart from the Communists are carried away by this idea.","in order to do evil, must first believe that what they are doing is good, otherwise they can\'t do it.","An evil man threw tobacco in the macaque-rhesus eyes.\' Oleg was struck dumb. Up to then he had been strolling along smiling with knowing condescension, but now he felt like yelling and roaring across the whole zoo, as though the tobacco had been thrown into his own eyes. \'Why?\' Thrown into its eyes, just like that! \'Why? It\'s senseless! Why?\'\\" - Kostoglotov","Writers haven\'t got any rockets to blast off. We don\'t even trundle the most insignificant auxiliary vehicle. We haven\'t got any military might. So what can literature do in the face of the merciless onslaught of open violence? One word of truth outweighs the whole world.","You know, that is one of the consequences of the weak sense of responsibility of the press. The press does not feel responsibility for its judgments. It makes judgments and attaches labels with the greatest of ease. Mediocre journalists simply make headlines of their conclusions, which suddenly become generally accepted.","That\'s what arrest is: it\'s a blinding flash and a blow which shifts the present instantly into the past and the impossible into omnipotent actuality.That\'s all. And neither for the first hour nor for the first day will you be able to grasp anything else.Except that in your desperation the fake circus moon will blink at you: \\"It\'s a mistake! They\'ll set things right!\\"And everything which is by now comprised in the traditional, even literary, image of an arrest will pile up and take shape, not in your own disordered memory, but in what your family and your neighbors in your apartment remember: The sharp nighttime ring or the rude knock at the door. The insolent entrance of the unwiped jackboots of the unsleeping State Security operatives. The frightened and cowed civilian witness at their backs. (And what function does this civilian witness serve? The victim doesn\'t even dare think about it and the operatives don\'t remember, but that\'s what the regulations call for, and so he has to sit there all night long and sign in the morning. 1 For the witness, jerked from his bed, it is torture too\u2014to go out night after night to help arrest his own neighbors and acquaintances.","That\'s why there\'s a devil\u2014to judge the priests.","One should never direct people towards happiness, becausehappiness too is an idol of the market-place. One should directthem towards mutual affection. A beast gnawing at its preycan be happy too, but only human beings can feel affectionfor each other, and this is the highest achievement they canaspire to.","Should we wrap it all up and simply say that they arrested the innocent? But we omitted saying that the very concept of guilt had been repealed by the proletarian revolution and, at the beginning of the thirties, was defined as rightist opportunism! So we can\'t even discuss these out-of-date concepts, guilt and innocence.","Shukhov had figured it all out. If he didn\'t sign he\'d be shot. If he signed he\'d still get a chance to live. So he signed.","Shukhov ate his supper without bread--a double portion and bread on top of it would be too rich. So he\'d save the bread. You get no thanks from your belly--it always forgets what you\'ve just done for it and comes begging again the next day.","...if you live in a graveyard, you can\'t weep for everyone.","... History sometimes does know revenge, a sort of voluptuous and delayed justice, but chooses strange forms for it and unexpected executors of its will.","Over the years I have had much occasion to ponder this word, the intelligentsia. We are all very fond of including ourselves in it\u2014but you see not all of us belong. In the Soviet Union this word has acquired a completely distorted meaning. They began to classify among the intelligentsia all those who don\'t work (and are afraid to) with their hands. All the Party, government, military, and trade union bureaucrats have been included. All bookkeepers and accountants\u2014the mechanical slaves of Debit. All office employees. And with even greater ease we include here all teachers (even those who are no more than talking textbooks and have neither independent knowledge nor an independent view of education). All physicians, including those capable only of making doodles on the patients\' case histories. And without the slightest hesitation all those who are only in the vicinity of editorial offices, publishing houses, cinema studios, and philharmonic orchestras are included here, not even to mention those who actually get published, make films, or pull a fiddle bow.And yet the truth is that not one of these criteria permits a person to be classified in the intelligentsia. If we do not want to lose this concept, we must not devalue it. The intellectual is not defined by professional pursuit and type of occupation. Nor are good upbringing and good family enough in themselves to produce and intellectual. An intellectual is a person whose interests in and preoccupation with the spiritual side of life are insistent and constant and not forced by external circumstances, even flying in the face of them. An intellectual is a person whose thought is nonimitative.","\xd4ng n\xean hi\u1ec3u \u0111i\u1ec1u n\xe0y, v\xe0 \xf4ng n\xean n\xf3i l\u1ea1i \u0111i\u1ec1u n\xe0y v\u1edbi nh\u1eefng ng\u01b0\u1eddi trong b\u1ecdn \xf4ng r\u1eb1ng c\xe1c \xf4ng ch\u1ec9 m\u1ea1nh khi n\xe0o c\xe1c \xf4ng kh\xf4ng t\u01b0\u1edbc \u0111o\u1ea1t c\u1ee7a ng\u01b0\u1eddi kh\xe1c h\u1ebft t\u1ea5t c\u1ea3 m\u1ecdi th\u1ee9.

All that is subtle in human psychology and in the structure of society (which is even more complex), all of this is reduced to crude economic processes. The whole created being\u2014man\u2014is reduced to matter. It is characteristic that Communism is so devoid of arguments that it has none to advance against its opponents in our Communist countries. It lacks arguments and hence there is the club, the prison, the concentration camp, and insane asylums with forced confinement.","Finally, he gave up trying to quiet her and lit a cigarette, the last resort of a man who finds himself in an intolerably stupid position.","Archaeologists have not yet discovered any stage of human existence without art. Even in the half-light before the dawn of humanity we received this gift from Hands we did not manage to discern. Nor have we managed to ask: Why was this gift given to us and what are we to do with it? And all those prophets who are predicting that art is disintegrating, that it has used up all its forms, that it is dying, are mistaken. We are the ones who shall die. And art will remain. The question is whether before we perish we shall understand all its aspects and all its ends.","Now for the first time you were about to see people who were not your enemies.

What kind of disastrous path lies ahead of us if we do not have the chance to purge ourselves of that putrefaction rotting inside our body? What, then, can Russia teach the world?","At no time have governments been moralists. They never imprisoned people and executed them for having done something. They imprisoned and executed them to keep them from doing something. They imprisoned all those POW\'s, of course, not for treason to the motherland, because it was absolutely clear even to a fool that only the Vlasov men could be accused of treason. They imprisoned all of them to keep them from telling their fellow villagers about Europe. What the eye doesn\'t see, the heart doesn\'t grieve for.","Arrest is an instantaneous, shattering thrust, expulsion, somersault from one state into another.","My life is over, a little early to be sure; but there\'s nothing to be done about it. I shall never return to freedom. I am condemned to die - now or a little later. But later on, in truth, it will be even harder, an so the sooner the better. I no longer have any property whatsoever. For me those I love have died, and for them I have died. From today on, my body is useless and alien to me. Only my spirit and my conscience remain precious and important to me.","Shukhov enjoyed it. He liked people pointing at him \u2014 see that man? He\'s nearly done his time \u2014 but he didn\'t let himself get excited about it. Those who\'d come to the end of their time during the war had all been kept in, \\"pending further orders\\" \u2014 till \'46. So those originally sentenced to three years did five altogether. They could twist the law any way they liked. When your ten years were up, they could say good, have another ten. Or pack you off to some godforsaken place of exile.","Just as that puzzled savage who has picked up - a strange cast-up from the ocean? - something unearthed from the sands? - or an obscure object fallen down from the sky? - intricate in curves, it gleams first dully and then with a bright thrust of light. Just as he turns it this way and that, turns it over, trying to discover what to do with it, trying to discover some mundane function within his own grasp, never dreaming of its higher function.So also we, holding Art in our hands, confidently consider ourselves to be its masters; boldly we direct it, we renew, reform and manifest it; we sell it for money, use it to please those in power; turn to it at one moment for amusement - right down to popular songs and night-clubs, and at another - grabbing the nearest weapon, cork or cudgel - for the passing needs of politics and for narrow-minded social ends. But art is not defiled by our efforts, neither does it thereby depart from its true nature, but on each occasion and in each application it gives to us a part of its secret inner light.","The root destruction of religion in the country, which throughout the twenties and thirties was one of the most important goals of the GPU-NKVD, could be realized only by mass arrests of Orthodox believers. Monks and nuns, whose black habits had been a distinctive feature of Old Russian life, were intensively rounded up on every hand, placed under arrest, and sent into exile. They arrested and sentenced active laymen. The circles kept getting bigger, as they raked in ordinary believers as well, old people and particularly women, who were the most stubborn believers of all and who, for many long years to come, would be called \'nuns\' in transit prisons and in camps.True, they were supposedly being arrested and tried not for their actual faith but for openly declaring their convictions and for bringing up their children in the same spirit. As Tanya Khodkevich wrote:You can pray freelyBut just so God alone can hear.(She received a ten-year sentence for these verses.) A person convinced that he possessed spiritual truth was required to conceal it from his own children! In the twenties the religious education of children was classified as a political crime under Article 58-10 of the Code--in other words, counterrevolutionary propaganda! True, one was permitted to renounce one\'s religion at one\'s trial: it didn\'t often happen but it nonetheless did happen that the father would renounce his religion and remain at home to raise the children while the mother went to the Solovetsky Islands. (Throughout all those years women manifested great firmness in their faith.) All persons convicted of religious activity received \'tenners,\' the longest term then given.(In those years, particularly in 1927, in purging the big cities for the pure society that was coming into being, they sent prostitutes to the Solovetsky Islands along with the \'nuns.\' Those lovers of a sinful earthly life were given three-year sentences under a more lenient article of the Code. The conditions in prisoner transports, in transit prisons, and on the Solovetsky Islands were not of a sort to hinder them from plying their merry trade among the administrators and the convoy guards. And three years later they would return with laden suitcases to the places they had come from. Religious prisoners, however, were prohibited from ever returning to their children and their home areas.)","It\'s warmed up a bit,\\" Shukhov decided. \\"Eighteen below, no more.

Everybody should know that.","Libertatea noastra se construieste pe ceea ce nu stie celalalt despre existentele noastre.","Our present system is unique in world history, because over and above its physical and economic constraints, it demands of us total surrender of our souls, continuous and active participation in the general, conscious lie. To this putrefaction of the soul, this spiritual enslavement, human beings who wish to be human cannot consent. When Caesar, having exacted what is Caesar\'s, demands still more insistently that we render him what is God\'s \u2014 that is a sacrifice we dare not make!","All history is one continuous pestilence.

You would be beaten, burned, tortured, and steamed to the point of death or until they finally came to believe you. But if you had gold, you could determine the extent of your torture, the limits of your endurance, and your own fate. Psychologically, this situation was, incidentally, not easier but more difficult, because if you made an erroryou would always be ridden by a guilty conscience. Of course, anyone who had already mastered the rules of the institution would yield and give up his gold\u2014that was easier. But it was a mistake to give it up too readily. They would refuse to believe you had coughed it all up, and they would continue to hold you. But you\'d be wrong, too, to wait too long before yielding: you\'d end up kicking the bucket or they\'d paste a term on you out of meanness. One of the Tatar draymen endured all the tortures: he had no gold! They imprisoned his wife, too, and tortured her, but the Tatar stuck to his story: no gold! Then they arrested his daughter: the Tatar couldn\'t take it any more. He coughed up 100,000 rubles. At this point they let his family go, but slapped a prison term on him.","As he spoke, he looked into their faces and saw, as though in his own features, that fundamentally they all bore the indelible impress of a similar background: army tradition; long spells of garrison service in a world isolated from the rest of society; a sense of alienation, of being despised by that society and ridiculed by liberal writers; the official ban on discussing politics and political literature, resulting in a blunting or stultifying of the intellect; a permanent shortage of money; and yet, despite it all, the knowledge that they represented, in purified and concentrated form, the vitality and courage of the whole nation.","In his musings during the past few weeks Vadim had discovered an important and at first glance paradoxical point: a man of talent can understand and accept death more easily than a man with none\u2014yet the former has more to lose. A man of no talent craves long life, yet Epicurus had once observed that a fool, if offered eternity, would not know what to do with it.","They dream of the happiness of stretching out one\'s legs and of the relief one feels after going to the toilet. In Orotukan the earth thaws only in the summer and only to the depth of three feet\u2014and only then can they bury the bones of those who died during the winter. And you have the right to arrange your own life under the blue sky and the hot sun, to get a drink of water, to stretch, to travel wherever you like without a convoy [escort]. So what\'s this about unwiped feet? And what\'s this about a mother-in-law? What about the main thing in life, all its riddles? If you want, I\'ll spell it out for you right now. Do not pursue what is illusory\u2014property and position: all that is gained at the expense of your nerves decade after decade, and is confiscated in one fell night. Live with a steady superiority over life\u2014don\'t be afraid of misfortune, and do not yearn after happiness; it is, after all, all the same: the bitter doesn\'t last forever, and the sweet never fills the cup to overflowing. It is enough if you don\'t freeze in the cold and if thirst and hunger don\'t claw at your insides. If your back isn\'t broken, if your feet can walk, if both arms can bend, if both eyes see, if both ears hear, then whom should you envy? And why? Our envy of others devours us most of all. Rub your eyes and purify your heart\u2014and prize above all else in the world those who love you and who wish you well. Do not hurt them or scold them, and never part from any of them in anger; after all, you simply do not know: it may be your last act before your arrest, and that will be how you are imprinted in their memory!","Of course in the present situation the Communists have to use various disguises. Sometimes we hear words like \\"popular front,\\" at other times \\"dialogue with Christianity.\\" For Communists a dialogue with Christianity!

He no longer knew whether he wanted to be free or not...it had gradually dawned on him that people like himself were not allowed to go home but were packed off into exile. And there was no knowing where the living was easier \u2013 here or there. The one thing he might want to ask God for was to let him go home. But they wouldn\'t let him go home.","What had been acceptable under Tsar Aleksei Mikhailovich in the seventeenth century, what had already been regarded as barbarism under Peter the Great, what might have been used against ten or twenty people in all during the time of Biron in the mid-eighteenth century, what had already become totally impossible under Catherine the Great, was all being practiced during the flowering of the glorious twentieth century\u2014in a society based on socialist principles, and at a time when airplanes were flying and the radio and talking films had already appeared\u2014not by one scoundrel alone in one secret place only, but by tens of thousands of specially trained human beasts standing over millions of defenseless victims.","\u041b\u0443\u0447\u0448\u0435 \u0445\u043b\u0435\u0431 \u0441 \u0432\u043e\u0434\u043e\u0439 \u0447\u0435\u043c \u043f\u0438\u0440\u043e\u0433 \u0441 \u0431\u0435\u0434\u043e\u0439Better bread and water than pie with trouble","A human being,\\" Kondrasev continued, \\"possesses from his birth a certain essence, the nucleus, as it were, of the human being.

Because he has in him an image of perfection which in rare moments suddenly emerges before his spiritual gaze.","And so in Moscow they began a systematic search, block by block. Someone had to be arrested everywhere. The slogan was: \\"We are going to bang our fist on the table so hard that the world will shake with terror!\\" It was to the Lubyanka, to the Butyrki, that the Black Marias, the passenger cars, the enclosed trucks, the open hansom cabs kept moving, even by day. There was a jam at the gates, a jam in the courtyard. They didn\'t have time to unload and register those they\'d arrested. (And the same situation existed","If the intellectuals in the plays of Chekhov, who spent all their time guessing what would happen in twenty, thirty, or forty years, had been told that in forty years interrogation by torture would be practiced in Russia; that prisoners would have their skulls squeezed with iron rings; that a human being would be lowered into an acid bath; that they would be trussed up naked to be bitten by ants and bedbugs; that a ramrod heated over a primus stove would be thrust up their anal canal (the \u2018secret brand\u2019); that a man\u2019s genitals would be slowly crushed beneath the toe of a jackboot; and that, in the luckiest possible circumstances, prisoners would be tortured by being kept from sleeping for a week, by thirst, and by being beaten to a bloody pulp, not one of Chekhov\u2019s plays would have gotten to its end because all the heroes would have gone off to insane asylums.","A prisoner five years between the shafts never hurries. He knows that what comes next can only be worse.","A person who is not inwardly prepared for the use of violence against him is always weaker than the person committing the violence.

Everything was so arranged in the camp that the prisoners egged one another on. It was like this: either you all got a bit extra or you all croaked. You\'re loafing you bastard\u2014do you think I\'m willing to go hungry just because of you? Put your guts into it, slob.","Shukhov gazed at the ceiling in silence. Now he didn\'t know whether he wanted freedom or not. At first he\'d longed for it. Every night he\'d counted the days of his stretch\u2014how many had passed, how many were coming. And then he\'d grown bored with counting. And then it became clear that men like him wouldn\'t ever be allowed to return home, that they\'d be exiled.","Generally speaking, he remarked, \u201cthe family doctor is the most comforting figure in our lives, and now he\u2019s being pulled up by the roots. The family doctor is a figure without whom the family cannot exist in a developed society. He knows the needs of each member of the family, just as the mother knows their tastes. There\u2019s no shame in taking to him some trivial complaint you\u2019d never take to the outpatients\u2019 clinic, which entails getting an appointment card and waiting your turn, and where there\u2019s a quota of nine patients an hour. And yet all neglected illnesses arise out of these trifling complaints. How many adult human beings are there, now, at this minute, rushing about in mute panic wishing they could find a doctor, the kind of person to whom they can pour out the fears they have deeply concealed or even found shameful? Looking for the right doctor is the sort of thing you can\u2019t always ask your friends for advice about. You can\u2019t advertise for one in a newspaper either. In fact, it\u2019s a matter as essentially intimate as a search for a husband or a wife. But nowadays it\u2019s easier to find a good wife than a doctor ready to look after you personally for as long as you want, and who understands you fully and truly.\u201d","Shukhov had been told that this old man\'d been in camps and prisons more years than you could count and had never come under any amnesty. When one ten-year stretch was over they slapped on another. Shukhov took a good look at him close up. In the camp you could pick him out among all the men with their bent backs because he was straight as a ramrod. When he sat at the table it looked like he was sitting on something to raise himself up higher. There hadn\'t been anything to shave off his head for a long time-he\'d lost all his hair because of the good life. His eyes didn\'t shift around the mess hall all the time to see what was going on, and he was staring over Shukhov\'s head and looking at something nobody else could see. He ate his thin gruel with a worn old wooden spoon, and he took his time. He didn\'t bend down low over the bowl like all the others did, but brought the spoon up to his mouth. He didn\'t have a single tooth either top or bottom-he chewed the bread with his hard gums like they were teeth. His face was all worn-out but not like a goner\'s-it was dark and looked like it had been hewed out of stone. And you could tell from his big rough hands with the dirt worked in them he hadn\'t spent many of his long years doing any of the soft jobs. You could see his mind was set on one thing-never to give in. He didn\'t put his eight ounces of bread in all the filth on the table like everybody else but laid it on a clean little piece of rag that\'d been washed over and over again.","Martin Latsis, writing for the newspaper Red Terror, November 1, 1918: \u201cWe are not fighting against single individuals. We are exterminating the bourgeoisie as a class. It is not necessary during the interrogation to look for evidence proving that the accused opposed the Soviets by word or action. The first question you should ask him is what class does he belong to, what is his origin, his education and his profession. These are the questions that will determine the fate of the accused. Such is the sense and essence of red terror.","Just as a star suddenly flares to a hundred times its previous brightness -- and then fades away, so, too, a human being not disposed to be a political may nonetheless flare up briefly and intensely in prison and perish as a result. Ordinarily we do not learn about these cases. Sometimes there is a witness to tell about them. Sometimes there is merely a faded piece of paper in front of us on which we can only build hypothesis;","... \\"the historical necessity of development\\" -- you can spout that nonsense about anything and you\'ll always be right.","And we, from the whole of our life experience there, have concluded that there is only one way to withstand violence: with firmness.","Even a strong man had no way left him to fight the prison machine, except perhaps suicide. But is suicide really resistance? Isn\'t it actually submission?","The Communist leaders respect only firmness and have contempt for persons who continually give in to them.","These people, who had experienced on their own hides twenty-four years of Communist happiness, knew by 1941 what as yet no one else in the world knew: that nowhere on the planet, nowhere in history, was there a regime more vicious, more bloodthirsty, and at the same time more cunning and ingenious than the Bolshevik, the self-styled Soviet regime. That no other regime on earth could compare with it either in the number of those it had done to death, in hardiness, in the range of its ambitions, in its thoroughgoing and unmitigated totalitarianism\u2014no, not even the regime of its pupil Hitler, which at that time blinded Western eyes to all else.","In the First World War we lost in all about three million killed. In the Second we lost twenty million (so Khrushchev said; according to Stalin it was only seven million. Was Nikita being too generous? Or couldn\'t Iosif keep track of his capital?) All those odes!

You\u2019re a member of the collective!\u2019 That\u2019s right. But only while he\u2019s alive. When the time comes for him to die, we release him from the collective. He may be a member, but he has to die alone. It\u2019s only he who is saddled with the tumor, not the whole collective.","... I have no knowledge of the world so I read in peace.","There were once again believers, who this time were unwilling to work on Sundays. (They had introduced the five-and the six-day week.) And there were collective farmers sent up for sabotage because they refused to work on religious feast days, as had been their custom in the era of individual farms.And, always, there were those who refused to become NKVD informers. (Among them were priests who refused to violate the secrecy of the confessional, for the Organs had very quickly discovered how useful had very quickly discovered how useful it was to learn the content of confessions\u2014the only use they found for religion.) And members of non-Orthodox sects were arrested on an ever-wider scale. And the Big Solitaire game with the socialists went on and on.","But he knew his Boss. One must never work full force for Stalin, never go all out. He did not tolerate the flat failure to carry out his orders, but he hated thoroughly successful performance because he saw in it a diminution of his own uniqueness. No one but himself must be able to do anything flawlessly.So even when he seemed to be straining in harness, Abakumov was pulling at half-strength\u2014and so was everyone else.Just as King Midas turned everything to gold, Stalin turned everything to mediocrity.","Wherever they went\u2014Moscow, Tehran, the Syrian coast, Switzerland\u2014a furnished house, villa, or apartment awaited the young couple.

In Sverdlovsk one case involved thirty secondary schoolteachers and the head of the Provincial Education Department, Perel. 37 One of the terrible accusations against them was that they had made arrangements to have a New Year\'s tree in order to burn down the school.

The labor of the zeks was needed for degrading and particularly heavy work, which no one, under socialism, would wish to perform.

For work with pick and spade\u2014in the flowering of the twentieth century. For the erection of the great construction projects of socialism, when the economic means for them did not yet exist.","Those who floated in the ark were weightless and had weightless thoughts.

Their heads were not filled with petty official calculations, intrigues, promotions, and their shoulders were not burdened with concerns about housing, fuel, bread, and clothes for the children. Love, which from time immemorial has been the delight and the torment of humanity, was powerless to communicate to them its thrill or its agony. Their prison terms were so long that no one even thought of the time when he would go out into freedom. Men with exceptional Intellect, education, and experience, but too devoted to their families to have much of themselves left over for their friends, here belonged only to friends.","Sopa yemi\u015f k\xf6pe\u011fe k\u0131rbac\u0131 bir kere g\xf6sterin yeter!","As early as 1921 interrogations usually took place at night. At that time, too, they shone automobile lights in the prisoner\'s face (the Ryazan Cheka\u2014Stelmakh). And at the Lubyanka in 1926 (according to the testimony of Berta Gandal) they made use of the hot-air heating system to fill the cell first with icy-cold and then with stinking hot air. And there was an airtight cork-lined cell in which there was no ventilation and they cooked the prisoners. The poet Klyuyev was apparently confined in such a cell and Berta Gandal also. A participant in the Yaroslavl uprising of 1918, Vasily Aleksandrovich Kasyanov, described how the heat in such a cell was turned up until your blood began to ooze through your pores. When they saw this happening through the peephole, they would put the prisoner on a stretcher and take him off to sign his confession. The \\"hot\\" and \\"salty\\" methods of the \\"gold\\" period are well known. And in Georgia in 1926 they used lighted cigarettes to burn the hands of prisoners under interrogation. In Metekhi Prison they pushed prisoners into a cesspool in the dark.","Truth, it seems, is always bashful, easily reduced to silence by the too blatant encroachment of falsehood.","...as if it were possible to liberate anyone who has not first become liberated in his own soul.","Tanr\u0131\'ya kar\u015f\u0131 oldu\u011fumu sanma, dedi.

Likeliest of all, Stalin simply figured out that the whole countryside, not just 200,000 people, would soon die of famine anyway, so why go to the trouble? And instantly the whole TKP trial was called off. All those who had \\"confessed\\" were told they could repudiate their confessions (one can picture their happiness!).

In notebooks, in file folders, in homemade binders, in tied and untied bundles, and simply in loose pages. The manuscripts lay there like the burial mound of some interred human spirit, its conical top rearing higher than the interrogator\'s desk, almost blocking me from his view.

Beginning in 1924, because of national unemployment, the courts reduced the number of verdicts which sentenced prisoners to corrective labor while they continued to live at home and increased short-term prison sentences. These cases involved only nonpolitical offenders, of course. As a result, prisons were overcrowded with short-termers serving sentences of up to six months, and not enough use was being made of them in labor colonies. At the beginning of 1929, the People\'s Commissariat of justice of the U.S.S.R., in Circular No. 5, condemned short-term sentences and, on November 6, 1929, the eve of the twelfth anniversary of the October Revolution, when the country was supposedly entering on the construction of socialism, a decree of the Central Executive Committee and the Council of People\'s Commissars simply forbade all sentences of less than one year!","making no attempt to conceal his hope that he, a son of the Russian people, might also be cured by this simple Russian folk remedy.

Why deal in fantasies!) \\"Aha, so you are not sure? Then write a list of people you can guarantee are one hundred percent Soviet people! But you are guaranteeing, you understand? If you provide even one of them with false references, you yourself will go to prison immediately. So why aren\'t you writing?\\" \\"Well, I\u2026 can\'t guarantee.\\" \\"Aha, you can\'t?

One would even feel awkward to refer to it as a science. Leaving aside the exact sciences, such as physics, mathematics, and the natural sciences, even the social sciences can predict an event\u2014when, in what way and how an event might occur. Communism has never made any such forecasts. It has never said where, when, and precisely what is going to happen. Nothing but declamations. Rhetoric to the effect that the world proletariat will overthrow the world bourgeoisie and the most happy and radiant society will then arise.","We forget everything. What we remember is not what actually happened, not history, but merely that hackneyed dotted line they have chosen to drive into our memories by incessant hammering. I do not know whether this is a trait common to all mankind, but it is certainly a trait of our people, And it is a vexing one. It may have its source in goodness, but it is vexing nonetheless. It makes us an easy prey for liars.","Archpriest A. N.

How much should one pay, how much is too much? As they teach in schools nowadays: \\"The dearest thing a man has is life, he lives but once.\\" That means cling to life at any cost. The camps helped many of us to reach the conclusion that betrayal, the ruin of good and helpless people, is too high a price. Life isn\'t worth it. But as for the fawning, the flattery, the lies, people in the camp differed. Some said these were an acceptable price, and perhaps they were right.But what about this price - to save one\'s life at the cost of surrendering everything that gives it color, flavor, and sparkle? To get a life of digestion, breathing, muscular and mental activity, and nothing more? To become a walking husk of a man - isn\'t that an exuberant price? It would be a mockery. Should I pay it?

He then proceeded to a further step, which jurists of the last two thousand years had not been willing to take: that the truth established by interrogation and trial could not be absolute, but only, so to speak, relative. Therefore, when we sign a sentence ordering someone to be shot we can never be absolutely certain, but only approximately, in view of certain hypotheses, and in a certain sense, that we are punishing a guilty person. Thence arose the most practical conclusion: that it was useless to seek absolute evidence\u2014for evidence is always relative\u2014or unchallengeable witnesses\u2014for they can say different things at different times. The proofs of guilt were relative, approximate, and the interrogator could find them, even when there was no evidence and no witness, without leaving his office, \u201cbasing his conclusions not only on his own intellect but also on his Party sensitivity, his moral forces\u201d (in other words, the superiority of someone who has slept well, has been well fed, and has not been beaten up) \u201cand on his character\u201d (i.e., his willingness to apply cruelty!).

Technological successes have been tremendous but without a spiritual component mankind will not only be unable to further develop but cannot even preserve itself. There is a belief in an eternal, an infinite progress which has practically become a religion. This is a mistake of the eighteenth century, of the Enlightenment era.","However, the simple-minded Middle Ages used dramatic and picturesque methods to squeeze out the desired confessions: the rack, the wheel, the bed of nails, impalement, hot coals, etc. In the twentieth century, taking advantage of our more highly developed medical knowledge and extensive prison experience (and someone seriously defended a doctoral dissertation on this theme), people came to realize that the accumulation of such impressive apparatus was superfluous and that, on a mass scale, it was also cumbersome. And in addition\xa0.\xa0.\xa0. In addition, there was evidently one other circumstance. As always, Stalin did not pronounce that final word, and his subordinates had to guess what he wanted. Thus, like a jackal, he left himself an escape hole, so that he could, if he wanted, beat a retreat and write about \u201cdizziness from success. After all, for the first time in human history the calculated torture of millions was being undertaken, and, even with all his strength and power, Stalin could not be absolutely sure of success. In dealing with such an enormous mass of material, the effects of the experiment might differ from those obtained from a smaller sample. An unforeseen explosion might take place, a slippage in a geological fault, or even world-wide disclosure.

It is against the natural order of things for those who are youngest, with the least experience of life, to have the greatest influence in directing the life of society. One can say then that this is what forms the spirit of the age, the current of public opinion, when people in authority, well known professors and scientists, are reluctant to enter into an argument even when they hold a different opinion.

He then proceeded to a further step, which jurists of the last two thousand years had not been willing to take: that the truth established by interrogation and trial could not be absolute, but only, so to speak, relative. Therefore, when we sign a sentence ordering someone to be shot we can never be absolutely certain, but only approximately, in view of certain hypotheses, and in a certain sense, that we are punishing a guilty person. Thence arose the most practical conclusion: that it was useless to seek absolute evidence-for evidence is always relative-or unchallengeable witnesses-for they can say different things at different times. The proofs of guilt were relative, approximate, and the interrogator could find them, even when there was no evidence and no witness, without leaving his office, \u201cbasing his conclusions not only on his own intellect but also on his Party sensitivity, his moral forces\u201d (in other words, the superiority of someone who has slept well, has been well fed, and has not been beaten up) \u201cand on his character\u201d (i.e., his willingness to apply cruelty!)\u2026 In only one respect did Vyshinsky fail to be consistent and retreat from dialectical logic: for some reason, the executioner\u2019s bullet which he allowed was not relative but absolute\u2026\u201d","All this is happening right next to you; you can almost touch it, but it\'s invisible ...

I am surprised that pragmatic philosophy consistently scorns moral considerations; and nowadays in the Western press we read a candid declaration of the principle that moral considerations have nothing to do with politics. I would remind you that in 1939 England thought differently. If moral considerations were not applicable to politics, then it would be incomprehensible why England went to war with Hitler\'s Germany. Pragmatically, you could have gotten out of the situation, but England chose the moral course, and experienced and demonstrated to the world perhaps the most brilliant and heroic period in its history.","If\u2026if\u2026 We didn\u2019t love freedom enough.

Peasant ownership of land is a guarantee of order in the state. The peasant without land of his own lends a ready ear to false doctrine, and is susceptible to those who urge him to satisfy his desire for land by force. The solid peasant on land of his own is a barrier against all destructive movements, against any form of communism, which is why all socialists are so desperately anxious not to see the peasant released from the slavery of the commune, not to let him build up his strength. (And of course overcrowded villages make the work of agitators easier.)

It is enough if you don\'t freeze in the cold and if thirst and hunger don\'t claw at your insides. If your back isn\'t broken, if your feet can walk, if both arms bend, if both eyes see, and if both ears hear, then whom should you envy? And why? Our envy of others devours us most of all. Rub your eyes and purify your heart - and prize above all else in the world those who love you and wish you well.","That was the price you had to pay.

Not only she but many of her girlfriends had graduated from the institute without any such knowledge. There were many reasons for this. The young girls had come from high schools with very little grounding in mathematics and physics. They had learned in the upper grades that at faculty council meetings the school director had scolded the teachers for giving out failing marks, and that even if a pupil didn\'t study at all he received a diploma. In the institute, when they found time to sit down to study, they made their way through the mathematics and radio-technology as through a dense pine forest. But more often there was no time at all. Every fall for a month or more the students were taken to collective farms to harvest potatoes. For this reason, they had to attend lectures for eight and ten hours a day all the rest of the year, leaving no time to study their course work. On Monday evenings there was political indoctrination. Once a week a meeting of some kind was obligatory. Then one had to do socially useful work, too: issue bulletins, organize concerts, and it was also necessary to help at home, to shop, to wash, to dress. And what about the movies? And the theater? And the club? If a girl didn\'t have some fun and dance a bit during her student years, when would she do so afterward? For their examinations Simochka and her girlfriends wrote many cribs, which they hid in those sections of female clothing denied to males, and at the exams they pulled out the one the needed, smoothed it out, and turned it in as a work sheet. The examiners, of course, could have easily discovered the women students\' ignorance, but they themselves were overburdened with committee meetings, assemblies, a variety of plans and reports to the dean\'s office and to the rector. It was hard on them to have to give an examination a second time. Besides, when their students failed, the examiners were reprimanded as if the failures were spoiled goods in a production process\u2014according to the well-known theory that there are no bad pupils, only bad teachers. Therefore the examiners did not try to trip the students up but, in fact, attempted to get them through the examination with as good results as possible.","Ideology\u2014that is what gives evildoing its long-sought justification and gives the evildoer the necessary steadfastness and determination.

However, in memory they get all mixed up together because they are so similar: in the illiteracy of their convoys, in their inept roll calls based on case files; the long waiting under the beating sun or autumn drizzle; the still longer body searches that involve undressing completely; their haircuts with unsanitary clippers; their cold, slippery baths; their foul-smelling toilets; their damp and moldy corridors; their perpetually crowded, nearly always dark, wet cells; the warmth of human flesh flanking you on the floor or on the board bunks; the bumpy ridges of bunk heads knocked together from boards; the wet, almost liquid, bread; the gruel cooked from what seems to be silage. And","Capitalist England fought on our side against Hitler; Marx had eloquently described the poverty and suffering of the working class in that same England. Why was it that at this war only one traitor could be found among them, the businessman \'Lord Haw Haw\' - but in our country millions?","[T]hey were possessed and directed by the ... strongest instincts of the lower sphere ... greed for power and greed for gain. ... Power is a poison well known for thousands of years. If only no one were ever to acquire material power over others! But to the human being who has faith in some force that holds dominion over all of us, and who is therefore conscious of his own limitations, power is not necessarily fatal. For those, however, who are unaware of any higher sphere it is a deadly poison. For them there is no antidote. ... If only there were evil people somewhere insidiously committing evil deeds, and it were necessary only to separate them from the rest of us and destroy them. But the line dividing good and evil cuts through the heart of every human being. ... Confronted by the pit into which we are about to toss those who have done us harm, we halt, stricken dumb: it is after all only because of the way things worked out that they were the executioners and we weren\'t.","Two Leningrad women were summoned to the police station. Had they been at a party with some men? Yes. Had sexual intercourse taken place? (This had already been established with the aid of a reliable informer.) Er\u2014yes. Right, then, which is it: did you take part in the sexual act voluntarily or against your will? If voluntarily, we shall have to regard you as prostitutes, you will hand over your passports and get out of Leningrad in forty-eight hours. If it was against your will, you must bring a charge of rape! The women were not a bit anxious to leave Leningrad! So the men got twelve years each.","If humanism were right in declaring that man is born to be happy, he would not be born to die. Since his body is doomed to die, his task on earth evidently must be of a more spiritual nature. It cannot be unrestrained enjoyment of everyday life. It cannot be the search for the best ways to obtain material goods and then cheerfully get the most out of them. It has to be the fulfillment of a permanent, earnest duty so that one\'s life journey may become an experience of moral growth, so that one may leave life a better human being than one started it. It is imperative to review the table of widespread human values. Its present incorrectness is astounding. It is not possible that assessment of the President\'s performance be reduced to the question of how much money one makes or of unlimited availability of gasoline. Only voluntary, inspired self-restraint can raise man above the world stream of materialism.","History moves too slowly for our lives or our hearts.","Separate church and state properly and do not touch the church; you will not lose a thing thereby.

Let us ask: On the whole, can a camp keeper be a good human being? What system of moral selection does life arrange for them? The first selection takes place on assignment to the MVD armies, MVD schools, or MVD courses. Every man with the slightest speck of spiritual training, with a minimally circumspect conscience, or capacity to distinguish good from evil, is instinctively going to back out and use every available means to avoid joining this dark legion. But let us concede that he did not succeed in backing out. A second selection comes during training and the first service assignment, when the bosses themselves take a close look and eliminate all those who manifest laxity (kindness) instead of strong will and firmness (cruelty and mercilessness). And then a third selection takes place over a period of many years: All those who had not visualized where and into what they were getting themselves now come to understand and are horrified. To be constantly a weapon of violence, a constant participant in evil! Not everyone can bring himself to this, and certainly not right off. You see, you are trampling on others\' lives. And inside yourself something tightens and bursts. You can\'t go on this was any longer! And although it is belated, men can still begin to fight their way out, report themselves ill, get disability certificates, accept lower pay, take off their shoulder boards\u2014anything just to get out, get out, get out!Does that mean the rest of them have got used to it? Yes. The rest of them have got used to it, and their life already seems normal to them. And useful too, of course. And even honorable. And some didn\'t have to get used to it; they had been that way from the start.","- Si atunci, ce inseamna sa fii destept.- Ce inseamna sa fii destept? Sa crezi ce-ti spun ochii si sa nu crezi ce ti se spune la ureche.","Stalinist logic ... said that every Soviet person who had lived abroad had to be imprisoned in camp ... Stalin feared that they might bring European freedom back from their European crusade ... I had seen downcast columns of returning war prisoners - the only people around who were grieving instead of celebrating. Even then their gloom had shocked me, though I didn\'t yet grasp the reason for it ... Very few of the war prisoners returned across the Soviet border as free men, and if one happened to get through by accident because of the prevailing chaos, he was seized later on ... the former POWs, looking out on the Motherland newly restored to them through the same barbed wire through which they had seen Germany ... When they arrived ... police vans were waiting, as were armed guards holding lists of names. They could not even shoot or stab themselves to death since all their weapons had been taken away. Some jumped off the high viaduct into the river or onto the stones ... But the West did not understand at all. The democratic West simply could not understand.","Punishment cells were set up in the two-story cathedral ... Poles the thickness of an arm were set from wall to wall and prisoners were ordered to sit on these poles all day ... one\'s feet could not reach the ground. And it was not so easy to keep balance ... the prisoner spent the entire day just trying to maintain his perch. If he fell, the jailers jumped in and beat him ... Every little island and every little hillock of the Archipelago had to be encircled by a hostile, stormy Soviet seascape ... Escapes multiplied ... For half a year the sea was frozen over, but not solidly, and in places there was open water, and the snowstorms raged, and the frost bit hard, and things were enveloped in mists and darkness. And in the spring ... there were the long white nights with clear visibility over long distances for the patrolling cutters ... it was only when the nights began to lengthen, in the late summer and the autumn, that the time was right ... for those who were out in work parties, where a prisoner might have freedom of movement and time to build a boat or a raft near the shore ... and to cast off at night ... and strike out at random, hoping above all to encounter a foreign ship ... The whole long history of the Archipelago, about which it has fallen to me to write this home-grown, homemade book, has, in the course of half a century, found in the Soviet Union almost no expression whatever in the printed word. In this a role was played by that same unfortunate happenstance by which camp watchtowers never got into scenes in films nor into landscapes painted by our artists ...","Books no longer inspired reverent joy but dread\u2014dread that he would never be able to hold his own with an author, that every new book he read would seduce and enslave him.","They arrested members of the nobility for their social origin. They arrested members of their families.

And once they had been arrested, there was no way back. You can\u2019t undo what has been done! The Sentinel of the Revolution never makes a mistake!\u201d","...she knew from school that that sort of literature was boring: Gorky was correct but somehow ponderous; Mayakovsky was very correct but somehow awkward; Saltykov-Shchedrin was progressive, but you could die yawning if you tried to read him through; Turgenev was limited to his nobleman\'s ideals; Goncharov was associated with the beginnings of Russian capitalism; Lev Tolstoi came to favor patriarchal peasantry\u2014and their teacher did not recommend reading Tolstoi\'s novels because they were very long and only confused the clear critical essays written about him. And then they reviewed a batch of writers totally unknown to anyone: Dostoyevsky, Stepnyak-Kravchinsky, and Sukhovo-Kobylin. It was true that one did not even have to remember the titles of their works. In all this long procession, only Pushkin shone like a sun.","Quite simply, no state can live without war, that is one of the state\u2019s essential functions. Father Severyan\u2019s enunciation was very precise. \u201cWar is the price we pay for living in a state. Before you can abolish war you will have to abolish all states. But that is unthinkable until the propensity to violence and evil is rooted out of human beings.
