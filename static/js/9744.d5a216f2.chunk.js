You won\u2019t even be sure, whether the storm is really over. But one thing is certain. When you come out of the storm, you won\u2019t be the same person who walked in. That\u2019s what this storm\u2019s all about.","Don\'t pointless things have a place, too, in this far-from-perfect world?","Say it before you run out of time. Say it before it\'s too late. Say what you\'re feeling. Waiting is a mistake.","People\'s memories are maybe the fuel they burn to stay alive.","Sometimes it\'s not the people who change, it\'s the mask that falls off.","I\'d be smiling and chatting away, and my mind would be floating around somewhere else, like a balloon with a broken string.","Spend your money on the things money can buy. Spend your time on the things money can\u2019t buy.","But if you knew you might not be able to see it again tomorrow, everything would suddenly become special and precious, wouldn\u2019t it?","Unclose your mind. You are not a prisoner. You are a bird in flight, searching the skies for dreams.","No matter how far you travel, you can never get away from yourself.","Despite your best efforts, people are going to be hurt when it\'s time for them to be hurt.","Is it possible, in the final analysis, for one human being to achieve perfect understanding of another? We can invest enormous time and energy in serious efforts to know another person, but in the end, how close can we come to that person\'s essence? We convince ourselves that we know the other person well, but do we really know anything important about anyone?","A person learns how to love himself through the simple acts of loving and being loved by someone else.","What happens when people open their hearts?\\"... \\"They get better.","Never let the darkness or negativity outside affect your inner self. Just wait until morning comes and the bright light will drown out the darkness.","She was truly a beautiful girl. I could feel a small polished stone sinking through the darkest waters of my heart. All those deep convoluted channels and passageways, and yet she managed to toss her pebble right down to the bottom of it all.","Life is a lot more fragile than we think. So you should treat others in a way that leaves no regrets. Fairly, and if possible, sincerely.","If you think of someone enough, you\u2019re sure to meet them again.","The things she most wanted to tell him would lose their meaning the moment she put them into words.","Pain is inevitable. Suffering is optional.","Memories warm you up from the inside. But they also tear you apart.","No matter how honestly you open up to someone, there are still things you cannot reveal.","Please remember: things are not what they seem.","Anyone who falls in love is searching for the missing pieces of themselves.","The world is an inherently unfair place.","The thing I\u2019m most afraid of is me. Of not knowing what I\u2019m going to do. Of not knowing what I\u2019m doing right now","If you really want to know something, you have to be willing to pay the price.","There are lots of things we never understand, no matter how many years we put on, no matter how much experience we accumulate.","You have to wait until tomorrow to find out what tomorrow will bring.","Strong and independent? I\u2019m neither. I\u2019m just being pushed along by reality, whether I like it or not.","In long-distance running the only opponent you have to beat is yourself, the way you used to be.","Did you ever see anyone shot by a gun without bleeding?","If you only read the books that everyone else is reading, you can only think what everyone else is thinking.","Whatever it is you\'re seeking won\'t come in the form you\'re expecting.","Gazing at the rain, I consider what it means to belong, to become part of something. To have someone cry for me.","This is what it means to live on. When granted hope, a person uses it as fuel, as a guidepost to life. It is impossible to live without hope.","No truth can cure the sorrow we feel from losing a loved one. No truth, no sincerity, no strength, no kindness can cure that sorrow. All we can do is see it through to the end and learn something from it, but what we learn will be no help in facing the next sorrow that comes to us without warning.","I can bear any pain as long as it has meaning.","If you can\u2019t understand it without an explanation, you can\u2019t understand it with an explanation.","Silence, I discover, is something you can actually hear.","Why do people have to be this lonely? What\'s the point of it all? Millions of people in this world, all of them yearning, looking to others to satisfy them, yet isolating themselves. Why? Was the earth put here just to nourish human loneliness?","What if I\u2019ve forgotten the most important thing?","As we go through life we gradually discover who we are, but the more we discover, the more we lose ourselves.","One heart is not connected to another through harmony alone. They are, instead, linked deeply through their wounds","I said nothing for a time, just ran my fingertips along the edge of the human-shaped emptiness that had been left inside me.","As time goes on, you\'ll understand. What lasts, lasts; what doesn\'t, doesn\'t. Time solves most things. And what time can\'t solve, you have to solve yourself.","Everything passes. Nobody gets anything for keeps. And that\'s how we\'ve got to live.","Maybe it\'s just hiding somewhere. Or gone on a trip to come home. But falling in love is always a pretty crazy thing. It might appear out of the blue and just grab you. Who knows \u2014 maybe even tomorrow.","Sometimes when I look at you, I feel I\'m gazing at a distant star. It\'s dazzling, but the light is from tens of thousands of years ago. Maybe the star doesn\'t even exist any more. Yet sometimes that light seems more real to me than anything.","She was a keen observer, a precise user of language, sharp-tongued and funny. She could stir your emotions. Yes, really, that\'s what she was so good at - stirring people\'s emotions, moving you. And she knew she had this power...I only realized later. At the time, I had no idea what she was doing to me.","I want to write about people who dream and wait for the night to end, who long for the light so they can hold the ones they love.","If you\'re in pitch blackness, all you can do is sit tight until your eyes get used to the dark.","Don\'t let thoughts of me hold you back. Just do what you want to do. Otherwise, I might end up taking you with me, and that is the one thing I don\'t want to do. I don\'t want to interfere with your life.","Fate seems to be taking me in some even stranger directions.","When I wake up, my pillow\u2019s cold and damp with tears. But tears for what? I have no idea.","Every one of us is losing something precious to us. Lost opportunities, lost possibilities, feelings we can never get back again. That\u2019s part of what it means to be alive.","In the world we live in, what we know and what we don\'t know are like Siamese twins, inseparable, existing in a state of confusion.","If you can love someone with your whole heart, even one person, then there\'s salvation in life. Even if you can\'t get together with that person.","She waited for the train to pass. Then she said, \\"I sometimes think that people\u2019s hearts are like deep wells. Nobody knows what\u2019s at the bottom. All you can do is imagine by what comes floating to the surface every once in a while.","When people tell a lie about something, they have to make up a bunch of lies to go with the first one. \u2018Mythomania\u2019 is the word for it.","I\'ll be happy if running and I can grow old together.","Whenever I look at the ocean, I always want to talk to people, but when I\'m talking to people, I always want to look at the ocean.","Loving another person is a wonderful thing, and if that love is sincere, no one ends up tossed into a labyrinth. You have to have more faith in yourself.","Precipitate as weather, she appeared from somewhere, then evaporated, leaving only memory.","As I see it, you are living with something that you keep hidden deep inside. Something heavy. I felt it from the first time I met you. You have a strong gaze, as if you have made up your mind about something. To tell you the truth, I myself carry such things around inside. Heavy things. That is how I can see it in you.","I have this strange feeling that I\'m not myself anymore. It\'s hard to put into words, but I guess it\'s like I was fast asleep, and someone came, disassembled me, and hurriedly put me back together again. That sort of feeling.","Be fearless, be brave, be bold, love yourself","Everyone who has something is afraid of losing it, and people with nothing are worried they\'ll forever have nothing. Everyone is the same.","There is nothing so cruel in this world as the desolation of having nothing to hope for.","You can hide memories, but you can\u2019t erase the history that produced them.","She was seriously in love, but she never made demands.","Nothing so consumes a person as meaningless exertion","Everything, everything seemed once-upon-a-time.","When you come out of the storm, you won\u2019t be the same person who walked in. That\u2019s what this storm\u2019s all about.","Does G get angry because it follows F in the alphabet? Does page 68 in a book start a revolution because it follows 67?","When I first met you, I felt a kind of contradiction in you. You\u2019re seeking something, but at the same time, you are running away for all you\u2019re worth.","All right, then, I thought: here I am in the bottom of a well.","I contented myself with whiskey, for medicinal purposes. It helped numb my various aches and pains. Not that the alcohol actually reduced the pain; it just gave the pain a life of its own, apart from mine.","Even if we could turn back, we\'d probably never end up where we started.","The journey I\'m taking is inside me. Just like blood travels down veins, what I\'m seeing is my inner self and what seems threatening is just the echo of the fear in my heart.","No matter what they wish for, no matter how far they go, people can never be anything but themselves. That\'s all.","Fate is like a small sandstorm that keeps changing directions. You change direction but the sandstorm chases you. You turn again, but the storm adjusts. Over and over you play this out, like some ominous dance with death just before dawn. Why? Because this storm isn\'t something that blew in from far away, something that has nothing to do with you. This storm is you. Something inside of you. So all you can do is give in to it, step right inside the storm, closing your eyes and plugging up your ears so the sand doesn\'t get in, and walk through it, step by step.","No matter what you tell me, no matter how legitimate your reasons, I can never just forget about you, I can never push the years we spent together out of my mind. I can\'t do it because it really happened, they are part of my life, and there is no way I can just erase them. That would be the same as erasing my own self.","That\'s gotta be one of the principles behind reality. Accepting things that are hard to comprehend, and leaving them that way.","Deep rivers run quiet.","She was, if anything, on the plain side, at least not the type to attract men wherever she went. But there was something in her face that was meant for me alone. Everytime we met, I took a good look at her. And loved what I saw.","If you remember me, then I don\'t care if everyone else forgets.","Find me now. Before someone else does.","We were young, and we had no need for prophecies. Just living was itself an act of prophecy.","What matters is deciding in your heart to accept another person completely. When you do that, it is always the first time and the last.","This is one more piece of advice I have for you: don\'t get impatient. Even if things are so tangled up you can\'t do anything, don\'t get desperate or blow a fuse and start yanking on one particular thread before it\'s ready to come undone. You have to realize it\'s going to be a long process and that you\'ll work on things slowly, one at a time.","Many are the women who can take their clothes off seductively, but women who can charm as they dress?","In this world, there are things you can only do alone, and things you can only do with somebody else. It\'s important to combine the two in just the right amount.","Most things are forgotten over time. Even the war itself, the life-and-death struggle people went through, is now like something from the distant past. We\'re so caught up in our everyday lives that events of the past, like ancient stars that have burned out, are no longer in orbit around our minds. There are just too many things we have to think about every day, too many new things we have to learn. New styles, new information, new technology, new terminology ... But still, no matter how much time passes, no matter what takes place in the interim, there are some things we can never assign to oblivion, memories we can never rub away. They remain with us forever, like a touchstone. And for me, what happened in the woods that day is one of these.","I have a million things to talk to you about. All I want in this world is you. I want to see you and talk. I want the two of us to begin everything from the beginning.","One heart is not connected to another through harmony alone. They are, instead, linked deeply through their wounds. Pain linked to pain, fragility to fragility. There is no silence without a cry of grief, no forgiveness without bloodshed, no acceptance without a passage through acute loss. That is what lies at the root of true harmony.","I was confident that I was a special person. But time slowly chips away at life. People don\'t just die when their time comes. They gradually die away, from the inside. And finally the day comes when you have to settle accounts. Nobody can escape it. People have to pay the price for what they\'ve received. I have only just learned that truth.","I probably still haven\u2019t completely adapted to the world. I don\u2019t know, I feel like this isn\u2019t the real world. The people, the scene: they just don\u2019t seem real to me.","For a long time, she held a special place in my heart. I kept this special place just for her, like a \\"Reserved\\" sign on a quiet corner table in a restaurant. Despite the fact that I was sure I\'d never see her again.","Whether you take the doughnut hole as a blank space or as an entity unto itself is a purely metaphysical question and does not affect the taste of the doughnut one bit.","One foot in front of the other. Repeat as often as necessary to finish.","And her sleep was too long and deep for that:so deep that she left her normal reality behind.","As long as you have the courage to admit mistakes, things can be turned around.","I don\'t think jealousy has much of a connection with real, objective conditions. Like if you\'re fortunate you\'re not jealous, but if life hasn\'t blessed you, you are jealous. Jealousy doesn\'t work that way. It\'s more like a tumor secretly growing inside us that gets bigger and bigger, beyond all reason. Even if you find out it\'s there, there\'s nothing you can do to stop it.","All over the world people have developed their own ideas about what\'s right and wrong in life, but so long as you aren\'t harming others or the Earth, it\'s your choice when you decide how you want to live your life - Yours and yours alone. Life\'s no piece of cake, mind you, but the recipe\'s my own to fool with.","If you do anything out of the ordinary, you can be sure someone, somewhere, will get upset.","Irrepressible curiosity vied with an instinctive fear.","Maybe working on the little things as dutifully and honestly as we can is how we stay sane when the world is falling apart.","I happen to like the strange ones. People who look normal and leads normal lives - they\'re the ones you have to watch out for.","Time flows in a strange way on Sundays.","Now all you can do is wait. It must be hard for you, but there is a right time for everything. Like the ebb and flow of tides. No one can do anything to change them. When it is time to wait, you must wait.","To be able to talk to your heart\u2019s content about a book you like with someone who feels the same way about it is one of the greatest joys that life can offer.","Here, too, a brand-new day is beginning. It could be a day like all the others, or it could be a day remarkable enough in many ways to remain in the memory. In either case, for now, for most people, it is a blank sheet of paper.","Understanding\' is merely the sum total of our misunderstandings.","I stare at her chest. As she breathes, the rounded peaks move up and down like the swell of waves, somehow reminding me of rain falling softly on a broad stretch of sea. I\'m the lonely voyager standing on deck, and she\'s the sea. The sky is a blanket of gray, merging with the gray sea off on the horizon. It\'s hard to tell the difference between sea and sky. Between voyager and sea. Between reality and the workings of the heart.","I\u2019m the kind of person who likes to be by himself. To put a finer point on it, I\u2019m the type of person who doesn\u2019t find it painful to be alone. I find spending an hour or two every day running alone, not speaking to anyone, as well as four or five hours alone at my desk, to be neither difficult nor boring. I\u2019ve had this tendency ever since I was young, when, given a choice, I much preferred reading books on my own or concentrating on listening to music over being with someone else. I could always think of things to do by myself.","Start making excuses and there\'s no end to it. I can\'t live that kind of life.","Mental acuity was never born from comfortable circumstances.","I\'m all alone, but I\'m not lonely.","Dreams come from the past, not from the future. Dreams shouldn\'t control you--you should control them.","If I have left a wound inside you, it is not just your wound but mine as well.","Everyone, deep in their hearts, is waiting for the end of the world to come.","Closing your eyes isn\'t going to change anything. Nothing\'s going to disappear just because you can\'t see what\'s going on. In fact, things will even be worse the next time you open your eyes. That\'s the kind of world we live in. Keep your eyes wide open. Only a coward closes his eyes. Closing your eyes and plugging up your ears won\'t make time stand still.","It\'s hard to tell the difference between sea and sky, between voyager and sea. Between reality and the workings of the heart.","Don\'t feel sorry for yourself. Only arseholes do that.","I don\'t care what you do to me, but I don\'t want you to hurt me. I\'ve had enough hurt already in my life. More than enough. Now I want to be happy.","What\'s nurtured slowly grows well.","Reality was utterly coolheaded and utterly lonely.","My very existence, my life in the world, seemed like a hallucination. A strong wind would make me think my body was about to be blown to the end of the earth, to some land I had never seen or heard of, where my mind and body would separate forever. \u201cHold tight,\u201d I would tell myself, but there was nothing for me to hold on to.","There was just one moon. That familiar, yellow, solitary moon. The same moon that silently floated over fields of pampas grass, the moon that rose--a gleaming, round saucer--over the calm surface of lakes, that tranquilly beamed down on the rooftops of fast-asleep houses. The same moon that brought the high tide to shore, that softly shone on the fur of animals and enveloped and protected travelers at night. The moon that, as a crescent, shaved slivers from the soul--or, as a new moon, silently bathed the earth in its own loneliness. THAT moon.","You always look so cool, like no matter what happens, it\u2019s got nothing to do with you, but you\u2019re not really like that. In your own way, you\u2019re out there fighting as hard as you can, even if other people can\u2019t tell by looking at you.","Even chance meetings are the result of karma\u2026 Things in life are fated by our previous lives. That even in the smallest events there\u2019s no such thing as coincidence.","What makes us the most normal,\\" said Reiko, \\"is knowing that we\'re not normal.","I want to believe you, but if that\'s true, I just don\'t get it. Why does loving somebody mean you have to hurt them just as much? I mean, if that\'s the way it goes, what\'s the point of loving someone?","That\u2019s how stories happen \u2014 with a turning point, an unexpected twist. There\u2019s only one kind of happiness, but misfortune comes in all shapes and sizes. It\u2019s like Tolstoy said. Happiness is an allegory, unhappiness a story.","Inside that darkness, i saw rain falling on the sea. Rain softly falling on a vast sea, with no one there to see it. The rain strikes the surface of the sea, yet even the fish don\'t know it is raining.","We\'re all kind of weird and twisted and drowning.","Whiskey, like a beautiful woman, demands appreciation. You gaze first, then it\'s time to drink.","Nobody\'s going to win all the time. On the highway of life you can\'t always be in the fast lane.","Nobody\'s easier to fool, than the person who is convinced that he is right.","Time flows in strange ways on Sundays, and sights become mysteriously distorted.","They were each like a mirror for the other, reflecting the changes in themselves.","I\'m scared,\\" she said. \\"These days I feel like a snail without a shell.\\" \\"I\'m scared too,\\" I said. \\"I feel like a frog without any webs.\\" She looked up and smiled. Wordlessly we walked over to a shaded part of the building and held each other and kissed, a shell-less snail and a webless frog.","Have you ever had that feeling\u2014that you\u2019d like to go to a whole different place and become a whole different self?","The sky grew darker, painted blue on blue, one stroke at a time, into deeper and deeper shades of night.","There are three ways you can get along with a girl: one, shut up and listen to what she has to say; two, tell her you like what she\'s wearing; and three, treat her to really good food...If you do all that and still don\'t get the results you want, better give up.","It was as if I were writing letters to hold together the pieces of my crumbling life.","People need routines. It\'s like a theme in music. But it also restrictsyour thoughts and actions and limits your freedom. It structures your priorities and in some cases distorts your logic.","We\'re both looking at the same moon, in the same world. We\'re connected to reality by the same line. All I have to do is quietly draw it towards me.","Sometimes you\u2019re just the sweetest thing. Like Christmas, summer vacation, and a brand-new puppy rolled into one.","I want you always to remember me. Will you remember that I existed, and that I stood next to you here like this?","Although I didn\'t think so at the time, things were a lot simpler in 1969. All you had to do to express yourself was throw rocks at riot police. But with today\'s sophistication, who\'s in a position to throw rocks? Who\'s going to brave what tear gas? C\'mon, that\'s the way it is. Everything is rigged, tied into that massive capital web, and beyond this web there\'s another web. Nobody\'s going anywhere. You throw a rock and it\'ll come right back at you.","What if I\u2019ve forgotten the most important thing? What if somewhere inside me there is a dark limbo where all the truly important memories are heaped and slowly turning into mud?...the thought fills me with an almost unbearable sorrow.","No matter what form the relationship might take, he was the only person she could picture sharing her life with.","I\'m not so weird to me.","Most everything you think you know about me is nothing more than memories.","But I didn\'t understand then. That I could hurt somebody so badly she would never recover. That a person can, just by living, damage another human being beyond repair.","In a sense, I\'m the one who ruined me: I did it myself.","Become like a sheet of blotting paper and soak it all in. Later on you can figure out what to keep and what to unload.","I\'m going to take you out of here ... I\'m going to take you home, to the world where you belong, where cats with bent tails live, and there are little backyards, and alarm clocks ring in the morning.","No matter how much suffering you went through, you never wanted to let go of those memories.","Such wounds to the heart will probably never heal. But we cannot simply sit and stare at our wounds forever.","There are ways of dying that don\'t end in funerals. Types of death you can\'t smell.","Of what value is a civilization that can\'t toast a piece of bread as ordered?","She\'s letting out her feelings. The scary thing is not being able to do that. When your feelings build up and harden and die inside, then you\'re in big trouble.","Anyone who falls in love is searching for the missing pieces of themselves. So anyone who\'s in love gets sad when they think of their lover. It\'s like stepping back inside a room you have fond memories of, one you haven\'t seen in a long time.","When I was little, I had this science book. There was a section on \'What would happen to the world if there was no friction?\' Answer: \'Everything on earth would fly into space from the centrifugal force of revolution.\' That was my mood.","There are some things about myself I can\u2019t explain to anyone. There are some things I don\u2019t understand at all. I can\u2019t tell what I think about things or what I\u2019m after. I don\u2019t know what my strengths are or what I\u2019m supposed to do about them. But if I start thinking about these things in too much detail the whole thing gets scary. And if I get scared I can only think about myself. I become really self-centered, and without meaning to, I hurt people. So I\u2019m not such a wonderful human being.","Sometimes I get real lonely sleeping with you.","The strength I\'m looking for isn\'t the type where you win or lose. I\'m not after a wall that\'ll repel power coming from outside. What I want us the kind of strength to be able to absorb that kind of power, to stand up to it.The strength to quietly endure things - unfairness, misfortunes, sadness, mistakes, misunderstandings.","No mistake about it. Ice is cold; roses are red; I\'m in love. And this love is about to carry me off somewhere. The current\'s too overpowering; I don\'t have any choice. It may very well be a special place, some place I\'ve never seen before. Danger may be lurking there, something that may end up wounding me deeply, fatally. I might end up losing everything. But there\'s no turning back. I can only go with the flow. Even if it means I\'ll be burned up, gone forever.","People fall in love without reason, without even wanting to. You can\'t predict it. That\'s love.","Kindness and a caring mind are two separate qualities. Kindness is manners. It is superficial custom, an acquired practice. Not so the mind. The mind is deeper, stronger, and, I believe, it is far more inconstant.","I was always hungry for love. Just once, I wanted to know what it was like to get my fill of it -- to be fed so much love I couldn\'t take any more. Just once.","In everybody\u2019s life there\u2019s a point of no return. And in a very few cases, a point where you can\u2019t go forward anymore. And when we reach that point, all we can do is quietly accept the fact. That\u2019s how we survive.","You got to know your limits. Once is enough, but you got to learn. A little caution never hurt anyone. A good woodsman has only one scar on him. No more, no less.","I was reduced to pure concept. My flesh had dissolved; my form had dissipated. I floated in space. Liberated of my corporeal being, but without dispensation to go anywhere else.I was adrift in the void. Somewhere across the fine line separating nightmare from reality.","All I do is keep on running in my own cozy, homemade void, my own nostalgic silence. And this is a pretty wonderful thing. No matter what anybody else says.","In dreams begins responsiblities.","I think you still love me, but we can\u2019t escape the fact that I\u2019m not enough for you. I knew this was going to happen. So I\u2019m not blaming you for falling in love with another woman. I\u2019m not angry, either. I should be, but I\u2019m not. I just feel pain. A lot of pain. I thought I could imagine how much this would hurt, but I was wrong.","Will you wait for me forever?","What I feel for her is a wholly different emotion. It stands and walks on its own, living and breathing and throbbing and shaking me to the roots of my being.","Your heart is like a great river after a long spell of rain, spilling over its banks. All signposts that once stood on the ground are gone, inundated and carried away by that rush of water. And still the rain beats down on the surface of the river. Every time you see a flood like that on the news you tell yourself: That\u2019s it. That\u2019s my heart.","Unfortunately, the clock is ticking, the hours are going by. The past increases, the future recedes. Possibilities decreasing, regrets mounting.","Holding this soft, small living creature in my lap this way, though, and seeing how it slept with complete trust in me, I felt a warm rush in my chest. I put my hand on the cat\'s chest and felt his heart beating. The pulse was faint and fast, but his heart, like mine, was ticking off the time allotted to his small body with all the restless earnestness of my own.","If you miss the bus, miss the train, you\u2019d be left behind. So everyone says, let\u2019s get on the train, let\u2019s get on the bus and go faster and get rich... I just didn\u2019t like that kind of lifestyle. I love to read books, to listen to music.","The body is not the only target of rape. Violence does not always take a visible form, and not all wounds gush blood.","Between the time the last train leaves and the first train arrives, the place changes: it\'s not the same as in daytime.","A certain something, he felt, had managed to work its way in through a tiny opening and was trying to fill a blank space inside him. The void was not one that she had made. It had always been there inside him. She had merely managed to shine a special light on it.","We heard no other sounds. We met no other people. We saw only two bright red birds leap startled from the center of the meadow and dart into the woods.","I think of rivers, of tides. Forests and water gushing out. Rain and lightning. Rocks and shadows. All of these are in me.","It\'s because of you when I\'m in bed in the morning that I can wind my spring and tell myself I have to live another good day.","It\'s all matter of attitude. You could let a lot of things bother you if you wanted to But it\'s pretty much the same anywhere you go, you can manage.","Our responsibility begins with our imagination.","Being active every day makes it easier to hear that inner voice.","For example, the wind has its reasons. We just don\'t notice as we go about our lives. But then, at some point, we are made to notice. The wind envelops you with a certain purpose in mind, and it rocks you. The wind knows everything that\'s inside you. And not just the wind. Everything, including a stone. They all know us very well. From top to bottom. It only occurs to us at certain times. And all we can do is go with those things. As we take them in, we survive, and deepen.","Some things in life are too complicated to explain in any language.","Friends don\'t need the intervention of a third party. Friendship\'s a voluntary thing.","Overhead, the two moons worked together to bathe the world in a strange light.","Each of us possesses a tangible living soul. The system has no such thing. We must not allow the system to exploit us.","I don\'t know, there\'s something about you. Say there\'s an hourglass: the sand\'s about to run out. Someone like you can always be counted on to turn the thing over.","The most important thing we learn at school is the fact that the most important things can\'t be learned at school.","Some things are forgotten, some things disappear, some things die.","But even so, every now and then I would feel a violent stab of loneliness. The very water I drink, the very air I breathe, would feel like long, sharp needles. The pages of a book in my hands would take on the threatening metallic gleam of razor blades. I could hear the roots of loneliness creeping through me when the world was hushed at four o\'clock in the morning.","It\'s easy to forget things you don\'t need anymore.","Death is not the opposite of life, but a part of it.","Those were strange days, now that I look back at them. In the midst of life, everything revolved around death.","For a certain kind of person, love begins from something tiny or silly. From something like that or it doesnt begin at all.","Letters are just pieces of paper,\\" I said. \\"Burn them, and what stays in your heart will stay; keep them, and what vanishes will vanish.","Everything was too sharp and clear, so that I could never tell where to start- the way a map that shows too much can sometimes be useless.","No matter where i go, i still end up me. What\'s missing never changes. The scenery may change, but i\'m still the same incomplete person. The same missing elements torture me with a hunger that i can never satisfy. I think that lack itself is as close as i\'ll come to defining myself.","Everybody has to start somewhere. You have your whole future ahead of you. Perfection doesn\'t happen right away.","How can the mind be so imperfect?\\" she says with a smile. I look at my hands. Bathed in the moonlight, they seem like statues, proportioned to no purpose. \\"It may well be imperfect,\\" I say, \\"but it leaves traces. And we can follow those traces, like footsteps in the snow.\\" \\"Where do the lead?\\" \\"To oneself,\\" I answer. \\"That\'s where the mind is. Without the mind, nothing leads anywhere.\\" I look up. The winter moon is brilliant, over the Town, above the Wall. \\"Not one thing is your fault,\\" I comfort her.","But the silence spoke volumes.","He does not exist here, with me, but flesh that does not exist will never die, and promises unmade are never broken.","No matter how much time passes, no matter what takes place in the interim, there are some things we can never assign to oblivion, memories we can never rub away.","When someone is trying very hard to get something, they don\'t. And when they\'re running away from something as hard as they can, it usually catches up with them.","Don\u2019t you see? You and he might never cross paths again. Of course, a chance meeting could occur, and I hope it happens. I really do, for your sake. But realistically speaking, you have to see there\u2019s a huge possibility you\u2019ll never be able to meet him again. And even if you do meet, he might already be married to somebody else. He might have two kids. Isn\u2019t that so? And in that case, you may have to live the rest of your life alone, never being joined with the one person you love in all the world. Don\u2019t you find that scary?","There\'s no war that will end all wars.","I am a flawed human being - a far more flawed human being than you realize.","Life doesn\'t require ideals. It requires standards of action.","Maybe the only thing I can definitely say about is this: That\u2019s life. Maybe the only thing we can do is accept it, without really knowing what\u2019s going on.","What you see with your eyes is not necessarily real.","My imagination is a kind of animal. So what I do is keep it alive.","The better you were able to imagine what you wanted to imagine, the farther you could flee from reality.","Isn\'t life strange? There are people who have so many leftover clothes they can\'t stuff them all in their wardrobe. And then there are people like me, whose socks never match.","We were, the two of us, still fragmentary beings, just beginning to sense the presence of an unexpected, to be-aquired reality that would fill us and make us whole.","Why do I act like this, agreeing when I really disagree, letting people force me to do things I don\'t want to do?","Lost opportunities, lost possibilities, feelings we can never get back. That\'s part of what it means to be alive. But inside our heads - at least that\'s where I imagine it - there\'s a little room where we store those memories. A room like the stacks in this library. And to understand the workings of our own heart we have to keep on making new reference cards. We have to dust things off every once in awhile, let in fresh air, change the water in the flower vases. In other words, you\'ll live forever in your own private library.","The silence grew deeper, so deep that if you listened carefully you might very well catch the sound of the earth revolving on its axis.","That\'s what the world is , after all: an endless battle of contrasting memories.","Sometimes I feel so- I don\u2019t know - lonely. The kind of helpless feeling when everything you\u2019re used to has been ripped away. Like there\u2019s no more gravity, and I\u2019m left to drift in outer space with no idea where I\u2019m going\u2019 Like a little lost Sputnik?\u2019 I guess so.","I\'m tired of living unable to love anyone. I don\'t have a single friend - not one. And, worst of all, I can\'t even love myself. Why is that? Why can\'t I love myself? It\'s because I can\'t love anyone else. A person learns how to love himself through the simple acts of loving and being loved by someone else. Do you understand what I am saying? A person who is incapable of loving another cannot properly love himself.","Learning another language is like becoming another person.","Constipation was one of the things she hated most in the world, on par with despicable men who commit domestic violence and narrow-minded religious fundamentalists.","It is not that the meaning cannot be explained. But there are certain meanings that are lost forever the moment they are explained in words.","What do you think? I\'m not a starfish or a pepper tree. I\'m a living, breathing human being. Of course I\'ve been in love.","It\u2019s pretty thin, the wall separating healthy confidence and unhealthy Pride.","Narrow minds devoid of imagination. Intolerance, theories cut off from reality, empty terminology, usurped ideals, inflexible systems. Those are the things that really frighten me. What I absolutely fear and loathe.","Of course it hurt that we could never love each other in a physical way. We would have been far more happy if we had. But that was like the tides, the change of seasons--something immutable, an immovable destiny we could never alter. No matter how cleverly we might shelter it, our delicate friendship wasn\'t going to last forever. We were bound to reach a dead end. That was painfully clear.","That\'s how people live in the real world: forcing stuff on each other.","The fresh smell of coffee soon wafted through the apartment, the smell that separates night from day.","I feel like I\'ve swallowed a cloudy sky","I wonder what ants do on rainy days?","A deserted library in the morning - there\'s something about it that really gets to me. All possible words and ideas are there, resting peacefully.","\\"They tell us that the only thing we have to fear is fear itself, but I don\'t believe that.\\" he said. Then, a moment later, he added: \\"Oh, the fear is there, all right. It comes to us in many different forms, at different times, and overwhelms us. But the most frightening thing we can do at such times is to turn our backs on it, to close our eyes. For then we take the most precious thing inside us and surrender it to something else. In my case, that something was the wave.\\"","Reading was like an addiction; I read while I ate, on the train, in bed until late at night, in school, where I\'d keep the book hidden so I could read during class. Before long I bought a small stereo and spent all my time in my room, listening to jazz records. But I had almost no desire to talk to anyone about the experience I gained through books and music. I felt happy just being me and no one else. In that sense I could be called a stack-up loner.","If you never noticed, it never happened.","Memories and thoughts age, just as people do. But certain thoughts can never age, and certain memories can never fade.","People want to be bowled over by something special. Nine times out of ten you might strike out, but that tenth time, that peak experience, is what people want. That\'s what can move the world. That\'s art.","How many times have you said, \'This is it. I\'ve finally found my one true love\'? And how many times has the reality turned out differently? Paperback romances and fairy tales promote an ideal of a first and only love, but few of us can claim to have had such uncomplicated good fortune. For most people, the process of finding the perfect partner is one trial and error: breakups, makeups, missed opportunities and misunderstandings. Human love is a fragile creation, and sometimes the smallest thing - the wrong choice of words or a single clumsy gesture - can make love shatter, stall or fade away.","People sometimes sneer at those who run every day, claiming they\'ll go to any length to live longer. But don\'t think that\'s the reason most people run. Most runners run not because they want to live longer, but because they want to live life to the fullest.","What the world needs is a set villain that people can point at and say, \u201cIt\u2019s all your fault!","She curled up and pressed her cheek against his chest. Her ear was right above his heart. She was listening to his thoughts. \\"I need to know this,\\" Aomame said. \\"That we\'re in the same world, seeing the same things.","You can keep as quiet as you like, but one of these days somebody is going to find you.","Pain is inevitable. Suffering is optional. Say you\u2019re running and you think, \u2018Man, this hurts, I can\u2019t take it anymore. The \u2018hurt\u2019 part is an unavoidable reality, but whether or not you can stand anymore is up to the runner himself.","My shadow is only half of what it should be.\\" \\"Everyone has their shortcomings.","I never could stand being forced to do something I didn\'t want to do at a time I didn\'t want to do it. Whenever I was able to do something I liked to do, though, when I wanted to do it, and the way I wanted to do it, I\'d give it everything I had.","How much do you love me?\' Midori asked. \'Enough to melt all the tigers in the world to butter,\' I said.","Memory is like fiction; or else it\'s fiction that\'s like memory. This really came home to me once I started writing fiction, that memory seemd a kind of fiction, or vice versa. Either way, no matter how hard you try to put everything neatly into shape, the context wanders this way and that, until finally the context isn\'t even there anymore... Warm with life, hopeless unstable.","As long as I was alive, I was something. That was just how it was. But somewhere along the way it all changed. Living turned me into nothing.","There are many things we only see clearly in retrospect.","If you want everything to be nice and straight all the time, then go live in a world made with a triungular ruler.","In most cases learning something essential in life requires physical pain.","In order to pin down reality as realilty, we need another reality to relativize the first. Yet that other reality requires a third reality to serve as its grounding. An endless chain is created within our consciousness, and it is the maintenance of this chain which produces the sensation that we are actually here, that we ourselves exist.","I learned that realism can come in all shapes and sizes. The world is big enough for different values to coexist.","Nobody likes being alone that much. I don\'t go out of my way to make friends, that\'s all. It just leads to disappointment.","No one could say how long that life would last. Whatever has form can disappear in an instant.","As if to build a fence around the fatal emptiness inside her, she had to create a sunny person that she became. But if you peeled away the ornamental egos that she had built, there was only an abbys of nothingness and the intense thirst that came with it. Though she tried to forget it, the nothingness would visit her periodically - on a lonely rainy afternoon, or at dawn when she woke up from a nightmare. What she needed at such times was to be held by someone, anyone.","\\"Between a high, solid wall and an egg that breaks against it, I will always stand on the side of the egg.\\"\\n\\nYes, no matter how right the wall may be and how wrong the egg, I will stand with the egg. Someone else will have to decide what is right and what is wrong; perhaps time or history will decide. If there were a novelist who, for whatever reason, wrote works standing with the wall, of what value would such works be?","I don\'t go out of my way to make friends, that\'s all.","It feels good to think about you when I\'m warm in bed. I feel as if you\'re curled up there beside me, fast asleep. And I think how great it would be if it were true.","Loneliness becomes an acid that eats away at you.","Once thing goes wrong, then the whole house of cards collapses. And there\'s no way you can extricate yourself. Until someone comes along to drag you out.","If you think God\u2019s there, He is. If you don\u2019t, He isn\u2019t. And if that\u2019s what God\u2019s like, I wouldn\u2019t worry about it.","What a terrible thing it is to wound someone you really care for and to do it so unconsciously.","I go by the gut. I might not appear to have any talent but I\'ve got plenty of gut instinct.","I am here, alone, at the end of the world. I reach out and touch nothing.\u201d.","It\'s a dark, cool, quiet place. A basement in your soul. And that place can sometimes be dangerous to the human mind. I can open the door and enter that darkness, but I have to be very careful. I can find my story there. Then I bring that thing to the surface, into the real world.","Wasn\'t it better if they kept this desire to see each other hidden within them, and never actually got together? That way, there would always be hope in their hearts. That hope would be a small, yet vital flame that warmed them to their core-- a tiny flame to cup one\'s hands around and protect from the wind, a flame that the violent winds of reality might easily extinguish.","Even so, there were times I saw freshness and beauty. I could smell the air, and I really loved rock \'n\' roll. Tears were warm, and girls were beautiful, like dreams. I liked movie theaters, the darkness and intimacy, and I liked the deep, sad summer nights.","Exerting yourself to the fullest within your individual limits: that\'s the essence of running, and a metaphor for life","Possibilities are like cancer. The more I think about them, the more they multiply, and there\'s no way to stop them. I\'m out of control.","When it\'s all over, it\'ll seem like a dream.","There\'s a special feeling you get on a veranda that you just can\'t get anywhere else.","I didn\'t want to be a writer, but I became one. And now I have many readers, in many countries. I think that\'s a miracle. So I think I have to be humble regarding this ability. I\'m proud of it and I enjoy it, and it is strange to say it this way, but I respect it.","I was feeling lonely without her, but the fact that I could feel lonely at all was consolation. Loneliness wasn\'t such a bad feeling. It was like the stillness of the pin oak after the little birds had flown off.","He felt as if his heart had dried up. I needed her he thought. I needed someone like her to fill the void inside me. But I wasn\u2019t able to fill the void inside her. Until the bitter end, the emptiness inside her was hers alone.","The answer is dreams. Dreaming on and on. Entering the world of dreams and never coming out. Living in dreams for the rest of time.","Kumiko and I felt something for each other from the beginning. It was not one of those strong, impulsive feelings that can hit two people like an electric shock when they first meet, but something quieter and gentler, like two tiny lights traveling in tandem through a vast darkness and drawing imperceptibly closer to each other as they go. As our meetings grew more frequent, I felt not so much that I had met someone new as that I had chanced upon a dear old friend.","A friend to kill time is a friend sublime.","That\'s why I like listening to Schubert while I\'m driving. Like I said, it\'s because all his performances are imperfect. A dense, artistic kind of imperfection stimulates your consciousness, keeps you alert. If I listen to some utterly perfect performance of an utterly perfect piece while I\'m driving, I might want to close my eyes and die right then and there. But listening to the D major, I can feel the limits of what humans are capable of - that a certain type of perfection can only be realized through a limitless accumulation of the imperfect. And personally I find that encouraging.","\\"I guess I\'ve been waiting so long I\'m looking for perfection. That makes it tough.\\" \\n\\"Waiting for perfect love?\\" \\n\\"No, even I know better than that. I\'m looking for selfishness. Like, say I tell you I want to eat strawberry shortcake. And you stop everything you\'re doing and run out and buy it for me. And you come back out of breath and get down on your knees and hold this strawberry shortcake out to me. And I say I don\'t want it anymore and throw it out the window. That\'s what I\'m looking for.\\"","It\'s like Tolstoy said. Happiness is an allegory, unhappiness a story.","Everybody has some one thing they do not want to lose,\\" began the man. \\"You included. And we are professionals at finding out that very thing. Humans by necessity must have a midway point between their desires and their pride. Just as all objects must have a center of gravity. This is something we can pinpoint. Only when it is gone do people realize it even existed.","Our hearts are not stones. A stone may disintegrate in time and lose its outward form. But hearts never disintegrate. They have no outward form, and whether good or evil, we can always communicate them to one another.","He was silent for thirty seconds, maybe a minute. I uncrossed my legs under the table and wondered if this was the right moment to leave. It was as if my whole life revolved around trying to judge the right point in a conversation to say goodbye.","The light of morning decomposes everything.","The pillow smells like the sunlight, a precious smell.","How wonderful it is to be able to write someone a letter! To feel like conveying your thoughts to a person, to sit at your desk and pick up a pen, to put your thoughts into words like this is truly marvelous.","Spending plenty of time on something can be the most sophisticated form of revenge.","Things like that happen all the time in this great big world of ours. It\'s like taking a boat out on a beautiful lake on a beautiful day and thinking both the sky and the lake are beautiful. So stop eating yourself up alive. Things will go where they\'re supposed to go if you just let them take their natural course.","Can\'ttrustpeople. Won\'tdoanygood. They\'llkillyoueverytime. They\'llkilleachother. They\'llkilleveryone.","There had to be something wrong with my life. I should have been born a Yugoslavian shepherd who looked up at the Big Dipper every night.","You don\u2019t get it, do you?\\" I said. \u201cIt\u2019s not a question of \u2018what then\u2019. Some people get a kick out of reading railroad timetables and that\u2019s all they do all day. Some people make huge model boats out of matchsticks. So what\u2019s wrong if there happens to be one guy in the world who enjoys trying to understand you?","There were plenty of women around who dressed smartly, and plenty more who dressed to impress, but this girl was different. Totally different. She wore her clothing with such utter naturalness and grace that she could have been a bird that had wrapped itself in a special wind as it made ready to fly off to another world. He had never seen a woman who wore her clothes with such apparent joy. And the clothes themselves looked as if, in being draped on her body, they had won new life for themselves.","I\'m a coward when it comes to matters of the heart. That is my fatal flaw.","Please think of me like an endangered species and just observe me quietly from far away. If you try to talk to me or touch me casually, I may get intimidated and bite you. So please be careful.","She was hearing everything that went on in his heart, like a person who can trace a map with his fingertip and conjure up vivid, living scenery.","An unhealthy soul requires a healthy body.","Life is not like water. Things in life don\'t necessarily flow over the shortest possible route.","Your work should be an act of love, not a marriage of convenience.","What I think is this: You should give up looking for lost cats and start searching for the other half of your shadow.","But this thing, whatever it was, this mistlike something, hung there inside my body like a certain kind of potential. I wanted to give it a name, but the word refused to come to mind. I\u2019m terrible at finding the right words for things. I\u2019m sure Tolstoy would have been able to come up with exactly the right word","Then she took my hand and touched it to the wound beside her eye. I caressed the half-inch scar. As I did so, the waves of her consciousness pulsed through my fingertips and into me - a delicate resonance of longing. Probably someone should take this girl in his arms and hold her tight, I thought. Probably someone other than me. Someone qualified to give her something. \\"Goodbye, Mr. Wind-Up Bird. See you again sometime.","People with dark souls have nothing but dark dreams. People with really dark souls do nothing but dream.","There has to be pain. That\'s the rule.","Life is here, death is over there. I am here, not over there.","Nothing in the real world is as beautiful as the illusions of a person about to lose consciousness.","Is it possible to become friends with a butterfly?","But who can say what\'s best? That\'s why you need to grab whatever chance you have of happiness where you find it, and not worry about other people too much. My experience tells me that we get no more than two or three such chances in a life time, and if we let them go, we regret it for the rest of our lives.","When a writer develops a story, he is confronted with a poison that is inside him. If you don\'t have that poison, your story will be boring and uninspired. It\'s like fugu: The flesh of the pufferfish is extremely tasty, but the roe, the liver, the heart can be lethally toxic.","The Earth, time, concepts, love, life, faith justice, evil - they\'re all fluid and in transition. They don\'t stay in one form or in one place forever. The whole universe is like some big FedEx box.","Not just beautiful, though \u2014 the stars are like the trees in the forest, alive and breathing. And they\u2019re watching me. What I\u2019ve up till now, what I\u2019m going to do \u2014 they know it all. Nothing gets past their watchful eyes. As I sit there under the shining night sky, again a violent fear takes hold of me. My heart\u2019s pounding a mile a minute, and I can barely breathe. All these millions of stars looking down on me, and I\u2019ve never given them more than a passing thought before. Not just the stars \u2014 how many other things haven\u2019t I noticed in the world, things I know nothing about?","We fell silent again. The thing we had shared was nothing more than a fragment of time that had died longe ago.Even so, a faint glimmer of that warm memory still claimed a part of my heart. And when death claim me, no doubt I would walk along by that faint light in the brief instant before being flung once again into the abyss of nothingness","You end up exhausted and spent, but later, in retrospect, you realize what it all was for. The parts fall into place, and you can see the whole picture and finally understand the role each individual part plays. The dawn comes, the sky grows light, and the colors and shapes of the roofs of houses, which you could only glimpse vaguely before, come into focus.","When I open them, most of the books have the smell of an earlier time leaking out between the pages - a special odor of the knowledge and emotions that for ages have been calmly resting between the covers. Breathing it in, I glance through a few pages before returning each book to its shelf.","Our memory is made up of our individual memories and our collective memories. The two are intimately linked. And history is our collective memory. If our collective memory is taken from us - is rewritten - we lose the ability to sustain our true selves.","That\u2019s what love\u2019s all about. You\u2019re the only one having those wonderful feelings, but you have to go it alone as you wander through the dark your mind and body have to bear it all. All by yourself.","I wasn\'t in love with her. And she didn\'t love me. For me the question of love was irrelevant. What I sought was the sense of being tossed about by some raging, savage force, in the midst of which lay something absolutely crucial. I had no idea what that was. But I wanted to thrust my hand right inside her body and touch it, whatever it was.","She\'s always polite and kind, but her words lack the kind of curiosity and excitement you\'d normally expect. Her true feelings- assuming such things exist- remain hidden away. Except for when a practical sort of decision has to be made, she never gives her personal opinion about anything. She seldom talks about herself, instead letting others talk, nodding warmly as she listens. But most people start to feel vaguely uneasy when talking with her, as if they suspect they\'re wasting her time, trampling on her private, graceful, dignified world. And that impression is, for the most part, correct.","Silence. How long it lasted, I couldn\'t tell. It might have been five seconds, it might have been a minute. Time wasn\'t fixed. It wavered, stretched, shrank. Or was it me that wavered, stretched, and shrank in the silence? I was warped in the folds of time, like a reflection in a fun house mirror.","The world in books seemed so much more alive to me than anything outside. I could see things I\'d never seen before. Books and music were my best friends. I had a couple of good friends at school, but never met anyone I could really speak my heart to. We\'d just make small talk, play soccer together. When something bothered me, I didn\'t talk with anyone about it. I thought it over all by myself, came to a conclusion, and took action alone. Not that I really felt lonely. I thought that\'s just the way things are. Human beings, in the final analysis, have to survive on their own.","The good thing about writing books is that you can dream while you are awake. If it\u2019s a real dream, you cannot control it. When writing the book, you are awake; you can choose the time, the length, everything. I write for four or five hours in the morning and when the time comes, I stop. I can continue the next day. If it\u2019s a real dream, you can\u2019t do that.","What we see before us is just one tiny part of the world. We get in the habit of thinking, this is the world, but that\'s not true at all. The real world is a much darker and deeper place than this, and much of it is occupied by jellyfish and things.","A certain type of perfection can only be realized through a limitless accumulation of the imperfect.","Killing time is not an easy job.","I keep to this routine every day without variation. The repetition itself becomes the important thing; it\'s a form of mesmerism. I mesmerize myself to reach a deeper state of mind.","I don\'t want our relationship to end like this. You\'re one of the very few friends I have, and it hurts not being able to see you. When am I going to be able to talk to you? I want you to tell me that much, at least.","Then when dusk began to settle he would retrace his steps, back to his own world. And on the way home, a loneliness would always claim his heart. He could never quite get a grip on what it was. It just seemed that whatever lay waiting \\"out there\\" was all too vast, too overwhelming for him to possibly ever make a dent in.","We never choose anything at all. Things happen. Or not.","And so they parted, she to the east, and he to the west. The test they had agreed upon, however, was utterly unnecessary. They should never have undertaken it, because they really and truly were each other\'s 100% perfect lovers, and it was a miracle that they had ever met. But it was impossible for them to know this, young as they were. The cold, indifferent waves of fate proceeded to toss them unmercifully.","Gays, lesbians, straights, feminists, fascist pigs, communists, Hare Krishnas - none of them bother me. I don\'t care what banner they raise. But what I can\'t stand are hollow people. When I\'m with them I just can\'t bare it, and wind up saying things I shouldn\'t.","Confidence; as a teenager? Because I knew what I loved. I loved to read; I loved to listen to music; and I love cats. Those three things. So, even though I was an only kid, I could be happy because I knew what I loved.","Losing you is most difficult for me, but the nature of my love for you is what matters. If it distorts into half-truth, then perhaps it is better not to love you. I must keep my mind but loose you.","Music brings a warm glow to my vision, thawing mind and muscle from their endless wintering.","Listening to the music while stretching her body close to its limit, she was able to attain a mysterious calm. She was simultaneously the torturer and the tortured, the forcer and the forced. This sense of inner-directed self-sufficiency was what she wanted most of all. It gave her deep solace.","Beyond the edge of the world there\u2019s a space where emptiness and substance neatly overlap, where past and future form a continuous, endless loop. And, hovering about, there are signs no one has ever read, chords no one has ever heard.","Colours shone with exceptional clarity in the rain. The ground was a deep black, the pine branches a brilliant green, the people wrapped in yellow looking like special spirits that were allowed to wander over the earth on rainy mornings only.","Between a high, solid wall and an egg that breaks against it, I will always stand on the side of the egg.","Until the bitter end, the emptiness inside her was hers alone.","I may not be the most likable person in the world, but I try not to upset people.","There weren\'t any curtains in the windows, and the books that didn\'t fit into the bookshelf lay piled on the floor like a bunch of intellectual refugees.","The pure present is an ungraspable advance of the past devouring the future. In truth, all sensation is already memory.","Not just beautiful, though--the stars are like the trees in the forest, alive and breathing. And they\'re watching me.","Chance encounters are what keep us going.","I get irritated, I get upset. Especially when I\'m in a hurry. But I see it all as part of our training. To get irritated is to lose our way in life.","Writers have to keep on writing if they want to mature, like caterpillars endlessly chewing on leaves.","You know what I think?\\" she says. \\"That people\'s memories are maybe the fuel they burn to stay alive. Whether those memories have any actual importance or not, it doesn\'t matter as far as the maintenance of life is concerned. They\'re all just fuel. Advertising fillers in the newspaper, philosophy books, dirty pictures in a magazine, a bundle of ten-thousand-yen bills: when you feed \'em to the fire, they\'re all just paper.","This is no honky-tonk parade. 1Q84 is the real world, where a cut draws real blood, where pain is real pain and fear is real fear. The moon in the sky is no paper moon.","Every day I go to my study and sit at my desk and put the computer on. At that moment, I have to open the door. It\'s a big, heavy door. You have to go into the Other Room. Metaphorically, of course. And you have to come back to this side of the room. And you have to shut the door.","Some people think literature is high culture and that it should only have a small readership. I don\'t think so... I have to compete with popular culture, including TV, magazines, movies and video games.","I move, therefore I am.","You\u2019re here,\u201d I continued. \u201cAt least you look as if you\u2019re here. But maybe you aren\u2019t. Maybe it\u2019s just your shadow. The real you may be someplace else. Or maybe you already disappeared, a long, long time ago. I reach out my hand to see, but you\u2019ve hidden yourself behind a cloud of probablys. Do you think we can go on like this forever?","I would never see her again, except in memory. She was here, and now she\'s gone. There is no middle ground. Probably is a word that you may find south of the border. But never, ever west of the sun.","I like to read books. I like to listen to music.","When I start to write, I don\'t have any plan at all. I just wait for the story to come.","The library was like a second home. Or maybe more like a real home, more than the place I lived in. By going every day I got to know all the lady librarians who worked there. They knew my name and always said hi. I was painfully shy, though, and could barely reply.","Like most novelists, I like to do exactly the opposite of what I\'m told. It\'s in my nature as a novelist. Novelists can\'t trust anything they haven\'t seen with their own eyes or touched with their own hands.","I\'m often asked what I think about as I run. Usually the people who ask this have never run long distances themselves. I always ponder the question. What exactly do I think about when I\'m running? I don\'t have a clue.","You know what I\'d really like to do the most right now? Climb up to the top of some high place like the pyramids. The highest place I can find. Where you can see forever. Stand on the very top, look all around the world, see all the scenery, and see with my own eyes what\'s been lost from the world.","You\'ve already decided what you\'re going to do, and all that\'s left is to set the wheels in motion. I mean, it\'s your life. Basically, you gotta go with what you think is right.","I\'m a very ordinary human being; I just happen to like reading books.","A story is not something of this world. A real story requires a kind of magical baptism to link the world on this side with the world on the other side.","You like to write. It\'s the single most important quality for someone who wants to be a writer. But not in itself enough.","Death leaves cans of shaving cream half-used.","The passage of time will usually extract the venom of most things and render them harmless","Everything in life is a metaphor.","I could disappear from the face of the earth, and the world would go on moving without the slightest twinge. Things were tremendously complicated, to be sure, but one thing was clear: no one needed me.","For me, writing a novel is like having a dream. Writing a novel lets me intentionally dream while I\'m still awake. I can continue yesterday\'s dream today, something you can\'t normally do in everyday life.","With luck, it might even snow for us.","I didn\'t have much to say to anybody but kept to myself and my books. With my eyes closed, I would touch a familiar book and draw it\'s fragrance deep inside me. This was enough to make me happy.","Generally, people who are good at writing letters have no need to write letters. They\'ve got plenty of life to lead inside their own context.","The point is, not to resist the flow. You go up when you\'re supposed to go up and down when you\'re supposed to go down. When you\'re supposed to go up, find the highest tower and climb to the top. When you\'re supposed to go down, find the deepest well and go down to the bottom. When there\'s no flow, stay still. If you resist the flow, everything dries up. If everything dries up, the world is darkness.","When I write about a 15-year old, I jump, I return to the days when I was that age. It\'s like a time machine. I can remember everything. I can feel the wind. I can smell the air. Very actually. Very vividly.","At my core, there is nothing. Neither is it parched wastelands. At my core, there is love. I\'ll go on loving that ten-year-old boy named Tengo forever --- his strength, his intelligence, his kindness. He does not exist here, with me, but flesh that does not exist will never die, and promises unmade are never broken.","If you want to talk about something new, you have to make up a new kind of language.","Love and used Subarus were two different things. Weren\'t they?","The best way to think about reality, I had decided, was to get as far away from it as possible.","Living like an empty shell is not really living, no matter how many years it may go on. The heart and flesh of an empty shell give birth to nothing more than the life of an empty shell.","A regular wind-up toy world this is, I think. Once a day the wind-up bird has to come and wind the springs of this world. Alone in this fun house, only I grow old, a pale softball of death swelling inside me. Yet even as I sleep somewhere between Saturn and Uranus, wind-up birds everywhere are busy at work fulfilling their appointed rounds.","But intolerant,narrow minds with no imagination are like parasites that transform the host,change form,and continue to thrive. They\'re a lost cause, and I don\'t want anyone like that coming in here.","Sometimes fate is like a small sandstorm that keeps changing directions. You change direction but the sandstorm chases you. You turn again, but the storm adjusts.","People soon get tired of things that aren\'t boring, but not of what is boring.","No matter what the situation may be, I still take pleasure in witnessing the joy of others.","ice contains no future , just the past, sealed away. As if they\'re alive, everything in the world is sealed up inside, clear and distinct. Ice can preserve all kinds of things that way- cleanly, clearly. That\'s the essence of ice, the role it plays.","Maybe she thought the garbage and rocks in your head were interesting. But finally, garbage is garbage and rocks are rocks.","You might think you made a new world or a new self, but your old self is always gonna be there, just below the surface, and if something happens, it\'ll stick its head out and say \'Hi.\' You don\'t seem to realize that. You were made somewhere else.","As with marathon runs and lengths of toilet paper, there had to be standards to measure up to.","But if something did happen, it happened. Whether it\'s right or wrong. I accept everything that happens, and that\'s how I became the person I am now.","But actually time isn\'t a straight line. It doesn\'t ave a shape. In all senses of the term, it doesn\'t have any form. But since we can\'t picture something without form in our minds, for the sake of convenience we understand it as a straight line. At this point, humans are the only ones who can make that sort of conceptual substitution.","I realize full well how hard it must be to go on living alone in a place from which someone has left you, but there is nothing so cruel in this world as the desolation of having nothing to hope for.","There\'s not much you can do about time - it just keeps on passing. But experience? Don\'t tell me that. I\'m not proud of it, but I don\'t have any sexual desire. And what sort of experience can a writer have if she doesn\'t feel passion? It\'d be like a chef without an appetite.","I wonder how it turns out that we all lead such different lives. Take you and your sister, for example. You\'re born to the same parents, you grow up in the same household, you\'re both girls. How do you end up with such wildly different personalities?...One puts on a bikini like little semaphore flags and lies by the pool looking sexy, and the other puts on her school bathing suit and swims her heart out like a dolphin.","Like flowers scattered in a storm, a man\'s life is a long farewell.","Pointless thinking is worse than no thinking at all.","We all die and disappear, but that\'s because the mechanism of the world itself is built on destruction and loss.","Most human activities are predicated on the assumption that life goes on. If you take that premise away, what is there left?","The rain that fell on the city runs down the dark gutters and empties into the sea without even soaking the ground","Was it Aristotle who said the human soul is composed of reason, will, and desire?\u201d \u201cNo, that was Plato. Aristotle and Plato were as different as Mel Torm\xe9 and Bing Crosby. In any case, things were a lot simpler in the old days,\u201d Komatsu said. \u201cWouldn\u2019t it be fun to imagine reason, will, and desire engaged in a fierce debate around a table?","People are drawn deeper into tragedy not by their defects but by their virtues.","The ocean was one of the greatest things he had ever seen in his life\u2014bigger and deeper than anything he had imagined. It changed its color and shape and expression according to time and place and weather. It aroused a deep sadness in his heart, and at the same time it brought his heart peace and comfort.","Love with complications. Scenery was the last thing on my mind.","you mean machines are like humans?\\" I shook my head. \\"No, not like humans. With machines the feeling is, well, more finite. It doesn\'t go any further. With humans it\'s different. The feeling is always changing. Like if you love somebody, the love is always shifting or wavering. It\'s always questioning or inflating or disappearing or denying or hurting. And the thing is, you can\'t do anything about it, you can\'t control it. With my Subaru, it\'s not so complicated.","It made her think of Laika, the dog. The man-made satellite streaking soundlessly across the blackness of outer space. The dark, lustrous eyes of the dog gazing out the tiny window. In the infinite loneliness of space, what could the dog possibly be looking at?","George Orwell is half journalist, half fiction writer. I\'m 100 percent fiction writer... I don\'t want to write messages. I want to write good stories. I think of myself as a political person, but I don\'t state my political messages to anybody.","Not everything was lost in the flow of time","As I already explaned, I don\'t have any form. I\'m a conceptual metaphysical object.","My biggest faults is that the faults I was born with grow bigger each year. It\'s like I was raising chickens inside me. The chickens lay eggs and the eggs hatch into other chickens, which then lay eggs. Is this any way to live a life? What with all these faults I\'ve got going, I have to wonder. Sure, I get by. But in the end, that\'s not the question, is it?","Her partially open lips now opened wide, and her soft, fragrant tongue entered his mouth, where it began a relentless search for unformed words, for a secret code engraved there. Tengo\'s own tongue responded unconsciously to this movement and soon their tongues were like two young snakes in a spring meadow, newly wakened from their hibernation and hungrily intertwining, each led on by the other\'s scent.","I dream. Sometimes I think that\u2019s the only right thing to do. To dream, to live in the world of dreams. But it doesn\u2019t last forever. Wakefulness always comes to take me back.","Lots of different ways to live and lots of different ways to die. But in the end that doesn\'t make a bit of difference. All that remains is a desert.","When the fire goes out, you\'ll start feeling the cold. You\'ll wake up whether you want to or not.","I realize now that the reality of things is not something you convey to people but something you make.","You said that the mind is like the wind but perhaps it is we who are like the wind Knowing nothing, simply blowing through. Never aging, never dying.","What was lost was lost. There was no retrieving it, however you schemed, no returning to how things were, no going back.","Math is like water. It has a lot of difficult theories, of course, but its basic logic is very simple. Just as water flows from high to low over the shortest possible distance, figures can only flow in one direction. You just have to keep your eye on them for the route to reveal itself. That\u2019s all it takes. You don\u2019t have to do a thing. Just concentrate your attention and keep your eyes open, and the figures make everything clear to you. In this whole, wide world, the only thing that treats me so kindly is math.","Once you let yourself grow close to someone, cutting the ties could be painful.","What do you mean, \'playing really creatively\'? Can you give me an example?\\" \\"Hmm, let\'s see ... you send the music deep enough into your heart so that it makes your body undergo a kind of a physical shift, and simultaneously the listener\'s body also undergoes the same kind of physical shift. It\'s giving birth to that kind of shared state. Probably.","When you are used to the kind of life -of never getting anything you want- you stop knowing what it is you want.","The ground we stand on looks solid enough, but if something happens it can drop right out from under you.","To keep on going, you have to keep up the rhythm.","In dreams you don\'t need to make any distinctions between things. Not at all. Boundaries don\'t exist. So in dreams there are hardly ever collisions. Even if there are, they don\'t hurt. Reality is different. Reality bites. Reality, reality.","Shakespeare said it best,\' Tamaru said quietly as he gazed at that lumpish, misshapen head. \'Something along these lines: if we die today, we do not have to die tomorrow, so let us look to the best in each other","If I stayed here, something inside me would be lost forever\u2014something I couldn\'t afford to lose. It was like a vague dream, a burning, unfulfilled desire. The kind of dream people have only when they\'re seventeen.","There\'s no sense forcing yourself if you don\'t feel like it. Tell you the truth, I\'ve had sex with lots of guys, but I think I did it mostly out of fear. I was scared not to have somebody putting his arms around me, so I could never say no. That\'s all. Nothing good ever came of sex like that. All it does is grind down the meaning of life a piece at a time.","One impossible day, of an impossible month, of an impossible year.","Thinking about spaghetti that boils eternally but is never done is a sad, sad thing.","It doesn\u2019t matter how old I get, but as long as I continue to live I\u2019ll always discover something new about myself.","I am nothing. I\u2019m like someone who\u2019s been thrown into the ocean at night, floating all alone. I reach out, but no one is there. I call out, but no one answers. I have no connection to anything.","My father always told me: \'Give somebody a hand and he\'ll take an arm.","Everytime you see a flood like that on the news you tell yourself: That\'s it. That\'s my heart.","Don\'t pointless things have a place, too, in this far-from-perfect world? Remove everything pointless from an imperfect life, and it\'d lose even its imperfection.","Each person feels pain in his own way, each has his own scars.","You know what I should do?\\" Hoshino asked excited. \\"Of course,\\" the cat said. \\"What\'d I tell you? Cats know everything. Not like dogs.","It is sometimes necessary for each person. Fill up with delicious food, get drunk, sing loudly and chat frivolously.","Knowledge and ability were tools, not things to show off.","Have books \u2018happened\u2019 to you? Unless your answer to that question is \u2018yes,\u2019 I\u2019m unsure how to talk to you","In Japan they prefer the realistic style. They like answers and conclusions, but my stories have none. I want to leave them wide open to every possibility. I think my readers understand that openness.","So that\'s how we live our lives. No matter how deep and fatal the loss, no matter how important the thing that\'s stolen from us--that\'s snatched right out of our hands--even if we are left completely changed, with only the outer layer of skin from before, we continue to play out our lives this way, in silence. We draw ever nearer to the end of our allotted span of time, bidding it farewell as it trails off behind. Repeating, often adroitly, the endless deeds of the everyday. Leaving behind a feeling of immeasurable emptiness.","You can see a person\'s whole life in the cancer they get.","I would stare at the grains of light suspended in that silent space, struggling to see into my own heart. What did I want? And what did others want from me? But I could never find the answers. Sometimes I would reach out and try to grasp the grains of light, but my fingers touched nothing.","But what seems like a reasonable distance to one person might feel too far to somebody else.","Everyone just keeps on disappearing. Some things vanish, like they were cut away. Others fade slowly into the mist. And all that remains is a desert.","A gentleman is someone who does not what he wants to do, but what he should do.","Only the dead stay seventeen forever.","What we seek is some kind of compensation for what we put up with.","The most dangerous creature here would have to be me. So maybe I\'m just scared of my own shadow.","With each passing moment I\'m becoming part of the past. There is no future for me, just the past steadily accumulating.","Distance might not solve anything, no matter how far you run.","Where there is light, there must be shadow, where there is shadow there must be light. There is no shadow without light and no light without shadow.... We do not know if the so-called Little People are good or evil. This is, in a sense, something that surpasses our understanding and our definitions. We have lived with them since long, long ago-- from a time before good and evil even existed, when people\'s minds were still benighted.","What we call the present is given shape by an accumulation of the past.","The sense of tragedy - according to Aristotle - comes, ironically enough, not from the protagonist\'s weak points but from his good qualities. Do you know what I\'m getting at? People are drawn deeper into tragedy not by their defects but by their virtues. ... [But] we accept irony through a device called metaphor. And through that we grow and become deeper human beings.","So the fact that I\u2019m me and no one else is one of my greatest assets. Emotional hurt is the price a person has to pay in order to be independent.","People leave strange little memories of themselves behind when they die.","Even castles in the sky can do with a fresh coat of paint.","As long as there\'s such a thing as time, everybody\'s damaged in the end, changed into something else. It always happens, sooner or later.","I\'ll write to you. A super-long letter, like in an old-fashioned novel","She lived frugally, but her meals were the only things on which she deliberately spent her money. She never compromised on the quality of her groceries, and drank only good-quality wines.","There\'s no such thing as perfect writing, just like there\'s no such thing as perfect despair.","I collect records. And cats. I don\'t have any cats right now. But if I\'m taking a walk and I see a cat, I\'m happy.","To know one\u2019s own state is not a simple matter. One cannot look directly at one\u2019s own face with one\u2019s own eyes, for example. One has no choice but to look at one\u2019s reflection in the mirror. Through experience, we come to believe that the image is correct, but that is all.","Suicides? Heart attacks? The papers didn\'t seem interested. The world was full of ways to die, too many to cover. Newsworthy deaths had to be exceptional. Most people go unobserved.","You\'re afraid of imagination and even more afraid of dreams. Afraid of the resposibility that begins in dreams. But you have to sleep and dreams are a part of sleep. When you\'re awake you can suppress imagination but you can\'t supress dreams.","Someone who can search for something is happy. Searching gives a meaning to life. Nowadays it\u2019s not so easy to find something you might be looking for. The most important thing, however, is the search itself, the way you take. It\u2019s not so important where it leads. that\u2019s why my characters are always looking for something, maybe only a cat, a sheep or a wife, but that is at least the beginning of a story.","I didn\'t feel like I was in my own body; my body was just a lonely, temporary container I happened to be borrowing.","It\'s a question of attitude. If you really work at something you can do it up to a point. If you really work at being happy you can do it up to a point. But anything more than that you can\'t. Anything more than that is luck.","If you listen to the radio for a whole hour there\'s maybe one decent song. The rest is mass-produced garbage","Then I noticed that my shadow was crying too, shedding clear, sharp shadow tears. Have you ever seen the shadows of tears, Mr. Wind-Up Bird? They\u2019re nothing like ordinary shadows. Nothing at all. They come here from some other, distant world, especially for our hearts. Or maybe not. It struck me then that the tears my shadow was shedding might be the real thing, and the tears that I was shedding were just shadows. You don\u2019t get it, I\u2019m sure, Mr. Wind-Up Bird. When a naked seventeen-year-old girl is shedding tears in the moonlight, anything can happen. It\u2019s true.","Taking crazy things seriously is a serious waste of time.","I\'m in no position to hand down any advice,\\" he said, \\"but there\'s a rule I follow when I don\'t know what to do.\\" \\"A rule?\\" \\"If you have to choose between something that has form and something that doesn\'t, go for the one without form. That\'s my rule. Whenever I run into a wall I follow that rule, and it always works out. Even if it\'s hard going at the time.","Properly speaking, should any individual ever have exact, clear knowledge of his own core consciousness?\\" \\"I wouldn\'t know,\\" I said. \\"Nor would we,\\" said the scientists.","Strange and mysterious things, though, aren\'t they - earthquakes? We take it for granted that the earth beneath our feet is solid and stationary. We even talk about people being \'down to earth\' or having their feet firmly planted on the ground. But suddenly one day we see that it isn\'t true. The earth, the boulders, that are supposed to be solid, all of a sudden turn as mushy as liquid - From the short story \\"Thailand","I don\'t really know if it\'s the right thing to do, making new life. Kids grow up, generations take their place. What does it all come to? More hills bulldozed and more ocean fronts filled in? Faster cars and more cats run over? Who needs it?","Everyone may be ordinary, but they\'re not normal.","If they invent a car that runs on stupid jokes, you could go far.","I tell lies sometimes. The last time I lied was a year ago. I absolutely detest lying. You could say that lying and silence are the two greatest sins of present day society. Actually, I lie a lot, and I\'m always clamming up.","Mediocrity\'s like a spot on a shirt\u2014it never comes off.","I closed my eyes and listened carefully for the descendants of Sputnik, even now circling the earth, gravity their only tie to the planet. Lonely metal souls in the unimpeded darkness of space, they meet, pass each other, and part, never to meet again. No words passing between them. No promises to keep.","From the girl who sat before me now...surged a fresh and physical life force. She was like a small animal that has popped into the world with the coming of spring. Her eyes moved like an independent organism with joy, laughter, anger, amazement, and despair. I hadn\'t seen a face so vivid and expressive in ages, and I enjoyed watching it live and move.","What we needed were not words and promises but a steady accumulation of small realities.","We each have a special something we can get only at a special time of our life. like a small flame. A careful, fortunate few cherish that flame, nurture it, hold it as a torch to light their way. But once that flame goes out, it\u2019s gone forever.","The thoughts that occur to me while I\u2019m running are like clouds in the sky. Clouds of all different sizes. They come and they go, while the sky remains the same sky always. The clouds are mere guests in the sky that pass away and vanish, leaving behind the sky.","Painful is the stress when one cannot reproduce or convey vividly to others, however hard he tries, what he\'s experienced so intensely.","Once a guy starts using a wig, he has to keep using one. It\'s, like, his fate. That\'s why wig makers make such huge profits. I hate to say it, but they\'re like drug dealers.","Is it against the law for me to know it?","My peak? Would I even have one? I hardly had had anything you could call a life. A few ripples, some rises and falls. But that\'s it. Almost nothing. Nothing born of nothing. I\'d loved and been loved, but I had nothing to show. It was a singularly plain, featureless landscape. I felt like I was in a video game. A surrogate Pacman, crunching blindly through a labyrinth of dotted lines. The only certainty was my death.","In traveling, a companion, in life, compassion.","Tell me, Doctor, are you afraid of death?\\" \\"I guess it depends on how you die.","Curiosity can bring guts out of hiding at times, maybe even get them going. But curiosity usually evaporates. Gust have to go for the long haul. Curiosity\'s like a fun friend you can\'t really trust. It turns you on and then it leaves you to make it on your own - with whatever guts you can muster","Time, of course, topples everyone in its path equally- the way that driver beats his old horse until it dies. But the thrashing we receive is one of frightful gentleness. Few of us even realize that we are being beaten.","An empty shell. Those were the first words that sprang to mind. .... Something incredibly important - .. - had disappeared from Miu for good. Leaving behind not life, but its absence","Was the earth put here just to nourish human loneliness?","I never trust people with no appetite. It\'s like they\'re always holding something back on you.","Time is too conceptual. Not that it stops us from filling it in. So much so, we can\'t even tell whether our experiences belong to time or to the world of physical things.","Hatred is like a long, dark shadow. Not even the person it falls upon knows where it comes from, in most cases. It is like a two-edged sword. When you cut the other person, you cut yourself. The more violently you hack at the other person, the more violently you hack at yourself. It can often be fatal. But it is not easy to dispose of. Please be careful, Mr.Okada. It is very dangerous. Once it has taken root in your heart, hatred is the most difficult think in the world to shake off.","Whenever an occasion arose in which she needed an opinion on something in the wider world, she borrowed her husband\'s. If this had been all there was to her, she wouldn\'t have bothered anyone, but as is so often the case with such women, she suffered from an incurable case of of pretentiousness. Lacking any internalized values of her own, such people can arrive at a standpoint only by adopting other people\'s standards or views. The only principle that governs their minds is the question \\"How do I look?","But why should you be interested in me?\\" Good question. I can\u2019t explain it myself right this moment. But maybe \u2013 just maybe \u2013 if we start getting together and talking, after a while something like Francis Lai\u2019s soundtrack music will start playing in the background, and a whole slew of concrete reasons why I\u2019m interested in you will line up out of nowhere. With luck, it might even snow for us.","Were the stars out when I left the house last evening? All I could remember was the couple in the Skyline listening to Duran Duran. Stars? Who remembers stars? Come to think of it, had I even looked up at the sky recently? Had the stars been wiped out of the sky three months ago, I wouldn\u2019t have known.","It depends on which reality you take and which reality I take.\u201d (p. 318).","This may be the most important proposition revealed by history: At the time, no one knew what was coming.","Time really is one big continuous cloth, no? We habitually cut out pieces of time to fit us, so we tend to fool ourselves into thinking that time is our size, but it really goes on and on.","It seems to me, though, that you always understand very well what I can\'t say very well. Trouble is I end up being even worse at saying things well.","I wasn\'t particularly afraid of death itself. As Shakespeare said, die this year and you don\'t have to die the next.","It\'s like the Tibetan Wheel of the Passions. As the wheel turns, the values and feelings on the outer rim rise and fall, shining or sinking into darkness. But true love stays fastened to the axle and doesn\'t move.","Nakata\'s empty inside... Do you know what it means to be completely empty? Being empty is like a vacant house. An unlocked, vacant house. Anybody can come in, anytime they want. That\'s what scares me the most","It\'s basically impossible for everybody\'s justice to prevail or everybody\'s happiness to triumph, so chaos takes over.","Life\'s no piece of cake, mind you, but the recipe\'s my own to fool with.","Whatever can\'t be expressed might as well not exist.","Stories lie deep in our souls. Stories lie so deep at the bottom of our hearts that they can bring people together on the deepest level. When I write a novel, I go into such depths.","I think memory is the most important asset of human beings. It\'s a kind of fuel; it burns and it warms you. My memory is like a chest: There are so many drawers in that chest, and when I want to be a fifteen-year-old boy, I open up a certain drawer and I find the scenery I saw when I was a boy in Kobe. I can smell the air, and I can touch the ground, and I can see the green of the trees. That\'s why I want to write a book.","I think history is collective memories. In writing, I\'m using my own memory, and I\'m using my collective memory.","Do you know what \u2018Sputnik\u2019 means in Russian? \u2018Travelling companion\u2019. I looked it up in a dictionary not long ago. Kind of a strange coincidence if you think about it. I wonder why the Russians gave their satellite that strange name. It\u2019s just a poor little lump of metal, spinning around the Earth.","My point is: in this whole wide world the only person you can depend on is you.","Certain kinds of knowledge rob people of their sleep.","Two-thirds of earth\'s surface is ocean, and all we can see with the naked eye is the surface.","If, as the dowager had said, we are nothing but gene carriers, why do so many of us have to lead such strangely shaped lives? Wouldn\'t our genetic purpose-to transmit DNA-be served just as well if we lived simple lives, not bothering our heads with a lot of extraneous thoughts, devoted entirely to preserving life and procreating? Did it benefit the genes in any way for us to lead such intricately warped, even bizarre, lives?","Sometimes we don\'t need words. Rather, it\'s words that need us.","In ancient times, people weren\'t just male or female, but one of three types: male/male, male/female, female/female. In other words, each person was made out of the components of two people. Everyone was happy with this arrangement and never really gave it much a thought. But then God took a knife and cut everybody in half, right down the middle. So after that the world was divided just into male and female, the upshot being that people spend their time running around trying to locate their missing other half.","If we reverse the outer shell and the essence--in other words, consider the outer shell the essence and the essence only the shell--our lives might be a whole lot easier to understand.","Ever since time began (when was that, I wonder?), it\'s been moving ever forward without a moment\'s rest. And one of the privileges given to those who\'ve avoided dying young is the blessed\\nright to grow old.","You can hide as cleverly as you like, but in the final analysis mimicry is deception, pure and simple. It doesn\'t solve a thing.","...I\'ve just been feeling insecure since I was 20, and that\'s all I\'ve been trying to express. Now the entire world is feeling insecure.","Rousseau defined civilizations as when people build fences.","It\'s a terrible thing when a person dies, whatever the circumstances. A hole opens up in the world, and we need to pay the proper respects. If we don\'t, the hole will never be filled in again.","Things can be seen better in the darkness,\\" he said, as if he had just seen into her mind. \\"But the longer you spend in the dark, the harder it becomes to return to the world aboveground where the light is","A theory is a battlefield in your head.","Let the world move along as it pleased. If it had any business with him, it would be sure to tell him.","If a person remains tense for a long time he might not notice it himself, but it\u2019s like his nerves are a piece of rubber that has been stretched out. It\u2019s hard to go back to the original shape.","In this world, there is no absolute good, no absolute evil,\\" the man said. \\"Good and evil are not fixed, stable entities, but are continually trading places. A good may be transformed into an evil in the next second. And vice versa. Such was the way of the world that Dostoevsky depicted in The Brothers Karamazov. The most important thing is to maintain the balance between the constantly moving good and evil. If you lean too much in either direction, it becomes difficult to maintain actual morals. Indeed, balance itself is the good.","They take the circuits out of people\u2019s brains that make it possible for them to think for themselves. Their world is like the one that George Orwell depicted in his novel. I\u2019m sure you realize that there are plenty of people who are looking for exactly that kind of brain death. It makes life a lot easier. You don\u2019t have to think about difficult things, just shut up and do what your superiors tell you to do.","Someone once said that nothing costs more and yields less benefit than revenge,\u201d Aomame said. \u201cWinston Churchill. As I recall it, though, he was making excuses for the British Empire\u2019s budget deficits. It has no moral significance.","Either I\'m funny or the world\'s funny. I don\'t know which. The bottle and lid don\'t fit. It could be the bottle\'s fault or the lid\'s fault. In either case, there\'s no denying that the fit is bad.","And as the years have passed, the time has grown longer. The sad truth is that what I could recall in five seconds all too needed ten, then thirty, then a full minute - like shadows lengthening at dusk. Someday, I suppose, the shadows will be swallowed up in darkness.","I\'ve been lonely for so long. And I\'ve been hurt so deeply. If only I could have met you again a long time ago, then I wouldn\'t have had to take all these detours to get here.\' Tengo shook his head. \'I don\'t think so. This way is just fine. This is exactly the right time. For both of us. [...] We needed that much time.... to understand how lonely we really were.","To be able to grasp something of value, sometimes you have to perform seemingly inefficient acts.","Ordinary imperfect people, always choose similarly imperfect people as friends.","Listen - God only exists in people\'s minds. Especially in Japan, God\'s always been kind of a flexible concept. Look at what happened after the war. Douglas MacArthur ordered the divine emperor to quit being God, and he did, making a speech saying he was just an ordinary person. So after 1946 he wasn\'t God anymore. That\'s what Japanese gods are like--they can be tweaked and adjusted. Some American comping on a cheap pipe gives the order and presto change-o--God\'s no longer God. A very postmodern kind of thing. If you think God\'s there, He is. If you don\'t, He isn\'t.","Still, in the end, we all die just the same.","Even if you don\'t acknowledge it, people die, and guys sleep with girls. That\'s just how it is.","You can have tons of talent, but it won\'t necessarily keep you fed. If you have sharp instincts, through, you\'ll never go hungry.","When you\'re young, you think you can handle anything. By the time you find out otherwise, it\'s already too late. You got a stocking wrapped around your neck.","The world would be a pretty dull place if it were made up only of the first-rate, right?","Sometimes we don\'t need words. Rather, it\'s words that need us. If we were no longer here, words would lose their whole function. They would end up as words that are never spoken, and words that aren\'t spoken are no longer words. - (Where I\'m Likely To Find It)","I hurt myself deeply, though at the time I had no idea how deeply. I should have learned many things from that experience, but when I look back on it, all I gained was one single, undeniable fact. That ultimately I am a person who can do evil. I never consciously tried to hurt anyone, yet good intentions notwithstanding, when necessity demanded, I could become completely self-centred, even cruel. I was the kind of person who could, using some plausible excuse, inflict on a person I cared for a wound that would never heal.","Who can really distinguish between the sea and what\'s reflected in it? Or tell the difference between the falling rain and loneliness?","Passion can\u2019t sustain itself forever.","You\'re not a kid any more. You have the right to choose your own life. You can start again. If you want a cat, all you have to do is choose a life in which you can have a cat. It\'s simple. It\'s your right.","But I found that the longer you teach, the more you feel like a total stranger to yourself","It\'s just like sex; when [a book is] finished, it\'s finished.","Not that running away\'s going to solve everything. I don\'t want to rain on your parade or anything, but I wouldn\'t count on escaping this place if I were you. No matter how far you run. Distance might not solve anything.","You are 27 or 28 right? It is very tough to live at that age. When nothing is sure. I have sympathy with you.","My arm was not what she needed, but the arm of someone else. My warmth was not what she needed, but the warmth of someone else.","The sad truth is that certain types of things can\'t go backward. Once they start going forward, no matter what you do, they can\'t go back the way they were. If even one little thing goes awry, then that\'s how it will stay forever.","Those five fingers and that palm were like a display case crammed full of everything I wanted to know--and everything I had to know. By taking my hand, she showed me what these things were. That within the real world, a place like this existed. In the space of those ten seconds I became I tiny bird, fluttering in the air, the wind rushing by. From high in the sky I could see a scene far away. It was so far off I couldn\'t make it out clearly, yet something was there, and I knew that someday I would travel to that place.","I\'m kind of a low-key guy. The spotlight doesn\'t suit me. I\'m more of a side dish--cole slaw or French fries or a Wham! backup singer.","For a while\\" is a phrase whose length can\'t be measured.At least by the person who\'s waiting.","A short story I have written long ago would barge into my house in the middle of the night, shake me awake and shout, \'Hey,this is no time for sleeping! You can\'t forget me, there\'s still more to write!\' Impelled by that voice, I would find myself writing a novel. In this sense, too, my short stories and novels connect inside me in a very natural, organic way.","My short stories are like soft shadows I have set out in the world, faint footprints I have left. I remember exactly where I set down each and every one of them, and how I felt when I did. Short stories are like guideposts to my heart.","Fairness is a concept that holds only in limited situations. Yet we want the concept to extend to everything, in and out of phase. From snails to hardware stores to married life. Maybe no one finds it, or even misses it, but fairness is like love. What is given has nothing to do with what we seek.","If writing novels is like planting a forest, then writing short stories is more like planting a garden.","Whenever she felt like crying, she would instead become angry\u2014at someone else or at herself\u2014which meant that it was rare for her to shed tears.","Is this what it means to go back to square one? Most likely. He had nothing left to lose, other than his life.","To sleep with a woman: it can seem of the utmost importance in your mind, or then again it can seem like nothing much at all. Which only goes to say that there\'s sex as therapy (self-therapy, that is) and there\'s sex as pastime.","When there\'s nothing to do, you do nothing slowly and intently.","What would tomorrow bring? I wondered. Both hands on the wheel, I closed my eyes. I didn\u2019t feel like I was in my own body; my body was just a lonely, temporary container I happened to be borrowing. What would become of me tomorrow I did not know.","It\'s good when food tastes good, it\'s kind of like proof you\'re alive.","The good thing about writing book is that you can dream while you are awake.","What I saw wasn\'t a ghost. It was simply--myself. I can never forget how terrified I was that night, and whenever I remember it, this thought always springs to mind: that the most frightening thing in the world is our own self. What do you think?","Autumn finally arrived. And when it did, I came to a decision. Something had to give: I couldn\'t keep on living like this.","Sometimes taking time is actually a shortcut.","Mere humans who root through their refrigerators at three o\'clock in the morning can only produce writing that matches what they do. And that includes me.","My father belongs to the generation that fought the war in the 1940s. When I was a kid my father told me stories - not so many, but it meant a lot to me. I wanted to know what happened then, to my father\'s generation. It\'s a kind of inheritance, the memory of it.","Since I have come to America, I am often asked whether my next novel will be set in America. I don\'t think it will. I think I will be living in America for some time to come, but while living in America, I would like to write about Japanese society from the outside.","Sometimes I wonder why I\'m a novelist right now. There is no definite career reason why I became a writer. Something happened, and I became a writer. And now I\'m a successful writer.","I don\'t know -- maybe the world has two different kinds of people, and for one kind the world is this completely logical, rice pudding place, and for the other it\'s all hit-or-miss macaroni gratin.","I\'ll never see them again. I know that. And they know that. And knowing this, we say farewell.","I began to draw an invisible boundary between myself and other people. No matter who I was dealing with. I maintained a set distance, carefully monitoring the person\u2019s attitude so that they wouldn\u2019t get any closer. I didn\u2019t easily swallow what other people told me. My only passions were books and music","Life is so uncertain: you never know what could happen. One way to deal with that is to keep your pajamas washed.","It\'s not me but the world that\'s deranged.","When you see runners in town is easy to distinguish beginners from veterans. The ones panting are beginners; the ones with quiet, measured breathing are the veterans. Their hearts, lost in thought, slowly tick away time. When we pass each other on the road, we listen to the rhythm of each other\'s breathing, and sense the way the other person is ticking away the moments.","Most runners run not because they want to live longer, but because they want to live life to the fullest.","Not to excuse myself, but when you have people right in front of you denying your very presence like that, then see if you don\'t doubt whether you actually exist. I look at my hands half expecting to see clear through them.","My heroes don\'t have anything special. They have something to tell other people but they don\'t know how, so they talk to themselves.","I get up early in the morning, 4 o\'clock, and I sit at my desk and what I do is just dream. After three or four hours, that\'s enough. In the afternoon, I run.","If you\'re young and talented, it\'s like you have wings.","So this was how secrets got started, I thought to myself. People constructed them little by little.","Some things, you know, if you say them, it makes them not true?","If you try to use your head to think about things, people don\'t want to have anything to do with you","That\'s all I think about these days. Must be because I have so much time to kill every day. When you don\'t have anything to do, your thoughts get really, really far out - so far out you can\'t follow them all the way to the end.","You\'re wrong. The mind is not like raindrops. It does not fall from the skies, it does not lose itself among other things. If you believe in me at all, then believe this: I promise you I will find it. Everything depends on this.\\" \\"I believe you,\\" she whispers after a moment. \\"Please find my mind.","Death was not the opposite of life. It was already here, within my being, it had always been here, and no struggle would permit me to forget that.","I\'ve never met a girl who thinks like you.\\" \\"A lot of people tell me that,\\" she said, digging at a cuticle. \\"But it\'s the only way I know how to think. Seriously. I\'m just telling you what I believe. It\'s never crossed my mind that my way of thinking is different from other people\'s. I\'m not trying to be different. But when I speak out honestly, everybody thinks I\'m kidding or playacting. When that happens, I feel like everything is such a pain!","Memory is like fiction; or else it\'s fiction that\'s like memory.","It\'s true though: time moves in its own special way in the middle of the night,\\" the bartender says, loudly striking a book match and lighting a cigarette. \\"You can\'t fight it.","If you really want to know what\'s happening here and now, you\'ve got to use your own eyes and your own judgment.","When the orbits of these two satellites of ours happened to cross paths, we could be together. Maybe even open our hearts to each other. But that was only for the briefest moment. In the next instant we\'d be in absolute solitude. Until we burned up and became nothing.","Understanding is but the sum of misunderstandings.","Listen up\u2014there\u2019s no war that will end all wars,\u2019 Crow tells me. \u2018War breeds war. Lapping up the blood shed by violence, feeding on wounded flesh. War is a perfect, self-contained being. You need to know that.","Only people who have been discriminated against can really know how much it hurts. Each person feels the pain in his own way, each has his own scars. So I think I\'m as concerned about fairness and justice as anybody. But what disgusts me even more are people who have no imagination. The kind T. S. Elliot calls \'hollow men\'. People who fill up that lack of imagination with heartless bits of straw, not even aware of what they\'re doing. Callous people who throw a lot of empty words at you, trying to force you to do what you don\'t want to.","That\'s what we all do: endlessly take the long way around.","My priority is my books, at least at this point. What I have to do is write the narrative of this time.","As a novelist, you could say that I am dreaming while I am awake, and every day I can continue with yesterday\'s dream. Because it is a dream, there are so many contradictions and I have to adjust them to make the story work. But, in principle, the original dream does not change.","I myself have been on my own and utterly independent since I graduated. I haven\'t belonged to any company or any system. It isn\'t easy to live like this in Japan.","For novelists or musicians, if they really want to create something, they need to go downstairs and find a passage to get into the second basement. What I want to do is go down there, but still stay sane.","Far away, I could hear them lapping up my brains. Like Macbeth\'s witches, the three lithe cats surrounded my broken head, slurping up that thick soup inside. The tips of their rough tongues licked the soft folds of my mind. And with each lick my consciousness flickered like a flame and faded away.","Crying is personal. On the other hand, laughing is more general . Laughing makes our hearts wider.","I could have been a cult writer if I\'d kept writing surrealistic novels. But I wanted to break into the mainstream, so I had to prove that I could write a realistic book.","I just wanted to write something about running, but I realized that to write about my running is to write about my writing. It\'s a parallel thing in me.","I started writing at the kitchen table after midnight. It took ten months to finish that first book; I sent it to a publisher and I got some kind of prize, so it was like a dream - I was surprised to find it happening.","I try not to think about anything special while running. As a matter of fact, I usually run with my mind empty. However, when I run empty-minded, something naturally and abruptly crawls in sometime. That might become an idea that can help me with my writing.","I was enjoying myself writing, because I don\'t know what\'s going to happen when I take a ride around that corner. You don\'t know at all what you\'re going to find there. That can be thrilling when you read a book, especially when you\'re a kid and you\'re reading stories.","In Japan, the writers have made up a literary community, a circle, a society. I think 90 percent of Japan\'s writers live in Tokyo. Naturally, they make a community. There are groups and customs, and so they are tied up in a way.","It\'s true that at the time I was fond of Kurt Vonnegut and Richard Brautigan, and it was from them that I learned about this kind of simple, swift-paced style, but the main reason for the style of my first novel is that I simply did not have the time to write sustained prose.","I don\u2019t know, I don\u2019t feel right unless I\u2019ve got the sea and mountains nearby. People are mostly a product of where they were born and raised. How you think and feel\u2019s always linked to the lay of the land, the temperature. The prevailing winds, even.","Now and then may not be enough\u2026You have to enjoy it while you\u2019re still young. enjoy it to the fullest. You can use the memories of what you did to warm your body after you get old and can\u2019t do it anymore.","Never trust a man who carries a handkerchief, I always say. One of many prejudicial rules of thumb.","When I\'m running I don\'t have to talk to anybody and don\'t have to listen to anybody. This is a part of my day I can\'t do without.","Okay, let\u2019s put it this way. I would like to sleep with you. But it\u2019s alright if I don\u2019t sleep with you. What I\u2019m saying is I\u2019d like to be as fair as possible. I don\u2019t want to force anything on anybody, any more than I\u2019d want anything forced on me. It\u2019s enough that I feel your presence or see your commas swirling around me.","I didn\'t start running because somebody asked me to become a runner. Just like I didn\'t become a novelist because someone asked me to. One day, out of the blue, I wanted to write a novel. And one day, out of the blue, I started to run-simply because I wanted to. I\'ve always done whatever I felt like doing in life. People may try to stop me, and convince me I\'m wrong, but I won\'t change.","You know, they\'ve got these chocolate assortments, and you like some but you don\'t like others? And you eat all the ones you like, and the only ones left are the ones you don\'t like as much? I always think about that when something painful comes up. Now I just have to polish these off, and everything\'ll be OK. Life is a box of chocolates. I suppose you could call it a philosophy.","With the advent of winter, her eyes seemed to take on a greater transparency, a transparency that lead nowhere. Occassionally, for no particular reason, Naoko would gaze into my eyes as if searching for something. Each time I was filled with odd sensations of lonliness and inadequecy.","You\u2019re optimistic one moment, only to be racked the next by the certainty that it will all fall to pieces. And in the end it does.","[...] Shimamoto had her own little world within her. A world that was for her alone, one I could not enter.","The heavy smell of flower petals stroked the walls of my lungs.","By then running had entered the realm of the metaphysical. First there came the action of running, and accompanying it there was this entity known as me. I run; therefore I am.","No, I don\'t want your money. The world moves less by money than by what you owe people and what they owe you. I don\'t like to owe anybody anything, so I keep to myself as much on the lending side as I can.","In a place far away from anyone or anywhere, I drifted off for a moment.","I don\'t think of myself as an artist. I\'m just a guy who can write.","A person\u2019s destiny is something you look back at afterwards, not something to be known in advance.","For me, running is both exercise and a metaphor. Running day after day, piling up the races, bit by bit I raise the bar, and by clearing each level I elevate myself. At least that\u2019s why I\u2019ve put in the effort day after day: to raise my own level. I\u2019m no great runner, by any means. I\u2019m at an ordinary \u2013 or perhaps more like mediocre \u2013 level. But that\u2019s not the point. The point is whether or not I improved over yesterday. In long-distance running the only opponent you have to beat is yourself, the way you used to be.","One listless day followed another, with nothing to distinguish one from the next. You could have changed the order and no one would have noticed.","If you think about it, an unfair society is a society that makes it possible for you to exploit your abilities to the limit.","You throw a stone into a deep pond. Splash. The sound is big, and it reverberates throughout the surrounding area. What comes out of the pond after that? All we can do is stare at the pond, holding our breath.","Ever since that happened to me, I haven\'t been able to give myself to anyone in this world.","You live by yourself for a stretch of time and you get to staring at different objects. Sometimes you talk to yourself. You take meals in crowded joints. You develop an intimate relationship with your used Subaru. You slowly but surely become a has-been.","I find myself thinking about my ongoing existence as a human being and the path that lies ahead of me. Though of course these thoughts lead to but one place - death.","Writing is fun - at least mostly. I write for four hours every day. After that I go running. As a rule, 10 kilometers (6.2 miles). That\'s easy to manage.","As long as I kept my body moving I could forget about the emptiness inside.","Each individual has their own unique color, which shines faintly around the contours of their body. Like a halo. Or a backlight. I\'m able to see those colors clearly.","I\u2019m free, I think. I shut my eyes and think hard and deep about how free I am, but I can\u2019t really understand what it means. All I know is I\u2019m totally alone. All alone in an unfamiliar place, like some solitary explorer who\u2019s lost his compass and his map. Is this what it means to be free? I don\u2019t know, and I give up thinking about it.","They sat on a park bench, held hands, and told each other their stories hour after hour. They were not lonely anymore. They had found and been found by their 100% perfect other. What a wonderful thing it is to find and be found by your 100% perfect other. It\'s a miracle, a cosmic miracle.","I wander though China. Without ever having boarded a plane. My travels take place here in the Tokoyo subways, in the backseat of a taxi... all of a sudden this city will start to go. In a flash, the buildings will crumble. Over the Tokyo streets will fall my China, like ash, leaching into everything it touches. Slowly, gradually, until nothing remains. No, this isn\'t a place for me.","I was twenty-one at the time, about to turn twenty-two. No prospect of graduating soon, and yet no reason to quit school. Caught in the most curiously depressing circumstances. For months I\'d been stuck, unable to take one step in any new direction. The world kept moving on; I alone was at a standstill. In the autumn, everything took on a desolate cast, the colors swiftly fading before my eyes. The sunlight, the smell of the grass, the faintest patter of rain, everything got on my nerves.","Mountains, according to the angle of view, the season, the time of day, the beholder\'s frame of mind, or any one thing, can effectively change their appearance. Thus, it is essential to recognize that we can never know more than one side, one small aspect of a mountain.","Somewhere in his body--perhaps in the marrow of his bones--he would continue to feel her absence.","We knew exactly what we wanted in each other. And even so, it ended. One day it stopped, as if the film simply slipped off the reel.","...most people in the world don\'t really use their brains to think. And people who don\'t think are the ones who don\'t listen to others.","If I used being busy as an excuse not to run, I\'d never run again. I have only a few reasons to keep on running, and a truckload of them to quit.","At times like this, adults need a drink","Sometimes I feel like a caretaker of a museum -- a huge, empty museum where no one ever comes, and I\'m watching over it for no one but myself.","she was beautiful and seemingly quite intelligent, what with her pentameter search system. There wasn\'t a reason in the world not to find her appealing.","These days I just can\'t seem to say what I mean [...]. I just can\'t. Every time I try to say something, it misses the point. Either that or I end up saying the opposite of what I mean. The more I try to get it right the more mixed up it gets. Sometimes I can\'t even remember what I was trying to say in the first place. It\'s like my body\'s split in two and one of me is chasing the other me around a big pillar. We\'re running circles around it. The other me has the right words, but I can never catch her.","I\'ve always done whatever I felt like doing in life. People may try to stop me, and convince me I\'m wrong, but I won\'t change.","In certain areas of my life, I actively seek out solitude. Especially for someone in my line of work, solitude is, more or less, an inevitable circumstance. Sometimes, however, this sense of isolation, like acid spilling out of a bottle, can unconsciously eat away at a person\'s heart and dissolve it. You could see it, too, as a kind of double-edged sword. It protects me, but at the same time steadily cuts away at me from the inside.","I\'m a writer. I don\'t support any war. That\'s my principle.","Better to be a first-class matchbox than a second-class match.","Sheep hurt my father, and through my father, sheep have also hurt me.","two people can sleep in the same bed and still be alone when they close their eyes","Maybe the star doesnt even exist any more.Yet sometimes that light seems more real to me than anything.","\\"I believe you,\\" she whispers after a moment. \\"Please find my mind.\\"","Of course life frightens me sometimes. I don\'t happen to take that as the premise for everything else though. I\'m going to give it hundred percent and go as far as I can. I\'ll take what I want and leave what I don\'t want. That\'s how I intend to live my life, and it things go bad, I\'ll stop and reconsider at that point. If you think about it, an unfair society is a society that makes it possible for you to exploit your abilities to the limit.","It\'s like a kid standing at the window watching the rain.","Give yourself five minutes to consider how you can turn a miserable situation to your benefit and that light bulb is going to click on.","This was never any place I was meant to be. This isn\u2019t a place for me.","Age certainly hadn\'t conferred any smarts on me. Character maybe, but mediocrity is a constant, as one Russian writer put it. Russian writers have a way with aphorisms. They probably spend all winter thinking them up.","Her pupils have taken on a lonely hue, like grey clouds reflected in a calm lake.","But metaphors help eliminate what separates you and me.","My biggest fault is that the faults I was born with grow bigger each year.","This was something sure to be crammed full of warm secrets, like an antique clock built when peace filled the world.","The power to concentrate was the most important thing. Living without this power would be like opening one\u2019s eyes without seeing anything.","Is action merely the incidental product of thought, or is thought the consequential product of action?","There is nothing in this world that never takes a step outside a person\'s heart.","You don\'t have to judge the whole world by your own standards. Not everybody is like you, you know.","It\'s just like Yeats said. In dreams begin responsibilities. Flip this around and you could say that where there\'s no power to imagine, no responsibility can arise.","What I want is for the two of us to meet somewhere by chance one day, like, passing on the street, or getting on the same bus.","Everybody\'s born with some different thing at the core of their existence. And that thing, whatever it is, becomes like a heat source that runs each person from the inside. I have one too, of course. Like everybody else. But sometimes it gets out of hand. It swells or shrinks inside me, and it shakes me up. What I\'d really like to do is find a way to communicate that feeling to another person.","Not that we were incompatible: we just had nothing to talk about.","The unwaking world was as hushed as a deep forest.","Open your eyes, train your ears, use your head. If a mind you have, then use it while you can.","Things pass us by. Nobody can catch them. That\'s the way we live our lives.","Before I became a writer, I was running a jazz bar in the center of Tokyo, which means that I worked in filthy air all the time late into the night. I was very excited when I started making a living out of my writing, and I decided, \'I will live in nothing but an absolutely healthy way.\'","And everywhere, infinite options, infinite possibilities. An infinity, and at the same time, zero. We try to scoop it all up in our hands, and what we get is a handful of zero. That\'s the city","I generally concentrate on work for three or four hours every morning. I sit at my desk and focus totally on what I\u2019m writing. I don\u2019t see anything else, I don\u2019t think about anything else.","I can\'t build a simple shelf. I have no idea how to change an oil filter on a car. I can\'t even stick a stamp on an envelope straight. And I\'m always dialling the wrong number. But I have come up with a few original cocktails that people seem to like.","Waves of thought are stirring. In a twilight corner of her consciousness, one tiny fragment and another tiny fragment call out wordlessly to eachother, their spreading ripples intermingling.","Memory is so crazy! It\'s like we\'ve got these drawers crammed with tons of useless stuff. Meanwhile, all the really important things we just keep forgetting, one after the other.","I\u2019ve built a wall around me, never letting anybody inside and trying not to venture outside myself","She\'s kind of funny looking. Her face is out of balance--broad forehead, button nose, freckled cheeks, and pointy ears. A slammed-together, rough sort of face you can\'t ignore. Still, the whole package isn\'t so bad. For all I know maybe she\'s not so wild about her own looks, but she seems comfortable with who she is, and that\'s the important thing.","I never made any plan before writing, however I succeeded. I enjoyed writing with excitement ,\\"what happen on the next page?\\"","I go back to the reading room, where I sink down in the sofa and into the world of The Arabian Nights. Slowly, like a movie fadeout, the real world evaporates. I\'m alone, inside the world of the story. My favourite feeling in the world.","Music always stimulates my imagination. When I\'m writing I usually have some Baroque music on low in the background chamber music by Bach, Telemann, and the like.","Narratives have the same power, I think. Some readers of my novels ask me, \\"Why do you understand me?\\". That\'s a huge pleasure of mine because it means that readers and I can make our narratives relative.","A girl doesn\'t always want to go out, you know, Mr. Wind-Up Bird. Sometimes she feels like being nasty--like, if the guy\'s gonna wait, let him really wait.","Even if there were two of me, I still couldn\'t do all that has to be done. No matter what, though, I keep up my running. Running every day is a kind of lifeline for me, so I\'m not going to lay off or quit just because I\'m busy. If I used being busy as an excuse not to run, I\'d never run again. I have only a few reasons to keep on running, and a truckload of them to quit. All I can do is keep those few reasons nicely polished.","In other words, let\'s face it: Life is basically unfair. But even in a situation that\'s unfair, I think it\'s possible to seek out a kind of fairness. Of course, that might take time and effort. And maybe it won\'t seem to be worth all that. It\'s up to each individual to decide whether or not it is.","Adults constantly raise the bar on smart children, precisely because they\'re able to handle it. The children get overwhelmed by the tasks in front of them and gradually lose the sort of openness and sense of accomplishment they innately have. When they\'re treated like that, children start to crawl inside a shell and keep everything inside. It takes a lot of time and effort to get them to open up again. Kids\' hearts are malleable, but once they gel it\'s hard to get them back the way they were.","There are symbolic dreams-- dreams that symbolize some reality. Then there are symbolic realities -- realities that symbolize a dream. Symbols are what you might call the honorary town councillors of the worm universe. In the worm universe, there is nothing unusual about a dairy cow seeking a pair of pliers. A cow is bound to get her pliers sometime. It has nothing to do with me.","I couldn\'t tell wether the hole that opened up inside me was from missing you or from the change of season","To me, love is a pure idea forged in flesh, awkwardly maybe, but it had to connect to somewhere, despite twists and turns of underground cable. An all-too-perfect thing. Sometimes the lines get crossed. Or you get a wrong number. But that\'s nobody\'s fault. It\'ll always be like that, so long as we exist in this physical form. As a matter of principle.","If you\'re going to while away the years, it\'s far better to live them with clear goals and fully alive then in a fog, and I believe #\u200e running helps you to do that. Exerting yourself to the fullest within your individual limits: that\'s the essence of running, and a metaphor for life.","After all this, I won\'t start to hate you.","..finally he was just another ant, working and working until he died without meaning.","I dream. Sometimes I think that\'s the only right thing to do.","Nights without work I spend with whisky and books.","Most young people were getting jobs in big companies, becoming company men. I wanted to be individual.","Judging the mistakes of strangers is an easy thing to do - and it feels pretty good.","If only I could fall sound asleep and wake up in my old reality!","Which is why I am writing this book. To think. To understand. It just happens to be the way I\'m made. I have to write things down to feel I fully comprehend them.","Things outside you are projections of what\'s inside you, and what\'s inside you is a projection of what\'s outside. So when you step into the labyrinth outside you, at the same time you\'re stepping into the labyrinth inside.","Once she was out of the car and gone, my world was suddenly hollow and meaningless.","I always write my novels with music (I don\'t listened to the music seriously.) Music seems to encourage me.","A strange, terrific force unlike anything I\'ve ever experienced is sprouting in my heart, taking root there, growing. Shut up behind my rib cage, my warm heart expands and contracts independent of my will--over and over.","When you fall in love, the natural thing to do is give yourself to it.","You make do with what you have. As you age you learn even to be happy with what you have.","I can be hurt, you know. I can get as exhausted as anybody else. I can feel so bad I want to cry, too.","Each day the sun would rise and set, the flag would be raised and lowered. Each Sunday I would have a date with my dead friend\u2019s girl. I had no idea what I was doing or what I was going to do.","A man is like a two-story house. The first floor is equipped with an entrance and a living room. On the second floor is every family member\'s room. They enjoy listening to music and reading books. On the first underground floor is the ruin of people\'s memories. The room filled with darkness is the second underground floor.","We can, if we so choose, wander aimlessly over the continent of the arbitrary. Rootless as some winged seed blown about on a serendipitous spring breeze.","Kids\' hearts are malleable, but once they gel it\'s hard to get them back the way they were.","When I was a teenager, I thought how great it would be if only I could write novels in English. I had the feeling that I would be able to express my emotions so much more directly than if I wrote in Japanese.","At any rate, that\u2019s how I started running. Thirty three\u2014that\u2019s how old I was then. Still young enough, though no longer a young man. The age that Jesus Christ died. The age that Scott Fitzgerald started to go downhill. That age may be a kind of crossroads in life. That was the age when I began my life as a runner, and it was my belated, but real, starting point as a novelist.","The sun sliced through the windshield, sealing me in light. I closed my eyes and felt the warmth on my eyelids. Sunlight traveled a long distance to reach this planet; an infinitesimal portion of that sunlight was enough to warm my eyelids. I was moved. That something as insignificant as an eyelid had its place in the workings on the universe, that the cosmic order did not overlook this momentary fact.","Don\'t let appearances fool you. There\'s always only one reality!","Life: I\'ll never understand it.","So I made up my mind I was going to find someone who would love me unconditionally three hundred and sixty-five days a year. Watanabe: Wow, and did your search pay off? M: That\'s the hard part. I guess I\'ve been waiting so long I\'m looking for perfection. That makes it tough.","It\'s basically the same in all periods of societies. If you belong to the majority, you can avoid thinking about lots of troubling things.\' \'And those troubling things are all you /can/ think about when you\'re one of the few.\' \'That\'s about the size of it,\' she said mournfully. \'But maybe, if you\'re in a situation like that, you learn to think for yourself.\' \'Yes, but maybe what you end up thinking for yourself /about/ is all those troubling things.","Everybody thinks I\'m this delicate little girl. But you can\'t tell a book by it\'s cover.\' To which she added a momentary smile.","Her cry was the saddest sound of orgasm that I had ever heard.","sometimes I think I\'ve got this hard kernel in my heart, and nothing much can get inside it. I doubt if I can really love anybody.","And as we live our lives we discover - drawing toward us the thin threads attached to each - what has been lost. I closed my eyes and tried to bring to mind as many beautiful lost things as I could. Drawing them closer, holding on to them.","I think people who share my dreams can enjoy reading my novels. And that\'s a wonderful thing. I said that myths are like a reservoir of stories, and if I can act as a similar kind of \\"reservoir,\\" albeit a modest one, that would make me very happy.","Why do people have to build such depressing places? I\'m not saying that every nook and cranny of the world has to be beautiful, but does it have to be this ugly?","I guess I felt attached to my weakness. My pain and suffering too. Summer light, the smell of a breeze, the sound of cicadas - if I like these things, why should I apologize?","Whether it\'s good for anything or not, cool or totally uncool, in the final analysis what\'s most important is what you can\'t see but can feel in your heart.","I closed my own jazz bar so I could be a man who can write novels as I like. I was pleased about that. This pleasure was connected to the pleasure of writing.","This place is too calm, too natural--too complete. I don\'t deserve it. At least not yet.","If there\'s any guy crazy enough to attack me, I\'m going to show him the end of the world -- close up. I\'m going to let him see the kingdom come with his own eyes. I\'m going to send him straight to the southern hemisphere and let the ashes of death rain all over him and the kangaroos and the wallabies.","Where the road sloped upward beyond the trees, I sat and looked toward the building where Naoko lived. It was easy to tell which room was hers. All I had to do was find the one window toward the back where a faint light trembled. I focused on that point of light for a long, long time. It made me think of something like the final throb of a soul\'s dying embers. I wanted to cup my hands over what was left and keep it alive. I went on watching the way Jay Gatsby watched that tiny light on the opposite shore night after night.","In the spring of her twenty-second year, Sumire fell in love for the first time in her life.","So I\'m not crazy after all! I thought it looked good myself once I cut it all off. Not one guy likes it, though. They all tell me I look like a first grader or a concentration camp survivor. What\'s this thing that guys have for girls with long hair? Fascists, the whole bunch of them! Why do guys all think girls with long hair are the classiest, the sweetest, the most feminine? I mean, I myself know at least two hundred and fifty unclassy girls with long hair. Really.","Let me just tell you this, Watanabe,\\" said Midori, pressing her cheek against my neck. \\"I\'m a real, live girl, with real, live blood gushing through my veins. You\'re holding me in your arms and I\'m telling you that I love you. I\'m ready to do anything you tell me to do. I may be a little bit mad, but I\'m a good girl, and honest, and I work hard, I\'m kind of cute, I have nice boobs, I\'m a good cook, and my father left me a trust fund. I mean, I\'m a real bargain, don\'t you think? If you don\'t take me, I\'ll end up going somewhere else.","I began running on an everyday basis after I became a writer. As being a writer requires sitting at a desk for hours a day, without getting some exercise you\'d quickly get out of shape and gain weight, I figured.","Symbolism and meaning are two separate things. I think she found the right words by bypassing procedures like meaning and logic. She captured words in a dream, like delicately catching hold of a butterfly\u2019s wings as it flutters around. Artists are those who can evade the verbose.","Young people these days don\'t trust anything at all. They want to be free.","Beyond the window, some kind of small, black thing shot across the sky. A bird, possibly. Or it might have been someone\'s soul being blown to the far side of the world.","What\'s really important here,\\" I whispered loudly to myself,\\"is not the big things other people have thought up, but the small things you, yourself have","It\'s not right for one friend to do all the giving and the other to do all the taking: that\'s not real friendship.","Only where there is disillusionment and depression and sorrow does happiness arise; without the despair of loss, there is no hope.","What\u2019s more, you\u2019re loads better than you think you are.\u201d \u201cSo why is it I get to thinking that way?\u201d I puzzled. \u201cThat\u2019s because you\u2019re only half-living.\u201d she said briskly. \u201cThe other half is still untapped somewhere.","Where are you now?\u2019 Where was I now? Gripping the receiver, I raised my hand and turned to see what lay beyond the telephone booth. Where was I now? I had no idea. No idea at all. Where was this place? All that flashed into my eyes were the countless shapes of people walking by to nowhere. Again and again, I called out for Midori from the dead center of this place that was no place.","Life is like a box of cookies.","That\'s evolution. Evolution\'s always hard. Hard and bleak. No such thing as happy evolution","What I was chasing in circles must have been the tail of the darkness inside me.","What\u2019s most important is what you can\u2019t see but can feel in your heart. To be able to grasp something of value, sometimes you have to perform seemingly inefficient acts. But even activities that appear fruitless don\u2019t necessarily end up so. That\u2019s the feeling I have, as someone who\u2019s felt this, who\u2019s experienced it.","The years nineteen and twenty are a crucial stage in the maturation of character, and if you allow yourself to become warped when you\'re that age, it will cause you pain when you\'re older.","His heart, like mine, was ticking off the time allotted to his small restless body.","You are entering a phase of your life in which many different things will occur...bad things that seem good at first and good things that seem bad at first.","It is the same with anything - you have to learn through your own experience, paying your own way. You can\'t learn it from a book.","Any explanation or logic that explains everything so easily has a hidden trap in it. I\'m speaking from experience. Somebody once said if it\'s something a single book can explain, it\'s not worth having explained. What I mean is don\'t leap to any conclusions.","People lose fifty million skin cells every day. The cells get scraped off and turn into invisible dust, and disappear into the air. Maybe we are nothing but skin cells as far as the world is concerned.","What do I like about math? , When I\'ve got figures in front of me, it relaxes me. Kind of like, everything fits where it belongs.","A person\'s last moments are an important thing. You can\'t choose how you\'re born but you can choose how you die.","Hundreds of butterflies flitted in and out of sight like short-lived punctuation marks in a stream of consciousness without beginning or end.","I hate requests. They make me feel unhappy. It\'s like when I take a book out of the library. As soon as I start to read it, all I can think about is when I\'ll finish it.","All imperfections are forced upon the imperfect, so the \'perfect\' can live content and oblivious.","But I didn\'t walk a single step. I stopped a lot to stretch, but I never walked. I didn\'t come here to walk. I came to run. That\'s the reason-the only reason-I flew all the way to the northern tip of Japan. No matter how slow I might run, I wasn\'t about to walk. That was the rule.","Wherever there\'s hope there\'s a trial.","I\'d made it back to the land of the living. No matter how boring or mediocre a world it might be, this was it.","When I was fifteen, all I wanted was to go off to some other world, a place beyond anybody\u2019s reach. A place beyond the flow of time.\u201d - But there\u2019s no place like that in this world. - Exactly. Which is why I\u2019m living here, in this world where things are continually damaged, where the heart is fickle, where time flows past without a break.","I used to think the years would go by in order, that you get older one year at a time. But it\'s not like that. It happens overnight.","Even if you managed to escape from one cage, weren\'t you just in another, larger one?","Being alive, if you had to define it, meant emitting a variety of smells.","This uneasiness comes over me from time to time, and I feel as if I\'ve somehow been pieced together from two different puzzles.","They put up with such strenuous training, and where did their thoughts, their hopes and dreams, disappear to? When people pass away, do their thoughts just vanish?","It\u2019s precisely because of the pain, the we can get the feeling, through this process, of really being alive\u2014or at least a partial sense of it.","I\'m not a fast reader. I like to linger over each sentence, enjoying the style. If I don\'t enjoy the writing, I stop.","Having an object that symbolizes freedom might make a person happier than actually getting the freedom it represents.","Now for a good twelve-hour sleep, I told myself. Twelve solid hours. Let birds sing, let people go to work. Somewhere out there, a volcano might blow, Israeli commandos might decimate a Palestinian village. I couldn\'t stop it. I was going to sleep.","I\'m an average person. Is just that I like reading.","I can never say what I want to say, it\'s been like this for a while now. I try to say something but all I get are wrong words - the wrong words or the exact opposite words from what I mean. I try to correct myself, and that only makes it worse. I lose track of what I was trying to say to begin with. It\'s like I\'m split in two and playing tag with myself. One half is chasing this big, fat post. The other me has the right words, but this can\'t catch her.","You couldn\u2019t begin to imagine who I am, where I\u2019m going, or what I\u2019m about to do, All of you are trapped here. You can\u2019t go anywhere, forward or back. But I\u2019m not like you. I have work to do. I have a mission to accomplish. And so, with your permission, I shall move ahead.","She gave me this look \u2013 she might have been watching from a lifeboat as the ship went down. Or maybe it was the other way around.","It takes years to build up, it takes moments to destroy.","As long as an individual\'s alive, he will undergo experience in some form or other, and those experiences are stored up instant by instant. To stop experiencin\' is to die.","The curious thing about individuals is that their singularity always goes beyond any category or generalization in the book.","I\'ve always liked libraries. They\'re quiet and full of books and full of knowledge.","Of course you keep telling yourself there\'s something to be learned from everything, and growing old shouldn\'t be that hard. That\'s the general drift.","So many dreams, so many disappointments, so many promises. And in the end, they all just vanish.","I want to write stories that are different from the ones I\'ve written so far, Junpei thought: I want to write about people who dream and wait for the night to end, who long for the light so they can hold the ones they love. But right now I have to stay here and keep watch over this woman and this girl. I will never let anyone-not anyone-try to put them into that crazy box- not even if the sky should fall or the earth crack open with a roar.","It\'s just a feeling I have. What you see with your eyes is not necessarily real. My enemy is, among other things, the me inside me.","You have to make an effort to always look at the good side, always think about the good things. Then you\'ve got nothing to be afraid of. If something bad comes up, you do more thinking at that point.","I\'m the kind of person who has to totally commit to whatever I do.","Some people can work their butts off and never get what they\'re aiming for while others can get it without any effort at all.","No matter how long you stand there examining yourself naked before a mirror, you\'ll never see reflected what\'s inside.","My grandpa always said asking a question is embarrassing for a moment, but not asking is embarrassing for a lifetime.","Like a Chinese box, the world of the novel contained smaller worlds, and inside those were yet smaller worlds. Together, these worlds made up a single universe, and the universe waited there in the book to be discovered by the reader.","It seemed to me that this world has a serious shortage of both logic and kindness.","You know what it\u2019s like when you\u2019re trying to fall asleep and it only makes you more wide awake?","The moon had been observing the earth close-up longer than anyone. It must have witnessed all of the phenomena occurring - and all of the acts carried out - on this earth. But the moon remained silent; it told no stories.","The worst thoughts usually strike in the dead of the night.","But still,\\" Ayumi said, \\"it seems to me that this world has a serious shortage of both logic and kindness.\\" \\"You may be right,\\" Aomame said, \\"But it\'s too late to trade it in for another one.","Most of the psychological differences between men and women seem to come from differences in their reproductive system","The ones with no imagination are always the quickest to justify themselves.","The world is full of ways and means to waste time.","I\u2019m just kinda tired. Like a monkey in the rain.","It\'s the real world, full of gaps and inconsistencies and anticlimaxes.","Probably.\\" \\"Again with the probablys.\\" \\"A world full of probablys,\\" she said.","He sometimes wondered if she had become involved with him just so that she could cry in someone\'s arms. Maybe she can\'t cry alone, and that\'s why she needs me.","Like it or not, it\'s the society we live in. Even the standard of right and wrong has been subdivided, made sophisticated. Within good, there\'s fashionable good and unfashionable good, and ditto for bad. Within fashionable good, there\'s formal and then there\'s casual; there\'s hip, there\'s cool, there\'s trendy, there\'s snobbish. Mix \'n\' match.","my heart would swell without warning, and tremble, and lurch with a stab of pain. I would try clamping my eyes shut and gritting my teeth, and waiting for it to pass. And it would pass -- but slowly, taking its own time, and leaving a dull ache behind.","I saw that she was crying. Before I knew it, I was kissing her. Others on the platform were staring at us, but I didn\'t care about such things anymore. We were alive, she and I. And all we had to think about was continuing to live.","There\u2019s nothing wrong with not looking like something. It just means you don\u2019t fit the stereotype yet.","Another person\'s life is that person\'s life. You can\'t take responsibility.","I\'m not afraid to die. What I\'m afraid of is having reality get the better of me, of having reality leave me behind.","I may not look it, but I can be a very patient guy. And killing time is one of my specialities.","Sometimes when I think of life, I feel like a piece of driftwood washed up on shore.","I think I\'ll stay alive here a bit longer, and see with my own eyes what\'s going to happen. I can still die after that - it won\'t be too late. Probably.","I had my jazz club and I had enough money. So I didn\'t have to write for my living.","I have no models in Japanese literature. I created my own style, my own way.","I used to run a full marathon in three hours and 25 or 26 minutes. Not any more.","I\'m a writer, not a professional runner. It\'s fun and it helps me write. I need powerful concentration.","I\'ve been running a full marathon every year for more than 20 years, and my record is getting worse. Getting older, getting worse. It\'s natural.","I often recall these words when I am writing, and I think to myself, \u201cIt\u2019s true. There aren\u2019t any new words. Our job is to give new meanings and special overtones to absolutely ordinary words.\u201d I find the thought reassuring. It means that vast, unknown stretches still lie before us, fertile territories just waiting for us to cultivate them.","Time weighs down on you like an old, ambiguous dream. You keep on moving, trying to sleep through it. But even if you go to the ends of the earth, you won\'t be able to escape it. Still, you have to go there- to the edge of the world. There\'s something you can\'t do unless you get there.","So once you\'re dead there\'s just nothing? Mari: Basically... Korogi: I get so scared when I start thinking about this stuff. I can hardly breathe, and my whole body wants to shrink into a corner. It\'s so much easier to just believe in reincarnation.","This person, this self, this me, finally, was made somewhere else. Everything had come from somewhere else, and it would all go somewhere else. I was nothing but a pathway for the person known as me.","Instead of things I\'m good at, it might be faster to list the things I can\'t do. I can\'t cook or clean the house. My room\'s a mess, and I\'m always losing things. I love music, but I can\'t sing a note. I\'m clumsy and can barely sew a stitch. My sense of direction is the pits, and I can\'t tell left from right half the time. When I get angry, I tend to break things. Plates and pencils, alarm clocks. Later on I regret it, but at the time I can\'t help myself. I have no money in the bank. I\'m bashful for no reason, and I have hardly any friends to speak of.","You\'re walking through a field all by yourself one day in spring and this sweet little bear cub with velvet fur and shiny little eyes comes walking along. And he says to you, \'Hi, there, little lady. Want to tumble with me?\' So you and the bear spend the whole day in each other\'s arms, tumbling down this clover-covered hill. Nice, huh?","So for all that we might speak words in each other\'s vicinity, this could never develop into anything that could be called a conversation. It was as though we were speaking in different languages. If the Dalai Lama were on his deathbed and the jazz musician Eric Dolphy were to try to explain to him the importance of choosing one\'s engine oil in accordance with changes in the sound of the bass clarinet, that exchange might have been more worthwhile and effective than my conversations with Noboru Wataya.","I may be the type who manages to grab all the pointless things in life but lets the really important things slip away.","You are a beautiful person, Doctor. Clearheaded. Strong. But you seem always to be dragging your heart along the ground. From now on, little by little, you must prepare yourself to face death. If you devote all of your future energy to living, you will not be able to die well. You must begin to shift gears, a little at a time. Living and dying are, in a sense, of equal value.","Don\'t you think it would be wonderful to get rid of everything and everybody and just go some place where you don\'t know a soul?","The faintest gleam of their lost memories glimmered for the briefest moment in their hearts.","Well, finally, the events I\'ve been through have been tremendously complicated. All kinds of characters have come on the scene, and strange things have happened one after another, to the point where, if I try to think about them in order, I lose track.","I read Naoko\'s letter again and again, and each time I read it I would be filled with the same unbearable sadness I used to feel whenever Naoko stared into my eyes. I had no way to deal with it, no place I could take it to or hide it away. Like the wind passing over my body, it had neither shape nor weight, nor could I wrap myself in it.","Why?\\" she screamed. \\"Are you crazy? You know the English subjunctive, you understand trigonometry, you can read Marx, and you don\'t know the answer to something as simple as that? Why do you even have to ask? Why do you have to make a girl SAY something like this? I like you more than I like him, that\'s all. I wish I had fallen in love with somebody a little more handsome, of course. But I didn\'t. I fell in love with you!","The morning air of the pasture turned steadily cooler. Day by day, the bright golden leaves of the birches turned more spotted as the first winds of winter slipped between the withered branches and across the highlands toward the southeast. Stopping in the center of the pasture, I could hear the winds clearly. No turning back, they pronounced. The brief autumn was gone.","If I\'m going to merely ramble, maybe I should just snuggle under the warm covers, think of Miu, and play with myself.","Animals that not only move by their own free will and share feelings with people but also possess sight and hearing qualify as deserving of names.","And, well, mine are kind of on the heavy side anyway. The first day or two, I don\'t want to do ANYTHING. Make sure you keep away from me then.\' I\'d like to, but how can I tell?\' I asked. O.K., I\'ll wear a hat for a couple of days after my period starts. A red one. That should work,\' she said with a laugh. \'If you see me on the street and I\'m wearing a red hat, don\'t talk to me, just run away.","It was a small room with dim light coming in the window, reminiscent of old Polish films.","All you have to do is wait,\u201d I explained. \u201cSit tight and wait for the right moment. Not try to change anything by force, just watch the drift of things. Make an effort to cast a fair eye on everything. If you do that, you just naturally know what to do. But everyone\u2019s always too busy. They\u2019re too talented, their schedules are too full. They\u2019re too interested in themselves to think about what\u2019s fair.","If I choose to write about sheep, it\'s just because I happened to write about sheep. There is no deep significance.","Let me tell you something, Mari. The ground we stand on looks solid enough, but if something happens it can drop right out from under you. And once that happens, you\'ve had it: things\'ll never be the same. All you can do is go on, living alone down there in the darkness.","\\"Dance,\\" said the Sheep Man. \\"Yougottadance.

It is there, that we experience our victories and defeats.","I love pop culture -- the Rolling Stones, the Doors, David Lynch, things like that. That\'s why I said I don\'t like elitism.","Her smile steps offstage for a moment, then does an encore, all while I\'m dealing with my blushing face.","Wasn\'t he the one who said you shouldn\'t trust anybody who calls himself an ordinar man? - Naoko","It was a strange feeling, like touching a void.","The dead will always be dead, but we have to go on living.","I spent thirty-three years in another man\'s shadow. I went everywhere he went, I helped him with everything he did. I was in a sense a part of him. When you live like that for a long time, you gradually lose track of what it is you yourself really want out of life","Don\'t tell me anymore. You should have your dream, as the old woman told you to. I understand how you feel, but if you put those feelings into words they will turn into lies. (from Thailand)","Have your dream...What you need now more than anything is discipline. Cast off mere words. Words turn into stone. (from Thailand)","I just gave them a little scare. A touch of psychological terror. As Joseph Conrad once wrote, true terror is the kind that men feel towards their imagination. (from Super-frog Saves Tokyo)","Time passes slowly. Nobody says a word, everyone lost in quiet reading. One person sits at a desk jotting down notes, but the rest are sitting there silently, not moving, totally absorbed. Just like me.","I miss you terribly sometimes, but in general I go on living with all the energy I can muster. Just as you take care of the birds and the fields every morning, every morning I wind my own spring. I give it some 36 good twists by the time I\'ve got up, brushed my teeth, shaved, eaten breakfast, changed my clothes, left the dorm, and arrived at the university. I tell myself, \\"OK, let\'s make this day another good one.\\" I hadn\'t noticed before, but they tell me I talk to myself a lot these days. Probably mumbling to myself while I wind my spring.","All of us are imperfect human beings living in an imperfect world.","Inside him, twenty years dissolved and mixed into one complex, swirling whole. Everything that had accumulated over the years-- all he had seen, all the words he has spoken, all the values he had held-- all of it coalesced into one solid, thick pillar in his heart, the core of which was spinning like a potter\'s wheel. Wordlessly, Tengo observed the scene, as if watching the destruction and rebirth of a planet.","Tengo could hardly believe it-- that in this frantic, labyrinth-like world, two people\'s hearts-- a boy\'s and a girl\'s-- could be connected, unchanged, even though they hadn\'t seen each other for twenty years.","I was reborn,\\" she said, her hot breath brushing his ear. \\"You were reborn,\\" Tengo said. \\"Because I died once.\\" \\"You died once,\\" Tengo repeated. \\"On a night when there was a cold rain falling,\\" she said. \\"Why did you die?\\" \\"So I would be reborn like this.\\" \\"You would be reborn,\\" Tengo said. \\"More or less,\\" she whispered quietly. \\"In all sorts of forms.","Genius or fool, you don\'t live in the world alone. You can hide underground or you can build a wall around yourself, but somebody\'s going to come along and screw up the works.","Listen. I may not be much, but I\'m all I\'ve got. Maybe you need a magnifying glass to find my face in my high school graduation photo. Maybe I haven\'t got any family or friends. Yes, yes, I know all that. But, strange as it might seem, I\'m not entirely dissatisfied with life... I feel pretty much at home with what I am. I don\'t want to go anywhere. I don\'t want any unicorns behind fences.","But if you peeled away the ornamental egos that she had built, there was only an abyss of nothingness and the intense thirst that came with it.","For some reason all the middle-aged women he knew were very efficient.","It\'s the same with menus and men and just about anything else: we think we\'re choosing things for ourselves, but in fact we may not be choosing anything. It could be that everthing\'s being decided in advance and we pretend we\'re making choices. Free will may be an illusion. I often think that.","Everybody burns out in this world; amateur, pro, it doesn\'t matter, they all burn out, they all get hurt, the OK guys and the not-OK guys both. That\'s why everybody takes out a little insurance. I\'ve got some too, here at the bottom of the heap. That way, you manage to survive if you burn out. If you\'re all by yourself and don\'t belong anywhere, you go down once, and you\'re out. Finished.","Things may look different to you than they did before. I\'ve had that experience myself. But don\'t let appearances fool you. There\'s only one reality.","Our faces were no more than ten inches apart but she was lightyears away from me.","I\u2019ve never once thought about how I was going to die,\u201d she said. \u201cI can\u2019t think about it. I don\u2019t even know how I\u2019m going to live.","Most people are not looking for provable truths. As you said, truth is often accompanied by intense pain, and almost no one is looking for painful truths. What people need is beautiful, comforting stories that make them feel as if their lives have some meaning. Which is where religion comes from.","A certain kind of shittiness, a certain kind of stagnation, a certain kind of darkness, goes on propagating itself by its own power in its own self-contained cycle. And once it passes a certain point, no one can stop it-even if the person himself wants to stop it.","According to Chekhov,\\" Tamaru said, rising from his chair, \\"once a gun appears in a story, it has to be fired.\\" \\"Meaning what?\\" \\"Meaning, don\'t bring unnecessary props into a story. If a pistol appears, it has to be fired at some point. Chekhov liked to write stories that did away with all useless ornamentation.","At the entrance to the original tower, there is a stone into which Jung carved some words with his own hand: \'Cold or not, God is present.","Whoa!\\" he says with a smile. The wrinkles at the corners of his eyes deepen. \\"Chicken salad a la George Orwell!","It is a lonely life sometimes, like throwing a stone into the deep darkness. It might hit something, but you can\u2019t see it. The only thing you can do is to guess, and to believe.","Problem is, once I sit at my desk and put all these down on paper. I realize something vital is missing. It doesn\'t crystallize - no crystals, just pebbles. And I\'m not transported anywhere.","If there\u2019s something I can\u2019t do but want to, I won\u2019t relax until I\u2019m able to do it.","I\u2019m me, and at the same time not me. That\u2019s what it felt like. A very still, quiet feeling.","That was the rule. Break one of my rules once, and I\u2019m bound to break many more.","Has the dark shadow really disappeared? Or is it inside me, concealed, waiting for its chance to reappear? Like a clever thief hidden inside a house, breathing quietly, waiting until everyone\u2019s asleep. I have looked deep inside myself, trying to detect something that might be there. But just as our consciousness is a maze, so too is our body. Everywhere you turn there\u2019s darkness, and a blind spot. Everywhere you find silent hints, everywhere a surprise is waiting for you.","In real life things don\u2019t go so smoothly. At certain points in our lives, when we really need a clear-cut solution, the person who knocks at our door is, more likely than not, a messenger bearing bad news.","I don\'t know how many good books I still have in me; I hope there are another four or five.","Reaching the finish line, never walking, and enjoying the race. These three, in this order, are my goals.","There wasn\'t a cloud in the sky, no wind, and everything was quiet around us - all we could hear were birds chirping in the woods. The war seemed like something in a faraway land that had nothing to do with us. We sang songs as we hiked up the hill, sometimes imitating the birds we heard. Except for the fact that the war was still going on, it was a perfect morning.","In any case, suffice it to say I enjoyed hearing about faraway places. I had stocked up a whole store of these places, like a bear getting ready for hibernation. I\'d close my eyes, and streets would materialize, rows of houses take shape. I could hear people\'s voices, feel the gentle, steady rhythm of their lives, those people so distant, whom I\'d probably never know.","Since I\'m a novelist I\'m the opposite of you - I believe that what\'s most important is what cannot be measured. I\'m not denying your way of thinking, but the greater part of people\'s lives consist of things that are unmeasurable, and trying to change all these to something measurable is realistically impossible.","Cell phones are so convenient that they\'re an inconvenience.","[But] we accept irony through a device called metaphor. And through that we grow and become deeper human beings.","A state of chronic powerlessness eats away at a person","Everything has boundaries. the same holds true with thought. you shouldn\'t fear boundaries, but you also should not be afraid of destroying them. that\'s what is most important if you want to be free: respect for and exasperation with boundaries. what\'s really important in life is always the things that are secondary.","Perhaps I\'m just too painstaking a type of person, but I can\'t grasp much of anything without putting down my thoughts in writing.","I\'ve run the Boston Marathon 6 times before. I think the best aspects of the marathon are the beautiful changes of the scenery along the route and the warmth of the people\'s support. I feel happier every time I enter this marathon.","Among the many values in life, I appreciate freedom most.","Whenever I write a novel, music just sort of naturally slips in (much like cats do, I suppose).","It is hard to be an individual in Japan.","When I am writing, I do not distinguish between the natural and supernatural. Everything seems real. That is my world, you could say.","I have always liked running, so it wasn\'t particularly difficult to make it a habit. All you need is a pair of running shoes and you can do it anywhere. It does not require anybody to do it with, and so I found the sport perfectly fits me as a person who tends to be independent and individualistic.","You have to dream intentionally. Most people dream a dream when they are asleep. But to be a writer, you have to dream while you are awake, intentionally.","Every writer has his writing technique - what he can and can\'t do to describe something like war or history. I\'m not good at writing about those things, but I try because I feel it is necessary to write that kind of thing.","I am worrying about my country. I feel I have a responsibility as a novelist to do something.","I\'m not a fast thinker, but once I am interested in something, I am doing it for many years.","Most near-future fictions are boring. It\'s always dark and always raining, and people are so unhappy.","You have to be practical. So every time I say, if you want to write a novel you have to be practical, people get bored. They are disappointed. They are expecting a more dynamic, creative, artistic thing to say. What I want to say is: you have to be practical.","A fortunate author can write maybe twelve novels in his lifetime.","Concentration is one of the happiest things in my life.","I didn\'t read so much Japanese literature. Because my father was a teacher of Japanese literature, I just wanted to do something else.","I have been told I\'ve got a darkish personality. A few times.\\" Takahashi swings his trombone case from his right shoulder to his left. Then he says, \\"It\'s not as if our lives are divided simply into light and dark. There\'s shadowy middle ground. Recognizing and understanding the shadows is what a healthy intelligence does. And to acquire a healthy intelligence takes a certain amount of time and effort. I don\'t think you have a particularly dark character.","I often dream about the Dolphin Hotel.","It was a short one-paragraph item in the morning edition.","I was thirty-seven then, strapped in my seat as the huge 747 plunged through dense cloud cover on approach to the Hamburg airport.","On any given day, something claims our attention. Anything at all, inconsequential things. A rosebud, a misplaced hat, that sweater we liked as a child, an old Gene Pitney record. A parade of trivia with no place to go. Things that bump around in our consciousness for two or three days then go back to wherever they came from... to darkness. We\'ve got all these wells dug in our hearts. While above the wells, birds flit back and forth.","And it came to me then. That we were wonderful traveling companions but in the end no more than lonely lumps of metal in their own separate orbits. From far off they look like beautiful shooting stars, but in reality they\'re nothing more than prisons, where each of us is locked up alone, going nowhere. When the orbits of these two satellites of ours happened to cross paths, we could be together. Maybe even open our hearts to each other. But that was only for the briefest moment. In the next instant we\'d be in absolute solitude. Until we burned up and became nothing.","it occurred to me what a simple thing reality is, how easy it is to make it work. It\'s just reality. Just housework. Just a home. Like running a simple machine. Once you learn to run it, it\'s just a matter of repetition. You push this button and pull that lever. You adjust a gauge, put on the lid, set the timer. The same thing, over and over.","Whenever I meet people for the first time, I get them to talk for ten minutes. Then I size them up from the exact opposite perspective of all they\u2019ve told me. Do you think that\u2019s crazy? \u201cNo,\u201d I said, shaking my head, \u201cI\u2019d guess your method works quite well.","Potentiality knocks on the door of my heart. [On Seeing The 100% Perfect Girl One Beautiful April Morning ]","In terms of evolutionary history, it was only yesterday that men learned to walk around on two legs and get in trouble thinking complicated thoughts. So don\'t worry, you\'ll burn out.","People have their own reasons for dying. It might look simple, but it never is. It\'s just like a rock. What\'s above ground is only a small part of it. But if you start pulling, it keeps coming and coming. The human mind dwells deep in darkness. Only the person himself knows the real reason, and maybe not even then.","Whether in music or in fiction, the most basic thing is rhythm. Your style needs to have good, natural, steady rhythm, or people won\'t keep reading your work.","So this was how secrets got started, I thought to myself. People constructed them little by little. I had not consciously intended to keep May Kasahara a secret from Kumiko. My relationship with her was not that big a deal: whether I mentioned it or not was of no consequence. Once it had flown down a certain delicate channel, however, it had become cloaked in the opacity of secretiveness, whatever my original intention had have been.","Oshima\'s silent for a time as he gazes at the forest, eyes narrowed. Birds are flitting from one branch to the next. His hands are clasped behind his head. \\"I know how you feel,\\" he finally says. \\"But this is something you have to work out on your own. Nobody can help you. That\'s what love\'s all about, Kafka. You\'re the one having those wonderful feelings, but you have to go it alone as you wander through the dark. Your mind and body have to bear it all. All by yourself.","But didn\'t you say you were satisfied with your life?\\" \\"Word games,\\" I dismissed. \\"Every army needs a flag.","Me, I\'ve seen 45 years and I\'ve only figured out one thing. That\'s this: if a person would just make the effort, there\'s something to be learned from everything. From even the most ordinary, commonplace things, there\'s always something you can learn. I read somewhere that they said there\'s even different philosophies in razors. Fact is, if it weren\'t for that, nobody\'d survive.","It was spring break, so the theater was always packed with high schools students. It was an animal house. I wanted to burn the place down.","I think of myself as more the non-turn-on type. so when I do get turned on, I don\u2019t trust it, I have to investigate the source.","Love can rebuild the world, they say, so everything\'s possible when it comes to love.","I have come to think that life is a far more limited thing than those in the midst of its maelstorm realize. That light shines into the act of life for only the briefest moment -\\n perhaps only a matter of seconds. Once it is gone and failed to grasp its offered revelation, there is no second chance. One may have to live the rest of one\'s life in hopeless depth of loneliness and remorse. In that twilight world, one can no longer look forward to anything. All that such a person holds in his hands is the withered corpse of what should have been.","I\'m still not sure I made the right choice when I told my wife about the bakery attack.But then,it might not have been a question of right or wrong. Which is to say that wrong choices can produce right results, and vice versa. I myself have adopted the position that,in fact, we never choose anything at all. Things happen. Or not.","This is the extent of his knowledge of the sea: it was very big, it was salty, and fish lived there.","Well, think of what I\u2019m doing to you right now. For me I\u2019m the self, and you\u2019re the object. For you, of course, it\u2019s the exact opposite\u2014you\u2019re the self to you and I\u2019m the object. And by exchanging self and object, we can project ourselves onto the other and gain self-consciousness. Volitionally.\u201d \u201cI still don\u2019t get it, but it sure feels good.\u201d \u201cThat\u2019s the whole idea,\u201d the girl said.","Perhaps most people in the world aren\u2019t trying to be free, Kafka. They just think they are. It\u2019s all an illusion. If they really were set free, most people would be in a real pickle. You\u2019d better remember that. People actually prefer not being free?","pulled into my convenient neighborhood fast food restaurant. I ordered shrimp salad, onion rings, and a beer. The shrimp were straight out of the freezer, the onion rings soggy. Looking around the place, though, I failed to spot a single customer banging on a tray or complaining to a waitress. So I shut up and finished my food. Expect nothing, get nothing.","Huge organizations and me don\'t get along. They\'re too inflexible, waste too much time, and have too many stupid people.","If writing novels is like planting a forest, then writing short stories is more like planting a garden. The two processes complement each other, creating a complete landscape that I treasure. The green foliage of the trees casts a pleasant shade over the earth, and the wind rustles the leaves, which are sometimes dyed a brilliant gold. Meanwhile, in the garden, buds appear on the flowers, and colorful petals attract bees and butterflies, reminding us of the subtle transition from one season to the next.","Her voice was like a line from an old black-and-white Jean-Luc Godard movie, filtering in just beyond the frame of my consciousness.","One of these days they\'ll be making a film where the whole human race gets wiped out in a nuclear war, but everything works out in the end.","I do feel that I\u2019ve managed to make something I could maybe call my world\u2026over time\u2026little by little. And when I\u2019m inside it, to some extent, I feel kind of relieved. But the very fact I felt I had to make such a world probably means that I\u2019m a weak person, that I bruise easily, don\u2019t you think? And in the eyes of society at large, that world of mine is a puny little thing. It\u2019s like a cardboard house: a puff of wind might carry it off somewhere.","Forgive me for stating the obvious, but the world is made up of all kinds of people.","I wondered if she was trying to convey something to me, something she could not put into words - something prior to words that she could not grasp within herself and which therefore had no hope of ever turning into words.","Something inside me had dropped away, and nothing came in to fill the cavern.","Hatsumi had a pretty good idea that Nagasawa was sleeping around, but she never complained to him. She was seriously in love with him, but she never made demands. \'I don\'t deserve a girl like Hatsumi,\' Nagasawa once said to me. I had to agree with him.","When microorganisms die, they make oil; when huge timbers fall, they make coal. But everything here was pure, unadulterated rubbish that didn\'t make anything. Where does a busted videodeck get you?","What do we talk about? Just ordinary things. What happened today, or books we\'ve read, or tomorrow\'s weather, you know. Don\'t tell me you\'re wondering if people jump to their feet and shout stuff like \'It\'ll rain tomorrow if a polar bear eats the stars tonight!","It\'s a quiet place, so people talk quietly,\\" said Naoko. She made a neat pile of fish bones at the edge of her plate and dabbed at her mouth with a handkerchief. \\"There\'s no need to raise your voice here. You don\'t have to convince anybody of anything, and you don\'t have to attract anyone\'s attention.","I found a Bill Evans record in the bookcase and was listening to it while drying my hair when I realized that it was the record I had played in Naoko\'s room on the night of her birthday, the night she cried and I took her in my arms. That had happened only six months earlier, but it felt like something from a much remoter past. Maybe it felt that way because I had thought about it so often-too often, to the point where it had distorted my sense of time.","When it\'s raining like this,\\" said Naoko, \\"it feels as if we\'re the only ones in the world. I wish it would just keep raining so the three of us could stay together.","Hey, what is it with you? Why are you so spaced out? You still haven\'t answered me.\\" I probably still haven\'t completely adapted to the world,\\" I said after giving it some thought. \\"I don\'t know, I feel like this isn\'t the real world. The people, the scene: they just don\'t seem real to me.\\" Midori rested an elbow on the bar and looked at me. \\"There was something like that in a Jim Morrison song, I\'m pretty sure.\\" People are strange when you\'re a stranger.","I closed my eyes and tried to sleep. But it was not until much later that I was able to get any real sleep. In a place far away from anyone or anywhere, I drifted off for a moment.","I wrote a huge number of letters that spring: one a week to Naoko, several to Reiko, and several more to Midori. I wrote letters in the classroom, I wrote letters at my desk at home with Seagull in my lap, I wrote letters at empty tables during my breaks at the Italian restaurant. It was as if I were writing letters to hold together the pieces of my crumbling life.","Where I went in my travels, it\'s impossible for me to recall. I remember the sights and sounds and smells clearly enough, but the names of the towns are gone, as well as any sense of the order in which I traveled from place to place.","Sitting on the floor, I\'d replay the past in my head. Funny, that\'s all I did, day after day after day for half a year, and I never tired of it. What I\'d been through seemed so vast, with so many facets. Vast, but real, very real, which was why the experience persisted in towering before me, like a monument lit up at night. And the thing was, it was a monument to me.","Thanks to the long days of rain, the blades of grass glowed with a deep-green luster, and they gave off the smell of wildness unique to things that sink their roots into the earth.","It might not be perfect, but the fundamental stance I adopted with regard to my home was to accept it, problems and all, because it was something I myself had chosen. If it had problems, these were almost certainly problems that had originated within me.","Time expands, then contracts, all in tune with the stirrings of the heart.","The others in the dorm thought I wanted to be a writer, because I was always alone with a book, but I had no such ambition. There was nothing I wanted to be.","In his own way, he\'s lived life with all the intensity he could muster.","A life without pain: it was the very thing I had dreamed of for years, but now that I had it, I couldn\u2019t find a place for myself within it. A clear gap separated me from it, and this caused me great confusion. I felt as if I were not anchored to this world - this world that I had hated so passionately until then; this world that I had continued to revile for its unfairness and injustice; this world where at least I knew who I was. Now the world ceased to be the world, and I had ceased to be me.","I am struck by how, except when you\'re young, you really need to prioritize in life, figuring out in what order you should divide up your time and energy. If you don\'t get that sort of system set by a certain age, you\'ll lack focus and your life will be out of balance.","I laughed. \u201cYou\u2019re too young to be so \u2026 pessimistic,\u201d I said, using the English word. \u201cPessi-what?\u201d \u201cPessimistic. It means looking only at the dark side of things.\u201d \u201cPessimistic \u2026 pessimistic \u2026\u201d She repeated the English to herself over and over, and then she looked up at me with a fierce glare. \u201cI\u2019m only sixteen,\u201d she said, \u201cand I don\u2019t know much about the world, but I do know one thing for sure. If I\u2019m pessimistic, then the adults in this world who are not pessimistic are a bunch of idiots.","Like you\'re riding a train at night across some vast plain, and you catch a glimpse of a tiny light in a window of a farmhouse. In an instant it\'s sucked back into the darkness behind and vanishes. But if you close your eyes, that point of light stays with you, just barely for a few moments.","Artists are those who can evade the verbose.","I don\u2019t know what it means to live.","But knowing what I don\u2019t want to do doesn\u2019t help me figure out what I do want to do. I could do just about anything if somebody made me. But I don\u2019t have an image of the one thing I really want to do. That\u2019s my problem now. I can\u2019t find the image.","I stare at this ceaseless, rushing crowd and imagine a time a hundred years from now. In a hundred years everybody here-me included-will have disappeared from the face of the earth and turned into ashes or dust. A weird thought, but everything in front of me starts to seem unreal, like a gust of wind could blow it all away.","It feels like everything\'s been decided in advance that I\'m following a path somebody else has already mapped out for me. It doesn\'t matter how much I think things over, how much effort I put into it. In fact, the harder I try, the more I lose my sense of who I am. It\'s like my identity\'s an orbit that I\'ve strayed far away from, and that really hurts. But more than that, it scares me. Just thinking about it makes me flinch.","Sometimes, however, this sense of isolation, like acid spilling out of a bottle, can unconsciously eat away at a person\u2019s heart and dissolve it.","I\'m not sure if I could tell the difference\u2014between just staring into space and thinking. We\'re usually thinking all the time, aren\'t we? Not that we live in order to think, but the opposite isn\'t true either\u2014that we think in order to live. I believe, contrary to Descartes, that we sometimes think in order not to be. Staring into space might unintentionally have the opposite effect.","No matter how clear things might become in the forest of story, there was never a clear-cut solution, as there was in math. The role of a story was, in the broadest terms, to transpose a problem into another form. Depending on the nature and the direction of the problem, a solution might be suggested in the narrative. Tengo would return to the real world with that solution in hand. It was like a piece of paper bearing the indecipherable text of a magic spell. It served no immediate practical purpose, but it contained a possibility.","A poet might die at twenty-one, a revolutionary or a rock star at twenty four. But after that you assume everything\u2019s going to be all right. you\u2019ve made it past Dead Man\u2019s Curve and you\u2019re out of the tunnel, cruising straight for your destination down a six lane highway whether you want it or not.","That\'s wrong,\\" she declared. \\"Everyone must have one thing that they can excel at. It\'s just a matter of drawing it out, isn\'t it? But school doesn\'t know how to draw it out. It crushes the gift. It\'s no wonder most people never get to be what they want to be. They just get ground down.","As long as I stared at the clock, at least the world remained in motion. Not a very consequential world, but in motion nonetheless. And as long as I knew the world was still in motion, I knew I existed. Not a very consequential existence, but an existence nonetheless. It struck me as wanting that someone should confirm his own existence only by the hands of an electric wall clock. There had to be a more cognitive means of confirmation. But try as I might, nothing less facile came to mind.","You know what girls are like. They turn twenty or twenty-one and all of a sudden they start having these concrete ideas. They get super realistic. And when that happens, everything that seemed so sweet and lovable about them begins to look ordinary and depressing.","Everybody feels safe belonging not to the excluded minority but to the excluding majority. You think, Oh, I\u2019m glad that\u2019s not me. It\u2019s basically the same in all periods in all societies. If you belong to the majority, you can avoid thinking about lots of troubling things.","Waiting for your answer is one of the most painful things I have ever been through. At least let me know whether or not I hurt you.","In his or her own way, everyone I saw before me looked happy. Whether they were really happy or just looked it, I couldn\'t tell. But they did look happy on this pleasant early afternoon in late September, and because of that I felt a kind of loneliness new to me, as if I were the only one here who was not truly part of the scene.","He appeared before me and departed. We were not able to speak to or touch each other. But in that short interval, he transformed many things inside me. He literally stirred my mind and body the way a spoon stirs a cup of cocoa, down to the depths of my internal organs and my womb.","Something in her small eyes caught the sunlight and glistened, like a glacier on the faraway face of a mountain.","You can\u2019t look too far ahead. Do that and you\u2019ll lose sight of what you\u2019re doing and stumble. I\u2019m not saying you should focus solely on the details right in front of you, mind you. You\u2019ve got to look ahead a bit or else you\u2019ll bump into something. You\u2019ve got to conform to the proper order and at the same time keep an eye out for what\u2019s ahead. That\u2019s critical, no matter what you\u2019re doing.","It\'s just that you\'re about to do something out of the ordinary. And after you do something like that, the everyday look of things might seem to change a little. Things may look different to you than they did before. But don\'t let appearances fool you. There\'s always only one reality.","How about Proust\'s In Search of Lost Time?\\" Tamaru asked. \\"If you\'ve never read it this would be a good opportunity to read the whole thing.\\" \\"Have you read it?\\" \\"No, I haven\'t been in jail, or had to hide out for a long time. Someone once said unless you have those kinds of opportunities, you can\'t read the whole of Proust.","You said you\'re going far away,\\" Tamaru said. \\"How far away are we talking about?\\" \\"It\'s a distance that can\'t be measured.\\" \\"Like the distance that separates one person\'s heart from another\'s.","I\'m not trying to imply I can keep up this silent, isolated facade all the time. Sometimes the wall I\'ve erected around me comes crumbling down. It doesn\'t happen very often, but sometimes, before I even realize what\'s going on, there I am--naked and defenseless and totally confused. At times like that I always feel an omen calling out to me, like a dark, omnipresent pool of water. ~page 10","Writing talent is similar to the art of chatting up a girl. You can improve to a certain degree through practice, but basically you are either born with it or you aren\'t.","The grounds of the place were dominated by several large, old willow trees that towered over the surrounding stone wall and swayed soundlessly in the wind like lost souls.","The facts and techniques or whatever they teach you in class isn\'t going to be veryuseful in the real world, that\'s for sure.","As long as possible, I would really like to complete one marathon per year. Though my time has been slowing down as I get older, it has become a very important part of my life.","The honour of physical decline is waiting, and you have to get used to that reality.","If you keep on writing for three years, every day, you should be strong. Of course, you have to be strong mentally, also. But in the first place, you have to be strong physically. That is a\\n very important thing. Physically and mentally you have to be strong.","Everything. Things you lost. Things you\u2019re gonna lose. Everything. Here\u2019s where it all ties together.","I just feel pain. A lot of pain. I thought I could imagine how much this would hurt but I was wrong.","I have no idea! I have been writing for 35 years and from the beginning up to now the situation\'s almost the same. I\'m kind of an ugly duckling. Always the duckling, never the swan.","What gave money its true meaning was its dark-night namelessness, its breathtaking interchangeability.","I\'m not human. I\'m a piece of machinery. I don\'t need to feel a thing. Just forge on ahead.","It is very simple, actually. It is because you and Tengo were so powerfully drawn to each other.","If she did experience sex-or something close to it-in high school, I\'m sure it would have been less out of sexual desire or love than literary curiosity.","Writing a long novel is like survival training. Physical strength is as necessary as artistic sensitivity.","Most of what I know about writing I\'ve learned through running every day.","I bet the reason people are afraid of going bald is because it makes them think of the end of life. I mean, when your hair starts to thin, it must feel as if your life is being worn away ... as if you\'ve taken a giant step in the direction of death, the last Big Consumption.","Good style happens in one of two ways: the writer either has an inborn talent or is willing to work herself to death to get it.","The best thing would be to break your neck, but you\'d probably just break your leg and then you couldn\'t do a thing. You\'d yell at the top of your lungs, but nobody;d hear you, and you couldn\'t expect anybody to find you, and you\'d have centipedes and spiders crawling all over you, and the bones of the ones who died before are scattered all around you, and it\'s dark and soggy, and way overhead there\'s this tiny, tiny circle of light like a winter moon. You die there in this place, little by little, all by yourself.","You know, the usual story. Once upon a time I was playing my harp by a spring when a fairy appeared out of nowhere, handed me a Beretta Model 92, and told me to shoot the white rabbit over there for target practice.","It was a narrow world, a world that was standing still. But the narrower it became, the more it betook of stillness, the more this world that enveloped me seemed to overflow with things and people that could only be called strange. They had been there all the while, it seemed, waiting in the shadows for me to stop moving. And every time the wind-up bird came to my yard to wind its spring, the world descendedmore deeply into chaos.","Listen to this, Nimit. Follow Coleman Hawkins\' improvised lines very carefully. He is using them to tell us something. Pay very close attention. He is telling us the story of the free spirit that is doing everything it can to escape from within him. That same kind of spirit is inside me, inside you. There-you can hear it, I\'m sure: the hot breath, the shivering heart. (Thailand)","I myself, as I\'m writing, don\'t know who did it. The readers and I are on the same ground. When I start to write a story, I don\'t know the conclusion at all and I don\'t know what\'s going to happen next. If there is a murder case as the first thing, I don\'t know who the killer is. I write the book because I would like to find out. If I know who the killer is, there\'s no purpose to writing the story.","Sex is an extremely subtle undertaking, unlike going to the department store on a Sunday to buy a thermos.","You know, eating\'s much more important than most people think. There comes a time in your life when you\'ve just got to have something super-delicious. And when you\'re standing at that crossroads your whole life can change, depending on which one you go into - the good restaurant or the awful one.","While they\'re still alive, people can become ghosts.","You\u2019re really cute, Midori,\u201d I corrected myself. \u201cWhat do you mean really cute?\u201d \u201cSo cute the mountains crumble and the oceans dry up.","Tell me how you could say such a thing, she said, staring down at the ground beneath her feet. You\'re not telling me anything I don\'t know already. \'Relax your body, and the rest of you will lighten up.\' What\'s the point of saying that to me? If I relaxed my body now, I\'d fall apart. I\'ve always lived like this, and it\'s the only way I know how to go on living. If I relaxed for a second, I\'d never find my way back. I\'d go to pieces, and the pieces would be blown away. Why can\'t you see that? How can you talk about watching over me if you can\'t see that?","I\'m not going to get involved in a debate with you. Just remember this: the gods give, and the gods take away. Even if you are not aware of having been granted what you posses, the gods remember what they gave you. They don\'t forget a thing. You should use the abilities you have been granted with the utmost care.","The young man knows that he is irretrievably lost. This is no town of cats, he finally realizes. It is the place where he is meant to be lost. It is another world, which has been prepared especially for him. And never again, for all eternity, will the train stop at this station to take him back to the world he came from.","I was in my house, alone in the living room, anxious about you, watching the flashes of lightning. And a flash of lightning lit up this truth for me, right in front of my eye. That night i lost you, I lost something inside me. Or perhaps several things. Something central to my existence, the very support for who I am as a person","I was dying. Like all the other people who live in this world.","An expectation was there, mixed in with so many other emotions - excitement, resignation, hesitation, confusion, fear - that would well up then wither on the vine. You\'re optimistic one moment, only to be racked the next by the certainty that it will all fall to pieces. And in the end it does.","Sometimes when I\'m with you, I remember things I lost when I was your age. Like I remember the sound of the rain and the smell of the wind.","I have these realistic dreams and snap wide awake in the middle of the night. And for a while I can\'t work out what\'s real and what isn\'t... That kind of feeling. Do you have any idea what I\'m saying?","I\'m always tripped up by the eternal who am I?","Human beings are ultimately nothing but carriers-passageways- for genes. They ride us into the ground like racehorses from generation to generation. Genes don\'t think about what constitutes good or evil. They don\'t care whether we are happy or unhappy. We\'re just means to an end for them. The only thing they think about is what is most efficient for them.","I\u2019ve had that kind of experience myself: I\u2019m looking at a map and I see someplace that makes me think, \u2018I absolutely have to go to this place, no matter what\u2019. And most of the time, for some reason, the place is far away and hard to get to. I feel this overwhelming desire to know what kind of scenery the place has, or what people are doing there. It\u2019s like measles - you can\u2019t show other people exactly where the passion comes from. It\u2019s curiosity in the purest sense. An inexplicable inspiration.","Whenever I get into something, I shut out everything else.","I think certain types of processes don\u2019t allow for any variation. If you have to be part of that process, all you can do is transform\u2014or perhaps distort\u2014yourself through that persistent repetition, and make that process a part of your own personality.","It seems to me that very sad things always contain an element of the comical","Of course you got rights, the law\'s on your side, but sometimes the law takes a long time to kick in and so it gets put in the hands of us poor suckers on duty. You get my drift?","The house kept its own time, like the old-fashioned grandfather clock in the living room. People who happened by raised the weights, and as long as the weights were wound, the clock continued ticking away. But with people gone and the weights unattended, whole chunks of time were left to collect in deposits of faded life on the floor.","You could be anybody when you\'re writing. That\'s the reason that I\'m writing: to be anybody. You can put your feet in various shoes and experience anything.","In my younger days, I was trying to write sophisticated prose and fantastic stories.","Everything just blows me away.","So what\u2019s wrong if there happens to be one guy in the world who enjoys trying to understand you?","How many Sundays - how many hundreds of Sundays like this - lay ahead of me? \u201cQuiet, peaceful, and lonely,\u201d I said aloud to myself. On Sundays, I didn\'t wind my spring.","sometimes i\'d wake up at two or three in the morning and not be able to fall asleep again. i\'d get out of bed, go to the kitchen, and pour myself a whiskey. glass in hand, i\'d look down at the darkened cemetary across teh way and the headlights of the cars on the road. the moments of time linking night and dawn were long and dark. if i could cry, it might make things easier. but what would i cry over? i was too self centered to cry for other people, too old to cry for myself.","The best musicians transpose consciousness into sound; painters do the same for color and shape.","Once, when I was younger, I thought I could be someone else. I\'d move to Casablanca, open a bar, and I\'d meet Ingrid Bergman. Or more realistically - whether actually more realistic or not - I\'d tune in on a better life, something more suited to my true self. Toward that end, I had to undergo training. I read The Greening of America, and I saw Easy Rider three times. But like a boat with a twisted rudder, I kept coming back to the same place. I wasn\'t anywhere. I was myself, waiting on the shore for me to return.","The problem was, I think, that the places I fit in were always falling behind the rimes.","I\u2019m not good at talking,\u201d Naoko said. \u201cHaven\u2019t been for the longest while. I start to say something and the wrong words come out. Wrong or sometimes completely backward. I try to go back and correct it, but things get even more complicated and confused, so that I don\u2019t even remember what I started to say in the first place. Like I was split into two or something, one half chasing the other. And there\u2019s this big pillar in the middle and they go chasing each other around and around it. The other me always latches onto the right word and this me absolutely never catches up","The little things are important, Mr. Wind-Up Bird.","I think that my job is to observe people and the world, and not to judge them. I always hope to position myself away from so-called conclusions. I would like to leave everything wide open to all the possibilities in the world.","Exhaustion pays no mind to age or beauty. Like rain and earthquakes and hail and floods.","In traveling, a companion, in life, compassion,\'\\" she repeats, making sure of it. If she had paper and pencil, it wouldn\'t surprise me if she wrote it down. \\"So what does that really mean? In simple terms.\\" I think it over. It takes me a while to gather my thoughts, but she waits patiently. \\"I think it means,\\" I say, \\"that chance encounters are what keep us going. In simple terms.","My only passions were books and music. As you might guess, I led a lonely life\u2026 Not that I knew what I wanted in life - I didn\u2019t. I loved reading novels to distraction, but didn\u2019t write well enough to be a novelist; being an editor or a critic was out, too, since my tastes ran to the extremes. Novels should be for pure personal enjoyment, I decided, not part of your work or study. That\u2019s why I didn\u2019t study literature","let the wind change direction a little bit, and their cries turned to whispers.","That\'s good. I was worried. Of course, I do have a few things wrong with me, but those are strictly problems I keep inside. I\'d hate to think they were obvious to anybody else. Especially at the swimming pool in the summer.","That\'s the kind of death that frightens me. The shadow of death slowly, slowly eats away at the region of life, and before you know it everything\'s dark and you can\'t see, and the people around you think of you as more dead than alive.","It\'s my motto for life. \'Walk slowly; drink lots of water.","Nature is actually unnatural","The world in books seemed so much more alive to me than anything outside. I could see things I\'d never seen before. Books and music were my best friends. I had a couple of good friends at school, but never met anyone I could really speak my heart to.","Results aside, the ability to have complete faith in another human being is one of the finest qualities a person can possess.","One last word of advice, though, Mr. Okada, though you may not want to hear this. There are things in this world it is better not to know about. Of course, those are the very things that people most want to know about. It\'s strange.","And when you come back to Japan next summer, let\'s have that date or whatever you want to call it. We can go to the zoo or the botanical garden or the aquarium, and then we\'ll have the most politically correct and scrumptious omelets we can find.","In the end, like so many beautiful promises in our lives, that dinner date never came to be.","Time moves in it special way in the middle of the night.","I think most people live in fiction...That\'s how you keep your fragile body intact.","And it was the kind of thing that loses the most important nuances when reduced to words. He had never told anyone about it, and he probably never would.","I tell you, Mr. Okada, a cold beer at the end of the day is the best thing life has to offer. Some choosy people say that a too cold beer doesn\'t taste good, but I couldn\'t disagree more. The first beer should be so cold you can\'t even taste it. The second one should be a little less chilled, but I want that first one to be like ice. I want it to be so cold my temples throb with pain. This is my own personal preference of course.","I write weird stories. I don\'t know why I like weirdness so much ... But when I write, I write weird. That\'s very strange. When I\'m getting more and more serious, I\'m getting more and more weird.","Reality\'s just the accumulation of ominous prophecies come to life. All you have to do is open a newspaper on any given day to weigh the good news versus the bad news, and you\'ll see what I mean.","Team sports aren\'t my thing. I find it easier to pick something up if I can do it at my own speed. And you don\'t need a partner to go running, you don\'t need a particular place, like in tennis, just a pair of trainers.","Even when I ran my bar I followed the same policy. A lot of customers came to the bar. If one in ten enjoyed the place and said he\'d come again, that was enough. If one out of ten was a repeat customer, then the business would survive. To put it another way, it didn\'t matter if nine out of ten didn\'t like my bar. This realization lifted a weight off my shoulders. Still, I had to make sure that the one person who did like the place.","I can\'t understand nothingness. I can\'t understand it and I can\'t imagine it.","I am 55 years old now. It takes three years to write one book. I don\'t know how many books I will be able to write before I die. It is like a countdown. So with each book I am praying - please let me live until I am finished.","Grandfather always said school\u2019s a place where they take sixteen years to wear down your brain. Grandfather hardly went to school either.","Life might just be an absurd, even crude, chain of events and nothing more.","There\'s an essential order you have to follow in everything. It\'s a way of showing respect, following everything in the correct order.","Maybe time is nothing at all like a straight line. Perhaps it\'s shaped like a twisted doughnut. But for tens of thousands of years, people have probably been seeing time as a straight line that continues on forever. And that\'s the concept they based their actions on. And until now they haven\'t found anything inconvenient or contradictory about it. So as an experiential model, it\'s probably correct.","My face, my self, what would they mean to anybody? Just another stiff. So this self of mine passes some other\'s self on the street - what do we have to say to each other? Hey there! Hi ya!That\'s about it. Nobody raises a hand. No one turns around to take another look.","Dreaming is the day job of novelists, but sharing our dreams is a still more important task for us. We cannot be novelists without this sense of sharing something.","I lost some of my friends because I got so famous, people who just assumed that I would be different now. I felt like everyone hated me. That is the most unhappy time of my life.","I never plan. I never know what the next page is going to be..... But that\'s the fun of writing a novel or a story, because I don\'t know what\'s going to happen next.","I always feel like I\'m struggling to become someone else. Like I\'m trying to find a new place, grab hold of a new life, a new personality. I guess it\'s part of growing up; it\'s also an attempt to reinvent myself.","The best point of my novels, I think, is their humor. I want to keep many my works humorous.","I have read all my novels that were translated into English. Reading my novels is enjoyable because I forget almost all the content in them.","It is my huge pleasure that my novels are translated into languages that are read among small numbers of people.","I write my novels personally, desperately and non-negligently. When I write my novels, I think about my novels only, and never do other works.","Kafka is one of my very favorite writers. Kafka\'s fictional world is already so complete that trying to follow in his steps is not just pointless, but quite risky, too. What I see myself doing, rather, is writing novels where, in my own way, I dismantle the fictional world of Kafka that itself dismantled the existing novelistic system.","What I\'d like to be is a unique writer who\'s different from everybody else. I want to be a writer who tells stories unlike other writers\'.","I don\'t know a whole lot about symbolism. There seems to me to be a potential danger in symbolism. I feel more comfortable with metaphors and similes.","Myths are the prototype for all stories. When we write a story on our own it can\'t help but link up with all sorts of myths. Myths are like a reservoir containing every story there is.","When I write a novel I put into play all the information inside me. It might be Japanese information or it might be Western; I don\'t draw a distinction between the two.","I can\'t imagine how American readers will react to a novel, but if the story is appealing it doesn\'t matter much if you don\'t catch all the detail. I\'m not too familiar with the geography of nineteenth century London, for instance, but I still enjoy reading Dickens.","I wrote my first two long novels and an anthology of short narratives, when I was a manager of my own jazz bar. There was not enough time to write and I didn\'t know how to write novels. Therefore, I made written collages of aphorisms and rags.","All things in my novels are real for me. Some western critics said that Garcia Marquez\'s novels are magic realism. However, I believe that Marquez must have experienced everything in his novels.","I\'ve translated a lot of American literature into Japanese, and I think that what makes a good translator is, above all, a feel for language and also a great affection for the work you\'re translating. If one of those elements is missing the translation won\'t be worth much.","Adults need more complex narratives. They have their own narratives. The main characters are themselves.","It is however, difficult to make your narratives relative by yourself. A novelists\' work is to provide models to make your narratives relative. If you read my novels then you may feel, \\"I have the same experience as this narrative\\", or \\"I have the same idea as this novel\\". It means that your narrative and mine sympathize, concord and resonate together.","Exerting yourself to the limit over and over again, that is the essence of running. Running is painful, but the pain doesn\'t leave me, I can take care of it. That agrees with my mentality.","Sometimes I find it too hot to run, and sometimes too cold. Or too cloudy. But I still go running. I know that if I didn\'t go running, I wouldn\'t go the next day either. It\'s not in human nature to take unnecessary burdens upon oneself, so one\'s body soon becomes disaccustomed. It mustn\'t do that. It\'s the same with writing. I write every day so that my mind doesn\'t become disaccustomed.","Running taught me to have faith in my skills as a writer. I learned how much I can demand of myself, when I need a break, and when the break starts to get too long. I known how hard I am allowed to push myself.","What happens when people open their hearts?\\"\\"They get better.","Sometimes fate is like a small sandstorm that keeps changing directions. You change direction but the sandstorm chases you. You turn again, but the storm adjusts. Over and over you play this out, like some ominous dance with death just before dawn. Why? Because this storm isn\'t something that blew in from far away, something that has nothing to do with you. This storm is you. Something inside of you. So all you can do is give in to it, step right inside the storm, closing your eyes and plugging up your ears so the sand doesn\'t get in, and walk through it, step by step. There\'s no sun there, no moon, no direction, no sense of time. Just fine white sand swirling up into the sky like pulverized bones. That\'s the kind of sandstorm you need to imagine.And you really will have to make it through that violent, metaphysical, symbolic storm. No matter how metaphysical or symbolic it might be, make no mistake about it: it will cut through flesh like a thousand razor blades. People will bleed there, and you will bleed too. Hot, red blood. You\'ll catch that blood in your hands, your own blood and the blood of others.And once the storm is over you won\'t remember how you made it through, how you managed to survive. You won\'t even be sure, in fact, whether the storm is really over. But one thing is certain. When you come out of the storm you won\'t be the same person who walked in. That\'s what this storm\'s all about.","Don\'t feel sorry for yourself. Only assholes do that.","Sometimes when I look at you, I feel I\'m gazing at a distant star. It\'s dazzling, but the light is from tens of thousands of years ago.Maybe the star doesn\'t even exist any more. Yet sometimes that light seems more real to me than anything.","Listen up - there\'s no war that will end all wars.","Is it possible, in the final analysis, for one human being to achieve perfect understanding of another?We can invest enormous time and energy in serious efforts to know another person, but in the end, how close can we come to that person\'s essence? We convince ourselves that we know the other person well, but do we really know anything important about anyone?","here she is, all mine, trying her best to give me all she can. How could I ever hurt her? But I didn\u2019t understand then. That I could hurt somebody so badly she would never recover. That a person can, just by living, damage another human being beyond repair.","Sometimes I feel so- I don\u2019t know - lonely. The kind of helpless feeling when everything you\u2019re used to has been ripped away. Like there\u2019s no more gravity, and I\u2019m left to drift in outer space with no idea where I\u2019m going\u2019Like a little lost Sputnik?\u2019I guess so.","Only the Dead stay seventeen forever.","I really like you, Midori. A lot.\u201cHow much is a lot?\u201d\u201cLike a spring bear,\u201d I said.\u201cA spring bear?\u201d Midori looked up again. \u201cWhat\u2019s that all about? A spring bear.\u201d\u201cYou\u2019re walking through a field all by yourself one day in spring, and this sweet little bear cub with velvet fur and shiny little eyes comes walking along. And he says to you, \u201cHi, there, little lady. Want to tumble with me?\u2019 So you and the bear cub spend the whole day in each other\u2019s arms, tumbling down this clover-covered hill. Nice, huh?\u201d\u201cYeah. Really nice.\u201d\u201cThat\u2019s how much I like you.\u201d","If you\'re in pitch blackness, all you can do is sit tight until your eyes get used to the dark","You know what I think?\\" she says. \\"That people\'s memories are maybe the fuel they burn to stay alive. Whether those memories have any actual importance or not, it doesn\'t matter as far as the maintenance of life is concerned. They\'re all just fuel. Advertising fillers in the newspaper, philosophy books, dirty pictures in a magazine, a bundle of ten-thousand-yen bills: when you feed \'em to the fire, they\'re all just paper. The fire isn\'t thinking \'Oh, this is Kant,\' or \'Oh, this is the Yomiuri evening edition,\' or \'Nice tits,\' while it burns. To the fire, they\'re nothing but scraps of paper. It\'s the exact same thing. Important memories, not-so-important memories, totally useless memories: there\'s no distinction--they\'re all just fuel.","Here\'s what I think, Mr. Wind-Up Bird,\\" said May Kasahara. \\"Everybody\'s born with some different thing at the core of their existence. And that thing, whatever it is, becomes like a heat source that runs each person from the inside. I have one too, of course. Like everybody else. But sometimes it gets out of hand. It swells or shrinks inside me, and it shakes me up. What I\'d really like to do is find a way to communicate that feeling to another person. But I can\'t seem to do it. They just don\'t get it. Of course, the problem could be that I\'m not explaining it very well, but I think it\'s because they\'re not listening very well. They pretend to be listening, but they\'re not, really. So I get worked up sometimes, and I do some crazy things.","Most things are forgotten over time. Even the war itself, the life-and-death struggle people went through is now like something from the distant past. We\u2019re so caught up in our everyday lives that events of the past are no longer in orbit around our minds. There are just too many things we have to think about everyday, too many new things we have to learn. But still, no matter how much time passes, no matter what takes place in the interim, there are some things we can never assign to oblivion, memories we can never rub away. They remain with us forever, like a touchstone.","Being with her I feel a pain, like a frozen knife stuck in my chest. An awful pain, but the funny thing is I\'m thankful for it. It\'s like that frozen pain and my very existence are one.The pain is an anchor, mooring me here.","You can hide memories, but you can\'t erase the history that produced them.","I was always attracted not by some quantifiable, external beauty, but by something deep down, something absolute. Just as some people have a secret love for rainstorms, earthquakes, or blackouts, I liked that certain undefinable something directed my way by members of the opposite sex. For want of a better word, call it magnetism. Like it or not, it\u2019s a kind of power that snares people and reels them in.","If you can\'t understand it without an explanation, you can\'t understand it with an explanation.","Body cells replace themselves every month. Even at this very moment. Most everything you think you know about me is nothing more than memories.","Memory is a funny thing. When I was in the scene, I hardly paid it any mind. I never stopped to think of it as something that would make a lasting impression, certainly never imagined that eighteen years later I would recall it in such detail. I didn\'t give a damn about the scenery that day. I was thinking about myself. I was thinking about the beautiful girl walking next to me. I was thinking about the two of us together, and then about myself again. It was the age, that time of life when every sight, every feeling, every thought came back, like a boomerang, to me. And worse, I was in love. Love with complications. The scenery was the last thing on my mind.","According to Aristophanes in Plato\'s The Banquet, in the ancient world of legend there were three types of people.In ancient times people weren\'t simply male or female, but one of three types : male/male, male/female or female/female. In other words, each person was made out of the components of two people. Everyone was happy with this arrangment and never really gave it much thought. But then God took a knife and cut everyone in half, right down the middle. So after that the world was divided just into male and female, the upshot being that people spend their time running around trying to locate their missing half.","People sometimes sneer at those who run every day, claiming they\u2019ll go to any length to live longer. But I don\u2019t think that\u2019s the reason most people run. Most runners run not because they want to live longer, but because they want to live life to the fullest. If you\u2019re going to while away the years, it\u2019s far better to live them with clear goals and fully alive than in a fog, and I believe running helps you do that. Exerting yourself to the fullest within your individual limits: that\u2019s the essence of running, and a metaphor for life\u2014and for me, for writing as well. I believe many runners would agree.","I made up my mind I was going to find someone who would love me unconditionally three hundred and sixty five days a year, I was still in elementary school at the time - fifth or sixth grade - but I made up my mind once and for all.\u201cWow,\u201d I said. \u201cDid the search pay off?\u201d\u201cThat\u2019s the hard part,\u201d said Midori. She watched the rising smoke for a while, thinking. \u201cI guess I\u2019ve been waiting so long I\u2019m looking for perfection. That makes it tough.\u201d\u201cWaiting for the perfect love?\u201d\u201cNo, even I know better than that. I\u2019m looking for selfishness. Perfect selfishness. Like, say I tell you I want to eat strawberry shortcake. And you stop everything you\u2019re doing and run out and buy it for me. And you come back out of breath and get down on your knees and hold this strawberry shortcake out to me. And I say I don\u2019t want it anymore and throw it out the window.

Do you know what I\'m getting at? People are drawn deeper into tragedy not by their defects but by their virtues....[But] we accept irony through a device called metaphor. And through that we grow and become deeper human beings.","I look up at the sky, wondering if I\'ll catch a glimpse of kindness there, but I don\'t. All I see are indifferent summer clouds drifting over the Pacific. And they have nothing to say to me. Clouds are always taciturn. I probably shouldn\'t be looking up at them. What I should be looking at is inside of me. Like staring down into a deep well. Can I see kindness there? No, all I see is my own nature. My own individual, stubborn, uncooperative often self-centered nature that still doubts itself--that, when troubles occur, tries to find something funny, or something nearly funny, about the situation. I\'ve carried this character around like an old suitcase, down a long, dusty path. I\'m not carrying it because I like it. The contents are too heavy, and it looks crummy, fraying in spots. I\'ve carried it with me because there was nothing else I was supposed to carry. Still, I guess I have grown attached to it. As you might expect.","So I made up my mind I was going to find someone who would love me unconditionally three hundred and sixty-five days a year.Watanabe: Wow, and did your search pay off?M: That\'s the hard part.

We draw ever nearer to theend of our allotted span of time, bidding it farewell as it trails offbehind. Repeating, often adroitly, the endless deeds of the everyday. Leaving behind a feeling of insurmountable emptiness...Maybe, in some distant place, everything is already, quietly, lost.Or at least there exists a silent place where everything candisappear, melting together in a single, overlapping figure. And aswe live our lives we discover - drawing toward us the thin threadsattached to each - what has been lost. I closed my eyes and tried tobring to mind as many beautiful lost things as I could. Drawing themcloser, holding on to them. Knowing all the while that their livesare fleeting.","This is one more piece of advice I have for you: don\'t get impatient. Even if things are so tangled up you can\'t do anything, don\'t get desperate or blow a fuse and start yanking on one particular thread before it\'s ready to come undone.

Try to imagine this: You\'re a farmer, living all alone on the Siberian tundra. Day after day you plow your fields. As far as the eye can see, nothing. To the north, the horizon, to the east, the horizon, to the south, to the west, more of the same. Every morning, when the sun rises in the east, you go out to work in your fields. When it\'s directly overhead, you take a break for lunch. When it sinks in the west, you go home to sleep. And then one day, something inside you dies. Day after day you watch the sun rise in the east, pass across the sky, then sink in the west, and something breaks inside you and dies. You toss your plow aside and, your head completely empty of thought, begin walking toward the west. Heading toward a land that lies west of the sun. Like someone, possessed, you walk on, day after day, not eating or drinking, until you collapse on the ground and die. That\'s hysteria siberiana.","I\'ve been lonely for so long.

It must have witnessed all of the phenomena occurring - and all of the acts carried out - on this earth. But the moon remained silent; it told no stories.

I\'m not after a wall that\'ll repel power coming from outside. What I want is the kind of strength to be able to absorb that kind of power, to stand up to it. The strength to quietly endure things - unfairness, misfortunes, sadness, mistakes, misunderstandings.","Every once in a while she\'ll get worked up and cry like that. But that\'s ok.

If a pistol appears, it has to be fired at some point. Chekhov liked to write stories that did away with all useless ornamentation.","Jealousy\u2014at least as far as he understood it from his dream\u2014was the most hopeless prison in the world. Jealousy was not a place he was forced into by someone else, but a jail in which the inmate entered voluntarily, locked the door, and threw away the key. And not another soul in the world knew he was locked inside. Of course if he wanted to escape he could do so. The prison, was after all, his own heart. But he couldn\'t make that decision. His heart was as hard as a stone wall. This was the very essence of jealousy.","Waiting for youranswer is one of the most painful things I have ever been through. Atleast let me know whether or not I hurt you.","And you know, this thought crossed my mind at the time: maybe chance is a pretty common thing after all. Those kinds of coincidences are happening all around us, all the time, but most of them don\'t attract our attention and we just let them go by. It\'s like fireworks in the daytime. You might hear a faint sound, but even if you look up at the sky you can\'t see a thing. But if we\'re really hoping something may come true it may become visible, like a message rising to the surface. Then we\'re able to make it out clearly, decipher what it means. And seeing it before us we\'re surprised and wonder at how strange things like this can happen.

Each day would dawn without incident and end as it had begun. It rained a lot in September. October had several warm, sweaty days. Aside from the weather, there was hardly anything to distinguish one day from the next. I worked at concentrating my attention on the real and useful. I would go to the pool almost every day for a long swim, take walks, make myself three meals.But even so, every now and then I would feel a violent stab of loneliness. The very water I drank, the very air I breathed, would feel like long, sharp needles. The pages of a book in my hands would take on the threatening metallic gleam of razor blades. I could hear the roots of loneliness creeping through me when the world was hushed at four o\'clock in the morning.","I know I have a pretty good sense for music, but she was better than me. I used to think it was such a waste! I thought, \u2018If only she had started out with a good teacher and gotten the proper training, she\u2019d be so much further along!\u2019 But I was wrong about that. She was not the kind of child who could stand proper training. There just happen to be people like that. They\u2019re blessed with this marvelous talent, but they can\u2019t make the effort to systematize it. They end up squandering it in little bits and pieces. I\u2019ve seen my share of people like that. At first you think they\u2019re amazing. Like, they can sight-read some terrifically difficult piece and do a damn good job playing it all the way through. You see them do it, and you\u2019re overwhelmed. you think, \u2018I could never do that in a million years.\u2019 But that\u2019s as far as they go. They can\u2019t take it any further. And why not? Because they won\u2019t put in the effort. Because they haven\u2019t had the discipline pounded into them. They\u2019ve been spoiled. They have just enough talent so they\u2019ve been able to play things well without any effort and they\u2019ve had people telling them how great they are from the time they\u2019re little, so hard work looks stupid to them. They\u2019ll take some piece another kid has to work on for three weeks and polish it off in half the time, so the teacher figures they\u2019ve put enough into it and lets them go to the next thing. And they do that in half the time and go on to the next piece. They never find out what it means to be hammered by the teacher; they lose out on a certain element required or character building. It\u2019s a tragedy.","You said you\'re going far away,\\" Tamaru said. \\"How far away are we talking about?\\"\\"It\'s a distance that can\'t be measured.\\"\\"Like the distance that separates one person\'s heart from another\'s.","\u0647\u0646\u0627\u0643 \u0645\u062e\u0631\u062c.. \u0645\u0627\u062f\u0627\u0645\u062a \u0647\u0646\u0627\u0643 \u0625\u0631\u0627\u062f\u0629.","My peak? Would I even have one? I hardly had had anything you could call a life. A few ripples. some rises and falls. But that\'s it. Almost nothing. Nothing born of nothing. I\'d loved and been loved, but I had nothing to show. It was a singularly plain, featureless landscape. I felt like I was in a video game. A surrogate Pacman, crunching blindly through a labyrinth of dotted lines. The only certainty was my death.","We truly believed in something back then, and we knew we were the kind of people capable of believing in something - with all our hearts. And that kind of hope will never simply vanish.","I often recall these words when I am writing, and I think to myself, \u201cIt\u2019s true. There aren\u2019t any new words. Our job is to give new meanings and special overtones to absolutely ordinary words. I find the thought reassuring. It means that vast, unknown stretches still lie before us, fertile territories just waiting for us to cultivate them.\u201d","The human heart is like a night bird. Silently waiting for something, and when the time comes, it flies straight toward it.","Writing novels is much the same. You gather up bones and make your gate, but no matter how wonderful the gate might be, that alone doesn\'t make it a living breathing novel. A story is not something of this world. A real story requires a kind of magical baptism to link the world on this side with the world on the other side.","The right words always seemed to come too late.","Life is long, and sometimes cruel. Sometimes victims are needed. Someone has to take on that role. And human bodies are fragile, easily damaged. Cut them, and they bleed.","Let me tell you something, Mari. The ground we stand on looks solid enough, but if something happens it can drop right out from under you. And once that happens, you\'ve had it: things\'ll never be the same. All you can do is go on, living alone down there in the darkness...","Sometimes fate is like a small sandstorm that keeps changing directions. You change direction but the sandstorm chases you. You turn again, but the storm adjusts. Over and over you play this out, like some ominous dance with death just before dawn. Why? Because this storm isn\'t something that has nothing to do with you, This storm is you. Something inside you. So all you can do is give in to it, step right inside the storm, closing your eyes and plugging up your ears so the sand doesn\'t get in, and walk through it, step by step. There\'s no sun there, no moon, no direction, no sense of time. Just fine white sand swirling up the sky like pulverized bones.","When something bothered me, I didn\u2019t talk with anyone about it. I thought it over all by myself, came to a conclusion, and took action alone. Not that I really felt lonely. I thought that\u2019s just the way things are. Human beings, in the final analysis, have to survive on their own.","When I was fifteen, all I wanted was to go off to some other world, a place beyond anybody\u2019s reach. A place beyond the flow of time.- But there\u2019s no place like that in this world.- Exactly. Which is why I\u2019m living here, in this world where things are continually damaged, where the heart is fickle, where time flows past without a break.\u201d","\u0633\u0648\u0641 \u0623\u0638\u0644 \u0623\u062d\u0628\u0643 \u062f\u0627\u0626\u0645\u0627.. \u0648\u0644\u064a\u0633 \u0644\u0647\u0630\u0627 \u0639\u0644\u0627\u0642\u0629 \u0628\u0627\u0644\u0632\u0645\u0646.","Sometimes, when one is moving silently through such an utterly desolate landscape, an overwhelming hallucination can make one feel that oneself, as an individual human being, is slowly being unraveled. The surrounding space is so vast that it becomes increasingly difficult to keep a balanced grip on one\'s own being. The mind swells out to fill the entire landscape, becoming so diffuse in the process that one loses the ability to keep it fastened to the physical self.

Why? Because each of us is an egg, a unique soul enclosed in a fragile egg. Each of us is confronting a high wall. The high wall is the system which forces us to do the things we would not ordinarily see fit to do as individuals . . . We are all human beings, individuals, fragile eggs. We have no hope against the wall: it\'s too high, too dark, too cold. To fight the wall, we must join our souls together for warmth, strength. We must not let the system control us -- create who we are. It is we who created the system.

Oshima brings his two hands together tightly. \\"But today things are different. The darkness in the outside world has vanished, but the darkness in our hearts remains, virtually unchanged. Just like an iceberg, what we label the ego or consciousness is, for the most part, sunk in darkness. And that estrangement sometimes creates a deep contradiction or confusion within us.\u201d","I don\'t think most people would like my personality. There might be a few--very few, I would imagine--who are impressed by it, but only rarely would anyone like it. Who in the world could possibly have warm feelings, or something like them, for a person who doesn\'t compromise, who instead, whenever a problem crops up, locks himself away alone in a closet? But is it ever possible for a professional writer to be liked by people? I have no idea. Maybe somewhere in the world it is. It\'s hard to generalize. For me, at least, I\'ve written novels over many years, I just can\'t picture someone liking me on a personal level. Being disliked by someone, hated and despised, somehow seems more natural. Not that I\'m relieved when that happens. Even I\'m not happy when someone dislikes me.","\u0627\u0631\u0642\u0635.. \u064a\u062c\u0628 \u0623\u0646 \u062a\u0631\u0642\u0635.. \u0645\u0627\u062f\u0627\u0645\u062a \u0627\u0644\u0645\u0648\u0633\u064a\u0642\u0649 \u062a\u0639\u0632\u0641\u060c \u064a\u062c\u0628 \u0623\u0646 \u062a\u0631\u0642\u0635\u060c \u0644\u0627 \u062a\u0641\u0643\u0631 \u062d\u062a\u0649 \u0641\u064a \u0627\u0644\u0633\u0628\u0628\u060c \u0625\u0630\u0627 \u0634\u0631\u0639\u062a \u0641\u064a \u0627\u0644\u062a\u0641\u0643\u064a\u0631 \u0641\u0633\u0648\u0641 \u062a\u062a\u0648\u0642\u0641 \u0642\u062f\u0645\u0627\u0643. \u0625\u0630\u0627 \u062a\u0648\u0642\u0641\u062a \u0642\u062f\u0645\u0627\u0643 \u0641\u0633\u0648\u0641 \u0646\u062a\u0639\u0637\u0644 \u0646\u062d\u0646\u060c \u0641\u0633\u0648\u0641 \u062a\u062a\u0639\u0637\u0644 \u0623\u0646\u062a/ \u0644\u0630\u0627 \u0644\u0627 \u062a\u0641\u0643\u0631 \u0641\u064a \u0634\u064a\u0621 \u0645\u0647\u0645\u0627 \u0628\u062f\u0627 \u0630\u0644\u0643 \u062d\u0645\u0642\u0627\u060c \u064a\u062c\u0628 \u0623\u0646 \u062a\u0648\u0627\u0635\u0644 \u0627\u0644\u062e\u0637\u0649.. \u064a\u062c\u0628 \u0623\u0646 \u062a\u064f\u0645\u0631\u0651\u0646 \u062c\u0633\u0645\u0643\u060c \u064a\u062c\u0628 \u0623\u0646 \u062a\u062d\u0644\u062d\u0644 \u0645\u0627 \u0642\u0645\u062a \u0628\u0631\u0628\u0637\u0647\u060c \u064a\u062c\u0628 \u0623\u0646 \u062a\u0633\u062a\u062e\u062f\u0645 \u0643\u0644 \u0645\u0627 \u0644\u062f\u064a\u0643\u060c \u0646\u0639\u0644\u0645 \u0623\u0646\u0643 \u0645\u062a\u0639\u0628\u060c \u0645\u062a\u0639\u0628 \u0648\u062e\u0627\u0626\u0641\u060c \u0647\u0630\u0627 \u0645\u0627 \u064a\u062d\u062f\u062b \u0644\u0643\u0644 \u0634\u062e\u0635.. \u062d\u0633\u0646\u0627\u060c \u0641\u0642\u0637 \u0644\u0627 \u062a\u062f\u0639 \u0642\u062f\u0645\u064a\u0643 \u062a\u062a\u0648\u0642\u0641\u0627\u0646.","I\u2019m not good at talking, Naoko said. \u201cHaven\u2019t been for the longest while.

Lost opportunities, lost possibilities, feelings we can never get back again. That\'s what part of it means to be alive.

The tornado\u2019s intensity doesn\u2019t abate for a second as it blasts across the ocean, laying waste to Angkor Wat, incinerating an Indian jungle, tigers and everything, transforming itself into a Persian desert sandstorm, burying an exotic fortress city under a sea of sand.

In the deepening spring of May, I had no choice but to recognize the trembling of my heart. It usually happened as the sun was going down. In the pale evening gloom, when the soft fragrance of magnolias hung in the air, my heart would swell without warning, and tremble, and lurch with a stab of pain. I would try clamping my eyes shut and gritting my teeth, and wait for it to pass. And it would pass....but slowly, taking its own time, and leaving a dull ache behind.At those times I would write to Naoko. In my letters to her, I would describe only things that were touching or pleasant or beautiful: the fragrance of grasses, the caress of a spring breeze, the light of the moon, a movie I\'d seen, a song I liked, a book that had moved me. I myself would be comforted by letters like this when I would reread what I had written. And I would feel that the world I lived in was a wonderful one.

The boy was eighteen and the girl sixteen. He was not unusually handsome, and she was not especially beautiful. They were just an ordinary lonely boy and an ordinary lonely girl, like all the others. But they believed with their whole hearts that somewhere in the world there lived the 100% perfect boy and the 100% perfect girl for them. Yes, they believed in a miracle. And that miracle actually happened.One day the two came upon each other on the corner of a street.\u201cThis is amazing, he said. \u201cI\u2019ve been looking for you all my life. You may not believe this, but you\u2019re the 100% perfect girl for me.\u201d\u201cAnd you,\u201d she said to him, \u201care the 100% perfect boy for me, exactly as I\u2019d pictured you in every detail. It\u2019s like a dream.\u201dThey sat on a park bench, held hands, and told each other their stories hour after hour. They were not lonely anymore. They had found and been found by their 100% perfect other. What a wonderful thing it is to find and be found by your 100% perfect other. It\u2019s a miracle, a cosmic miracle.As they sat and talked, however, a tiny, tiny sliver of doubt took root in their hearts: Was it really all right for one\u2019s dreams to come true so easily?And so, when there came a momentary lull in their conversation, the boy said to the girl, \u201cLet\u2019s test ourselves - just once. If we really are each other\u2019s 100% perfect lovers, then sometime, somewhere, we will meet again without fail. And when that happens, and we know that we are the 100% perfect ones, we\u2019ll marry then and there. What do you think?\u201d\u201cYes,\u201d she said, \u201cthat is exactly what we should do.\u201dAnd so they parted, she to the east, and he to the west.The test they had agreed upon, however, was utterly unnecessary. They should never have undertaken it, because they really and truly were each other\u2019s 100% perfect lovers, and it was a miracle that they had ever met. But it was impossible for them to know this, young as they were. The cold, indifferent waves of fate proceeded to toss them unmercifully.One winter, both the boy and the girl came down with the season\u2019s terrible inluenza, and after drifting for weeks between life and death they lost all memory of their earlier years. When they awoke, their heads were as empty as the young D. H. Lawrence\u2019s piggy bank.They were two bright, determined young people, however, and through their unremitting efforts they were able to acquire once again the knowledge and feeling that qualified them to return as full-fledged members of society. Heaven be praised, they became truly upstanding citizens who knew how to transfer from one subway line to another, who were fully capable of sending a special-delivery letter at the post office. Indeed, they even experienced love again, sometimes as much as 75% or even 85% love.Time passed with shocking swiftness, and soon the boy was thirty-two, the girl thirty.One beautiful April morning, in search of a cup of coffee to start the day, the boy was walking from west to east, while the girl, intending to send a special-delivery letter, was walking from east to west, but along the same narrow street in the Harajuku neighborhood of Tokyo. They passed each other in the very center of the street. The faintest gleam of their lost memories glimmered for the briefest moment in their hearts. Each felt a rumbling in their chest. And they knew:She is the 100% perfect girl for me.He is the 100% perfect boy for me.But the glow of their memories was far too weak, and their thoughts no longer had the clarity of fouteen years earlier. Without a word, they passed each other, disappearing into the crowd. Forever.A sad story, don\u2019t you think?\u201d","Where there is light, there must be shadow, and where there is shadow there must be light. There is no shadow without light and no light without shadow. Karl Jung said this about \'the Shadow\' in one of his books: \'It is as evil as we are positive... the more desperately we try to be good and wonderful and perfect, the more the Shadow develops a definite will to be black and evil and destructive... The fact is that if one tries beyond one\'s capacity to be perfect, the shadow descends to hell and becomes the devil. For it is just as sinful from the standpoint of nature and of truth to be above oneself as to be below oneself.","At a certain point in our lives, when we really need a clear-cut solution, the person who knocks at our door is, more likely than not, a messenger bearing bad news. This isn\u2019t always the case, but from experience I\u2019d say the gloomy reports far outnumber the others. The messenger touches his hand to his cap and looks apologetic, but that does nothing to improve the contents of the message. It isn\u2019t the messenger\u2019s fault. No good to blame him, no good to grab him by the collar and shake him. The messenger is just conscientiously doing the job his boss assigned him. And this boss? That would be none other than our old friend Reality.","He once told me about polar bears - what solitary animals they are. They mate just once a year. One time in a whole year. There is no such thing as a lasting male-female bond in their world. One male polar bear and one female polar bear meet by sheer chance somewhere in the frozen vastness, and they mate. It doesn\'t take long. And once they are finished, the male runs away from the female as if he is frightened to death: he runs from the place where they have mated. He never looks back - literally. The rest of the year he lives in deep solitude. Mutual communications - the touching of two hearts - do not exist for them.

When you\'re supposed to go down, find the deepest well and go down to the bottom. When there is no flow, stay still. If you resist the flow, everything dries up.

They had never held anyone, never been held. They had not idea, either, where this action would take them. What they entered then was a doorless room.

I tried hard to forget, but there remained inside me a vague knot-of-air kind of thing. And as time went by, the knot began to take on a clear and simple form, a form that I am able to put into words, like this:Death exists, not as the opposite but as a part of life.Translate into words, it\'s a cliche, but at the time I felt it not as words but as that knot of air inside me. Death exists - in a paperweight, in four red and white balls on a billiard table - and we go on living and breathing it into our lungs like fine dust.Until that time, I had understood death as something entirely separate from and independent of life. The hand of death is bound to take us, I had felt, but until the day it reaches out for us, it leaves us alone. This had seemed to me the simple, logical truth. Life is here, death is over there. I am here, not over there.The night Kizuki died, however, I lost the ability to see death (and life) in such simple terms. Death was not the opposite of life. It was already here, within my being, it had always been here, and no struggle would permit me to forget that...I lived through the following spring...with that kind knot of air in my chest, but I struggled all the while against becoming serious. Becoming serious was not the same thing as approaching truth, I sensed, however vaguely. But death was a fact, a serious fact, no matter how you looked at it. stuck inside this suffocating contradiction, I went on endlessly spinning in circles...In the midst of life, everything revolved around death.","All things pass.

And sometimes this prophetic voice pushes a secret switch hidden deep inside your brain.Your heart is like a great river after a long spell of rain, spilling over its banks. All signposts that once stood on the ground are gone, inundated and carried away by that rush of water. And still the rain beats down on the surface of the river.

If something is important enough, a little mistake isn\'t going to ruin it all, or make it vanish. It might not be perfect, but the first step is actually building the station. Right? Otherwise trains won\'t stop there. And you can\'t meet the person who means so much to you. If you find some defect, you can adjust it later, as needed. First things first. Build the station. A special station just for her. The kind of station where trains want to stop, even if they have no reason to do so. Imagine that kind of station, and give it actual color and shape.

But if I do have time, I will come to understand you -- better than anyone else in the world ever can.","In the afternoon dark clouds suddenly color the sky a mysterious shade and it starts raining hard, pounding the roof and windows of the cabin. I strip naked and run outside, washing my face with soap and scrubbing myself all over. It feels wonderful. In my joy I shut my eyes and shout out meaningless words as the large raindrops strike me on the cheeks, the eyelids, chest, side, penis, legs, and butt - the stinging pain like a religious initiation or something. Along with the pain there\'s a feeling of closeness, like for once in my life the world\'s treating me fairly. I feel elated, as if all of a sudden I\'ve been set free. I face the sky, hands held wide apart, open my mouth wide, and gulp down the falling rain.","Naoko stayed frozen in place, like a small nocturnal animal that has been lured out by the moonlight. The direction of the glow exaggerated the silhouette of her lips. Seeming utterly fragile and vulnerable, the silhouette pulsed almost imperceptibly with the beating of her heart or the motions of her inner heart, as if she were whispering soundless words to the darkness. I swallowed in hopes of easing my thirst, but in the stillness of the night, the sound I made was huge. As if this were a signal to her, Naoko stood and glided toward the head of the bed, gown rustling faintly. She knelt on the floor by my pillow, eyes fixed on mine. I stared back at her, but her eyes told me nothing. Strangely transparent, they seemed like windows to a world beyond, but however long I peered into their depths, there was nothing I could see. Our faces were no more than ten inches apart, but she was light-years away from me.","It\'s all a question of imagination. Our responsibility begins with the power to imagine.

This is the same sort of tack I find necessary when writing a novel. I stop every day right at the point where I feel I can write more. Do that, and the next day\'s work goes surprisingly smoothly. I think Ernest Hemingway did something like that. To keep on going, you have to keep up the rhythm. This is the important thing for long-term projects. Once you set the pace, the rest will follow.

Within fashionable good, there\'s formal and then there\'s casual; there\'s hip, there\'s cool, there\'s trendy, there\'s snobbish. Mix \'n\' match.

You throw a rock and it\'ll come right back at you.","Nakata let his body relax, switched off his mind, allowing things to flow through him. This was natural for him, something he\'d done ever since he was a child, without a second thought. Before long the borders of his consciousness fluttered around, just like the butterflies. Beyond these borders lay a dark abyss. Occasionally his consciousness would fly over the border and hover over that dizzying black crevasse. But Nakata wasn\'t afraid of the darkness or how deep it was. And why should he be? That bottomless world of darkness, that weighty silence and chaos, was an old friend, a part of him already. Nakata understood this well. In that world there was no writing, no days of the week, no scary Governor, no opera, no BMWs. No scissors, no tall hats. On the other hand, there was also no delicious eel, no tasty bean-jam buns. Everything is there, but there are no parts. Since there are no parts, there\'s no need to replace one thing with another. No need to remove anything, or add anything. You don\'t have to think about difficult things, just let yourself soak it all in. For Nakata, nothing could be better.","I go out on the porch and gaze up at the stars twinkling above, the random scattering of millions of stars. Even in a planetarium you wouldn\'t find as many. Some of them really look big and distinct, like if you reached your hand out intently you could touch them. The whole thing is breathtaking. Not just beautiful though--the stars like the trees in the forest, alive and breathing. And they\'re watching me. What I\'ve done up till now, what I\'m going to do--they know it all. Nothing gets past their watchful eyes. As I sit there under the shining night sky, again a violent fear takes hold of me. My heart\'s pounding a mile a minute, and I can barely breathe. All these millions of stars looking down on me, and I\'ve never given them more than a passing thought before. Bot just stars--how many other things haven\'t I noticed in the world, things I know nothing about? I suddenly feel helpless, completely powerless. And I know I\'ll never outrun that awful feeling. (135)","I always say\u2014a prejudice on my part, I\'m sure\u2014you can tell a lot about a person\'s character from his choice of sofa. Sofas constitute a realm inviolate unto themselves.This, however, is something that only those who have grown up sitting on good sofas will appreciate. It\'s like growing up reading good books or listening to good music. One good sofa breeds another good sofa; one bad sofa breeds another bad sofa. That\'s how it goes.There are people who drive luxury cars, but have only second- or third-rate sofas in their homes. I put little trust in such people. An expensive automobile may well be worth its price, but it\'s only an expensive automobile. If you have the money, you can buy it, anyone can buy it. Procuring a good sofa, on the other hand, requires style and experience and philosophy. It takes money, yes, but you also need a vision of the superior sofa. That sofa among sofas.","I don\'t give a damn about what people say. They can be reptile food for all I care.","If you lose your ego, you lose the thread of that narrative you call your Self. Humans, however, can\'t live very long without some sense of a continuing story. Such stories go beyond the limited rational system (or the systematic rationality) with which you surround yourself; they are crucial keys to sharing time-experience with others. Now a narrative is a story, not a logic, nor ethics, nor philosophy. It is a dream you keep having, whether you realize it or not. Just as surely as you breathe, you go on ceaselessly dreaming your story. And in these stories you wear two faces. You are simultaneously subject and object. You are a whole and you are a part. You are real and you are shadow. \\"Storyteller\\" and at the same time \\"character\\". It is through such multilayering of roles in our stories that we heal the loneliness of being an isolated individual in the world. Yet without a proper ego nobody can create a personal narrative, any more than you can drive a car without an engine, or cast a shadow without a real physical object. But once you\'ve consigned your ego to someone else, where on earth do you go from there?At this point you receive a new narrative from the person to whom you have entrusted your ego. You\'ve handed over the real thing, so what comes back is a shadow. And once your ego has merged with another ego, your narrative will necessarily take on the narrative created by that ego.Just what kind of narrative?It needn\'t be anything particularly fancy, nothing complicated or refined. You don\'t need to have literary ambitions. In fact, the sketchier and simpler the better. Junk, a leftover rehash will do. Anyway, most people are tired of complex, multilayered scenarios-they are a potential letdown. It\'s precisely because people can\'t find any fixed point within their own multilayered schemes that they\'re tossing aside their own self-identity.","Once I began a book, I couldn\u2019t put it down. It was like an addiction; I read while I ate, on the train, in bed until late at night, in school, where I\u2019d keep the book hidden so I could read during class. But I had almost no desire to talk with anyone about the experience I gained through books and music.

It usually happened as the sun was going down. In the pale evening gloom, when the soft fragrance of magnolias hung in the air, my heart would swell without warning, and tremble, and lurch with a stab of pain.

Her small gold earrings caught the light as the taxi swayed. Her midnight blue dress seemed to have been made to match the darkness of the cab. Every now and then her thinly daubed, beautifully formed lips would quiver slightly as if she had caught herself on the verge of talking to herself. Watching her, I could see why Nagasawa had chosen her as his special companion. There were any number of women more beautiful than Hatsumi, and Nagasawa could have made any of them his. But Hatsumi had some quality that could send a tremor through your heart. It was nothing forceful. The power she exerted was a subtle thing, but it called forth deep resonances. I watched her all the way to Shibuya, and wondered, without ever finding an answer, what this emotional reverberation that I was feeling could be.It finally hit me some dozen or so years later. I had come to Santa Fe to interview a painter and was sitting in a local pizza parlor, drinking beer and eating pizza and watching a miraculously beautiful sunset. Everything was soaked in brilliant red\u2014my hand, the plate, the table, the world\u2014as if some special kind of fruit juice had splashed down on everything. In the midst of this overwhelming sunset, the image of Hatsumi flashed into my mind, and in that moment I understood what that tremor of the heart had been. It was a kind of childhood longing that had always remained\u2014and would forever remain\u2014unfulfilled. I had forgotten the existence of such innocent, all-but-seared-in longing: forgotten for years to remember what such feelings had ever existed inside of me. What Hatsumi had stirred in me was a part of my very self that had long lain dormant. And when the realization struck me, it aroused such sorrow I almost burst into tears. She had been an absolutely special woman. Someone should have done something\u2014anything\u2014to save her.But neither Nagasawa nor I could have managed that. As so many of those I knew had done, Hatsumi reached a certain stage in her life and decided\u2014almost on the spur of the moment\u2014to end it. Two years after Nagasawa left for Germany, she married, and two years after that she slashed her wrists with a razor blade.It was Nagasawa, of course, who told me what had happened. His letter from Bonn said this: \u201cHatsumi\u2019s death has extinguished something. This is unbearably sad and painful, even to me. I ripped his letter to shreds and threw it away. I never wrote to him again.\u201d","You\'re you, you see, and nobody else. You are you, right?","It may well be that we can never fully adapt to our own deformities.

Only people who pretend to be strong.","Shimamoto was in charge of the records. She\'d take one from its jacket, place it carefully on the turntable without touching the grooves with her fingers, and, after making sure to brush the cartridge free of any dust with a tiny brush, lower the needle ever so gently onto the record. When the record was finished, she\'d spray it and wipe it with a felt cloth. Finally she\'d return the record to its jacket and its proper place on the shelf. Her father had taught her this procedure, and she followed his instructions with a terribly serious look on her face, her eyes narrowed, her breath held in check. Meanwhile, I was on the sofa, watching her every move. Only when the record was safely back on the shelf did she turn to me and give a little smile. And every time, this thought hit me: It wasn\'t a record she was handling. It was a fragile soul inside a glass bottle.","When I thought of how I\u2019d been living, how I\u2019d been approaching life, it was all so trite, so miserably pointless. Unimaginative middle-class rubbish, and I wanted to gather it all up and stuff it away in some drawer. Or else light it on fire and watch it go up in smoke (though what kind of smoke it would emit I had no idea).","Nah, I shook my head, things that come out of nowhere go back to nowhere, that\u2019s all.We fell silent again. The thing we had shared was nothing more than a fragment of time that had died long ago. Even so, a faint glimmer of that warm memory still claimed a part of my heart. And when death claimed me, no doubt I would walk along by that faint light in the brief instant before being flung once again into the abyss of nothingness.","I\'ve finally experienced what the poet felt. The deep sense of loss after you\'ve met the woman you love, have made love, then said goodbye. Like you\'re suffocating. The same emotion hasn\'t changed at all in a thousand years.","Had I done the right thing by not telling her? Maybe not. Who on earth wanted the right thing anyway? Yet what meaning could there be if nothing was right? If nothing was fair? Fairness is a concept that holds only in limited situations. Yet we want the concept to extend to everything, in and out of phase.","Listen, every object\'s in flux. The Earth, time, concepts, love, life, faith, justice, evil--they\'re all fluid and in transition. They don\'t stay in one form or in one place forever. The whole universe is like some big FedEx box.","What do you mean, \'playing really creatively\'? Can you give me an example?\\"\\"Hmm, let\'s see ... you send the music deep enough into your heart so that it makes your body undergo a kind of a physical shift, and simultaneously the listener\'s body also undergoes the same kind of physical shift. It\'s giving birth to that kind of shared state. Probably.","We all live our lives carrying secrets we cannot disclose.","Jean-Jacques Rousseau defined civilization as when people build fences. A very perceptive observation. And it\u2019s true\u2014all civilization is the product of a fenced-in lack of freedom. The Australian Aborigines are the exception, though. They managed to maintain a fenceless civilization until the seventeenth century. They\u2019re dyed-in-the-wool free. They go where they want, when they want, doing what they want. Their lives are a literal journey. Walkabout is a perfect metaphor for their lives. When the English came and built fences to pen in their cattle, the Aborigines couldn\u2019t fathom it. And, ignorant to the end of the principle at work, they were classified as dangerous and antisocial and were driven away, to the outback. So I want you to be careful. The people who build high, strong fences are the ones who survive the best. You deny that reality only at the risk of being driven into the wilderness yourself.","But it\'s strange, isn\'t it?\\" Eri said.\\"What is?\\"\\"That amazing time in our lives is gone, and will never return. All the beautiful possibilities we had then have been swallowed up in the flow of time.","La muerte no existe en contraposici\xf3n a la vida sino como parte de ella.","Listen--God only exists in people\'s minds. Especially in Japan, God\'s always been kind of a flexible concept. Look at what happened after the war. Douglas MacArthur ordered the divine emperor to quit being God, and he did, making a speech saying he was just an ordinary person. So after 1946 he wasn\'t God anymore. That\'s what Japanese gods are like--they can be tweaked and adjusted. Some American comping on a cheap pipe gives the order and presto change-o--God\'s no longer God. A very postmodern kind of thing. If you think God\'s there, He is. If you don\'t, He isn\'t.~pages 286-287","When you\u2019re surrounded by endless possibilities, one of the hardest things you can do is pass them up.","Of course, they\'re not clowning around trying to make me laugh.

But then God took a knife and cut everybody in half, right down the middle. So after that the world was divided just into male and female, the upshot being that people spend their time running around trying to locate their missing other half.","Person A understand Person B because the time is right for that to happen, not because Person B wants to be understood by Person A.","I\u2019m struck by how, except when you\u2019re young, you really need to prioritize in life, figuring out in what order you should divide up your time and energy.

We are all human beings, individuals transcending nationality and race and religion, fragile eggs faced with a solid wall called The System. To all appearances, we have no hope of winning. The wall is too high, too strong - and too cold. If we have any hope of victory at all, it will have to come from our believing in the utter uniqueness and irreplaceability of our own and others\' souls and from the warmth we gain by joining souls together.Take a moment to think about this. Each of us possesses a tangible, living soul. The System has no such thing. We must not allow The System to exploit us. We must not allow The System to take on a life of its own. The System did not make us: We made The System.","No matter how empty it may be, this is still my heart.","I mean, the ones on trial are not like me in any way: they\'re a different kind of human being.

At least, that\'s how I saw it at first. ...I became a lot less sure of myself. In other words, I started seeing it like this: that there really was no such thing as a wall separating their world from mine. Or if there was such a wall, it was probably a flimsy one made of papier-mache. The second I leaned on it, I\'d probably fall right through and end up on the other side. Or maybe it\'s that the other side has already managed to sneak its way inside of us, and we just haven\'t noticed.","But maybe that\u2019s the way it should be.

In other words, I put a freeze on my emotions. Later, when I thaw them out to perform the examination, I do occasionally find my emotions in a distressed state, but that is rare.

After much deep thought, he reached a conclusion. No matter how clear the relationships of things might become in the forest of story, there was never a clear-cut solution. That was how it differed from math. The role of a story was, in the broadest terms, to transpose a single problem into another form. Depending on the nature and direction of the problem, a solution could be suggested in the narrative. Tengo would return to the real world with that suggestion in hand.

You could try watering it all you wanted, but everything would be sucked down to the bottom of the world, leaving no trace of moisture. No life could take route there. Not even birds would fly over it. What had created such a wasteland inside Ayumi, only she herself knew. No, maybe not even Ayumi knew the true cause. But one of the biggest factors had to be twisted sexual desires that men around Ayumi had forced upon her.As if to build a fence around the fatal emptiness inside her, she had to create the sunny personality that she became.But if you peeled away the ornamental egos that she had built, there was only an abyss of nothingness and the intense thirst that came with it.Though she tried to forget it, the nothingness would visit her periodically on a lonely rainy afternoon, or at dawn when she woke from a nightmare.What she needed at such times was to be held by someone, anyone.","I\'m struck by how pitiful and pointless this little container called me is, what a lame, shabby being I am.

Everyone is always a work in progress.","As usual, Junko thought about Jack London\'s \'To Build a Fire.\' It was the story of a man traveling alone through the snowy Alaskan interior and his attempts to light a fire. He would freeze to death unless he could make it catch. The sun was going down. Junko hadn\'t read much fiction, but that one short story she had read again and again, ever since her teacher had assigned it as an essay topic during summer vacation of her first year in high school. The scene of the story would always come vividly to mind as she read. She could feel the man\'s fear and hope and despair as if they were her own; she could sense the very pounding of his heart as he hovered on the brink of death. Most important of all, though, was the fact that the man was fundamentally longing for death. She knew that for sure. She couldn\'t explain how she knew, but she knew it from the start. Death was really what he wanted. He knew that it was the right ending for him. And yet he had to go on fighting with all his might. He had to fight against an overwhelming adversary in order to survive. What most shook Junko was this deep-rooted contradiction.The teacher ridiculed her view. \'Death is really what he wanted? That\'s a new one for me! And strange! Quite \'original,\' I\'d have to say.\' He read her conclusion aloud before the class, and everybody laughed.But Junko knew. All of them were wrong. Otherwise how could the ending of the story be so quiet and beautiful?","She didn\'t answer. Instead, she smiled sweetly.

No clue what I should do every day, no vision for the future. For the most part, I remained hidden away, deep within myself. Sometimes, I\'d go a week without talking to anybody.","I might think I can\'t take it any more, that I can\'t go on any more, but one way or another I get past that.","It might be a little silly for someone getting to be my age to put this into words, but I just want to make sure I get the facts down clearly : I\'m the kind of person who likes to be by himself.

That\'s what I\'d like you to realize. I\'m just a regular person, not some monster. I feel the same things everyone else does, act the same way. Sometimes, though, that small difference feels like an abyss. But I guess there\'s not much I can do about it.","There are times when the understanding does not come until later, when it no longer matters. Other times I do what I must do, not knowing my own mind, and I am led astray.","Most of the troubles in life come on all of a sudden.","The Earth slowly keeps on turning.

Lost opportunities, lost possibilities, feelings we can never get back again. That\'s part of what it means to be alive. But inside our heads--at least that\'s where I imagine it--there\'s a little room where we store those memories. A room like the stacks in this library. And to understand the workings of our own heart we have to keep on making new reference cards. We have to dust things off every once in a while, let in fresh air, change the water in the flower vases. In other words, you\'ll live forever in your own private library.","Creative people have to be fundamentally egoistic. This may sound pompous, but it happens to be the truth. People who live their lives watching what goes on around them, trying not to make waves, and looking for the easy compromise are not going to be able to do creative work, whatever their field. To build something where there was nothing requires deep individual concentration, and in most cases that kind of concentration occurs in a place unrelated to cooperation with others, a place we might even call d\xe4monisch.","It seemed unreasonable, unfair, that a woman so young and beautiful should be so exhausted. Of course, it was neither unreasonable nor unfair. Exhaustion pays no mind to age and beauty.

Curiosity can bring guts out of hiding at times, maybe even get them going. But curiosity usually evaporates. Guts have to go for the long haul. Curiosity\u2019s like a fun friend you can\u2019t really trust. It turns you on and then it leaves you to make it on your own-with whatever guts you can muster.","But what disgusts me even more are people who have no imagination. The kind T. S. Eliot calls hollow men. People who fill up that lack of imagination with heartless bits of straw, not even aware of what they\u2019re doing. Callous people who throw a lot of empty words at you, trying to force you to do what you don\u2019t want to. Gays, lesbians, straights, feminists, fascist pigs, communists, Hare Krishnas \u2013 none of them bother me. I don\u2019t care what banner they raise. But what I can\u2019t stand are hollow people. [...]Narrow minds devoid of imagination. Intolerance, theories cut off from reality, empty terminology, usurped ideals, inflexible systems. Those are the things that really frighten me. What I absolutely fear and loathe. Of course it\'s important to know what\u2019s right and what\u2019s wrong. Individual errors in judgment can usually be corrected. As long as you have the courage to admit mistakes, things can be turned around. But intolerant, narrow minds with no imagination are like parasites that transform the host, change form, and continue to thrive.","Reality was one step out of line, a cardigan with the buttons done up wrong.","There are some things in this world that can be done over, and some that can\u2019t. And time passing is one thing that can\u2019t be redone. Come this far, and you can\u2019t go back.","Sumire was a hopeless romantic, a bit set in her ways - innocent of the ways of the world, to put a nice spin on it. Start her talking and she\'d go on nonstop, but if she was with someone she didn\'t get along with - most people in the world, in other words - she barely opened her mouth. She smoked too much, and you could count on her to lose her ticket every time she took the train. She\'d get so engrossed in her thoughts at times she\'d forget to eat, and she was as thin as one of those war orphans in an old Italian film - like a stick with eyes. I\'d love to show you a photo of her but I don\'t have any. She hated having her photograph taken - no desire to leave behind for posterity a Portrait of the Artist as a Young (Wo)Man.","Everything is blowing up around us, but there are still those who care about a broken lock, and others who are dutiful enough to try to fix it \u2026 But maybe that\u2019s the way it should be. Maybe working on the little things as dutifully and honestly as we can is how we stay sane when the world is falling apart.","Everything is there but there are no parts. Since there are no parts there\'s no need to replace one thing with another. No need to remove anything or add anything. You don\'t have to think about difficult things just let yourself soak it all in. For Nakata nothing could be better.","The things we try our hardest not to lose, we really just put deep abysses in the spaces between them.","My life is like a trunk stuffed with dirty laundry. It contains more than enough material to drive any one human being to mental aberration - maybe two or three people\'s worth? My sex life alone would do. It\u2019s nothing I could talk about to anyone. No, I can\u2019t go to a doctor. I have to solve this on my own.","To understand something and to put that something into a form that you can see with your own eyes are two completely different things. If you could manage to do both equally well, living would be a lot simpler (from Honey Pie)","The total amount of time available is especially limited. The clock is ticking as we speak. Time rushes past. Opportunities are lost right and left. If you have money, you can buy time. You can even buy freedom if you want. Time and freedom: those are the most important things that people can buy with money.","I have a thing about losers. Flaws in oneself open you up to others with flaws.","solitude is, more or less, an inevitable circumstance. Sometimes, however, this sense of isolation, like acid spilling out of a bottle, can unconsciously eat away at a person\u2019s heart and dissolve it. You could see it, too, as a kind of double-edged sword. It protects me, but at the same time steadily cuts away at me from the inside. I think in my own way I\u2019m aware of this danger\u2014probably through experience\u2014and that\u2019s why I\u2019ve had to constantly keep my body in motion, in some cases pushing myself to the limit, in order to heal the loneliness I feel inside and to put it in perspective. Not so much as an intentional act, but as an instinctive reaction.","Tsukuru remembered those days in college when all he\u2019d thought about was dying. Already sixteen years ago. Back then he was convinced that if he merely focused on what was going on inside of him, his heart would finally stop of its own accord. That if he intensely concentrated his feelings on one fixed point, like a lens focused on paper, bursting it into flames, his heart would suffer a fatal blow. More than anything he hoped for this. But months passed, and contrary to his expectation, his heart didn\u2019t stop. The heart apparently doesn\u2019t stop that easily.","It\'s all a question of imagination. Our responsibility begins with the power to imagine.","It seems as if, year after year, the world becomes a more difficult place to live.","Quando la tempesta sar\xe0 finita, probabilmente non saprai neanche tu come hai fatto ad attraversarla e a uscirne vivo. Anzi, non sarai neanche sicuro se sia finita per davvero. Ma su un punto non c\'\xe8 dubbio... Ed \xe8 che tu, uscito da quel vento, non sarai lo stesso che vi \xe8 entrato.","It\u2019s a waste of time to think about things you can\u2019t know, and things you can\u2019t confirm even if you know them.","Dok god muzika svira, igraj dok te noge nose. Razumes li sta ti govorim? Igraj dok te noge nose. Ne smes da razmisljas zasto igras. Ne smes da razmisljas o znacenju toga. Jer, u osnovi, znacenja nema.

A miscellany of trivia with no home to call their own. Lingering for two or three days, that something soon disappears, returning to the darkness. There are wells, deep wells, dug in our hearts. Birds fly over them.\\"-from \\"Pinball, 1973","When he woke up the next day, the world was still there, and things were already moving forward, like the great karmic wheel of Indian mythology that kills every living thing in its path.","It wasn\'t like there was some obvious change. Actually, the problem was more a lack of change. Nothing about her had changed - the way she spoke, her clothes, the topics she chose to talk about, her opinions - they were all the same as before. Their relationship was like a pendulum gradually grinding to a halt, and he felt out of synch.","In any case, though, I believe that I have no been fair to you and that, as a result, I must have led you around in circles and hurt you deeply. In doing so, however, I have led myself around in circles and hurt myself just as deeply. I say this not as an excuse or means of self-justification but because it\'s true. If I have left a wound inside you, it is not just your wound, but mine as well. So please try not to hate me. I am a flawed human being - a far more flawed human being than you realize. Which is precisely why I do not want you to hate me. Because if you were to do that I would really go to pieces. I can\'t do what you can do: I can\'t slip inside my shell and wait for things to pass. I don\'t know for a fact that you are really like that, but sometimes you give me that impression. I often envy that in you, which may be why I led you around in circles so much.","Slowly like a movie fade out, the real world evaporates. I\'m alone, inside the world of the story.

A myth. An old one. I read it when I was a kid, so I probably don\u2019t have the story exactly right, but it goes something like this. Three brothers went out fishing and got caught in a storm. They drifted on the ocean for a long time until they washed up on the shore of an uninhabited island. It was a beautiful island with coconuts growing there and tons of fruit on the trees, and a big, high mountain in the middle. The night they got there, a god appeared in their dreams and said, \u2018A little farther down the shore, you will find three big, round boulders. I want each of you to push his boulder as far as he likes. The place you stop pushing your boulder is where you will live. The higher you go, the more of the world you will be able to see from your home. It\u2019s entirely up to you how far you want to push your boulder.\u2019 The young man takes a drink of water and pauses for a moment. Mari looks bored, but she is clearly listening. \u201cOkay so far?\u201d he asks. Mari nods. \u201cWant to hear the rest? If you\u2019re not interested, I can stop.\u201d \u201cIf it\u2019s not too long.\u201d \u201cNo, it\u2019s not too long. It\u2019s a pretty simple story.\u201d He takes another sip of water and continues with his story. \u201cSo the three brothers found three boulders on the shore just as the god had said they would. And they started pushing them along as the god told them to. Now these were huge, heavy boulders, so rolling them was hard, and pushing them up an incline took an enormous effort. The youngest brother quit first. He said, \u2018Brothers, this place is good enough for me. It\u2019s close to the shore, and I can catch fish. It has everything I need to go on living. I don\u2019t mind if I can\u2019t see that much of the world from here.\u2019 His two elder brothers pressed on, but when they were midway up the mountain, the second brother quit. He said, \u2018Brother, this place is good enough for me. There is plenty of fruit here. It has everything I need to go on living. I don\u2019t mind if I can\u2019t see that much of the world from here.\u2019 The eldest brother continued walking up the mountain. The trail grew increasingly narrow and steep, but he did not quit. He had great powers of perseverance, and he wanted to see as much of the world as he possibly could, so he kept rolling the boulder with all his might. He went on for months, hardly eating or drinking, until he had rolled the boulder to the very peak of the high mountain. There he stopped and surveyed the world. Now he could see more of the world than anyone. This was the place he would live\u2014where no grass grew, where no birds flew. For water, he could only lick the ice and frost. For food, he could only gnaw on moss. Be he had no regrets, because now he could look out over the whole world. And so, even today, his great, round boulder is perched on the peak of that mountain on an island in Hawaii. That\u2019s how the story goes.\u201d","You are not lost. It\'s just that your own thoughts are being kept from you, or hidden away. But the mind is strong. It survives, even without thought. Even with everything taken away, it holds a seed--your self. You must believe in your own powers.","Even if things were the same, people\'s perception of them might have been very different back then. The darkness of night was probably deeper then, so the moon must have been that much bigger and brighter.","It\'s not so easy for people to end their own lives. It\'s not like in the movies. There, they do it like nothing, no pain, and it\'s all over, they\'re dead. The reality is not like that.

The first thing you have to do is believe that. That\'s your starting point.\'\'But she abandoned me. She disappeared, leaving me alone where I shouldn\'t be. I\'m finally beginning to understand how much that hurt. How could she do it if she really loved me?\'\'That\'s the reality of it. It did happen,\'the boy named Crow says. \'You were hurt badly, and those scars will be with you forever. I feel sorry for you, I really do. But think of it like this: It\'s not too late to recover. You\'re young, you\'re tough. You\'re adaptable. You can patch up your wounds, lift your head, and move on. But for her that\'s not an option. The only thing she\'ll ever be is lost. It doesn\'t matter whether somebody judges this as good or bad- that\'s not the point.  You\'re  the one who has the advantage. You ought to consider that.\'I don\'t respond. \'It all really happened, you can\'t undo it,\' Crow tells me. \'She shouldn\'t have abandoned you then, and you shouldn\'t have  been  abandoned. But things in the past are like a plate that\'s shattered to pieces. You can never put it back together like it was, right?\'I nod.  You can never put it back together like it was.  He\'s hit the nail on the head. The boy named Crow continues. \'Your mother felt a gut-wrenching kind of fear and anger inside her, okay? Just like you do now. Which is why she had to abandon you.\'\'Even though she loved me?\'\'Even though she loved you, she had to abandon you. You need to understand how she felt then, and learn to accept it. Understand the overpowering fear and anger she experienced, and feel it as your own- so you won\'t inherit it and repeat it. The main thing is this: You have to  forgive  her. That\'s not going to be easy, I know, but you have to do it. That\'s the only way you can be saved. There\'s no other way!\'- pg 398-99","They dig holes from time to time,\' the Colonel explains. \'It is probably for them what chess is for me. It has no special meaning, does not transport them anywhere. All of us dig at our own pure holes. We have nothing to achieve by our activities, nowhere to get to. Is there not something marvelous about this? We hurt no one and no one gets hurt. No victory, no defeat.","I am endowed with the capacity to believe. I believe in all honesty that something will appear to guide me through the darkest and narrowest tunnel, or across the most desolate plain.","Somewhere between \'not enough\' and \'not at all.\' I was always hungry for love.

Never, not once.","With Naoko gone, I went to sleep on the sofa. I hadn\'t intended to do so, but I fell into the kind of deep sleep I had not in a long time, filled with a sense of Naoko\'s presence. In the kitchen were the dishes Naoko ate from, in the bathroom was the toothbrush Naoko used, and in the bedroom was the bed in which Naoko slept.

I give it some thirty-six good twists by the time I\'ve gotten up, brushed my teeth, shaved, eaten breakfast, changed my clothes, left the dorm, and arrived at the university. I tell myself, Ok, let\'s make this day another good one.","Sometimes fate is like a small sandstorm that keeps changing directions. You change direction but the sandstorm chases you. You turn again, but the storm adjusts. Over and over you play this out, like some ominous dance with death just before dawn. Why? Because this storm isn\'t some\xad thing that blew in from far away, something that has nothing to do with you. This storm is you. Something inside of you.","It was the usual noontime university scene, but as I sat watching it with renewed attention, I became aware of a certain fact. In his or her own way, each person I saw before me looked happy. Whether they really were happy or just looked it, I couldn\'t tell. But they did look happy on this pleasant early afternoon at the end of September, and because of that I felt a kind of loneliness that was new to me, as if I were the only one here who was not truly part of the scene.","We truly believed in something back then, and we knew we were the kind of people capable of believing in something\u2014with all our hearts. And that kind of hope will never simply vanish.","I was at that age, that time of life when every sight, every feeling, every thought came back, like a boomerang, to me. And worse, I was in love. Love with complications. Scenery was the last thing on my mind.","All of us are laboring under the same conditions. It\u2019s like we\u2019re all flying in the same busted airplane. Sure, some of us are luckier than others. Some are tough and some are weak. Some are rich and some poor. But no one\u2019s superman\u2014in that way, we\u2019re all weak. If we own things, we\u2019re terrified we\u2019ll lose them; if we\u2019ve got nothing we worry it\u2019ll be that way forever. We\u2019re all the same. If you catch on to that early enough, you can try to make yourself stronger, even if only a little. It\u2019s okay to fake it. Right? There are no truly strong people.

Don\'t feel sorry for yourself, only arseholes do that.","Nothingness means there\'s absolutely nothing, so maybe there\'s no need to understand it or imagine it.","I just run. I run in a void. Or maybe I should put it the other way: I run in order to acquire a void. But as you might expect, an occasional thought will slip into this void. People\u2019s minds can\u2019t be a complete blank. Human beings\u2019 emotions are not strong or consistent enough to sustain a vacuum. What I mean is, the kinds of thoughts and ideas that invade my emotions as I run remain subordinate to that void. Lacking content, they are just random thoughts that gather around that central void. The thoughts that occur to me while I\u2019m running are like clouds in the sky. Clouds of all different sizes. They come and they go, while the sky remains the same sky as always. The clouds are mere guests in the sky that pass away and vanish, leaving behind the sky.","Narrow minds devoid ofimagination.

Of course it\'s important to know what\'s right and what\'s wrong.Individual errors in judgment can usually be corrected. As long as you have the courageto admit mistakes, things can be turned around. But intolerant, narrow minds with noimagination are like parasites that transform the host, change form, and continue tothrive. They\'re a lost cause","I think of human existence as being like a two-story house. On the first floor people gather together to take their meals, watch television, and talk. The second floor contains private chambers, bedrooms where people go to read books, listen to music by themselves, and so on. Then there is a basement;this is a special place, and there are a number of things stored here. We don\u2019t use this room much in our daily life, but sometimes we come in, vaguely hang around the place. Then, my thought is that underneath that basement room is yet another basement room. This one has a very special door, very difficult to figure out, and normally you can\u2019t get in there\u2014some people never get in at all. . . . You go in, wander about in the darkness, and experience things there you wouldn\u2019t see in the normal parts of the house. You connect with your past there, because you have entered into your own soul. But then you come back. If you stay over there for long you can never get back to reality.","No te compadezcas de ti mismo. Eso s\xf3lo lo hacen los mediocres.-Nagasawa","I\u2019m safe inside this container called me.

What people need is beautiful, comforting stories that make them feel as if their lives have some meaning. Which is where religion comes from.\\" (...)\\"If a certain belief--call it \'Belief A\'--makes the life of that man or this woman appear to be something of deep meaning, then for them belief A is the truth. If Belief B makes their lives appear to be powerless & puny, then Belief b turns out to be a falsehood. The distinction is quite clear. If someone insists that Belief B is the truth, people will probably hate him ignore him, or, in some cases, attack him. It means nothing to them that Belief B might be logical or provable.","Am I happy? All I can say is I guess so. That\'s pretty much the way it is with dreams.","Lady, did you ever see anyone shot by a gunwithout bleeding? This film came out at the height of the VietnamWar.I love that line.

He was both a spirit of amazing loftiness and an irredeemable man of the gutter. He could charge forward, the optimistic leader, even as his heart writhed in a swamp of loneliness. He lived in his own special hell.","Or maybe that\u2019s what it\u2019s all about: this religion\u2019s substance is its lack of substance. In McLuhanesque terms, the medium is the message.

Only Sumire could do that for me.","In this world, there is no absolute good, no absolute evil,\\" the man said. \\"Good and evil are not fixed, stable entities but are continually trading places. A good may be transformed into an evil in the next second. And vice versa. Such was the way of the world that Dostoevksy depicted in The Brothers Karamazov. The most important thing is to maintain the balance between the constantly moving good and evil. If you lean too much in either direction, it becomes difficult to maintain actual morals. Indeed, balance itself is the good.","For a certain kind of person, love begins from something tiny and silly. From something like that or it doesn\'t begin at all.","But what I want to convey to you, Mr Okada, is this: I happened to lose my life at one particular moment in time, and I have gone on living these forty years or more with my life lost. As a person who finds himself in such a position, I have come to think that life is a far more limited thing than those in the midst of its maelstrom realize. The light shines into the act of life for only the briefest moment \u2013 perhaps only a matter of seconds. Once it is gone and one has failed to grasp its offered revelation, there is no second chance. One may have to live the rest of one\u2019s life in hopeless depths of loneliness and remorse.

It\'s in my nature as a novelist. Novelists can\'t trust anything they haven\'t seen with their own eyes or touched with their own hands. (Jerusalem Prize acceptance speech, JERUSALEM POST, Feb. 15, 2009)","I\u2019m the kind of person who has to experience something physically, actually touch something, before I have a clear sense of it. No matter what it is, unless I see it with my own eyes I\u2019m not convinced. I\u2019m a physical, not intellectual, type of person. Of course I have a certain amount of intelligence\u2014at least I think I do. If I totally lacked that there\u2019d be no way I could write novels.

Sit tight and wait for the right moment. Not try to change anything by force, just watch the drift of things. Make an effort to cast a fair eye on everything.

Do you see what I\'m getting at? It would be such a waste. The years nineteen and twenty are a crucial stage in the maturation of character, and if you allow yourself to become warped when you\'re that age, it will cause you pain when you\'re older. It\'s true. So think carefully. If you want to take care of Naoko, take care of yourself too.\\" I said I would think about it.","That\'s what love\'s all about, Kafka. You\'re the one having those wonderful feelings, but you have to go it alone as you wander through the dark. Your mind and body have to bear it all. All by yourself.","I\u2019m completely empty. Do you know what it means to be completely empty? Being empty is like an unlived-in house. An unlocked unlived-in house. Anybody can come in, any time they want.

It just sort of goes where it feels like going.","Probably we\u2019d have been better off born in nineteenth-century Russia. I\u2019d have been Prince So-and-so and you Count Such-and-such. We\u2019d go hunting together, fight, be rivals in love, have our metaphysical complaints, drink beer watching the sunset from the shores of the Black Sea. In our later years, the two of us would be implicated in the Something-or-other Rebellion and exiled to Siberia, where we\u2019d die. Brilliant, don\u2019t you think? Me, if I\u2019d been born in the nineteenth century, I\u2019m sure I could have written better novels. Maybe not your Dostoyevsky, but a known second-rate novelist. And what would you have been doing? Maybe you\u2019d only have been Count Such-and-such straight through. That wouldn\u2019t be so bad, just being Count Such-and-such. That\u2019d be nice and nineteenth century.","Once you\'ve hidden something, you have to keep it hidden.","Because you are neither an angel nor a god. I am quite aware that your actions have been prompted by your pure feelings, and I understand perfectly well that, for that very reason, you do not wish to receive money for what you have done. But pure unadultered feelings are dangerous in their own way. It is no easy feat for a flesh-and-blood human being to go on living with such feelings. That is why it is necessary for you to fasten your feelings to the earth \u2013 firmly, like attaching an anchor to a balloon. The money is for that.

Well before Freud and Jung shined a light on the workings of the subconscious, this correlation between darkness and our subconscious, these two forms of darkness, was obvious to people. It wasn\u2019t a metaphor, even. If you trace it back further, it wasn\u2019t even a correlation. Until Edison invented the electric light, most of the world was totally covered in darkness. The physical darkness outside and the inner darkness of the soul were mixed together, with no boundary separating the two. They were directly linked. Like this. Oshima brings his two hands together tightly.\u201d","The scent of the sea and the burning asphalt being carried on the southerly wind made me think of summers past. The warmth of a girl\'s skin, old rock n\' roll, button-down shirts right out of the wash, the smell of cigarettes smoked in the pool locker room, faint premonitions, everyone\'s sweet, limitless summer dreams. And then one year(when was it?), those dreams didn\'t come back.","The girl was rotten inside. Peel off a layer of that beautiful skin, and you\'d find nothing but rotten flesh.","I have a million things to talk to you about. A million things we have to talk about.

A pale silver moon trembles on the face of the water. A wooden boat lashed to a post modulates the sound of the current. Sitting with her, I feel her warm against my arm.","It\'s little strange, perhaps, to make this claim at such a late date, but Gatsby really is an outstanding novel. I never get tired of it, no matter how many times I read it. It\'s the kind of a novel that nourishes you as you read, and every time I do, I\'m struck by something new, and experience a fresh reaction to it. I find it how such a young writer, only twenty-nine at the time could grasp--so insightfully, so equitably, and so warmly--the realities of life. How was that possible? The more I think about it, and the more I read the novel, the more mysterious it all is.","While you\u2019re playing yourself out in lonesome dissipation in front of a pinball machine, someone else might be reading through Proust. Still another might be engaged in heavy petting with a girlfriend at a drive-in theater showing of Paths of Courage.

Now it\'s McCoy Tyner\'s piano solo I hear, the left hand carving out a repetitious rhythm and the right layering on thick, forbidding chords. Like some mythic scene, the music portrays somebody\'s - a nameless, faceless somebody\'s - dim past, all the details laid out as clearly as entrails being dragged out of the darkness. Or at least that\'s how it sounds to me. The patient, repeating music ever so slowly breaks apart the real, rearranging the pieces.

More than half of all children died before they could reach maturity, thanks to chronic epidemics and malnutrition. People dropped like flies from polio and tuberculosis and smallpox and measles. There probably weren\'t many people who lived past forty. Women bore so many children, they became toothless old hags by the time they were in their thirties. People often had to resort to violence to survive. Tiny children were forced to do such heavy labor that their bones became deformed, and little girls were forced to become prostitutes on a daily basis. Little boys too, I suspect. Most people led minimal lives in worlds that had nothing to do with richness of perception or spirit. City streets were full of cripples and beggars and criminals.

And it\u2019s a lot deeper than you think. Deeper\u2026 darker\u2026 colder. But tell me something. How could you have slept with me that time? How could you have done such a thing? Why didn\u2019t you just leave me alone?","Narrow minds devoid of imagination. Intolerance, theories cut off from reality, empty terminology, usurped ideals, inflexible systems. Those are the things that really frighten me. What I absolutely fear and loathe. Individual errors in judgment can usually be corrected. As long as you have the courage to admit mistakes, things can be turned around. But intolerant, narrow minds with no imagination are like parasites that transform the host, change form and continue to thrive.

Your brain is so full of her it\'s ready to burst, your body about to explode into pieces. Still, no matter how much you want her to be here, no matter how long you wait, she never appears. All you hear is the faint rustle of wind outside, birds softly cooing in the night. You hold your breath, staring off into the gloom. You listen to the wind, trying to read something into it, staring to catch a hint of what it might mean. But all that surrounds you are different shades of darkness. Finally, you give up, close your eyes, and fall asleep.","What a wonderful thing it is to find and be found by your 100% perfect other. It\'s a miracle, a cosmic miracle.","This life is nothing but a short, painful dream.","It was as if he felt that the black symbols flowing from his brush onto the pure white paper could somehow lay bare the workings of his heart.","The new day is almost here, but the old one is still dragging its heavy skirts.

Nobody\u2019s going to pay money to see them,\\" he said. \\"Just look around you-they\u2019re everywhere. Same thing with people.","Even though I might go out on a date with a boy, emotionally I just wouldn\u2019t be able to concentrate. I\u2019d be smiling and chatting away, and my mind would be floating around somewhere else, like a balloon with a broken string. I\u2019d be thinking about one unrelated thing after another. I don\u2019t know, I guess finally I want to be alone a little while longer. And I want to let my thoughts wander freely.","It was hard to accept that she had almost no feelings, maybenone at all, for me as a man. This hurt so bad at times it felt likesomeone was gouging out my guts with a knife. Still, the time Ispent with her was more precious than anything.","It\'s hard to stop a war once it starts.

They preached about God\'s kindness, but preached twice as much about his wrath and intolerance.","Most of these university types are total phonies. They\u2019re scared to death somebody\u2019s gonna find they don\u2019t know something. They all read the same books and they all throw around the same words, and they get off listening to John Coltrane and seeing Pasolini movies. You call that \u2018revolution\u2019? That does it for me, then. I\u2019m not going to believe in any damned revolution. Love is all I\u2019m going to believe in.","El destino se lleva siempre su parte y no se retira hasta obtener lo que le corresponde.","From elementary school up to college I was never interested in things I was forced to study. I told myself it was something that had to be done, I only began to enjoy studying after I got through the educational system and became a so-called member of society. If something interested me, and I could study it at my own pace and approach it the way I liked, I was pretty efficient at acquiring knowledge and skills.","Up till a minute ago it felt so real, but now it seems imaginary. Just a few steps is all it takes for everything associated with it to lose all sense of reality. And me--the person who was there until a moment ago--now I seem imaginary too.","Life just isn\u2019t fair, is how it used to strike me. Some people can work their butts off and never get what they\u2019re aiming for, while others can get it without any effort at all.","What I mean to say is probably something like this: any single human being, no matter what kind of person he or she may be, is all caught up in the tentacles of this animal like a giant octopus, and is getting sucked into the darkness. You can put any kind of spin on it you like, but you end up with the same unbearable spectacle.","\u0627\u0644\u0643\u062a\u0627\u0628\u0629 \u0628\u0627\u0644\u0646\u0633\u0628\u0629 \u0644\u064a \u0639\u0645\u0644\u064a\u0629 \u0645\u0624\u0644\u0645\u0629","Then I got undressed and, crawling under the covers, sat up in bed and sipped my drink. I felt like I was going to fade out any second, but I had to allow myself this luxury. A ritual interlude I like so much between the time I get into bed and the time I fall asleep. Having a drink in bed while listening to music and reading a book. As precious to me as a beautiful sunset or good clean air.","After you pass a certain age, things you were able to do easily aren\u2019t so easy anymore \u2014 just as a fastball pitcher\u2019s speed starts to slip away with time. Of course, it\u2019s possible for people as they mature to make up for a decline in natural talent. Like when a fastball pitcher transforms himself into a cleverer pitcher who relies on changeups.

Dawn in Mongolia was an amazing thing. In one instant, the horizon became a faint line suspended in the darkness, and then the line was drawn upward, higher and higher. It was as if a giant hand had stretched down from the sky and slowly lifted the curtain of night from the face of the earth. It was a magnificent sight, far greater in scale, [...] than anything that I, with my limited human faculties, could comprehend. As I sat and watched, the feeling overtook me that my very life was slowly dwindling into nothingness. There was no trace here of anything as insignificant as human undertakings. This same event had been occurring hundreds of millions - hundreds of billions - of times, from an age long before there had been anything resembling life on earth.","I\'ve wanted to find out as much about China as I could. But that China is only my China. Not any China I can read about. It\'s the China that sends messages just to me. It\'s not the big yellow expanse on the globe, it\'s another China. Another hypothesis, another supposition. In a sense, it\'s a part of myself that\'s been cut off by the word China.I wander though China. Without ever having boarded a plane.

It\u2019s pretty obvious: talent. Now matter how much enthusiasm and effort you put into writing, if you totally lack literary talent you can forget about being a novelist. This is more of a prerequisite than a necessary quality. If you don\u2019t have any fuel, even the best car won\u2019t run.The problem with talent, though, is that in most cases the person involved can\u2019t control its amount or quality. You might find the amount isn\u2019t enough and you want to increase it, or you might try to be frugal and make it last longer, but in neither case do things work out that easily. Talent has a mind of its own and wells up when it wants to, and once it dries up, that\u2019s it. Of course, certain poets and rock singers whose genius went out in a blaze of glory\u2014people like Schubert and Mozart, whose dramatic early deaths turned them into legends\u2014have a certain appeal, but for the vast majority of us this isn\u2019t the model we follow.If I\u2019m asked what the next most important quality is for a novelist, that\u2019s easy too: focus\u2014the ability to concentrate all your limited talents on whatever\u2019s critical at the moment. Without that you can\u2019t accomplish anything of value, while, if you can focus effectively, you\u2019ll be able to compensate for an erratic talent or even a shortage of it. I generally concentrate on work for three or four hours every morning. I sit at my desk and focus totally on what I\u2019m writing. I don\u2019t see anything else, I don\u2019t think about anything else.\u2026After focus, the next most important thing for a novelist is, hands down, endurance. If you concentrate on writing three or four hours a day and feel tired after a week of this, you\u2019re not going to be able to write a long work. What\u2019s needed of the writer of fiction\u2014at least one who hopes to write a novel\u2014is the energy to focus every day for half a year, or a year, or two years.\u2026Fortunately, these two disciplines\u2014focus and endurance\u2014are different from talent, since they can be acquired and sharpened through training. You\u2019ll naturally learn both concentration and endurance when you sit down every day at your desk and train yourself to focus on one point. This is a lot like the training of muscles I wrote of a moment ago. You have to continually transmit the object of your focus to your entire body, and make sure it thoroughly assimilates the information necessary for you to write every single day and concentrate on the work at hand. And gradually you\u2019ll expand the limits of what you\u2019re able to do. Almost imperceptibly you\u2019ll make the bar rise. This involves the same process as jogging every day to strengthen your muscles and develop a runner\u2019s physique. Add a stimulus and keep it up. And repeat. Patience is a must in this process, but I guarantee results will come.In private correspondence the great mystery writer Raymond Chandler once confessed that even if he didn\u2019t write anything, he made sure he sat down at his desk every single day and concentrated. I understand the purpose behind his doing this. This is the way Chandler gave himself the physical stamina a professional writer needs, quietly strengthening his willpower. This sort of daily training was indispensable to him.\u2026Most of what I know about writing I\u2019ve learned through running every day. These are practical, physical lessons. How much can I push myself? How much rest is appropriate\u2014and how much is too much? How far can I take something and still keep it decent and consistent? When does it become narrow-minded and inflexible? How much should I be aware of the world outside, and how much should I focus on my inner world? To what extent should I be confident in my abilities, and when should I start doubting myself? I know that if I hadn\u2019t become a long-distance runner when I became a novelist, my work would have been vastly different. How different? Hard to say. But something would definitely have been different.","I don\u2019t mind ironing at all.

When the four of them rejected me, perhaps this young man named Tsukuru Tazaki really did pass away. Only his exterior remained, but just barely, and then over the course of the next half year, even that shell was replaced, as his body and face underwent a drastic change. The feeling of the wind, the sound of rushing water, the sense of sunlight breaking through the clouds, the colors of flowers as the seasons changed - everything around him felt changed, as if they had all been recast. The person here now, the one he saw in the mirror, might at first glance resemble Tsukuru Tazaki, but it wasn\'t actually him. It was merely a container, was labeled with the same name - but its contents had been replaced. He was called by that name because there was, for the time being, no other name to call him.","Then, all but instinctively, I took her in my arms. Pressed against me, her whole body trembling, she continued to cry without a sound.","The sad truth is that what I could recall in five seconds all too soon needed ten, then thirty, thena full minute...","Some things can\'t be solved just by going wild every now and then.","It must be hard to pass your twentieth birthday alone.","It was a day like a slow-motion video of twilight.

We need to deftly reconcile ourselves with time, and leave behind as many precious memories as we can\u2014that\u2019s what\u2019s the most valuable.","A cat met up with a big male rat in the attic and chased him into a corner. The rat, trembling, said, \u2018Please don\u2019t eat me, Mr. Cat. I have to go back to my family. I have hungry children waiting for me. Please let me go.\u2019 The cat said, \u2018Don\u2019t worry, I won\u2019t eat you. To tell you the truth, I can\u2019t say this too loudly, but I\u2019m a vegetarian. I don\u2019t eat any meat. You were lucky to run into me.\u2019 The rat said, \u2018Oh, what a wonderful day! What a lucky rat I am to meet up with a vegetarian cat!\u2019 But the very next second, the cat pounced on the rat, held him down with his claws, and sank his sharp teeth into the rat\u2019s throat. With his last, painful breath, the rat asked him, \u2018But Mr. Cat, didn\u2019t you say you\u2019re a vegetarian and don\u2019t eat any meat? Were you lying to me?\u2019 The cat licked his chops and said, \u2018True, I don\u2019t eat meat. That was no lie. I\u2019m going to take you home in my mouth and trade you for lettuce.\u2019","a person\u2019s mind is controlled by his body, right? Or is it the opposite\u2014the way your mind works influences the structure of the body? Or do the body and mind closely influence each other and act on each other? What I do know is that people have certain inborn tendencies, and whether a person likes them or not, they\u2019re inescapable. Tendencies can be adjusted, to a degree, but their essence can never be changed.","Becoming serious was not the same thing as approaching truth, I sensed, however vaguely. But death was a fact, a serious fact, no matter how you looked at it. Stuck inside this suffocating contradiction, I went on endlessly spinning in circles. Those were strange days, now that I look back at them. In the midst of life, everything revolved around death.","Seeing a lot of water like that every day is probably an important thing for human beings. For human beings might be a bit of a generalization\u2014but I do know it\u2019s important for one person: me. If I go for a time without seeing water, I feel like something\u2019s slowly draining out of me. It\u2019s probably like the feeling a music lover has when, for whatever reason, he\u2019s separated from music for a long time.

Maybe that\u2019s why you don\u2019t understand what I am saying. Let me give you an example. Once you pass a certain age, life becomes nothing more than a process of continual loss. Things that are important to your life begin to slip out of your grasp, one after another, like a comb losing teeth. And the only things that come to take their place are worthless imitations. Your physical strength, your hopes, your dreams, your ideals, your convictions, all meaning, or, then again, the people you love: one by one, they fade away. Some announce their departure before they leave, while others just disappear all of a sudden without warning one day. And once you lose them you can never get them back. Your search for replacements never goes well. It\u2019s all very painful\u2014as painful as actually being cut with a knife. You will be turning thirty soon, Mr. Kawana, which means that, from now on, you will gradually enter that twilight portion of life\u2014you will be getting older. You are probably beginning to grasp that painful sense that you are losing something, are you not?","Pero as\xed como no hay que temer a los moldes, tampoco hay que tener miedo de romperlos.","And it came to me then. That we were wonderful travelling companions, but in the end no more than lonely lumps of metal on their own separate orbits. From far off they look like beautiful shooting stars, but in reality they\'re nothing more than prisons, where each of us is locked up alone, going nowhere","Right now I\u2019m aiming at increasing the distance I run, so speed is less of an issue. As long as I can run a certain distance, that\u2019s all I care about. Sometimes I run fast when I feel like it, but if I increase the pace I shorten the amount of time I run, the point being to let the exhilaration I feel at the end of each run carry over to the next day. This is the same tack I find necessary when writing a novel. I stop every day right at the point where I feel I can write no more. Do that, and the next day\u2019s work goes surprisingly smoothly. I think Ernest Hemmingway did something like that. To keep on going, you have to keep up the rhythm. This is the important thing for long-term projects. Once you set the pace, the rest will follow. The problem is getting the flywheel to spin at a set speed \u2013 and to get to that point takes as much concentration and effort as you can manage.","Por m\xe1s que escondamos los recuerdos, jam\xe1s podemos cambiar lo que ya ha ocurrido.","Talent is like a container. You can work as hard as you want, but the size will never change. It\u2019ll only hold so much water and no more.","Nakata\u2019s empty inside. I finally understand that. Nakata\u2019s like a library without a single book. It wasn\u2019t always like that. I used to have books inside me. For a long time I couldn\u2019t remember, but now I can. I used to be normal, just like everybody else. But something happened and I ended up like a container with nothing inside.","I could drink my coffee, read my book, pass the time of day without any special thought, all because I was part of the regular scenery. Here I had no ties to anyone. Fact is, I\'d come to reclaim myself.","It wasn\u2019t what I\u2019d characterize as a happy part of my life, living as I was, a balled-up mass of unfulfilled desires. I was much younger, much hungrier, much more alone. But I was myself, pared down to the essentials.","I seriously believed I could escape myself\u2013as long as I made the effort. But I always hit a dead end. No matter where I go, I still end up me. What\u2019s missing never changes. The scenery may change, but I\u2019m still the same old incomplete person. The same missing elements torture me with a hunger that I can never satisfy. I guess that lack itself is as close as I\u2019ll come to defining myself.","Killing time is not an easy job","Seabird tracks scattered about the surf\'s edge like pine needles after a brisk wind.","Until that time, I had understood death as something entirely separate from and independent of life. The hand of death is about to take us, I had felt, but until the day it reaches out for us, it leaves us alone. This had seemed to me the simple, logical truth. Life is here, death is over there. I am here, not over there. That night Kizuki died, however, I lost the ability to see death (and life) in such simple terms. Death was not the opposite of life. It was already here, within my being, it had always been here, and no struggle would permit me to forget that. When it took the 17-year-old Kizuki that night in May, death took me as well.","The tomatoes and string beans were but chilled shadows. Tasteless shadows. Nor was there any taste to the coffee or crackers. Maybe because of the morning sun? The light of morning decomposes everything.","She leaves behind a damp pillow, wet with her tears. You touch the warmthwith your hand and watch the sky outside gradually lighten. Far away a crow caws.The Earth slowly keeps on turning. But beyond any of those details of the real,there are dreams. And everyone\'s living in them.","I just got my signals crossed. First thing, I have to untangle the connections. Otherwise, I come away empty-handed. Or with someone else\'s hands. Or even with a missing hand.","That is why it is necessary for you to fasten your feelings to the earth\u2014firmly, like attaching an anchor to a balloon.","Whether you want to or not.

I can hear it happening. I\'m totally lost, my identity dying.","If sympathy was all it took to clean up shit, I\'d have 50 times as much sympathy as anybody else","Tengo\'s lectures took on uncommon warmth, and the students found themselves swept up in his eloquence. He taught them how to practically and effectively solve mathematical problems while simultaneously presenting a spectacular display of the romance concealed in the questions it posed. Tengo saw admiration in the eyes of several of his female students, and he realized that he was seducing these seventeen- or eighteen-year-olds through mathematics. His eloquence was a kind of intellectual foreplay. Mathematical functions stroked their backs; theorems sent warm breath into their ears.","I also happened to identify with Julien Sorel. Sorel\'s basic character flaws had all cemented by the age of fifteen, a fact which further elicited my sympathy. To have all the building blocks of your life in place by that age was, by any standard, a tragedy.","the mind is lost when the shadow dies.","When Reiko left, I stretched out on the sofa and closed my eyes. I lay there steeping myself into silence when, out of nowhere, I thought of the time Kizuki and I took a motorcycle trip. That had been autumn too, I realized. Autumn how many years ago? Yes, four years ago. I recalled the small of Kizuki\'s leather jacket and the racket made by that red Yamaha 125cc bike. We went to a spot far down the coast, and came back the same evening, exhausted. Nothing special happened on that trip, but I remembered it well. the sharp autumn wind moaned in my ears, and looking up at the sky, my hands clutching Kizuki\'s jacket, I felt as if I might be swept into outer space.","The minute you leave your house, all phones sound alike.","I could do just about anything if somebody made me. But I don\'t have an image of the one thing I really want to do. That\'s my problem now. I can\'t find the image... I\'m standing still, and I can\'t find the image.- Toru","Aomame said, \\"It\'s like the Tibetan Wheel of the Passions.

When she forced it, she ended up with a tight sneer, which made others even more tense and uncomfortable. Tamaki was different: she had a natural, cheerful smile. People meeting her for the first time immediately felt friendly toward her. In the end, though, disappointment and despair drove Tamaki to take her own life, leaving Aomame \u2013 who couldn\u2019t manage a decent smile \u2013 behind.","If I sound as if I\'m always predicting ominous things, it\'s because I\'m a pragmatist. I use deductive reasoning to generalize, and I suppose this sometimes ends up sounding like unlucky prophecies. You know why? Because reality\'s just the accumulation of ominous prophecies come to life. You have to only open a newspaper on any given day and weigh the good news versus the bad, and you\'ll see what I mean.","I don\u2019t know much about the world, but I do know one thing for sure. If I\u2019m pessimistic, then the adults in this world who are not pessimistic are a bunch of idiots.","Too many memories of her were crammed inside of me, and as soon as one of them found the slightest opening, the rest would force their way out in an endless stream, an unstoppable flood.","A smile like a small wisp of smoke drifting quietly skyward on a windless day.","Aomame closed her eyes and, in a split second, reviewed the long span of years as if standing on the edge of a sheer cliff, surveying an ocean channel below. She could smell the sea. She could hear the deep sighing of the wind.","Act that way and slowly but surely I will fade away. All the dawns and all the twilights will rob me, piece by piece, of myself, and before long my very life will be shaved away completely - and I would end up nothing.","Uno de mis libros preferidos","I try imagining myself in forty years, but it\u2019s like trying to picture what lies beyond the universe.","It made me wonder how other people saw me.

So said Voltaire, the realist.","It was just that, no matter where I found myself, I felt like there was a hole inside me, with the wind rushing through. I never felt satisfied. From the outside you wouldn\u2019t imagine I had any troubles.","that we are in here not to correct the deformation but to accustom ourselves to it: that one of our problems was our inability to recognize and accept our own deformities. Just as each person has certain idiosyncrasies in the way he or she walks, people have idiosyncrasies in the way they think and feel and see things, and though you might want to correct them, it doesn\u2019t happen overnight, and if you try to force the issue in one case, something else might go funny.","But that reality was like nothing I\'d ever seen before: a reality that didn\'t seem to fit.","Haven\u2019t you offered up some part of your Self to someone (or something), and taken on a \u201cnarrative in return?

If \'complex\' is too strong a word, let\'s just say she probably envied you.Excerpt From: Haruki Murakami. \u201cAfter Dark.\u201d iBooks.\u201d","- \u041e\u0431\u0438\u0447\u0430\u043c \u0442\u0430\u0437\u0438 \u043c\u0443\u0437\u0438\u043a\u0430, \u0437\u0430\u0449\u043e\u0442\u043e \u0442\u044f \u0442\u0438 \u043e\u0442\u0432\u0430\u0440\u044f \u043f\u0440\u043e\u0441\u0442\u0440\u0430\u043d\u0441\u0442\u0432\u043e.- \u041f\u0440\u043e\u0441\u0442\u0440\u0430\u043d\u0441\u0442\u0432\u043e \u043b\u0438?- \u0421 \u0435\u0434\u043d\u0430 \u0434\u0443\u043c\u0430, \u043a\u043e\u0433\u0430\u0442\u043e \u044f \u0441\u043b\u0443\u0448\u0430\u043c, \u0438\u043c\u0430\u043c \u0447\u0443\u0432\u0441\u0442\u0432\u043e\u0442\u043e, \u0447\u0435 \u0441\u0435 \u043d\u0430\u043c\u0438\u0440\u0430\u043c \u0441\u0440\u0435\u0434 \u0448\u0438\u0440\u043e\u043a\u043e \u043f\u0443\u0441\u0442\u043e \u043f\u0440\u043e\u0441\u0442\u0440\u0430\u043d\u0441\u0442\u0432\u043e. \u041d\u0435\u043e\u0431\u044f\u0442\u043d\u043e, \u0431\u0435\u0437 \u043d\u0438\u043a\u0430\u043a\u0432\u0438 \u043f\u0440\u0435\u0433\u0440\u0430\u0434\u0438. \u041d\u0438\u0442\u043e \u0441\u0442\u0435\u043d\u0438, \u043d\u0438\u0442\u043e \u0442\u0430\u0432\u0430\u043d. \u041d\u0435 \u043c\u0438 \u0441\u0435 \u043d\u0430\u043b\u0430\u0433\u0430 \u0434\u0430 \u043c\u0438\u0441\u043b\u044f \u0437\u0430 \u043d\u0435\u0449\u043e, \u0434\u0430 \u043a\u0430\u0437\u0432\u0430\u043c \u043d\u0435\u0449\u043e, \u0434\u0430 \u043f\u0440\u0430\u0432\u044f \u043d\u0435\u0449\u043e. \u041f\u0440\u043e\u0441\u0442\u043e \u0434\u0430 \u0441\u0438 \u0441\u0435\u0434\u044f \u0442\u0430\u043c. \u0414\u0430 \u0437\u0430\u0442\u0432\u043e\u0440\u044f \u043e\u0447\u0438 \u0438 \u0434\u0430 \u0441\u0435 \u043e\u0441\u0442\u0430\u0432\u044f \u0434\u0430 \u043c\u0435 \u0438\u0437\u043f\u044a\u043b\u043d\u0438 \u0432\u044a\u0437\u0445\u0438\u0442\u0438\u0442\u0435\u043b\u043d\u0438\u044f\u0442 \u0437\u0432\u0443\u043a \u043d\u0430 \u0441\u0442\u0440\u0443\u043d\u043d\u0438\u0442\u0435. \u0411\u0435\u0437 \u0433\u043b\u0430\u0432\u043e\u0431\u043e\u043b\u0438\u0435 \u0438 \u0438\u0437\u043c\u0440\u044a\u0437\u0432\u0430\u043d\u0435 \u043d\u0430 \u043a\u0440\u0430\u0439\u043d\u0438\u0446\u0438\u0442\u0435, \u0431\u0435\u0437 \u043c\u0435\u043d\u0441\u0442\u0440\u0443\u0430\u0446\u0438\u044f \u0438 \u043e\u0432\u0443\u043b\u0430\u0446\u0438\u044f. \u0422\u0430\u043c \u0432\u0441\u0438\u0447\u043a\u043e \u0435 \u0438\u0437\u043a\u043b\u044e\u0447\u0438\u0442\u0435\u043b\u043d\u043e \u043a\u0440\u0430\u0441\u0438\u0432\u043e, \u0441\u043f\u043e\u043a\u043e\u0439\u043d\u043e, \u043f\u043e\u0441\u0442\u0438\u0436\u0438\u043c\u043e. \u041d\u0435 \u043c\u043e\u0436\u0435\u0448 \u0434\u0430 \u0438\u0441\u043a\u0430\u0448 \u043d\u0438\u0449\u043e \u043f\u043e\u0432\u0435\u0447\u0435.","M.: Do you think Mahler thought he was doing something avant-garde?O.: I don\u2019t think so.M.: Schoenberg and Alban Berg were certainly conscious of being avant-garde, though.O.: Oh, very much so. They had their \u201cmethod. Mahler had no such thing.M.: So he flirted with chaos, not as a methodology, but naturally and instinctively. Is that what you are saying?O.: Yes. Isn\u2019t that exactly where his genius lies?\u201d","There are all kinds of things we have to deal with in life,\u2019 Eri finally said. \u2018And one thing always seems to connect with another. You try to solve one problem, only to find that another one you hadn\u2019t anticipated arises instead. It\u2019s not that easy to get free of them. That\u2019s true for you \u2013 and for me, too.","Good and evil are not fixed, stable entities but are continually trading places. A good may be transformed into an evil in the next second. And vice versa. Such was the way of the world that Dostoevsky depicted in The Brothers Karamazov. The most important thing is to maintain the balance between the constantly moving good and evil. If you lean too much in either direction, it becomes difficult to maintain actual morals. Indeed, balance itself is the good.","I never want to be bound to anything. I always want to be able to come and go as I please.","While they\u2019re still alive, people can become ghosts.","This lady has deep feelings for Tengo, Ushikawa thought admiringly. Almost a kind of unconditional love. What would it feel like to be loved that deeply by someone else?","The weather service reported that there weren\'t any atmospheric conditions present that might have led to fish raining from the sky.","We\'re on the border of this world, speaking a common language. That\'s all.","Sometimes you\u2019re just the sweetest thing.

She\'s only thirteen, though.\\"\\"You slept with a thirteen-year-old girl?\\"\\"What Do you think I am?

Motion passed by unanimous vote.","Strange as it may seem\u2014or perhaps it does not seem so strange\u2014they all had the same thought: it was so much easier to kill humans on the battlefield than animals in cages, even if, on the battlefield, one might end up being killed oneself.","I can\'t read, can\'t listen to music. I can\'t do anything but just sit there, waiting for morning to come.","I was also motivated by a strong sense of fear that we had still not begun to deal with, let alone solve, any of the fundamental issues arising from the gas attack. Specifically, for people who are outside the main system of Japanese society (the young in particular), there remains no effective alternative or safety net. As long as this crucial gap exists in our society, like a kind of black hole, even if Aum is suppressed, other magnetic force fields\u2014\\"Aum-like\\" groups\u2014will rise up again, and similar incidents are bound to take place.","Prvo, o du\u0161i.

Samo tamo gdje postoje razo\u010darenje, poti\u0161tenost i tuga javlja se i sre\u0107a; bez o\u010daja zbog gubitka nema ni nade.","I do feel that I\'ve managed to make something I could maybe call my own world ... over time ... little by little. And when I\'m inside it, to some extent, I feel kind of relieved. But the very fact I felt I had to make such a world probably means that, I am a weak person, that I bruise easily, don\'t you think? And in the eyes of society at large, that world of mine is a puny little thing.","Lumea in care traim noi nu e decat un urias apartament de prezentare.Intri, te asezi, bei un ceai , admiri privelistea de la geam, multumesti si pleci.","Still, her plumpness was charming. Resting an ear on her hip was like lying in a meadow on an idyllic spring afternoon, her thighs as soft as freshly aired futon, the rolling flow of her curves leading gracefully to her pubis. When I complimented her on her qualities, though, all she said was, \\"Oh yeah?","Putting it into words will destroy any meaning.","But I\u2019m not dead. I just disappeared. I do that. I move into another world, a different world. Like boarding a train running parallel. That\u2019s what disappearing is. Don\u2019t you see?","The point is, it didn\u2019t even look like my face. It was the face of any twenty-four-year-old guy who might have been sitting across the way on the commuter train.My face, my self, what would they mean to anybody? Just another stiff. So this self of mine passes some other\u2019s self on the street \u2013 what do weh ave to say to each other? Hey there! Hi ya!That\u2019s about it. Nobody raises a hand. No one turns around to take another look.","Telling people her name was always a bother. As soon as the name left her lips, the other person looked puzzled or confused.","Un buen d\xeda, de repente, te conviertes en un hombre sin mujer. Ese d\xeda sobreviene de repente, sin mediar el menor indicio o aviso, sin corazonadas ni presentimientos, sin llamar a la puerta y sin carraspeos. Al doblar la esquina, te das cuenta de que ya est\xe1s all\xed. Y no puedes dar marcha atr\xe1s. Una vez que doblas la esquina, se convierte en tu \xfanico mundo. En ese mundo pasan a decir que eres uno de esos \\"hombres sin mujeres\\". En un plural g\xe9lido.","The further we traveled in the darkness, the more I began to feel estranged from my body. I couldn\'t see it, and after a while, you start to think the body is nothing but a hypothetical construct.","There was a small stand of trees nearby, and from it you could hear the mechanical cry of a bird that sounded as if it were winding a spring. We called it the wind-up bird. Kumiko gave it the name. We didn\'t know what it was really called or what it looked like, but that didn\'t bother the wind-up bird. Every day it would come to the stand of trees in our neighborhood and wind the spring of our quiet little world.","He was dead tired, thanks to which, whatever emotions he might have had, simply came and went without gaining a foothold. The Rat began to relax and lay down his empty head on the mingled sounds of the waves and the deejay until sleep crept over him.","They tell us that the only thing we have to fear is fear itself, but I don\'t believe that,\' he said. Then, a moment later, he added: \'Oh, the fear is there, all right. It comes to us in many different forms, at different times, and overwhelms us. But the most frightening thing we can do at such times is to turn our backs on it, to close our eyes. For then we take the most precious thing inside us and surrender it to something else.","Reality recedes until you can\'t tell who\'s sane and who\'snot.","Creative business seminar. Basically a quick, impromptu brainwashing course to educate your typical corporate warriors. They use a training manual instead of sacred scriptures, with promotion and a high salary as their equivalent of enlightenment and paradise. A new religion for a pragmatic age. No transcendent elements like in a religion, though, and everything is theorized and digitalized. Very transparent and easy to grasp. And quite a few people get positive encouragement from this. But the fact remains that it\u2019s nothing more than an infusion of the hypnotic into a system of thought that suits their goal, a conglomeration of only those theories and statistics that line up with their ultimate objectives.","When everything\u2019s twisted, what\u2019s normal ends up looking weird too.","Like Naokuo, I\'m not really sure what it means to love another person. Though she meant it a little differently. I do want to try my best though. I have to, or else I won\'t know where to go. Like you said before, Naoko and I have to save each other. It\'s the only was for us to be saved!","Strangely transparent, they seemed like windows to a world beyond, but however long I peered into there depths, there was nothing I could see.","Latter-day capitalism. Like it or not, it\'s the society we live in. Even the standard of right and wrong has been subdivided, made sophisticated. Within good, there\'s fashionable good and unfashionable good, and ditto for bad. Within fashionable good, there\'s formal and then there\'s casual; there\'s hip, there\'s cool, there\'s trendy, there\'s snobbish. Mix \'n\' match. Like pulling on a Missoni sweater over Trussardi slacks and Pollini shoes, you can now enjoy hybrid styles of morality. It\'s the way of the world -- philosophy starting to look more and more like business administration.","An imperfect person living an imperfect, limited life.","A person\'s life may be a lonely thing by nature, but it is not isolated. To that life other lives are linked.","He calmed himself, shut his eyes, and fell asleep. The rear light of consciousness, like the last express train of the night, began to fade into the distance, gradually speeding up, growing smaller until it was, finally, sucked into the depths of night, where it disappeared. All that remained was the sound of the wind slipping through a stand of white birch trees.","We\u2019re talking about people, not common denominators.","Des occasions pr\xe9cieuses, des possibilit\xe9s, des sentiments qu\u2019on ne pourra pas retrouver. C\u2019est cela aussi, vivre. Mais \xe0 l\u2019int\xe9rieur de notre esprit \u2013 je crois que c\u2019est \xe0 l\u2019int\xe9rieur de notre esprit, il y a une petite pi\xe8ce dans laquelle nous stockons le souvenir de toutes ces occasions perdues.

Et il faut que nous fabriquions un index, avec des cartes de r\xe9f\xe9rences, pour conna\xeetre pr\xe9cis\xe9ment ce qu\u2019il y a dans nos c\u0153urs. Il faut aussi balayer cette pi\xe8ce, l\u2019a\xe9rer, changer l\u2019eau des fleurs. En d\u2019autres termes, tu devras vivre dans ta propre biblioth\xe8que.","This is pretty obvious, but until things happen, they haven\'t happened. And often things aren\'t what they seem.","It doesn\'t matter what form she takes - a living spirit, an illusion - but you have to see her, have to have her beside you. Your brain is so full of her it\'s ready to burst, your body about to explode into pieces. Still, no matter how much you want her to be here, no matter how long you wait, she never appears. All you hear is the faint rustle of wind outside, birds softly cooing in the night. You hold your breath, staring off into the gloom. You listen to the wind, trying to read something into it, staring to catch a hint of what it might mean. But all that surrounds you are different shades of darkness. Finall, you up, close your eyes, and fall asleep.","And you came to Finland to build a station?\\"\\"No I came here on vacation to visit a friend.\\"\\"That\'s good,\\" the driver said. \\"Vacations and friends are the two best things in life.","Sara said she has feelings for me. He had no reason to doubt it. But there are countless things in the world for which affection is not enough. Life is long, and sometimes cruel . Sometimes victims are needed. Someone has to take on that role. And human bodies are fragile, easily damaged. Cut them, and they bleed.","The warmth and the pain came as a pair, and unless he accepted the pain, he wouldn\'t feel the warmth. It was a kind of trade off.","Deber\xeda haberme tomado en serio sus sentimientos, abrazarla con fuerza. Eso era lo que ella buscaba. Ser aceptada y abrazada sin condiciones. Deber\xeda haberle hecho sentirse segura aunque s\xf3lo fuera una vez.","Whenever I got home late, I\'d always go to my son\'s room first, to see his sleeping face. Sometimes I was seized by a desire to squeeze him so hard he might break.","and as long as I kept my body moving I could forget about the emptiness inside.","En muchos casos, el dolor se puede mitigar y suprimir mediante otro dolor diferente. La sensibilidad es algo completamente relativo.","I miss you terribly sometimes, but in general I go on living with all the energy I can muster. Just as you take care of the birds and the fields every morning, every morning I wind my own spring.","Coba kau pikirkan baik-baik. Kondisi semua orang sama saja. Sama seperti ketika kita naik pesawat rusak. Tentu saja di situ ada orang yang bernasib baik dan bernasib buruk. Ada yang tangguh, ada juga yang lemah; ada yang kaya, ada pula yang miskin. Hanya saja, tidak ada orang yang memiliki kekuatan yang jauh lebih besar daripada orang lain. Semua orang sama. Orang yang memiliki sesuatu selalu khawatir, jangan-jangan apa yang dia miliki sekarang akan hilang, sedangkan orang yang tidak memiliki apa-apa selalu cemas, jangan-jangan selamanya aku akan tetap menjadi orang yang tidak punya apa-apa. Semua orang sama! Karena itu, manusia yang menyadari hal itu lebih cepat harus berusaha menjadi sedikit lebih tangguh. Sekadar pura-pura pun tidak apa. Betul kan? Di mana pun tidak akan ada manusia yang tangguh. Yang ada hanyalah manusia yang pura-pura tangguh.","Realizing all over again how important sunlight is to human beings, I appreciate each second of that precious light. The intense loneliness and helplessness I felt under those millions of stars has vanished","piensa que el hecho de que no existan luchas, odio ni deseos significa que tampoco existen las cosas opuestas.

Es imposible encontrar una paz de esp\xedritu sin desesperaci\xf3n","It was a different sense of isolation from what he normally felt in Japan. And not such a bad feeling, he decided. Being alone in two senses of the word was maybe like a double negation of isolation. In other words, it made perfect sense for him, a foreigner, to feel isolated here. The thought calmed him. He was in exactly the right place.","If you look at it the other way round, that\'s the only reason why this world is inside of me. Maybe it\'s a paradox, like an image reflected to infinity in a pair of facing mirrors. I am a part of this world, and this world is a part of me.","The ones with no imagination are always the quickest to justify themselves","Even the darkest, thickest cloud shines silver when viewed from above.","I might have been afraid that if I really loved someone and needed her, one day she might suddenly disappear without a word, and I\'d be left all alone.","Two people can sleep in the same bed and still be alone when they close their eyes, if you know what I mean.","My husband and I see each other only on weekends, and generally get along well. We\'re like good friends, life partners able to spend some pleasant time together. We talk about all sorts of things, and we trust each other implicitly. Where and how he has a sex life I don\'t know,and I don\'t really care. We never make love, though -- never even touch each other. I feel bad about it, but I don\'t want to touch him. I just don\'t want to.","Subject and object are not as distinct as most people think. If the boundary separating the two isn\'t clear-cut to begin with, it is not such a difficult task to intentionally shift back and forth from one to the other.","People grow up, and when they grow up they change/","Finally, as the sky began to grow light in the morning, I\u2019d feel that I might be drifting off. But that wasn\u2019t sleep. My fingertips were just barely brushing against the outermost edge of sleep. And all the while, my mind was awake. I would feel a hint of drowsiness, but my mind was there, in its own room, on the other side of a transparent wall, watching me. My physical self was drifting through the feeble morning light, and all the while it could feel my mind staring, breathing, close beside it. I was both a body on the verge of sleep and a mind determined to stay awake.The incomplete drowsiness would continue on and off all day. My head was always foggy. I couldn\u2019t get an accurate fix on the things around me\u2014their distance or mass or texture. The drowsiness would overtake me at regular, wavelike intervals: on the subway, in the classroom, at the diner table. My mind would slip away from my body. The world would sway soundlessly. I would drop things. My pencil or my purse or my fork would clatter to the floor. All I wanted was to throw myself down and sleep. But I couldn\u2019t. The wakefulness was always there beside me. I could feel its chilling shadow. It was the shadow of myself. Weird, I would think as the drowsiness overtook me, I\u2019m in my own shadow. I would walk and eat and talk to people inside my drowsiness. And the strangest thing was that no one noticed. I lost fifteen pounds that month, and no one noticed. No one in my family, not one of my friends or classmates, realized that I was going through life asleep.It was literally true: I was going through life asleep. My body had no more feeling than a drowned corpse. My very existence, my life in the world, seemed like a hallucination. A strong wind would make me think that my body was about to be blown to the end of the earth, to some land I had never seen or heard of, where my mind and body would separate forever. Hold tight, I would tell myself, but there was nothing for me to hold on to.","Darkness had spread over my skin like ink.","People do change. And no matter how close we once were, and how much we opened up to each other, maybe neither if us know anything substantial about the other.","He was going to die soon, you knew when you saw those eyes. There was no sign of life in his flesh, just the barest traces of what had once been a life. His body was like a dilapidated old house from which all furniture and fixtures have been removed and which awaited now only its final demolition. Around the dry lips sprouted clumps of whiskers like so many weeds. So, I thought, even after so much of his life force had been lost, a man\'s beard continued to grow.","Aquel silencio recordaba todas las lluvias del mundo cayendo sobre la faz de la Tierra.","Mas, vendo bem, e se me \xe9 permitido um lugar-comum corriqueiro, n\xe3o ser\xe1 que at\xe9 as coisas in\xfateis t\xeam cabimento neste mundo longe-de-ser-perfeito?

Had the stars been wiped out of the sky three months ago, I wouldn\'t have known. The only things I noticed were silver bracelets on women\'s wrists and popsicle sticks in potted rubber plants.

I made up some answers and went to sleep, but next morning she said she wanted to have breakfast with me, and she kept up the stream of questions over the tasteless eggs and toast and coffee.

I understood, of course, that over time, and as circumstances changed, a couple could grow closer, or move apart. Changes in a person\'s feelings aren\'t regulated by custom, logic, or the law.

But these were all just generalizations, and I couldn\'t easily grasp the individual case here-that this woman, Yuzu, refused to love this man, me, and chose instead to be loved by someone else. It felt terribly absurd, a horribly ugly way to be treated. There wasn\'t any anger involved (I think). I mean, what was I supposed to be angry with? What I was feeling was a fundamental numbness.

When those wonderful passages are there, I feel joy, and when some parts are not so wonderful, I listen with a touch of regret. Beyond that, I might pause to think about what makes a certain passage wonderful or not so wonderful, but other musical elements are not that important to me. Basically, I believe that music exists to make people happy. In order to do so, those who make music use a wide range of techniques and methods which, in all their complexity, fascinate me in the simplest possible way.","Becoming a different person might be hard, but taking on a different name is a cinch.","It\'s not so strange that when your memories change, the world changes.","Unable to sleep after the others had drowsed off, I crawled out of the tent and lay on the ground, looking at the sky.

All we can do is see that sadness through to the end and learn something from it, but what we learn will be no help in facing the next sadness that comes to us without warning.","I was always attracted not by some quantifiable, external beauty, but by something deep down, something absolute.

mind, a word, an image, whatever. In most cases it\'s like jazz improvisation, with the story taking me where it wants to. And another good point is that with short stories you don\'t have to worry about failing. If the idea doesn\'t work out the way you hoped it would, you just shrug your shoulders and tell yourself that they can\'t all be winners. Even with masters of the genre like F. Scott Fitzgerald and Raymond Carver -even Anton Chekhov- not every short story is a masterpiece. I find this a great comfort. You can learn from your mistakes (in other words, those you can\'t call complete success) and use that in the next story you write.","Relax, let your guard down. You\u2019re all tensed up so you always expect the worst. Relax your body, and the rest of you will lighten up.","You need to use the thread of logic, as best you can, to skillfully sew onto yourself everything that\u2019s worth living for.","To tell the truth, I don\u2019t really understand the causes behind my runner\u2019s blues. Or why now it\u2019s beginning to fade. It\u2019s too early to explain it well. Maybe the only thing I can definitely say about it is this: That\u2019s life. Maybe the only thing we can do is accept it, without really knowing what\u2019s going on. Like taxes, the tide rising and falling, John Lennon\u2019s death, and miscalls by referees at the World Cup.","We should consider ourselves lucky that the red light is so clearly visible.","Presently, I sense within me the slightest touch. The harmony of one chord lingers in my mind. It fuses, divides, searches--but for what? I open my eyes, position the fingers of my right hand on the buttons, and play out a series of permutations.After a time, I am able, as if by will, to locate the first four notes. They drift down from inward skies, softly, as early morning sunlight. They find me; these are the notes I have been seeking.I hold down the chord key and press the individual notes over and over again. The four notes seem to desire further notes, another chord. I strain to hear the chord that follows. The first four notes lead me to the next five, then to another chord and three more notes.It is a melody. Not a complete song, but the first phrase of one. I play the three chords and twelve notes, also, over and over again. It is a song, I realize, I know.","For instance, supposing that the planet earth were not a sphere but a gigantic coffee table,how much difference in everyday life would that make? Granted, this is a prettyfarfetched example; you can\'t rearrange facts of life so freely. Still, picturing the planetearth, for convenience sake, as a gigantic coffee table does in fact help clear away theclutter\u2014those practically pointless contingencies such as gravity and the internationaldateline and the equator, those nagging details that arise from the spherical view. I mean,for a guy leading a perfectly ordinary existence, how many times in the course of alifetime would the equator be a significant factor?","Day after day I took part in producing nothingness.

I\u2019m tired of living unable to love anyone. I don\u2019t have a single friend\u2014not one. And, worst of all, I can\u2019t even love myself. Why is that? Why can\u2019t I love myself? It\u2019s because I can\u2019t love anyone else. A person learns how to love himself through the simple acts of loving and being loved by someone else. Do you understand what I am saying? A person who is incapable of loving another cannot properly love himself. No, I\u2019m not blaming you for this. Come to think of it, you may be such a victim. You probably don\u2019t know how to love yourself. Am I wrong about that?","Memories are what warm you up from the inside.

The horizon was still etched in a faint glow, and stars began to blink on in the deep, wine-colored sky. I gazed among them for the light of a satellite, but it was still too bright out to spot one with the naked eye. The sprinkling of the stars looked nailed to the spot, unmoving. I closed my eyes and listened carefully for the descendants of Sputnik, even now circling the earth, gravity their only tie to the planet.

At certain points in our lives, when we really need a clear-cut solution, the person who knocks at our door is, more likely than not, a messenger bearing bad news. It isn\'t always the case, but from experience I\'d say the gloomy reports far outnumber the others. The messenger touches his hand to his cap and looks apologetic, but that does nothing to improve the contents of the message. It isn\'t the messenger\'s fault. No good to blame him, no good to grab him by the collar and shake him. The messenger is just conscientiously doing the job his boss assigned him. And this boss?

It may be tough, but sometimes you\u2019ve got to just stop and take time. You ought to train yourself to look at things with your own eyes until something comes clear. And don\u2019t be afraid of putting some time into it. Spending plenty of time on something can be the most sophisticated form of revenge.","That\'s not hard work.

Everything, including a stone. They all know us very well. From top to bottom. It only occurs to us at certain times. And all we can do is go with those things.

The creaking plot had the captain and first officer constantly at each other\u2019s throat. The submarine was a fossil, and one guy had claustrophobia. But all that didn\u2019t stop everything from working out well in the end. It was an everything-works-out-in-the-end-so-maybe-war\u2019s-not-so-bad-after-all sort of film.

At some point in time, the world I knew either vanished or withdrew, and another world came to take its place. Like the switching of a track. In other words, my mind, here and now belongs to the world that was, but the world itself has already changed into something else. So far, the actual changes carried out in that process are limited in number. Most of the new world has been retained from the world I knew, which is why the changes have presented (virtually) no impediments to my daily life - so far. But the changes that have already taken place will almost certainly create other, greater, differences around me as time goes by. Those differences will expand little by little and will, in some cases, destroy the logicality of the actions I take. They could well cause me to commit errors that are - for me - literally fatal.Parallel worlds.","Most of the afternoons I would pass looking out at the pasture. I soon began seeing things. A figure emerging from the birch woods and running straight in my direction. Usually it was the Sheep Man, but sometimes it was the Rat, sometimes my girlfriend. Other times it was the sheep with the star on it\'s back.","Maybe the world was like a revolving door, it occurred to him as his consciousness was fading away.
