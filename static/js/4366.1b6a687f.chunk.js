It is so plain and so obvious and so simple. And yet, everybody rushes around in a great panic as if it were necessary to achieve something beyond themselves.","By replacing fear of the unknown with curiosity we open ourselves up to an infinite stream of possibility. We can let fear rule our lives or we can become childlike with curiosity, pushing our boundaries, leaping out of our comfort zones, and accepting what life puts before us.","This is the real secret of life -- to be completely engaged with what you are doing in the here and now. And instead of calling it work, realize it is play.","We are living in a culture entirely hypnotized by the illusion of time, in which the so-called present moment is felt as nothing but an infinitesimal hairline between a causative past and an absorbingly important future. We have no present. Our consciousness is almost completely preoccupied with memory and expectation. We do not realize that there never was, is, nor will be any other experience than present experience. We are therefore out of touch with reality.","Stop measuring days by degree of productivity and start experiencing them by degree of presence.","By going out of your mind, you come to your senses","Life is not a problem to be solved, but an experience to be had.","The future is a concept, it doesn\'t exist. There is no such thing as tomorrow. There never will be, because time is always now. That\'s one of the things we discover when we stop talking to ourselves and stop thinking. We find there is only present, only an eternal now.","People sometimes fail to live because they are always preparing to live.","You are the universe experiencing itself.","We must abandon completely the notion of blaming the past for any kind of situation we\'re in and reverse our thinking and see that the past always flows back from the present. That now is the creative point of life. So you see it\'s like the idea of forgiving somebody, you change the meaning of the past by doing that...Also, watch the flow of music. The melody as its expressed is changed by notes that come later. Just as the meaning of a sentence...you wait till later to find out what the sentence means...The present is always changing the past.","Problems that remain persistently insoluble should always be suspected as questions asked in the wrong way.","When a man no longer confuses himself with the definition of himself that others have given him, he is at once universal and unique.","No one imagines that a symphony is supposed to improve as it goes along, or that the whole object of playing is to reach the finale. The point of music is discovered in every moment of playing and listening to it. It is the same, I feel, with the greater part of our lives, and if we are unduly absorbed in improving them we may forget altogether to live them.","We see what we believe rather than what we see.","Everything in the world is gloriously meaningless.","All that you see out in front of you is how you feel inside your head.","For unless one is able to live fully in the present, the future is a hoax. There is no point whatever in making plans for a future which you will never be able to enjoy. When your plans mature, you will still be living for some other future beyond. You will never, never be able to sit back with full contentment and say, \\"Now, I\'ve arrived!\\" Your entire education has deprived you of this capacity because it was preparing you for the future, instead of showing you how to be alive now.","You, yourself, are the eternal energy which appears as this Universe. You didn\'t come into this world; you came out of it. Like a wave from the ocean.","A person who thinks all the time has nothing to think about except thoughts. So he loses touch with Reality, and lives in a world of illusion.","Enlightenment or awakening is not the creation of a new state of affairs but the recognition of what already is.","To go out of your mind at least once a day is tremendously important. By going out of your mind, you come to your senses.","The destination of life is this eternal moment.","Nothing is more creative than death, since it has the whole secret of life. It means that the past must be abandoned, that the unknown cannot be avoided, that \'I\' cannot continue, and that nothing can be ultimately fixed. When a man knows this, he lives for the first time in his life. By holding his breath, he loses it. By letting go he finds it.","You must not be afraid of playing wrong notes. Just forget it, play it wrong! But play!","How is it possible that a being with such sensitive jewels as the eyes, such enchanted musical instruments as the ears, and such a fabulous arabesque of nerves as the brain can experience itself as anything less than a god?  And, when you consider that this incalculably subtle organism is inseparable from the still more marvelous patterns of its environment - from the minutest electrical designs to the whole company of the galaxies - how is it conceivable that this incarnation of all eternity can be bored with being?","Do you see yourself as a victim of the world, or do you see yourself as the world?","Don\'t hurry anything. Don\'t worry about the future. Don\'t worry about what progress you\'re making. Just be entirely content to be aware of what is.","Yet again, the more you strive for some kind of perfection or mastery\u2014in morals, in art or in spirituality\u2014the more you see that you are playing a rarified and lofty form of the old ego-game, and that your attainment of any height is apparent to yourself and to others only by contrast with someone else\'s depth or failure.","Stay in the center, and you will be ready to move in any direction.","Of course, you can\u2019t force your mind to be silent. That would be like trying to smooth ripples in water with a flatiron. Water becomes clear and calm only when left alone.","Life is like music for its own sake. We are living in an eternal now, and when we listen to music we are not listening to the past, we are not listening to the future, we are listening to an expanded present.","We seldom realize, for example that our most private thoughts and emotions are not actually our own. For we think in terms of languages and images which we did not invent, but which were given to us by our society.","Man is a little germ that lives on an unimportant rock ball that revolves about a small star at the outskirts of an ordinary galaxy. ... I am absolutely amazed to discover myself on this rock ball rotating around a spherical fire. It\'s a very odd situation. And the more I look at things I cannot get rid of the feeling that existence is quite weird.","To have faith is to trust yourself to the water. When you swim you don\'t grab hold of the water, because if you do you will sink and drown. Instead you relax, and float.","The truth is revealed by removing things that stand in its light, an art not unlike sculpture, in which the artist creates, not by building, but by hacking away.","It is the seeker, who understands there is more than what meets the eye, who is not afraid and makes the choice to go into the unknown. The process of awaking has begun, the discovery is underway.","Insecurity is the result of trying to be secure.","Take a deep breath and tell us your deepest, darkest secret, so we can wipe our brow and know that we\'re not alone.","Real religion is the transformation of anxiety into laughter.","Through our eyes, the universe is perceiving itself. Through our ears, the universe is listening to its harmonies. We are the witnesses through which the universe becomes conscious of its glory, of its magnificence.","Your soul isn\'t in your body; your body is in your soul!","Many people never grow up. They stay all their lives with a passionate need for external authority and guidance, pretending not to trust their own judgment.","There is a deep, peaceful calm in the dawning of a new day.","The sound of the rain needs no translation.","Self-improvement is a dangerous form of vanity.","For when you see that the universe cannot be distinguished from how you act upon it, there is neither fate nor free will, self nor other. There is simply one all-inclusive Happening, in which your personal sensation of being alive occurs in just the same way as the river flowing and the stars shining far out in space. There is no question of submitting or accepting or going with it, for what happens in and as you is no different from what happens as it.","We cannot be more sensitive to pleasure without being more sensitive to pain.","As muddy water is best cleared by leaving it alone, it could be argued that those who sit quietly and do nothing are making one of the best possible contributions to a world in turmoil.","Life exists only at this very moment, and in this moment it is infinite and eternal, for the present moment is infinitely small; before we can measure it, it has gone, and yet it exists forever.","Better to have a short life that is full of what you like doing than a long life spent in a miserable way.","There is no formula for generating the authentic warmth of love. It cannot be copied.","The only way to make sense out of change is to plunge into it, move with it, and join the dance.","The meaning of life is just to be alive. It is so plain and so obvious and so simple.","Nirvana is where you are, provided you don\'t object to it.","It takes time for an acorn to turn into an oak, but the oak is already implied in the acorn.","If you are ready to wake up, you are going to wake up. If you\'re not you are going to stay pretending that you are just a poor little me.","When a man no longer confuses himself with the definition of himself that others have given him, he is at once universal and unique. He is universal by virtue of the inseparability of his organism from the cosmos. He is unique in that he is just this organism and not any stereotype of role, class, or identity assumed for the convenience of social communication.","Ego is a social institution with no physical reality. The ego is simply your symbol of yourself. Just as the word \u201cwater\u201d is a noise that symbolizes a certain liquid without being it, so too the idea of ego symbolizes the role you play, who you are, but it is not the same as your living organism.","We thought of life by analogy with a journey, a pilgrimage, which had a serious purpose at the end, and the thing was to get to that end, success or whatever it is, maybe heaven after you\u2019re dead. But we missed the point the whole way along. It was a musical thing and you were supposed to sing or to dance while the music was being played.","We do not \\"come into\\" this world; we come out of it, as leaves from a tree. As the ocean \\"waves,\\" the universe \\"peoples.\\" Every individual is an expression of the whole realm of nature, a unique action of the total universe.","Every explicit duality is an implicit unity.","Really, the fundamental, ultimate mystery -- the only thing you need to know to understand the deepest metaphysical secrets -- is this: that for every outside there is an inside and for every inside there is an outside, and although they are different, they go together.","What I am really saying is that you don\u2019t need to do anything, because if you see yourself in the correct way, you are all as much extraordinary phenomenon of nature as trees, clouds, the patterns in running water, the flickering of fire, the arrangement of the stars, and the form of a galaxy. You are all just like that, and there is nothing wrong with you at all.","Hurrying and delaying are alike ways of trying to resist the present.","They are enlightened who join in this play knowing it as play, for people suffer only because they take as serious what the gods made for fun.","Paradoxical as it may seem, the purposeful life has no content, no point. It hurries on and on, and misses everything. Not hurrying, the purposeless life misses nothing, for it is only when there is no goal and no rush that the human senses are fully open to receive the world.","Think about a piece of music - some great symphony - we don\'t expect it to get better as it develops, or that its whole purpose is to reach the final crescendo. The joy is found in listening to the music in each moment.","Man suffers only because he takes seriously what the gods made for fun.","You can make any human activity into meditation simply by being completely with it and doing it just to do it.","We get such a kick out of looking forward to pleasures and rushing ahead to meet them that we can\u2019t slow down enough to enjoy them when they come.","Basically, there is simply nothing to worry about, because you yourself are the eternal energy of the universe.","The only serious side-effect of  #\u200e marijuana  is that you might get arrested.","You are an aperture through which the universe is looking at and exploring itself.","The question is not what I should do in the future to get it, but rather, what am I presently doing that prevents me from realizing it right now?","The more a thing tends to be permanent, the more it tends to be lifeless.","What keeps us from happiness is our inability to fully inhabit the present","Never pretend to a love which you do not actually feel, for love is not ours to command.","The difference between a baby and adult is that a baby believes in everything while the adult doubts everything. Babies also only tell the truth until they learn what a lie is.","If we are unduly absorbed in improving our lives we may forget altogether to live them.","If you say that getting the money is the most important thing, you\'ll spend your life completely wasting your time. You\'ll be doing things you don\'t like doing in order to go on living, that is to go on doing thing you don\'t like doing, which is stupid.","Jesus Christ knew he was God. So wake up and find out eventually who you really are. In our culture, of course, they\u2019ll say you\u2019re crazy and you\u2019re blasphemous, and they\u2019ll either put you in jail or in a nut house (which is pretty much the same thing). However if you wake up in India and tell your friends and relations, \u2018My goodness, I\u2019ve just discovered that I\u2019m God,\u2019 they\u2019ll laugh and say, \u2018Oh, congratulations, at last you found out.","Faith is, above all, openness; an act of trust in the unknown.","The \'you\' who you think you are does not exist.","It\'s time to question a job or career move when it seems like most energy is devoted to making things appear other than what they really are.","Try to imagine what it will be like to go to sleep and never wake up... now try to imagine what it was like to wake up having never gone to sleep.","What would you like to do if money were no object? How would you really enjoy spending your life?","When you get free from certain fixed concepts of the way the world is, you find it is far more subtle, and far more miraculous, than you thought it was.","To go out of your mind once a day is tremendously important, because by going out of your mind you come to your senses. And if you stay in your mind all of the time, you are over rational, in other words you are like a very rigid bridge which because it has no give; no craziness in it, is going to be blown down by the first hurricane.","To the Taoist mentality, the aimless, empty life does not suggest anything depressing. On the contrary, it suggests the freedom of clouds and mountain streams, wandering nowhere, of flowers in impenetrable canyons, beautiful for no one to see, and of the ocean surf forever washing the sand, to no end.","The biggest ego trip is getting rid of your ego, and of course the joke of it all is that your ego does not exist.","Meditation is the discovery that the point of life is always arrived at in the immediate moment.","Buddha\'s doctrine: Man suffers because of his craving to possess and keep forever things which are essentially impermanent...this frustration of the desire to possess is the immediate cause of suffering.","The greater part of human activity is designed to make permanent those experiences and joys which are only lovable because they are changing.","Nothing satisfies an individual incapable of enjoyment.","A paradox is only a truth standing on its head to attract attention.","Muddy water is best cleared by leaving it alone.","When you look out of your eyes at nature happening out there...You\'re looking at you.","The real you is not a puppet that life pushes around, the real deep down you is the whole universe.","Time is a social institution and not a physical reality. There is no such thing as time in the natural world - the world of stars and waters, clouds, mountains and living organisms. There is such a thing as rhythm - rhythm of tides, rhythm of biological processes... There is rhythm and there is motion. Time is a way of measuring motion.","Enjoyment is an art and a skill for which we have little talent or energy... your entire education has has deprived you of this capacity because it was preparing you for the future, instead of showing you how to be alive now.","If you love a person, you say to that person, \\"Look, I love you, whatever that may be. I\'ve seen quite a bit of it and I know there\'s lots that I haven\'t seen, but still it\'s you and I want you to be what you want to be. And I won\'t be happy if I\'ve got you in a cage. You\'d be a bird without song.\\"","You can\'t live at all unless you can live fully now.","If the universe is meaningless, so is the statement that it is so. If this world is a vicious trap, so is its accuser, and the pot is calling the kettle black.","Just as true humor is laughter at oneself, true humanity is knowledge of oneself.","For the price of intelligence as we now know it is chronic anxiety, anxiety which appears to increase\u2014oddly enough\u2014to the very degree that human life is subjected to intelligent organization.","In a certain sense, Zen is feeling life instead of feeling something about life.","When we attempt to exercise power or control over someone else, we cannot avoid giving that person the very same power or control over us.","You and I are all as much continuous with the physical universe as a wave is continuous with the ocean.","A living body is not a fixed thing, but a flowing event, like a flame or a whirlpool.","Everything is perpetually becoming new.","Change is an illusion because we\'re always at the place where any future can take us.","When you feel that you are a lonely, put-upon, isolated little stranger confronting all this, you are under the influence of an illusory feeling, because the truth is quite the reverse. You are the whole works, all that there is, and always was, and always has been, and always will be.","It\'s so important to consider this question: What do I desire?","But the attitude of faith is to let go, and become open to truth, whatever it might turn out to be.","A myth is an image in terms of which we try to make sense of the world.","Running away from fear is fear; fighting pain is pain; trying to be brave is being scared","Once you\'ve learned to think you can\'t stop. And an enormous number of people devote their lives to keeping their minds busy and feel extremely uncomfortable with silence.","Real travel requires a maximum of unscheduled wandering, for there is no other way of discovering surprises and marvels, which, as I see it, is the only good reason for not staying at home.","If, then, my awareness of the past and future makes me less aware of the present, I must begin to wonder whether I am actually living in the real world.","The Greek word for sinning means to \u2018miss the point;\u2019 The point is eternal life which is here and now.","We have a strange anxiety in us; that if we don\'t interfere then it won\'t happen. Now that\'s the root of an enormous amount of trouble.","The wake doesn\'t drive the ship","The real reason why human life can be so utterly exasperating and frustrating is not because there are facts called death, pain, fear, or hunger. The madness of the thing is that when such facts are present, we circle, buzz, writhe, and whirl, trying to get the I out of the experience...\\nSanity, wholeness and integration lie in the realisation that we are not divided, that man and his present experience are one, and that no separate I or mind can be found .... [Life] is a dance, and when you are dancing, you are not intent on getting somewhere. The meaning and purpose of dancing is the dance.","If you insist on being determined by the past that\'s your game, but the fact of the matter is it all starts right now.","The fools standpoint is that all social institutions are games. He sees the whole world as game playing. That\'s why, when people take their games seriously and take on stern and pious expressions, the fool gets the giggles because he knows that it is all a game.","Omnipotence is not knowing how everything is done; it\'s just doing it.","We have allowed brain thinking to develop and dominate our lives.\\nAs a consequence, we are at war within ourselves.\\nThe brain desiring things which the body does not want, and the body desiring things which the brain does not allow; the brain giving directions which the body will not follow, and the body giving impulses which the brain cannot","In Hindu philosophy the whole creation is regarded as the Vishnu Lila, the play of Vishnu. Lila means dance or play. Also in Hindu philosophy, they call the world illusion; and in Latin the root of the word illusion is ludere, to play.","Increasingly, the world around us looks as if we hated it.","It is hard indeed to notice anything for which the languages available to us have no description.","Life and love generate effort, but effort will not generate them. Faith-in life, in other people, and in oneself-is the attitude of allowing the spontaneous to be spontaneous, in its own way and in its own time.","There is a peculiar contradiction in trying to be a member of a republic while believing that the universe is a monarchy.","A chest of gold coins or a fat wallet of bills is of no use \\nwhatsoever to a wrecked sailor alone on a raft.","The Godhead is never an object of its own knowledge. Just as a knife doesn\'t cut itself, fire doesn\'t burn itself, light doesn\'t illuminate itself. It\'s always an endless mystery to itself.","Zen is really extraordinarily simple as long as one doesn\'t try to be cute about it or beat around the bush! Zen is simply the sensation and the clear understanding ... that there is behind the multiplicity of events and creatures in this universe simply one energy -- and it appears as you, and everything is it. The practice of Zen is to understand that one energy so as to \\"feel it in your bones.","To understand music, you must listen to it. But so long as you are thinking, \u201cI am listening to this music,\u201d you are not listening.","Sexual love is a troubled and problematic relationship in cultures where there is a strong sense of man\'s separation from nature, especially when the realm of nature is felt to be inferior or contaminated with evil.","There is only this now. It does not come from anywhere; it is not going anywhere. It is not permanent, but it is not impermanent. Though moving, it is always still. When we try to catch it, it seems to run away, and yet it is always here and there is no escape from it. And when we turn around to find the self which knows this moment, we find that it has vanished like the past.","Where-so-ever beings exist throughout all galaxies, it doesn\'t make any difference - you are all of them....and when they come into being, that\'s you coming into being.","We are living in a culture entirely hypnotized by the illusion of time","What you do is what the whole universe is doing at the place you call \\"here and now,\\" and you are something the whole universe is doing in the same way that a wave is something that the whole ocean is doing... The real you is not a puppet which life pushes around. The real deep-down you is the whole universe.","How did you know you\'re alive, unless you\'d once been dead?","If a flower had a God it would not be a transcendental flower but a field.","This is what Zen means by being detached\u2014not being without emotion or feeling, but being one in whom feeling is not sticky or blocked, and through whom the experiences of the world pass like the reflections of birds flying over water.","You are a function of what the whole universe is doing in the same way that a wave is a function of what the whole ocean is doing.","Of what use is the universe? What is the practical application of a million galaxies? Yet just because it has no use, it has a use - which may sound like a paradox, but is not. What, for instance, is the use of playing music? If you play to make money, to outdo some other artist, to be a person of culture, or to improve your mind, you are not really playing - for your mind is not on the music. You don\'t swing. When you come to think of it, playing or listening to music is a pure luxury, an addiction, a waste of valuable time and money for nothing more than making elaborate patterns of sound.","We are the eyes of the cosmos. So that in a way, when you look deeply into somebody\'s eyes, you\'re looking deep into yourself, and the other person is looking deeply into the same self.","I have realized that the past and future are real illusions, that they exist in the present, which is what there is and all there is.","When we dance, the journey itself is the point, as when we play music the playing itself is the point. And exactly the same thing is true in meditation. Meditation is the discovery that the point of life is always arrived at in the immediate moment.","No one is more dangerously insane than one who is sane all the time: he is like a steel bridge without flexibility, and the order of his life is rigid and brittle.","But I\'ll tell you what hermits realize. If you go off into a far, far forest and get very quiet, you\'ll come to understand that you\'re connected with everything.","You have seen that the universe is at root a magical illusion and a fabulous game, and that there is no separate \\"you\\" to get something out of it, as if life were a bank to be robbed. The only real \\"you\\" is the one that comes and goes, manifests and withdraws itself eternally in and as every conscious being. For \\"you\\" is the universe looking at itself from billions of points of view, points that come and go so that the vision is forever new.","The trouble with many religions, accused of wishful thinking, is that they are not wishful enough. They show a deplorable lack of imagination.","this present moment never comes to be and it never ceases to be, it is simply our minds that construct the continuity of thoughts we call time. In the present moment is nirvana.","In Zen, poverty is voluntary, and considered not really as poverty so much as simplicity, freedom, unclutteredness.","And people get all fouled up because they want the world to have meaning as if it were words... As if you had a meaning, as if you were a mere word, as if you were something that could be looked up in a dictionary. You are meaning.","If you are afraid of death, be afraid. The point is to get with it, to let it take over - fear, ghosts, pains, transience, dissolution, and all. And then comes the hitherto unbelievable surprise; you don\'t die because you were never born. You had just forgotten who you are.","Courage is the goal of cowards.","Many people think that the Bible is the authentic word of God and they worship the Bible, making it an idol.","When we look for things there is nothing but mind, and when we look for mind there is nothing but things.","There\'s an interdependence between flowers and bees. Where there are no flowers there are no bees, and where there are no bees, there are no flowers. They are really one organism. And so in the same way, everything in nature depends on everything else.","The source of all light is in the eye.","I was talking to a Zen master the other day and he said, \\"You shall be my disciple.\\"I looked at him and said, \\"Who was Buddha\'s teacher?\\" He looked at me in a very odd way for a moment and then he burst into laughter and handed me a piece of clover.","One is a great deal less anxious if one feels perfectly free to be anxious, and the same may be said of guilt.","The mundane and the sacred are one and the same.","Without birth and death, and without the perpetual transmutation of all the forms of life, the world would be static, rhythm-less, undancing, mummified.","You can\'t get wet from the word \'water.\'","Billions of years ago, you were a big bang, but now you\'re a complicated human being. And then we cut ourselves off, and don\'t feel that we\'re still the big bang. But you are.","Make a spurious division of one process into two, forget that you have done it, and then puzzle for centuries as to how the two get together.","The point, which can hardly be repeated too often, is that differentiation is not separation. The head and the feet are different, but not separate, and though man is not connected to the universe by exactly the same physical relation as branch to tree or feet to head, he is nonetheless connected - and by physical relations of fascinating complexity.","Things are as they are. Looking out into it the universe at night, we make no comparisons between right and wrong stars, nor between well and badly arranged constellations.","The world is a marvelous system of wiggles.","The Highest to which people can attain is wonder; and if the prime phenomenon makes them wonder, let them be content; nothing higher can it give them, and nothing further should they seek for behind it; there is the limit.","Normally, we do not so much look at things as overlook them.","I owe my solitude to other people.","So many people of wealth understand much more about making and saving money than about using and enjoying it. They fail to live because they are always preparing to live.","But we must not suffer over the suffering.","Our view of reality is like a chart of the sea - the truer it is, the less likely we will become lost.","Belief, as I use the word here, is the insistence that the truth is what one would \\"lief\\" or wish it to be. The believer will open his mind to the truth on condition that it fits in with his preconceived ideas and wishes. Faith, on the other hand, is an unreserved opening of the mind to the truth, whatever it may turn out to be. Faith has no preconceptions; it is a plunge into the unknown. Belief clings, but faith lets go.","The Tao belongs neither to knowing nor not knowing. Knowing is false understanding; not knowing is blind ignorance. If you really understand the Tao beyond doubt, it\'s like the empty sky. Why drag in right and wrong?","Psychedelic experience is only a glimpse of genuine mystical insight, but a glimpse which can be matured and deepened by the various ways of meditation in which drugs are no longer necessary or useful. If you get the message, hang up the phone. For psychedelic drugs are simply instruments, like microscopes, telescopes, and telephones. The biologist does not sit with eye permanently glued to the microscope, he goes away and works on what he has seen.","A person who thinks too much only ever thinks about his thoughts","Irrevocable commitment to any religion is not only intellectual suicide; it is positive unfaith because it closes the mind to any new vision of the world. Faith is, above all, openness - an act of trust in the unknown.","You know that if you get in the water and have nothing to hold on to, but try to behave as you would on dry land, you will drown. But if, on the other hand, you trust yourself to the water and let go, you will float. And this is exactly the situation of faith.","Imagine a multidimensiona l spider\'s web in the early morning covered with dew drops. And every dew drop contains the reflection of all the other dew drops. And, in each reflected dew drop, the reflections of all the other dew drops in that reflection. And so ad infinitum. That is the Buddhist conception of the universe in an image.","If to enjoy even an enjoyable present we must have the assurance of a happy future, we are \u201ccrying for the moon.\u201d We have no such assurance. The best predictions are still matters of probability rather than certainty, and to the best of our knowledge every one of us is going to suffer and die. If, then, we cannot live happily without an assured future, we are certainly not adapted to living in a finite world where, despite the best plans, accidents will happen, and where death comes at the end.","The past and the future are abstractions without any concrete reality.","Conscious attention is a designed function of the brain \\n which scans the environment for any trouble making changes. \\n If you identify yourself with your trouble shooter, then naturally you define yourself as being in a perpetual state of anxiety.","Like too much alcohol,self-consciousness makes us see ourselves double, and we make the double image for two selves - mental and material, controlling and controlled, reflective and spontaneous. Thus instead of suffering we suffer about suffering, and suffer about suffering about suffering.","I am amazed that Congressmen can pass a bill imposing severe penalties on anyone who burns the American flag, whereas they are responsible for burning that for which the flag stands: the United States as a territory, as a people, and as a biological manifestation. That is an example of our perennial confusion of symbols with realities.","To define is to limit, to set boundaries, to compare and to contrast, and for this reason, the universe, the all, seems to defy definition....Just as no one in his senses would look for the morning news in a dictionary, no one should use speaking and thinking to find out what cannot be spoken or thought.","The power of memories and expectations is such that for most human beings, the past and the future are not as real, but rather more real than the present.","Anxiety is the fear that one of a pair of opposites might cancel the other. Forever.","Life and love generate effort but effort will not generate them.","What was it like to wake up after having never gone to sleep? That was when you were born.","The most strongly enforced of all known taboos is the taboo against knowing who or what you really are behind the mask of your apparently separate, independent, and isolated ego.","There is no mission, nor interest to convert, and yet I believe that if this state of consciousness could become more universal, the pretentious nonsense which passes for the serious business of the world would dissolve in laughter. We should see at once that the high ideals for which we are killing and regimenting each other are empty and abstract substiutes for the unheeded miracles that surround us - not only in the obvious wonders of nature but also in the overwhelming uncanny fact of mere existence.","Everybody should do in their lifetime, sometime, two things. One is to consider death...to observe skulls and skeletons and to wonder what it will be like to go to sleep and never wake up-never. That is a most gloomy thing for contemplation; it\'s like manure. Just as manure fertilizes the plants and so on, so the contemplation of death and the acceptance of death is very highly generative of creating life. You\'ll get wonderful things out of that.","The idea of the Universe being ruled by that marvelous old gentleman, is no longer plausible. It isn\'t that anybody has disproved it, but it just somehow doesn\'t go with the vast infinitude of the Universe.","Where do I begin and end in space? I have relations to the sun and air which are just as vital parts of my existence as my heart.","Substances like LSD, which give away a secret about the nature of the social game - the human game and what underlies it - are potentially dangerous, of course, like any good thing is. Electricity is dangerous, fire is dangerous, cars are dangerous, planes are dangerous, but not so dangerous as driving on the freeway. The only way to handle danger is to face it. If you start getting frightened of it, then you make it worse. Because you project onto it all kinds of bogeys and threats which don\'t exist in it at all.","And so when the essential idea of love is lost there comes talk of fidelity. Actually, the only possible basis for two beings, male and female, to relate to each other is to grant each other total freedom.","Faith is a state of openness or trust.","Here is the vicious circle: if you feel separate from your organic life, you feel driven to survive; survival -going on living- thus becomes a duty and also a drag because you are not fully with it; because it does not quite come up to expectations, you continue to hope that it will, to crave for more time, to feel driven all the more to go on.","It is interesting that Hindus, when they speak of the creation of the universe do not call it the work of God, they call it the play of God, the Vishnu lila, lila meaning play. And they look upon the whole manifestation of all the universes as a play, as a sport, as a kind of dance \u2014 lila perhaps being somewhat related to our word lilt","The reason we want to go on and on is because we live in an impoverished present.","Everybody is I, you all know you are you. And wheresoever\'s beings exist throughout all galaxies it doesn\'t any difference. You are all of them, and when they come into being that\'s you coming into being, you know that very well. Only you don\'t have to remember the past in the same way you don\'t have to think about how you work your thyroid gland. You don\'t have to know how to shine the sun, you just do it, like you breathe. Doesn\'t it really astonish you that you are this fantastically complex thing, and that you\'re doing all of this and you never had any education on how to do it.","I find that the sensation of myself as an ego inside a bag of skin is really a hallucination.","A living body is not a fixed thing but a flowing event, like a flame or a whirlpool: the shape alone is stable, for the substance is a stream of energy going in at one end and out at the other. We are particularly and temporarily identifiable wiggles in a stream that enters us in the form of light, heat, air, water, milk, bread, fruit, beer, beef Stroganoff, caviar, and pate de foie gras. It goes out as gas and excrement - and also as semen, babies, talk, politics, commerce, war, poetry, and music. And philosophy.","If we live, we live; if we die, we die; if we suffer, we suffer; if we are terrified, we are terrified. There is no problem about it.","At times almost all of us envy the animals. They suffer and die, but do not seem to make a \\"problem\\" of it.","In other words, a person who is fanatic in matters of religion, and clings to certain ideas about the nature of God and the universe, becomes a person who has no faith at all.","Wonder, and its expression in poetry and the arts, are among the most important things which seem to distinguish men from other animals, and intelligent and sensitive people from morons.","Inability to accept the mystic experience is more than an intellectual handicap. Lack of awareness of the basic unity of organism and environment is a serious and dangerous hallucination. For in a civilization equipped with immense technological power, the sense of alienation between man and nature leads to the use of technology in a hostile spirit\u2014-to the \u201cconquest\u201d of nature instead of intelligent co-operation with nature.","Zen is a liberation from time. For if we open our eyes and see clearly, it becomes obvious that there is no other time than this instant, and that the past and the future are abstractions without any concrete reality.","When your eyes are functioning well you don\'t see your eyes.  If your eyes are imperfect you see spots in front of them.  That  means there are some lesions in the retina or wherever, and because your eyes aren\'t working properly, you feel them.  In the same way, you don\'t hear your ears.  If you have a ringing in your ears it means there\'s something wrong with your ears.  Therefore, if you do feel yourself, there must be something wrong with you.  Whatever you have, the sensation of I is like spots in front of your eyes - it means something\'s wrong with your functioning.","Parts exist only for purposes of figuring and describing, and as we figure the world out we become confused if we do not remember this all the time.","Western religions are more concerned with behavior, doctrine, and belief than with any transformation of the way in which we are aware of ourselves and our world.","I seem to be a brief light that flashes but once in all the aeons of time a rare, complicated, and all-too-delicate organism on the fringe of biological evolution , where the wave of life bursts into individual, sparkling, and multicolored drops that gleam for a moment... only to vanish forever.","There is no coming toward it or going away from it; it is, and you are it.","The art of living... is neither careless drifting on the one hand nor fearful clinging to the past on the other. It consists in being sensitive to each moment, in regarding it as utterly new and unique, in having the mind open and wholly receptive.","Trying to define yourself is like trying to bite your own teeth.","Since opposed principles, or ideologies, are irreconcilable, wars fought over principle will be wars of mutual annihilation. But wars fought for simple greed will be far less destructive, because the aggressor will be careful not to destroy what he is fighting to capture. Reasonable - that is, human - men will always be capable of compromise, but men who have dehumanized themselves by becoming the blind worshipers of an idea or an ideal are fanatics whose devotion to abstractions makes them the enemies of life.","so, the whole idea, you see, is that everything\'s falling apart, so don\'t try and stop it. when you\'re falling off a precipice, it doesn\'t do you any good to hang onto a rock that\'s falling with you. see? but everything is doing that. and so, again, this is another case of our completely wasting our energy in trying to prevent the world from falling apart. don\'t do it. and then you\'ll be able to do something interesting with the free energy.","That\'s a waste of time. If you really understand Zen... you can use any book. You could use the Bible. You could use Alice in Wonderland. You could use the dictionary, because... the sound of the rain needs no translation.","You are that vast thing that you see far, far off with great telescopes.","Zen... does not confuse spirituality with thinking about God while one is peeling potatoes. Zen spirituality is just to peel the potatoes.","Everybody is fundamentally the ultimate reality.","If you want to stay in a state of illusion, stay in it. But you can always wake up.","The whole point of Zen is to suspend the rules we have superimposed on things and to see the world as it is","Duality is always secretly unity.","Faith...is letting go and trusting oneself to the unknown.","You don\'t look out there for God, something in the sky, you look in you.","All I\'m saying is that minerals are just a rudimentary form of consciousness whereas the other people are saying that consciousness is a complicated form of minerals.","We think that the world is limited and explained by its past. We tend to think that what happened in the past determines what is going to happen next, and we do not see that it is exactly the other way around! What is always the source of the world is the present; the past doesn\'t explain a thing. The past trails behind the present like the wake of a ship and eventually disappears.","We have somehow conned ourselves into the notion that this moment is ordinary. This now moment, in which I\'m talking and you\'re listening, is eternity.","We are all as much extraordinary phenomena of nature as trees, clouds, the patterns in running water, the flickering of fire, the arrangement of the stars and the form of a galaxy.","The real Zen of the old Chinese masters was wu-shih, or \\"no fuss.\\"","The harder we try to catch hold of the moment, to seize a pleasant sensation..., the more elusive it becomes... It is like trying to clutch water in one\'s hands - the harder one grips, the faster it slips through one\'s fingers.","The further and further we look out with our telescopes and the further and further we look in with our microscopes, the larger and larger and smaller and smaller the universe becomes in order to escape the investigation because we are the universe looking at itself.","And the more you become aware of the unknown self - if you become aware of it - the more you realize that it is inseparably connected with everything else that is.","If happiness always depends on something expected in the future, we are chasing a will-o\'-the-wisp that ever eludes our grasp, until the future, and ourselves, vanish into the abyss of death.","The Art of Being: A state of wholeness in which the mind functions freely and easily, without the sensation of a second mind or ego standing over it with a club.","The psychotherapist ... tries to help the individual to be himself and to go it alone without giving unnecessary offense to his community, to be in the world (of social convention) but not of the world.","We are at the moment looking at space as something to be entered by the tremendous thrust of a rocket because that is the attitude of attacking the unknown. And that causes us not to realize that we are already on the most magnificently equipped spaceship, which could hardly be improved upon. It has got a source of temperature and energy just at the right distance from it. It\'s beautifully equipped with oxygen, with food supplies, with all kinds of delightful things to do while on the journey.... and it\'s traveling through space at a colossal speed... and it\'s called the planet Earth.","Black implies white self implies other","We all need to go out of our minds at least once a day. \\n When we go out of our minds we quickly come to our senses.","A philosopher is a sort of intellectual yokel who gawks at things that sensible people take for granted.","One\'s life is an act with no actor, and thus it has always been recognized that the insane man that has lost his mind is a parody of the sage who has transcended his ego. If one is paranoid, the other is metanoid.","For there is never anything but the present, and if one cannot live there, one cannot live anywhere.","What we see as death, empty space, or nothingness is only the trough between the crests of this endlessly waving ocean. It is all part of the illusion that there should seem to be something to be gained in the future, and that there is an urgent necessity to go on and on until we get it. Yet just as there is no time but the present, and no one except the all-and-everything, there is never anything to be gained - though the zest of the game is to pretend that there is.","Everyone is the fabric and structure of existence.","And it came to pass that in the hands of the ignorant, the words of the Bible were used to beat plowshares into swords","No work or love will flourish out of guilt, fear, or hollowness of heart, just as no valid plans for the future can be made by those who have no capacity for living now.","Technology is destructive only in the hands of people who do not realize that they are one and the same process as the universe.","Hospitals should be arranged in such a way as to make being sick an interesting experience. One learns a great deal sometimes from being sick.","When one speaks of awakening, it means de-hypnotizatio n; coming to your senses. But of course to do that, you have to go out of your mind.","If we cling to belief in God, we cannot likewise have faith, since faith is not clinging but letting go.","For me, being literate and articulate is a form of judo, of overcoming the [system] by its own method.","The soul is something which contains the body. The body doesn\'t contain the soul. The soul, if we put it into modern language, is the entire complex of relationships in whose context this organism exists.","To remain stable is to refrain from trying to separate yourself from a pain because you know that you cannot. Running away from fear is fear, fighting pain is pain, trying to be brave is being scared. If the mind is in pain, the mind is pain. The thinker has no other form than his thought. There is no escape.","When death comes, it\'s just like winter. We don\'t say, \\"There ought not to be winter.\\" That the winter season, when the leaves fall and the snow comes, is some kind of defeat, something which we should hold out against. No. Winter is part of the natural course of events. No winter, no summer. No cold, no heat.","Spiritual awakening is the difficult process whereby the increasing realisation that everything is as wrong as it can be flips suddenly into the realisation that everything is as right is it can be. Or better, everything is as It as it can be.","We are not clear as to the role in life of these chemicals; nor are we clear as to the role of the physician. You know, of course, that in ancient times there was no clear distinction between priest and physician.","LSD is simply an exploratory instrument like a microscope or telescope, except this one is inside of you instead of outside of you.","For every individual is a unique manifestation of the Whole, as every branch is a particular outreaching of the tree. To manifest individuality, every branch must have a sensitive connection with the tree, just as our independently moving and differentiated fingers must have a sensitive connection with the whole body. The point, which can hardly be repeated too often, is that differentiation is not separation.","There is nothing at all that can be talked about adequately, and the whole art of poetry is to say what can\'t be said.","If you cannot trust yourself, you cannot even trust your mistrust of yourself - so that without this underlying trust in the whole system of nature you are simply paralyzed","But at any rate, the point is that God is what nobody admits to being, and everybody really is.","Zen is a way of liberation, concerned not with discovering what is good or bad or advantageous, but what is.","Tomorrow and plans for tomorrow can have no significance at all unless you are in full contact with the reality of the present, since it is in the present and only in the present that you live. There is no other reality than present reality, so that, even if one were to live for endless ages, to live for the future would be to miss the point everlastingly.","But the transformation of consciousness undertaken in Taoism and Zen is more like the correction of faulty perception or the curing of a disease. It is not an acquisitive process of learning more and more facts or greater and greater skills, but rather an unlearning of wrong habits and opinions. As Lao-tzu said, \\"The scholar gains every day, but the Taoist loses every day.","But nirvana is a radical transformation of how it feels to be alive: it feels as if everything were myself, or as if everything---including \\"my\\" thoughts and actions---were happening of itself. There are still efforts, choices, and decisions, but not the sense that \\"I make them\\"; they arise of themselves in relation to circumstances. This is therefore to feel life, not as an encounter between subject and object, but as a polarized field where the contest of opposites has become the play of opposites.","If we are not totally blind, what we are seeking is already here. This is it.","But when no risk is taken there is no freedom. It is thus that, in an industrial society, the plethora of laws made for our personal safety convert the land into a nursery, and policemen hired to protect us become selfserving busybodies.","The clash between science and religion has not shown that religion is false and science is true. It has shown that all systems of definition are relative to various purposes, and that none of them actually \u201cgrasp\u201d reality.","We live in a culture where it has been rubbed into us in every conceivable way that to die is a terrible thing. And that is a tremendous disease from which our culture in particular suffers.","We are sick with fascination for the useful tools of names and numbers, of symbols, signs, conceptions and ideas. Meditation is therefore the art of suspending verbal and symbolic thinking for a time, somewhat as a courteous audience will stop talking when a concert is about to begin.","Meditation is the way in which we come to feel our basic inseparability from the whole universe, and what that requires is that we shut up.","Nothing fails like success\u2014because the self-imposed task of our society and all its members is a contradiction: to force things to happen which are acceptable only when they happen without force.","The point is seeing that THIS - the immediate, everyday and present experience - is IT, the entire and ultimate point for the existence of a universe. I believe that if this state of consciousness could become more universal, the pretentious nonsense which passes for the serious business of the world would dissolve in laughter.","You can\'t make love without art.","Chaos is always losing, but never defeated","In life as well as in art Zen never wastes energy in stopping to explain; it only indicates.","The secret of the enjoyment of pleasure is to know when to stop. Man doesn\'t learn this secret easily, but to shun pleasure altogether is cowardly avoidance of a difficult job. For we have to learn the art of enjoying things BECAUSE they are impermanent.","I too realize that the less I preach the more likely I am to be heard.","But the disappearance of the effort to let go is precisely the disappearance of the separate thinker, of the ego trying to watch the mind without interfering.","We are seeing, then, that our experience is altogether momentary. From one point of view, each moment is so elusive and so brief that we cannot even think about it before it has gone. From another point of view, this moment is always here, since we know no other moment than the present moment. It is always dying, always becoming past more rapidly than imagination can conceive. Yet at the same time it is always being born, always new, emerging just as rapidly from that complete unknown we call the future. Thinking about it almost makes you breathless.","If my happiness at this moment consists largely in reviewing happy memories and expectations, I am but dimly aware of this present. I shall still be dimly aware of the present when the good things that I have been expecting come to pass. For I shall have formed a habit of looking behind and ahead, making it difficult for me to attend to the here and now. If, then , my awareness of the past and future makes me less aware of the present, I must begin to wonder whether I am actually living in the real world.","For the perfect accomplishment of any art, you must get this feeling of the eternal present into your bones - for it is the secret of proper timing. No rush. No dawdle. Just the sense of flowing with the course of events in the same way that you dance to music, neither trying to outpace it nor lagging behind. Hurrying and delaying are alike ways of trying to resist the present.","What we have forgotten is that thoughts and words are conventions, and that it is fatal to take conventions too seriously. A convention is a social convenience, as, for example, money ... but it is absurd to take money too seriously, to confuse it with real wealth ... In somewhat the same way, thoughts, ideas and words are \\"coins\\" for real things.","The Universe is the game of the self, which plays hide and seek forever and ever.","If you awaken from this illusion, and you understand that black implies white, self implies other, life implies death - or shall I say, death implies life - you can conceive yourself. Not conceive, but feel yourself, not as a stranger in the world, not as someone here on sufferance, on probation, not as something that has arrived here by fluke, but you can begin to feel your own existence as absolutely fundamental. What you are basically, deep, deep down, far, far in, is simply the fabric and structure of existence itself.","Every individual is a unique manifestation of the Whole, as every branch is a particular outreaching of the tree.","There is an ineffable mystery that underlies ourselves and the world. It is the darkness from which the light shines. When you recognize the integrity of the universe and that death is as certain as birth, then you can relax and accept that this is the way it is. There is nothing else to do.","No worthwhile life can be lived without risks, despite current American superstitions to the contrary.","If you belong to an in-group of good, or saved, or elite people, you can only know that you\u2019re in because someone else is out. You cannot live on the right side of the tracks without there being a wrong side of the tracks, so you ought to be grateful to the outside for having the privilege of being on the inside.","How is it possible that a being with such sensitive jewels as the eyes, such enchanted musical instruments as the ears, and such fabulous arabesque of nerves as the brain can experience itself anything less than a god.","To look at life without words is not to lose the ability to form words- to think, remember, and plan. To be silent is not to lose your tongue. On the contrary, it is only through silence that one can discover something new to talk about. One who talked incessantly, without stopping to look and listen, would repeat himself ad nauseam. It is the same with thinking, which is really silent talking. It is not, by itself, open to the discovery of anything new, for its only novelties are simply arrangements of old words and ideas.","There is no formula for generating the authentic warmth of love. It cannot be copied. You cannot talk yourself into it or rouse it by straining at the emotions or by dedicating yourself solemnly to the service of mankind. Everyone has love, but it can only come out when he is convinced of the impossibility and the frustration of trying to love himself. This conviction will not come through condemnations, through hating oneself, through calling self love bad names in the universe. It comes only in the awareness that one has no self to love.","To be alive spiritually man must have union with God and must be conscious of it. Apart from this union his religious life will be an empty drudgery, a mere imitation of true spirituality.","You\'re not something that\'s a result of the big bang. You\'re not something that is a sort of puppet on the end of the process. You are still the process. You are the big bang, the original force of the universe...","There was never a time when the world began, because it goes round and round like a circle, and there is no place on a circle where it begins. Look at my watch, which tells the time; it goes round, and so the world repeats itself again and again.","To be silent is not to lose your tongue. On the contrary, it is only through silence that one can discover something new to talk about. One who talked incessantly, without stopping to look and listen, would repeat himself ad nauseam.","There is no way of making a hedge grow like pruning it. There is no way of making sex interesting like repressing it.","Like love, the light or guidance of truth that influences us exists only in living form, not in principles or rules or expectations or advice, however widely circulated","The morning glory which blooms for an hour differs not at heart from a giant pine that lives for a thousand years.","The moralist is the person who tells people that they ought to be unselfish, when they still feel like egos, and his efforts are always and invariably futile.","Other people teach us who we are. Their attitudes to us are the mirror in which we learn to see ourselves, but the mirror is distorted. We are, perhaps, rather dimly aware of the immense power of our social enviornment.","The more we try to live in the world of words, the more we feel isolated and alone, the more all the joy and liveliness of things is exchanged for mere certainty and security. On the other hand, the more we are forced to admit that we actually live in the real world, the more we feel ignorant, uncertain, and insecure about everything.","Just as money is not real, consumable wealth, books are not life. To idolize scriptures is like eating paper currency.","So then, the relationship of self to other is the complete realization that loving yourself is impossible without loving everything defined as other than yourself.","Jesus was not the man he was as a result of making Jesus Christ his personal savior.","To play so as to be relaxed and refreshed for work is not to play, and no work is well and finely done unless it, too, is a form of play.","Every intelligent individual wants to know what makes him tick, and yet is at once fascinated and frustrated by the fact that oneself is the most difficult of all things to know.","We know that from time to time there arise among human beings people who seem to exude love as naturally as the sun gives out heat.","But to me nothing - the negative, the empty - is exceedingly powerful.","What is the next step, the practical application? \u2014I will answer that the absolutely vital thing is to consolidate your understanding, to become capable of enjoyment, of living in the present, and of the discipline which this involves. Without this you have nothing to give.","Our pleasures are not material pleasures, but symbols of pleasure \u2013 attractively packaged but inferior in content.","But, as Douglas E Harding has pointed out, we tend to think of this planet as a life-infested rock, which is as absurd as thinking of the human body as a cell infested skeleton. Surely all forms of life, including man, must be understood as \\"symptoms\\" of the earth, the solar system, and the galaxy in which case we cannot escape the conclusion that the galaxy is intelligent.","It is also in despair of being able to understand or make any productive contribution to the highly organised chaos of our politico-economic system that large numbers of people simply abandon political and social committments. They just let society be taken over by a pattern of organisation which is as self-proliferative as a weed, and whose ends and values are neither human nor instinctive but mechanical.","More and more we try to effect an adaptation to life by means of external gadgets, and attempt to solve our problems by conscious thinking rather than unconscious \'know-how\'. This is much less to our advantage than we like to suppose.","We do not \\"come into\\" this world; we come out of it, as leaves from a tree.","But we try to pretend, you see, that the external world exists altogether independently of us.","Lack of love for the vegetative, subtle, cthonic, pagan, and sexy aspect of the world means death.","This-the immediate, everyday, and present experience-is IT, the entire and ultimate point for the existence of a universe.","The animal tends to eat with his stomach, and the man with his brain. When the animal\'s stomach is full, he stops eating, but the man is never sure when to stop. When he has eaten as much as his belly can take, he still feels empty, he still feels an urge for further gratification.","Your world is all these elements. Of light and sound, of taste, smell, and touch, woven together in many dimensions on the fabulous loom of your brain. Your brain; the most complicated thing in the world, which you yourself grew...without even thinking about it.","If you can\'t meditate in a boiler room, you can\'t meditate.","Your body does not eliminate poisons by knowing their names. To try to control fear or depression or boredom by calling them names is to resort to superstition of trust in curses and invocations. It is so easy to see why this does not work. Obviously, we try to know, name, and define fear in order to make it \u201cobjective,\u201d that is, separate from \u201cI.","We are at war between consciousness and nature, between the desire for permanence and the fact of flux. It is ourself against ourselves.","What would you do if money was no object?","You will begin to realize that if you contemplate long enough on the leaf of the flower, that it involves the whole universe.","The hostile attitude of conquering nature ignores the basic interdependence of all things and events--that the world beyond the skin is actually an extension of our own bodies--and will end in destroying the very environment from which we emerge and upon which our whole life depends.","And the attitude of faith is the very opposite of clinging to belief, of holding on.","When you really understand that you are what you see and know, you do not run around the countryside thinking, \\"I am all this!\\" There is simply all this.","The best way to convince someone is by making him realize that what you speak came from his own mind.","The menu is not the meal.","Only words and conventions can isolate us from the entirely undefinable something which is everything.","The question \\"What shall we do about it?\\" is only asked by those who do not understand the problem. If a problem can be solved at all, to understand it and to know what to do about it are the same thing. On the other hand, doing something about a problem which you do not understand is like trying to clear away darkness by thrusting it aside with your hands. When light is brought, the darkness vanishes at once.","We feel that our actions are voluntary when they follow a decision and involuntary when they happen without decision. But if a decision itself were voluntary every decision would have to be preceded by a decision to decide - An infinite regression which fortunately does not occur. Oddly enough, if we had to decide to decide, we would not be free to decide","To know that you are God is another way of saying that you feel completely one with this universe.","So we down-to-earth, gutsy, tough, realistic, and practical types have just been squandering billions of dollars and unimaginable amounts of energy, nerve-work, and materials in whizzing off to the moon to discover, as astronomers knew before, that it was just a dreary slag heap.  This is the true, original and scientifically etymological meaning of being lunatics.  Crying for the moon.","The myths underlying our culture and underlying our common sense have not taught us to feel identical with the universe, but only parts of it, only in it, only confronting it - aliens.","I want ... to consort with people whose emotions are not ... cold and standoffish.","...[W]ords can be communicative only between those who share similar experiences.","I can only think seriously of trying to live up to an ideal, to improve myself, if I am split in two pieces. There must be a good \u201cI\u201d who is going to improve the bad \u201cme.\u201d \u201cI,\u201d who has the best intentions, will go to work on wayward \u201cme,\u201d and the tussle between the two will very much stress the difference between them. Consequently \u201cI\u201d will feel more separate than ever, and so merely increase the lonely and cut-off feelings which make \u201cme\u201d behave so badly.","We therefore work, not for the work\'s sake, but for money\u2014and money is supposed to get us what we really want in our hours of leisure and play. In the United States even poor people have lots of money compared with the wretched and skinny millions of India, Africa, and China, while our middle andupper classes (or should we say \\"income groups\\") are as prosperous as princes. Yet, by and large, they have but slight taste for pleasure. Money alone cannot buy pleasure, though it can help. For enjoyment is an art and a skill for which we have little talent or energy.","It is obvious that the only interesting people are interested people, and to be completely interested is to have forgotten about \\"I\\".","To feel that life is meaningless unless \u201cI\u201d can be permanent is like having fallen desperately in love with an inch.","The ego is nothing other than the focus of conscious attention.","...the materialism of modern civilization is paradoxically founded on a hatred of materiality, a goal-oriented desire to obliterate all natural limits through technology, imposing an abstract grid over nature.","Lack of awareness of the basic unity of organism and environment is a serious and dangerous hallucination.","Enlightenment remains unrealized so long as it is considered as a specific \\n state to be attained, and for which there are standards of success.","I would suggest that today, we know about as much concerning the human mind as we knew about the galaxy in 1300.","A less \'brainy-culture\' would learn to synchronise its body rhythms rather than its clocks.","To know that you are God is another way of saying that you feel completely with this universe. You feel profoundly rooted in it and connected with it. You feel, in other words, that the whole energy, which expresses itself in the galaxies, is intimate. It is not something to which you are a stranger, but it is that with which you, whatever it is, are intimately bound up. That in your seeing, your hearing, your talking, your thinking, your moving, you express that which it is that moves the sun and other stars.","You will never get to the irreducible definition of anything because you will never be able to explain why you want to explain, and so on. The system will gobble itself up.","As the fish doesn\'t know water, people are ignorant of space.  Consciousness is concerned only with changing and varying details; it ignores constants-especially constant backgrounds.  Thus only very exceptional people are aware of what is basic to everything.","The problem is to overcome the ingrained disbelief in the power of winning nature by love, in the gentle (ju) way (do) of turning with the skid, of controlling ourselves by cooperating with ourselves.","The hallucination of separateness prevents one from seeing that to cherish the ego is to cherish misery. We do not realize that our so-called love and concern for the individual is simply the other face of our own fear of death or rejection. In his exaggerated valuation of separate identity, the personal ego is sawing off the branch on which he is sitting, and then getting more and more anxious about the coming crash!","In looking out upon the world, we forget that the world is looking at itself.","...the habitual dualist\'s solution to the problem of dualism: to solve the dilemma by chopping off one of the horns.","For if you know what you want, and will be content with it, you can be trusted. But if you do not know, your desires are limitless and no one can tell how to deal with you. Nothing satisfies an individual incapable of enjoyment.","Buddhism has in it no idea of there being a moral law laid down by somekind of cosmic lawgiver.","Do you have any control over being conscious? Do you know how you will?","What are we saying when we say now, something is holy? That means you should take a different attitude to what you are doing than if you were, for example, doing it for kicks.","We tend to regard ourselves as puppets of the Past, driven along by something that is always behind us.","To the philosophers of India, however, Relativity is no new discovery, just as the concept of light years is no matter for astonishment to people used to thinking of time in millions of kalpas, (A kalpa is about 4,320,000 years). The fact that the wise men of India have not been concerned with technological applications of this knowledge arises from the circumstance that technology is but one of innumerable ways of applying it.","Truly great companies are built on ideals, not just deals.","You don\'t need to try to be God, you are! But if you try to be God it means you don\'t know you are.","If you study the writings of the mystics, you will always find things in them that appear to be paradoxes, as in Zen, particularly.","Thought is a means of concealing Truth.","The agnostic, the skeptic, is neurotic, but this does not imply a false philosophy; it implies the discovery of facts to which he does not know how to adapt himself. The intellectual who tries to escape from neurosis by escaping from the facts is merely acting on the principle that \u201cwhere ignorance is bliss, \u2018tis folly to be wise.","If we want justice for minorities and cooled wars with our natural enemies, whether human or non-human, we must first come to terms with the minority and the enemy in ourselves and in our own hearts, for the rascal is there as much as anywhere in the \\"external\\" world - -especially when you realize that the world outside your skin is as much yourself as the world inside.","We must be careful that the business we build does not become mere busyness.","You are something that the whole world is doing just as when the sea has waves on it.","Breathing is important in the practice of meditation because it is the faculty in us that is simultaneously voluntary and involuntary. You can feel that you are breathing, and equally you can feel that it is breathing you. So it is a sort of bridge between the voluntary world and the involuntary world \u2014 a place where they are one.","If the earth is man\'s extended body, to be loved and respected as one\'s own body, those who do no greening of themselves will hardly bring about the greening of America. The idea of \'greening\' involves color, flowering, freshness of spring, and, above all, respect for what is organic and vegetative as distinct from the mechanical and metallic.","For a decision-the freest of my actions just happens like hiccups inside me or like a bird singing outside me.","In reality there are no separate events. Life moves along like water, it\'s all connected to the source of the river is connected to the mouth and the ocean.","What the devil is the point of surviving, going on living, when it\'s a drag? But you see, that\'s what people do.","To perceive that form reveals the void, and to see that the void reveals form, is the secret for the overcoming of death. To the extent that one is unaware of space, one is unaware of one\'s own eternity \u2014 it\'s the same thing!","However much I may be impressed by the difference between a star and the dark space around it, I must not forget that I can see the two only in relation to each other, and that this relation is inseparable.","The life of Zen begins, therefore, in a disillusion with the pursuit of goals which do not really exist the good without the bad, the gratification of a self which is no more than an idea, and the morrow which never comes.","The reason we have poverty is that we have no imagination. There are a great many people accumulating what they think is vast wealth, but it\'s only money... they don\'t know how to enjoy it, because they have no imagination.","You can\'t have something without nothing.","A holy person is someone who is whole; who has, as it were, reconciled his opposites.","A priest once quoted to me the Roman saying that a religion is dead when the priests laugh at each other across the altar. I always laugh at the altar, be it Christian, Hindu, or Buddhist, because real religion is the transformation of anxiety into laughter.","What you are basically, deep, deep down, far, far in, is simply the fabric and structure of existence itself.","Altough we all realize that monotony is boring, almost every form of industrial work- banking, accounting, mass-producing, service- is monotonous, and most people are paid for simply putting up with monotony","The role of the Guru is to show the person that he already has what he is looking for.","Someone once described \u201cChristian Secularism\u201d as the assumption that there is nothing at all to life except a pilgrimage between the maternity ward and the crematorium, and that it is within that span that Christian concern must be exercised because that is all there is.","But at any rate, the point is that God is what nobody admits to being, and everybody really is. If you awaken from this illusion, and you understand that black implies white, self implies other, life implies death - or shall I say, death implies life - you can conceive yourself.","...mysticism and empiricism go together in opposition to scholasticism...they base themselves on the non-linear world of experience rather than the linear world of letters.","The difficulty for most of us in the modern world is that the old-fashioned idea of God has become incredible or implausible.","Inability to accept the mystic experience is more than an intellectual handicap.","For the world is an ever-elusive and ever-disappointing mirage only from the standpoint of someone standing aside from it\u2014as if it were quite other than himself\u2014and then trying to grasp it. But a third response is possible. Not withdrawal, not stewardship on the hypothesis of a future reward, but the fullest collaboration with the world as a harmonious system of contained conflicts\u2014based on the realization that the only real \\"I\\" is the whole endless process.","In known history, nobody has had such capacity for altering the universe than the people of the United States of America. And nobody has gone about it in such an aggressive way.","We suffer from a hallucination, from a false and distorted sensation of our own existence as living organisms. Most of us have the sensation that \\"I myself\\" is a seperate center of feeling and action, living inside and bounded by the physical body-a center which \\"confronts\\" an \\"external\\" world of people and things, making contact through the senses with a universe both alien and strange.","We usually don\'t look. We overlook.","Society is our extended mind and body.","So the bodhisattva saves all beings, not by preaching sermons to them, but by showing them that they are delivered, they are liberated, by the act of not being able to stop changing.","The meaning and purpose of dancing is the dance. Like music also, it is fulfilled in each moment of its course. You do not play a sonata in order to reach the final chord, and if the meaning of things were simply in ends, composers would write nothing but finales.","There are two specific objections to use of psychedelic drugs.First,use of these drugs may be dangerous.Howev er,every worth-while exploration is dangerous-climb ing mountains,testi ng aircraft,rocket ing into outer space,or collecting botanical specimens in jungles.But if you value knowledge & the actual delight of exploration more than mere duration of uneventful life,you are willing to take the risks.","The individual may be understood as one particular focal point at which the whole universe expresses itself - as an incarnation of the self, or of the Godhead, or whatever one may choose to call it.","The whole process of nature is an integrated process of immense complexity and it is really impossible to tell whether something that happens in it is good or bad. Because you never know what will be the consequences of the misfortune. Or, you never know what will be the consequences of good fortune.","We must see that consciousness is neither an isolated soul nor the mere function of a single nervous system, but of that totality of interrelated stars and galaxies which makes a nervous system possible.","The greater the scientist, the more he is impressed with his ignorance of reality, and the more he realizes that his laws and labels, descriptions and definitions, are the products of his own thought. They help him to use the world for purposes of his own devising rather than understand and explain it.","The Chinese word Li may therefore be understood as organic order, as distinct from mechanical or legal order, both of which go by the book. Li is the asymmetrical, nonrepetitive, and unregimented order which we find in the patterns of moving water, the form of trees and clouds, of frost crystals on the window, or the scattering of pebbles on beach sand.","To resist change, to try to cling to life, is therefore like holding your breath: if you persist you kill yourself.","There was a young man who said though, it seems that I know that I know, but what I would like to see is the I that knows me when I know that I know that I know.","The religious idea of God cannot do full duty for the metaphysical infinity.","The more we struggle for life as pleasure, the more we are actually killing what we love.","To remain caught up in ideas and words about Zen is, as the old masters say, to stink of Zen.","People become concerned with being more humble than other people.","You find out that the universe is a system that creeps up on itself and says \'Boo\' and then laughs at itself for jumping.","To put is still more plainly: the desire for security and the feeling of insecurity are the same thing. To hold your breath is to lose your breath. A society based on the quest for security is nothing but a breath-retention contest in which everyone is as taut as a drum and as purple as a beet.","If the human race develops an electronic nervous system, outside the bodies of individual people, thus giving us all one mind and one global body, this is almost precisely what has happened in the organization of cells which compose our own bodies. We have already done it. [...] If all this ends with the human race leaving no more trace of itself in the universe than a system of electronic patterns, why should that trouble us? For that is exactly what we are now!","Any systems approaching perfect self-control also approaches perfect self-frustration.","But my dear man, reality is only a Rorschach ink-blot, you know.","Sex is no longer a serious taboo. Teenagers sometimes know more about it than adults.","As a human being it is just my nature to enjoy and share philosophy. I do this in the same way that some birds are eagles and some doves, some flowers lilies and some roses.","Religion is not a department of life; it is something that enters into the whole of it.","It is a special kind of enlightenment to have this feeling that the usual, the way things normally are, is odduncanny and highly improbable. G.K.Chesterton once said that it is one thing to be amazed at gorgon or a griffin, creatures which do not exist; but it is quite another and much higher thing to be amazed at a rhinoceros or a giraffe, creatures which do exist and look as if they don\'t. This feeling of universal oddity includes a basic and intense wondering about the sense of things.","Although profoundly \\"inconsequential,\\" the Zen experience has consequences in the sense that it may be applied in any direction, to any conceivable human activity, and that wherever it is so applied it lends an unmistakable quality to the work.","Our educational system in its entirety does nothing to give us any kind of material competence. In other words, we don\'t learn how to cook, how to make clothes, how to build houses, how to make love, or to do any of the absolutely fundamental things of life.","There is nothing wrong with meditating just to meditate, in the same way that you listen to music just for the music. If you go to concerts to \\"get culture\\" or to improve your mind, you will sit there as deaf as a doorpost.","What we have to discover is that there is no safety, that seeking is painful, and that when we imagine that we have found it, we don\u2019t like it.","No one\'s mouth is big enough to utter the whole thing.","I have suggested that behind almost all myth lies the mono-plot of the game of hide-and-seek.","Here\'s an example: someone says, \\"Master, please hand me the knife,\\" and he hands them the knife, blade first. \\"Please give me the other end,\\" he says. And the master replies, \\"What would you do with the other end?\\" This is answering an everyday matter in terms of the metaphysical. When the question is, \\"Master, what is the fundamental principle of Buddhism?\\" Then he replies, \\"There is enough breeze in this fan to keep me cool.\\" That is answering the metaphysical in terms of the everyday, and that is, more or less, the principle zen works on. The mundane and the sacred are one and the same.","Increasingly, we\'re developing all kinds of systems for verifying reality by echoing it.","Buddhism ... is not a culture but a critique of culture, an enduring nonviolent revolution or \\"loyal opposition\\" to the culture in which it is involved.","The police have enough work to keep them busy regulating automobile traffic, preventing robberies and crimes of violence and helping lost children and little old ladies find their way home. As long as the police confine themselves to such activities they are respected friends of the public. But as soon as they begin inquiring into people\'s private morals, they become nothing more than armed clergymen.","Our normal sense of the person as a lonely island of consciousness, is a dramatic illusion based on theological imagery.","The hallucination of being a separate ego will not stand up to biological tests.","Naturally, for a person who finds his identity in something other than his full organism is less than half a man. He is cut off from complete participation in nature. Instead of being a body, he \'has\' a body. Instead of living and loving he \'has\' instincts for survival and copulation.","Where does my fist go when I open up my hand? Where does my lap go when I stand up?","So what is discord at one level of your being is harmony at another level.","Essentially Satori is a sudden experience, and it is often described as a \\"turning over\\" of the mind, just as a pair of scales will suddenly turn over when a sufficient amount of material has been poured into one pan to overbalance the weight in the other. Hence it is an experience which generally occurs after a long and concentrated effort to discover the meaning of Zen.","Philosophers, for example, often fail to recognize that their remarks about the universe apply also to themselves and their remarks. If the universe is meaningless, so is the statement that it is so.","What we need to realize is that there can be, shall we say, a movement, a stirring among people, which can be organically designed instead of politically designed.","To be free from convention is not to spurn it but not to be deceived by it.","The world is filled with love-play, from animal lust to sublime compassion.","Some believe all that parents, tutors, and kindred believe. They take their principles by inheritance, and defend them as they would their estates, because they are born heirs to them.","It seems to be the special peculiarity of human beings that they reflect: they think about thinking and know that they know. This, like other feedback systems, may lead to vicious circles and confusions if improperly managed, but self-awareness makes human experience resonant. It imparts that simultaneous \\"echo\\" to all that we think and feel as the box of a violin reverberates with the sound of the strings. It gives depth and volume to what would otherwise be shallow and flat.","Life and Reality are not things you can have for yourself unless you accord them to all others. They do not belong to particular persons any more than the sun, moon and stars.","You are the big bang, the original force of the universe, coming on as whoever you are.","I have no other self than the totality of the things of which I am aware.","The sound of the rain needs no translation. In music one doesn\'t make the end of the composition the point of the composition... Same way in dancing, you don\'t aim at one particular spot in the room... The whole point of dancing is the dance.","The myths underlying our culture and underlying our common sense have not taught us to feel identical with the universe, but only parts of it, only in it, only confronting it - aliens... within I don\'t know how many years, but in not too long a time, it\'s going to become basic common sense that you are not some alien being who confronts an external world that is not you, but that almost every intelligent person will have the feeling of being an activity of the entire universe.","People often say to me, \'I understand what you are talking about intellectually, but I don\'t really feel it, I don\'t realize it,\' and I am apt to reply, \'I wonder whether you do understand it intellectually, because if you did you would also feel it.\'","Just as the highest and the lowest notes are equally inaudible, so perhaps, is the greatest sense and the greatest nonsense equally unintelligible.","What are plants doing?  What are plants all about? They serve human beings by being decorative, but what is it from its own point of view?  It\'s using up air; it\'s using up energy. It\'s really not doing anything except being ornamental. And yet here\'s this whole vegetable world, cactus plants, trees, roses, tulips, and edible vegetables, like cabbages, celery, lettuce - they\'re all doing this dance.","For we have never actually understood the revolutionary sense beneath them \u2013 the incredible truth that what religion calls the vision of God is found in giving up any belief in the idea of God.","You can\'t figure out the Universe, especially if you\'re using figures to figure it.","Different Chinese philosophers, writing probably in 5-4 centuries B.C., presented some major ideas and a way of life that are nowadays known under the name of Taoism, the way of correspondence between man and the tendency or the course of natural world.","The mind\'s the standard of the man.","A scholar tries to learn something everyday; a student of Buddhism tries to unlearn something daily.","...the whole universe is through and through the playing of love in every shade of the word\'s use, from animal lust to divine charity.","Playing a violin is, after all, only scraping a cat\'s entrails with horsehair.","Cows scream louder than carrots.","When we dance, the journey itself is the point, as when we play music the playing itself is the point.","Religion is always falling apart.","I knew of a physicist at the University of Chicago who was rather crazy like some scientists, and the idea of the insolidity, the instability of the physical world impressed him so much that he used to go around in enormous padded slippers for fear he should fall through the floor.","The style of God venerated in church, mosque, and synagogue seems completely different from the style of the natural universe.","Now, you see, if you understand what I\'m saying, with your intelligence, and then take the next step and say \\"But I understood it now, but I didn\'t feel it.\\" Then, next I raise the question: Why do you want to feel it? You say: \\"I want something more\\", because that\'s again that spiritual greed. And you could only say that because you didn\'t understand it.","The world is in an extremely dangerous situation, and serious diseases often require the risk of a dangerous cure like the Pasteur serum for rabies.","Philosophy is man\u2019s expression of curiosity about everything and his attempt to make sense of the world primarily through his intellect.","The anitya doctrine is, again, not quite the simple assertion that the world is impermanent, but rather that the more one grasps at the world, the more it changes.","How could you say the best form of government is a republic if you think the universe is a monarchy?","Wars based on principle are far more destructive... the attacker will not destroy that which he is after.","We identify in our exerience a differentiation between what we do and what happens to us.","There is always something taboo, something repressed, unadmitted, or just glimpsed quickly out of the corner of one\'s eye because a direct look is too unsettling. Taboos lie within taboos, like the skin of an onion.","And although our bodies are bounded with skin, and we can differentiate between outside and inside, they cannot exist except in a certain kind of natural environment.","... preliminary accounting, banking and surveying (known as arithmetic, algebra and geometry).","Do not let the rapidity with which these thoughts can change deceive you into feeling that you think them all at once.","Everyone has love, but it can only come out when he is convinced of the impossibility and the frustration of trying to love himself.","The self-styled practical man of affairs who pooh-poohs philosophy as a lot of windy notions is himself a pragmatist or a positivist, and a bad one at that, since he has given no thought to his position.","Perhaps there is no other knowing than the mere competence of the act. If at the heart of one\'s being, there is no self to which one ought to be true, then sincerity is simply nerve; it lies in the unabashed vigor of the pretense. But pretense is only pretense when it is assumed that the act is not true to the agent. Find the agent.","These people, as far as I can see, do not congregate in the notorious centers of the movement, like the North Beach in San Francisco or Greenwich Village, or Venice, California.","Just as the ocean is waving so each one of us is a waving of the whole cosmos, the entire works, all there is.","...for thousands of years human history has been a magnificently futile conflict, a wonderfully staged panorama of triumphs and tragedies based on the resolute taboo against admitting that black goes with white.","That society is strong and viable which recognizes its own provisionality.","\\"It is essential to understand this point thoroughly: that the thing-in-itself, whether animal, vegetable, or mineral, is not only unknowable-it does not exist. This is important not only for sanity and peace of mind, but also for the most \\"practical\\" reasons of economics, politics, and technology.. This is not to say only that things exist in relation to one another, but that what we call \\"things\\" are no more than glimpses of a unified process. Certainly, this process has distinct features which catch our attention, but we must remember that distinction is not separation.\\"","... nets, grids, and other types of calculus.","The sense of wrong is simply failure to see where something fits into a pattern, to be confused as to the hierarchical level upon which an event belongs.","We accepted a definition of ourselves which confined the self to the source and to the limitations of conscious attention. This definition is miserably insufficient, for in fact we know how to grow brains and eyes, ears and fingers, hearts and bones, in just the same way that we know how to walk and breathe, talk and think - only we can\'t put it into words. Words are too slow and too clumsy for describing such things, and conscious attention is too narrow for keeping track of all their details.","The problem comes up because we ask the question in the wrong way. We supposed that solids were one thing and space quite another, or just nothing whatever. Then it appeared that space was no mere nothing, because solids couldn\'t do without it. But the mistake in the beginning was to think of solids and space as two different things, instead of as two aspects of the same thing. The point is that they are different but inseparable, like the front end and the rear end of a cat. Cut them apart, and the cat dies.","Total situations are, therefore, patterns in time as much as patterns in space.","Just what should a young man or woman know to be \'in the know\'? Is there, in other words, some inside information, some special taboo, some real lowdown on life and existence that most parents and teachers either don\'t know or won\'t tell?","Beyond positive and negative, what is Reality?","Self-knowledge leads to wonder, and wonder to curiosity and investigation, so that nothing interests people more than people, even if only one\'s own person.","...for since there is no real \'way\' to sartori, the way you are following makes very little difference.","For there is a growing apprehension that existence is a rat-race in a trap: living organisms, including people, are merely tubes which put things in at one end and let them out at the other, which which both keeps them doing it and in the long run wears them out. So to keep the farce going, the tubes find ways of making new tubes, which also put things in at one end and let them out at the other.","Advice? I don\u2019t have advice. Stop aspiring and start writing. If you\u2019re writing, you\u2019re a writer. Write like you\u2019re a goddamn death row inmate and the governor is out of the country and there\u2019s no chance for a pardon. Write like you\u2019re clinging to the edge of a cliff, white knuckles, on your last breath, and you\u2019ve got just one last thing to say, like you\u2019re a bird flying over us and you can see everything, and please, for God\u2019s sake, tell us something that will save us from ourselves. Take a deep breath and tell us your deepest, darkest secret, so we can wipe our brow and know that we\u2019re not alone. Write like you have a message from the king. Or don\u2019t. Who knows, maybe you\u2019re one of the lucky ones who doesn\u2019t have to.","We are living in a culture entirely hypnotized by the illusion of time, in which the so-called present moment is felt as nothing but an infintesimal hairline between an all-powerfully causative past and an absorbingly important future. We have no present. Our consciousness is almost completely preoccupied with memory and expectation. We do not realize that there never was, is, nor will be any other experience than present experience. We are therefore out of touch with reality. We confuse the world as talked about, described, and measured with the world which actually is. We are sick with a fascination for the useful tools of names and numbers, of symbols, signs, conceptions and ideas.","Things are as they are. Looking out into the universe at night, we make no comparisons between right and wrong stars, nor between well and badly arranged constellations.","It\'s like you took a bottle of ink and you threw it at a wall. Smash! And all that ink spread. And in the middle, it\'s dense, isn\'t it? And as it gets out on the edge, the little droplets get finer and finer and make more complicated patterns, see? So in the same way, there was a big bang at the beginning of things and it spread. And you and I, sitting here in this room, as complicated human beings, are way, way out on the fringe of that bang. We are the complicated little patterns on the end of it. Very interesting. But so we define ourselves as being only that. If you think that you are only inside your skin, you define yourself as one very complicated little curlique, way out on the edge of that explosion. Way out in space, and way out in time. Billions of years ago, you were a big bang, but now you\'re a complicated human being. And then we cut ourselves off, and don\'t feel that we\'re still the big bang. But you are. Depends how you define yourself. You are actually--if this is the way things started, if there was a big bang in the beginning-- you\'re not something that\'s a result of the big bang. You\'re not something that is a sort of puppet on the end of the process. You are still the process. You are the big bang, the original force of the universe, coming on as whoever you are. When I meet you, I see not just what you define yourself as--Mr so-and- so, Ms so-and-so, Mrs so-and-so--I see every one of you as the primordial energy of the universe coming on at me in this particular way. I know I\'m that, too. But we\'ve learned to define ourselves as separate from it.","Zen does not confuse spirituality with thinking about God while one is peeling potatoes. Zen spirituality is just to peel the potatoes.","Let\'s suppose that you were able every night to dream any dream that you wanted to dream. And that you could, for example, have the power within one night to dream 75 years of time. Or any length of time you wanted to have. And you would, naturally as you began on this adventure of dreams, you would fulfill all your wishes. You would have every kind of pleasure you could conceive. And after several nights of 75 years of total pleasure each, you would say \\"Well, that was pretty great.\\" But now let\'s have a surprise. Let\'s have a dream which isn\'t under control. Where something is gonna happen to me that I don\'t know what it\'s going to be. And you would dig that and come out of that and say \\"Wow, that was a close shave, wasn\'t it?\\" And then you would get more and more adventurous, and you would make further and further out gambles as to what you would dream. And finally, you would dream ... where you are now. You would dream the dream of living the life that you are actually living today.","We seldom realize, for example, that our most private thoughts and emotions are not actually our own. For we think in terms of languages and images which we did not invent, but which were given to us by our society. We copy emotional reactions from our parents, learning from them thatexcrement is supposed to have a disgusting smell and that vomiting is supposed to be an unpleasant sensation. The dread of death is also learned from their anxieties about sickness and from their attitudes to funerals and corpses. Our social environment has this power just because we do not exist apart from a society. Society is our extended mind and body. Yet the very society from which the individual is inseparable is using its whole irresistible force to persuade the individual that he is indeed separate! Society as we now know it is therefore playing a game with self-contradictory rules.","We could say that meditation doesn\'t have a reason or doesn\'t have a purpose. In this respect it\'s unlike almost all other things we do except perhaps making music and dancing. When we make music we don\'t do it in order to reach a certain point, such as the end of the composition. If that were the purpose of music then obviously the fastest players would be the best. Also, when we are dancing we are not aiming to arrive at a particular place on the floor as in a journey. When we dance, the journey itself is the point, as when we play music the playing itself is the point. And exactly the same thing is true in meditation. Meditation is the discovery that the point of life is always arrived at in the immediate moment.","This, then, is the human problem: there is a price to be paid for every increase in consciousness. We cannot be more sensitive to pleasure without being more sensitive to pain. By remembering the past we can plan for the future. But the ability to plan for the future is offset by the \\"ability\\" to dread pain and to fear of the unknown. Furthermore, the growth of an acute sense of the past and future gives us a corresponding dim sense of the present. In other words, we seem to reach a point where the advantages of being conscious are outweighed by its disadvantages, where extreme sensitivity makes us unadaptable.","For unless one is able to live fully in the present, the future is a hoax.There is no point whatever in making plans for a future which you willnever be able to enjoy. When your plans mature, you will still be livingfor some other future beyond. You will never, never be able to sit backwith full contentment and say, \\"Now, I\'ve arrived!\\" Your entireeducation has deprived you of this capacity because it was preparingyou for the future, instead of showing you how to be alive now.","You\'re under no obligation to be the same person you were 5 minutes ago.","I am what happens between the maternity ward and the Crematorium","For man seems to be unable to live without myth, without the belief that the routine and drudgery, the pain and fear of this life have some meaning and goal in the future. At once new myths come into being \u2013 political and economic myths with extravagant promises of the best of futures in the present world. These myths give the individual a certain sense of meaning by making him part of a vast social effort, in which he loses something of his own emptiness and loneliness. Yet the very violence of these political religions betrays the anxiety beneath them \u2013 for they are but men huddling together and shouting to give themselves courage in the dark.","The clash between science and religion has not shown that religion is false and science is true. It has shown that all systems of definition are relative to various purposes, and that none of them actually \u201cgrasp reality.\u201d","Just as true humor is laughter at oneself, true humanity is knowledgeof oneself.","Your body does not eliminate poisons by knowing their names. To try to control fear or depression or boredom by calling them names is to resort to superstition of trust in curses and invocations. It is so easy to see why this does not work. Obviously, we try to know, name, and define fear in order to make it \u201cobjective, that is, separate from \u201cI.\u201d","But you cannot understand life and its mysteries as long as you try to grasp it. Indeed, you cannot grasp it, just as you cannot walk off with a river in a bucket. If you try to capture running water in a bucket, it is clear that you do not understand it and that you will always be disappointed, for in the bucket the water does not run. To \u201chave running water you must let go of it and let it run.\u201d","Indeed, one of the highest pleasures is to be more or less unconscious of one\u2019s own existence, to be absorbed in interesting sights, sounds, places, and people. Conversely, one of the greatest pains is to be self-conscious, to feel unabsorbed and cut off from the community and the surrounding world.","This state of affairs is known technically as the \\"double-bind.\\" Aperson is put in a double-bind by a command or request which containsa concealed contradiction...This is a damned-if-you-do and damned-if-you-don\'tsituation which arises constantly in human (and especially family)relations...The social doublebind game can be phrased in several ways:The first rule of this game is that it is not a game.Everyone must play.You must love us.You must go on living.Be yourself, but play a consistent and acceptable role.Control yourself and be natural.Try to be sincere.Essentially, this game is a demand for spontaneous behavior of certainkinds. Living, loving, being natural or sincere\u2014all these arespontaneous forms of behavior: they happen \\"of themselves\\" likedigesting food or growing hair. As soon as they are forced they acquirethat unnatural, contrived, and phony atmosphere which everyonedeplores\u2014weak and scentless like forced flowers and tasteless likeforced fruit. Life and love generate effort, but effort will not generatethem. Faith\u2014in life, in other people, and in oneself\u2014is the attitude ofallowing the spontaneous to be spontaneous, in its own way and in itsown time.","You do not play a sonata in order to reach the final chord, and if the meanings of things were simply in ends, composers would write nothing but finales.","It\u2019s better to have a short life that is full of what you like doing, than a long life spent in a miserable way.","We must abandon completely the notion of blaming the past for any kind of situation we\'re in and reverse our thinking and see that the past always flows back form the present. That now is the creative point of life. So you see its like the idea of forgiving somebody, you change the meaning of the past by doing that...Also watch the flow of music. The melody as its expressed is changed by notes that come later. Just as the meaning of a sentence...you wait till later to find out what the sentence means...The present is always changing the past.","Peace can be made only by those who are peaceful, and love can be shown only by those who love. No work of love will flourish out of guilt, fear, or hollowness of heart, just as no valid plans for the future can be made by those who have no capacity for living now.","You have seen that the universe is at root amagical illusion and a fabulous game, and that there is no separate\\"you\\" to get something out of it, as if life were a bank to be robbed. Theonly real \\"you\\" is the one that comes and goes, manifests and withdrawsitself eternally in and as every conscious being. For \\"you\\" is theuniverse looking at itself from billions of points of view, points thatcome and go so that the vision is forever new.","Although the rhythm of the waves beats a kind of time, it is not clock or calendar time. It has no urgency. It happens to be timeless time. I know that I am listening to a rhythm which has been just the same for millions of years, and it takes me out of a world of relentlessly ticking clocks. Clocks for some reason or other always seem to be marching, and, as with armies, marching is never to anything but doom. But in the motion of waves there is no marching rhythm. It harmonizes with our very breathing. It does not count our days. Its pulse is not in the stingy spirit of measuring, of marking out how much still remains. It is the breathing of eternity, like the God Brahma of Indian mythology inhaling and exhaling, manifesting and dissolving the worlds, forever. As a mere conception this might sound appallingly monotonous, until you come to listen to the breaking and washing of waves.","Where there is to be creative action, it is quite beside the point to discuss what we should or should not do in order to be right or good. A mind that is single and sincere is not interested in being good, in conducting relations with other people so as to live up to a rule. Nor, on the other hand, is it interested in being free, in acting perversely just to prove its independence. Its interest is not in itself, but in the people and problems of which it is aware; these are \u201citself. It acts, not according to the rules, but according to the circumstances of the moment, and the \u201cwell\u201d it wishes to others is not security but liberty.\u201d","If happiness always depends on something expected in the future, we are chasing a will-o\u2019-the-wisp that ever eludes our grasp, until the future, and ourselves, vanish into the abyss of death.","If you get the message, hang up the phone. For psychedelic drugs are simply instruments, like microscopes, telescopes, and telephones. The biologist does not sit with eye permanently glued to the microscope, he goes away and works on what he has seen.","the future is a concept\u2014it doesn\u2019t exist\ufeff There is no such thing as tomorrow There never will be because time is always now. That\u2019s one of the things we discover when we stop talking to ourselves and stop thinking. We find there is only present, only an eternal now.","when somebody plays music, you listen. you just follow those sounds, and eventually you understand the music. the point can\'t be explained in words because music is not words, but after listening for a while, you understand the point of it, and that point is the music itself. in exactly the same way, you can listen to all experiences.","Suppressing the fear of death makes it all the stronger. The point is only to know, beyond any shadow of doubt, that \\"I\\" and all other \\"things\\" now present will vanish, until this knowledge compels you to release them - to know it now as surely as if you had just fallen off the rim of the Grand Canyon. Indeed you were kicked off the edge of a precipice when you were born, and it\'s no help to cling to the rocks falling with you. If you are afraid of death, be afraid. The point is to get with it, to let it take over - fear, ghosts, pains, transience, dissolution, and all. And then comes the hitherto unbelievable surprise; you don\'t die because you were never born. You had just forgotten who you are.","The morning glory which blooms for an hour differs not at heart from the giant pine, which lives for a thousand years.","Inability to accept the mystic experience is more than an intellectual handicap. Lack of awareness of the basic unity of organism and environment is a serious and dangerous hallucination. For in a civilization equipped with immense technological power, the sense of alienation between man and nature leads to the use of technology in a hostile spirit\u2014-to the \u201cconquest of nature instead of intelligent co-operation with nature.\u201d","Most of us assume as a matter of common sense that space is nothing, that it\'s not important and has no energy. But as a matter of fact, space is the basis of existence. How could you have stars without space? Stars shine out of space and something comes out of nothing just in the same way as when you listen, in an unprejudiced way, you hear all sounds coming out of silence. It is amazing. Silence is the origin of sound just as space is the origin of stars, and woman is the origin of man. If you listen and pay close attention to what is, you will discover that there is no past, no future, and no one listening. You cannot hear yourself listening. You live in the eternal now and you are that. It is rally extremely simple, and that is the way it is.","a man does not really begin to be alive until he has lost himself, until he has released the anxious grasp which he normally holds upon his life, his property, his reputation and position.","We know that from time to time, there arise among human beings, people who seem to exude love as naturally as the sun gives out heat.","There are, then, two ways of understanding an experience. The first is to compare it with the memories of other experiences, and so to name and define it. This is to interpret it in accordance with the dead and the past. The second is to be aware of it as it is, as when, in the intensity of joy, we forget past and future, let the present be all, and thus do not even stop to think, \u201cI am happy.","The art of meditation is a way of getting into touch with reality, and the reason for it is that most civilized people are out of touch with reality because they confuse the world as it with the world as they think about it and talk about it and describe it. For on the one hand there is the real world and on the other there is a whole system of symbols about that world which we have in our minds. These are very very useful symbols, all civilization depends on them, but like all good things they have their disadvantages, and the principle disadvantage of symbols is that we confuse them with reality, just as we confuse money with actual wealth.","You didn\'t come into this world. You came out of it, like a wave from the ocean. You are not a stranger here.","As it is, we are merely bolting our lives\u2014gulping down undigested experiences as fast as we can stuff them in\u2014because awareness of our own existence is so superficial and so narrow that nothing seems to us more boring than simple being. If I ask you what you did, saw, heard, smelled, touched and tasted yesterday, I am likely to get nothing more than the thin, sketchy outline of the few things that you noticed, and of those only what you thought worth remembering. Is it surprising that an existence so experienced seems so empty and bare that its hunger for an infinite future is insatiable? But suppose you could answer, \u201cIt would take me forever to tell you, and I am much too interested in what\u2019s happening now. How is it possible that a being with such sensitive jewels as the eyes, such enchanted musical instruments as the ears, and such a fabulous arabesque of nerves as the brain can experience itself as anything less than a god? And, when you consider that this incalculably subtle organism is inseparable from the still more marvelous patterns of its environment\u2014from the minutest electrical designs to the whole company of the galaxies\u2014how is it conceivable that this incarnation of all eternity can be bored with being?\u201d","For there is a growing apprehension that existence is a rat-race in a trap: living organisms, including people,are merely tubes which put things in at one end and let them out at the other, which both keeps them doing it and in the long run wears them out. So to keep the farce going, the tubes find ways of making newtubes, which also put things in at one end and let them out at the other. At the input end they even develop ganglia of nerves called brains, with eyes and ears, so that they can more easily scrounge around for things to swallow. As and when they get enough to eat, they use up their surplus energy by wiggling in complicated patterns, making all sorts of noises by blowing air in and out of the input hole, and gathering together in groups to fight with other groups. In time, the tubes grow such anabundance of attached appliances that they are hardly recognizable as mere tubes, and they manage to do this in a staggering variety of forms. There is a vague rule not to eat tubes of your own form, but in general there is serious competition as to who is going to be the top type of tube. All this seems marvelously futile, and yet, when you begin to think about it, it begins to be more marvelous than futile. Indeed, it seems extremely odd.","If you awaken from this illusion and you understand that black implies white, self implies other, life implies death (or shall I say death implies life?), you can feel yourself \u2013 not as a stranger in the world, not as something here on probation, not as something that has arrived here by fluke - but you can begin to feel your own existence as absolutely fundamental.","He who thinks that God is not comprehended, by him God is comprehended; but he who thinks that God is comprehended knows him not. God is unknown to those who know him, and is known to those who do not know him at all.","The centipede was happy, quite, Until a toad in fun Said, \u201cPray, which leg goes after which? This worked his mind to such a pitch, He lay distracted in a ditch, Considering how to run.\u201d","I have always been fascinated by the law of reversed effort. Sometimes I call it the \u201cbackwards law. When you try to stay on the surface of the water, you sink; but when you try to sink, you float. When you hold your breath, you lose it\u2014which immediately calls to mind an ancient and much neglected saying, \u201cWhosoever would save his soul shall lose it.\u201d","We have made a problem for ourselves by confusing the intelligible with the fixed. We think that making sense out of life is impossible unless the flow of events can somehow be fitted into a framework of rigid forms. To be meaningful, life must be understandable in terms of fixed ideas and laws, and these in turn must correspond to unchanging and eternal realities behind the shifting scene. But if this what \\"making sense out of life\\" means, we have set ourselves the impossible task of making fixity out of flux.","For every individual is a uniquemanifestation of the Whole, as every branch is a particular outreachingof the tree. To manifest individuality, every branch must have asensitive connection with the tree, just as our independently moving anddifferentiated fingers must have a sensitive connection with the wholebody. The point, which can hardly be repeated too often, is thatdifferentiation is not separation.","What we see as death,empty space, or nothingness is only the trough between the crests of thisendlessly waving ocean. It is all part of the illusion that there shouldseem to be something to be gained in the future, and that there is anurgent necessity to go on and on until we get it. Yet just as there is notime but the present, and no one except the all-and-everything, there isnever anything to be gained\u2014though the zest of the game is to pretendthat there is.","I have no other self than the totality of things of which I am aware.","Belief clings, but faith lets go.","Yet again, the more you strive for some kind of perfection or mastery\u2014inmorals, in art or in spirituality\u2014the more you see that you are playing ararified and lofty form of the old ego-game, and that your attainment ofany height is apparent to yourself and to others only by contrast withsomeone else\'s depth or failure.","To travel is to be alive, but to get somewhere is to be dead, for as our own proverb says, \u201cTo travel well is better than to arrive.","So if you really go the whole way and see how you feel at the prospect of vanishing forever. Have all your efforts, and all your achievements, and all your attainments turning into dust and nothingness. What is the feeling? What happens to you? That\'s what it\'s all going to come to. And for some reason or other, we are supposed to find this depressing. Do you see in a way, how that is saying: the most real state is the state of nothing? But if somebody is going to argue that the basic reality is nothingness. Where does all this come from? Obviously from nothingness. Once again you get how it looks behind your eyes. You see?So in this way, by seeing that nothingness is the fundamental reality, and you see it\'s your reality. Then how can anything contaminate you? All the idea of you being scared, and put out and worried, and so on, this is nothing, it\'s a dream. Because you\'re really nothing. But this is most incredible nothing. So cheer up! You see?The essence of your mind is intrinsically pure. Pure means clear, void.See? If you think of this idea of nothingness as mere blankness, and you hold onto this idea of blankness then kind of grizzly about it, you haven\'t understood it. Nothingness is really like the nothingness of space, which contains the whole universe. All the sun and the stars and the mountains, and rivers, and the good men and bad men, and the animals, and insects, and the whole bit. All are contained in void. So out of this void comes everything and You Are IT. What else could You BE?","Human desire tends to be insatiable.","Instant coffee, for example, is a well\u2013deserved punishment for being in a hurry to reach the future.","We are living in a culture entirely hypnotized by the illusion of time, in which the so-called present moment is felt as nothing but an infinitesimal hairline between an all-powerfully causative past and an absorbingly important future. We have no present. Our consciousness is almost completely preoccupied with memory and expectation. We do not realize that there never was, is, nor will be any other experience than present experience. We are therefore out of touch with reality. We confuse the world as talked about, described, and measured with the world which actually is. We are sick with a fascination for the useful tools of names and numbers, of symbols, signs, conceptions and ideas.","The startling truth is that our best efforts for civil rights, internationalpeace, population control, conservation of natural resources, andassistance to the starving of the earth\u2014urgent as they are\u2014will destroyrather than help if made in the present spirit. For, as things stand, wehave nothing to give. If our own riches and our own way of life are notenjoyed here, they will not be enjoyed anywhere else. Certainly theywill supply the immediate jolt of energy and hope that methedrine, andsimilar drugs, give in extreme fatigue. But peace can be made only bythose who are peaceful, and love can be shown only by those who love.No work of love will flourish out of guilt, fear, or hollowness of heart,just as no valid plans for the future can be made by those who have nocapacity for living now.","For unless one is able to live fully in the present, the future is a hoax. There is no point whatever in making plans for a future which you will never be able to enjoy. When your plans mature, you will still be living for some other future beyond. You will never, never be able to sit back with full contentment and say, \u201cNow, I\u2019ve arrived! Your entire education has deprived you of this capacity because it was preparing you for the future, instead of showing you how to be alive now.\u201d","To Taoism that which is absolutely still or absolutely perfect is absolutely dead, for without the possibility of growth and change there can be no Tao. In reality there is nothing in the universe which is completely perfect or completely still; it is only in the minds of men that such concepts exist.","Here\'s an example: someone says, \\"Master, please hand me the knife,\\" and he hands them the knife, blade first. \\"Please give me the other end,\\" he says. And the master replies, \\"What would you do with the other end?\\" This is answering an everyday matter in terms of the metaphysical.When the question is, \\"Master, what is the fundamental principle of Buddhism?\\" Then he replies, \\"There is enough breeze in this fan to keep me cool.\\" That is answering the metaphysical in terms of the everyday, and that is, more or less, the principle zen works on. The mundane and the sacred are one and the same.","When you find out that there was never anything in the dark side to be afraid of \u2026 Nothing is left but to love.","Nothing fails like success\u2014because the self-imposed task of oursociety and all its members is a contradiction: to force things to happenwhich are acceptable only when they happen without force.","We suffer from a hallucination, from a false and distorted sensation of our own existence as living organisms. Most of us have the sensation that \\"I myself\\" is a separate center of feeling and action, living inside and bounded by the physical body\u2014a center which \\"confronts\\" an \\"external\\" world of people and things, making contact through the senses with a universe both alien and strange. Everyday figures of speech reflect this illusion. \\"I came into this world.\\" \\"You must face reality.\\" \\"The conquest of nature.\\" This feeling of being lonely and very temporary visitors in the universe is in flat contradiction to everything known about man (and all other living organisms) in the sciences. We do not \\"come into\\" this world; we come out of it, as leaves from a tree. As the ocean \\"waves,\\" the universe \\"peoples.\\" Every individual is an expression of the whole realm of nature, a unique action of the total universe. This fact is rarely, if ever, experienced by most individuals. Even those who know it to be true in theory do not sense or feel it, but continue to be aware of themselves as isolated \\"egos\\" inside bags of skin.","Life exists only at this very moment, and in this moment it is infinite and eternal. For the present moment is infinitely small; before we can measure it, it has gone, and yet it persists for ever.","only doubtful truths need defense.","Look, here is a tree in the garden and every summer is produces apples, and we call it an apple tree because the tree \\"apples.\\" That\'s what it does. Alright, now here is a solar system inside a galaxy, and one of the peculiarities of this solar system is that at least on the planet earth, the thing peoples! In just the same way that an apple tree apples!","Genuine love comes from knowledge, not from a sense of duty or guilt.","Whether we like it or not, change comes, and the greater the resistance, the greater the pain. Buddhism perceives the beauty of change, for life is like music in this: if any note or phrase is held for longer than its appointed time, the melody is lost. Thus Buddhism may be summed up in two phrases: \u201cLet go! and \u201cWalk on!\u201d Drop the craving for self, for permanence, for particular circumstances, and go straight ahead with the movement of life.\u201d","The mystery of life is not a problem to be solved but a reality to be experienced.","We therefore work, notfor the work\'s sake, but for money\u2014and money is supposed to get uswhat we really want in our hours of leisure and play. In the UnitedStates even poor people have lots of money compared with the wretchedand skinny millions of India, Africa, and China, while our middle andupper classes (or should we say \\"income groups\\") are as prosperous asprinces. Yet, by and large, they have but slight taste for pleasure. Moneyalone cannot buy pleasure, though it can help.

We must here make a clear distinction between belief and faith, because, in general practice, belief has come to mean a state of mind which is almost the opposite of faith. Belief, as I use the word here, is the insistence that the truth is what one would \u201clief or wish it to be. The believer will open his mind to the truth on condition that it fits in with his preconceived ideas and wishes. Faith, on the other hand, is an unreserved opening of the mind to the truth, whatever it may turn out to be. Faith has no preconceptions; it is a plunge into the unknown. Belief clings, but faith lets go. In this sense of the word, faith is the essential virtue of science, and likewise of any religion that is not self-deception.\u201d","People can\'t be talked out of illusions. If a person believes that the earth is flat, you can\'t talk him out of that, he knows that it\'s flat. He\'ll go down to the window and see that its obvious, it looks flat. So the only way to convince him that it isn\'t is to say, \\"Well let\'s go and find the edge","The ego-self constantly pushes reality away. It constructs a future out of empty expectations and a past out of regretful memories.","As you make more and more powerful microscopic instruments, the universe has to get smaller and smaller in order to escape the investigation. Just as when the telescopes become more and more powerful, the galaxies have to recede in order to get away from the telescopes. Because what is happening in all these investigations is this: Through us and through our eyes and senses, the universe is looking at itself. And when you try to turn around to see your own head, what happens? It runs away. You can\'t get at it. This is the principle. Shankara explains it beautifully in his commentary on the Kenopanishad where he says \'That which is the Knower, the ground of all knowledge, is never itself an object of knowledge.\'[In this quote from 1973 Watts, remarkably, essentially anticipates the discovery (in the late 1990\'s) of the acceleration of the expansion of the universe.]","The true splendor of science is not so much that it names and classifies, records and predicts, but that it observes and desires to know the facts, whatever they may turn out to be. However much it may confuse facts with conventions, and reality with arbitrary divisions, in this openness and sincerity of mind it bears some resemblance to religion, understood in its other and deeper sense. The greater the scientist, the more he is impressed with his ignorance of reality, and the more he realizes that his laws and labels, descriptions and definitions, are the products of his own thought. They help him to use the world for purposes of his own devising rather than to understand and explain it. The more he analyzes the universe into infinitesimals, the more things he finds to classify, and the more he perceives the relativity of all classification. What he does not know seems to increase in geometric progression to what he knows. Steadily he approaches the point where what is unknown is not a mere blank space in a web of words but a window in the mind, a window whose name is not ignorance but wonder.","If we get rid of all wishful thinking and dubious metaphysical speculations, we can hardly doubt that \u2013 at a time not too distant \u2013 each one of us will simply cease to be. It won\u2019t be like going into darkness forever, for there will be neither darkness, nor time, nor sense of futility, nor anyone to feel anything about it. Try as best you can to imagine this, and keep at it. The universe will, supposedly, be going on as usual, but for each individual it will be as if it had never happened at all; and even that is saying too much, because there won\u2019t be anyone for whom it never happened. Make this prospect as real as possible: the one total certainty. You will be as if you had never existed, which was, however, the way you were before you did exist \u2013 and not only you but everything else. Nevertheless, with such an improbable past, here we are. We begin from nothing and end in nothing. You can say that again. Think it over and over, trying to conceive the fact of coming to never having existed. After a while you will begin to feel rather weird, as if this very apparent something that you are is at the same time nothing at all. Indeed, you seem to be rather firmly and certainly grounded in nothingness, much as your sight seems to emerge from that total blankness behind your eyes. The weird feeling goes with the fact that you are being introduced to a new common sense, a new logic, in which you are beginning to realize the identity of ku and shiki, void and form. All of a sudden it will strike you that this nothingness is the most potent, magical, basic, and reliable thing you ever thought of, and that the reason you can\u2019t form the slight idea of it is that it\u2019s yourself. But not the self you thought you were.","For there is no joy in continuity, in the perpetual. We desire it only because the present is empty. A person who is trying to eat money is always hungry. When someone says, \\"Time to stop now!\\" he is in a panic because he has had nothing to eat yet, and wants more and more time to go on eating money, ever hopeful of satisfaction around the corner. We do not really want continuity, but rather a present experience of total happiness. The thought of wanting such an experience to go on and on is a result of being self-conscious in the experience, and thus incompletely aware of it. So long as there is the feeling of an \\"I\\" having this experience, the moment is not all. Eternal life is realized when the last trace of difference between \\"I\\" and \\"now\\" has vanished - when there is just this \\"now\\" and nothing else.By contrast, hell or \\"everlasting damnation\\" is not the everlastingness of time going on forever, but of the unbroken circle, the continuity and frustration of going round and round in pursuit of something which can never be attained. Hell is the fatuity, the everlasting impossibility, of self-love, self-consciousness, and seld-possession. It is trying to see one\xb4s own eyes, hear one\xb4s own ears, and kiss one\xb4s own lips.","For if we open our eyes and see clearly, it becomes obvious that there is no other time than this instant, and that the past and the future are abstractions without any concrete reality.","So you see, if you become aware of the fact that you are all of your own body, and that thebeating of your heart is not just something that happens to you, but something you\'re doing,then you become aware also in the same moment and at the same time that you\'re not onlybeating your heart, but that you are shining the sun. Why? Because the process of yourbodily existence and its rhythms is a process, an energy system which is continuous with theshining of the sun, just like the East River, here, is a continuous energy system, and all thewaves in it are activities of the whole East River, and that\'s continuous with the AtlanticOcean, and that\'s all one energy system and finally the Atlantic ocean gets around to beingthe Pacific Ocean and the Indian Ocean, etc., and so all the waters of the Earth are acontinuous energy system. It isn\'t just that the East River is part of it. You can\'t draw anyline and say \'Look, this is where the East River ends and the rest of it begins,\' as if you canin the parts of an automobile, where you can say \'This is definitely part of the generator,here, and over here is a spark plug.\' There\'s not that kind of isolation between the elementsof nature.","Paradox as it may seem, we likewise find life meaningful only when we have seen that it is without purpose, and know the \u201cmystery of the universe only when we are convinced that we know nothing about it at all.\u201d","Man aspires to govern nature, but the more one studies ecology, themore absurd it seems to speak of any one feature of an organism, or ofan organism/environment field, as governing or ruling others.","Zen Buddhism is a way and a view of life which does not belong to any of the formal categories of modern Western thought. It is not religion or philosophy; it is not a psychology or a type of science. It is an example of what is known in India and China as a \u201cway of liberation, and is similar in this respect to Taoism, Vedanta, and Yoga. As will soon be obvious, a way of liberation can have no positive definition. It has to be suggested by saying what it is not, somewhat as a sculptor reveals an image by the act of removing pieces of stone from a block.\u201d","My death will be the disappearance of a particular pattern in the water.","I am basically an eternal existence momentarily and perhaps needlesslyterrified by one half of itself..","every individual is a unique manifestation of the Whole, as every branch is a particular outreaching of the tree.","life requires no future to complete itself nor explanation to justify itself.

Experience and experiencer become one experiencing, known and knower one knowing.","The system can be paralyzed in yet another way. Every feedback system needs a margin of \u201clag or error. If we try to make a thermostat absolutely accurate\u2013that is, if we bring the upper and lower limits of temperature very close together in an attempt to hold the temperature at a constant 70 degrees\u2013the whole system will break down. For to the extent that the upper and lower limits coincide, the signals for switching off and switching on will coincide! If 70 degrees is both the lower and upper limit the \u201cgo\u201d sign will also be the \u201cstop\u201d sign; \u201cyes\u201d will imply \u201cno\u201d and \u201cno\u201d will imply \u201cyes.\u201d Whereupon the mechanism will start \u201ctrembling,\u201d going on and off, on and off, until it shakes itself to pieces. The system is too sensitive and shows symptoms which are startlingly like human anxiety. For when a human being is so self-conscious, so self-controlled that he cannot let go of himself, he dithers or wobbles between opposites. This is precisely what is meant in Zen by going round and round on \u201cthe wheel of birth-and-death,\u201d for the Buddhist samsara is the prototype of all vicious circles. We saw that when the furnace responds too closely to the thermostat, it cannot go ahead without also trying to stop, or stop without also trying to go ahead. This is just what happens to the human being, to the mind, when the desire for certainty and security prompts identification between the mind and its own image of itself. It cannot let go of itself. It feels that it should not do what it is doing, and that it should do what it is not doing. It feels that it should not be what it is, and be what it isn\u2019t. Furthermore, the effort to remain always \u201cgood\u201d or \u201chappy\u201d is like trying to hold the thermostat to a constant 70 degrees by making the lower limit the same as the upper.\u201d","Money is a way of measuring wealth but is not wealth in itself. A chest of gold coins or a fat wallet of bills is of no use whatsoever to a wrecked sailor alone on a raft. He needs real wealth, in the form of a fishing rod, a compass, an outboard motor with gas, and a female companion. But this ingrained and archaic confusion of money with wealth is now the main reason we are not going ahead full tilt with the development of our technological genius for the production of more than adequate food, clothing, housing, and utilities for every person on earth.","A particularly significant example of brain against body, or measures against matter, is urban man\u2019s total slavery to clocks. A clock is a convenient device for arranging to meet a friend, or for helping people to do things together, although things of this kind happened long before they were invented. Clocks should not be smashed; they should simply be kept in their place. And they are very much out of place when we try to adapt our biological rhythms of eating, sleeping, evacuation, working, and relaxing to their uniform circular rotation. Our slavery to these mechanical drill masters has gone so far and our whole culture is so involved with it that reform is a forlorn hope; without them civilization would collapse entirely. A less brainy culture would learn to synchronize its body rhythms rather than its clocks.","The frightened mind that runs away from everyday terrors meets the seeking mind that wants a better world.","This is the inevitable disadvantage of studying Asian philosophy by the purely literary methods of Western scholarship, for words can be communicative only between those who share similar experiences.","Faith is a state of openness or trust.To have faith is like when you trust yourself to the water. You don\u2019t grab hold of the water when you swim, because if you do you will become stiff and tight in the water, and sink. You have to relax, and the attitude of faith is the very opposite of clinging, and holding on.In other words, a person who is fanatic in matters of religion, and clings to certain ideas about the nature of God and the universe becomes a person who has no faith at all. Instead they are holding tight. But the attitude of faith is to let go, and become open to truth, whatever it might turn out to be.","Problems that remain persistently insoluble should always be suspected as questions asked in the wrong way","If we are open only to discoveries which will accord with what we know already, we may as well stay shut.","Certainly the revolutionary thinker must go beyond thought. He knows that almost all his best ideas come to him when thinking has stopped. He may have struggled and struggled to understand a problem in terms of old ways of thinking, only to find it impossible. But when thought stops from exhaustion, the mind is open to see the problem as it is\u2014not as it is verbalized\u2014and at once it is understood.","When it comes down to it, government is simply an abandonment of responsibility on the assumption that there are people, other than ourselves, who really know how to manage things. But the government, run ostensibly for the good of the people, becomes a self-serving corporation. To keep things under control, it proliferates law of ever-increasing complexity and unintelligibility, and hinders productive work by demanding so much accounting on paper that the record of what has been done becomes more important than what has actually been done. [...] The Taoist moral is that people who mistrust themselves and one another are doomed.","As long as you do not know how to die and come to life again, you are but a sorry traveler on this dark earth.","To travel is to be alive, but to get somewhere is to be dead.","We do not dance to reach a certain point on the floor, but simply to dance. Energy itself, as William Blake said, is eternal delight\u2014and all life is to be lived in the spirit of rapt absorption in an arabesque of rhythms.","There is another story of a Chinese sage who was asked, \u201cHow shall we escape the heat?\u2014meaning, of course, the heat of suffering. He answered, \u201cGo right into the middle of the fire.\u201d \u201cBut how, then, shall we escape the scorching flame?\u201d \u201cNo further pain will trouble you!\u201d","For eternally and always there is only now, one and the same now; the present is the only thing that has no end.","To be free from convention is not to spurn it but not to be deceived by it. It is to be able to use it as an instrument instead of being used by it.","The more a person knows of himself, the more he will hesitate to define his nature and to assert what he must necessarily feel, and the more he will be astounded at his capacity to feel in unsuspected and unpredictable ways.","Lasting happiness\u2014the underlying quest in almost all of Watts\u2019s copious writing\u2014can only be achieved by giving up the ego-self, which is a pure illusion anyway. The ego-self constantly pushes reality away. It constructs a future out of empty expectations and a past out of regretful memories.","Reasonable\u2013that is, human\u2013men will always be capable of compromise, but men who have dehumanized themselves by becoming the blind worshipers of an idea or an ideal are fanatics whose devotion to abstractions makes them the enemies of life.","A mind that is single and sincere is not interested in being good, in conducting relations with other people so as to live up to a rule. Nor, on the other hand, is it interested in being free, in acting perversely just to prove its independence.","Much of the secret of life consists in knowing how to laugh, and also how to breathe.","The paradox about waking up\u2014I mean the ordinary kind of waking up that occurred to you and me this morning\u2014is that you can\u2019t make it happen, yet it\u2019s inevitable. The same holds true spiritually. You can\u2019t wish, pray, beg, force, or meditate yourself awake.","Just as true humour is laughter at oneself, true humanity is knowledge of oneself.","As Aristotle put it, the beginning of philosophy is wonder. I am simply amazed to find myself living on a ball of rock that swings around an immense spherical fire. I am more amazed that I am a maze\u2014a complex wiggliness, an arabesque of tubes, filaments, cells, fibers, and films that are various kinds of palpitation in this stream of liquid energy.","Trust in human nature is acceptance of the good-and-bad of it, and it is hard to trust those who do not admit their own weakness.","Herein lies the crux of the matter. To stand face to face with insecurity is still not to understand it. To understand it, you must not face it but be it.","Idolatry is not the use of images, but confusing them with what they represent, and in this respect mental images and lofty abstractions can be more insidious than bronze idols","who believe more firmly in the Devil than in God are always afraid that if they let go, the Devil will take over first, unaware that not having let go is the Devil already in full control.","This may be illustrated by the Taoist story of a farmer whose horse ran away. That evening the neighbors gathered to commiserate with him since this was such bad luck. He said, \u201cMay be. The next day the horse returned, but brought with it six wild horses, and the neighbors came exclaiming at his good fortune. He said, \u201cMay be.\u201d And then, the following day, his son tried to saddle and ride one of the wild horses, was thrown, and broke his leg. Again the neighbors came to offer their sympathy for the misfortune. He said, \u201cMay be.\u201d The day after that, conscription officers came to the village to seize young men for the army, but because of the broken leg the farmer\u2019s son was rejected. When the neighbors came in to say how fortunately everything had turned out, he said, \u201cMay be.\u201d14\u201d","If a man seeks the Buddha, that man loses the Buddha.","But spontaneity is not by any means a blind, disorderly urge, a mere power of caprice. A philosophy restricted to the alternatives of conventional language has no way of conceiving an intelligence which does not work according to plan, according to a one-at-a-time order of thought. Yet the concrete evidence of such an intelligence is right to hand in our own thoughtlessly ordered bodies. For the Tao does not \'know\' how it produces the universe just as we do not \'know\' how we construct our brains.","What is government? Government is the boot. The boot steps here and there, careful to avoid a blade of grass, to nurture it, coddle it, water it. The boot spots a snail heading toward its grass - slowly, surely. The boot smashes down on the snail and twists and laughs at its squelching noises, its last grasp for breath. The boot seeks a new snail - heading slowly toward the blade, sometimes simply minding its own business entirely - and smashes it too, like the first. The boot goes on and on - smashing, twisting, smashing, twisting - until finally it tires too of the blade of grass. The boot stops for only a moment and twists itself back down toward these carcasses lying about its yard. \'How sad,\' it says to itself, \'that some otherworldly spirit, possessing me, could do this!\' It goes to take a step, lets down onto the ground, and feels a dead snail. It instantly picks itself up, feeling proud - not that it will not stomp the snails in the future, but that it at least is starting to feel remorse for their deaths. It smashes the shells and bodies of hundreds of thousands of millions of snails, only to understand its weakness as originating from someplace else entirely; and then it has the audacity to smash even more.","When you are dying and coming to life in each moment, would-be scientific predictions about what will happen after death are of little consequence. The whole glory of it is that we do not know. Ideas of survival and annihilation are alike based on the past, on memories of waking and sleeping, and, in their different ways, the notions of everlasting continuity and everlasting nothingness are without meaning. It needs but slight imagination to realize that everlasting time is a monstrous nightmare, so that between heaven and hell as ordinarily understood there is little to choose.","It is in vain that we can predict and control the course of events in the future, unless we know how to live in the present. It is in vain that doctors prolong life if we spend the extra time being anxious to live still longer. It is in vain that engineers devise faster and easier means of travel if the new sights that we see are merely sorted and understood in terms of old prejudices. It is in vain that we get the power of the atom if we are just to continue in the rut of blowing people up.","tomorrow and plans for tomorrow can have no significance at all unless you are in full contact with the reality of the present, since it is in the present and only in the present that you live.","When life is empty, with respect to the past, and aimless, with respect to the future, the vacuum is filled by the present - normally reduced to a hairline, a split second in which there is no time for anything to happen.","In a relativistic universe you don\'t cling to anything, you learn to swim. And you know what swimming is - it\'s kind of a relaxed attitude with the water. In which you don\'t keep yourself afloat by holding the water, but by a certain giving to it.","Everything is change. Nothing can be held on to. And if you go with the flux, you flow with it. However, if you resist the stream, it fights you. If you realize this, you swim with the flow\u2014you go with it, and you\u2019re at peace. This is particularly true when it comes to those moments when life really seems to be taking us away, and the stream of change is going to swallow us completely. And so at the moment of death, we withdraw and say, \u201cNo, no, no! Not that! Not yet! But the whole problem is that we don\u2019t realize that the only thing to do when that moment comes is to go over the waterfall\u2014just as you go on from one day to the next, just as you go to sleep at night. When the moment comes, we should be absolutely willing to die.\u201d","Behind the mask of love I find my innate selfishness. What a predicament I am in if someone asks, \u201cDo you really love me? I can\u2019t say yes without saying no, for the only answer that will really satisfy is, \u201cYes, I love you so much I could eat you! My love for you is identical with my love for myself. I love you with the purest selfishness.\u201d No one wants to be loved out of a sense of duty. So I will be very frank. \u201cYes, I am pure, selfish desire and I love because you make me feel wonderful\u2014at any rate for the time being.\u201d But then I begin to wonder whether there isn\u2019t something a bit cunning in this frankness. It is big of me to be so sincere, to make a play for her by not pretending to be more than I am\u2014unlike the other guys who say they love her for herself. I see that there is always something insincere about trying to be sincere, as if I were to say openly, \u201cThe statement that I am now making is a lie.\u201d There seems to be something phony about every attempt to define myself, to be totally honest. The trouble is that I can\u2019t see the back, much less the inside, of my head. I can\u2019t be honest because I don\u2019t fully know what I am. Consciousness peers out from a center which it cannot see\u2014and that is the root of the matter.\u201d","Evil read backwards is \u201clive.\u201d Demon est deus inversus.\u201d","Part of man\'s frustration is that he has become accustomed to expect language and thought to offer explanations which they cannot give.","How long have the planets been circling the sun? Are they getting anywhere, and do they go faster and faster in order to arrive? How often has the spring returned to the earth? Does it come faster and fancier every year, to be sure to be better than last spring, and to hurry on its way to the spring that shall out-spring all springs?","To put it still more plainly: the desire for security and the feeling of insecurity are the same thing. To hold your breath is to lose your breath. A society based on the quest for security is nothing but a breath-retention contest in which everyone is as taut as a drum and as purple as a beet. We look for this security by fortifying and enclosing ourselves in innumerable ways. We want the protection of being \u201cexclusive and \u201cspecial,\u201d seeking to belong to the safest church, the best nation, the highest class, the right set, and the \u201cnice\u201d people. These defenses lead to divisions between us, and so to more insecurity demanding more defenses. Of course it is all done in the sincere belief that we are trying to do the right things and live in the best way; but this, too, is a contradiction.\u201d","[A] certain amount of \\"sitting just to sit\\" might well be the best thing in the world for the jittery minds and agitated bodies [...].","Imagine a multidimensional spider\'s web in the early morning covered with dew drops. And every dew drop contains the reflection of all the other dew drops. And, in each reflected dew drop, the reflections of all the other dew drops in that reflection. And so ad infinitum. That is the Buddhist conception of the universe in an image.","Self-knowledge leads to wonder, and wonder to curiosity and investigation, so that nothing interests people more than people, even if only one\u2019s own person. Every intelligent individual wants to know what makes him tick, and yet is at once fascinated and frustrated by the fact that oneself is the most difficult of all things to know. For the human organism is, apparently, the most complex of all organisms, and while one has the advantage of knowing one\u2019s own organism so intimately\u2014from the inside\u2014there is also the disadvantage of being so close to it that one can never quite get at it. Nothing so eludes conscious inspection as consciousness itself. This is why the root of consciousness has been called, paradoxically, the unconscious.","Self-consciousness is a stoppage because it is like interrupting a song after every note so as to listen to the echo, and then feeling irritated because of the loss of rhythm.","According to convention, I am not simply what I am doing now. I am also what I have done, and my conventionally edited version of my past is made to seem almost more the real \u201cme than what I am at this moment. For what I am seems so fleeting and intangible, but what I was is fixed and final. It is the firm basis for predictions of what I will be in the future, and so it comes about that I am more closely identified with what no longer exists than with what actually is!\u201d","Today we hear a lot of songs about love, and the mention of the big love thing on the way. You know what I would do? I would buy a gun and bar my door because I would know there is a storm of hypocrisy brewing.","Thus the \u201cbrainy economy designed to produce this happiness is a fantastic vicious circle which must either manufacture more and more pleasures or collapse\u2014providing a constant titillation of the ears, eyes, and nerve ends with incessant streams of almost inescapable noise and visual distractions. The perfect \u201csubject\u201d for the aims of this economy is the person who continuously itches his ears with the radio, preferably using the portable kind which can go with him at all hours and in all places. His eyes flit without rest from television screen, to newspaper, to magazine, keeping him in a sort of orgasm-with-out-release through a series of teasing glimpses of shiny automobiles, shiny female bodies, and other sensuous surfaces, interspersed with such restorers of sensitivity\u2014shock treatments\u2014as \u201chuman interest\u201d shots of criminals, mangled bodies, wrecked airplanes, prize fights, and burning buildings. The literature or discourse that goes along with this is similarly manufactured to tease without satisfaction, to replace every partial gratification with a new desire. For this stream of stimulants is designed to produce cravings for more and more of the same, though louder and faster, and these cravings drive us to do work which is of no interest save for the money it pays\u2014to buy more lavish radios, sleeker automobiles, glossier magazines, and better television sets, all of which will somehow conspire to persuade us that happiness lies just around the corner if we will buy one more.\u201d","In attachment there is pain, and in pain deliverance, so that at this point attachment itself offers no obstacle, and the liberated one is at last free to love with all his might and to suffer with all his heart. This is not because he has learned the trick of splitting himself into higher and lower selves so that he can watch himself with inward indifference, but rather because he has found the meeting-point of the limit of wisdom and the limit of foolishness. The Bodhisattva is the fool who has become wise by persisting in his folly.","the most basic Buddhist stance: sober examination of what lies before you, leaving aside all assumptions.","Once the mind has seen through all fear and all hope, it finds peace within itself, in a state of awareness beyond thought.","it is really impossible to appreciate what is meant by the Tao without becoming, in a rather special sense, stupid.","Lao-tzu, that master of the law of reversed effort, who declared that those who justify themselves do not convince, that to know truth one must get rid of knowledge, and that nothing is more powerful and creative than emptiness\u2014from which men shrink.","The answer to the problem of suffering is not away from the problem but in it. The inevitability of pain will not be met by deadening sensitivity but by increasing it, by exploring and feeling out the manner in which the natural organism itself wants to react and which its innate wisdom has provided.","But just exactly what is the \u201cgood to which we aspire through doing and eating things that are supposed to be good for us? This question is strictly taboo, for if it were seriously investigated the whole economy and social order would fall apart and have to be reorganized. It would be like the donkey finding out that the carrot dangled before him, to make him run, is hitched by a stick to his own collar.For the good to which we aspire exists only and always in the future. Because we cannot relate to the sensuous and material present we are most happy when good things are expected to happen, not when they are happening. We get such a kick out of looking forward to pleasures and rushing ahead to meet them that we can\u2019t slow down enough to enjoy them when they come. We are therefore a civilization which suffers from chronic disappointment\u2014a formidable swarm of spoiled children smashing their toys.\u201d","Human beings appear to be happy just so long as they have a future to which they can look forward\u2014whether it be a \u201cgood time tomorrow or an everlasting life beyond the grave.\u201d","Is it only when you\u2019re in love with another person that you see them as they really are? And in the ordinary way, when you\u2019re not in love, you see only a fragmented version of that being? Because when you\u2019re in love with someone, you do indeed see them as a divine being. And suppose that\u2019s what they are, truly. And your eyes have, by your beloved, been opened. If you should be so fortunate as to encounter this spiritual experience, it seems to me to be a total denial of life to refuse it.","The brain can only assume its proper behavior when consciousness is doing what it is designed for: not writhing and whirling to get out of present experience, but being effortlessly aware of it.","If you want to get the plain truth, Be not concerned with right and wrong. The conflict between right and wrong Is the sickness of the mind.1 a","[T]he joy of travel is not nearly so much in getting where one wants to go as in the unsought surprises which occur on the journey.","Among the educated young there is therefore a startling and unprecedented interest in the transformation of human consciousness. All over the Western world publishers are selling millions of books dealing with Yoga, Vedanta, Zen Buddhism, and the chemical mysticism of psychedelic drugs, and I have come to believe that the whole \u201chip subculture, however misguided in some of its manifestations, is the earnest and responsible effort of young people to correct the self\u2013destroying course of industrial civilization.\u201d","Forthe world is an ever-elusive and ever-disappointing mirage only fromthe standpoint of someone standing aside from it\u2014as if it were quiteother than himself\u2014and then trying to grasp it.But a third response is possible. Not withdrawal, not stewardship onthe hypothesis of a future reward, but the fullest collaboration with theworld as a harmonious system of contained conflicts\u2014based on therealization that the only real \\"I\\" is the whole endless process.","Discord on one level is harmony on another","There is simply no problem of life; it is absolutely purposeless play; it doesn\'t have to continue; there is no reason whatever to explain it, for explanations are just another form of complexity, a new manifestation of life on top of life, gestures gesturing. If there is any problem at all it is to find out how people come to think there is a problem, whatever made them imagine that life is serious. Basically there is the gesture. Time, space, multiplicity are all complications of it. Pain and suffering are very far-out forms of play, and there just isn\'t anything at all to be afraid of. There isn\'t any ego. The ego is a kind of flip, knowing that you know \u2014 like being afraid of being afraid. It\'s a curlicue, an extra jazz to things, a sort of double take or reverberation, a dithering of consciousness which is the same as anxiety.","For man seems to be unable to live without myth, without the belief that the routine and drudgery, the pain and fear of this life have some meaning and goal in the future. At once new myths come into being\u2014political and economic myths with extravagant promises of the best of futures in the present world. These myths give the individual a certain sense of meaning by making him part of a vast social effort, in which he loses something of his own emptiness and loneliness. Yet the very violence of these political religions betrays the anxiety beneath them\u2014for they are but men huddling together and shouting to give themselves courage in the dark.","The more we accustom ourselves to understanding the present in terms of memory, the unknown by the known, the living by the dead, the more desiccated and embalmed, the more joyless and frustrated life becomes. So protected from life, man becomes a sort of mollusc encrusted in a hard shell of \u201ctradition, so that when at last reality breaks through, as it must, the tide of pent-up fear runs wild.\u201d","Irrevocable commitment to any religion is not only intellectual suicide; it is positive unfaith because it closes the mind to any new vision of the world. Faith is, above all, open-ness\u2014an act of trust in the unknown. An ardent Jehovah\u2019s Witness once tried to convince me that if there were a God of love, he would certainly provide mankind with a reliable and infallible textbook for the guidance of conduct. I replied that no considerate God would destroy the human mind by making it so rigid and unadaptable as to depend upon one book, the Bible, for all the answers. For the use of words, and thus of a book, is to point beyond themselves to a world of life and experience that is not mere words or even ideas. Just as money is not real, consumable wealth, books are not life. To idolize scriptures is like eating paper currency.","All too easily, we confuse the world as we symbolize it with the world as it is. As semanticist Alfred Korzybski used to say, it is an urgent necessity to distinguish between the map and the territory and, he might have added, between the flag and the country.","We have untold stacks of recorded music from every age and culture, and the most superb means of playing it. But who actually listens? Maybe a few pot-smokers.","Life and love generate effort, but effort will not generate them.","There is, then, the feeling that we live in a time of unusual insecurity. In the past hundred years so many long-established traditions have broken down\u2014traditions of family and social life, of government, of the economic order, and of religious belief. As the years go by, there seem to be fewer and fewer rocks to which we can hold, fewer things which we can regard as absolutely right and true, and fixed for all time. To some this is a welcome release from the restraints of moral, social, and spiritual dogma. To others it is a dangerous and terrifying breach with reason and sanity, tending to plunge human life into hopeless chaos. To most, perhaps, the immediate sense of release has given a brief exhilaration, to be followed by the deepest anxiety. For if all is relative, if life is a torrent without form or goal in whose flood absolutely nothing save change itself can last, it seems to be something in which there is \u201cno future and thus no hope.\u201d","If we are to have intense pleasures, we must also be liable to intense pains.","The further truth that the undivided mind is aware of experience as a unity, of the world as itself, and that the whole nature of mind and awareness is to be one with what it knows, suggests a state that would usually be called love. For the love that expresses itself in creative action is something much more than an emotion. It is not something which you can \u201cfeel and \u201cknow,\u201d remember and define. Love is the organizing and unifying principle which makes the world a universe and the disintegrated mass a community. It is the very essence and character of mind, and becomes manifest in action when the mind is whole.\u201d","AT TIMES ALMOST ALL OF US ENVY THE ANIMALS. They suffer and die, but they do not seem to make a \u201cproblem of it. Their lives seem to have so few complications. They eat when they are hungry and sleep when they are tired, and instinct rather than anxiety seems to govern their few preparations for the future. As far as we can judge, every animal is so busy with what he is doing at the moment that it never enters his head to ask whether life has a meaning or a future. For the animal, happiness consists in enjoying life in the immediate present\u2014not in the assurance that there is a whole future of joys ahead of him. This\u201d","Nobody believes in God like an atheist: \u201cThere is no God, and I am His prophet.","We can\u2019t reimpose old myths on ourselves or believe in new ones made up out of a desire for comfort; therefore, the path of self-examination is the only one a person of conscience can reasonably follow.","Because all is lost, there is nothing to lose","There is simply experience. There is not something or someone experiencing experience! You do not feel feelings, think thoughts, or sense sensations any more than you hear hearing, see sight, or smell smelling. \u201cI feel fine means that a fine feeling is present.

There\u201d","But in reality we cannot compare joy with sorrow. Comparison is possible only by the very rapid alternation of two states of mind, and you cannot switch back and forth between the genuine feelings of joy and sorrow as you can shift your eyes between a cat and a dog. Sorrow can only be compared with the memory of joy, which is not at all the same thing as joy itself.","Now as you plumb out into the universe and explore it astronomically, it gets very strange. You begin to see things in the depths that at first sight seem utterly remote. How could they have anything to do with us. They are so far off and so unlikely. And in the same way, when you start probing into the inner workings of the human body you come across all kinds of funny little monsters and wiggly things that bear no resemblance to what we recognize as the human image. Look at a spermatozoon under a microscope. That little tadpole! And how can that have any connection with a grown human being. It\u2019s so unlike, you see. It\u2019s foreign feeling. And you get the creeps, a foreign feeling, about yourself...But what we will always find out in the end when we meet the very strange thing, there will one day be the dawning recognition: Why that\u2019s me.","Money alone cannot buy pleasure, though it can help. For enjoyment is an art and a skill for which we have little talent or energy.","How many of us now realize that space is the same thing as mind, or consciousness? That when you look out into infinity you are looking at yourself? That your inside goes with your entire outside as your front with your back? That this galaxy, and all other galaxies, are just as much you as your heart or your brain? That your coming and going, your waking and sleeping, your birth and your death, are exactly the same kind of rhythmic phenomena as the stars and their surrounding darkness?

So I can\u2019t get rid of you.\u201d","What is the next step, the practical application?\u2014I will answer that theabsolutely vital thing is to consolidate your understanding, to becomecapable of enjoyment, of living in the present, and of the disciplinewhich this involves. Without this you have nothing to give.","To put it still more plainly: the desire for security and the feeling of insecurity are the same thing. To hold your breath is to lose your breath. A society based on the quest for security is nothing but a breath-retention contest in which everyone is as taut as a drum and as purple as a beet. We look for this security by fortifying and enclosing ourselves in innumerable ways. We want the protection of being \u201cexclusive and \u201cspecial,\u201d seeking to belong to the safest church, the best nation, the highest class, the right set, and the \u201cnice\u201d people. These defenses lead to divisions between us, and so to more insecurity demanding more defenses. Of course it is all done in the sincere belief that we are trying to do the right things and live in the best way; but this, too, is a contradiction. I can only think seriously of trying to live up to an ideal, to improve myself, if I am split in two pieces. There must be a good \u201cI\u201d who is going to improve the bad \u201cme.\u201d \u201cI,\u201d who has the best intentions, will go to work on wayward \u201cme,\u201d and the tussle between the two will very much stress the difference between them. Consequently \u201cI\u201d will feel more separate than ever, and so merely increase the lonely and cut-off feelings which make \u201cme\u201d behave so badly.\u201d","Consciousness seems to be nature\'s ingenious mode of self-torture.","For the trouble with our rich and powerful people is not so much that they are wicked, but that they do not enjoy themselves.","When you look at the clouds they are not symmetrical. They do not form fours and they do not come along in cubes, but you know at once that they are not a mess. [...] They are wiggly but in a way, orderly, although it is difficult for us to describe that kind of order. Now, take a look at yourselves. You are all wiggly. [...] We are just like clouds, rocks and stars. Look at the way the stars are arranged.

Inwardly I am the tree.","The only way to make sense of change is to plunge into it, move with it, and join the dance.","There is, indeed, a viewpoint from which this \u201crationalization of life is not rational. The brain is clever enough to see the vicious circle which it has made for itself. But it can do nothing about it. Seeing that it is unreasonable to worry does not stop worrying; rather, you worry the more at being unreasonable.\u201d","Man when living is soft and tender; when dead he is hard and tough. All animals and plants are tender and fragile; when dead they become withered and dry. Therefore it is said: the hard and the tough are parts of death; the soft and tender are parts of life. This is the reason why the soldiers when they are too tough cannot carry the day; the tree when it is too tough will break. The position of the strong and great is low, and the position of the weak and tender is high.","we are convinced that sleep is a waste of valuable time and continue to chase these fantasies far into the night.","The knowledge of the past stays with us. To let go is simply to release any images and emotions.","Taoists do not look upon meditation as \'practice,\' except in the sense that a doctor \'practices\' medicine.

Moved by a zeal and reverence for facts, they have tried to see, understand, and face life as it is without wishful thinking. Yet for all that they have done to improve the conditions of life, their picture of the universe seems to leave the individual without ultimate hope. The price of their miracles in this world has been the disappearance of the world-to-come, and one is inclined to ask the old question, \u201cWhat shall it profit a man if he gain the whole world and lose his soul? Logic, intelligence, and reason are satisfied, but the heart goes hungry. For the heart has learned to feel that we live for the future. Science may, slowly and uncertainly, give us a better future\u2014for a few years. And then, for each of us, it will end. It will all end. However long postponed, everything composed must decompose.\u201d","All belief is fervent hope, and thus a cover-up for doubt and uncertainty.","Fictions are useful so long as they are taken as fictions.

The trisection of an angle is similarly an insoluble problem only for compass and straight-edge construction, and Achilles cannot overtake the tortoise so long as their progress is considered piecemeal, endlessly having the distance between them. However, as it is not Achilles but the method of measurement which fails to catch up with the tortoise, so it is not man but his method of thought which fails to find fulfillment in experience.","Actually, the world is not complex. It is the task of trying to figure it out with words or numbers that is complex.","[T]he art of life is more like navigation than warfare, for what is important is to understand the winds, the tides, the currents, the seasons, and the principles of growth and decay, so that one\'s actions may use them and not fight them.","you want to know what reality is, you must look directly at it and see for yourself. But this needs a certain kind of concentration, because reality is not symbols, it is not words and thoughts, it is not reflections and fantasies.

But the best pleasures are those for which we do not plan, and the worst part of pain is expecting it and trying to get away from it when it has come.\u201d","Belief, as I use the word here, is the insistence that the truth is what one would \u201clief or wish it to be. The believer will open his mind to the truth on condition that it fits in with his preconceived ideas and wishes. Faith, on the other hand, is an unreserved opening of the mind to the truth, whatever it may turn out to be. Faith has no preconceptions; it is a plunge into the unknown. Belief clings, but faith lets go.\u201d","As Chuang-tzu says, \u201cIt may be attained but not seen, or, in other words, felt but not conceived, intuited but not categorized, divined but not explained.

I shall still be dimly aware of the present when the good things that I have been expecting come to pass. For I shall have formed a habit of looking behind and ahead, making it difficult for me to attend to the here and now. If, then, my awareness of the past and future makes me less aware of the present, I must begin to wonder whether I am actually living in the real world.","it just happens, and all happenings are mutually interdependent in a way that seems unbelievably harmonious.","Every individual is an expression of the whole realm of nature, a unique action of the total universe.

But if decision itself were voluntary, every decision would have to be preceded by a decision to decide\u2013an infinite regression which fortunately does not occur. Oddly enough, if we had to decide to decide, we would not be free to decide. We are free to decide because decision \u201chappens. We just decide without having the faintest understanding of how we do it. In fact, it is neither voluntary nor involuntary. To \u201cget the feel\u201d of this relativity is to find another extraordinary transformation of our experience as a whole, which may be described in either of two ways. I feel that I am deciding everything that happens, or, I feel that everything, including my decisions, is just happening spontaneously. For a decision\u2013the freest of my actions-just happens like hiccups inside me or like a bird singing outside me. Such a way of seeing things is vividly described by a modern Zen master, the late Sokei-an Sasaki: One day I wiped out all the notions from my mind. I gave up all desire. I discarded all the words with which I thought and stayed in quietude. I felt a little queer\u2013as if I were being carried into something, or as if I were touching some power unknown to me\xa0\u2026\xa0and Ztt! I entered. I lost the boundary of my physical body. I had my skin, of course, but I felt I was standing in the center of the cosmos. I spoke, but my words had lost their meaning. I saw people coming towards me, but all were the same man. All were myself! I had never known this world. I had believed that I was created, but now I must change my opinion: I was never created; I was the cosmos; no individual Mr. Sasaki existed.7 It would seem, then, that to get rid of the subjective distinction between \u201cme\u201d and \u201cmy experience\u201d\u2013through seeing that my idea of myself is not myself\u2013is to discover the actual relationship between myself and the \u201coutside\u201d world. The individual, on the one hand, and the world, on the other, are simply the abstract limits or terms of a concrete reality which is \u201cbetween\u201d them, as the concrete coin is \u201cbetween\u201d the abstract, Euclidean surfaces of its two sides. Similarly, the reality of all \u201cinseparable opposites\u201d\u2013life and death, good and evil, pleasure and pain, gain and loss\u2013is that \u201cbetween\u201d for which we have no words.\u201d","Know yourself as Nothing. Feel yourself as Everything.","ALMOST EVERY FUNDAMENTAL PRINCIPLE OF LIFE can be expressed in two opposite ways. There are those who say that to attain the highest wisdom we must be still and calm, immovable in the midst of turmoil. And there are those who say that we must move on as life moves, never stopping for a moment either in fear of what is to come or to turn a regretful glance at what has gone. The former are as those who listen to music, letting the flow of notes pass through their minds without trying either to arrest them or to speed them on. Like Chuang-tzu\u2019s perfect man, they employ their minds as a mirror: it grasps nothing; it refuses nothing; it receives, but does not keep. The latter are as those who dance to music, keeping pace with its movement and letting their limbs flow with it as unceasingly and as unhesitatingly as clouds respond to the breath of wind. The one seems to reflect events as they pass, and the other to move forward with them. Both points of view, however, are true, for to attain that highest wisdom we must at once walk on and remain still. Consider life as a revolving wheel set upright with man walking on its tire. As he walks, the wheel is revolving toward him beneath his feet, and if he is not to be carried backward by it and flung to the ground he must walk at the same speed as the wheel turns. If he exceeds that speed, he will topple forward and slip off the wheel onto his face. For at every moment we stand, as it were, on the top of a wheel; immediately we try to cling to that moment, to that particular point of the wheel, it is no longer at the top and we are off our balance. Thus by not trying to seize the moment, we keep it, for the second we fail to walk on we cease to remain still. Yet within this there is a still deeper truth. From the standpoint of eternity we never can and never do leave the top of the wheel, for if a circle is set in infinite space it has neither top nor bottom. Wherever you stand is the top, and it revolves only because you are pushing it round with your own feet.","read omnivorously","We suffer from the delusion that the entire universe is held in order by the categories of human thought, fearing that if we do not hold to them with the utmost tenacity, everything will vanish into chaos.

I would rather follow the Turkish proverb that \\"he who sleeps on the floor will not fall out of bed.\\" In sum, I despise all furniture as monstrous, heavy, space-greedy, expensive, and pretentious.","Logic, intelligence, and reason are satisfied, but the heart goes hungry.","It seems that if I am afraid, then I am \u201cstuck with fear.

Yet you soon discover that you are able to go ahead with ordinary activities\u2014to work and make decisions as ever, though somehow this is less of a drag. Your body is no longer a corpse which the ego has to animate and lug around. There is a feeling of the ground holding you up, and of hills lifting you when you climb them. Air breathes itself in and out of your lungs, and instead, of looking and listening, light and sound come to you on their own. Eyes see and ears hear as wind blows and water flows. All space becomes your mind. Time carries you along like a river, but never flows out of the present: the more it goes, the more it stays, and you no longer have to fight or kill it.","I have always thought that all philosophical debates are ultimately between the partisans of structure and the partisans of \\"goo.","As soon as we freed ourselves from the mirage of hurrying time\u2014which was nothing more than the projection of our own impatience\u2014we were alive again, as in childhood, to the miracles and ecstasies of ordinary life.

The ego is simply your symbol of yourself.

The only way to make sense out of change is to plunge into it, move with it, and join the dance.\u201d","The morality thatgoes with this understanding is, above all, the frank recognition of yourdependence upon enemies, underlings, out-groups, and, indeed, upon allother forms of life whatsoever.

Without this assurance, he can be extremely miserable in the midst of immediate physical pleasure.","To be detached from the world, (in the sense that Buddhist and Taoists and Hindus often talk about detachment), does not mean to be non-participative. By that I don\'t mean that you just go through doing everything mechanically and have your thoughts elsewhere. I mean a complete participation, but still detached.And the difference between the two attitudes is this..On the one hand, there is a way of being so anxious about physical pleasure, so afraid that you won\'t make it, that you grab it too hard..that you just have to have that thing, and if you do that, you destroy it completely.. and therefore after every attempt to get it, you feel disappointed, you feel empty, you feel something was lost..and so you want it again, you have to keep repeating, repeating, repeating, repeating..because you never really got that. And it is this that\'s the hang up, this is what is meant by attachment to this world...But on the other hand, pleasure in its fullness cannot be experienced, when one is grasping it.. I knew a little girl to whom someone gave a bunny rabbit. She was so delighted with the bunny rabbit and so afraid of losing it, that taking it home in the car, she squeezed it to death with love. And lots of parents do that to their children. And lots of spouses do it to each other. They hold on too hard, and so take the life out of this transient, beautifully fragile thing that life is.To have it, to have life, and to have its pleasure, you must at the same time let go of it.","We are seeing, then, that our experience is altogether momentary. From one point of view, each moment is so elusive and so brief that we cannot even think about it before it has gone. From another point of view, this moment is always here, since we know no other moment than the present moment. It is always dying, always becoming past more rapidly than imagination can conceive. Yet at the same time it is always being born, always new, emerging just as rapidly from that complete unknown which we call the future. Thinking about it almost makes you breathless.","Egg is ego, and bird is the liberated Self.","[T]he anxiety-laden problem of what will happen to me when I die is, after all, like asking what happens to my fist when I open my hand, or where my lap goes when I stand up.","Perhaps the most exasperating thing about \u201cme, about nature and the universe, is that it will never \u201cstay put.\u201d It is like a beautiful woman who will never be caught, and whose very flightiness is her charm. For the perishability and changefulness of the world is part and parcel of its liveliness and loveliness.\u201d","This kind of living in the fantasy of expectation rather than the reality of the present is the special trouble of those business men who live entirely to make money. So many people of wealth understand much more about making and saving money than about using and enjoying it. They fail to live because they are always preparing to live. Instead of earning a living they are mostly earning an earning, and thus when the time comes to relax they are unable to do so.

Nearly twenty-five centuries ago, the Chinese sages Lao-tzu and Chuang-tzu had called it wu-wei, which is perhaps best translated as \u201caction without forcing. It is sailing in the stream of the Tao, or course of nature, and navigating the currents of li (organic pattern)\u2014a word that originally signified the natural markings in jade or the grain in wood.

I can not get rid of this desire since it is one and the same desire as the desire to get rid of it.","Working rightly, the brain is the highest form of \\"instinctual wisdom.\\" Thus it should work like the homing instinct of pigeons and the formation of the foetus in the womb - without verbalizing the process of knowing \\"how\\" it does it. The self-conscious brain, like the self-conscious heart, is a disorder, and manifests itself in the acute feeling of separation between \\"I\\" and my experience.","does the root of a flower influence the flower as something fundamentally different from it? No, surely the root and the flower are one process, and like your head and your feet it all goes together. In that sense then, the universe, and what you or I do, all goes together, and so that picture of the universe is really a picture of you.","God likes to play hide-and-seek, but because there is nothing outside of God, he has no one but himself to play with! But he gets over this difficulty by pretending that he is not himself. This is his way of hiding from himself. He pretends that he is you and I and all the people in the world, all the animals, plants, all the rocks, and all the stars. In this way he has strange and wonderful adventures, some of which are terrible and frightening. But these are just like bad dreams, for when he wakes up they will disappear.Now when God plays \\"hide\\" and pretends that he is you and I, he does it so well that it takes him a long time to remember where and how he hid himself! But that\'s the whole fun of it-just what he wanted to do. He doesn\'t want to find himself too quickly, for that would spoil the game. That is why it is so difficult for you and me to find out that we are God in disguise, pretending not to be himself. But- when the game has gone on long enough, all of us will WAKE UP, stop pretending, and REMEMBER that we are all one single Self- the God who is all that there is and who lives forever and ever.You may ask why God sometimes hides in the form of horrible people, or pretends to be people who suffer great disease and pain. Remember, first, that he isn\'t really doing this to anyone but himself. Remember too, that in almost all the stories you enjoy there have to be bad people as well as good people, for the thrill of the tale is to find out how the good people will get the better of the bad. It\'s the same as when we play cards. At the beginning of the game we shuffle them all into a mess, which is like the bad things in the world, but the point of the game put the mess into good order, and the one who does it best is the winner. Then we shuffle the cards and play again, and so it goes with the world.","Life, like getting an erection, is a spontaneous process which collapses when one tries to force it to happen.","Consequently our age is one of frustration, anxiety, agitation, and addiction to \u201cdope. Somehow we must grab what we can while we can, and drown out the realization that the whole thing is futile and meaningless. This \u201cdope\u201d we call our high standard of living, a violent and complex stimulation of the senses, which makes them progressively less sensitive and thus in need of yet more violent stimulation. We crave distraction\u2014a panorama of sights, sounds, thrills, and titillations into which as much as possible must be crowded in the shortest possible time. To\u201d","We have been accustomed to make this existence worth-while by the belief that there is more than the outward appearance--that we live for a future beyond this life here. For the outward appearance does not seem to make sense. if living is to end in pain, incompleteness, and nothingness, it seems a cruel and futile experience for being who are born to reason, hope, create, and love. man, as a being of sense, wants his life to make sense, and he has found it hard to believe that it does so unless there is more that what he see-- unless there is an eternal order and an eternal life behind the uncertain and momentary experience of life-and-death.","To \u201chave running water you must let go of it and let it run. The same is true of life and of God.\u201d","We suffer from the delusion that the entire universe is held in order by the categories of human thought, fearing that if we do not hold to them with the utmost tenacity, everything will vanish into chaos.We must repeat: memory, thought, language, and logic are essential to human life. They are one half of sanity. But a person, a society, which is only half sane is insane. To look at life without words is not to lose the ability to form words\u2014to think, remember, and plan. To be silent is not to lose your tongue. On the contrary, it is only through silence that one can discover something new to talk about.","Part of man\'s frustration is that he has become accustomed to expect language and thought to offer explanations which they cannot give. To want life to be intelligible in this sense is to want it to be something other than life.","as masters of technical weapons we are fighting the environment as if we still believed ourselves to be strangers on the earth, sent down into this world from a purely abstract, ideational, and spiritual heaven.","God also likes to play hide-and-seek, but because there is nothing outside God, he has no one but himself to play with.

Feelings both positive and negative come and go without turmoil, for they seem to be simply observed, though there is no one observing. They pass trackless like birds in the sky, and build up no resistances which have to be dissipated in reckless action.","The next aspect of the mystical feeling is even more difficult to assimilate into our ordinary practical intelligence. It is the overwhelming sense that everything that happens \u2014 everything that I or anybody else has ever done \u2014 is part of a harmonious design and that there is no error at all.","One of the greatest ideas that has ever been produced is the Hindu idea that the world is a drama in which the central and supreme self behind all existence has gotten lost and has come to believe that it is not the one supreme self, but all the creatures that there are. It has come to believe in its own artistry. And the more involved, the more anxious, the more finite, the more limited the infinite manages to feel itself to be, the greater that artistry, the greater the depth of the illusion that it has created.","Everybody loves to play this game \u2014 the game of hide-and-seek, the game of scaring oneself with uncertainty. It is human. It is why we go to the theater or movies and why we read novels. And our so-called real life, seen from the position of the mystic, is a version of the same thing. The mystic is the person who has realized that the game is a game. It is hide-and-seek, and everything associated with the \u201chide side of it is connected to those places within us where we as individuals feel lonely, impotent, put down, and so on \u2014 the negative side of existence.\u201d","Such questions as \\"Why this universe?\\" are a kind of intellectual neurosis, amisuse of words in that the question sounds sensible but is actually asmeaningless as asking \\"Where is this universe?","I feel cut off only because I am split within myself, because I try to be divided from my own feelings and sensations. What I feel and sense therefore seems foreign to me. And on being aware of the unreality of this division, the universe does not seem foreign any more. For I am what I know; what I know is I. The sensation of a house across the street or of a star in outer space is no less I than an itch on the sole of my foot or an idea in my brain.","We know that human love is genuine only when it is felt in the depth of the heart. And we know that this is true whether it be love for another human or love of God. And, of course, we are always looking to receive genuine love. We don\u2019t want others to love us because they are forced to. We want them to love us because they really do love us in their hearts.","If you read the literature of the great religions, time and time again you come across descriptions of what is usually referred to as \u201cspiritual experience. You will find that in all the various traditions this modality of spiritual experience seems to be the same, whether it occurs in the Christian West, the Islamic Middle East, the Hindu world of Asia, or the Buddhist world. In each culture, it is quite definitely the same experience, and it is characterized by the transcendence of individuality and by a sensation of being one with the total energy of the universe.\u201d","Death is the unknown in which all of us lived before birth.","So, according to Vedanta, the central doctrine of Hinduism, all bodies are the clothes of the one and only Self in its innumerable disguises, and the whole universe is a masquerade ball pretending to be a tragedy and then realizing that it\u2019s a ball.","Life is a series of urgent choices demanding firm commitment to this or to that.","This book explores an unrecognized but mighty taboo\u2014our tacit conspiracy to ignore who, or what, we really are. Briefly, the thesis is that the prevalent sensation of oneself as a separate ego enclosed in a bag of skin is a hallucination which accords neither with Western science nor with the experimental philosophy-religions of the East\u2014in particular the central and germinal Vedanta philosophy of Hinduism. This hallucination underlies the misuse of technology for the violent subjugation of man\u2019s natural environment and, consequently, its eventual destruction.","We look for this security by fortifying and enclosing ourselves in innumerable ways. We want the protection of being \u201cexclusive and \u201cspecial,\u201d seeking to belong to the safest church, the best nation, the highest class, the right set, and the \u201cnice\u201d people. These defenses lead to divisions between us, and so to more insecurity demanding more defenses. Of course it is all done in the sincere belief that we are trying to do the right things and live in the best way; but this, too, is a contradiction.\u201d","A great Zen master said just before he died, \\"From the bathtub, to the bathtub, I have uttered stuff and nonsense.\\" The bathtub in which the baby is washed at birth, the bathtub in which the corpse is washed before burial, all this time I have said much nonsense.","For if we do not know even how we manage to be conscious and intelligent, it is most rash to assume that we know what the role of conscious intelligence will be, and still more that it is competent to order the world.","There is no other reality than present reality, so that, even if one were to live for endless ages, to live for the future would be to miss the point everlastingly.","The difference between having a job and having a vocation is that a job is some unpleasant work you do in order to make money, with the sole purpose of making money. There are plenty of jobs because there is still a certain amount of dirty work that nobody wants to do, and that therefore they will pay someone to do it. There is essentially less and less of that kind of work because of mechanization. If you do a job with the sole purpose of making money, you are absurd, because if money becomes the goal\u2013and it does if you work that way\u2013you begin increasingly to confuse it with happiness or with pleasure. Yes, one can take a handful of crisp one dollar bills and practically water your mouth over it, but this is a kind of person who is confused like a Pavlov dog, who salivates on the wrong bell.","To remain stable is to refrain from trying to separate yourself from a pain because you know that you cannot. Running away from fear is fear, fighting pain is pain, trying to be brave is being scared. If the mind is in pain, the mind is pain. The thinker has no other form than his thought. There is no escape. But so long as you are not aware of the inseparability of thinker and thought, you will try to escape.","We are particular and temporarily identifiable wiggles in a stream that enters us in the form of light, heat, air, water, milk, bread, fruit, beer, beef Stroganoff, caviar, and p\xe2t\xe9 de foie gras.

The madness of the thing is that when such facts are present, we circle, buzz, writhe, and whirl, trying to get the \u201cI out of the experience. We pretend that we are amoebas, and try to protect ourselves from life by splitting in two. Sanity, wholeness, and integration lie in the realization that we are not divided, that man and his present experience are one, and that no separate \u201cI\u201d or mind can be found.\u201d","To understand music, you must listen to it. But so long as you are thinking, \u201cI am listening to this music, you are not listening. To understand joy or fear, you must be wholly and undividedly aware of it. So long as you are calling it names and saying, \u201cI am happy,\u201d or \u201cI am afraid,\u201d you are not being aware of it. Fear, pain, sorrow, and boredom must remain problems if we do not understand them, but understanding requires a single and undivided mind. This, surely, is the meaning of that strange saying, \u201cIf thine eye be single, thy whole body shall be full of light.\u201d","Kindly let me help you or you will drown said the monkey putting the fish safely up a tree.","is in vain that doctors prolong life if we spend the extra time being anxious to live still longer.","The capacity of the brain to forsee the future has much to do with the fear of death.For when the body is worn out and the brain is tired, the whole organism welcomes death. But it is difficult to understand how death can be welcome when you are young and strong, so that you come to regard it as a dread and terrible event. For the brain, in its immaterial way, looks into the future and conceives it a good to go on and on and on forever\u2014not realizing that its own material would at last find the process intolerably tiresome. Not taking this into account, the brain fails to see that, being itself material and subject to change, its desires will change, and a time will come when death will be good. On a bright morning, after a good night\u2019s rest, you do not want to go to sleep. But after a hard day\u2019s work the sensation of dropping into unconsciousness is extraordinarily pleasant.","[T]he important point is that a world of inter-dependent relationships, where things are intelligible only in terms of of each other, is a seamless unity. In such a world it is impossible to consider man apart from nature, as an exiled spirit which controls this world by having its roots in another. Man is himself a loop in the endless knot, and as he pulls in one direction he finds that he is pulled from another and cannot find the origin of the impulse.","Those who speak, do not know; those who know, do not speak.","For the ego exists in an abstract sense alone, being an abstraction from memory, somewhat like the illusory circle of fire made by a whirling torch. We can, for example, imagine the path of a bird through the sky as a distinct line which it has taken. But this line is as abstract as a line of latitude. In concrete reality, the bird left no line, and, similarly, the past from which our ego is abstracted has entirely disappeared. Thus any attempt to cling to the ego or to make it an effective source of action is doomed to frustration.","What I am really saying is that you don\u2019t need to do anything, because if you see yourself in the correct way, you are all as much extraordinary phenomena of nature as trees, clouds, the patterns in running water, the flickering of fire, the arrangement of the stars, and the form of a galaxy. You are all just like that, and there is nothing wrong with you at all.","Thus not to see the unity of self and other is the fear of life, and not to see the unity of being and nonbeing is the fear of death.","In the widest sense of the word, to name is to interpret experience by the past, to translate it into terms of memory, to bind the unknown into the system of the known. Civilized man knows of hardly any other way of understanding things. Everybody, everything, has to have its label, its number, certificate, registration, classification. What is not classified is irregular, unpredictable, and dangerous. Without passport, birth certificate, or membership in some nation, one\u2019s existence is not recognized.","Problems that remain persistently insoluble should always be suspected as questions asked in the wrong way,","Nothing is more creative than death, since it is the whole secret of life. It means that the past must be abandoned, that the unknown cannot be avoided, that \u201cI cannot continue, and that nothing can be ultimately fixed. When a man knows this, he lives for the first time in his life. By holding his breath, he loses it. By letting go he finds it.\u201d","But by meditation I do not mean a practice or exercise undertaken as a preparation for something, as a means to some future end, or as a discipline in which one is concerned with progress. A better word may be \\"contemplation\\" or even \\"centering,\\" for what I mean is a slowing down of time, of mental hurry, and an allowing of one\'s attention to rest in the present\u2014so coming to the unseeking observation, not of what should be, but of what is.","Subjectively, a gnat doubtless feels that its span of a few days is a reasonably long lifetime. A tortoise, with its span of several hundred years, would feel subjectively the same as the gnat. Not so long ago the life expectancy of the average man was about forty-five years. Today it is from sixty-five to seventy years, but subjectively the years are faster, and death, when it comes, is always all too soon.","We have arbitrarily agreed to define the sun by the limit of its visible fire.","Sexuality is not a separate compartment of human life; it is a radiance pervading every human relationship, but assuming a particular intensity at certain points.","The very identity of racist Southerners depends upon contrasting themselves with those dirty black \u201cnigras. But, conversely, the out-groups feel that they are really and truly \u201cin,\u201d and nourish their collective ego with relishingly indignant conversation about squares, Ofays, Wasps, Philistines, and the blasted bourgeoisie. Even Saint Thomas Aquinas let it out that part of the blessedness of the saints in Heaven was that they could look over the battlements and enjoy the \u201cproper justice\u201d of the sinners squirming in Hell. All winners need losers; all saints need sinners; all sages need fools\u2014that is, so long as the major kick in life is to \u201camount to something\u201d or to \u201cbe someone\u201d as a particular and separate godlet.\u201d","The universe is everlasting. The reason that the universe is everlasting is that it does not live for itself. Therefore it lasts. Therefore the sage puts himself behind, and finds himself in front, regards his person as outside himself, and his person is preserved. Is it not because he does not live for himself that he realizes himself?","What do you desire? What makes you itch? What sort of a situation would you like?","For unless one is able to live fully in the present, the future is a hoax. There is no point whatever in making plans for a future which you will never be able to enjoy. When your plans mature, you will still be living for some other future beyond. You will never, never be able to sit back with full contentment and say, \u201cNow, I\u2019ve arrived!

Foresight is bought at the price of anxiety, and, when overused, it destroys all its own advantages. The\u201d","My vocation in life is to wonder about at the nature of the universe. This leads me into philosophy, psychology, religion, and mysticism, not only as subjects to be discussed but also as things to be experienced, and thus I make an at least tacit claim to be a philosopher and a mystic. Some people, therefore, expect me to be their guru or messiah or exemplar, and are extremely disconcerted when they discover my \u201cwayward spirit or element of irreducible rascality, and say to their friends, \u201cHow could he possibly be a genuine mystic and be so addicted to nicotine and alcohol?\u201d Or have occasional shudders of anxiety? Or be sexually interested in women? Or lack enthusiasm for physical exercise? Or have any need for money? Such people have in mind an idealized vision of the mystic as a person wholly free from fear and attachment, who sees within and without, and on all sides, only the translucent forms of a single divine energy which is everlasting love and delight, as which and from which he effortlessly radiates peace, charity, and joy. What an enviable situation! We, too, would like to be one of those, but as we start to meditate and look into ourselves we find mostly a quaking and palpitating mess of anxiety which lusts and loathes, needs love and attention, and lives in terror of death putting an end to its misery. So we despise that mess, and look for ways of controlling it and putting \u201chow the true mystic feels\u201d in its place, not realizing that this ambition is simply one of the lusts of the quaking mess, and that this, in turn, is a natural form of the universe like rain and frost, slugs and snails, flies and disease. When the \u201ctrue mystic\u201d sees flies and disease as translucent forms of the divine, that does not abolish them. I\u2014making no hard-and-fast distinction between inner and outer experience\u2014see my quaking mess as a form of the divine, and that doesn\u2019t abolish it either.

Discovering this the mind becomes whole: the split between I and me, man and the world, the ideal and the real, comes to an end. Paranoia, the mind beside itself, becomes metanoia, the mind with itself and so free from itself. Free from clutching at themselves the hands can handle; free from looking after themselves the eyes can see; free from trying to understand itself thought can think. In such feeling, seeing, and thinking life requires no future to complete itself nor explanation to justify itself. In this moment it is finished.","The phenomenon moon-in-the-water is likened to human experience. The water is the subject, and the moon the object. When there is no water, there is no moon-in-the-water, and likewise when there is no moon. But when the moon rises the water does not wait to receive its image, and when even the tiniest drop of water is poured out the moon does not wait to cast its reflection. For the moon does not intend to cast its reflection, and the water does not receive its image on purpose. The event is caused as much by the water as by the moon, and as the water manifests the brightness of the moon, the moon manifests the clarity of the water. Another poem in the Zenrin Kushu says: Trees show the bodily form of the wind; Waves give vital energy to the moon.g","What\u2019s it gonna be like, dying?

They are not arranged; instead they seem to be scattered through the heavens like sea spray. Yet you could never criticize stars for displaying poor taste, any more than you could criticize mountain ranges for having awkward proportions. These designs are spontaneous, and yet they demonstrate the wiggly patterns of nature that are quite different from anything you would call a mess. We can\u2019t quite put our finger on what the difference is between the two, but we certainly can see the difference between a tide pool and an ashtray full of garbage. We may not be able to define the difference, but we know they are different.","All too easily, we confuse the world as we symbolize it with the world as it is.","Most of us in our thinking are wandering from this to that to the other thing, and are constantly distracted. And Zen is the opposite of that. It\u2019s being completely here, fully in the present. And you know when you\u2019re completely concentrated, you\u2019re not really aware of your own existence. It\u2019s rather the same as the sense of sight. If you see your eyes, that is to say if you see spots in front of your eyes, or something on the lens of the eye, then you\u2019re not seeing properly. To the degree to which you\u2019re seeing properly, you\u2019re unaware of your eyes. In the same way, if your clothes fit well, you\u2019re unaware of them on your body. And if you\u2019re completely concentrated on what you\u2019re doing, you\u2019re unaware of yourself.","The organism of man does not confront the world but is in the world.","Your hair grows by itself, your heart beats by itself, and your breath happens pretty much by itself. Your glands secrete the essences by themselves and you do not have voluntary control over these things, and so we say they happen spontaneously. So, when you go to bed and try to go to sleep you interfere with the spontaneous process of going to sleep. If you try to breathe real hard you will find you get balled-up in your breathing. So if you are to be human, you just have to trust yourself to go to sleep, to digest your food, and to have bowel movements. Of course if something goes seriously wrong and you need a surgeon that is another matter, but by and large the healthy human being does not from the start of life need surgical interference. One lets it happen by itself, and so with the whole picture that is fundamental to it. You have to let go and let it happen, because if you don\u2019t then you are constantly going to be trying to do what happens easily only if you do not try. When you think a bit about what people really want to do with their time, and you ask what they do when they are not being pushed around or somebody is telling them what to do, you find they like to make rhythms.

In self-defense the body gets ill from the strain, but the brain wants to go on and on. The brain is in pursuit of happiness, and because the brain is much more concerned about the future than the present, it conceives happiness as the guarantee of an indefinitely long future of pleasures. Yet the brain also knows that it does not have an indefinitely long future, so that, to be happy, it must try to crowd all the pleasures of Paradise and eternity into the span of a few years.","In the Garden of Eden Adam saw the animals before he named them: in the traditional system, children named the animals before they saw them.1","When we are in control of everything and we have great panels of push buttons whereby the slightest touch fulfills every wish, what will we want then? We will eventually want to arrange to have a special, red button marked \u201csurprise built into the panel. Touch that button and what happens? We will suddenly disappear from our normal consciousness and find ourselves in a situation very much like the one we are now in, where we feel ourselves to be a little bit out of control, subject to surprises, and subject to the whims of an unpredictable universe.\u201d","But Taoism must on no account be understood as a revolution against convention, although it has sometimes been used as a pretext for revolution. Taoism is a way of liberation, which never comes by means of revolution, since it is notorious that most revolutions establish worse tyrannies than they destroy. To be free from convention is not to spurn it but not to be deceived by it. It is to be able to use it as an instrument instead of being used by it.","When I stand by the stream and watch it, I am relatively still, and the flowing water makes a path across my memory so that I realize its transience in comparison with my stability. This is, of course, an illusion in the sense that I, too, am in flow and likewise have no final destination\u2014for can anyone imagine finality as a form of life? My death will be the disappearance of a particular pattern in the water. Feeling","We do not feel that ordinarily, do we? What we feel, instead, is an identification of ourselves with our ideas of ourselves \u2014 I would rather say, with our image of ourselves. That is the person, or the ego. You play a role; you identify with that role. I play a role called Alan Watts. And I know very well that it is a big act. I can play some other roles besides Alan Watts if necessary, but I find this one is best for making a living. But I assure you that is a mask and I do not take it seriously. The idea of my being a kind of guru, or savior of the world just breaks me up, because I know me. Besides, it is very difficult to be holy, in the ordinary sense.","The common mistake of the religious celibate has been to suppose that the highest spiritual life absolutely demands the renunciation of sexuality, as if the knowledge of God were an alternative to the knowledge of woman, or to any other form of experience.","fear is born of duality\u2014","If the ego were to disappear, or rather, to be seen as a useful fiction, there would no longer be the duality of subject and object, experiencer and experience. There would simply be a continuous, self-moving stream of experiencing, without the sense either of an active subject who controls it or of a passive subject who suffers it. The thinker would be no more than the series of thoughts, and the feeler no more than the feelings.","The difference between having a job and having a vocation is that a job is some unpleasant work you do in order to make money, with the sole purpose of making money. There are plenty of jobs because there is still a certain amount of dirty work that nobody wants to do, and that therefore they will pay someone to do it. There is essentially less and less of that kind of work because of mechanisation. If you do a job with the sole purpose of making money, you are absurd, because if money becomes the goal\u2013and it does if you work that way\u2013you begin increasingly to confuse it with happiness or with pleasure. Yes, one can take a handful of crisp one dollar bills and practically water your mouth over it, but this is a kind of person who is confused like a Pavlov dog, who salivates on the wrong bell.","\u10e4\u10dd\u10dc\u10d8\u10e1 \u10d2\u10d0\u10e0\u10e9\u10d4\u10d5\u10d0\u10e1 \u10d7\u10e3 \u10d8\u10e1\u10ec\u10d0\u10d5\u10da\u10d8\u10d7, \u10d8\u10d2\u10d8\u10d5\u10d4\u10e1 \u10d0\u10e6\u10db\u10dd\u10d0\u10e9\u10d4\u10dc\u10d7, \u10e0\u10d0\u10e1\u10d0\u10ea - \u10db\u10e3\u10e1\u10d8\u10d9\u10d0\u10e8\u10d8. \u10d1\u10d2\u10d4\u10e0\u10d4\u10d1\u10e1 \u10e8\u10dd\u10e0\u10d8\u10e1 \u10d8\u10dc\u10e2\u10d4\u10e0\u10d5\u10d0\u10da\u10d4\u10d1\u10d8\u10e1 \u10d2\u10d0\u10db\u10dd\u10d0, \u10db\u10d4\u10da\u10dd\u10d3\u10d8\u10d0 \u10e0\u10dd\u10db \u10d2\u10d5\u10d4\u10e1\u10db\u10d8\u10e1. \u10d8\u10dc\u10e2\u10d4\u10e0\u10d5\u10d0\u10da\u10d4\u10d1\u10e1 \u10e0\u10dd\u10db \u10d5\u10d4\u10e0 \u10d0\u10e6\u10d5\u10d8\u10e5\u10d5\u10d0\u10db\u10d3\u10d4\u10d7, \u10e0\u10d8\u10e2\u10db\u10d8 \u10d2\u10d0\u10db\u10dd\u10d2\u10e0\u10e9\u10d4\u10d1\u10dd\u10d3\u10d0\u10d7 \u10d3\u10d0 \u10dc\u10dd\u10e2\u10d4\u10d1\u10d8 \u10d4\u10e0\u10d7\u10d8 \u10d3\u10d0 \u10d8\u10db\u10d0\u10d5\u10d4 \u10ee\u10db\u10d8\u10e1 \u10d5\u10d0\u10e0\u10d8\u10d0\u10ea\u10d8\u10d4\u10d1\u10d0\u10d3 \u10d8\u10e5\u10ea\u10d4\u10dd\u10d3\u10dc\u10d4\u10dc. \u10db\u10d4\u10da\u10dd\u10d3\u10d8\u10d0 \u10e0\u10dd\u10db \u10db\u10dd\u10d8\u10e1\u10db\u10d8\u10dc\u10dd\u10d7, \u10dc\u10dd\u10e2\u10d4\u10d1\u10e1 \u10e8\u10dd\u10e0\u10d8\u10e1 \u10d8\u10dc\u10e2\u10d4\u10e0\u10d5\u10d0\u10da\u10d8 \u10e3\u10dc\u10d3\u10d0 \u10d2\u10d4\u10e1\u10db\u10dd\u10d3\u10d4\u10d7. \u10db\u10e1\u10d2\u10d0\u10d5\u10e1\u10d0\u10d3 \u10d0\u10db\u10d8\u10e1\u10d0, \u10e3\u10dc\u10d3\u10d0 \u10e8\u10d4\u10eb\u10da\u10dd\u10d7 \u10d0\u10d3\u10d0\u10db\u10d8\u10d0\u10dc\u10d4\u10d1\u10e1 \u10e8\u10dd\u10e0\u10d8\u10e1 \u10d0\u10e0\u10e1\u10d4\u10d1\u10e3\u10da\u10d8 \u10d8\u10dc\u10e2\u10d4\u10e0\u10d5\u10d0\u10da\u10d8 \u10d3\u10d0\u10d8\u10dc\u10d0\u10ee\u10dd\u10d7 - \u10d8\u10e1, \u10e0\u10d0\u10ea \u10d0\u10e0 \u10d2\u10d0\u10db\u10dd\u10d8\u10d7\u10e5\u10db\u10d8\u10e1 \u10d3\u10d0 \u10e0\u10d0\u10ea \u10e8\u10d8\u10dc\u10d0\u10d2\u10d0\u10dc\u10d8\u10d0. \u10db\u10d0\u10e8\u10d8\u10dc \u10d3\u10d0\u10d8\u10ec\u10e7\u10d4\u10d1\u10d7 \u10d4\u10e0\u10d7\u10db\u10d0\u10dc\u10d4\u10d7\u10d7\u10d0\u10dc \u10e8\u10d4\u10d9\u10d0\u10d5\u10e8\u10d8\u10e0\u10d4\u10d1\u10d0\u10e1.","the mystery of life is not a problem to be solved, but a reality to be experienced.","The experience of sexual love is therefore no longer to be sought as the repetition of a familiar ecstasy, prejudiced by the expectation of what we already know.

But in Zen, and in other schools of the Mahayana, it is often taken in a more figurative way, as that the process of rebirth is from moment to moment, so that one is being reborn so long as one identifies himself with a continuing ego which reincarnates itself afresh at each moment of time. Thus the validity and interest of the doctrine does not require acceptance of a special theory of survival.","They are our beliefs, our cherished preconceptions of the truth, which block the unreserved opening of mind and heart to reality. The legitimate use of images is to express the truth, not to possess it.","If living is to end in pain, incompleteness, and nothingness, it seems a cruel and futile experience for beings who are born to reason, hope, create, and love.","You do not want to be God to the annihilation of your own individuality, for then there would be no \u201cyou to enjoy being God.\u201d","Life and death are not two opposed forces; they are simply two ways of looking at the same force, for the movement of change is as much the builder as the destroyer. The human body lives because it is a complex of motions, of circulation, respiration, and digestion. To resist change, to try to cling to life, is therefore like holding your breath: if you persist you kill yourself.","But if we were to realize that we are, as it were, all action, all deed \u2014 the doer vanishes, and with it vanishes this sense of man as something separate, something cut off, walled away from the rest of the world by his skin. When that realization comes about; when, in other words, our own separateness disappears, we have what the Buddha called nirvana","Is a long life such a good thing if it is lived in daily dread of death or in constant search for satisfaction in a tomorrow which never comes?","The highest that man can attain in these matters, said Goethe, \u201cis wonder; if the primary phenomenon causes this, let him be satisfied; more it cannot bring; and he should forbear to seek for anything further behind it: here is the limit. But the sight of a prime phenomenon is generally not enough for people. They think they must go still further; and are thus like children, who, after peeping into a mirror, turn it round directly to see what is on the other side.\u201d","The world of \u201csuchness is void and empty because it teases the mind out of thought, dumbfounding the chatter of definition so that there is nothing left to be said. Yet it is obvious that we are not confronted with literal nothingness. It is true that, when pressed, every attempt to catch hold of our world leaves us empty-handed. Furthermore, when we try to be sure at least of ourselves, the knowing, catching subjects, we disappear. We cannot find any self apart from the mind, and we cannot find any mind apart from those very experiences which the mind \u2013 now vanished \u2013 was trying to grasp.\u201d","God is the most obvious thing in the world. He is absolutely self-evident - the simplest, clearest and closest reality of life and consciousness. We are only unaware of him because we are too complicated, for our vision is darkened by the complexity of pride. We seek him beyond the horizon with our noses lifted high in the air, and fail to see that he lies at our very feet. We flatter ourselves in premeditating the long, long journey we are going to take in order to find him, the giddy heights of spiritual progress we are going to scale, and all the time are unaware of the truth that \\"God is nearer to us than we are to ourselves.\\" We are like birds flying in quest of the air, or men with lighted candles searching through the darkness for fire.","But this is at the same time a vivid way of saying that your soul, or rather your essential Self, is the whole cosmos as it is centered around the particular time, place, and activity called John Doe. Thus the soul is not in the body, but the body in the soul, and the soul is the entire network of relationships and processes which make up your environment, and apart from which you are nothing.","The highest to which man can attain is wonder; and if the prime phenomenon makes him wonder, let him be content; nothing higher can it give him, and nothing further should he seek for behind it; here is the limit.","There is no difference in principle between sharpening perception with an external instrument, such as a microscope, and sharpening it with an internal instrument, such as one of these three drugs. If they are an affront to the dignity of the mind, the microscope is an affront to the dignity of the eye and the telephone to the dignity of the ear. Strictly speaking, these drugs do not impart wisdom at all, any more than the microscope alone gives knowledge.","The man of perfect virtue in repose has no thoughts, in action no anxiety. He recognizes no right, nor wrong, nor good, nor bad. Within the Four Seas, when all profit\u2014that is his repose. Men cling to him as children who have lost their mothers; they rally around him as wayfarers who have missed their road. He has wealth to spare, but he knows not whence it comes. He has food and drink more than sufficient, but knows not who provides it\u2026. In an age of perfect virtue, good men are not appreciated; ability is not conspicuous. Rulers are mere beacons, while the people are as free as the wild deer. They are upright without being conscious of duty to their neighbors. They love one another without being conscious of charity. They are true without being conscious of loyalty. They are honest without being conscious of good faith. They act freely in all things without recognizing obligations to anyone. Thus, their deeds leave no trace; their affairs are not handed down to posterity.5 [62a]","It is surely absurd to seek God in terms of a preconceived idea of what God is. To seek thus is only to find what we know already, which is why it is so easy to deceove oneself into all manner of \\"supernatural\\" experiences and visions. To believe in God and to look for the God you believe in is simply to seek confirmation of an opinion.","Almost all civilized peoples have been brought up to think of themselves as ghosts in machines,","What we know by memory, we know only at secondhand.","When it comes down to it, government is simply an abandonment of responsibility on the assumption that there are people, other than ourselves, who really know how to manage things. But the government, run ostensibly for the good of the people, becomes a self-serving corporation. To keep things under control it proliferates laws of ever-increasing complexity and unintelligibility, and hinders productive work by demanding so much accounting on paper that the record of what has been done becomes more important than what has actually been done. The Taoist moral is that people who mistrust themselves and one another are doomed.","Myth, then, is the form in which I try to answer when children ask me those fundamental metaphysical questions which come so readily to their minds: \\"Where did the world come from?\\" \\"Why did God make the world?\\" \\"Where was I before I was born?\\" \\"Where do people gowhen they die?\\" Again and again I have found that they seem to be satisfied with a simple and very ancient story, which goes something like this: \\"There was never a time when the world began, because it goes round and round like a circle, and there is no place on a circle where itbegins. Look at my watch, which tells the time; it goes round, and so the world repeats itself again and again. But just as the hour-hand of the watch goes up to twelve and down to six, so, too, there is day and night, waking and sleeping, living and dying, summer and winter. You can\'t have any one of these without the other, because you wouldn\'t be able to know what black is unless you had seen it side-by-side with white, or white unless side-by-side with black.","To understand this is to realize that life is entirely momentary, that there is neither permanence nor security, and that there is no \u201cI which can be protected.\u201d","The sense of wrong is simply failure to see where something fits into a pattern[.]","It is both dangerous and absurd for our world to be a group of communions mutually excommunicate.","The commonly accepted notion that Americans are materialists is pure bunk. A materialist is one who loves material, a person devoted to the enjoyment of the physical and immediate present. By this definition, most Americans are abstractionists. They hate material, and convert it as swiftly as possible into mountains of junk and clouds of poisonous gas. As","To pursue it is to pursue a constantly retreating phantom, and the faster you chase it, the faster it runs ahead, This is why all the affairs of civilization are rushed, why hardly anyone enjoys what he has, and is forever seeking more and more. Happiness, then, will consist, not of solid and substantial realities, but of such abstract and superficial things as promises, hopes, and assurances.","Actually, the world is not complex. It is the task of trying to figure it out with words or numbers which is complex.","The outsider cannot just barge in like Santa Claus and put things to right\u2014especially our kind of outsider who, because he has no sense of belonging in the world, invariably smells like an interferer. He does not really know what he wants, and therefore everyone suspects that there are limitless strings attached to his gifts. For if you know what you want, and will be content with it, you can be trusted. But if you do not know, your desires are limitless and no one can tell how to deal with you. Nothing satisfies an individual incapable of enjoyment.","To begin with, this world has a different kind of time. It is the time of biological rhythm, notof the clock and all that goes with the clock. There is no hurry. Our sense of time isnotoriously subjective and thus dependent upon the quality of our attention, whether ofinterest or boredom, and upon the alignment of our behavior in terms of routines, goals, and deadlines. Here the present is self-sufficient, but it is not a static present. It is adancing present, the unfolding of a pattern which has no specific destination in the futurebut is simply its own point. It leaves and arrives simultaneously, and the seed is as muchthe goal as the flower. There is therefore time to perceive every detail of the movementwith infinitely greater richness of articulation. Normally we do not so much look at things asoverlook them.","Other people teach us who we are. Their attitudes to us are the mirror in which we learn to see ourselves, but the mirror is distorted!","The measuring of worth and success in the terms of time, and the insistent demand for assurances of a promising future, make it impossible to live freely both in the present and in the \\"promising\\" future when it arrives. For there is never anything but the present, and if one cannot live there, one cannot live anywhere.","Zen master is not trying to give you ideas about life; he is trying to give you life itself, to make you realize life in and around you, to make you live it instead of being a mere spectator, a mere pedant absorbed in the dry bones of something which the life has long deserted. A symphony is not explained by a mathematical analysis of its notes; the mystery of a woman\u2019s beauty is not revealed by a postmortem dissection; and no one ever understood the wonder of a bird on the wing by stuffing it and putting it in a glass case. To understand these things, you must live and move with them as they are alive. The same is true of the universe: no amount of intellectual analysis will explain it, for philosophy and science can only reveal its mechanism, never its meaning or, as the Chinese say, its Tao. \u201cWhat is the Tao? A Zen master answers, \u201cUsual life is the very Tao.\u201d \u201cHow does one bring oneself into accord with it?\u201d \u201cIf you try to accord with it, you will get away from it.\u201d For to imagine that there is a \u201cyou\u201d separate from life which somehow has to accord with life is to fall straight into the trap.\u201d","backwards law.

The first is a certain physical territory, largely on the North American continent, including all such geographical and biological features as lakes, mountains and rivers, skies and clouds, plants, animals, and people. The second is a sovereign political state, existing in competition with many other sovereign states jostling one another around the surface of this planet. Thefirst sense is concrete and material; the second, abstract and conceptual.If the United States continues for very much longer to exist in this second sense, it will cease to exist in the first.\u201d","As a consequence, we are at war within ourselves\u2014the brain desiring things which the body does not want, and the body desiring things which the brain does not allow; the brain giving directions which the body will not follow, and the body giving impulses which the brain cannot understand. In","By itself, a tree is meaningless, but it is the meaning of the word \u201ctree.","It is a special kind of enlightenment to have this feeling that the usual, the way things normally are, is odd\u2014uncanny and highly improbable. G. K. Chesterton once said that it is one thing to be amazed at a gorgon or a griffin, creatures which do not exist; but it is quite another and much higher thing to be amazed at a rhinoceros or a giraffe, creatures which do exist and look as if they don\u2019t.","What we have forgotten is that thoughts and words are conventions, and that it is fatal to take conventions too seriously. A convention is a social convenience, as, for example, money. Money gets rid of the inconveniences of barter. But it is absurd to take money too seriously, to confuse it with real wealth, because it will do you no good to eat it or wear it for clothing. Money is more or less static, for gold, silver, strong paper, or a bank balance can \u201cstay put for a long time. But real wealth, such as food, is perishable. Thus a community may possess all the gold in the world, but if it does not farm its crops it will starve.\u201d","The result of feeling that we are separate minds in an alien,and mostly stupid, universe is that we have no common sense, no way of making sense of the world upon which we are agreed in common. It\'s just my opinion against yours, and therefore the most aggressive and violent (and thus insensitive) propagandist makes the decisions. A muddle of conflicting opinions united by force of propaganda","Lao-tzu didn\u2019t actually say very much more about the meaning of Tao. The Way of Nature, the Way of happening self-so, or, if you like, the very process of life, was something which he was much too wise to define. For to try to say anything definite about the Tao is like trying to eat your mouth: you can\u2019t get outside it to chew it. To put it the other way round: anything you can chew is not your mouth.","I know, then, that after I die other bodies, other eyeings, will be born. But this is really the same thing as saying that after I die I will again awake as a baby\u2014any baby, but only one\u2014just as I did before but without remembering the previous trip. For anyone who argues that after death there will be nothingness forever is really saying that when he dies the universe will cease to be. But we know that it goes on after people die, and that because it does the eyeing it is really more my self than this particular body.","To notice is to select, toregard some bits of perception, or some features of the world, as morenoteworthy, more significant, than others. To these we attend, and therest we ignore\u2014for which reason conscious attention is at the same time ignorance despite the fact that it gives us a vividlyclear picture of whatever we choose to notice.","The power of memories and expectations is such that for most human beings the past and the future are not as real, but more real than the present. The present cannot be lived happily unless the past has been \u201ccleared up and the future is bright with promise.\u201d","You don\'t have to let go, because there\'s nothing to hold onto. --Alan Watts","Carried to its final extreme, the logical end of this type of reaction to life is suicide. The hard-bitten kind of person is always, as it were, a partial suicide; some of himself is already dead","In the Chinese metaphysical tradition this is termed wu-hsin or \'idealness\', signifying a state of consciousness in which one simply accepts experiences as they come without interfering with them on the one hand or identifying oneself with them on the other. One does not judge them, form theories about them, try to control them, or attempt to change their nature in any way; one lets them be free to be just exactly what they are. \'The perfect man\', said Chuang-tzu, \'employs his mind as a mirror; it grasps nothing, it refuses nothing, it receives but does not keep.","On the one hand there is myself, and on the other the rest of the universe. I am not rooted in the earth like a tree. I rattle around independently. I seem to be the center of everything, and yet cut off and alone.","As poets value the sounds of words above their meanings, and images above arguments, I am trying to get thinking people to be aware of the actual vibrations of life as they would listen to music.","It\u2019s the sort of snarl that self-consciousness can get into, and we call this anxiety. When I keep thinking over and over again, \u201cDid I do the right thing?\u2014if I\u2019m constantly aware of myself in a kind of anxious, critical way\u2014my resonance becomes too high, and I get confused and jittery. But if you learn that self-consciousness has limits, that self-awareness cannot possibly enable you to be free of making mistakes, you can learn to be spontaneous in spite of being self-aware. And you can enjoy the echo.\u201d","The realm of liberation is absolutely incommensurable with the relativities of higher and lower, better and worse, gain and loss, since these are all disadvantages of the ego.","According to tradition, the originator of Taoism, Lao-tzu, was an older contemporary of Kung Fu-tzu, or Confucius, who died in 479 B.C.1 Lao-tzu is said to have been the author of the Tao Te Ching, a short book of aphorisms, setting forth the principles of the Tao and its power or virtue (Te e). But traditional Chinese philosophy ascribes both Taoism and Confucianism to a still earlier source, to a work which lies at the very foundation of Chinese thought and culture, dating anywhere from 3000 to 1200 B.C. This is the I Ching, or Book of Changes.","Our difficulty is that human consciousness has not adjusted itself to a relational and integrated view of nature. We must see that consciousness is neither an isolated soul nor the mere function of a single nervous system, but of that totality of interrelated stars and galaxies which makes a nervous system possible.","Thus when the line between myself and what happens to me is dissolved and there is no stronghold left for an ego even as a passive witness, I find myself not in a world but as a world which is neither compulsive nor capricious. What happens is neither automatic nor arbitrary: it just happens, and all happenings are mutually interdependent in a way that seems unbelievably harmonious. Every this goes with every that. Without others there is no self, and without somewhere else there is no here, so that\u2014in this sense\u2014self is other and here is there.","The mark of an intelligent and educated man is one who does not really accept the idea of \\"work\\". That is to say; he does not accept the process of doing chores every day, that aren\'t in the least bit interesting to him, just in order to go on living.","[E]very individual is a unique manifestation of the Whole, as every branch is a particular outreaching of the tree. To manifest individuality, every branch must have a sensitive connection with the tree, just as our independently moving and differentiated fingers must have a sensitive connection with the whole body. The point, which can hardly be repeated too often, is that differentiation is not separation. The head and the feet are different, but not separate, and though man is not connected to the universe by exactly the same physical relation as branch to tree or feet to head, he is nonetheless connected\u2014and by physical relations of fascinating complexity.","Life exists only at this very moment, and in this moment it is infinite and eternal. For the present moment is infinitely small; before we can measure it, it has gone, and yet it exists forever. . . . You may believe yourself out of harmony with life and its eternal Now; but you cannot be, for you are life and exist Now.\u2014from Become What You Are\u201d","The senses, feelings, and thoughts must be allowed to be spontaneous in the faith that they will then order themselves harmoniously. To try to control the mind forcefully is like trying to flatten out waves with a board, and can only result in more and more disturbance.","As a mirror of our own inner division, we have fragmented the world into inner and outer experience. We embrace our separateness without realizing that there is only one reality. The universe is a single process occurring in consciousness (\u201cthe great stream), and only by merging into that process can we discover who we really are.\u201d","The human organism has the same kind of innate intelligence as the ecosystems of nature, and the wisdom of the nerves and senses must be watched with patience and respect.","Man as an organism is to the world outside like a whirlpool is to a river: man and world are a single natural process, but we are behaving as if we were invaders and plunderers in a foreign territory. For when the individual is defined and felt as the separate personality or ego, he remains unaware that his actual body is a dancing pattern of energy that simply does not happen by itself. It happens only in concert with myriads of other patterns\u2014called animals, plants, insects, bacteria, minerals, liquids, and gases. The definition of a person and the normal feeling of \u201cI do not effectively include these relationships. You say, \u201cI came into this world.\u201d You didn\u2019t; you came out of it, as a branch from a tree.\u201d","When you confer spiritual authority on another person, you must realize that you are allowing them to pick your pocket and sell you your own watch. How","But this must not be confused with our usual ideas of the practice of \u201cunselfishness, which is the effort to identify with others and their needs while still under the strong illusion of being no more than a skin-contained ego. Such \u201cunselfishness\u201d is apt to be a highly refined egotism, comparable to the in-group which plays the game of \u201cwe\u2019re-more-tolerant-than-you.\u201d The Vedanta was not originally moralistic; it did not urge people to ape the saints without sharing their real motivations, or to ape motivations without sharing the knowledge which sparks them.\u201d","Do not suppose, however, that we are merely a society of lotus-eaters, lolling on divans and cuddling lovely women. Ecstasy is something higher, or further out, than ordinary pleasure, and few hippies realized that its achievement requires a particular discipline and skill that is comparable to the art of sailing. We do not resist the vibrations, pulses, and rhythms of nature, just as the yachtsman does not resist the wind. But he knows how to manage his sails and, therefore, can use the wind to go wherever he wishes. The art of life, as we see it, is navigation.","On the one hand, there are people known as straight, regular, square (and there are also cubes and tesseracts), classified, degreed, graduated, and moneyed, who live in little boxes made of ticky-tacky, cultivate lawn order, and want to get things ironed out in nothing flat. On the other, there are bohemians, nuts, bums, freaks, eccentrics, beatifics, whollymen, courtesans, vagrants, and hippies (a name which ought to have something to do with the dangerous curves of women\u2019s hips), who want to experience the universe in a groovy, swinging, ecstatic, syncopated, rock-and-rolling, mind-blown, turned-on, and far-out way.","you cannot understand life and its mysteries as long as you try to grasp it. Indeed, you cannot grasp it, just as you cannot walk off with a river in a bucket. If you try to capture running water in a bucket, it is clear that you do not understand it and that you will always be disappointed, for in the bucket the water does not run. To \u201chave running water you must let go of it and let it run. The same is true of life and of God.\u201d","It is not well known that all the best angels wear their haloes jauntily, over one ear.","we can only believe in what we have already known, preconceived, and imagined. But this is beyond any imagination.","Nothing is really more inhuman than human relations based on morals. When a man gives bread in order to be charitable, lives with a woman in order to be faithful, eats with a Negro in order to be unprejudiced, and refuses to kill in order to be peaceful, he is as cold as a clam. He does not actually see the other person. Only a little less chilly is the benevolence springing from pity, which acts to remove suffering because it finds the sight of it disgusting. But","This experience which we call things, colors, sounds, smells, tastes, forms, and weights is, in itself, no thing, no form, no number, no nothing\u2014but at this moment we behold it. We are, then, beholding the God which traditional doctrines call the boundless, formless, infinite, eternal, undivided, unmoved, and unchanging Reality\u2014the Absolute behind the relative, the Meaning behind thoughts and words.1 Naturally the Meaning is meaning-less because, unlike words, it does not have meaning but is meaning.","When you no longer make the distinction between the universe and how you are acting upon it, you are really on your own and so acquire a sense of responsibility.","the greatest illusion of the abstract ego is that it can do anything to bring about radical improvement either in itself or in the world.","A Chinese philosophical work called The Secret of the Golden Flower says that \u201cwhen purpose has been used to achieve purposelessness, the thing has been grasped. For a society surviving to no purpose is one that makes no provision for purposeless behavior\u2014that is, for actions not directly aimed at survival, which fulfill themselves in being done in the present and do not necessarily imply some future reward. But indirectly and unintentionally, such behavior is useful for survival because it gives a point to surviving\u2014not, however, when pursued for that reason. To play so as to be relaxed and refreshed for work is not to play, and no work is well and finely done unless it, too, is a form of play.\u201d","For unless one is able to live fully in the present, the future is a hoax.There is no point whatever in making plans for a future which you will never be able to enjoy. When your plans mature, you will still be living for some other future beyond. You will never, never be able to sit back with full contentment and say, \\"Now, I\'ve arrived!\\" Your entire education has deprived you of this capacity because it was preparing you for the future, instead of showing you how to be alive now.","[T]he paradox of civilization is that the more one is anxious to survive, the less survival is worth the trouble.","On the other hand, others felt that the world was a state of probation where material goods were to be used in a spirit of stewardship, as loans from the Almighty, and where the main work of life is loving devotion to God and to man.","salvation and sanity consist in the most radical recognition that we have no way of saving ourselves. This","If, then, a pleasurable state is to be conscious, it cannot be constant, for there will be no contrasting ground against which to feel it. Pleasure is thus in fact the configuration pleasure/non-pleasure (e.g., pleasure/pain, pleasure/anxiety, pleasure/boredom, pleasure/hunger, etc.) in which the first term is the figure and the second the ground.","The Dhammapada, a collection of sayings of the Buddha, begins: \u201cAll that we are is the result of what we have thought. It is founded on our thoughts; it is made up of our thoughts. This is, in effect, the same statement that opens St. John\u2019s Gospel: \u201cIn the beginning was the Word, and the Word was with God, and the Word was God.\u2026 All things were made by him (the Word), and without him was not anything made that was made.\u201d By thoughts, or mental words, we distinguish or \u201cmake\u201d things. Without thoughts, there are no \u201cthings\u201d; there is just undefined reality.\u201d","If the earth is man\u2019s extended body, to be loved and respected as one\u2019s own body, those who do no greening of themselves will hardly bring about the greening of America.","[...]all saints need sinners.","The concepts of health and sickness, good and evil, better and worse, have the same use and relation to life as those of long and short, high and low to carpentry: even a short piece of wood can be three inches long. Even cancer is called a growth, and when Ramana Maharshi was dying of cancer he resisted the doctors,saying, \u201cIt wants to grow, too. Let it. This is, perhaps, an extreme example of renunciation\u2014not of loveor energy\u2014but of willing right as against wrong, and thus of renouncing one\u2019s own separateness fromeverything that happens, which is what Tillich called \u201cthe courage to be.\u201d","The point, then, is that when we try to understand the present by comparing it with memories, we do not understand it as deeply as when we are aware of it without comparison.","Life is renewed by death because it is again and again set free from what would otherwise become an insufferable burden of memory and monotony. Genuine reincarnation lies in the fact that whenever a child is born \\"I\\" - or human awareness - arises into the world again with memory wiped clean and the wonder of life restored.","I could make a strong, if not conclusive, case for the idea that plants are more intelligent than people\u2014more beautiful, more pacific, more ingenious in their ways of reproduction, more at home in their surroundings, and even more sensitive. Why, we even use flower-forms as our symbols of the divine when the human face reminds us too much of ourselves\u2014the Hindu-Buddhist mandala, the golden lotus, and the Mystic Rose in Dante\u2019s vision of Paradise. Nothing else reminds us so much of a star with a living heart.","Already man uses innumerable gadgets to displace the work done by bodily organs in the animals, and it would surely be in line with this tendency to externalize the reasoning functions of the brain--and thus hand over the government of life to electromagnetic monsters. In other words, the interests and goals of rationality are not those of man as a whole organism. If we are to live for the future, and to make the chief work of the mind prediction and calculation, man must eventually become a parasitic appendage to a mass of clockwork.","All information will come in by super-realistic television and other electronic devices as yet in the planning stage or barely imagined. In one way this will enable the individual to extend himself anywhere without moving his body\u2014even to distant regions of space. But this will be a new kind of individual\u2014an individual with a colossal external nervous system reaching out and out into infinity. And this electronic nervous system will be so interconnected that all individuals plugged in will tend to share the same thoughts, the same feelings, and the same experiences. There may be specialized types, just as there are specialized cells and organs in our bodies. For the tendency will be for all individuals to coalesce into a single bio-electronic body.","Enlightenment is not a reward which one can get. It is something we have in spite of ourselves.","So you could say in a very simple way that the real concern of Zen is to realize\u2014not merely rationally but in one\u2019s bones\u2014that the world inside your skin and the world outside your skin are all one world and one being, one self. And you are it.","For when you have really heard the sound of rain you can hear, and see and feel, everything else in the same way\u2014as needing no translation, as being just that which it is, though it may be impossible to say what. I have tried for years, as a philosopher, but in words it comes out all wrong: in black and white with no color.","This is what is called \\"honor among thieves,\\" for the really dangerous people are those who do not recognize that they are thieves\u2014 the unfortunates who play the role of the \\"good guys\\" with such blind zeal that they are unconscious of any indebtedness to the \\"bad guys\\" who support their status.","Timothy Leary was not so wide of the mark when he said that we must go out of our minds (abstract values) to come to our senses (concrete values). For coming to our senses must, above all, be the experience of our own existence as living organisms rather than \u201cpersonalities, like characters in a play or a novel acting out some artificial plot in which the persons are simply masks for a conflict of abstract ideas or principles. Man as an organism is to the world outside like a whirlpool is to a river: man and world are a single natural process, but we are behaving as if we were invaders and plunderers in a foreign territory.

It gives the accuracy of the water-level, and the philosopher makes it his model. And if water thus derives lucidity from stillness, how much more the faculties of the mind? The mind of the Sage being in repose becomes the mirror of the universe, the speculum of all creation.22 [59a] \xa0 The fluidity of water is not the result of any effort on the part of the water, but is its natural property. And the virtue of the perfect man is such that even without cultivation there is nothing which can withdraw from his sway. Heaven is naturally high, the earth is naturally solid, the sun and moon are naturally bright. Do they cultivate these attributes?23 [63b]","[W]hen our love for others is based simply on mutual need it becomes strangling - a kind of vampirism in which we say, all too expressively, \'I love you so much I could eat you!\' It is from such desiring that parental devotion becomes smother-love and marriage holy deadlock.","For the use of words, and thus of a book, is to point beyond themselves to a world of life and experience that is not mere words or even ideas. Just as money is not real, consumable wealth, books are not life. To idolize scriptures is like eating paper currency.","The real you is not a puppet which life pushes around.","[I]t becomes clearer and clearer that we do not live in a divided world. The harsh divisions of spirit and nature, mind and body, subject and object, controller and controlled, are seen more and more to be awkward conventions of language. These are misleading and clumsy terms for describing a world in which all events seem to be mutually interdependent[.]","Indeed, whoever imagines he has explained Zen has in fact only explained it away; it can no more be bound by a definition than the wind can be shut in a box without ceasing to be wind. Thus any attempt to write on Zen may seem an absurdity from the beginning, but that is only so if either reader or writer imagines that Zen can be contained in a set of ideas. A book about London is in no sense London itself, and no sane person would dream of thinking that it is. Yet apparently intelligent people often make the equally ridiculous mistake of identifying a philosophical system, a dogma, a creed, with Ultimate Truth, imagining that they have found that Truth embraced in a set of propositions which appeals to their reason. There","[T]he part and the whole, the individual and the cosmos, are what they are only in relation to one another.","Tools such as these, as well as the tools of language and thought, are of real use to men only if they are awake -- not lost in the dreamland of past and future, but in the closest touch with that point of experience where reality can alone be discovered: this moment.","How can we bring ourselves into accord with this Tao? A sage has said that if we try to accord with it, we shall get away from it. But he was not altogether right. For the curious thing is that you cannot get out of accord with it even if you want to; though your thoughts may run into the past or the future they cannot escape the present moment. However far back or forward they try to escape they can never be separated from the moment, for those thoughts are themselves of the moment; just as much as anything else they partake of, and, indeed, are the movement of life which is Tao. You may believe yourself out of harmony with life and its eternal Now; but you cannot be, for you are life and exist Now\u2014otherwise you would not be here. Hence the infinite Tao is something which you can neither escape by flight nor catch by pursuit; there is no coming toward it or going away from it; it is, and you are it. So become what you are.","hurry, and all that it involves, is fatal.","The precious\xa0\u2026\xa0uniqueness which the human individual claims is conferred on him not by possession of an immortal soul but by possession of a mortal body.\u2026 If death gives life individuality and if man is the organism which represses death, then man is the organism which represses his own individuality. Norman O. Brown, Life Against Death\u201d","And remember, that it takes as long, to view it or, to listen to it, as it does to do it.","a Chinese poem says: Entering the forest, he does not disturb a blade of grass; Entering the water, he does not cause a ripple. For the image represents a number of qualities which are, in fact, aspects of the same thing. It represents the sage\u2019s freedom and detachment of mind, a skylike consciousness in which experience moves without leaving any stain. As another poem says: The bamboo shadows sweep the stairs, But stir no dust. Yet, paradoxically, this detachment from is also a harmony with, for the man who goes into the forest without disturbing a blade of grass is a man in no conflict with nature. Like the Native American scouts, he walks without a single twig cracking beneath his feet. Like the Japanese architects, he builds a house which seems to be a part of its natural surroundings. The image also represents the fact that the way of the sage cannot be traced and followed, since no authentic wisdom can be imitated. Each man must find it for himself, because there is really no way of putting it into words, of reaching it by any specific methods or directions. But there is actually the most intimate connection between these two apparently separate uses of the metaphor\u2014the way of the sage, on the one hand, and the impermanence of life, on the other. And the connection reveals the one deepest and most central principle of those Asian philosophies which so puzzle the Western mind by identifying the highest wisdom with what, to us, seems the doctrine of abject despair. Indeed, the word despair in a particular sense is the proper translation of the Hindu\u2013Buddhist term nirvana\u2014to \u201cde-spirate, to breathe out, to give up the ghost. We cannot understand how the Asians manage to equate this despair with ultimate bliss\u2014unless, as we are prone to suppose, they are after all a depraved and spineless people, long accustomed to fatalism and resignation.\u201d","There is another story of a Chinese sage who was asked, \\"How shall we escape the heat?\\" -- meaning, of course, the heat of suffering. He answered, \\"Go right into the middle of the fire.\\" \\"But how, then, shall we escape the scorching flame?\\" \\"No further pain will trouble you!\\" We do not need to go as far as China. The same idea comes in The Divine Comedy, where Dante and Virgin find that the way out of Hell lies at its very center.","as Aldous Huxley says, \u201cnews items, mutually irrelevant bits of information, blasts of corybantic or sentimental music, continually repeated doses of drama that bring no catharsis, but merely create a craving for daily or even hourly emotional enemas.","There is a very interesting Hindu teacher by the name of Krishnamurti whom many of you may know about. He tells people that all of their religious inquiry, their yoga practices, their reading religious books, and so on, are nothing but the perpetuation of egocentricity on a very refined and highbrow level. Therefore he encourages disciples who studiously avoid reading any kind of philosophical or edifying book. They are reduced to reading mystery stories and they become devoted nondisciples. What a clever bind that is! It is the same as the Zen technique.","One of the special delights of my childhood was to go and see the cases of illuminated manuscripts in the British Museum, and to walk, as every child can, right into their pages--losing myself in an enchanted world of gold, landscapes and skies whose colours were indwelt with light as if their sun shone not above but in them. Most marvelous of all were the many manuscripts mysteriously entitled \\"Book of Hours\\", since I did not know how one kept hours in a book. Their title-pages and richly ornamented initials showed scenes of times and seasons--ploughing in springtime, formal gardens bright in summer with heraldic roses, autumn harvesting, and logging in winter snow under clear, cold skies seen through a filigree screen of black trees. I could only assume that these books were some ancient device for marking the passage of time and they associated themselves in my mind with sundials in old country yards upon hot afternoons, with the whirring and booming of clocks in towers, with astrolabes engraved with the mysterious signs of the Zodiac, and-above all-with the slow, cyclic sweep of the sun, moon and stars over my head.","This is the situation of everyone who feels that life is a problem to be solved. Whether you seek to solve that problem through psychoanalysis, integration, salvation, or buddhahood, you define yourself in a certain way when you see life as a problem to be solved.","There can be no creative morality unless man has the possibility of freedom. This is where the moralists make their mistake. If they want man to change his way of life, they must assume that he is free, for if he is not, all the raging and protesting in the world will make no difference. On the other hand, a man who is acting from the fear of a moralist\u2019s threats or from the lure of his promises is not making a free act! If man is not free, threats and promises may modify his conduct, but they will not change it in any essential respect. If he is free, threats and promises will not make him use his freedom.","Science and psychotherapy have also done much already to liberate us from the prison of isolation from nature in which we were supposed to renounce Eros, despise the physical organism, and rest all our hopes in a supernatural world [...]. This liberation is, in other words, a very partial affair even for the small minority which has fully understood and accepted it. It leaves us still as strangers in the cosmos-without the judgment of God but without his love, without the terrors of Hell but without the hope of Heaven, without many of the physical agonies of pre-scientific times but without the sense that human life has any meaning.","[T]he ego is the social image or role with which the mind is shamed into identifying itself, since we are taught to act the part which society wants us to play - the part of a reliable and predictable centre of action which resists spontaneous change. But in extreme suffering and death this part cannot be played, and as a result they become associated with all the shame and fear with which, as children, we were forced into becoming acceptable egos. Death and agony are therefore dreaded as loss of status, and their struggles are desperate attempts to maintain the assumed patterns of action and feeling.","At such times we are so aware of the moment that no attempt is made to compare its experience with other experiences.","This recognition of the two-sidedness of the One is what makes the difference between the exoteric and esoteric aspects of a religion, and the latter is always guarded and is alwaysmystical or \'\'closed\'\' [...] because of the danger that the opposites will be confused if their unity is made explicit. It is thus that mysticism is never quite orthodox, never wholly respectable.","you realize that you live in, that indeed you are this moment now, and no other, that apart from this there is no past and no future, you must relax and taste to the full, whether it be pleasure or pain.","If we must be nationalists and have a sovereign state, we cannot also expect to have world peace. If we want to get everything at the lowest possible cost, we cannot expect to get the best possible quality, the balance between the two being mediocrity. If we make it an ideal to be morally superior, we cannot at the same time avoid self-righteousness. If we cling to belief in God, we cannot likewise have faith, since faith is not clinging but letting go.","When you dig sound you realize that the flow or vibration of sound is a way in which you experience basic existence, being here. You can learn everything from sound, because it is not a constant. It comes and goes. It is on and off. You only hear it because it is vibrating. The lesson is that life is on and off, black and white, life and death, inside and outside, knowing and not knowing: they\u2019re all vibrations. It\u2019s easy to explain that in words, but to feel and understand it in your bones you have to learn how to listen to a sound. It was to teach that skill that this system of chanting sounds was invented.","[W]e have never [...] permitted ourselves to be everything that we are, to see that fundamentally all the gains and losses, rights and wrongs of our lives are as natural and \'perfect\' as the peaks and valleys of a mountain range.","The frightened or lonely person begins at once to think, \\"I\'m afraid,\\" or, \\"I\'m lonely.\\" This is, of course, an attempt to avoid the experience. We don\'t want to be aware of this present. But as we cannot get out of the present, our only escape is into memories. Here we feel on safe ground, for the past is the fixed and the known -- but also, of course, the dead.","I assume that maybe you are not serious, but sincere.","expectation rather than the reality of the present is the special trouble of those business men who live entirely to make money. So many people of wealth understand much more about making and saving money than about using and enjoying it. They fail to live because they are always preparing to live. Instead of earning a living they are mostly earning an earning, and thus when the time comes to relax they are unable to do so. Many a \u201csuccessful man is bored and miserable when he retires, and returns to his work only to prevent a younger man from taking his place.\u201d","Listen, there\'s something I must tell. I\'ve never, never seen it so clearly. But it doesn\'t matter a bit if you don\'t understand, because each one of you is quite perfect as you are, even if you don\'t know it. Life is basically a gesture, but no one, no thing, is making it. There is no necessity for it to happen, and none for it to go on happening. For it isn\'t being driven by anything; it just happens freely of itself. It\'s a gesture of motion, of sound, of color, and just as no one is making it, it isn\'t happening to anyone. There is simply no problem of life; it is completely purposeless play - exuberance which is its own end. Basically, there is the gesture. Time, space and multiplicity are complications of it. There is no reason whatsoever to explain it, for explanations are just another form of complexity, a new manifestation of life on top of life, of gestures gesturing. Pain and suffering are simply extreme forms of play, and there isn\'t anything in the whole universe to be afraid of because it doesn\'t happen to anyone! There isn\'t any substantial ego at all. The ego is a kind of flip, a knowing of knowing, a fearing of fearing. It\'s a curlicue, an extra jazz to experience, a sort of double-take or reverberation, a dithering of consciousness which is the same as anxiety.","The natural world gives us many examples of the great effectiveness of this way. The Chinese philosophy of which judo itself is an expression\u2014Taoism\u2014drew attention to the power of water to overcome all obstacles by its gentleness and pliability. It showed how the supple willow survives the tough pine in a snowstorm, for whereas the unyielding branches of the pine accumulate snow until they crack, the springy boughs of the willow bend under its weight, drop the snow, and jump back again. If, when swimming, you are caught in a strong current, it is fatal to resist. You must swim with it and gradually edge to the side. One who falls from a height with stiff limbs will break them, but if he relaxes like a cat he will fall safely. A building without \'give\' in its structure will easily collapse in storm or earthquake, and a car without the cushioning of tires and springs will soon come apart on the road. The mind has just the same powers, for it has give and can absorb shocks like water or a cushion. But this giving way to an opposing force is not at all the same thing as running away. A body of water does not run away when you push it; it simply gives at the point of the push and encloses your hand. A shock absorber does not fall down like a bowling-pin when struck; it gives, and yet stays in the same place. To run away is the only defense of something rigid against an overwhelming force. Therefore the good shock absorber has not only \'give,\' but also stability or \'weight.","Zen does not attempt to be intelligible \u2013 that is, capable of being understood by the intellect. The method of Zen is to baffle, excite, puzzle and exhaust the intellect until it is realized that intellection is only thinking about; it will provoke, irritate and again exhaust the emotions until it is realised that emotion is only feeling about, and then it contrives, when the disciple has been brought to an intellectual and emotional impasse, to bridge the gap between second-hand conceptual contact with reality, and first-hand experience. To effect this it calls into play a higher faculty of the mind, known as intuition or Buddhi, which is sometimes called the \u2018Eye of the Spirit\u2019. In short, the aim of Zen is to focus the attention on reality itself, instead of on our intellectual and emotional reactions to reality \u2014 reality being that ever-changing, ever-growing, indefinable something known as \u201clife, which will never stop for a moment for us to fit it satisfactorily into any rigid system of pigeon-holes and ideas.\u201d","We can hardly begin to consider this problem unless it is clear that the craving for security is itself a pain and a contradiction, and that the more we pursue it, the more painful it becomes. This is true in whatever form security may be conceived. You want to be happy, to forget yourself, and yet the more you try to forget yourself, the more you remember the self you want to forget. You want to escape from pain, but the more you struggle to escape, the more you inflame the agony. You are afraid and want to be brave, but the effort to be brave is fear trying to run away from itself. You want peace of mind, but the attempt to pacify it is like trying to calm the waves with a flat-iron.","Taoism, on the other hand, is generally a pursuit of older men, and especially of men who are retiring from active life in the community. Their retirement from society is a kind of outward symbol of an inward liberation from the bounds of conventional patterns of thought and conduct. For Taoism concerns itself with unconventional knowledge, with the understanding of life directly, instead of in the abstract, linear terms of representational thinking.","I seem to be a brief light that flashes but once in all the aeons of time\u2014a rare, complicated, and all-too-delicate organism on the fringe of biological evolution, where the wave of life bursts into individual, sparkling, and multicolored drops that gleam for a moment only to vanish forever. Under such conditioning it seems impossible and even absurd to realize that myself does not reside in the drop alone, but in the whole surge of energy which ranges from the galaxies to the nuclear fields in my body. At this level of existence \u201cI am immeasurably old; my forms are infinite and their comings and goings are simply the pulses or vibrations of a single and eternal flow of energy.\u201d","No one imagines that a symphony is supposed to improve in quality as it goes along or that the whole object of playing it is to reach the finale. The point of music is discovered in every moment of playing and listening to it. It is the same, I feel, with the greater part of our lives, and if we are unduly absorbed in improving them we may forget altogether to live them.","By trying to understand everything in terms of memory, the past, and words, we have, as it were, had our noses in the guidebook for most of our lives, and have never looked at the view. Whitehead\u2019s criticism of traditional education is applicable to our whole way of living:\'We are too exclusively bookish in our scholastic routine.\u2026 In the Garden of Eden Adam saw the animals before he named them: in the traditional system, children named the animals before they saw them.","One obtains the knowledge of God by discarding concepts","There was never a time when the world began, because it goes round and round like a circle, and there is no place on a circle where it begins. Look at my watch, which tells the","because even then I was ill at ease with the commitment to spiritual imperialism which most Christians feel to be the sine qua non of being Christian, as if one could not be a true Christian without being a militant missionary.","That is why it is so difficult for you and me to find out that we are God in disguise, pretending not to be himself. But when the game has gone on long enough, all of us will wake up, stop pretending, and remember that we are all one single Self\u2014the God who is all that there is and who lives for ever and ever.","If to enjoy even an enjoyable present we must have the assurance of a happy future, we are \u201ccrying for the moon. We have no such assurance. The best predictions are still matters of probability rather than certainty, and to the best of our knowledge every one of us is going to suffer and die.\u201d","they are but men huddling together and shouting to give themselves courage in the dark.","My problem as a writer, using words, is to dispel the illusions of language while employing one of the languages that generates them. I can succeed only on the principle of \u201ca hair of the dog that bit you.","What governs what we choose to notice? The first (which we shall have to qualify later) is whatever seems advantageous or disadvantageous for our survival, our social status, and the security of our egos. The second, again working simultaneously with the first, is the pattern and the logic of all the notation symbols which we have learned from others, from our society and our culture. It is hard indeed to notice anything for which the languages available to us (whether verbal, mathematical, or musical) have no description. This is why we borrow words from foreign languages.","Knowledge is not an encounter between two separate things - a knowing subject and a known object. Knowledge, or better, knowing is a relationship in which knower and known are like the poles in a magnetic field. Human beings are aware of a world because, and only because, it is the sort of world that breeds knowing organisms. Humanity is not one thing and the world another; it has always been difficult for us to see that any organism is so embedded in its environment that the evolution of so complex and intelligent a creature as man could never have come to pass without a reciprocal evolution of the environ\xadment. An intelligent man argues, without any resort to supernaturalism, an intelligent universe.","It seems obvious that the universe is a system which, by means of living bodies, becomes aware of itself\u2014up to a point.","The rift between God and nature would vanish if we knew how to experience nature, because what keeps them apart is not a difference of substance but a split in the mind.","But Jesus had to speak through a public-address system\u2014the only one available\u2014which distorted his words, so that they came forth as the bombastic claim to be the one and only appearance of the Christ, of the incarnation of God as man. This is not good news. The good news is that if Jesus could realize his identity with God, you can also\u2014but this God does not have to be idolized as an imperious monarch with a royal court of angels and ministers. God, as \u201cthe love which moves the sun and other stars, is something much more inward, intimate, and mysterious\u2014in the sense of being too close to be seen as an object.\u201d","There is no greater freedom than the freedom to be what you are now.","We fail so easily to see the difference between fear of the unknown and respect for the unknown, thinking that those who do not hasten in with bright lights and knives are deterred by a holy and superstitious fear. Respect for the unknown is the attitude of those who, instead of raping nature, woo her until she gives herself. But what she gives, even then, is not the cold clarity of the surface but the warm inwardness of the body - a mysteriousness which is not merely a negation, a blank absence of knowledge, but that positive substance which we call wonderfull.","Every in group distinguishes itself from the outgroup by some process of \\"going through the mill\\" or enduring sufferings which are subsequently worn as the proud badge of graduation","There is an interdependence of flowers and bees. Where there are no flowers there are no bees, and where there are no bees there are no flowers. They\u2019re really one organism. And so in the same way, everything in nature depends on everything else.So it\u2019s interconnected! And so the many many patterns of interconnections lock it in together into a unity, which is, however, much too complicated for us to think about.","Briefly, this doctrine is that man suffers because of his craving to possess and keep for ever things which are essentially impermanent. Chief among these things is his own person, for this is his means of isolating himself from the rest of life, his castle into which he can retreat and from which he can assert himself against external forces. He believes that this fortified and isolated position is the best means of obtaining happiness; it enables him to fight against change, to strive to keep pleasing things for himself, to shut out suffering and to shape circumstances as he wills. In short, it is his means of resisting life. The","The whole history of religion is the history of the failure of preaching. Preaching is moral violence.","Harry Emerson Fosdick could write a book called On Being a Real Person, which translated literally is, \u201cHow to be a genuine fake, because in the old sense, the person is the role, the part played by the actor. But if you forget that you are the actor, and think you are the person, you have been taken in by your own role. You are \u201cen-rolled,\u201d or bewitched, spellbound, enchanted.\u201d","Trying to pretend to oneself that a life of constant self frustration was in fact a great spiritual attainment.","Matter is spirit named.","[T]he function of the brain is to serve the present and the real, not to send man chasing wildly after the phantom of the future.","Action without wisdom, without clear awareness of the world as it really is, can never improve anything.","It is simply being aware of this present experience, and realizing that you can neither define it nor divide yourself from it.","This is why I am not overly enthusiastic about the various \u201cspiritual exercises in meditation or yoga which some consider essential for release from the ego. For when practiced in order to \u201cget\u201d some kind of spiritual illumination or awakening, they strengthen the fallacy that the ego can toss itself away by a tug at its own bootstraps. But there is nothing wrong with meditating just to meditate, in the same way that you listen to music just for the music. If you go to concerts to \u201cget culture\u201d or to improve your mind, you will sit there as deaf as a doorpost.\u201d","While it is true that these arts employ what are, to us, highly difficult technical disciplines, it is always recognized that they are instrumental and secondary, and that superior work has the quality of an accident.","Not long ago Congress voted, with much patriotic rhetoric, for the imposition of severe penalties upon anyone presuming to burn the flag of the United States. Yet the very Congressmen who passed this law are responsible, by acts of commission or omission, for burning, polluting, and plundering the territory that the flag is supposed to represent. Therein, they exemplified the peculiar andperhaps fatal fallacy of civilization: the confusion of symbol with reality.","[A]ny system which leaves the individual upon one horn of the dualistic dilemma is at best the achievement of courageous despair.","Jinsei nana korobi Ya oki. Such is life\u2013 Seven times down, Eight times up!","The reality of money is of the same type as the reality of centimeters, grams, hours, or lines of longitude. Money is a way of measuring wealth but is not wealth in itself. A chest of gold coins or a fat wallet of bills is of no use whatsoever to a wrecked sailor alone on a raft. He needs real wealth, in the form of a fishing rod, a compass, an outboard motor with gas, and a female companion.","In a universe whose fundamental principle is relativity rather than warfare there is no purpose because there is no victory to be won, no end to be attained. For every end, as the world itself shows, is an extreme, an opposite, and exists only in relation to it other end. Because the world is not going anywhere there is no hurry. One may as well \\"take it easy\\" like nature itself [...].","There is, then, the feeling that we live in a time of unusual insecurity. In the past hundred years so many long-established traditions have broken down\u2014traditions of family and social life, of government, of the economic order, and of religious belief. As the years go by, there seem to be fewer and fewer rocks to which we can hold, fewer things which we can regard as absolutely right and true, and fixed for all time.","For the perishability and changefulness of the world is part and parcel of its liveliness and loveliness.","As a matter of fact, our age is no more insecure than any other. Poverty, disease, war, change, and death are nothing new. In the best of times \u201csecurity has never been more than temporary and apparent. But it has been possible to make the insecurity of human life supportable by belief in unchanging things beyond the reach of calamity\u2014in God, in man\u2019s immortal soul, and in the government of the universe by eternal laws of right.\u201d","You don\u2019t listen to a song to get to the end of it, you listen to enjoy the song as a whole.","Since opposed principles, or ideologies, are irreconcilable, wars fought over principle will be wars of mutual annihilation. But wars fought for simple greed will be far less destructive, because the aggressor will be careful not to destroy what he is fighting to capture. Reasonable\u2013that is, human\u2013men will always be capable of compromise, but men who have dehumanized themselves by becoming the blind worshipers of an idea or an ideal are fanatics whose devotion to abstractions makes them the enemies of life.","Here is a person who knows that in two weeks\' time he has to undergo a surgical operation. In the meantime he is feeling no physical pain; he has plenty to eat; he is surrounded by friends and human affection; he is doing work that is normally of great interest to him. But his power to enjoy these things is taken away by constant dread. He is insensitive to the immediate realities around him. His mind is preoccupied with something that is not yet here. It is not as if he were thinking about it in a practical way, trying to decide whether he should have the operation or not, or making plans to take care of his family and his affair if he should die. These decisions have already been made. Rathre, he is thinking about the operation in an entirely futile way, which both ruins his present enjoyment of life an dcontributes nothing to the solution of any problem. But he cannot help himself.","If it is true that \u201cwhen the wrong man uses the right means, the right means work in the wrong way, it is often also true that when the right man uses the wrong means, the wrong means work in the right way.\u201d","the relationship between the organism and the environment is transactional\u2014the environment grows the organism, and the organism creates the environment. The organism turns the sun into light, but it requires an environment containing a sun in order to exist. It\u2019s all one process. It isn\u2019t that organisms came into this world by accident or chance\u2014this world is the sort of environment that grows organisms. And it has been that way from the beginning.

This cannot happen if one does not practice constantly. But neither can it happen if one makes an effort.","We suffer from a hallucination, from a false and distorted sensation of our own existence as living organisms. Most of us have the sensation that \\"I myself\\" is a separate center of feeling and action, living inside and bounded by the physical body \u2014 a center which \\"confronts\\" an \\"external\\" world of people and things, making contact through the senses with a universe both alien and strange.","This wave phenomenon is happening on ever so many scales\u2014the fast wave of light, the slower waves of sound\u2014and there are all sorts of other wave processes, such as the beat of the heart; the rhythm of breath, waking, sleeping; the movement of human life from birth to maturity to death. And the slower the wave goes, the more difficult it is to see that the crest and trough are inseparable, and this is how we become persuaded in the game of hide-and-seek. So we see the trough go down, down, down and think it keeps going forever\u2014that it will never rise back up again into a crest. We forget that trough implies crest, and crest implies trough. There is no such thing as pure sound\u2014sound is sound/silence. Light is light/darkness. Light is pulsation\u2014between every light pulse there is the dark pulse.","Even when robbed he is still rich, for The thief Left it behind\u2013 The moon at the window.","However, when you say to yourself, \u201cI must go on living, you put yourself in a double bind because you submit to a process which is essentially spontaneous and then insist it must happen.\u201d","This is the greatness of human consciousness, but at the same time it is always posing the practical problem of how to live upon the lower level when one\'s understanding reaches to the higher. For if we discover that there is some superior order harmonizing what seem to be conflicts at the level of our normal, individual consciousness, may not this new understanding upset our standards and weaken the will to fight? If we see that the Good of the world is not the victory of\xb7 good over evil but, on the contrary, the tense polarity of good-and-evil in perpetual conflict, is it not possible that this will lead us to a recognition of the function of evil making it difficult for us to fight and hate it?","There emerges, then, a view of life which sees its worth and point not as a struggle for constant ascent but as a dance. Virtue and harmony consist, not in accentuating the positive, but in maintaining a dynamic balance.","Although the rhythm of the waves beats a kind of time, it is not clock or calendar time. It has no urgency. It happens to be timeless time. It harmonizes with our very breathing. It does not count our days. Its pulse is not in the stingy spirit of measuring, it is the breathing of eternity.","Life & love generate effort, but effort will not generate them.","Recollection \u2014 or the practice of the presence of God. The ideal is to have this running constantly through the day. The point is not to try to feel God\u2019s presence but to recollect that, like the present moment, you cannot get away from it even if you try.","On the one hand, to withdraw is a separative and thus essentially selfish position. On the other, to choose not to play rather than to play is still to choose, and thus to remain in duality. Therefore the most truly awakened sages are represented as coming back to participate in the life of the world out of \'\'compassion for all sentient beings,\'\' playing the game of good against evil, success against failure, in the full knowledge that it is a game [.]","The idea that there are no wrong feelings is immensely threatening to people who are afraid to feel. This is one of the peculiar problems of Western culture: We are terrified of our feelings, because they take off on their own. We think that if we give them any scope, if we don\u2019t immediately beat them down, they will lead us into all kinds of chaotic and destructive actions.","Those who know do not speak; Those who speak do not know.","I am depressed, and want to get \u201cI out of this depression. The opposite of depression is elation, but because depression is not elation, I cannot force myself to be elated. I can, however, get drunk. This makes me wonderfully elated, and so when the next depression arrives, I have a quick cure. The subsequent depressions have a way of getting deeper and blacker, because I am not digesting the depressed state and eliminating its poisons. So I need to get even drunker to drown them. Very soon I begin to hate myself for getting so drunk, which makes me still more depressed\u2014and so it goes.\u201d","We do not easily grasp the point that the void is creative, and that being comes from nonbeing as sound from silence and light from space.","People imagine that letting themselves go would have disastrous results; trusting neither circumstances nor themselves, which together make up life, they are forever interfering and trying to make their own souls and the world conform with preconceived patterns. This interference is simply the attempt of the ego to dominate life.","He has a funny look in his eyes as if to say, \u201cCome off it, Shiva, I know what you are up to, I know what you are doing. And you say, \u201cWhat, me?\u201d So he looks at you in this funny way until finally you get the feeling that he sees all the way through you; and that all your selfishness and evil, nasty thoughts are transparent to his gaze. Then you have to try and alter them. He suggests that you practice the control of the mind, that you become interiorly silent, and that you give up selfish desires of the skin-encapsulated self. Then you may have some success in quieting your mind and in concentrating. But after that, he will throw a curve at you, which is: Are you not still desiring not to desire? Why are you trying to be unselfish? Well, the answer is, \u201cI want to be on the side of the big battalions. I think it is going to pay off better to be unselfish than to be selfish.\u201d","We seldom realize, for example, that our most private thoughts and emotions are not actually our own. For we think in terms of languages and images which we did not invent, but which were given to us by our society. We copy emotional reactions from our parents, learning from them that excrement is supposed to have a disgusting smell and that vomiting is supposed to be an unpleasant sensation. The dread of death is also learned from their anxieties about sickness and from their attitudes to funerals and corpses. Our social environment has this power just because we do not exist apart from a society. Society is our extended mind and body.","All perfect accomplishment in art or life is accompanied by the curious sensation that it is happening of itself - that it is not forced, studied, or contrived. Thos is not to say that everything which is felt to happen of itself is a perfect accomplishment; the marvel of human spontaneity is that it has developed the means of self-discipline - which becomes repressive only when it is felt that the controlling agent is separate from the action. But the sensation that the action is happening of itself, neither from an agent nor to a witness, is the authentic sensation of life as pure process, in which there is neither mover nor moved. Process without source or destination, verb without subject or object - this is not deprivation, a the word \\"without\\" suggests, but the \\"musical\\" sensation of arriving at every moment in which the melody and rhythm unfold.","I have sometimes thought that all philosophical disputes could be reduced to an argument between the partisans of \u201cprickles and the partisans of \u201cgoo.\u201d The prickly people are tough-minded, rigorous, and precise, and like to stress differences and divisions between things. They prefer particles to waves, and discontinuity to continuity. The gooey people are tender-minded romanticists who love wide generalizations and grand syntheses. They stress the underlying unities, and are inclined to pantheism and mysticism. Waves suit them much better than particles as the ultimate constituents of matter, and discontinuities jar their teeth like a compressed-air drill.\u201d","The whole problem is that it would be very bad indeed if God were the author of evil, and we were his victims. That is to say, if we keep the model of the king of the universe in which the creatures are all subjects of the king, then a God who is responsible for evil is being very unkind to the people. But in the Hindu theory, God is not another person. There are no victims of God. He is never anything but His own victim. You are responsible. If you want to stay in the state of illusion, stay in it. But you can always wake up.","For there is no joy in continuity, in the perpetual. We desire it only because the present is empty. A person who is trying to eat money is always hungry. When someone says, \\"Time to stop now!\\" he is in a panic because he has had nothing to eat yet, and wants more and more time to go on eating money, ever hopeful of satisfaction around the corner. We do not really want continuity, but rather a present experience of total happiness. The though of wanting such an experience to go on and on is a result of being self-conscious in the experience, and thsu incompletely aware of it. So long as there is the feeling of an \\"I\\" having this experience, the moment is not all. Eternal life is realized when the last trace of difference between \\"I\\" and \\"now\\" has vanished - when there is just this \\"now\\" and nothing else.By contrast, hell or \\"everlasting damnation\\" is not the everlastingness of time going on forever, but of the unbroken circle, the continuity and frustration of going round and round in pursuit of something which can never be attained. Hell is the fatuity, the everlasting impossibility, of self-love, self-consciousness, and seld-possession. It is trying to see one\xb4s own eyes, hear one\xb4s own ears, and kiss one\xb4s own lips.","In certain natures, the conflict between social convention and repressed spontaneity is so violent that it manifests itself in crime, insanity, and neurosis, which are the prices we pay for the otherwise undoubted benefits of order.","English the differences between things and actions are clearly, if not always logically, distinguished, but a great number of Chinese words do duty for both nouns and verbs\u2013so that one who thinks in Chinese has little difficulty in seeing that objects are also events, that our world is a collection of processes rather than entities.","However, until there is silence of the mind, it is almost impossible to understand eternal life, that is to say, eternal now.","[T]here is some other way of understanding and getting along with the process of nature than by translating it into words. After all, the brain, the very organ of intelligence, defies linguistic description by even the greatest neurologists.","When someone is in some kind of social or psychological difficulty, and someone has been irresponsible in some way, we wonder what caused the problem: \u201cWhy are they like that? And instead of attributing the problem to the person, our psychologists tend to refer it back to other things and other people: It was because of their environment, or because of family conditioning, or because of their father and mother. But there is no end to that, because you can take the blame straight back to Adam and Eve! And responsibility is evaded, because it was limited in the first place.\u201d","... for as the reality of light cannot be proved or described in terms of visible shape, the reality of the infinite cannot be proved in terms of the finite. For this reason every attempt to prove the existence of God by logic is a foregone failure. Logic cannot reach God. It may travel backwards in time from effect to cause, effect to cause, but as long as it stays in time, as it must, it cannot touch the eternal. That which doesn\'t not begin with the infinite cannot end with it.","Why do we love nonsense?

Why is it that all those old English songs are full of \u201cFal-de-riddle-eye-do\u201d and \u201cHey-nonny-nonny\u201d and all those babbling choruses? Why is it that when we get \u201chep\u201d with jazz we just go \u201cBoody-boody-boop-de-boo\u201d and so on, and enjoy ourselves swinging with it? It is this participation in the essential glorious nonsense that is at the heart of the world, not necessarily going anywhere. It seems that only in moments of unusual insight and illumination that we get the point of this, and find that the true meaning of life is no meaning, that its purpose is no purpose, and that its sense is non-sense. Still, we want to use the word \u201csignificant.\u201d Is this significant nonsense? Is this a kind of nonsense that is not just chaos, that is not just blathering balderdash, but rather has in it rhythm, fascinating complexity, and a kind of artistry? It is in this kind of meaninglessness that we come to the profoundest meaning.\u201d","At each moment the mystic accepts the whole of his experience, including himself as he is, his circumstances as they are, and the relationship between them as it is. Wholeness is his keyword; his acceptance is total, and he excludes no part of his experience, however unsavory it may be.","What we have forgotten is that thoughts and words are conventions, and that it is fatal to take conventions too seriously.","W might \'conquer\' nature if we could first, or at the same time, conquer our own nature, though we do not see that human nature and \'outside\' nature are all of a piece.","1/7 of your life should be madness","The effects of what are now called psychedelic (mind\u2013manifesting) chemicals differ from those of alcohol as laughter differs from rage or delight from depression. There is really no analogy between being \u201chigh on LSD and \u201cdrunk\u201d on bourbon. True, no one in either state should drive a car, but neither should one drive while reading a book, playing a violin, or making love. Certain creative activities and states of mind demand a concentration and devotion which are simply incompatible with piloting a death\u2013dealing engine along a highway.\u201d","Man can never understand his freedom while he regards himself as the mere instrument of fate or while he limits his freedom to whatever he his ego can do to snatch from life the prizes which it desires. To be free man must see himself and life as a whole, not as active power and passive instrument but as two aspects of a single activity.","The hostile attitude of conquering nature ignores the basic interdependence of all things and events - that the world beyond the skins is actually an extension of our own bodies - and will end in destroying the very environment form which we emerge and upon which our whole life depends","[T]he world as described is included in but is not the same as the world as it is. As a way of contemplation, it is being aware of life without thinking about it, and then carrying this on even while one is thinking, so that thoughts are not confused with nature.","In having a flawed sense of identity, we act in a way that is inappropriate to our natural environment.","[T]he chances of survival are best when there is no anxiety to survive, and [...] the greatest power is available to those who do not seek power and who do not use force. To be anxious to survive is to wear oneself out, and to seek power and to use force is to overstrain one\'s system. One is best preserved by floating along without stress.","Because the world is not going anywhere there is no hurry.","To love there must be union with the beloved, but also separation. For love is a creative tension; it is like the string of a musical instrument---a single string yet pulled in opposite directions. If there is too little tension, or if there is too much so that the string breaks, it will give forth no sound. The perfection of love is like the perfect tuning of the string, for love attains fulfillment as there is the maximum of union between two beings who remain definitely separate. Unity in duality is the law of the finite.","You are something that the whole universe is doing in the same way that a wave is something that the whole ocean is doing.","Does it really take any considerable time or effort just to understand that you depend on enemies and outsiders to define yourself, and that without some opposition you would be lost? To see this is to acquire, almost instantly, the virtue of humor, and humor and self-righteousness are mutually exclusive. Humor is the twinkle in the eye of a just judge, who knows that he is also the felon in the dock.","In this respect, the Chinese written language has a slight advantage over our own, and is perhaps symptomatic of a different way of thinking. It is still linear, still a series of abstractions taken in one at a time. But its written signs are a little closer to life than spelled words because they are essentially pictures, and, as a Chinese proverb puts it, \u201cOne showing is worth a hundred sayings. Compare, for example, the ease of showing someone how to tie a complex knot with the difficulty of telling him how to do it in words alone.\u201d","God also likes to play hide-and-seek, but because there is nothing outside God, he has no one but himself to play with. But he gets over this difficulty by pretending that he is not himself. This is his way of hiding from himself.

There is nothing complex about walking, breathing, and circulating one\'s blood. Living organisms have developed these functions without without thinking about them at all.

But at another, \u201cmyth\u201d is a useful and fruitful image by which we make sense of life in somewhat the same way that we can explain electrical forces by comparing them with the behavior of water or air. Yet \u201cmyth,\u201d in this second sense, is not to be taken literally, just as electricity is not to be confused with air or water. Thus in using myth one must take care not to confuse image with fact, which would be like climbing up the signpost instead of following the road.\u201d","What are these substances? Medicines or drugs or sacramental foods? It is easier to say what they are not. They are not narcotics, nor intoxicants, nor energizers, nor anaesthetics, nor tranquilizers. They are, rather, biochemical keys which unlock experiences shatteringly new to most Westerners. For the last two years, staff members of the Center for Research in Personality at Harvard University have engaged in systematic experiments with these substances. Our first inquiry into the biochemical expansion of consciousness has been a study of the reactions of Americans in a supportive, comfortable naturalistic setting. We have had the opportunity of participating in over one thousand individual administrations. From our observations, from interviews and reports, from analysis of questionnaire data, and from pre- and postexperimental differences in personality test results, certain conclusions have emerged. (1) These substances do alter consciousness. There is no dispute on this score. (2) It is meaningless to talk more specifically about the \u201ceffect of the drug. Set and setting, expectation, and atmosphere account for all specificity of reaction. There is no \u201cdrug reaction\u201d but always setting-plus-drug. (3) In talking about potentialities it is useful to consider not just the setting-plus-drug but rather the potentialities of the human cortex to create images and experiences far beyond the narrow limitations of words and concepts. Those of us on this research project spend a good share of our working hours listening to people talk about the effect and use of consciousness-altering drugs. If we substitute the words human cortex for drug we can then agree with any statement made about the potentialities\u2014for good or evil, for helping or hurting, for loving or fearing. Potentialities of the cortex, not of the drug. The drug is just an instrument. In analyzing and interpreting the results of our studies we looked first to the conventional models of modern psychology\u2014psychoanalytic, behavioristic\u2014and found these concepts quite inadequate to map the richness and breadth of expanded consciousness. To understand our findings we have finally been forced back on a language and point of view quite alien to us who are trained in the traditions of mechanistic objective psychology. We have had to return again and again to the nondualistic conceptions of Eastern philosophy, a theory of mind made more explicit and familiar in our Western world by Bergson, Aldous Huxley, and Alan Watts. In the first part of this book Mr. Watts presents with beautiful clarity this theory of consciousness, which we have seen confirmed in the accounts of our research subjects\u2014philosophers, unlettered convicts, housewives, intellectuals, alcoholics. The leap across entangling thickets of the verbal, to identify with the totality of the experienced, is a phenomenon reported over and over by these persons.\u201d","Clear sight has nothing to do with trying to see; it is just the realization that that the eyes will take in every detail all by themselves, for so long as they open they can hardly prevent the light from reaching them.

We took the Christian scriptures that say that everybody is equal in the sight of God and made it to mean that everybody is inferior in the sight of God. And this is a parody of mysticism. Because originally, mysticism meant that, from the standpoint of God, all people are divine, which is a far different thing. So this is why all bureaucracies are rude, why police are rude, why you are made to wait in lines for everything, and why everyone is treated as some kind of crook. And a society like this, that views everybody as inferior, turns quickly into fascism because of its terror of the outsider.","God is the Self of the world, but you can\u2019t see God for the same reason that, without a mirror, you can\u2019t see your own eyes, and you certainly can\u2019t bite your own teeth or look inside your head. Your self is that cleverly hidden because it is God hiding. \u201cYou may ask why God sometimes hides in the form of horrible people, or pretends to be people who suffer great disease and pain.

Sophisticated Hindus do not think of God as a special and separate super-person who rules the world from above, like a monarch. Their God is \u201cunderneath rather than \u201cabove\u201d everything, and he (or it) plays the world from inside.

Still more will this be so if he learns to explore, or feel deeply into, his negative states of feeling - his loneliness, sorrow, grief, depression, or fear - without trying to escape from them.","common error of ordinary religious practice is to mistake the symbol for the reality, to look at the finger pointing the way and then to suck it for comfort rather than follow it.","The child is tricked into the ego-feeling by the attitudes, words, and actions of the society which surrounds him - his parents, relatives, teachers, and, above all, his similarly hoodwinked peers. Other people teach us who we are. Their attitudes to us are the mirror in which we learn to see ourselves, but the mirror is distorted. We are, perhaps, rather dimly aware of the immense power of our social environment. We seldom realize, for example, that our most private thoughts and emotions are not actually our own. For we think in terms of languages and images which we did not invent, but which were given to us by our society. We copy emotional reactions from our parents, learning from them that excrement is supposed to have a disgusting smell and that vomiting is supposed to be an unpleasant sensation. The dread of death is also learned from their anxieties about sickness and from their attitudes to funerals and corpses. Our social environment has this power just because we do not exist apart from a society. Society is our extended mind and body.","A Chinese philosophical work called The Secret of the Golden Flower says that \u201cwhen purpose has been used to achieve purposelessness, the thing has been grasped.","But what our social institutions repress is not just the sexual love, the mutuality, of man and woman, but also the still deeper love of organism and environment, of Yes and No, and of all those so-called opposites represented by the Taoist symbol of the yin-yang, the black and white fishes in eternal intercourse.

This does not mean that he has to engage directly in political revolution; it means that he has to help the individual in liberating himself from various forms of social conditioning, which includes liberation from from hating this conditioning - hatred being a form of bondage to its object.","By trying to understand everything in terms of memory, the past, and words, we have, as it were, had our noses in the guidebook for most of our lives, and have never looked at the view. Whitehead\'s criticism of traditional education is applicable to our whole way of living:\\"We are too exclusively bookish in our scholastic routine... In the Garden of Eden Adam saw the animals before he named them: in the traditional system, children named the animals before they saw them.","De rivieren stromen; de bloemen bloeien; je loopt over straat - nou \xe8n?\'Nou \xe8n? Nou ja, wat wil je nog meer? Hier is iemand die eet uit de kruidenierswinkel en toch nog klaagt dat hij sterft van de honger. Maar het woord en begrip God, Brahman, Tao, of wat je wilt, is eigenlijk ge\xefntroduceerd voor dergelijke ondankbare magen. Het is een manier om het leven te benadrukken door er de aandacht op te vestigen, zoals we woorden onderstrepen of cursief schrijven.","The problem is that the dieticians who actually supervise such \u201ccooking can indeed prove that it contains the proper amount of proteins, carbohydrates, minerals, and vitamins. But this is like judging the worth of music in terms of decibels and wave frequencies. \u201cThis record certified noninjurious to the human ear.\u201d","The ways of liberation are of course concerned with making this so-called mystical consciousness the normal everyday consciousness. [...]. It has nothing to do with a perception of something else than the physical world. On the contrary, it is the clear perception of this world as a field, a perception which is not just theoretical but which is also felt as clearly as we feel, say, that \\"I\\" am a thinker behind and apart from my thoughts, or that the stars are absolutely separate from space and from each other. In this view the differences of the world are not isolated objects encountering one another in conflict, but expressions of polarity. Opposites and differences have something between them, like the two faces of a coin; they do not meet as total strangers. When this relativity of things is seen very strongly, its appropriate affect is love rather than hate or fear.","The fact that happiness is associated with relaxation does not mean that it is impossible to be happy in the midst of strenuous effort, for to be truly effective great effort must, as it were, revolve upon a steady unmoving center. The problem before us is how to find such a center of relaxed balance and poise in man\'s individual life - a center whose happiness is unshaken by the whirl that goes on around it, which creates happiness because of itself and not because of external events, and this in spite of the fact that it may experience those events in all their aspects and extremes from the highest bliss to the deepest agony.","[T]he wisdom of the East has a strictly practical aim which is not mere knowledge about the universe; it aims at a transformation of the individual and of his feeling for life through experience rather than belief. This experience is psychological or spiritual, not metaphysical, and except in certain specialized fields has no relation to occultism or to what we understand in the West as philosophy.","The present situation within and around oneself is Tao, for the present moment is life. Our memory of the past is contained in it as well as the potentiality of the future.","Suffering and death [...] are therefore problematic for the ego rather than the organism. The organism accepts them through ecstasy, but the ego is rigid and unyielding and finds them problematic because they affront its pride.","The Book I am thinking about would not be religious in the usual sense, but it would have to discuss many things with which religions have been concerned\u2014the universe and man\u2019s place in it, the mysterious center of experience which we call \u201cI myself, the problems of life and love, pain and death, and the whole question of whether existence has meaning in any sense of the word. For there is a growing apprehension that existence is a rat-race in a trap: living organisms, including people, are merely tubes which put things in at one end and let them out at the other, which both keeps them doing it and in the long run wears them out. So to keep the farce going, the tubes find ways of making new tubes, which also put things in at one end and let them out at the other. At the input end they even develop ganglia of nerves called brains, with eyes and ears, so that they can more easily scrounge around for things to swallow. As and when they get enough to eat, they use up their surplus energy by wiggling in complicated patterns, making all sorts of noises by blowing air in and out of the input hole, and gathering together in groups to fight with other groups. In time, the tubes grow such an abundance of attached appliances that they are hardly recognizable as mere tubes, and they manage to do this in a staggering variety of forms. There is a vague rule not to eat tubes of your own form, but in general there is serious competition as to who is going to be the top type of tube. All this seems marvelously futile, and yet, when you begin to think about it, it begins to be more marvelous than futile. Indeed, it seems extremely odd.\u201d","[F]ire is not evil because it burns your fingers if you try to catch hold of it; it is only dangerous.","The point is not that one stops choosing, but that one chooses in the knowledge that there is really no choice. [...]It is simply that in a universe of relativity, all choosing, all taking of sides, is playful. But this is not that one feels no urgency. To know the relativity of light and darkness is not to be able to gaze unblinkingly into the sun; to know the relativity of up and down is not to be able to fall upward. To feel urgency without compulsion is the seemingly paradoxical way of describing what it is like for a feeling to arise spontaneously without its happening to a feeler.","Goethe, West-\xf6stlicher Divan. \u201cAs long as you do not know how to die and come to life again, you are but a sorry traveler on this dark earth.","But the obvious truth of the matter is that life is always structured goo, or gooey structure. When analyzed to the limit, structures turn out to be random quanta, a sort of electronic goo. Under the micro\xadscope, goo is a system of minute and rapidly changing structures. Absolute goo or absolute structure would thus be total annihilation, and the same will be true of absolute evil and absolute goodness. These harsh alternatives exist only in the abstract. The real world is rather vibration and alternation, the wave that goes up and down at once.","Ik geloof dat westerse kenners met een christelijke achtergrond het boeddhisme van goede werken nooit echt zullen kunnen begrijpen als ze het niet benaderen via het boeddhisme van vertrouwend geloof, dat zelf zo dicht bij het christelijk geloof staat.","Man makes God in his own image, and as he comes to a clearer and more intelligible view of his own image - changing it in the process - he comes to a more intelligible view of God.","Strictly speaking, these drugs do not impart wisdom at all, any more than the microscope alone gives knowledge. They provide the raw materials of wisdom, and are useful to the extent that the individual can integrate what they reveal into the whole pattern of his behavior and the whole system of his knowledge.","For the individual is almost universally unaware that he has learned to confuse himself with a political and legal fiction, a theory of the individual without physical or biological foundation. His identity is thus a construct built up through years of self-dramatization between himself and his associates, that is, a purely artificial status or role. It is this role which he mistakes for his essential self and that he fears to lose in death, And because the role defines him as a separate individual and an independent agent, his identification with it blinds him to his union with the external world.","If, if we get our heads straight about money, I predict that by ad 2000, or sooner, no one will pay taxes, no one will carry cash, utilities will be free, and everyone will carry a general credit card. This card will be valid up to each individual\u2019s share in a guaranteed basic income or national dividend, issued free, beyond which he may still earn anything more that he desires by an art or craft, profession or trade that has not been displaced by automation. (For detailed information on the mechanics of such an economy, the reader should refer to Robert Theobald\u2019s Challenge of Abundance and Free Men and Free Markets, and also to a series of essays that he has edited, The Guaranteed Income. Theobald is an avant\u2013garde economist on the faculty of Columbia University.)","We can never, never describe all the features of the total situation, not only because every situation is infinitely complex, but also because the total situation is the universe.","Tao and Nirvana are only names for an experience; those who invented them had the experience first and gave it its name afterward, but now people are so busy learning about the names that they forget the experience.","Growth in philosophical understanding, or just plain wisdom, is always a matter of being able to distinguish between levels of truth, and frames of reference, at the same time being able to see one\'s own life in its intimate relation to these differing and ever more universal levels.","Yet as the world becomes more intelligible, it also becomes more mysterious - not, perhaps, in the sense of being problematic and baffling, but of being immeasurably grander, vaster, more complex, and, indeed, more imaginative than we had supposed.","\u0412 \u0434\u0435\u0439\u0441\u0442\u0432\u0438\u0442\u0435\u043b\u044c\u043d\u043e\u0441\u0442\u0438 \u0436\u0435, \u043d\u0435\u0442 \u0432\u043e\u0437\u043c\u043e\u0436\u043d\u043e\u0441\u0442\u0438 \u043e\u0442\u0434\u0435\u043b\u0438\u0442\u044c \u0441\u0435\u0431\u044f \u043e\u0442 \u043c\u0438\u0440\u0430, \u043b\u044e\u0431\u0432\u0438 \u043a \u0441\u0435\u0431\u0435 \u043e\u0442 \u043b\u044e\u0431\u0432\u0438 \u043a \u043a\u043e\u043c\u0443-\u0442\u043e \u0434\u0440\u0443\u0433\u043e\u043c\u0443. \u041b\u044e\u0431\u043e\u0435 \u0437\u043d\u0430\u043d\u0438\u0435 \u043e \u0441\u0435\u0431\u0435 \u044f\u0432\u043b\u044f\u0435\u0442\u0441\u044f \u0437\u043d\u0430\u043d\u0438\u0435\u043c \u043e \u0434\u0440\u0443\u0433\u043e\u043c, \u0430 \u043b\u044e\u0431\u043e\u0435 \u0437\u043d\u0430\u043d\u0438\u0435 \u0434\u0440\u0443\u0433\u043e\u0433\u043e \u2014 \u0437\u043d\u0430\u043d\u0438\u0435\u043c \u043e \u0441\u0435\u0431\u0435. \u2014 \u043d\u0430\u0447\u0438\u043d\u0430\u044e \u0432\u0438\u0434\u0435\u0442\u044c, \u0447\u0442\u043e \u201c\u044f \u0438 \u0434\u0440\u0443\u0433\u043e\u0439, \u0437\u043d\u0430\u043a\u043e\u043c\u043e\u0435 \u0438 \u043d\u0435\u0437\u043d\u0430\u043a\u043e\u043c\u043e\u0435, \u0432\u043d\u0443\u0442\u0440\u0435\u043d\u043d\u0435\u0435 \u0438 \u0432\u043d\u0435\u0448\u043d\u0435\u0435, \u043f\u0440\u0435\u0434\u0441\u043a\u0430\u0437\u0443\u0435\u043c\u043e\u0435 \u0438 \u043d\u0435\u043f\u0440\u0435\u0434\u0441\u043a\u0430\u0437\u0443\u0435\u043c\u043e\u0435 \u2014 \u043f\u043e\u0434\u0440\u0430\u0437\u0443\u043c\u0435\u0432\u0430\u044e\u0442 \u0434\u0440\u0443\u0433 \u0434\u0440\u0443\u0433\u0430.\u201d","Western science has made nature intelligible in terms of its symmetries and regularities, analyzing its most wayward forms into components of a regular and measurable shape.

Christenen geloven in een persoonlijke God en boeddhisten niet, maar wat betreft de ware essentie van religie is dit verschil zo oppervlakkig als het feit dat in het Frans elk zelfstandig naamwoord een geslacht heeft, en in het Engels niet.","The whole situation in and around at this instant is a harmony with which you have to find your own union if you are able to be in accord with Tao. When you have discovered your own union with it, you will be in the state of Te, sometimes rendered as \\"virue\\" or \\"grace\\" or \\"power,\' but best understood as Tao realized in man.","that the more we struggle for life (as pleasure), the more we are actually killing what we love.","[L]ife and death are in conflict only in the mind which creates a war between them out of its own desires and fears. In fact life and death are not opposed but complementary, being the two essential factors of a greater life that is made up of living and dying just as melody is produced by the sounding and silencing of individual notes.","Nu exist\u0103 niciodat\u0103 altceva dec\xe2t prezentul, \u0219i dac\u0103 cineva nu poate tr\u0103i \xeen el, nu poate tr\u0103i nic\u0103ieri.","If, then, we are to be fully human and fully alive and aware, it seems that we must be willing to suffer for our pleasures.","[W]u-wei means \\"nondoing\\" simply in the sense that by no action of our own can we bring ourselves into harmony with Tao, for [...] the secret of this harmony in the moment is not action but acceptance of a harmony already achieved by Tao itself. We do not alter the actual situation; but our attitude toward it undergoes a change whereby we feel harmony where before we felt discord.","The power of memories and expectations is such that for most human beings the past and the future are not as real, but more real than the present. The present cannot be lived happily unless the past has been \u201ccleared up","it has been possible to make the insecurity of human life supportable by belief in unchanging things beyond the reach of calamity\u2014in God, in man\u2019s immortal soul, and in the government of the universe by eternal laws of right. Today","But it is not that you are something which is just watching what happens. \u201cWhat happens is just using your organism to watch itself. It is the universe centering as a particular being, though it is not necessary to use or insist on this concept, for what is important here is not the idea but the feeling of it. The words are only a special use of noises in the air, marks on paper, or vibrations in the brain.\u201d","It is open to all of us in so far as \\"the mastery of life is not a problem to be solved, but a reality to be experienced.\\" It is given to many to be seers, but few to be prophets. Many can listen to music, but few can perform and compose.","[C]hange is not merely a force of destruction. Every form is really a pattern of movement, and every living thing is like the river, which, if it did not flow out, would never have been able to flow in. Life and death are not two opposed forces; they are simply two ways of looking at the same force, for the movement of change is as much the builder as the destroyer. The human body lives because it is a complex of motions, of circulation, respiration, and digestion. To resist change, to try to cling to life, is therefore like holding your breath: if you persist you kill yourself.In thinking of ourselves as divided into \u201cI and \u201cme,\u201d we easily forget that consciousness also lives because it is moving. It is as much a part and product of the stream of change as the body and the whole natural world. If you look at it carefully, you will see that consciousness\u2014 the thing you call \u201cI\u201d\u2014 is really a stream of experiences, of sensations, thoughts, and feelings in constant motion. But because these experiences include memories, we have the impression that \u201cI\u201d is something solid and still, like a tablet upon which life is writing a record.Yet the \u201ctablet\u201d moves with the writing finger as the river flows along with the ripples, so that memory is like a record written on water\u2014 a record, not of graven characters, but of waves stirred into motion by other waves which are called sensations and facts.\u201d","[W]hat is ordinarily felt as the wayward, unpredictable, dangerous, and even hostile world - including one\'s capricious emotions and inner feelings - is actually one\'s own being and doing. The very sense that this is not so is, in turn, part of its being so,","[T]he soul or personality lives just to the degree that it does not withdraw, that it does not shrink from the full implications of of being one with the body and with the whole realm of natural experience. For although this seems to suggest the absorption of man into the flux of nature, the integrity of personality is far better preserved by the faith of self-giving than the shattering anxiety of self-preservation.","If everything that exists is an action of God, he must have an alarming humility, since he is not above employing his whole being to produce an ordinary housefly.","If we are to abandon Newtonian mechanics in the physical sphere we must also do so in the psychological and moral. In the same measure that the atoms are not billiard balls struck into motion by others, our actions are not entities forced into operation by distinct motives and drives. Actions appear to be forced by other things to the degree that the agent identifies himself with a single part of the situation in which the actions occur, such as the will as distinct from the passions, or the mind as distinct from the body. But if he identifies himself with his passions and with his body, he will not seem to be moved by them. If he can go further and see that he is not simply his body but the whole of his body-environment relationship, he will not even feel forced to act by the environment.","[L]ife is a system of geological and biological cooperation. Certainly, the system contains fights: birds against worms, snails against lettuce, and spiders against flies. But these fights are contained in the sense that they do not get out of hand, that no one species is the permanent victor. Man alone is trying to eliminate his natural enemies in the conviction that he is, or should be, the supreme species.","If, then, man is to rediscover his own image in the macroscopic and microscopic worlds which science reveals, this will be the \\"own image\\" in which God is said to have created him[.]","as if one were trying to describe the color of a mirror in terms of colors reflected in the mirror","[T]he soul or personality lives just to the degree that it does not withdraw, that it does not shrink from the full implications of being one with the body and with the whole realm of natural experience.

The human organism has the most wonderful powers of adaptation to both physical and psychological pain. But these can only come into full play when the pain is not being constantly restimulated by this inner effort to get away from it, to separate the \\"I\\" from the feeling. The effort creates a state of tension in which the pain thrives.","The effect appears to be controlled passively by its cause only in so far as it is considered to be distinct from the cause. But if cause and effect are just the terms of a single act, there is neither controller nor controlled. Thus the feeling that action has to spring from necessity comes from thinking that the self is the centre of consciousness as distinct from the periphery.","Trying to explain Zen is like trying to catch wind in a box; the moment you the lid it ceases to be wind and in time becomes stagnant air.","The cosmos is seel as a multi-dimensional network of crystals, each one containing the reflections of all the others, and the reflections of all the others in those reflections... In the heart of each there shines, too, the single point of light that every one reflects from every other.","Zen concentrates on the importance of seeing into one\'s own nature now at this moment - not in five minutes when you have had time to \\"accept\\" yourself, nor ten years ahead when you have had time to retire to the mountains and meditate.","This willful, compulsive, moralistic approach to man\u2019s transformation always obstructs it\u2014for it still implies that very illusion of self-mastery which stands in the way. But it is just when I discover that I cannot surrender myself that I am surrendered; just when I find that I cannot accept myself that I am accepted.","For so sensitive a creature as man, art is natural. He does not care to masticate raw beef with hands and teeth, nor to make love with the same \'natural\' unconcern as that with which he sneezes, nor to live in homes thrown together anyhow to keep out the wet and cold. Therefore there is almost always an art of love, whether it be as directly concerned with the sexual act as the Indian Kuma Sutra, or a preoccupation with the long preliminaries of wooing to which the sexual act itself is merely the final swift climax.","[O]ur feelings are not fixed, unrelated states, but slowly or rapidly swinging motions such that a perpetuity of joy would be as meaningless as the notion of swinging only to the right.","The proper meaning of \\"theory\\" is not idle speculation but vision, and it was rightly said that \\"where there is no vision the people perish.\\"But vision in this sense does not mean dreams and ideals for the future. It means understanding of life as it is, of what we are, and what we are doing.","Sitting meditation is not, as is often supposed, a \\"spiritual exercise,\\" a practice followed for for some ulterior object. From a Buddhist standpoint, it is simply the proper way to sit, and it seems perfectly natural to remain sitting so long as there is nothing else to be done, and so long as one is not consumed with nervous agitation. To the restless temperament of the West sitting meditation may seem to be an unpleasant discipline, because we do not seem to be able to sit \\"just to sit\\" without qualms of conscience, without feeling that we ought to be doing something more important to justify our existence. To propitiate this restless conscience, sitting meditation must therefore be regarded as an exercise, a discipline with an ulterior motive. Yet at that very point it ceases to be meditation (dhyana) in the Buddhist sense, for where there is purpose, where there is seeking and grasping for results, there is no dhyana.","Accustomed, as it is, to think of man as a dualism of mind and body, and to regard the former as \\"sensible\\" and the latter as a \\"dumb\\" animal, our cultture is an affront to the wisdom of nature and a ruinous exploitation of the human organism as a whole.","We must repeat: memory, thought, language, and logic are essential to human life. They are one half of sanity. But a person, a society, which is only half sane is insane. To look at life without words is not to lose the ability to form words\u2014to think, remember, and plan. To be silent is not to lose your tongue. On the contrary, it is only through silence that one can discover something new to talk about. One who talked incessantly, without stopping to look and listen, would repeat himself ad nauseam.","Moreover, there is no \u201cunconscious mind distinct from the conscious, for the \u201cunconscious\u201d mind is conscious, though not of itself, just as the eyes see but do not see themselves.\u201d","We learn nothing of very much importance when it can be explained entirely in terms of past experience. If it were possible to understand all things in terms of what we know already, we could convey the sense of color to a blind man with nothing but sound, taste, touch, and smell.","It is in vain that doctors prolong life if we spend the extra time being anxious to live still longer.","[I]f we think of spirituality less in terms of what it avoids and more in terms of what it is positively, and if we may think of it as including an intense awareness of the inner identity of subject and object, man and the universe, there is no reason whatsoever why it should require the rejection of sexuality. On the contrary, this most intimate of relationships of the self with another would naturally become on of the chief spheres of spiritual insight and growth.","Faith has no preconceptions; it is a plunge into the unknown. Belief clings, but faith lets go. In this sense of the word, faith is the essential virtue of science, and likewise of any religion that is not self-deception.","What do you mean by happiness? What are \\"better\\" people better for? About what will you co-operate? What will you do with peace and prosperity?","[T]he less I preach, the more likely I am to be heard.","You want to escape from pain, but the more you struggle to escape, the more you inflame the agony. You are afraid and want to be brave, but the effort to be brave is fear trying to run away from itself.","wonder is not a disease. Wonder, and its expression in poetry and the arts, are among the most important things which seem to distinguish men from other animals, and intelligent and sensitive people from morons. Is","The fear that self-acceptance necessarily annihilates ethical judgment is groundless, for we are perfectly able to distinguish between up and down at any point on the earth\'s surface, realizing at the same time that there is no up and down in the larger framework of the cosmos. Self-acceptance is therefore the spiritual and psychological equivalent of space, a freedom of which does not annihilate distinctions but makes them possible.","If we can really understand what we\'re looking for -- that safety is isolation, and what we do to ourselves when we look for it -- we shall see that we do not want it at all.","Sexuality will remain a problem so long as it continues to be the isolated area in which the individual transcends himself and experiences spontaneity. He must first allow himself to be spontaneous in the whole play of inner feeling and of sensory response to the everyday world. Only as the senses in general can learn to accept without grasping, or to be conscious without straining, can the special sensations of sex be free from the grasping of abstract lust and its inseparable twin, the inhibition of abstract or \'spiritual\' disgust.","[T]he world is a system of inseparable relationships and not a mere juxtaposition of things. The verbal, piecemeal and analytic mode of perception has blinded us to the fact that things and events do not exist apart from each other. The world is a whole greater than the sum of its parts because the parts are not merely summed - thrown together - but related. The whole is a pattern which remains, while the parts come and go, just as the human body is a dynamic pattern which persists despite the rapid birth and death of all its individual cells. The pattern does not, of course, exist disembodiedly apart from individual forms, but exists precisely through their coming and going - just as it is through the structured motion and vibration of its electrons that a rock has solidity.","The divided mind comes to the dinner table and pecks at one dish after another, rushing on without digesting anything to find one better than the last. It finds nothing good, because there is nothing which it really tastes.","[I]n nature being and nothing, or solid and space, constitute a relationship as inseparable as back and front. In the same way, the formally static character of our words for feelings conceals the fact (or better, the event) that our feelings are directions rather than states, and that in the realm of direction there is no North without South.","To hate death and change is trying to make life deathless and changeless, and this is rigid. moribund, living death","[T]he possession of a body is not a relationship to a person; one is related to the person only in being related to the organism of another in its total functioning. For the human being is not a thing but a process, not an object but a life.","The principle thing is to understand that there is no safety or security. One of the worst vicious circles is the problem of the alcoholic. In very many cases he knows quite clearly that he is destroying himself, that, for him, liquor is poison, that he actually hates being drunk, and even dislikes the taste of liquor. And yet he drinks. For, dislike it as he may, the experience of not drinking is worse.","Sorrow can only be compared with the memory of joy, which is not at all the same thing as joy itself. Like words, memories never really succeed in \\"catching\\" reality.","Once upon a time there was a lunatic who used to pass the time by sitting in a corner and beating himself on the head with a brick. When asked the reason for this interesting behavior he replied, \u201cWell, it feels so pleasant when I stop.","Understanding comes through awareness. Can we, then, approach our experience -- our sensations, feelings, and thoughts -- quite simply, as if we had never known them before, and, without prejudice, look at what\'s going on?","Therefore, if reason grows out of the primal energy that we are, then it means that the primal energy is at least reasonable, whatever else it may be. You can tell the tree by its fruits \u2014 for \u201cby their fruits you shall know them \u2014 and so it is that figs do not grow on thistles, or grapes on thorns, and a stupid universe does not create people. People are a manifestation of the potentiality in the energy of the universe, and if we are intelligent, then that which we express is also intelligent. By logical extension, that in which we express it is our central self. The world is not something external; it is what is most fundamentally you.\u201d","An ardent Jehovah\u2019s Witness once tried to convince me that if there were a God of love, he would certainly provide mankind with a reliable and infallible textbook for the guidance of conduct. I replied that no considerate God would destroy the human mind by making it so rigid and unadaptable as to depend upon one book, the Bible, for all the answers. For the use of words, and thus of a book, is to point beyond themselves to a world of life and experience that is not mere words or even ideas. Just as money is not real, consumable wealth, books are not life. To idolize scriptures is like eating paper currency.","[W]hen we think about our feelings, we tend to represent them as fixed states. Such words as anger, depression, fear, grief, anxiety and guilt suggest uniform states which tend to persist if no action is taken to change or release them. [...] [W]e still think of negative feelings as disorders of the mind which need to be cured. But what needs to be cured is the inner resistance to those feelings which moves us to dissipate them in precipitate action. To resist the feeling is to be unable to contain it long enough for it to work itself out.","Civilized people, whether Western or Eastern,need to be liberated and dehypnotized from their systems of symbolism and, thereby, become moreintensely aware of the living vibrations of the real world. For lack of such awareness ourconsciousnesses and consciences have become calloused to the daily atrocities of burning children withnapalm, of saturation bombing of fertile earth with all its plants, wild animals, and insects (not to mentionpeople), and of manufacturing nuclear and chemical weapons concerning which the real problem is not somuch how to prevent their use as how to get them off the face of the earth.","If the mind is the directive force behind action, the mind and its vision of life must be healed before action can be anything but conflict.Something must therefore be said about the healed vision of life which comes with full awareness, for it involves a deep transformation of our view of the world. As well as words can describe it, this transformation consists in knowing and feeling that the world is an organic unity.","To give free rein to the course of feeling is therefore to observe it without interference, recognizing that because feeling is motion it is not to be understood in terms which imply not static states but judgments of good and bad.","Resistance disappears and the balancing process comes into full effect not by intention on the part of the subject, but only as it is seen that the feeling of being the subject, the ego, is itself part of the stream of experience and does not stand outside it in a controlling position.","In sum, then, te is the unthinkable ingenuity and creative power of man\u2019s spontaneous and natural functioning\u2013a power which is blocked when one tries to master it in terms of formal methods and techniques.","Nevertheless, the physical reality is that my body exists only in relation to this universe, and in fact I am as attached to it and dependent on it as a leaf on a tree. I feel cut off only because I am split within myself, because I try to be divided from my own feelings and sensations. What I feel and sense therefore seems foreign to me. And on being aware of the unreality of this division, the universe does not seem foreign any more.","Thus a Buddhist text says, \u201cIf the accumulation of false imaginations is cleared away, Enlightenment will appear. But the strange thing is that when people gain Enlightenment they realize that without false imaginations there could be no Enlightenment.","Indeed, the very reason why we do not have this assurance is that we want so much more than the minimum necessities.","[N]ature is ordered organically rather than politically, [i]t is a field of relationships rather than a collection of things.","We can hardly begin to consider this problem unless it is clear that the craving for security is itself a pain and a contradiction, and that the more we pursue it, the more painful it becomes.","[N]othing that is isolated can live, since the two most important characteristics of life are circulation and change.","Obviously, we try to know, name, and define fear in order to make it \\"objective,\\" that is, separate from \\"I.\\" But why are we trying to be separate from fear? Because we are afraid. In other words, fear is trying to separate itself from fear, as if one could fight fire with fire.","[N]ature is ordered organically rather than politically, [...] [i]t is a field of relationships rather than a collection of things.","The more we accustom ourselves to understanding the present in terms of memory, the unknown by the known, the living by the dead, the more desiccated and embalmed, the more joyless and frustrated life becomes.","Tod\u0117l neapleid\u017eia jausmas, kad mes gyvename ypatingo nesaugumo laikotarpiu.

Not only are there serious difficulties of communication between the intellectual and the general public, but the course of our thinking and of our very history has seriously undermined the common-sense assumptions which lie at the roots of our social conventions and institutions.","If, on the other hand, you are aware of fear, you realize that, because this feeling is now yourself, escape is impossible. You see that calling it \\"fear\\" tells you little or nothing about it, for the comparison and the naming is based, not on past experience, but on memory. You have then no choice but to be aware of it with your whole being as an entirely new experience. Indeed, every experience is in this sense new, and at every moment of our lives we are in the midst of the new and the unknown. At this point you receive the experience without resisting it or naming it, and the whole sense of conflict between \\"I\\" and the present reality vanishes.","Wars based on principle are far more destructive...the attacker will not destroy that which he is after.","man and his present experience are one, and that no separate \u201cI or mind can be found.\u201d","For our pleasures are not material pleasures but symbols of pleasure\u2014attractively packaged but inferior in content.","Jei esame \u012fsitikin\u0119, kad laim\u0117 priklauso nuo ka\u017eko, kas turi \u012fvykti ateityje, mes vaikom\u0117s \u017ealtvyksl\u0117s, kuri niekada nesileid\u017eia sugaunama.

When a bird flies, he flies on and on, and there is no end to the sky. From the most ancient times, there was never a fish who swam out of the water or a bird that flew out of the sky. Yet when the fish needs just a little water, he uses just a little, when he needs a lot, he uses lots. Thus the tips of their heads are always at the outer edge (of their space). Yet if there were a bird who first wanted to examine the extent of the sky, or a fish who first wanted to examine the extent of the water\u200a\u2014\u200aand then tried to fly or to swim, they will never find their own ways in the sky or the water.","one who thinks in Chinese has little difficulty in seeing that objects are also events, that our world is a collection of processes rather than entities.","Liberation is not the release of the soul from the body; it is recovery from the tactical split between the soul and the body which seems to be necessary for the social discipline of the young. It therefore sets reason and culture not against Eros but at the disposal of Eros, of the \u201cpolymorphous perverse body which always retains the potentiality of a fully erotic relationship with the world \u2014 not just through the genital system but through the whole sensory capacity.\u201d","All men suffer [...], but not all are unhappy, for unhappiness is a reaction to suffering, not suffering itself.","we carry thisx effort beyond a certain point, however, our manipulations interfere with the very course of nature, and this gets us into serious trouble indeed.","I may not, perhaps, be forgiven for introducing sober matters with a frivolous notion, but the problem of making sense out of the seeming chaos of experience reminds me of my childish desire to send someone a parcel of water in the mail. The recipient unties the string, releasing the deluge in his lap. But the game would never work, since it is irritatingly impossible to wrap and tie a pound of water in a paper package. There are kinds of paper which won\u2019t disintegrate when wet, but the trouble is to get the water itself into any manageable shape, and to tie the string without bursting the bundle.The more one studies attempted solutions to problems in politics and economics, in art, philosophy, and religion, the more one has the impression of extremely gifted people wearing out their ingenuity at the impossible and futile task of trying to get the water of life into neat and permanent packages.","When the critical intellect looks at anything carefully, it vanishes. [...] The reason is, of course, that \'\'things\'\' exist only relatively - for a point of view or for convenience of description. Thus when we inspect any unit more closely we find that its structure is more complex and more differentiated than we had supposed. Its variety comes to impress us more than its unity. This is why there is something of the spirit of debunking in all scholarship and scientific inquiry.","It is as if the eyes were trying to look at themselves directly, or as if one were trying to describe the color of a mirror in terms of colors reflected in the mirror. Just as sight is something more than all things seen, the foundation or \u201cground of our existence and our awareness cannot be understood in terms of things that are known. We are forced, therefore, to speak of it through myth - that is, through special metaphors, analogies, and images which say what it is like as distinct from what it is. At one extreme of its meaning, \u201cmyth\u201d is fable, falsehood, or superstition. But at another, \u201cmyth\u201d is a useful and fruitful image by which we make sense of life in somewhat the same way that we can explain electrical forces by comparing them with the behavior of water or air. Yet \u201cmyth,\u201d in this second sense, is not to be taken literally, just as electricity is not to be confused with air or water. Thus in using myth one must take care not to confuse image with fact, which would be like climbing up the signpost instead of following the road.\u201d","In other words, the \u201crigorously scientific method of predicting the future can be applied only in special cases\u2013where prompt action is not urgent, where the factors involved are largely mechanical, or in circumstances so restricted as to be trivial. By far the greater part of our important decisions depend upon \u201chunch\u201d\u2013in other words, upon the \u201cperipheral vision\u201d of the mind. Thus the reliability of our decisions rests ultimately upon our ability to \u201cfeel\u201d the situation, upon the degree to which this \u201cperipheral vision\u201d has been developed.\u201d","True, the seed does not intend to move itself with the wind, but neither did I intend to have arms and legs.","No valid plans for the future can be made by those who have no capacity for living fully now.","An organic natural order has its proper correspondence in a mode of consciousness which is a total feeling or experiencing. Where feeling is broken up into the feeler and the feeling, the knower and the known, what lies in between the two is not relationship but mere juxtaposition.","The \\"open\\" mind does this as most of us breathe: without being able to explain it at all. The principle of the thing is clearly something like judo, the gentle (ju) way (do) of mastering an opposing force by giving in to it.","And so, the secret in Taoism is to get out of one\u2019s own way, and to learn that this pushing ourselves, instead of making us more efficient, actually interferes with everything we set about to do.","When Lao-tzu said that mui, doing nothing, was the secret of harmony with the Tao, he really meant it. But what he meant by it must be distinguished very carefully from two other courses which sound quite different from one another, though they are really the same. The first course, I will call the way of deliberate imitation. This is to suppose that we actually know what the sane and natural way of living is, to embody it in laws and principles, techniques and ideals, and then try by a deliberate effort of imitation to follow them. This leads to all the contradictions with which we are so familiar, the contradiction of man bawling himself out\u2014as well as up\u2014for not doing what he tells himself to do. The second, and seemingly opposed course, I will call the way of deliberate relaxation, the way of \u201cto hell with it all. This is to try not to control oneself, to attempt to relax one\u2019s mind and let it think whatever it wants, to set out to accept one\u2019s self as it is without making any effort to change it. This leads to a vast, sloppy, disorganized mess, or to a kind of compulsive stillness, or sometimes to an equally compulsive psychological diarrhea. Both of these courses are far short of the real mui, of profound and radical nondoing. What brings them to the same thing is that, in their different ways, the two courses had a result in mind. They consisted equally in something done, or not done, to get to a goal. The goal in question was some sort of image, some mental picture, some vague feeling, of an ideal, of a state of accord with the Tao, of harmony with the Way of Nature.\u201d","To cut a long story short, thus far the contribution of logical philosophy to metaphysics has been entirely negative. The verdict seems to be that, under logical scrutiny, the entire body of metaphysical doctrine consists either of tautology or nonsense. But this amounts to a total \u201cdebunking of metaphysics only as it has been understood in the West\u2014as consisting of meaningful statements conveying information about \u201ctranscendental objects.\u201d Asian philosophy has never been of the serious opinion that metaphysical statements convey information of a positive character. Their function is not to denote \u201cReality\u201d as an object of knowledge, but to \u201ccure\u201d a psychological process by which man frustrates and tortures himself with all kinds of unreal problems. To the Asian mind, \u201cReality\u201d cannot be expressed; it can only be known intuitively by getting rid of unreality, of contradictory and absurd ways of thinking and feeling. The\u201d","Yet could anything be more obvious than that the past follows from the present like a comet\'s tail, and that if we are to be alive at all, here is the place to be?","For our radically misnamed \u201cmaterialistic civilization must above all cultivate the love of material, of earth, air, and water, of mountains and forests, of excellent food and imaginative housing and clothing, and of cherishing our artfully erotic contacts between human bodies. Certainly, all these so\u2013called \u201cthings\u201d are as impermanent as ripples in water, but what life, what love, what energy is there in a perfectly pure abstraction or a totally solid and eternally indestructible rock?\u201d","Knowledge is not an encounter between two separate things - a knowing subject and a known object. Knowledge, or better, knowing is a relationship in which knower and known are like the poles in a magnetic field. Human beings are aware of a world because, and only because, it is the sort of world that breeds knowing organisms. Humanity is not one thing and the world another; it has always been difficult for us to see that any organism is r so embedded in its environment that the evolution of so complex and intelligent a creature as man could never have come to pass without a reciprocal evolution of the environ\xadment. An intelligent man argues, without any resort to supernaturalism, an intelligent universe.","To define means to fix, and, when you get down to it, real life isn\'t fixed.","The common error of ordinary religious practice is to mistake the symbol for the reality, to look at the finger pointing the way and then to suck it for comfort rather than follow it. Religious ideas are like words\u2014 of little use, and often misleading, unless you know the concrete realities to which they refer. The word \u201cwater is a useful means of communication amongst those who know water. The same is true of the word and the idea called \u201cGod.\u201dI do not, at this point, wish to seem mysterious or to be making claims to \u201csecret knowledge.\u201d The reality which corresponds to \u201cGod\u201d and \u201ceternal life\u201d is honest, above-board, plain, and open for all to see. But the seeing requires a correction of mind, just as clear vision sometimes requires a correction of the eyes.The discovery of this reality is hindered rather than helped by belief, whether one believes in God or believes in atheism. We must here make a clear distinction between belief and faith, because, in general practice, belief has come to mean a state of mind which is almost the opposite of faith. Belief, as I use the word here, is the insistence that the truth is what one would \u201clief\u201d or wish it to be. The believer will open his mind to the truth on condition that it fits in with his preconceived ideas and wishes. Faith, on the other hand, is an unreserved opening of the mind to the truth, whatever it may turn out to be. Faith has no preconceptions; it is a plunge into the unknown. Belief clings, but faith lets go. In this sense of the word, faith is the essential virtue of science, and likewise of any religion that is not self-deception.Most of us believe in order to feel secure, in order to make our individual lives seem valuable and meaningful. Belief has thus become an attempt to hang on to life, to grasp and keep it for one\u2019s own. But you cannot understand life and its mysteries as long as you try to grasp it. Indeed, you cannot grasp it, just as you cannot walk off with a river in a bucket. If you try to capture running water in a bucket, it is clear that you do not understand it and that you will always be disappointed, for in the bucket the water does not run. To \u201chave\u201d running water you must let go of it and let it run. The same is true of life and of God.\u201d","One day I wiped out all the notions from my mind. I gave up all desire. I discarded all the words with which I thought and stayed in quietude. I felt a little queer\u2013as if I were being carried into something, or as if I were touching some power unknown to me\xa0\u2026\xa0and Ztt! I entered. I lost the boundary of my physical body. I had my skin, of course, but I felt I was standing in the center of the cosmos. I spoke, but my words had lost their meaning. I saw people coming towards me, but all were the same man. All were myself! I had never known this world. I had believed that I was created, but now I must change my opinion: I was never created; I was the cosmos; no individual Mr. Sasaki existed.","I am not looking at the world, not confronting it; I am knowing it by a continuous process of transforming it into myself, so that everything around me, the whole globe of space, no longer feels away from me but in the middle.","For there is a growing apprehension that existence is a rat-race in a trap: living organisms, including people, are merely tubes which put things in at one end and let them out at the other, which both keeps them doing it and in the long run wears them out. So to keep the farce going, the tubes find ways of making new tubes, which also put things in at one end and let them out at the other. At the input end they even develop ganglia of nerves called brains, with eyes and ears, so that they can more easily scrounge around for things to swallow.","How is it possible that a being with such sensitive jewels as the eyes, such enchanted musical instruments as the ears, and such a fabulous arabesque of nerves as the brain can experience itself as anything less than a god? And, when you consider that this incalculably subtle organism is inseparable from the still more marvelous patterns of its environment \u2014 from the minutest electrical designs to the whole company of the galaxies \u2014 how is it conceivable that this incarnation of all eternity can be bored with being?","This whole illusion has its history in ways of thinking\u2014in the images, models, myths, and language systems which we have used for thousands of years to make sense of the world. These have had an effect on our perceptions which seems to be strictly hypnotic. It is largely by talking that a hypnotist produces illusions and strange behavioral changes in his subjects\u2014talking coupled with relaxed fixation of the subject\u2019s conscious attention. The stage magician, too, performs most of his illusions by patter and misdirection of attention. Hypnotic illusions can be vividly sensuous and real to the subject, even after he has come out of the so-called \u201chypnotic trance. It is, then, as if the human race had hypnotized or talked itself into the hoax of egocentricity. There is no one to blame but ourselves.\u201d","[W] are belatedly realizing that the ill-treatment of the environment is damage to ourselves - for the simple reason that the subject and object cannot be separated, and that we and our surroundings are the process of a unified field[.]","God is the Self of the world, but you can\u2019t see God for the same reason that, without a mirror, you can\u2019t see your own eyes, and you certainly can\u2019t bite your own teeth or look inside your head. Your self is that cleverly hidden because it is God hiding.","To succeed is always to fail, in the sense that the more one succeeds at anything, the greater is the need to go on succeeding. To eat is to survive to be hungry.","The Tao that can be Tao-ed is not the Tao.","For there is a growing apprehension that existence is a rat-race in a trap: living organisms, including people, are merely tubes which put things in at one end and let them out at the other, which both keeps them doing it and in the long run wears them out.

At the input end they even develop ganglia of nerves called brains, with eyes and ears, so that they can more easily scrounge around for things to swallow. As and when they get enough to eat, they use up their surplus energy by wiggling in complicated patterns, making all sorts of noises by blowing air in and out of the input hole, and gathering together in groups to fight with other groups. In time, the tubes grow such an abundance of attached appliances that they are hardly recognizable as mere tubes, and they manage to do this in a staggering variety of forms.","For the feeling will not correspond to the theory until you have also discovered the unity of inner experience. Despite all theories, you will feel that you are isolated from life so long as you are divided within.","Thus the one absolutely essential requirement for the art of cooking is a love for its raw materials: the shape and feel of eggs, the sniff of flour, or mint, or garlic, the marvelous form and shimmer of a mackerel, the marbled red texture of a cut of beef, the pale green translucence of fresh lettuce, the concentric ellipses of a sliced onion, and the weight, warmth, and resilience of flour\u2013dusted dough under your fingers. The spiritual attitude of the cook will be all the more enriched if there is a familiarity with barns and vineyards, fishing wharves and dairies, orchards and kitchen gardens.","Wanting to get out of pain is the pain; it is not the \u201creaction of an \u201cI\u201d distinct from the pain. When you discover this, the desire to escape \u201cmerges\u201d into the pain itself and vanishes. Discounting aspirin for the moment, you cannot remove your head from a headache as you can remove your hand from a flame. \u201cYou\u201d equals \u201chead\u201d equals \u201cache.\u201d When you actually see that you are the pain, pain ceases to be a motive, for there is no one to be moved. It becomes, in the true sense, of no consequence. It hurts\u2014period.\u201d","And to say that this reality is natural is accurate enough if we mean spontaneous (tzu-jan) or natura naturans (\u201cnature naturing).\u201d","For man is always bound so long as he depends for his happiness on a partial experience; joy must always give way to sorrow, otherwise it can never be known as joy.","If everything, they said, was the creation and the operation of God, the statement had no more logic than \u201cEverything is up. But, as so often happens, when one tyrant is dethroned, a worse takes his place. The Crackpot Myth was retained without the Potter. The world was still understood as an artifact, but on the model of an automatic machine. The laws of nature were still there, but no lawmaker. According to the deists, the Lord had made this machine and set it going, but then went to sleep or off on a vacation.\u201d","The perfect Way [Tao] is without difficulty, Save that it avoids picking and choosing. Only when you stop liking and disliking Will all be clearly understood. A split hair\u2019s difference, And heaven and earth are set apart! If you want to get the plain truth, Be not concerned with right and wrong. The conflict between right and wrong Is the sickness of the mind.1 a","The full splendour of sexual experience does not reveal itself without a new mode of attention to the world in general.","In precisely the same way, the individual is separate from his universal environment only in name. When this is not recognized, you have been fooled by your name. Confusing names with nature, you come to believe that having a separate name makes you a separate being. This is\u2014rather literally\u2014to be spellbound.","(Perpetual leaves are, as we know, made of plastic, and there may come a time when surgeons will be able to replace all our organs with plastic substitutes, so that you will achieve immortality by becoming a plastic model of yourself.)","culture is an affront to the wisdom of nature and a ruinous exploitation of the human organism as a whole.","This is why modern civilization is in almost every respect a vicious circle. It is insatiably hungry because its way of life condemns it to perpetual frustration. [...] [T]he root of this frustration is that we live for the future, and the future is an abstraction, a rational inference from experience, which exists only for the brain. The \\"primary consciousness,\\" the basic mind which knows reality rather than ideas about it, does not know the future. It lives completely in the present, and perceives nothing more that what is at this moment. The ingenious brain, however, looks at that part of present experience called memory, and by studying it is able to make predictions. These predictions are, relatively, so accurate and reliable (e.g., \\"everyone will die\\") that the future assumes a high degree of reality - so high that the present loses its value.","Reality in itself is neither permanent nor impermanent; it cannot be categorized. But when one tries to hold on to it, change is everywhere apparent, since, like one\'s own shadow, the faster one pursues it, the faster it flees.","Read Theodore Schwenk\u2019s marvelous book Sensitive Chaos (London, Rudolph Steiner Press, 1965),","To begin with, this world has a different kind of time. It is the time of biological rhythm, notof the clock and all that goes with the clock. There is no hurry. Our sense of time isnotoriously subjective and thus dependent upon the quality of our attention, whether ofinterest or boredom, and upon the alignment of our behavior in terms of routines, goals, and deadlines. Here the present is self-sufficient, but it is not a static present. It is adancing present\xf3the unfolding of a pattern which has no specific destination in the futurebut is simply its own point. It leaves and arrives simultaneously, and the seed is as muchthe goal as the flower. There is therefore time to perceive every detail of the movementwith infinitely greater richness of articulation. Normally we do not so much look at things asoverlook them.","Listen, there\u2019s something I must tell. I\u2019ve never, never seen it so clearly. But it doesn\u2019t matter a bit if you don\u2019t understand, because each one of you is quite perfect as you are, even if you don\u2019t know it. Life is basically a gesture, but no one, no thing, is making it. There is no necessity for it to happen, and none for it to go on happening. For it isn\u2019t being driven by anything; it just happens freely of itself. It\u2019s a gesture of motion, of sound, of color, and just as no one is making it, it isn\u2019t happening to anyone. There is simply no problem of life; it is completely purposeless play \u2013 exuberance which is its own end. Basically there is the gesture. Time, space, and multiplicity are complications of it. There is no reason whatever to explain it, for explanations are just another form of complexity, a new manifestation of life on top of life, of gestures gesturing. Pain and suffering are simply extreme forms of play, and there isn\u2019t anything in the whole universe to be afraid of because it doesn\u2019t happen to anyone! There isn\u2019t any substantial ego at all. The ego is a kind of flip, a knowing of knowing, a fearing of fearing. It\u2019s a curlicue, an extra jazz to experience, a sort of double-take or reverberation, a dithering of consciousness which is the same as anxiety.","[W]hen I leave the Church and the city behind and go out under the sky, when I am with the birds, [...] with the clouds, [...] and with the oceans, [...] I cannot feel Christianity because I am in a world which grows from within. I am simply incapable of feeling its life as coming from above[.] More exactly, I cannot feel that its life comes from Another, from one who is qualitatively and spiritually external to all that lives and grows. On the contrary, I feel this whole world to be moved from the inside, and from an inside so deep that it is my inside as well, more truly I than my surface consciousness.","The intelligence being unconscious of positive and negative implies that the heart (hsin) is at ease.","To succeed is always to fail-in the sense that the more one succeeds in anything, the greater is the need to go on succeeding.

Its basic assumption is that God and nature are in competition and that man must choose between them. Its standpoint is radically dualistic[.]","My sense of kinship with this world is not only with its obviously sympathetic and and beautiful aspects, but also with the horrendous and strange. For I have found that the monstrous and inhuman aspects of fish and insects and reptiles are not so much in them as in me. They are external embodiments of my natural creeps and shudders at the thought of pain and death.","Suppressing the fear of death makes it all the stronger. The point is only to know, beyond any shadow of doubt, that \\"I\\" and all other \\"things\\" now present will vanish, until this knowledge compels you to release them - to know it now as surely as if you had just fallen off the rim of the Grand Canyon. Indeed you were kicked off the edge of a precipice when you were born, and it\'s no help to cling to the rocks falling with you. If you are afraid of death, be afraid. The point is to get with it, to let it take over - fear, ghosts, pains, transience, dissolution, and all.","[T]he problem for god was the same as the problem for the human ego. For even God\'s universe had spawned the Devil, who arises not so much from his own independent malice as from God\'s \'arrogance\' in assuming omnipotent kingship and identifying himself with unalloyed goodness. The Devil is god\'s unconsciously produced shadow. Naturally, God is not allowed to be responsible for the origin of evil, for the connection between the two lies in the unconscious. Man says, \'I didn\'t mean to hurt you, but my temper got the better of me, I shall try to control it in future.\' And God says, \'I didn\'t mean there to be any evil, but my angel Lucifer brought it up of his own free will.

These two questions are, however, much less important than why it happened, than the discovery of what it means. For","This, then, is the paradox that the greater our ethical idealism, the darker is the shadow that we cast, and that ethical monotheism became, in attitude if not in theory, the world\'s most startling dualism.","As soon as it becomes clear that \u201cI cannot possibly escape from the reality of the present, since \u201cI\u201d is nothing other than what I know now, this inner turmoil must stop. No possibility remains but to be aware of pain, fear, boredom, or grief in the same complete way that one is aware of pleasure. The human organism has the most wonderful powers of adaptation to both physical and psychological pain. But these can only come into full play when the pain is not being constantly restimulated by this inner effort to get away from it, to separate the \u201cI\u201d from the feeling.

So to keep the farce going, the tubes find ways of making new tubes, which also put things in at one end and let them out at the other.","There is only this now.

The difficulty is that it is so obvious andbasic that one can hardly find the words for it. The Germans call it aHintergedanke, an apprehension lying tacitly in the back of our mindswhich we cannot easily admit, even to ourselves. The sensation of \\"I\\" asa lonely and isolated center of being is so powerful andcommonsensical, and so fundamental to our modes of speech andthought, to our laws and social institutions, that we cannot experienceselfhood except as something superficial in the scheme of the universe.

And then, for each of us, it will end. It will all end. However long postponed, everything composed must decompose.","To begin with, this world has a different kind of time. It is the time of biological rhythm, notof the clock and all that goes with the clock. There is no hurry. Our sense of time isnotoriously subjective and thus dependent upon the quality of our attention, whether ofinterest or boredom, and upon the alignment of our behavior in terms of routines, goals, and deadlines. Here the present is self-sufficient, but it is not a static present. It is adancing present, the unfolding of a pattern which has no specific destination in the futurebut is simply its own point. It leaves and arrives simultaneously, and the seed is as muchthe goal as the flower. There is therefore time to perceive every detail of the movementwith infinitely greater richness of articulation. Normally we do not so much look at things asoverlook them.\u2015 Alan W Watts\u201d","Nature appears to be a hierarchy of many grades, corresponding to what the scientist calls \'\'levels of magnification.\\" Thus when we adjust our lenses to watch the individual cells of an organism we see only particular successes and failures, victories and defeats in what appears to be a ruthless \'\'dog-eat-dog\'\' battle. But when we change the level of magnification to observe the organism as a whole, we see that what was conflict at the lower level is harmony at the higher: that the health, the ongoing life of the organism is precisely the outcome of this microscopic turmoil.","Everyone knows that the Buddha nature is \u201cwithin oneself and is not to be sought outside, so that no student would be fooled by being told to seek it by going to India or by reading a certain sutra.\u201d","Thus in using myth one must take care not to confuse image with fact, which would be like climbing up the signpost instead of following the road","Earth is in heaven. It spins, falls, and floats in a spiral nebula. Earth is not opposed to heaven: it belongs in it as a member of the whole company of the stars.","The art forms of the Western world arise from spiritual and philosophical traditions in which spirit is divided from nature, and comes down from heaven to work upon it as an intelligent energy upon an inert and recalcitrant stuff. Thus Malraux speaks always of the artist \u201cconquering his medium as our explorers and scientists also speak of conquering mountains or conquering space. To Chinese and Japanese ears these are grotesque expressions. For when you climb it is the mountain as much as your own legs which lifts you upwards, and when you paint it is the brush, ink, and paper which determine the result as much as your own hand.\u201d","Consider the astonishing means now being made for snooping, the devices already used in offices, factories, stores, and on various lines of communication such as the mail and the telephone. Through the transistor and miniaturization techniques, these devices become ever more invisible and ever more sensitive to faint electrical impulses. The trend of all this is towards the end of individual privacy, to an extent where it may even be impossible to conceal one\u2019s thoughts. At the end of the line, no one is left with a mind of his own: there is just a vast and complex community-mind, endowed, perhaps, with such fantastic powers of control and prediction that it will already know its own future for years and years to come.","Now the expansion of consciousness is no other than extending our vision to comprehend many levels at once, and, above all, to grasp those higher levels in which the discords of the lower levels are resolved.","Unquestionably the sensitive human brain adds immeasurably to the richness of life. Yet for this we pay dearly, because the increase in over-all sensitivity makes us peculiarly vulnerable. One can be less vulnerable by becoming less sensitive\u2014more of a stone and less of a man\u2014and so less capable of enjoyment.","Le Zen sous-entend que l\'on suive e mouvement de la vie, sans valoir ni l\'arr\xeater ni interrompre son cours.

The frightened mind that runs away from everyday terrors meets the seeking mind that wants a better world.","If we are to have intense pleasures, we must also be liable to intense pains. The pleasure we love, and the pain we hate, but it seems impossible to have the former without the latter. Indeed, it looks as if the two must in some way alternate, for continuous pleasure is a stimulus that must either pall or be increased. And the increase will either harden the sense buds with its friction, or turn into pain. A consistent diet of rich food either destroys the appetite or makes one sick.","Essays in Zen Buddhism","To the degree, then, that life is found good, death must be proportionately evil.

Pure religions are as rare as pure cultures, and it is mentally crippling to suppose that there must be a number of fixed bodies of doctrine among which one must choose, where choice means accepting the system entirely or not at all. [...]. Those who rove freely through the various traditions, accepting what they can use and rejecting what they cannot, are condemned as undisciplined syncretists. But the use of one\'s reason is not a lack of discipline, not is there any important religion which is not itself a syncretism, a \\"growing up together\\" of ideas and practices of diverse origin.","[A]ny attempt to discover happiness is also an easy way to go crazy, and the world today is a crazy place just because people are trying to do it. We are a collection of people running wildly round in circles in frantic pursuit of our own selves, and the picture is not particularly edifying,[...] It is like trying to mend a hole in one part of a handkerchief by taking a patch from another. For the trouble is that all our schemes, systems, and devices are partial.","What does any group of people like to do when they don\u2019t have to do anything? As far as I can tell, people get together and do something rhythmic\u2014they dance, sing, and play games.","I obtained not the least thing from unexcelled, complete awakening, and for this very reason it is called \u201cunexcelled, complete awakening.","When I do philosophy\u2014like I\u2019m doing now\u2014I feel it is entertainment, but I hope it resembles listening to someone play beautiful music. I am not being serious, but I am being sincere. The difference between seriousness and sincerity is that seriousness is someone speaking in the context of the possibility of tragedy.","Work is something serious. It\u2019s what you do for a purpose, because you believe that you have to go on living. You have to work to survive, because you think you have to survive. But you don\u2019t have to. And this whole thing doesn\u2019t have to go on, which is why it does. I know that seems paradoxical, but think about it\u2014life is full of examples of this.

To give oneself utterly and slavishly to the world is to become a spiritual nonentity, a mechanism, a shell, a leaf blown by the winds of circumstance. But if the world is received and the self given at the same time, there prevails that union which brings about the Second Birth.\u201d","contrite, and in love with God.

On the bar itself were a few large crocks containing the basic and cheaper forms of the weed\u2014Panama Red, Acapulco Gold, Indian Ganja, and Domestic Green. But against the wall behind the bar stood a long cabinet furnished with hundreds of small drawers that a local guitar maker had decorated with intricate ivory inlays in the Italian style. Each drawer carried a label indicating the precise field and year of the product, so that one could purchase all the different varieties from Mexico, Lebanon, Morocco, Egypt, India, and Vietnam, as well as the carefully tended plants of devout cannabinologists here at home. Business was conducted with leisure and courtesy, and the salesmen offered small samples for testing at the bar, along with sensitive and expert discussion of their special effects. I might add that the stronger psychedelics, such as LSD, were coming to be used only rarely\u2014for psychotherapy, for retreats in religious institutions, and in our special hospitals for the dying.","Just as the bird leaves no trace, no record of its flight upon the void, so human desire can gain nothing out of life. But to realize this is at once to become the sage, since the greatest wisdom lies on the other side, immediately on the other side, of the greatest despair. It is, of course, something more than despair\u2014a joy, a sense of creative life and power, I might even say a security and certainty, beyond any imagining. But this is a way of feeling which the will and the imagination are as unable to bring about as to make one\u2019s bones grow or decrease the speed of the pulse. They must happen by themselves.","This is the\u2014always rare\u2014power of those who can both see the unknown and interpret it.

As an adult he plays, in self-defense, the role of the Philistine, to whom all intellectual and emotional culture is womanish and \u201csissy.\u201d Carried to its final extreme, the logical end of this type of reaction to life is suicide. The hard-bitten kind of person is always, as it were, a partial suicide; some of himself is already dead.\u201d","liberation is not revolution.

Its basis is the principle of Tao, which may be translated the Way of Nature. But in the Chinese language the word which we render as \u201cnature has a special meaning not found in its English equivalent. Translated literally, it means \u201cself-so.\u201d For to the Chinese, nature is what works and moves by itself without having to be shoved about, wound up, or controlled by conscious effort. Your heart beats \u201cself-so,\u201d and, if you would give it half a chance, your mind can function \u201cself-so\u201d\u2014though most of us are much too afraid of ourselves to try the experiment.\u201d","The sage no more seeks to obliterate the negative - darkness, death, etc. - than to get rid of autumn and winter from the cycle of the seasons.","To put it still more plainly: the desire for security and the feeling of insecurity are the same thing. To hold your breath is to lose your breath.We worry because we feel unsafe, and want to be safe. Yet it is perfectly useless to say that we should not want to be safe. Calling a desire bad names doesn\u2019t get rid of it. What we have to discover is that there is no safety, that seeking it is painful, and that when we imagine that we have found it, we don\u2019t like it. In other words, if we can really understand what we are looking for\u2014that safety is isolation, and what we do to ourselves when we look for it\u2014we shall see that we do not want it at all. No one has to tell you that you should not hold your breath for ten minutes. You know that you can\u2019t do it, and that the attempt is most uncomfortable.","Irrevocable commitment to any religion is not only intellectual suicide; it is positive unfaith because it closes the mind to any new vision of the world. Faith is, above all, open-ness\u2014an act of trust in the unknown. An","nirvana, must of necessity happen by itself. It not only cannot but must not be induced by trying and willing, since anything that one could will wouldn\u2019t be it.","the desire for security and the feeling of insecurity are the same thing. To hold your breath is to lose your breath.","Under these circumstances, the life that we live is a contradiction and a conflict. Because consciousness must involve both pleasure and pain, to strive for pleasure to the exclusion of pain is, in effect, to strive for the loss of consciousness. Because such a loss is in principle the same as death, this means that the more we struggle for life (as pleasure), the more we are actually killing what we love.","The unenlightened man keeps a tight hold on himself because he is afraid of losing himself; he can trust neither circumstances nor his own human nature; he is terrified of being genuine, of accepting himself as he is and tries to deceive himself into the belief that he is as he wishes to be. But these are the wishes, the desires that bind him, and it was such desires as these that the Buddha described as the cause of human misery.","Nor do I want to tell her just what I think of it in so many blunt words, because this would be uncharitable, and it might be knocking away a valuable stepping-stone to something better.","To abandon the idea of separation from and submission to God has always been feared as a threat to morals, but there is absolutely no evidence to show that monotheists have behaved more lovingly to one another than pantheists. If anything, the evidence goes the other way, for all peoples who have a cosmology that corresponds to a military chain of command are obnoxious fighters and imperialists. They are forever punishing and disciplining other people for their own good, and milking them to the limit at the same time.","When someone says, \u201cTime to stop now! he is in a panic because he has had nothing to eat yet, and wants more and more time to go on eating money, ever hopeful of satisfaction around the corner. We\u201d","[I]n trying to figure out the brain, the obstacle is that we have no finer instrument than the brain itself for the purpose. The greatest hindrance to objective knowledge is our own subjective presence.","For when we have Eros dominated by reason instead of Eros expressing itself with reason, we create a culture that is simply against life, in which the human organism has to submit more and more to the needs of mechanical organization, to postpone enjoyment in the name of an even more futile utility.","all belief is fervent hope, and thus a cover-up for doubt and uncertainty\u2014religions","The self pretends that things are getting serious, just like a great actor on the stage. Even though the audience knows that what they see on stage is only a play, the actor\u2019s skill takes them in\u2014they weep and laugh and sit on the edge of their seats with anticipation. They\u2019re utterly involved in what they really know is just a play. So that\u2019s what\u2019s going on here. Brahman is a tremendous actor with absolutely superb technique, so much so that Brahman takes itself in and feels that the play is real. We are all the Brahman acting out our own parts and playing the human game so beautifully that Brahman is enchanted, and this is what enchantment means\u2014under the influence of a chant, hypnotized, spellbound, fascinated. And that fascination is maya.","How can a republic be the best form of government if the universe, heaven and hell are all a monarchy?","Protogenesis The Seven SecretSayings of God Before athe beginning when God created the heaven and the earth, and the earth was without form, and void: and darkness was upon the face of the deep, God said bI AM THAT. And it is so. Also, being in eternity which is neither linear nor sequential, where all is nowever, God said, YOU MUST DRAW THE LINE SOMEWHERE. And it was drawn. But it was no dreary straight line or flat wall, for God then said, HAVE A BALL. And there was a ball, in the image whereof all stars and planets came to be formed. Thereupon God said, THERE ARE TWO SIDES TO EVERYTHING. And there are: the inside and the outside, the dense and the spacious, the right and the wrong, the left and the taken, for, as it is written, cOne shall be taken, and the other left. And God said, IT MUST BE IN TIME. And thereafter it was, is, and will be, for as it is written again, dAs it was in the beginning is now, and ever shall be, through all ages of ages. Amen. And forthwith God said, SPACE IT OUT. Whereupon it came to pass that, beside this and that and now and then, there is also here and there. And God beheld ehow firm a foundation this was and said unto himself, GET LOST. And there you are.","Finally, there are two specific objections to use of psychedelic drugs. First, use of thesedrugs may be dangerous. However, every worth-while exploration is dangerous--climbingmountains, testing aircraft, rocketing into outer space, skin diving, or collecting botanicalspecimens in jungles. But if you value knowledge and the actual delight of exploration morethan mere duration of uneventful life, you are willing to take the risks. It is not really healthyfor monks to practice fasting, and it was hardly hygienic for Jesus to get himself crucified,but these are risks taken in the course of spiritual adventures.","[F]or several thousand years we have been obsessed with a false humility\u2014on the one hand, putting ourselves down as mere creatures\\" who came into this world by the whim of God or the fluke of blind forces, and on the other, conceiving ourselves as separate personal egos fighting to control the physical world. We have lacked the real humility of recognizing that we are members of the biosphere, the \\"harmony of contained conflicts\\" in which we cannot exist at all without the cooperation of plants, insects, fish, cattle, and bacteria. In the same measure, we have lacked the proper self-respect of recognizing that I, the individual organism, am a structure of such fabulous ingenuity that it calls the whole universe into being. In the act of putting everything at a distance so as to describe and control it, we have orphaned ourselves both from the surrounding world and from our own bodies\u2014leaving \\"I\\" as a discontented and alienated spook, anxious, guilty, unrelated, and alone.","To keep up this \u201cstandard most of us are willing to put up with lives that consist largely in doing jobs that are a bore, earning the means to seek relief from the tedium by intervals of hectic and expensive pleasure. These intervals are supposed to be the real living, the real purpose served by the necessary evil of work. Or we imagine that the justification of such work is the rearing of a family to go on doing the same kind of thing, in order to rear another family\xa0\u2026\xa0and so ad infinitum.\u201d","For the coherent continuity of any one individual is much like a whirlpool in a river; it is \u201cthere day after day, although the water itself never stays put. You could even say that there is no such thing as a whirlpool, but that the river is whirlpooling in the same way that the universe eyes and the plant flowers.\u201d","But the idea of a purposeless world is horrifying because it is incomplete. Purpose is a pre-eminently human attribute. To say that the world has no purpose is to say that it is not human[.] For what is not human appears to be inhuman only when man sets himself over against nature, for then the inhumanity of nature seems to deny man, and its purposelessness to deny his purposes. But to say that nature is not human and has no purpose is not to say what it has instead. The human body as a whole is not a hand, but it does not for this reason deny the hand.","Those who search for happiness do not find it because they do not understand that the object of the search is the seeker.","[F]ast intercommunication between points is making all points the same point.","When cultural disciplines are in the service of Eros, ethics are transformed from the rules of repression into the technique of expression, and morality becomes the aesthetics of behavior.","However, when we do not grasp, we have the attitude of faith. If you let go of all the idols you will of course discover that what this unknown is, which is the foundation of the universe, is precisely you.","Eyes and light arise mutually in the same way as yin and yang. The universe is not, therefore, composed of independent things, that is: as human thought ordinarily fragments it: but the universe disposes itself as things. It is one body, one field, whose parts give rise to each other as inseparably as fronts and backs, but in an endlessly complex and interconnected maze.","This kind of living in the fantasy of expectation rather than the reality of the present is the special trouble of those business men who live entirely to make money. So many people of wealth understand much more about making and saving money than about using and enjoying it. They fail to live because they are always preparing to live. Instead of earning a living they are mostly earning an earning, and thus when the time comes to relax they are unable to do so.","To look at life without words is not to lose the ability to form words\u2014to think, remember, and plan. To be silent is not to lose your tongue. On the contrary, it is only through silence that one can discover something new to talk about. One who talked incessantly, without stopping to look and listen, would repeat himself ad nauseam. It is the same with thinking, which is really silent talking. It is not, by itself, open to the discovery of anything new, for its only novelties are simply rearrangements of old words and ideas.","Under any civilized conditions it is, of course, impossible for anyone to act without laying plans, or to refuse absolutely to participate in an economy of waste and violence, [...]. It is, however, possible to see that this competitive \\"rat race\\" need not be taken seriously, or rather, that if we are to persist in it at all it must not be taken seriously unless \\"nervous breakdowns are to become as common as colds","We see God every time we open our eyes; we inhale Him at every breath; we use His strength in every movement of our finger; we think Him in every thought, although we may not think of Him, and we taste Him in every bite of food.","Life [...] is not a problem, so why are you asking for a solution?","It is obviously the purest anthropomorphism to assume that the absence of a human quality in bird, cloud, or star is the presence of a total blank, or to assume that what is not conscious is merely unconscious. Nature is not necessarily arranged in accordance with the system of mutually exclusive alternatives which characterize our language and logic.","No one wants to be loved out of a sense of duty.","[S]een as a whole the universe is a harmony or symbiosis of patterns which cannot exist without each other.","This, then, is the human problem: there is a price to be paid for every increase in consciousness. We cannot be more sensitive to pleasure without being more sensitive to pain.","The timid mind shuts this window with a bang, and is silent and thoughtless about what it does not know in order to chatter the more about what it thinks it knows. It fills up the uncharted spaces with mere repetition of what has already been explored. But the open mind knows that the most minutely explored territories have not really been known at all, but only marked and measured a thousand times over. And the fascinating mystery of what it is that we mark and measure must in the end \u201ctease us out of thought until the mind forgets to circle and to pursue its own processes, and becomes aware that to be at this moment is pure miracle. In\u201d","This is a way of saying that our deepest spiritual, religious, and psychological problems are extremely simple. Just go out and look at the sky. Get to know where you are. Heaven is there for all to see.","The sense of the vast gulf between the ego and the world disappears and one\'s subjective inner life seems no longer to be separate from everything else, from one\'s total experience of the stream of nature.","For while scientist and logician dissect and analyze, the mystic looks for meaning in the whole.","Everything is the Tao\' - an integrated, harmonious, and universal process from which it is absolutely impossible to deviate. This sensation is marvelous, to put it mildly, though there is no logical reason why it should be so, unless it is just through release from the chronic feeling of having to \'face\' reality. For here one does not face life anymore; one simply is it.","this is the last word of Western and Eastern wisdom alike. The Hindu Upanishads say: He who thinks that God is not comprehended, by him God is comprehended; but he who thinks that God is comprehended knows him not. God is unknown to those who know him, and is known to those who do not know him at all. Goethe says it in words which, to the modern mind, may be plainer: The highest to which man can attain is wonder; and if the prime phenomenon makes him wonder, let him be content; nothing higher can it give him, and nothing further should he seek for behind it; here is the limit.","A monk asked Ts\u2019ui-wei, \u201cFor what reason did the First Patriarch come from the West? Ts\u2019ui-wei answered, \u201cPass me that chin-rest.\u201d As soon as the monk passed it, Ts\u2019ui-wei hit him with it.20\u201d","Whenever a tradition becomes venerable with the passage of time, the ancient masters and sages are elevated to pedestals of sanctity and wisdom which lift them far above the human level. The way of liberation becomes confused with a popular cult; the ancient teachers become gods and supermen, and thus the ideal of liberation or Buddha-hood becomes ever more remote. No one believes that it can be reached except by the most gifted and heroic prodigies. Consequently the medicine of the discipline becomes a diet, the cure an addiction, and the raft a houseboat. In this manner, a way of liberation turns into just another social institution and dies of respectability.","Our progress has been almost exclusively technological, which means that we are able to manipulate the physical world ever more sensationally, to increase the speed, the span, and the powers of material existence without any clear idea of what to do with the time gained and the powers acquired.","In other words, the \u201crigorously scientific method of predicting the future can be applied only in special cases-where prompt action is not urgent, where the factors involved are largely mechanical, or in circumstances so restricted as to be trivial.

He works for success, fame, a happy marriage, fun, to help other people, or to be a \u201creal person. But these are not real wants because they are not actual things. They are the by-products, the flavors and atmospheres of real things\u2014shadows which have no existence apart from some substance.

Also, alas, one might ask what kind of individual would want to spend millions of dollars to become president of the United States, never away from the telephone, guarded around the clock by agents of the Secret Service, reading tomes of amazingly uninteresting documents, and being accompanied day and night by a warrant officer carrying a black bag containing the mechanisms to set off the atomic bomb? We believe that all such occupations, dreary or dangerous as they may be, are exercises of high responsibility and even of glory, despite the maxim that \u201cthe paths of glory lead but to the grave.

It is as necessary to have air, water, plants, insects, birds, fish, and mammals as it is to have brains, hearts, lungs, and stomachs.

If then, we can no more live without the things outside than without those inside, the plain inference is that the words \u201cI and \u201cmyself \u201d must include both sides.

There are so many great people, great in knowledge or great in what is called holiness with whom the ordinary individual feels rather embarrassed. He feels inclined to sit on the edge of his chair and to feel immediately judged by this person\u2019s wisdom or sanctity. Jung managed to have wisdom and I think also sanctity in such a way that when other people came into its presence they didn\u2019t feel judged, they felt enhanced, encouraged and invited to share in a common life. And there was a sort of twinkle in Jung\u2019s eye that gave me the impression that he knew himself to be just as much a villain as everybody else. There\u2019s a nice German word - \u2018hintergedanke\u2019, which means a thought in the very far far back of your mind. Jung had a hintergedanke in the back of his mind which showed, it showed in the twinkle in his eyes, it showed that he knew and recognized what i have sometimes called \u2018the element of irreducible rascality\u2019 in himself.","Nevertheless, it strikes me more and more that America\u2019s reputation for materialism is unfounded\u2014that is, if a materialist is a person who thoroughly enjoys the physical world and loves material things. In this sense, we are superb materialists when it comes to the construction of jet aircraft, but when we decorate the inside of these magnificent monsters for the comfort of passengers it is nothing but frippery. High-heeled, narrow-hipped, doll-type girls serving imitation, warmed-over meals. For our pleasures are not material pleasures but symbols of pleasure\u2014attractively packaged but inferior in content. The explanation is simple: most of our products are being made by people who do not enjoy making them, whether as owners or workers. Their aim in the enterprise is not the product but money, and therefore every trick is used to cut the cost of production and hoodwink the buyer, by coloring and packaging chicanery, into the belief that the product is well and truly made. The only exceptions are those products which simply must be excellent for reasons of safety or high cost of purchase\u2014aircraft, computers, space-rockets, scientific instruments, and so forth. But the whole scheme is a vicious circle, for when you have made the money what will you buy with it? Other pretentious fakes made by other money-mad manufacturers. The","When you realize that you live in, that indeed you are this moment now, and no other, that apart from this there is no past and no future, you must relax and taste to the full, whether it be pleasure or pain. At once it becomes obvious why this universe exists, why conscious beings have been produced, why sensitive organs, why space, time, and change. The whole problem of justifying nature, of trying to make life mean something in terms of its future, disappears utterly. Obviously, it all exists for this moment. It is a dance, and when you are dancing you are not intent on getting somewhere. You go round and round, but not under the illusion that you are pursuing something, or fleeing from the jaws of hell.","Life exists only at this very moment, and in this moment it is infinite and eternal. For the present moment is infinitely small; before we can measure it, it has gone, and yet it persists forever. This movement and change has been called Tao by the Chinese. . . . A sage has said that if we try to accord with it, we shall get away from it. But he was not altogether right.

The first is a marvelous wiggly affair, blue, green, brown, yellow, and occasionally white.

Which of the two more closely resembles Earth as seen from outer space?","There may be wrong actions in the sense of actions contrary to the rules of human communication. But the way you feel towards other people: loving, hating, et cetera, et cetera; there aren\u2019t any wrong feelings.And so, to try and force one\u2019s feelings to be other than what they are is absurd. And furthermore: dishonest.But you see: the idea that there are no wrong feelings is an immensely threatening one to people who are afraid to feel.This is one of the peculiar problems of our culture: we are terrified of our feelings. We think that if we give them any scope and if we don\u2019t immediately beat them down, they will lead us down into all kinds of chaotic and destructive actions.But if, for a change, we would allow our feelings and look upon their comings and goings as something as beautiful and necessary as changes in the weather, the going of night and day and the four seasons, we would be at peace with ourselves.","We must go to the roots of a problem and not invest too much energy fiddling with the symptoms. We shall never get whites and blacks, or Orientals and Occidentals, to unite by trying to tie the different branches of the human tree together with string.

Yoga means \'union,\' that is, the realization of on man\'s inner identity with Brahman or Tao, and strictly speaking this is not an end to which there are methods or means since it cannot be made an object of desire. The attempt to achieve it invariably thrusts it away.","For to define is to isolate, to separate some complex of forms from the stream of life and say, \u201cThis is I. When man can name and define himself, he feels that he has an identity. Thus he begins to feel, like the word, separate and static, as over against the real, fluid world of nature.\u201d","The \u201cnatural man lives for one motive: to protect his body from pain and to associate it with pleasure. Because he can only feel with his own body, he has little interest in the feelings of other bodies. Therefore he will only take interest in other bodies under the stimulus of rewards and punishments, that is, by an exploitation of his self-interest in the interest of the community.\u201d","The startling truth is that our best efforts for civil rights, international peace, population control, conservation of natural resources, and assistance to the starving of the earth\u2014urgent as they are\u2014will destroy rather than help if made in the present spirit. For, as things stand, we have nothing to give. If our own riches and our own way of life are not enjoyed here, they will not be enjoyed anywhere else.","[P]erhaps the reason for this love of nonhuman nature is that communion with it restores us to a level of our own human nature at which we are still sane, free from humbug, and untouched by anxieties about the meaning and purpose of our lives. For what we call \'nature\' is free from a certain kind of scheming and self-importance. The birds and beasts indeed pursue their business of eating and breeding with the utmost devotion. But they do not justify it; they do not pretend that it serves higher ends, or that it makes a significant contribution to the progress of the world.","God is the Self of the world, but you can\'t see God for the same reason that, without a mirror, you can\'t see your own eyes, and you certainly can\'t bite your own teeth or look inside your head. Your self is that cleverly hidden because it is God hiding.","I am sure, however, that the body dies because it wants to. It finds it beyond its power to resist the disease or to mend the injury, and so, tired out with the struggle, turns to death.","We are really stuck with ourselves, and our attempts to reject or to accept are equally fruitless, for they fail to reach that inaccessible center of our selfhood which is trying to do the accepting or the rejecting.","We suffer from a hallucination, from a false and distorted sensation of our own existence as living organisms. Most of us have the sensation that \\"I myself\\" is a separate center of feeling and action, living inside and bounded by the physical body\u2014a center which \\"confronts\\" an \\"external\\" world of people and things, making contact through the senses with a universe both alien and strange. Everyday figures of speech reflect this illusion. \\"I came into this world.\\" \\"You must face reality.\\" \\"The conquest of nature.\\" This feeling of being lonely and very temporary visitors in the universe is in flat contradiction to everything known about man (and all other living organisms) in the sciences.","For every sentient being is God\u2014omnipotent, omniscient, infinite, and eternal\u2014pretending with the utmost sincerity and determination to be otherwise, to be a mere creature subject to failure, pain, death, temptation, hellfire, and ultimate tragedy.","As an apple tree apples the solar system in which we live peoples and therefore we are an expression of its energy and of its nature","The sins after the Devil\u2019s heart are the intricacies of spiritual pride, the mazes of self-deception, and the subtle mockeries of hypocrisy where mask hides behind mask behind mask and reality is lost altogether.","While living, be a dead man, thoroughly dead; Then, whatever you do, just as you will, will be right.","There is, then, an analogy\u2013and perhaps more than mere analogy\u2013between central vision and conscious, one-at-a-time thinking, and between peripheral vision and the rather mysterious process which enables us to regulate the incredible complexity of our bodies without thinking at all. It should be noted, further, that we call our bodies complex as a result of trying to understand them in terms of linear thought, of words and concepts. But the complexity is not so much in our bodies as in the task of trying to understand them by this means of thinking.","But this particular kind of tension against the stream is habitual, and the frustration which it engenders is chronic. If I believe that I would like to break the habit, that very wish is another form of the same tension, and this in turn is a form of the basic un-get-at-ability of It. We are all lunatics trying to stick pins into their own points, and it is thus that our frantic efforts to set the world to rights and to extend our control over all happenings, inner and outer, are themselves the cause of most of our troubles. All force is tension against the stream.","for when there are no names the world is no longer \u201cclassified in limits and bounds.","People try to accept themselves in order to be different, and try to surrender themselves in order to have more self-respect in their own eyes\u2014or","You do not need to control the rain if you can control your mind.

Men and birds against fish, fish against fish. The tortuous process of life continuing by the painful transformation of one form or body into another. To creatures who do not anticipate and reflect imaginatively on this holocaust of eating and being eaten, this is perhaps not so terrible. But poor man! Skillful beyond all other animals, by being able to think in time, and abstractly knowing the future, he dies before he is dead. He shrinks from the shark\u2019s teeth before they bite him, and he dreads the alien germ long, long before its banquet begins.

Indeed, it seems extremely odd.It is a special kind of enlightenment to have this feeling that the usual, the way things normally are, is odd - uncanny and highly improbable. G. K. Chesterton once said that it is one thing to be amazed at a gorgon or a griffin, creatures which do not exist; but it is quite another and much higher thing to be amazed at a rhinoceros or a giraffe, creatures which do exist and look as if they don\u2019t. This feeling of universal oddity includes a basic and intense wondering about the sense of things. Why, of all possible worlds, this colossal and apparently unnecessary multitude of galaxies in a mysteriously curved space-time continuum, these myriads of differing [...] species playing frantic games of one-upmanship, these numberless ways of \u201cdoing it from the elegant architecture of the snow crystal or the diatom to the startling magnificence of the lyrebird or the peacock?\u201d","Thus contemplation or meditation which seeks a result is neither contemplation nor meditation, for the simple reason that contemplation (kuan) is consciousness without seeking. Naturally, such consciousness is concentrated, but it is not \'practising concentration;\' it is concentrated in whatever happens to be its \'eternal now.","Man is a thinking reed but his great works are done when he is not calculating and thinking. \u2018Childlikeness\u2019 has to be restored with long years of training in the art of selfforgetfulness. When this is attained, man thinks yet he does not think. He thinks like showers coming down from the sky; he thinks like the waves rolling on the ocean; he thinks like the stars illuminating the nightly heavens; he thinks like the green foliage shooting forth in the relaxing spring breeze. Indeed, he is the showers, the ocean, the stars, the foliage.","Civilization, comprising all the achievements of art and science, technology and industry, is the result of man\u2019s invention and manipulation of symbols\u2014of words, letters, numbers, formulas and concepts, and of such social institutions as universally accepted clocks and rulers, scales and timetables, schedules and laws. By these means, we measure, predict, and control the behavior of the human and natural worlds\u2014and with such startling apparent success that the trick goes to our heads. All too easily, we confuse the world as we symbolize it with the world as it is.","But the Oriental musician has a rough notation which he uses only as a reminder of a melody. He learns music, not by reading notes, but by listening to the performance of a teacher, getting the \u201cfeel of it, and copying him, and this enables him to acquire rhythmic and tonal sophistications matched only by those Western jazz artists who use the same approach.\u201d","But it is just this reality of the present, this moving, vital now which eludes all the definitions and descriptions. Here is the mysterious real world which words and ideas can never pin down. Living always for the future, we are out of touch with this source and center of life, and as a result all the magic of naming and thinking has come to something of a temporary breakdown.","A Chinese philosophical work called The Secret of the Golden Flower says that \u201cwhen purpose has been used to achieve purposelessness, the thing has been grasped. For a society surviving to no purpose is one that makes no provision for purposeless behavior\u2014that is, for actions not directly aimed at survival, which fulfill themselves in being done in the present and do not necessarily imply some future reward.\u201d","Conscious attention is not really the effective controlling force in your life, it\u2019s merely the lookout. It\'s merely an information source which warns the organism as a whole of unusual features of the environment.

There is nothing complex about walking, breathing, and circulating one\'s blood. Living organisms have developed these functions without without thinking about them at all. The circulation of the blood becomes complex only when stated in physiological terms, that is, when understood by means of a conceptual model constructed of the kind of simple units which conscious attention requires.","[P]eace can be made only by those who are peaceful, and love can be shown only by those who love.No work of love will flourish out of guilt, fear, or hollowness of heart, just as no valid plans for the future can be made by those who have no capacity for living now.","The natural world seems a marvel of complexity, requiring a vastly intricate intelligence to create and govern it, just because we have represented it to ourselves in the clumsy \'notation\' of thought. [...] Understanding nature by means of thought is like trying to make out the contours of an enormous cave with the aid of a small flashlight casting a bright but very thin beam. The path of the light and the series of \'spots\' over which it has passed must be retained in memory, and from this record the general appearance of the cave must laboriously be reconstructed.","concerns itself with the linguistic, ethical, legal, and ritual conventions which provide the society with its system of communication. Confucianism, in other words, preoccupies itself with conventional knowledge, and under its auspices children are brought up so that their originally wayward and whimsical natures are made to fit the Procrustean bed of the social order. The individual defines himself and his place in society in terms of the Confucian formulae.","Thus if man is to realize again his fundamental unity and harmony with life he must proceed by the roundabout way of trying to get that which he already has until he convinces himself of his own folly. For it is only by trying to accept life as a whole that we can make ourselves aware that there was never any real need to try, and that spirituality is in fact a matter of \u201cbecoming what we are.","our age is one of frustration, anxiety, agitation, and addiction to \u201cdope. Somehow we must grab what we can while we can, and drown out the realization that the whole thing is futile and meaningless.

It is said that humanity has evolved one-sidedly, growing in technical power without any comparable growth in moral integrity, or, as some would prefer to say, without comparable progress in education and rational thinking. Yet the problem is more basic. The root of the matter is the way in which we feel and conceive ourselves as human beings, our sensation of being alive, of individual existence and identity. We suffer from a hallucination, from a false and distorted sensation of our own existence as living organisms. Most of us have the sensation that \u201cI myself is a separate center of feeling and action, living inside and bounded by the physical body\u2014 a center which \u201cconfronts\u201d an \u201cexternal\u201d world of people and things, making contact through the senses with a universe both alien and strange.

There is nothing unique, or \u201cdifferent,\u201d or interesting about it. On the contrary, the more human beings pursue it, the more uniform, uninteresting, and impersonal they become. The faster things move in circles, the sooner they become indistinguishable blurs. It is obvious that the only interesting people are interested people, and to be completely interested is to have forgotten about \u201cI.\u201d","[I]t is rather the past and the future which are the fleeting illusions, and the present which is eternally real. We discover that the linear succession of time is a convention of our single-track verbal thinking, of a consciousness which interprets the world by grasping little pieces of it, calling them things and events. But every such grasp of the mind excludes the rest of the world, so that this type of consciousness can get an approximate vision of the whole only through a series of grasps, one after the other.","[T]he full and real self is not the willing and deliberating function but the spontaneous.","Seeking for \u201cGod in this way is no more than asking for the stamp of absolute authority and certainty on what you believe in any case, for a guarantee that the unknown and the future will be a continuation of what\u201d","What you are basically, deep, deep down, far, far inn, is simply the fabric and structure of existence itself","May not this, then, be why the figure of the Evil One is simultaneously horrendous and alluring: he represents the extreme of \'\'self-othering,\\" where, on the human level, man is most ashamed of his own organism, and, on the mythological level, Brahma has lost himself most completely in the maya of separateness.","The more inward and central the form of activity, the less it partakes of the mask of the ego. To unveil the flow of thought can therefore be an even greater sexual intimacy than physical nakedness.","The sensation of \u201cI as a lonely and isolated center of being is so powerful and commonsensical, and so fundamental to our modes of speech and thought, to our laws and social institutions, that we cannot experience selfhood except as something superficial in the scheme of the universe.

[...] On being told that this is wrong, the mind will even make efforts not to make efforts.This can come to an end only when it is clearly seen that all these efforts are as futile as trying to leap into the air and fly, as struggling to sleep, or as forcing an erection of the sexual member. Everyone is familiar with the contradiction of trying to recollect a forgotten name, and though it happens again and again, we never seem to trust the memory to supply the information spontaneously. Yet this is one of the most common forms of what is known in Zen Buddhism as satori - the effortless, spontaneous and sudden dawning of a realization.","living organisms, including people, are merely tubes which put things in at one end and let them out at the other, which both keeps them doing it and in the long run wears them out. So to keep the farce going, the tubes find ways of making new tubes, which also put things in at one end and let them out at the other.","The self-conscious brain, like the self-conscious heart, is a disorder, and manifests itself in the acute feeling of separation between \u201cI and my experience. The brain can only assume its proper behavior when consciousness is doing what it is designed for: not writhing and whirling to get out of present experience, but being effortlessly aware of it.\u201d","if ultimate Reality is not a machine the only other thing it can be is a living Being.","For there is no joy in continuity, in the perpetual.

For example, it used to be thought that childbirth should be painful, as a punishment for Original Sin or for having had so much fun conceiving the baby. For God had said to Eve and all her daughters, \u201cIn sorrow thou shalt bring forth children. Thus when everyone believed that in having a baby it was a woman\u2019s duty to suffer, women did their duty, and many still do.

Consciousness is ever upon the alert for new conditions in the environment so as to keep the rest of the organism I informed about adaptations that must be made, and this style of attention comes to eclipse the more open and total style of sensitivity that we have in the beginning.","In other words, you have been hypnotized or conditioned by an educational processing-system arranged in grades or steps, supposedly leading to some ultimate Success. First nursery school or kindergarten, then the grades or forms of elementary school, preparing you for the great moment of secondary school! But then more steps, up and up to the coveted goal of the university. Here, if you are clever, you can stay on indefinitely by getting into graduate school and becoming a permanent student. Otherwise, you are headed step by step for the great Outside World of family-raising, business, and profession. Yet graduation day is a very temporary fulfillment, for with your first sales-promotion meeting you are back in the same old system, being urged to make that quota (and if you do, they\u2019ll give you a higher quota) and so progress up the ladder to sales manager, vice-president, and, at last, president of your own show (about forty to forty-five years old). In the meantime, the insurance and investment people have been interesting you in plans for Retirement\u2014that really ultimate goal of being able to sit back and enjoy the fruits of all your labors. But when that day comes, your anxieties and exertions will have left you with a weak heart, false teeth, prostate trouble, sexual impotence, fuzzy eyesight, and a vile digestion.","The perfect man employs his mind as a mirror; it grasps nothing; it refuses nothing; it receives, but does not keep.","We do not really want continuity, but rather a present experience of total happiness.","The meaning of being alive is just being alive","The difference between \u201cI and \u201cme\u201d is largely an illusion of memory. In truth, \u201cI\u201d is of the same nature as \u201cme.\u201d It is part of our whole being, just as the head is part of the body. But if this is not realized, \u201cI\u201d and \u201cme,\u201d the head and the body, will feel at odds with each other. \u201cI,\u201d not understanding that it too is part of the stream of change, will try to make sense of the world and experience by attempting to fix it.\u201d","To put it in another way, at each moment we are what we experience, and there is no real possibility of being other than what we are. Wisdom therefore consists in accepting what we are, rather than in struggling fruitlessly to be something else, as if it were possible to run away from one\u2019s own feet.","Life is not a matter of life or death; it is a matter of life and death, and ultimately there is nothing to be dreaded. There is nothing outside the universe, against which it can crash.","Human beings appear to be happy just so long as they have a future to which they can look forward\u2014whether it be a \u201cgood time tomorrow or an everlasting life beyond the grave. For various reasons, more and more people find it hard to believe in the latter. On the other hand, the former has the disadvantage that when this \u201cgood time\u201d arrives, it is difficult to enjoy it to the full without some promise of more to come. If happiness always depends on something expected in the future, we are chasing a will-o\u2019-the-wisp that ever eludes our grasp, until the future, and ourselves, vanish into the abyss of death.\u201d","And the sage does not see himself as a little thing thrown into a vast and alien space: for him, the thing-space is a unity as inseparable as life-death, up-down, back-front, or inside-outside.","No venimos a este mundo, surgimos de \xe9l","The rules of communication are not necessarily the rules of the universe, and man is not the role or identity which society thrusts upon him. For when a man no longer confuses himself with the definition of himself that others have given him, he is at once universal and unique. He is universal by virtue of the inseparability of his organism from the cosmos. He is unique in that he is just this organism and not any stereotype of role, class, or identity assumed for the convenience of social communication.","us. The good of contemplation is contemplation\u2014not some result that it may bring.","Those who know do not speak; Those who speak do not know. (56)","[S]ocial institutions are simply rules of communication which have no more universal validity than, say, the rules of a particular grammar.","[O]pposites, such as light and darkness, sound and silence, solid and space, on and off, inside and outside, appearing and disappearing, cause and effect, are poles or aspects of the same thing. But we have no word for that thing, save such vague concepts as Existence, Being, God, or the Ultimate Ground of Being.","But the mind-body is a system which conserves and accumulates energy. While doing this it is properly lazy. When the energy is store, it is just as happy to move, and yet to move skillfully -- along the line of least resistance. Thus it is not only necessity, but also laziness, which is the mother of invention.","[L]iberation does not involve the loss or destruction of such conventional concepts as the ego; it means seeing through them - in the same way that we can use the idea of the equator without confusing it with a physical mark upon the surface of the earth. Instead of falling below the ego, liberation surpasses it.","[A]wareness of time ceases to be an asset when concern for the future makes it almost impossible to live in the present[.]","The pain is inescapable, and resistance as a defense only makes it worse; the whole system is jarred by the shock. Seeing the impossibility of this course, it must act according to its nature -- remain stable and absorb.","The trend of all this is towards the end of individual privacy, to an extent where it may even be impossible to conceal one\u2019s thoughts. At the end of the line, no one is left with a mind of his own: there is just a vast and complex community-mind, endowed, perhaps, with such fantastic powers of control and prediction that it will already know its own future for years and years to come.","When you get the message, it\'s time to hang up the phone.","exemplified in such tales as The Wind in the Willows, Winnie the Pooh, and innumerable folk tales from all cultures. Anthropologists and historians of religion dismiss this as animism, the most primitive, superstitious, and depraved of all those systems and beliefs which, in the course of historical progress, eventually blossom into Christianity or dialectical materialism. It is thus that our entire civilization has no respect for plants or for animals other","For as the nonsense of the madman is a babble of words for its own fascination, the nonsense of nature and of the sage is the perception that the ultimate meaningless of the world contains the same hidden joy as its transience and emptiness.","Running away from fear is fear, fighting pain is pain, trying to be brave is being scared. If the mind is in pain, the mind is pain. The thinker has no other form than his thought. There is no escape. But so long as you are not aware of the inseparability of thinker and thought, you will try to escape....Seeing that there is no escape from the pain, the mind yields to it, absorbs it, and becomes conscious of just pain without any \\"I\\" feeling it or resisting it. It experiences pain in the same complete, unselfconscious way in which it experiences pleasure.","[I]t is not quite true that one must wait for something to happen spontaneously. For the heart is beating, the breath is moving, and all the senses are perceiving. A whole world of experience is coming to the organism of itself, without the slightest forcing. This spontaneous arrival of experience is not actually passive; it is already spontaneous action.","Admitir, aceptar y reconocer realemente el mal en uno mismo, uno debe ser capaz de hacerlo sin verlo como un enemigo. hay que aceptar nuestro lado oscuro.","The pain is no longer problematic. I feel it, but there is no urge to get rid of it, for I have discovered that pain and the effort to be separate from it are the same thing.","Omul perfect \xee\u0219i folose\u0219te mintea ca pe o oglind\u0103. Nu apuc\u0103 nimic; nu refuz\u0103 nimic. Prime\u0219te, dar nu p\u0103streaz\u0103.","During World War II a friend of mine used to fly Chinese laborers over the Hump to work on the South end of the Burma Road. The long flight was, of course, ideal for gambling, but since there was not enough cash between them to make the game interesting, the stakes were that the final loser should jump off the plane. No parachute.","You can, indeed, refuse to admit this, but only at the cost of the immense and futile effort of spending your whole life resisting the inevitable","Hasta el punto en que una persona se haga consciente de que el mal esta tanto en el como en el otro, resultara menos pobable que proyecte sobre alguna cabeza de turco y comenta actos de violencia criminal contra los demas.","In the long run, hell and heaven are both seen to be traps, and final liberation comes with realizing that there is nothing to choose between them.","If we seek the meaning in the past, the chain of cause and effect vanishes like the wake of a ship. If we seek it in the future, it fades out like the beam of a searchlight in the night sky. If we seek it in the present, it is as elusive as flying spray, and there is nothing to grasp. But when only the seeking remains and we seek to know what this is, it suddenly turns into the mountains and waters, the sky and the stars, sufficient to themselves with no one left to seek anything from them.","Whatever villainies the British may have committed in India, their Christian consciences balked at the practice of sati, which required a widow to commit suicide at her husband\u2019s funeral. Truly civilized people are\u2014we feel\u2014not faces on the sky but fully enclosed heads containing souls, each one of infinite value in the sight of God.","[W]hen the knowledge and love of God is considered to exclude other goals and other creatures, God is actually put on a par with his creatures. The knowledge of God and the knowledge of creatures can exclude one another only if they are of the same kind. One must choose between yellow and blue, as two of the kind colour, but there is no need to choose between yellow and round, since what is round can also be yellow.","There is no rule but \\"Look!","There are, for instance, \u201cprimitive women who can deliver themselves of a child while working out in the fields, and, after doing the few things necessary to see that the baby is safe, warm, and comfortable, resume their work as before. On the other hand, the civilized woman has to be moved to a complicated hospital, and there, surrounded by doctors, nurses, and innumerable gadgets, force the poor thing into the world with prolonged contortions and excruciating pains. It is true that antiseptic conditions prevent many mothers and babies from dying, but why can\u2019t we have the antiseptic conditions and the natural, easy way of birth?\u201d","Todo el humor es fudamentalmente malicioso, pero existe una clase muy elevada de humor que consiste en reirse de uno mismo. El humor real no es hacer bromas a expensa de los demas, sino que siempre es a expensas de uno mismo, y claro, cuenta con elemento de malicia.","If God is universal, the knowledge of God should include all other knowledge as the sense of sight includes all the differing objects of vision. But if the eye should attempt to see sight, it will turn in upon itself and see nothing.","[T]he world of knowledge may, like Earth, be round-so that immersion in material particulars may quite unexpectedly lead back to the universal and the transcendent.","Perception thus narrowed has the advantage of being sharp and bright, but it has to focus on one area of the world after another, and one feature after another. And where there are no features, only space or uniform surfaces, it somehow gets bored and searches about for more features. Attention is therefore something like a scanning mechanism in radar or television, and Norbert Wiener and his colleagues found some evidence that there is a similar process in the brain."]')}}]);
