It isn\u2019t your room that\u2019s a prison, it\u2019s yourself.","It\'s a hell of a responsibility to be yourself. It\'s much easier to be somebody else or nobody at all.","Remember, remember, this is now, and now, and now. Live it, feel it, cling to it. I want to become acutely aware of all I\u2019ve taken for granted.","If you expect nothing from anybody, you\u2019re never disappointed.","I woke to the sound of rain.","Please don\u2019t expect me to always be good and kind and loving. There are times when I will be cold and thoughtless and hard to understand.","After all, we are nothing more or less than we choose to reveal.","If I didn\u2019t think, I\u2019d be much happier.","I didn\u2019t want any flowers, I only wanted To lie with my hands turned up and be utterly empty. How free it is, you have no idea how free\u2014\u2014 The peacefulness is so big it dazes you, And it asks nothing, a name tag, a few trinkets. It is what the dead close on, finally; I imagine them Shutting their mouths on it, like a Communion tablet.","So many people are shut up tight inside themselves like boxes, yet they would open up, unfolding quite wonderfully, if only you were interested in them.","It is a feeling that no matter what the ideas or conduct of others, there is a unique rightness and beauty to life which can be shared in openness, in wind and sunlight, with a fellow human being who believes in the same basic principles.","Your room is not your prison. You are.","I can never read all the books I want; I can never be all the people I want and live all the lives I want. I can never train myself in all the skills I want. And why do I want? I want to live and feel all the shades, tones and variations of mental and physical experience possible in life. And I am horribly limited.","I desire the things that will destroy me in the end.","What horrifies me most is the idea of being useless: well-educated, brilliantly promising, and fading out into an indifferent middle age.","The frost makes a flower, the dew makes a star.","I want to taste and glory in each day, and never be afraid to experience pain; and never shut myself up in a numb core of nonfeeling, or stop questioning and criticizing life and take the easy way out. To learn and think: to think and live; to live and learn: this always, with new insight, new understanding, and new love.","The hardest thing, I think, is to live richly in the present, without letting it be tainted & spoiled out of fear for the future or regret for a badly-managed past.","What I fear most, I think, is the death of the imagination.","O love, how did you get here?","Let me live, love and say it well in good sentences.","The constant struggle in mature life, I think, is to accept the necessity of tragedy and conflict, and not to try to escape to some falsely simple solution which does not include these more somber complexities.","I think I made you up inside my head.","We should meet in another life, we should meet in air, me and you.","Why can\u2019t I try on different lives, like dresses, to see which fits best and is more becoming?","When you give someone your whole heart and he doesn\'t want it, you cannot take it back.

Blackness and silence.","There is a certain unique and strange delight about walking down an empty street alone. There is an off-focus light cast by the moon, and the streetlights are part of the spotlight apparatus on a bare stage set up for you to walk through. You get a feeling of being listened to, so you talk aloud, softly, to see how it sounds.","I am not cruel, only truthful.","I am gone quite mad with the knowledge of accepting the overwhelming number of things I can never know, places I can never go, and people I can never be.","I shut my eyes and all the world drops dead; I lift my eyes and all is born again.","Oh, something is there, waiting for me. Perhaps someday the revelation will burst in upon me and I will see the other side of this monumental grotesque joke. And then I\'ll laugh. And then I\'ll know what life is.","Hour by hour, day by day, life becomes possible.","Compared with me, a tree is immortal.","I took a deep breath and listened to the old bray of my heart. I am. I am. I am.","It is so much safer not to feel, not to let the world touch me.","I wish you\u2019d find the exit out of my head.","I lean to you, numb as a fossil. Tell me I\'m here.","I am myself. That is not enough.","I do not know who I am, where I am going - and I am the one who has to decide the answers to these hideous questions.","Yes, I was infatuated with you: I am still. No one has ever heightened such a keen capacity of physical sensation in me. I cut you out because I couldn\'t stand being a passing fancy. Before I give my body, I must give my thoughts, my mind, my dreams. And you weren\'t having any of those.","I write only because There is a voice within me That will not be still","Perhaps some day I\'ll crawl back home, beaten, defeated. But not as long as I can make stories out of my heartbreak, beauty out of sorrow.","Kiss me and you will see how important I am.","And by the way, everything in life is writable about if you have the outgoing guts to do it, and the imagination to improvise. The worst enemy to creativity is self-doubt.","I have the choice of being constantly active and happy or introspectively passive and sad. Or I can go mad by ricocheting in between.","And when at last you find someone to whom you feel you can pour out your soul, you stop in shock at the words you utter\u2014 they are so rusty, so ugly, so meaningless and feeble from being kept in the small cramped dark inside you so long.","I love my rejection slips. They show me I try.","Wear your heart on your skin in this life.","I love people. Everybody. I love them, I think, as a stamp collector loves his collection. Every story, every incident, every bit of conversation is raw material for me.","Sometimes I feel like I\'m not solid. I\'m hollow. There\'s nothing behind my eyes. I\'m a negative of a person. All I want is blackness, blackness and silence.","See, the darkness is leaking from the cracks. I cannot contain it. I cannot contain my life.","I love life. But it is hard and I have so much, so very much to learn.","I must get my soul back from you; I am killing my flesh without it.","August rain: the best of the summer gone, and the new fall not yet born. The odd uneven time.","Can you understand? Someone, somewhere, can you understand me a little, love me a little? For all my despair, for all my ideals, for all that - I love life. But it is hard, and I have so much - so very much to learn.","I am afraid of getting older \u2026 I am afraid of getting married. Spare me from cooking three meals a day\u2014spare me from the relentless cage of routine and rote. I want to be free\u2026. I want, I want to think, to be omniscient\u2026. I think I would like to call myself \u2018The girl who wanted to be God.","I am terrified by this dark thing that sleeps in me.","So much working, reading, thinking, living to do! A lifetime is not long enough.","How we need another soul to cling to.","I don\u2019t care about anyone, and the feeling is quite obviously mutual.","I am what I feel and think and do.","How we need another soul to cling to, another body to keep us warm. To rest and trust; to give your soul in confidence: I need this, I need someone to pour myself into.","I have never found anybody who could stand to accept the daily demonstrative love I feel in me, and give back as good as I give.","But everybody has exactly the same smiling frightened face, with the look that says: \\"I\'m important. If you only get to know me, you will see how important I am. Look into my eyes. Kiss me, and you will see how important I am.","I wonder why I don\'t go to bed and go to sleep. But then it would be tomorrow, so I decide that no matter how tired, no matter how incoherent I am, I can skip on hour more of sleep and live.","You smile. No, it is not fatal.","Character is fate.","I felt like a racehorse in a world without racetracks.","I am afraid. I am not solid, but hollow. I feel behind my eyes a numb, paralyzed cavern, a pit of hell, a mimicking nothingness.","I fancied you\'d return the way you said,\\nBut I grow old and I forget your name.\\n(I think I made you up inside my head.)","Love is a shadow. How you lie and cry after it","If I rest, if I think inward, I go mad.","I do not fear it: I have been there.","Everything in life is writable.","I saw myself sitting in the crotch of this fig tree, starving to death, just because I couldn\'t make up my mind which of the figs I would choose. I wanted each and every one of them, but choosing one meant loosing all the rest, and, as I sat there, unable to decide, the figs began to wrinkle and go black, and, one by one, they plopped to the ground at my feet.","I am still so na\xefve; I know pretty much what I like and dislike; but please, don\u2019t ask me who I am. A passionate, fragmentary girl, maybe?","I shut my eyes and all the world drops dead; I lift my lids and all is born again. (I think I made you up inside my head.) The stars go waltzing out in blue and red, And arbitrary blackness gallops in: I shut my eyes and all the world drops dead. I dreamed that you bewitched me into bed And sung me moon-struck, kissed me quite insane. (I think I made you up inside my head.)","The claw of the magnolia, drunk on its own scents, asks nothing of life.","We must be moving, working, making dreams to run toward; the poverty of life without dreams is too horrible to imagine.","My worst habit is my fear & my destructive rationalizing.","The slime of all my yesterdays rots in the hollow of my skull.","What a man wants is a mate and what a woman wants is infinite security.","Well, I know now. I know a little more how much a simple thing like a snowfall can mean to a person","* to know a lot of people I love pieces of, and to want to synthesize those pieces in me somehow, be it by painting or writing. * to know that millions of others are unhappy and that life is a gentleman\'s agreement to grin and paint your face gay so others will feel they are silly to be unhappy, and try to catch the contagion of joy, while inside so many are dying of bitterness and unfulfillment.","I have to live my life, and it is the only one I\u2019ll ever have.","The sky leans on me, me, the one upright among all horizontals.","The trouble was, I had been inadequate all along, I simply hadn\'t thought about it.","Perhaps when we find ourselves wanting everything, it is because we are dangerously close to wanting nothing.","Hurl yourself at goals above your head and bear the lacerations that come when you slip and make a fool of yourself. Try always, as long as you have breath in your body, to take the hard way\u2013and work, work, work to build yourself into a rich, continually evolving entity.","And I a smiling woman. I am only thirty. And like the cat I have nine times to die.","I want to write because I have the urge to excel in one medium of translation and expression of life. I can\'t be satisfied with the colossal job of merely living. Oh, no, I must order life in sonnets and sestinas and provide a verbal reflector for my 60-watt lighted head.","It was my first big chance, but here I was, sitting back and letting it run through my fingers like so much water.","I have no preconceptions. Whatever I see, I swallow immediately. Just as it is, unmisted by love or dislike. I am not cruel, only truthful.","And, I think: I am but one more drop in the great sea of matter, defined, with the ability to realize my existence. Of the millions, I, too, was potentially everything at birth. I, too, was stunted, narrowed, warped, by my environment, my outcroppings of heredity. I, too, will find a set of beliefs, of standards to live by, yet the very satisfaction of finding them will be marred by the fact that I have reached the ultimate in shallow, two-dimensional living \u2014 a set of values.","I felt my lungs inflate with the onrush of scenery\u2014air, mountains, trees, people. I thought, \\"This is what it is to be happy.","I felt dull and flat and full of shattered visions.","It was sometime in October; she had long ago lost track of all the days and it really didn\u2019t matter because one was like another and there were no nights to separate them because she never slept any more.","Yes, my consuming desire is to mingle with road crews, sailors and soldiers, barroom regulars - to be a part of a scene, anonymous, listening, recording - all this is spoiled by the fact that I am a girl, a female always supposedly in danger of assault and battery. My consuming interest in men and their lives is often misconstrued as a desire to seduce them, or as an invitation to intimacy. Yes, God, I want to talk to everybody as deeply as I can. I want to be able to sleep in an open field, to travel west, to walk freely at night.","Nothing stinks like a pile of unpublished writing.","Very depressed today. Unable to write a thing. Menacing gods. I feel outcast on a cold star, unable to feel anything but an awful helpless numbness.","That\u2019s one of the reasons I never wanted to get married. The last thing I wanted was infinite security and to be the place an arrow shoots off from. I wanted change and excitement and to shoot off in all directions myself, like the colored arrows from a Fourth of July rocket.","You\'ve only got so long to live.","I lay and cried, and began to feel again, to admit I was human, vulnerable, sensitive. I began to remember how it had been before; how there was that germ of positive creativeness. Character is fate; and damn, I\'d better work on my character. I had been withdrawing into a retreat of numbness: it is so much safer to NOT feel, NOT to let the world touch one.","Cheers for spring; for life; for a growing soul.","Tomorrow is another day toward death.","That is salvation. To give of love inside. To keep love of life, no matter what, and give to others. Generously.","I knew you\'d decide to be all right again.","I don\'t see what women see in other women,\\" I\'d told Doctor Nolan in my interview that noon. \\"What does a woman see in a woman that she can\'t see in a man?\\" Doctor Nolan paused. Then she said, \\"Tenderness.","I must say what I admire most is the person who masters an area of practical experience, and can teach me something. I mean, my local midwife has taught me how to keep bees. Well, she can\'t understand anything I write. And I find myself liking her, may I say, more than most poets. And among my friends I find people who know all about boats or know all about certain sports, or how to cut somebody open and remove an organ. I\'m fascinated by this mastery of the practical.","I sank back in the gray, plush seat and closed my eyes. The air of the bell jar wadded round me and I couldn\'t stir.","Life has been some combination of fairy-tale coincidence and joie de vivre and shocks of beauty together with some hurtful self-questioning.","If only I knew what I wanted I could try to see about getting it.","Dying Is an art, like everything else. I do it exceptionally well.","...we shall board our imagined ship and wildly sail among sacred islands of the mad till death shatters the fabulous stars and makes us real.","Before I give my body, I must give my thoughts, my mind, my dreams.","I want so obviously, so desperately to be loved, and to be capable of love.","I think the whole emphasis in England, in universities, on practical criticism (but not that so much as on historical criticism, knowing what period a line comes from) this is almost paralysing. In America, in University, we read - what? - T. S. Eliot, Dylan Thomas, Yeats, that is where we began. Shakespeare flaunted in the background. I\'m not sure I agree with this, but I think that\' for the young poet, the writing poet, it is not quite so frightening to go to university in America as it is in England, for these reasons.","You cannot regard your own life with objective curiosity all the time.","I want to be important. By being different. And these girls are all the same.","I have stitched life into me like a rare organ","I felt very still and empty, the way the eye of a tornado must feel, moving dully along in the middle of the surrounding hullabaloo.","No day is safe from news of you.","How can you be so many women to so many strange people, oh you strange girl?","Out of the ash I rise with my red hair and I eat men like air.","I wanted to be where nobody I knew could ever come.","Eternity bores me, I never wanted it.","I dream too much, work too little.","I am jealous of those who think more deeply, who write better, who draw better, who ski better, who look better, who live better, who love better than I.","Some pale, hueless flicker of sensitivity is in me. God, must I lose it in cooking scrambled eggs for a man.","I smile, now, thinking: we all like to think we are important enough to need psychiatrists","I do not love; I do not love anybody except myself. That is a rather shocking thing to admit. I have none of the selfless love of my mother. I have none of the plodding, practical love. . . . . I am, to be blunt and concise, in love only with myself, my puny being with its small inadequate breasts and meager, thin talents. I am capable of affection for those who reflect my own world.","Let me not be weak and tell others how bleeding I am internally; how day by day it drips, and gathers, and congeals.","It is as if my life were magically run by two electric currents: joyous positive and despairing negative--which ever is running at the moment dominates my life, floods it.","Can you understand? Someone, somewhere, can you understand me a little, love me a little?","Nothing is real except the present, and already, I feel the weight of centuries smothering me. Some girl a hundred years ago once lived as I do. And she is dead. I am the present, but I know I, too, will pass. The high moment, the burning flash, come and are gone, continuous quicksand. And I don\u2019t want to die.","I know the bottom, she says. I know it with my great tap root: It is what you fear. I do not fear it: I have been there.","Aloneness and selfness are too important to betray for company.","My mother said the cure for thinking too much about yourself was helping somebody who was worse off than you.","So, now I shall talk every night. To myself. To the moon. I shall walk, as I did tonight, jealous of my loneliness, in the blue-silver of the cold moon, shining brilliantly on the drifts of fresh-fallen snow, with the myriad sparkles. I talk to myself and look at the dark trees, blessedly neutral. So much easier than facing people, than having to look happy, invulnerable, clever.","The body is amazingly stubborn when it comes to sacrificing itself to the annihilating directions of the mind.","Winning or losing an argument, receiving an acceptance or rejection, is no proof of the validity or value of personal identity. One may be wrong, mistaken, or a poor craftsman, or just ignorant - but this is no indication of the true worth of one\'s total human identity: past, present and future!","What did my fingers do before they held him? What did my heart do, with its love?","I thought the most beautiful thing in the world must be shadow, the million moving shapes and cul-de-sacs of shadow. There was shadow in bureau drawers and closets and suitcases, and shadow under houses and trees and stones, and shadow at the back of people\'s eyes and smiles, and shadow, miles and miles and miles of it, on the night side of the earth.","I felt like a racehorse in a world without racetracks or a champion college footballer suddenly confronted by Wall Street and a business suit, his days of glory shrunk to a little gold cup on his mantel with a date engraved on it like the date on a tombstone.","The silence depressed me. It wasn\'t the silence of silence. It was my own silence.","Pretty soon, the only doubt in my mind was the precise time and method of committing suicide. The only alternative I could see was an eternity of hell for the rest of my life in a mental hospital, and I was going to use my last ounce of free choice and choose a quick clean ending.","I find that in a novel I can get more of life, perhaps not such intense life, but certainly more of life than in poetry.","So learn about life. Cut yourself a big slice with the silver server, a big slice of pie. Open your eyes. Let life happen.","I have a violence in me that is hot as death-blood.","Clouds pass and disperse. Are those the faces of love, those pale irretrievables? Is it for such I agitate my heart?","Happy! That is indefinable as far as states of being go.","Please, I want so badly for the good things to happen.","What I cannot forgive is dishonesty - and no matter what, or how hard, I would rather know the truth of which I today had such a clear & devastating vision from his mouth than hear foul evasions, blurrings and rattiness.","Here I am, a bundle of past recollections and future dreams, knotted up in a reasonably attractive bundle of flesh. I remember what this flesh has gone through; I dream of what it may go through.","Please let him come, and give me the resilience & guts to make him respect me, be interested, and not to throw myself at him with loudness or hysterical yelling; calmly, gently, easy baby easy. He is probably strutting the backs among crocuses now with seven Scandinavian mistresses. And I sit, spiderlike, waiting, here, home; Penelope weaving webs of Webster, turning spindles of Tourneur. Oh, he is here; my black marauder; oh hungry hungry. I am so hungry for a big smashing creative burgeoning burdened love: I am here; I wait; and he plays on the banks of the river Cam like a casual faun.","The moon is no door. It is a face in its own right, White as a knuckle and terribly upset. It drags the sea after it like a dark crime; it is quiet With the O-gape of complete despair. I live here.","I\'m sarcastic, skeptical, and sometimes callous because I\'m still afraid, deep down, of letting myself be hurt.","I could never be a complete scholar or a complete housewife ora completewriter: Imustcombinea little of all, and thereby be imperfect in all.","The abstract kills, the concrete saves.","Don\'t let the wicked city get you down.","I didn\u2019t want my picture taken because I was going to cry. I didn\u2019t know why I was going to cry, but I knew that if anybody spoke to me or looked at me too closely the tears would fly out of my eyes and the sobs would fly out of my throat and I\u2019d cry for a week. I could feel the tears brimming and sloshing in me like water in a glass that is unsteady and too full.","Oh what a poet I will flay myself into.","I wanted to crawl in between those black lines of print, the way you crawl through a fence, and go to sleep under that beautiful big green fig-tree.","I said: I must remember this, being small.","Only I wasn\'t steering anything, not even myself.","I must not be selfless: develop a sense of self. A solidness that can\'t be attacked.","My thoughts are crabbed and sallow,\\nMy tears like vinegar,\\nOr the bitter blinking yellow\\nOf an acetic star.\\nTonight the caustic wind, love,\\nGossips late and soon,\\nAnd I wear the wry-faced pucker of\\nThe sour lemon moon.\\nWhile like an early summer plum,\\nPuny, green, and tart,\\nDroops upon its wizened stem\\nMy lean, unripened heart.","\u2026I hate myself for not being able to go downstairs naturally and seek comfort in numbers. I hate myself for having to sit here and be torn between I know not what within me.","It is awful to want to go away and to want to go nowhere.","Worse even than your maddening song, your silence.","The blood of love welled up in my heart with a slow pain.","What is my life for and what am I going to do with it? I don\'t know and I\'m afraid. I can never read all the books I want; I can never be all the people I want and live all the lives I want.","The worst enemy to creativity is self-doubt.","It is a terrible thing to be so open: it is as if my heart put on a face and walked into the world.","There is nothing like puking with somebody to make you into old friends.","The first time it happened I was ten.\\nIt was an accident.\\n\\nThe second time I meant\\nTo last it out and not come back at all.\\nI rocked shut\\n\\nAs a seashell.\\nThey had to call and call\\nAnd pick the worms off me like sticky pearls.\\n\\nDying\\nIs an art, like everything else.\\nI do it exceptionally well.\\n\\nI do it so it feels like hell.\\nI do it so it feels real.\\nI guess you could say I\'ve a call.","I felt myself melting into the shadows like the negative of a person I\'d never seen before in my life.","One thing, I try to be honest. And what is revealed is often rather hideously unflattering.","I opened the door and blinked out into the bright hall. I had the impression it wasn\'t night and it wasn\'t day, but some lurid third interval that had suddenly slipped between them and would never end.","I am dead to them, even though I once flowered.","I am too pure for you or anyone.","We stayed at home to write, to consolidate our outstretched selves.","I\'m about fifty years behind as far as my preferences go and I must say that the poets who excite me most are the Americans. There are very few contemporary English poets that I admire.","Doreen had intuition. Everything she said was like a secret voice speaking straight out of my own bones.","If every soldier refused to take arms ... there would be no wars; but no one has the courage to be the first to live according to Christ and Socrates, because in a world of opportunists they would be martyred.","Let\'s face it: I\'m scared, scared and frozen. First, I guess, I\'m afraid for myself ... the old primitive urge for survival. It\'s getting so I live every moment with terrible intensity. Last night, driving back from Boston, I lay back in the car and let the colored lights come at me, the music from the radio, the reflection of the guy driving. It all flowed over me with a screaming ache of pain ... remember, remember, this is now, and now, and now. Live it, feel it, cling to it. I want to become acutely aware of all I\'ve taken for granted. When you feel that this may be the good-bye, the last time, it hits you harder.","I can\'t think logically about who I am or where I am going. I have been very ecstatic, horribly depressed, shocked, elated, enlightened, and enervated.","I had imagined a kind, ugly, intuitive man looking up and say, \'Ah!\' in an encouraging way, as if he could see something I couldn\'t, and then I would find words to tell him how I was so scared, as if I were being stuffed farther and farther into a black, airless sack with no way out.","People or stars Regard me sadly, I disappoint them.","I want to be able to sleep in an open field, to travel west, to walk freely at night.","I like people too much or not at all.","If the body is a temple, then tattoos are its stained glass windows.","Spiderlike, I spin mirrors, Loyal to my image.","She stared at her reflection in the glossed shop windows as if to make sure, moment by moment, that she continued to exist.","Every day is precious and I feel infinitely sad at this time melting away from me.","If neurotic is wanting two mutually exclusive things at one and the same time, then I\'m neurotic as hell.","Why am I obsessed with the idea I can justify myself by getting manuscripts published? Is it an escape-an excuse for any social failure-so I can say \\"No, I don\'t go out for many extracurricular activities, but I spend a lot of time writing.\\"","A man\'s world is different from a woman\'s world and a man\'s emotions are different from a woman\'s emotions and only marriage can bring the two different sets of emotions together properly.","There is something demoralizing about watching two people get more and more crazy about each other, especially when you are the only extra person in the room.","The moon, also, is merciless: she would drag me\\nCruelly, being barren.\\nHer radiance scathes me. Or perhaps I have caught her.","I find myself absolutely fulfilled when I have written a poem, when I\'m writing one. Having written one, then you fall away very rapidly from having been a poet to becoming a sort of poet in rest, which isn\'t the same thing at all. But I think the actual experience of writing a poem is a magnificent one.","I wonder about all the roads not taken and am moved to quote Frost...but won\'t. It is sad to be able only to mouth other poets. I want someone to mouth me.","The sheets grow heavy as a lecher\'s kiss.","I may never be happy, but tonight I am content. Nothing more than an empty house, the warm hazy weariness from a day spent setting strawberry runners in the sun, a glass of cool sweet milk, and a shallow dish of blueberries bathed in cream. When one is so tired at the end of a day one must sleep, and at the next dawn there are more strawberry runners to set, and so one goes on living, near the earth. At times like this I\'d call myself a fool to ask for more.","There is a certain clinical satisfaction in seeing just how bad things can get.","I feel, am mad as any writer must in one way be; why not make it real? I am too close to the bourgeois society of suburbia: too close to people I know I must sever my self from them, or be a part of their world: this half and half compromise is intolerable.","I think my poems immediately come out of the sensuous and emotional experiences I have, but I must say I cannot sympathise with these cries from the heart that are informed by nothing except a needle or a knife, or whatever it is.","So you got rid of your astonishment that someone could write so much more dynamically than you. You stopped cherishing your aloneness and poetic differentness to your delicately flat little bosom. You said: she\'s to good to forget. How about making her a friend and competitor \u2014 you could learn alot from her. So you\'ll try. So maybe she\'ll laugh in your face. So maybe she\'ll beat you hollow in the end. So anyhow, you\'ll try, and maybe, possibly, she can stand you. Here\'s hoping!","... stop trying to get me to write about \'decent courageous people\' -- read the Ladies\' Home Journal for those! ... I believe in going through and facing the worst, not hiding from it.","Ash, ash \u2014- You poke and stir. Flesh, bone, there is nothing there\u2014\u2014 A cake of soap, A wedding ring, A gold filling. Herr God, Herr Lucifer Beware Beware. Out of the ash I rise with my red hair And I eat men like air.","I felt overstuffed and dull and disappointed, the way I always do the day after Christmas.","Sure, I\u2019m dramatic and sloppily semi-cynical and semi-sentimental. But, in leisure years I could grow and choose my way. Now I am living on the edge. We all are on the brink, and it takes a lot of nerve, a lot of energy, to teeter on the edge, looking over, looking down into the windy blackness and not being quite able to make out, through the yellow, stinking mist, just what lies below in the slime, in the oozing, vomit-streaked slime; and so I could go on, my thoughts, writing much, trying to find the core, the meaning for myself.","When they asked some old Roman philosopher or other how he wanted to die, he said he would open his veins in a warm bath. I thought it would be easy, lying in the tup and seeing the redness flower from my wrists, flush after flush through the clear water, till I sank into sleep under a surface gaudy as poppies.","It was like the first time i saw a cadaver. For weeks afterward the cadavers head, or what was left of it - floated up behind my eggs and bacon at breakfast and in the face of Buddy Willard, who was responsible for my seeing it in the first place, and pretty soon I felt as though I were carrying that cadavers head around with me on a string, like some black, noseless balloon stinking of vinegar.","I cannot life for life itself: but for the words which stay the flux. My life, I feel, will not be lived until there are books and stories which relive it perpetually in time. I forget too easily how it was, and shrink to the horror of the here and now, with no past and no future. Writing breaks open the vaults of the dead and the skies behind which the prophesying angels hide. The mind makes and makes, spinning its web.","You have lost all delight in life. Ahead is a large array of blind alleys. You are half-deliberately, half-desperately cutting off your grip on creative life. You are becoming a neuter machine. You cannot love, even if you knew how to begin to love. Every thought is a devil, a hell-if you could do a lot of things over again, ah, how differently you would do them! You want to go home, back to the womb. You watch the world bang door after door in your face, numbly, bitterly. You have forgotten the secret you knew, once, ah, once, of being joyous, of laughing, of opening doors.","God, is this all it is, the ricocheting down the corridor of laughter and tears? Of self-worship and self-loathing? Of glory and disgust?","So much working, reading, thinking, living to do. A lifetime is not long enough. Nor youth to old age long enough. Immortality and permanence be damned. Sure I want them, but they are nonexistent, and won\'t matter when I rot underground. All I want to say is: I made the best of a mediocre job. It was a good fight while it lasted. And so life goes.","As a poet, one lives a bit on air. I always like someone who can teach me something practical.","I wanted to tell her that if only something were wrong with my body it would be fine, I would rather have anything wrong with my body than something wrong with my head, but the idea seemed so involved and wearisome that I didn\u2019t say anything. I only burrowed down further in the bed.","Is anyone anywhere happy?","The sickness rolled through me in great waves. After each wave it would fade away and leave me limp as a wet leaf and shivering all over and then I would feel it rising up in me again, and the glittering white torture chamber tiles under my feet and over my head and all four sides closed in and squeezed me to pieces.","Perhaps you considered yourself an oracle, Mouthpiece of the dead, or of some god or other. Thirty years now I have labored To dredge the silt from your throat. I am none the wiser.","God, but life is loneliness, despite all the opiates, despite the shrill tinsel gaiety of \\"parties\\" with no purpose, despite the false grinning faces we all wear. And when at last you find someone to whom you feel you can pour out your soul, you stop in shock at the words you utter - they are so rusty, so ugly, so meaningless and feeble from being kept in the small cramped dark inside you so long. Yes, there is joy, fulfillment and companionship - but the loneliness of the soul in its appalling self-consciousness is horrible and overpowering.","When they asked me what I wanted to be I said I didn\'t know.","I dreamed that you bewitched me into bed And sung me moon-struck, kissed me quite insane. (I think I made you up inside my head.)","I felt overstuffed and dull and disappointed, the way I always do the day after Christmas, as if whatever it was the pine boughs and the candles and the silver and gilt-ribboned presents and the birch-log fires and the Christmas turkey and the carols at the piano promised never came to pass.","At this rate, I\'d be lucky if I wrote a page a day. Then I knew what the problem was. I needed experience. How could I write about life when I\'d never had a love affair or a baby or even seen anybody die? A girl I knew had just won a prize for a short story about her adventures among the pygmies in Africa. How could I compete with that sort of thing?","I always was interested in prose. As a teenager, I published short stories. And I always wanted to write the long short story, I wanted to write a novel. Now that I have attained, shall I say, a respectable age, and have had experiences, I feel much more interested in prose, in the novel. I feel that in a novel, for example, you can get in toothbrushes and all the paraphernalia that one finds in dally life, and I find this more difficult in poetry.","A skeptic, I would ask for consistency first of all.","To learn and think; to think and live; to live and learn: this always, with new insight, new understanding, and new love.","I keep wanting to crawl back into the womb.","The silence between us was so profound I thought part of it must be my fault.","Joy:show joy & enjoy: then others will be joyful.","I felt very low. I had been unmasked only that morning by Jay Cee herself, and I felt now that all the uncomfortable suspicions I had about myself were coming true. After nineteen years of running after good marks and prizes and grants of one sort and another, I was letting up, slowing down, dropping clean out of race.","There is a charge For the eyeing of my scars, there is a charge For the hearing of my heart - It really goes. And there is a charge, a very large charge, For a word or a touch Or a bit of blood Or a piece of my hair or my clothes.","I have suffered the atrocity of sunsets.","When you are insane, you are busy being insane-all the time ... when I was crazy, that was all I was.","I am still raw. I say I may be back. You know what lies are for. Even in your Zen heaven we shan\'t meet.","I must learn more about these people\u2015try to understand them, put myself in their place. No, instead I am so busy keeping my head above water that I scarcely know who I am, much less who anyone else is.","I feel terribly vulnerable and \'not-myself\' when I\'m not writing.","I need not to be more with others, but to be more & more deeply, richly alone. Recreating worlds.","I ride earth\'s burning carousel. Day in, day out.","Everything people did seemed so silly, because they only died in the end.","And the danger is that in this move toward new horizons and far directions, that I may lose what I have now, and not find anything except loneliness","What did my arms do before they held you?","Living with him is like being told a perpetual story: his mind is the biggest, most imaginative I have ever met. I could live in its growing countries forever.","And I sit here without identity: faceless. My head aches.","Why the hell are we conditioned into the smooth strawberry-and-cream Mother-Goose-world, Alice-in-Wonderland fable, only to be broken on the wheel as we grow older and become aware of ourselves as individuals with a dull responsibility in life?","Is there no way out of the mind?","..I fancied you\'d return the way you said, But I grow old and I forget your name. (I think I made you up inside my head.) I should have loved a thunderbird instead; At least when spring comes they roar back again. I shut my eyes and all the world drops dead. (I think I made you up inside my head.)","If you love her\\", I said, \\"you\'ll love somebody else someday.","I talk to God but the sky is empty.","I shall never get out of this! There are two of me now: This new absolutely white person and the old yellow one, And the white person is certainly the superior one. She doesn\'t need food, she is one of the real saints. At the beginning I hated her, she had no personality- She lay in bed with me like a dead body And I was scared, because she was shaped just the way I was only much whiter and unbreakable and with no complaints. I couldn\'t sleep for a week she was so cold.","because wherever I sat\u2014on the deck of a ship or at a street caf\xe9 in Paris or Bangkok\u2014I would be sitting under the same glass bell jar, stewing in my own sour air.","Love is the bone and sinew of my curse.","Why do we electrocute men for murdering an individual and then pin a purple heart on them for mass slaughter of someone arbitrarily labeled \u201cenemy?","Love set you going like a fat gold watch. The midwife slapped your footsoles, and your bald cry Took its place among the elements.","Perfection is terrible, it cannot have children.","I want to live and feel all the shades, tones and variations of mental and physical experience possible in life.","I am sure there are things that can\'t be cured by a good bath but I can\'t think of one.","There is more than one good way to drown.","I am not a historian, but I find myself being more and more fascinated by history and now I find myself reading more and more about history. I am very interested in Napoleon, at the present: I\'m very interested in battles, in wars, in Gallipoli, the First World War and so on, and I think that as I age I am becoming more and more historical. I certainly wasn\'t at all in my early twenties.","I hate handing over money to people for doing what I could just as easily do myself, it makes me nervous.","I like people too much or not at all. I\'ve got to go down deep, to fall into people, to really know them.","Dancing is the normal prelude to intercourse.","There is no life higher than the grasstops","I guess they call it suicide, but I\'m to full to swallow my pride I can\'t stand losing you The Police Dying is an art, like everything else. I do it exceptionally well.","Jealousy can open the blood, it can make black roses.","Apparently, the most difficult feat for a Cambridge male is to accept a woman not merely as feeling, not merely as thinking, but as managing a complex, vital interweaving of both.","It never occurred to me to say no.","Even amidst fierce flames the golden lotus can be planted.","I may never be happy, but tonight I am content.","I have been holding a dialogue with myself and girding myself to stand fast without running.","I collect men with interesting names.","I\u2019ll never speak to God again.","If the moon smiled, she would resemble you. You leave the same impression Of something beautiful, but annihilating.","The floor seemed wonderfully solid. It was comforting to know I had fallen and could fall no farther.","The future is what matters \u2014 because one never reaches it, but always stays in the present \u2014 like the White Queen who had to run like the wind to remain in the same spot.","If you pluck out my heart To find what makes it move, You\u2019ll halt the clock That syncopates our love.","I feel self-repressed again. The old fall disease. Where is my willpower? The idea of a life gets in the way of my life...I dream too much, work too little.","When they asked me what I wanted to be I said I didn\u2019t know. \\"Oh, sure you know,\\" the photographer said. \\"She wants,\\" said Jay Cee wittily, \\"to be everything.","A million years of evolution, Eric said bitterly, and what are we? Animals.","Is it the sea you hear in me? Its dissatisfactions? Or the voice of nothing, that was your madness? Love is a shadow. How you lie and cry after it.","Last year a friend went dark in a nervous city alone, the sea flashing against his glasses, the sea sorted out at last in his inner ear so he could leave this world as he\'d entered it through the undependable irrational influence of water. -Kevin Jeffery Clark It was as if what I wanted to kill wasn\'t in that skin or the thin blue pulse that jumped under my thumb, but somewhere else, deeper, more secret, and a whole lot harder to get at.","How frail the human heart must be - a mirrored pool of thought.","And I am aware of my heart: it opens and closes Its bowl of red blooms out of sheer love of me.","I was supposed to be having the time of my life.","I began to think vodka was my drink at last. It didn\u2019t taste like anything, but it went straight down into my stomach like a sword swallowers\u2019 sword and made me feel powerful and godlike.","The truth comes to me. The truth loves me.","What have I eaten? Lies and smiles.","The box is only temporary.","I saw the days of the year stretching ahead like a series of bright, white boxes, and separating one box from another was sleep, like a black shade. Only for me, the long perspective of shades that set off one box from the next day had suddenly snapped up, and I could see day after day after day glaring ahead of me like a white, broad, infinitely desolate avenue.","There is a certain unique and strange delight about walking down an empty street alone.","The thought that I might kill myself formed in my mind coolly as a tree or a flower.","I want to force myself again and again to leave the warmth and security of static situations and move into the world of growth and suffering where the real books are people\'s minds and souls.","I am solitary as grass. What is it I miss? Shall I ever find it, whatever it is?","Feel oddly barren. My sickness is when words draw in their horns and the physical world refuses to be ordered, recreated, arranged and selected. I am a victim of it then, not a master.","There ought, I thought, to be a ritual for being born twice - patched, retreaded and approved for the road.","I am disabused of all faith, and see too clearly.","I didn\u2019t want any flowers, I only wanted to lie with my hands turned up and be utterly empty. How free it is, you have no idea how free.","I want, I think, to be omniscient. I think I would like to call myself \\"the girl who wanted to be God.\\" Yet if I were not in this body where would I be-perhaps I am destined to be classified and qualified. But, oh, I cry out against it.","But when it came right down to it, the skin of my wrist looked so white and defensless that I couldn\'t do it. It was as if what I wanted to kill wasn\'t in that skin or the thin blue pulse that jumped under my thumb, but somewhere else, deeper, more secret, and a whole lot harder to get.","I believe that one should be able to control and manipulate experiences, even the most terrifying, like madness, being tortured...with an informed and intelligent mind.","And I, love, am a pathological liar.","I wanted to do everything once and for all and be through with it.","You have to be able to make a real creative life for Yourself, before you can expect anyone Else to provide one ready-made for you.","Yes, there is joy, fulfillment and companionship but the loneliness of the soul in its appalling self-consciousness is horrible and overpowering.","Poetry, I feel, is a tyrannical discipline. You\'ve got to go so far, so fast, in such a small space, that you\'ve got to burn away all the peripherals.","There is so much hurt in this game of searching for a mate, of testing, trying. And you realize suddenly that you forgot it was a game, and turn away in tears.","I collected men with interesting names. I already knew a Socrates. He was tall and ugly and intellectual and the son of some big Greek movie producer in Hollywood, but also a Catholic, which ruined it for both of us.","That afternoon my mother had brought me the roses. \\"Save them for my funeral,\\" I\'d said.","A ring of gold with the sun in it? Lies. Lies and a grief.","I thought if only I had a keen, shapely bone structure to my face or could discuss politics shrewdly or was a famous writer Constantin might find me interesting enough to sleep with. And then I wondered if as soon as he came to like me he would sink into ordinariness, and if as soon as he came to love me I would find fault, the way I did with Buddy Willard and the boys before him.","I am learning peacefulness, lying by myself quietly, as the light lies on these white walls, this bed, these hands. I am nobody; I have nothing to do with explosions.","I have done, this year, what I said I would: overcome my fear of facing a blank page day after day, acknowledging myself, in my deepest emotions, a writer, come what may.","To the person in the bell jar, blank and stopped as a dead baby, the world itself is a bad dream.","I want to become acutely aware of all I\'ve taken for granted.","I had been alone more than I could have been had I gone by myself.","I thought the most beautiful thing in the world must be shadow.","The thing about writing is not to talk, but to do it; no matter how bad or even mediocre it is, the process and production is the thing, not the sitting and theorizing about how one should write ideally, or how well one could write if one really wanted to or had the time.","There is something demoralizing about watching two people get more and more crazy about each other, especially when you are the only extra person in the room. It\'s like watching Paris from an express caboose heading in the opposite direction--every second the city gets smaller and smaller, only you feel it\'s really you getting smaller and smaller and lonelier and lonelier, rushing away from all those lights and excitement at about a million miles an hour.","A dispassionate white sun shone at the summit of the sky. I wanted to hone myself on it till I grew saintly and thin and essential as the blade of a knife.","To annihilate the world by annihilation of oneself is the deluded height of desperate egoism.","This is newness: every little tawdry Obstacle glass-wrapped and peculiar, Glinting and clinking in a saint\'s falsetto. Only you Don\'t know what to make of the sudden slippiness, The blind, white, awful, inaccessible slant. There\'s no getting up it by the words you know. No getting up by elephant or wheel or shoe. We have only come to look. You are too new To want the world in a glass hat.","Sometimes I feel so stupid and dull and uncreative that I am amazed when people tell me differently.","If I didn\'t think, I\'d be much happier; if I didn\'t have any sex organs, I wouldn\'t waver on the brink of nervous emotion and tears all the time.","I wondered why I couldn\'t go the whole way doing what I should any more. This made me sad and tired. Then I wondered why I couldn\'t go the whole way doing what I shouldn\'t, the way Doreen did, and this made me even sadder and more tired.","I am sending back the key that let me into bluebeard\'s study; because he would make love to me I am sending back the key; in his eye\'s darkroom I can see my X-rayed heart, dissected body: I am sending back the key that let me into bluebeard s study.","A fierce brief fusion which dreamers call real, and realists, an illusion; an insight like the flight of birds.","The moon, too, abases her subjects, but in the daytime she is ridiculous. Your dissatisfactions, on the other hand, arrive through the mailslot with loving regularity, white and blank, expansive as carbon monoxide. No day is safe from news of you, walking about in Africa maybe, but thinking of me.","I wish to cry. Yet, I laugh, and my lipstick leaves a red stain like a bloody crescent moon on top of the beer can","Now I know what loneliness is, I think. Momentary loneliness, anyway. It comes from a vague core of the self - - like a disease of the blood, dispersed throughout the body so that one cannot locate the matrix, the spot of contagion.","But I am I now; and so many other millions are so irretrievably their own special variety of \'I\' that I can hardly bear to think of it. I: how firm a letter; how reassuring the three strokes: one vertical, proud and assertive, and then the two short horizontal lines in quick, smug succession. The pen scratching on the paper\u2026I\u2026I\u2026I\u2026I\u2026I\u2026I.","Beached under the spumy blooms, we lie Sea-sick and fever-dry.","Strange, when one thinks of all the other boys, infinite experimental kisses, test tube infatuations, crushes, pseudo-loves. All through this physical separation, through the testing and the trying of the others, there has been this peculiar rapport, comradeship, of us two so alike, so similar, but for science-boy and humanities-girl - the introspection, self examination, biannual deep summarizing conversations, and then the platonic parting.","I have let things slip, a thirty-year~old cargo boat Stubbornly hanging on to my name and address.","Not easy to state the change you made. If I\'m alive now, I was dead, Though, like a stone, unbothered by it.","I think if I had done anything else I would like to have been a doctor. This is the sort of polar opposition to being a writer, I suppose.","All the heat and fear had purged itself. I felt surprisingly at peace. The bell jar hung suspended a few feet above my head. I was open to the circulating air.","But I wasn\'t sure. I wasn\'t sure at all. How did I know that someday\u2015at college, in Europe, somewhere, anywhere\u2015the bell jar, with its stifling distortions, wouldn\'t descend again?","In this particular tub, two knees jut up like icebergs, while minute brown hairs rise on arms and legs in a fringe of kelp; green soap navigates the tidal slosh of seas breaking on legendary beaches; in faith we shall board our imagined ship and wildly sail among sacred islands of the mad till death shatters the fabulous stars and makes us real.","I have taken a pill to kill The thin Papery feeling.","Winter is for women The woman still at her knitting, At the cradle of Spanish walnut, Her body a bulb in the cold and too dumb to think.","I\'ve eaten a bag of Green apples. Boarded the train, there\'s no getting off","It won\'t happen yet, Ellen mused, mashing cooked carrots for Jill\'s lunch. Breakups seldom do. It will unfold slowly, one little tell-tale symptom after another like some awful, hellish flower.","What I want back is what I was Before the bed, before the knife, Before the brooch-pin and the salve Fixed me in this parenthesis; Horses fluent in the wind, A place, a time gone out of mind.","If I have a dry spell ... I wait and live harder, eyes, ears, and heart open, and when the productive time comes, it is that much richer.","When I fell out of the light, I entered The stomach of indifference, the wordless cupboard.","Ironically, Henry James\' biography comforts me & I long to make known to him his posthumous reputation he wrote, in pain, gave all his life (which is more than I could think of doing I have Ted, will have children but few friends) & the critics insulted & mocked him, readers didn\'t read him.","For me, poetry is an evasion of the real job of writing prose.","Frustrated? Yes. Why? Because it is impossible for me to be God \u2014 or the universal woman-and-man \u2014 or anything much. I am what I feel and think and do. I want to express my being as fully\\n as I can because I somewhere picked up the idea that I could justify my being alive that way.","The one thing I was good at was winning scholarships and prizes, and that era was coming to an end.","What is so real as the cry of a child?","I can\'t deceive myself out of the bare stark realization that no matter how enthusiastic you are, no matter how sure that character is fate, nothing is real, past or future, when you are alone in your room with the clock ticking loudly into the false cheerful brilliance of the electric light. And if you have no past or future which, after all, is all that the present is made of, why then you may as well dispose of the empty shell of present and commit suicide.","In a rabbit-fear I may hurl myself under the wheels of the car because the lights terrify me, and under the dark blind death of wheels I will be safe. I am very tired, very banal, very confused. I do not know who I am tonight. I wanted to walk until I dropped and not complete the inevitable circle of coming home.","But when it came right down to it, the skin of my wrist looked so white and defenseless that I couldn\'t do it.","I am afraid of getting married. Spare me from cooking three meals a dayspare me from the relentless cage of routine and rote.","But they know. They all know. And what am I against so many\u2026?","As from a star I saw, coldly and soberly, the separateness of everything. I felt the wall of my skin; I am I. That stone is a stone. My beautiful fusion with the things of this world was over.","I have this demon who wants me to run away screaming if I am going to be flawed, fallible. It wants me to think I\'m so good I must be perfect. Or nothing. I am, on the contrary, something: a being who gets tired, has shyness to fight, has more trouble than most facing people easily.","The journey over the bridge had unnerved me. The river water passed me by like an untouched drink. I suspected that even if my mother and brother had not been there I would have made no move to jump.","A terrible depression yesterday. Visions of my life petering out into a kind of soft-brained stupor from lack of use.","I felt wise and cynical as all hell.","I must be lean & write & make worlds beside this to live in.","I\u2019d discovered, after a lot of extreme apprehension about what spoons to use, that if you do something incorrect at table with a certain arrogance, as if you knew perfectly well you were doing it properly, you can get away with it and nobody will think you are bad-mannered or poorly brought up. They will think you are original and very witty.","As a poet I would say everything should be able to come into a poem but I can\'t put toothbrushes in a poem. I really can\'t.","The artist\'s life nourishes itself on the particular, the concrete.","I love the people,\' I said. \'I have room in me for love, and for ever so many little lives.","And so I rehabilitate myself - staying up late this Friday night in spite of vowing to go to bed early, because it is more important to capture moments like this, keen shifts in mood, sudden veering of direction - than to lose it in slumber.","I had always imagined myself hitching up on to my elbows on the delivery table after it was all over - dead white, of course, with no makeup and from the awful ordeal, but smiling and radiant, with my hair down to my waist, and reaching out for my first little squirmy child and saying its name, whatever it was.","What do you have in mind after you graduate?\\" What I always thought I had in mind was getting some big scholarship to graduate school or a grant to study all over Europe, and then I thought I\'d be a professor and write books of poems or write books of poems and be an editor of some sort. Usually I had these plans on the tip of my tongue. \\"I don\'t really know,\\" I heard myself say. I felt a deep shock, hearing myself say that, because the minute I said it, I knew it was true.","I suppose if I gave myself the chance I could be an alcoholic.","Nothing stinks like a pile of unpublished writing, which remark I guess shows I still don\'t have a pure motive (O it\'s-such-fun-I-just-can\'t-stop-who-cares-if-it\'s-published-or-read) about writing.","From the night Buddy Willard kissed me and said I must go out with a lot of boys, he made me feel I was much more sexy and experienced than he was and that everything he did like hugging and kissing and petting was simply what I made him feel like doing out of the blue, he couldn\u2019t help it and didn\u2019t know how it came about. Now I saw he had only been pretending all this time to be so innocent.","I didn\'t know shorthand either. This meant I couldn\'t get a good job after college. My mother kept telling me nobody wanted a plain English major. But an English major who knew shorthand would be something else again. Everybody would want her. She would be in demand among all the up-and-coming young men and she would transcribe letter after thrilling letter. The trouble was, I hated the idea of serving men in any way. I wanted to dictate my own thrilling letters.","The blood jet is poetry and there is no stopping it.","Outcast on a cold star, unable to feel anything but an awful helpless numbness. I look down into the warm, earthy world. Into a nest of lovers\' beds, baby cribs, meal tables, all the solid commerce of life in this earth, and feel apart, enclosed in a wall of glass.","Life was not to be sitting in hot amorphic leisure in my backyard idly writing or not writing, as the spirit moved me. It was, instead, running madly, in a crowded schedule, in a squirrel cage of busy people. Working, living, dancing, dreaming, talking, kissing- singing, laughing, learning.","You are the one. Solid the spaces lean on, envious. You are the baby in the barn.","If you dissect a bird / to diagram the tongue, / you\'ll cut the chord / articulating song.","I knew chemistry would be worse, because I\'d seen a big card of the ninety-odd elements hung up in the chemistry lab, and all the perfectly good words like gold and silver and cobalt and aluminum were shortened to ugly abbreviations with different decimal numbers after them.","Why honey, don\'t you want to get dressed?\\" My mother took care never to tell me to do anything. She would only reason with me sweetly, like one intelligent, mature person with another. It\'s almost three in the afternoon.\\" I\'m writing a novel,\\" I said. \\"I haven\'t got time to change into this and change into that.","I began to see why woman-haters could make such fools of women. Woman-haters were like gods: invulnerable and chock full of power. They descended, and then they disappeared.

I\u2019ve tried to picture my world and the people in it as seen through the distorting lens of a bell jar.","This is the light of the mind, cold and planetary. The trees of the mind are black. The light is blue.","Piece by piece, I fed my wardrobe to the night wind, and flutteringly, like a loved one\u2019s ashes, the gray scraps were ferried off, to settle here, there, exactly where I would never know, in the dark heart of New York.","I do feel that now and I feel that this development of recording poems, of speaking poems at readings, of having records of poets, I think this is a wonderful thing. I\'m very excited by it. In a sense, there\'s a return, isn\'t there, to the old role of the poet, which was to speak to a group of people, to come across.","The moon has nothing to be sad about,\\nStaring from her hood of bone.\\nShe is used to this sort of thing.\\nHer blacks crackle and drag.","A little thing, like children putting flowers in my hair, can fill up the widening cracks in my self-assurance like soothing lanolin.","Poetry, I feel, is a tyrannical discipline, you\'ve got to go so far, so fast, in such a small space that you\'ve just got to turn away all the peripherals.","I feel that very strongly: having been an academic, having been tempted by the invitation to stay on to become a Ph.D., a professor, and all that, one side of me certainly does respect all disciplines, as long as they don\'t ossify.","I suppose I\'ll always be over-vulnerable, slightly paranoid.","I am terrified by this dark thing That sleeps in me; All day I feel its soft, feathery turnings, its malignity. Clouds pass and disperse. Are those the faces of love, those pale irretrievables? Is it for such I agitate my heart? I am incapable of more knowledge. What is this, this face So murderous in its strangle of branches? - Its snaky acids kiss. It petrifies the will. These are the isolate, slow faults That kill, that kill, that kill.","They would grow old. They would forget me.","Let me sit in a flowerpot, The spiders won\'t notice. My heart is a stopped geranium.","Some things are hard to write about. After something happens to you, you go to write it down, and either you over dramatize it, or underplay it, exaggerate the wrong parts or ignore the important ones.

It made me go all sleepy & peaceful.","I drink sherry and wine by myself because I like it and I get the sensuous feeling of indulgence...luxury, bliss, erotic-tinged.","I didn\'t know what I was doing in New York.","The only thing I could think of was turkey neck and turkey gizzards and I felt very depressed.","But life is long. And it is the long run that balances the short flare of interest and passion.","I do not know who I am tonight.","God, it was good to let go, let the tight mask fall off, and the bewildered, chaotic fragments pour out.

I talk to God, but the sky is empty, and Orion walks by and doesn\'t speak.","I hate Technicolor. Everybody in a Technicolor movie seems to feel obliged to wear a lurid costume in each new scene and to stand around like a clotheshorse with a lot of very green trees or very yellow wheat or very blue ocean rolling away for miles and miles in every direction.","Widow. The word consumes itself.","I started adding up all the things I couldn\'t do.","The silence drew off, baring the pebbles and shells and all the tatty wreckage of my life.","With me, the present is forever, and forever is always shifting, flowing, melting.

But I am not omniscient. I have to live my life, and it is the only one I\'ll ever have. And you cannot regard your own life with objective curiosity all the time...","I didn\'t know why I was going to cry, but I knew that if anybody spoke to me or looked at me too closely the tears would fly out of my eyes and the sobs would fly out of the throat and I\'d cry for a week.","I didn\u2019t want any flowers, I only wantedto lie with my hands turned up and be utterly empty.How free it is, you have no idea how free.","Yes, my consuming desire is to mingle with road crews, sailors and soldiers, barroom regulars\u2014to be a part of a scene, anonymous, listening, recording\u2014all this is spoiled by the fact that I am a girl, a female always supposedly in danger of assault and battery. My consuming interest in men and their lives is often misconstrued as a desire to seduce them, or as an invitation to intimacy. Yes, God, I want to talk to everybody as deeply as I can. I want to be able to sleep in an open field, to travel west, to walk freely at night...","I write only becauseThere is a voice within meThat will not be still","And the danger is that in this move toward new horizons and far directions, that I may lose what I have now, and not find anything except loneliness.","Out of the ash I rise with my red hairand I eat men like air.","Death must be so beautiful. To lie in the soft brown earth, with the grasses waving above one\u2019s head, and listen to silence. To have no yesterday, and no tomorrow. To forget time, to forgive life, to be at peace.","I told him I believed in hell, and that certain people, like me, had to live in hell before they died, to make up for missing out on it after death, since they didn\'t believe in life after death, and what each person believed happened to him when he died.","I feel good with my husband: I like his warmth and his bigness and his being-there and his making and his jokes and stories and what he reads and how he likes fishing and walks and pigs and foxes and little animals and is honest and not vain or fame-crazy and how he shows his gladness for what I cook him and joy for when I make him something, a poem or a cake, and how he is troubled when I am unhappy and wants to do anything so I can fight out my soul-battles and grow up with courage and a philosophical ease. I love his good smell and his body that fits with mine as if they were made in the same body-shop to do just that. What is only pieces, doled out here and there to this boy and that boy, that made me like pieces of them, is all jammed together in my husband. So I don\'t want to look around any more: I don\'t need to look around for anything.","Eternity bores me,I never wanted it.From the poem \\"Years\\", 16 November 1962","Let\'s face it: I\'m scared, scared and frozen. First, I guess I\'m afraid for myself... the old primitive urge for survival. It\'s getting so I live every moment with terrible intensity.

So are the people you think you\'re curing. They\'re dust as dust as dust. I reckon a good poem lasts a whole lot longer than a hundred of those people put together.\'And of course Buddy wouldn\'t have any answer to that, because what I said was true. People were made of nothing so much as dust, and I couldn\'t see that doctoring all that dust was a bit better than writing poems people would remember and repeat to themselves when they were unhappy or sick or couldn\'t sleep.","I am terrified by this dark thingThat sleeps in me;All day I feel its soft, feathery turnings, its malignity.","I know pretty much what I like and dislike; but please, don\'t ask me who I am.","My world falls apart, crumbles, \u201cThe centre cannot hold. There is no integrating force, only the naked fear, the urge of self-preservation. I am afraid. I am not solid, but hollow. I feel behind my eyes a numb, paralysed cavern, a pit of hell, a mimicking nothingness. I never thought. I never wrote, I never suffered. I want to kill myself, to escape from responsibility, to crawl back abjectly into the womb. I do not know who I am, where I am going\u2014and I am the one who has to decide the answers to these hideous questions. I long for a noble escape from freedom\u2014I am weak, tired, in revolt from the strong constructive humanitarian faith which presupposes a healthy, active intellect and will.

I made them propose and then showed them they hadn\u2019t a chance. I hated men because they didn\u2019t have to suffer like a woman did. They could die or go to Spain. They could have fun while a woman had birth pangs. They could gamble while a woman skimped on the butter on the bread. Men, nasty lousy men.","At twenty I tried to dieAnd get back, back, back to you.I thought even the bones would do.","I have suffered the atrocity of sunsets.--from \\"Elm","I laugh, and my lipstick leaves a red stain like a bloody crescent moon on the top of the beer can.","I can\'t deceive myself that out of the bare stark realization that no matter how enthusiastic you are, no matter how sure that character is fate, nothing is real, past or future, when you are alone in your room with the clock ticking loudly into the false cheerful brilliance of the electric light. And if you have no past or future which, after all, is all that the present is made of, why then you may as well dispose of the empty shell of present and commit suicide.","So, now I shall talk every night. To myself. To the moon. I shall walk, as I did tonight, jealous of my loneliness, in the blue-silver of the cold moon, shining brilliantly on the drifts of fresh-fallen snow, with the myriad sparkles. I talk to myself and look at the dark trees, blessedly neutral. So much easier than facing people, than having to look happy, invulnerable, clever. With masks down, I walk, talking to the moon, to the neutral impersonal force that does not hear, but merely accepts my being. And does not smite me down.","Being born a woman is my awful tragedy. From the moment I was conceived I was doomed to sprout breasts and ovaries rather than penis and scrotum; to have my whole circle of action, thought and feeling rigidly circumscribed by my inescapable feminity. Yes, my consuming desire to mingle with road crews, sailors and soldiers, bar room regulars--to be a part of a scene, anonymous, listening, recording--all is spoiled by the fact that I am a girl, a female always in danger of assault and battery. My consuming interest in men and their lives is often misconstrued as a desire to seduce them, or as an invitation to intimacy. Yet, God, I want to talk to everybody I can as deeply as I can. I want to be able to sleep in an open field, to travel west, to walk freely at night...","I am afraid of getting older. I am afraid of getting married.

But, oh, I cry out against it. I am I\u2014I am powerful\u2014but to what extent? I am I.","I may never be happy, but tonight I am content. Nothing more than an empty house, the warm hazy weariness from a day spent setting strawberry runners in the sun, a glass of cool sweet milk, and a shallow dish of blueberries bathed in cream. When one is so tired at the end of a day one must sleep, and at the next dawn there are more strawberry runners to set, and so one goes on living, near the earth. At times like this I\'d call myself a fool to ask for more...","I have stitched life into me like a rare organ--from \\"Three Women: A Poem for Three Voices\\", written 1962","Backward we traveled to reclaim the dayBefore we fell, like Icarus, undone;All we find are altars in decayAnd profane words scrawled black across the sun.--From the poem \\"Doom of the Exiles\\", written 16 April 1954","Mother of otherness, Eat me.--from \\"Poem for a Birthday - Who\\", written 1960","No day is safe from news of you.--from \\"The Rival\\", written July 1961","I saw myself sitting in the crotch of this fig tree, starving to death, just because I couldn\'t make up my mind which of the figs I would choose.

I have no preconceptions.Whatever I see I swallow immediatelyJust as it is, unmisted by love or dislike.I am not cruel, only truthful-The eye of the little god, four cornered.Most of the time I meditate on the opposite wall. It is pink, with speckles. I have looked at it so longI think it is a part of my heart. But it flickers.Faces and darkness separate us over and over.Now I am a lake. A woman bends over me,Searching my reaches for what she really is.Then she turns to those liars, the candles or the moon.I see her back, and reflect it faithfully.She rewards me with tears and an agitation of hands.I am important to her. She comes and goes.Each morning it is her face that replaces the darkness.In me she has drowned a young girl, and in me an old womanRises toward her day after day, like a terrible fish.--written 1960","DADDYYou do not do, you do not doAny more, black shoeIn which I have lived like a footFor thirty years, poor and white,Barely daring to breathe or Achoo.

It\'s too risky. First of all, it\'s a hell of a responsibility to be yourself.

So I began to think maybe it was true that when you were married and had children it was like being brainwashed, and afterward you went about numb as a slave in some private, totalitarian state.","We\'ll act as if all this were a bad dream.\\"A bad dream.To the person in the bell jar, blank and stopped as a dead baby, the world itself is the bad dream.A bad dream.I remembered everything.I remembered the cadavers and Doreen and the story of the fig tree and Marco\'s diamond and the sailor on the Common and Doctor Gordon\'s wall-eyed nurse and the broken thermometers and the Negro with his two kinds of beans and the twenty pounds I gained on insulin and the rock that bulged between sky and sea like a gray skull.Maybe forgetfulness, like a kind snow, would numb and cover them.But they were part of me. They were my landscape.","That afternoon my mother had brought me the roses.\\"Save them for my funeral,\\" I\'d said.","There are times when a feeling of expectancy comes to me, as if something is there, beneath the surface of my understanding, waiting for me to grasp it. It is the same tantalizing sensation when you almost remember a name, but don\'t quite reach it. I can feel it when I think of human beings, of the hints of evolution suggested by the removal of wisdom teeth, the narrowing of the jaw no longer needed to chew such roughage as it was accustomed to; the gradual disappearance of hair from the human body; the adjustment of the human eye to the fine print, the swift, colored motion of the twentieth century. The feeling comes, vague and nebulous, when I consider the prolonged adolesence of our species; the rites of birth, marriage and death; all the primitive, barbaric ceremonies streamlined to modern times. Almost, I think, the unreasoning, bestial purity was best. Oh, something is there, waiting for me. Perhaps someday the revelation will burst in upon me and I will see the other side of this monumental grotesque joke. And then I\'ll laugh. And then I\'ll know what life is.","You smile.No, it is not fatal.--from \\"The Other\\", written 1962","There must be quite a few things a hot bath won\'t cure, but I don\'t know many of them.

There are those who will live, unconscious of me, but continuing my attitude, so to speak, as I continue, unknowingly, the similar attitude of those before me. I could write and write. All it takes is a motion of the hand in response to a brain impulse, trained from childhood to record in our own American brand of hieroglyphics the translations of external stimuli. How much of my brain is wilfully my own? How much is not a rubber stamp of what I have read and heard and lived? Sure, I make a sort of synthesis of what I come across, but that is all that differentiates me from another person? - - - That I have banged into and assimilated various things? That my environment and a chance combination of genes got me where I am?","And I am aware of my heart: it opens and closesIts bowl of red blooms out of sheer love of me.--from \\"Tulips\\", written 18 March 1961","I lay and cried, and began to feel again, to admit I was human, vulnerable, sensitive. I began to remember how it had been before; how there was that germ of positive creativeness. Character is fate; and damn, I\'d better work on my character. I had been withdrawing into a retreat of numbness: it is so much safer not to feel, not to let the world touch one. But my honest self revolted at this, hated me for doing this. Sick with conflict, destructive negative emotions, frozen into disintegration I was, refusing to articulate, to spew forth these emotions - they festered in me, growing big, distorted, like pus-bloated sores. Small problems, mentions of someone else\'s felicity, evidence of someone else\'s talents, frightened me, making me react hollowly, fighting jealousy, envy, hate. Feeling myself fall apart, decay, rot, and the laurels wither and fall away, and my past sins and omissions strike me with full punishment and import. All this, all this foul, gangrenous, sludge ate away at my insides. Silent, insidious.","It was comforting to know I had fallen and could fall no farther.","\u2026What is my life for and what am I going to do with it? I don\'t know and I\u2019m afraid. I can never read all the books I want; I can never be all the people I want and live all the lives I want. I can never train myself in all the skills I want. And what do I want? I want to live and feel all the shades, tones, and variations of mental and physical experience possible in my life. And I am horribly limited.

When I was small, days and hours were long and spacious, and there was play and acres of leisure, and many children\'s books to read. I remember that as I was writing a poem on \\"Snow\\" when I was eight. I said aloud, \\"I wish I could have the ability to write down the feelings I have now while I\'m still little, because when I grow up I will know how to write, but I will have forgotten what being little feels like.\\" And so it is that childlike sensitivity to new experiences and sensations seems to diminish in an inverse proportion to growth of technical ability. As we become polished, so do we become hardened and guilty of accepting eating, sleeping, seeing, and hearing too easily and lazily, without question. We become blunt and callous and blissfully passive as each day adds another drop to the stagnant well of our years.","Every woman adores a Fascist,The boot in the face, the bruteBrute heart of a brute like you.","Is it the sea you hear in me,Its dissatisfactions?Or the voice of nothing, that was you madness?--from \\"Elm\\", written 19 April 1962","I am still raw.I say I may be back.You know what lies are for.Even in your Zen heaven we shan\'t meet.--from \\"Lesbos\\", written 18 October 1962","I dreamed that you bewitched me into bedAnd sung me moon-struck, kissed me quite insane.(I think I made you up inside my head.)--from \\"Mad Girl\'s Love Song: A Villanelle\\", written 1954","Life was not to be sitting in hot amorphic leisure in my backyard idly writing or not-writing, as the spirit moved me.

I blamed her for everything, but she didn\'t answer.\\u2028I couldn\'t understand her stupid behavior!\\u2028When I hit her she held still, like a true pacifist.\\u2028Then I realized what she wanted was for me to love her:She began to warm up, and I saw her advantages.\\u2028\\u2028Without me, she wouldn\'t exist, so of course she was grateful.\\u2028I gave her a soul, I bloomed out of her as a rose\\u2028Blooms out of a vase of not very valuable porcelain, And it was I who attracted everybody\'s attention,\\u2028Not her whiteness and beauty, as I had at first supposed.\\u2028I patronized her a little, and she lapped it up --\\u2028You could tell almost at once she had a slave mentality.\\u2028\\u2028I didn\'t mind her waiting on me, and she adored it.\\u2028In the morning she woke me early, reflecting the sun\\u2028From her amazingly white torso, and I couldn\'t help but notice\\u2028Her tidiness and her calmness and her patience: She humored my weakness like the best of nurses,\\u2028Holding my bones in place so they would mend properly.In time our relationship grew more intense.\\u2028\\u2028She stopped fitting me so closely and seemed offish.\\u2028I felt her criticizing me in spite of herself,\\u2028As if my habits offended her in some way. She let in the drafts and became more and more absent-minded.\\u2028And my skin itched and flaked away in soft pieces\\u2028Simply because she looked after me so badly. Then I saw what the trouble was: she thought she was immortal.She wanted to leave me, she thought she was superior,\\u2028And I\'d been keeping her in the dark, and she was resentful -- Wasting her days waiting on a half-corpse!\\u2028And secretly she began to hope I\'d die.Then she could cover my mouth and eyes, cover me entirely,\\u2028And wear my painted face the way a mummy-case Wears the face of a pharaoh, though it\'s made of mud and water.\\u2028\\u2028I wasn\'t in any position to get rid of her. She\'d supported me for so long I was quite limp -- I had forgotten how to walk or sit, So I was careful not to upset her in any way\\u2028Or brag ahead of time how I\'d avenge myself. Living with her was like living with my own coffin: Yet I still depended on her, though I did it regretfully. I used to think we might make a go of it together --\\u2028After all, it was a kind of marriage, being so close.\\u2028Now I see it must be one or the other of us. She may be a saint, and I may be ugly and hairy,\\u2028But she\'ll soon find out that that doesn\'t matter a bit. I\'m collecting my strength; one day I shall manage without her,\\u2028And she\'ll perish with emptiness then, and begin to miss me.--written 26 Feburary 1961","we shall board our imagined ship and wildly sail among sacred islands of the mad till death shatters the fabulous stars and makes us real.--from \\"Tale of A Tub\\", written 1956","I didn\'t know shorthand either.This meant I couldn\'t get a good job after college. My mother kept telling me nobody wanted a plain English major. But an English major who knew shorthand would be something else again. Everybody would want her. She would be in demand among all the up-and-coming young men and she would transcribe letter after thrilling letter.The trouble was, I hated the idea of serving men in any way. I wanted to dictate my own thrilling letters.","It was a queer, sultry summer, the summer they executed the Rosenbergs, and I didn\'t know what I was doing in New York. I\'m stupid about executions. The idea of being electrocuted makes me sick, and that\'s all there was to read about in the papers -- goggle-eyed headlines staring up at me at every street corner and at the fusty, peanut-smelling mouth of every subway. It had nothing to do with me, but I couldn\'t help wondering what it would be like, being burned alive all along your nerves.I thought it must be the worst thing in the world.New York was bad enough. By nine in the morning the fake, country-wet freshness that somehow seeped in overnight evaporated like the tail end of a sweet dream. Mirage-gray at the bottom of their granite canyons, the hot streets wavered in the sun, the car tops sizzled and glittered, and the dry, cindery dust blew into my eyes and down my throat.","What do you have in mind after you graduate?\\"What I always thought I had in mind was getting some big scholarship to graduate school or a grant to study all over Europe, and then I thought I\'d be a professor and write books of poems or write books of poems and be an editor of some sort. Usually I had these plans on the tip of my tongue.\\"I don\'t really know,\\" I heard myself say. I felt a deep shock, hearing myself say that, because the minute I said it, I knew it was true.","There is no living being on earth at this moment except myself. I could walk down the halls, and empty rooms would yawn mockingly at me from every side. God, but life is loneliness, despite all the opiates, despite the shrill tinsel gaiety of \'parties\' with no purpose, despite the false grinning faces we all wear. And when at last you find someone to whom you feel you can pour out your soul, you stop in shock at the words you utter \u2014 they are so rusty, so ugly, so meaningless and feeble from being kept in the small cramped dark inside you so long. Yes, there is joy, fulfillment and companionship \u2014 but the loneliness of the soul in it\'s appalling self-consciousness, is horrible and overpowering.","I know the bottom, she says.

Beyond a wholesome discipline, be gentle with yourself. You are a child of the universe no less than the trees and the stars; you have a right to be here.","Strange, when one thinks of all the other boys, infinite experimental kisses, test tube infatuations, crushes, pseudo-loves.All through this physical separation, through the testing and the trying of the others, there has been this peculiar rapport, comradeship, of us two so alike, so similar, but for science-boy and humanities-girl - the introspection, self examination, biannual deep summarizing conversations, and then the platonic parting.","God, who am I?","His lyrical whistle beckoned me to adventure and forgetting. But I didn\'t want to forget. Hugging my grudge, ugly and prickly, a sad sea urchin, I trudged off on my own, in the opposite direction toward the forbidding prison. As from a star I saw, coldly and soberly, the separateness of everything. I felt the wall of my skin; I am I. That stone is a stone. My beautiful fusion with the things of this world was over.The Tide ebbed, sucked back into itself. There I was, a reject, with the dried black seaweed whose hard beads I liked to pop, hollowed orange and grapefruit halves and a garbage of shells. All at once, old and lonely, I eyed these-- razor clams, fairy boats, weedy mussels, the oyster\'s pocked gray lace (there was never a pearl) and tiny white \\"ice cream cones.\\" You could always tell where the best shells were-- at the rim of the last wave, marked by a mascara of tar. I picked up, frigidly, a stiff pink starfish. It lay at the heart of my palm, a joke dummy of my own hand. Sometimes I nursed starfish alive in jam jars of seawater and watched them grow back lost arms. On this day, this awful birthday of otherness, my rival, somebody else, I flung the starfish against a stone. Let it perish.","When they asked some old Roman philosopher or other how he wanted to die, he said he would open his veins in a warm bath. I thought it would be easy, lying in the tub and seeing the redness flower from my wrists, flush after flush through the clear water, till I sank to sleep under a surface gaudy of poppies.But when it came right down to it, the sink of my wrist looked so white and defenseless that I couldn\'t do it. It was as if what I wanted to kill wasn\'t in that skin or the thin blue pulse that jumped under my thumb, but somewhere else, deeper, more secret, and a whole lot harder to get at.","I am I am I am.","Then it hit me and I just blurted, \'I like people too much or not at all. I\'ve got to go down deep, to fall into people, to really know them.","What is my life for and what am I going to do with it? I don\'t know and I\'m afraid. I can never read all the books I want; I can never be all the people I want and live all the lives I want. I can never train myself in all the skills I want. And why do I want? I want to live and feel all the shades, tones, and variations of mental and physical experience possible in my life. And I am horribly limited. Yet I am not a cretin: lame, blind and stupid. I am not a veteran, passing my legless, armless days in a wheelchair. I am not that mongoloidish old man shuffling out of the gates of the mental hospital. I have much to live for, yet unaccountably I am sick and sad. Perhaps you could trace my feeling back to my distaste at having to choose between alternatives. Perhaps that\'s why I want to be everyone - so no one can blame me for being I. So I won\'t have to take the responsibility for my own character development and philosophy. People are happy - - - if that means being content with your lot: feeling comfortable as the complacent round peg struggling in a round hole, with no awkward or painful edges - no space to wonder or question in. I am not content, because my lot is limiting, as are all others. People specialize; people become devoted to an idea; people \\"find themselves.\\" But the very content that comes from finding yourself is overshadowed by the knowledge that by doing so you are admitting you are not only a grotesque, but a special kind of grotesque.","I am afraid. I am not solid, but hollow. I feel behind my eyes a numb, paralyzed cavern, a pit of hell, a mimicking nothingness. I never thought, I never wrote, I never suffered. I want to kill myself, to escape from responsibility, to crawl back abjectly into the womb. I do not know who I am, where I am going - and I am the one who has to decide the answers to these hideous questions.","I don\'t know how long I kept at it...I felt reasonably safe, streched out on the floor, and lay quite still.It didn\'t seem to be summer any more","\u06af\u0627\u0647\u06cc \u0627\u0648\u0642\u0627\u062a \u0645\u062c\u0628\u0648\u0631\u06cc\u0645 \u0628\u067e\u0630\u06cc\u0631\u06cc\u0645 \u06a9\u0647 \u0628\u0639\u0636\u06cc \u0627\u0632 \u0622\u062f\u0645 \u0647\u0627 \u0641\u0642\u0637 \u0645\u06cc \u062a\u0648\u0627\u0646\u0646\u062f \u062f\u0631 \u0642\u0644\u0628\u0645\u0627\u0646 \u0628\u0645\u0627\u0646\u0646\u062f \u0646\u0647 \u062f\u0631 \u0632\u0646\u062f\u06af\u06cc\u0645\u0627\u0646","I wait and ache.","God, let me think clearly and brightly; let me live, love, and say it well in good sentences, let me someday see who I am.","Ready for a new life","I told Doreen I would not go to the show or the luncheon or the film premiere, but that I would not go to Coney Island either, I would stay in bed.

I am feeling depressed from being exposed to so many lives, so many of them exciting, new to my realm of experience. I pass by people, grazing them on the edges, and it bothers me. I\'ve got to admire someone to really like them deeply - to value them as friends. It was that way with Ann: I admired her wit, her riding, her vivacious imagination - all the things that made her the way she was. I could lean on her as she leaned on me. Together the two of us could face anything - only not quite anything, or she would be back. And so she is gone, and I am bereft for awhile.

Only for me, the long perspective of shades that set off one box from the next had suddenly snapped up, and I could see day after day after day glaring ahead of me like a white, broad, infinitely desolate avenue.It seemed silly to wash one day when I would only have to wash again the next.It made me tired just to think of it.I wanted to do everything once and for all and be through with it.","I could feel the tears brimming and sloshing in me like water in a glass that is unsteady and too full.","My mother smiled. \\"I know my baby wasn\'t like that.\\"I looked at her. \\"Like what?\\"\\"Like those awful people.

Should I sublimate (my how we throw words around!) my selfishness in serving other people- through social or other such work? Would I then become more sensitive to other people and their problems?

I was sitting out on the steps today, uneasy with fear and discontent. Peter, (the little boy-across-the-street) with the pointed pale face, the grave blue eyes and the slow fragile smile came bringing his adorable sister Libby of the flaxen braids and the firm, lyrically-formed child-body. They stood shyly for a little, and then Peter picked a white petunia and put it in my hair. Thus began an enchanting game, where I sat very still, while Libby ran to and fro gathering petunias, and Peter stood by my side, arranging the blossoms. I closed my eyes to feel more keenly the lovely delicate-child-hands, gently tucking flower after flower into my curls. \\"And now a white one,\\" the lisp was soft and tender. Pink, crimson, scarlet, white ... the faint pungent odor of the petunias was hushed and sweet. And all my hurts were smoothed away.

So are the people you think you\u2019re curing. They\u2019re dust as dust as dust. I reckon a good poem lasts a whole lot longer than a hundred of those people put together.\u2019 And of course Buddy wouldn\u2019t have any answer to that, because what I said was true.

How can I justify, how can I rationalize the rest of my life away?","I am your opus.","I shut my eyes and all the world drops dead;I lift my lids and all is born again.[I think I made you up inside my head.]","This is the light of the mind, cold and planetary.","The more hopeless you were, the farther away they hid you.","The trouble was, I hated the idea of serving men in any way.","Do you realize the illicit sensuous delight I get from picking my nose? I always have, ever since I was a child. There are so many subtle variations of sensation. A delicate, pointed-nailed fifth finger can catch under dry scabs and flakes of mucous in the nostril and draw them out to be looked at, crumbled between fingers, and flicked to the floor in minute crusts. Or a heavier, determined forefinger can reach up and smear down-and-out the soft, resilient, elastic greenish-yellow smallish blobs of mucous, roll them round and jellylike between thumb and forefinger, and spread them on the undersurface of a desk or chair where they will harden into organic crusts. How many desks and chairs have I thus secretively befouled since childhood? Or sometimes there will be blood mingled with the mucous: in dry brown scabs, or bright sudden wet red on the finger that scraped too rudely the nasal membranes. God, what sexual satisfaction!","I felt now that all the uncomfortable suspicions I had about myself were coming true, and I couldn\'t hide the truth much longer. After nineteen years of running after good marks and prizes and grants of one sort and another, I was letting up, slowing down, dropping clean out of the race.","Let me fly with you.","Hard, sharp, ticks. I hate them. Measuring thought, infinite space, by cogs and wheels. Can you understand? Someone, somewhere, can you understand me a little, love me a little?

I don\'t know and I\'m afraid. I can never read all the books I want; I can never be all the people I want and live all the lives I want. I can never train myself in all the skills I want. And why do I want? I want to live and feel all the shades, tones, and variations of mental and physical experience possible in my life. And I am horribly limited. Yet I am not a cretin: lame, blind and stupid. I am not a veteran, passing my legless, armless days in a wheelchair. I am not that mongoloidish old man shuffling out of the gates of the mental hospital. I have much to live for, yet unaccountably I am sick and sad. Perhaps you could trace my feeling back to my distaste at having to choose between alternatives. Perhaps that\'s why I want to be everyone - so no one can blame me for being I. So I won\'t have to take the responsibility for my own character development and philosophy. People are happy - - - if that means being content with your lot: feeling comfortable as the complacent round peg struggling in a round hole, with no awkward or painful edges - no space to wonder or question in. I am not content, because my lot is limiting, as are all others.

Then you can safely choose to enrich your life by marrying another person, and not, as e e cummings says, until.","I never feel so much myself as when I\'m in a hot bath.I lay in that tub on the seventeenth floor of this hotel for-women-only, high up over the jazz and push of New York, for near onto an hour, and I felt myself growing pure again. I don\'t believe in baptism or the waters of Jordan or anything like that, but I guess I feel about a hot bath the way those religious people feel about holy water.","I felt sorry when I came to the last page. I wanted to crawl in between those black lines of print the way you crawl through a fence.","I need a father. I need a mother. I need some older, wiser being to cry to.

I slept, say: a snakeMasked among black rocks as a black rockIn the white hiatus of winter-Like my neighbors, taking no pleasureIn the million perfectly-chisledCheeks alighting each moment to meltMy cheeks of basalt. They turned to tears,Angels weeping over dull natures,But didn\'t convince me. Those tears froze.Each dead head had a visor of ice.And I slept on like a bent finger.The first thing I was was sheer airAnd the locked drops rising in dewLimpid as spirits. Many stones layDense and expressionless round about.I didn\'t know what to make of it.I shone, mice-scaled, and unfoldedTo pour myself out like a fluidAmong bird feet and the stems of plants.I wasn\'t fooled. I knew you at once.Tree and stone glittered, without shadows.My finger-length grew lucent as glass.I started to bud like a March twig:An arm and a leg, and arm, a leg.From stone to cloud, so I ascended.Now I resemble a sort of godFloating through the air in my soul-shiftPure as a pane of ice. It\'s a gift.","I am in danger of wanting my personal absolute to be a demigod of a man, and as there aren\'t many around, I often unconsciously manufacture my own. and then, I retreat and revel in poetry and literature where the reward value is tangible and accepted. I really do not think deeply. really deeply. I want a romantic nonexistant hero.","And of course I didn\'t know who would marry me now that I\'d been where I had been. I didn\'t know at all.","But the life of a Willa Cather, a Lillian Helman, and Virginia Woolf - - - would it not be a series of rapid ascents and probing descents into shades and meanings \u2014 into more people, ideas and conceptions?

Clouds are floweringBlue and mystical over the face of the stars. Inside the church, the saints will be all blue,Floating on their delicate feet over the cold pews, Their hands and faces stiff with holiness. The moon sees nothing of this. She is bald and wild. And the message of the yew tree is blackness -- blackness and silence.","From now on when a boy starts telling me about his lost loves I am going to run in the opposite direction screaming loudly... Somehow I bring out such confidences, and I\'m pretty sick of hearing about Bobbe or Dorothy or P.K. or Liota. God damn them all.","I have this demon who wants me to run away screaming if I am going to be flawed, fallible. It wants me to think I\u2019m so good I must be perfect. Or nothing. I am, on the contrary, something: a being who gets tired, has shyness to fight, has more trouble than most facing people easily. If I get through this year, kicking my demon down when it comes up, I\u2019ll be able, piece by piece, to face the field of life, instead of running from it the minute it hurts.","Doreen is dissolving, Lenny Shepherd is dissolving, Frankie is dissolving, New York is dissolving, they are all dissolving away and none of them matter anymore.I don\'t know them. I have never known them and I am very pure.","I knew something was wrong with me that summer, because all I could think about was the Rosenbergs and how stupid I\'d been to buy all those uncomfortable, expensive clothes, hanging limp as fish in my closet, and how all the little successes I\'d totted up so happily at college fizzled to nothing outside the slick marble and plate-glass fronts along Madison Avenue.","A psychiatrist is the God of our age. But they cost money.","The reason I hadn\'t washed my clothes or my hair was because it seemed so silly. I saw the day of the year stretching ahead like a series of bright, white boxes, and separating one box from another was sleep, like a black shade. Only for me, the long perspective of shades that set off one box from the next had suddenly snapped up, and I could see day after day glaring ahead of me like a white, broad, infinitely desolate avenue. It seemed silly to wash one day when I would only have to wash again the next. It made me tired just to think of it. I wanted to do everything once and for all and be done with it.","God, I scream for time to let go, to write, to think. But no. I have to exercise my memory in little feats just so I can stay in this damn wonderful place which I love and hate with all my heart. And so the snow slows and swirls, and melts along the edges. The first snow isn\'t good for much. It makes a few people write poetry, a few wonder if the Christmas shopping is done, a few make reservations at the skiing lodge. It\'s a sentimental prelude to the real thing. It\'s picturesque & quaint.","I\'m collecting my strength; one day I shall manage without her, and she\'ll perish with emptiness then, and begin to miss me","I do not want much of a present, anyway, this year. After all I am alive only by accident.","What I fear most, I think, is the death of the imagination.... If I sit still and don\'t do anything, the world goes on beating like a slack drum, without meaning. We must be moving, working, making dreams to run toward; the poverty of life without dreams is too horrible to imagine.","And I, stepping from this skinOf old bandages, boredoms, old facesStep to you from the black car of Lethe,Pure as a baby.","The claw / Of the magnolia, / Drunk on its own secrets, / Asks nothing of life.","There is history to read- centuries to comprehend before I sleep, millions of lives to assimilate before breakfast tomorrow.","All my life I\'d told myself studying and reading and writing and working like mad was what I wanted to do, and it actually seemed to be true, I did everything well enough and got all A\'s, and by the time I made it to college nobody could stop me.","I fixed my eyes on the largest cloud, as if when it passed out of sight, I might have the good luck to pass with it.","I think I\u2019m in love with missing you more than I\u2019m in love with you.","But I grow old and I forget your name. (I think I made you up inside my head.)","Stasis in darkness.Then the substanceless blue","From the tip of every branch, like a fat purple fig, a wonderful future beckoned and winked. One fig was a husband and a happy home and children, and another fig was a famous poet and another fig was a brilliant professor, [...] and another fig was Europe and Africa and South America, and another fig was Constantin and Socrates and Attilla and a pack of other lovers with queer names [...] I saw myself sitting in the crotch of this fig tree, starving to death, just because I couldn\'t make up my mind which of the figs I would choose. I wanted each and every one of them, but choosing one meant losing all the rest...","A living doll, everywhere you look. It can sew, it can cook, It can talk, talk, talk. \xa0 It works, there is nothing wrong with it. You have a hole, its a poultice. You have an eye, its an image. My boy, its your last resort. Will you marry it, marry it, marry it.","And when at last you find someone to whom you feel you can pour out your soul, you stop in shock at the words you utter.","My mother smiled. \\"I knew my baby wasn\'t like that.\\"I looked at her. \\"Like what?\\"\\"Like those awful people. Those awful dead people at that hospital.\\" She paused. \\"I knew you\'d decide to be all right again.","O myHomunculus, I am ill.I have taken a pill to killThe thinPapery feeling.From the poem \\"Cut\\", 24 October 1962","I saw their mouths going up and down without a sound, as if they were sitting on the deck of a departing ship, stranding me in the middle of a huge silence.","Something in me wants more. I can\u2019t rest.","I\'m not sure why it is, but I love food more than just about anything else.","A second wave collapsed over my feet, lipped with white froth, and the chill gripped my ankles with a mortal ache.","Well, I tried drowning, but that didn\'t work; somehow the urge to life, mere physical life, is damn strong, and I felt that I could swim forever straight out into the sea and sun and never be able to swallow more than a gulp or two of water and swim on. The body is amazingly stubborn when it comes to sacrificing itself to the annihilating directions of the mind.","Already she feels jaded. Weary, and gladly tired and old.","There is a chargeFor the eyeing of my scars, there is a charge For the hearing of my heart\u2014\u2014It really goes.","The trouble was, I hated the idea of serving men in any way. I wanted to dictate my own thrilling letters.","daddy daddy you bastard, i\'m through","I tried to imagine what it would be like if Constantin were my husband.It would mean getting up at seven and cooking him eggs and bacon and toast andcoffee and dawdling about in my nightgown and curlers after he\'d left for work to wash up the dirty plates and make the bed, and then when he came home after a lively, fascinating day he\'d expect a big dinner, and I\'d spend the evening washing up even more dirty plates till I fell into bed, utterly exhausted. This seemed a dreary and wasted life for a girl with fifteen years of straight A\'s, but I knew that\'s what marriage was like, because cook and clean and wash was just what Buddy Willard\'s mother did from morning till night, and she was the wife of a university professor and had been a private school teacher herself.","I want to live and feel all the shades, tones, and variations of mental and physical experience possible in my life. And I am horribly limited.","Life has been a combination of fairy-tale coincidence and joie de vivre and shocks of beauty together with some hurtful self-questioning.","I\'ve been wondering. . . I mean, I thought you might be able to tell me something.\\" Buddy met my eyes and I saw, for the first time, how he had changed. Instead of the old, sure smile that flashed on easily and frequently as a photographer\'s bulb, his face was grave, even tentative -- the face of a man who often does not get what he wants.","We are not what we might be; what we are / Outlaws all extrapolation / Beyond the interval of now and here: / White whales are gone with the white ocean.","I have often fought, fought & won, not perfection, but an acceptance of myself as having a right to live on my own human, fallible terms.","Now I\'ll never see him again, and maybe it\'s a good thing. He walked out of my life last night for once and for all. I know with sickening certainty that it\'s the end. There were just those two dates we had, and the time he came over with the boys, and tonight. Yet I liked him too much - - - way too much, and I ripped him out of my heart so it wouldn\'t get to hurt me more than it did. Oh, he\'s magnetic, he\'s charming; you could fall into his eyes. Let\'s face it: his sex appeal was unbearably strong. I wanted to know him - - - the thoughts, the ideas behind the handsome, confident, wise-cracking mask. \\"I\'ve changed,\\" he told me. \\"You would have liked me three years ago. Now I\'m a wiseguy.\\" We sat together for a few hours on the porch, talking, and staring at nothing. Then the friction increased, centered. His nearness was electric in itself. \\"Can\'t you see,\\" he said. \\"I want to kiss you.\\" So he kissed me, hungrily, his eyes shut, his hand warm, curved burning into my stomach. \\"I wish I hated you,\\" I said. \\"Why did you come?\\" \\"Why? I wanted your company. Alby and Pete were going to the ball game, and I couldn\'t see that. Warrie and Jerry were going drinking; couldn\'t see that either.\\" It was past eleven; I walked to the door with him and stepped outside into the cool August night. \\"Come here,\\" he said. \\"I\'ll whisper something: I like you, but not too much. I don\'t want to like anybody too much.\\" Then it hit me and I just blurted, \\"I like people too much or not at all. I\'ve got to go down deep, to fall into people, to really know them.\\" He was definite, \\"Nobody knows me.\\" So that was it; the end. \\"Goodbye for good, then,\\" I said. He looked hard at me, a smile twisting his mouth, \\"You lucky kid; you don\'t know how lucky you are.\\" I was crying quietly, my face contorted. \\"Stop it!\\" The words came like knife thrusts, and then gentleness, \\"In case I don\'t see you, have a nice time at Smith.\\" \\"Have a hell of a nice life,\\" I said. And he walked off down the path with his jaunty, independent stride. And I stood there where he left me, tremulous with love and longing, weeping in the dark. That night it was hard to get to sleep.","I\'m so jealous I can\'t speak.","Sometimes I wondered if I had made Joan up. Other times I wondered if she would continue to pop in at every crisis of my life to remind me of what I had been, and what I had been through, and carry on her own separate but similar crisis under my nose.","Once when I visited Buddy I found Mrs. Willard braiding a rug out of strips of wool from Mr. Willard\u2019s old suits. She\u2019d spent weeks on that rug, and I had admired the tweedy browns and greens and blues patterning the braid, but after Mrs. Willard was through, instead of hanging the rug on the wall the way I would have done, she put it down in place of her kitchen mat, and in a few days it was soiled and dull and indistinguishable from any mat you could buy for under a dollar in the five and ten.\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0 And I knew that in spite of all the roses and kisses and restaurant dinners a man showered on a woman before he married her, what he secretly wanted when the wedding service ended was for her to flatten out underneath his feet like Mrs. Willard\u2019s kitchen mat.","brave love, dreamnot of staunching such strict flame, but come,lean to my wound; burn on, burn on.","After nineteen years of running after good marks and prizes and grants of one sort or another, I was letting up, slowing down, dropping clean out of the race.","I liked looking at other people in crucial situations. If there was a road accident or a street fight or a baby pickled in a laboratory jar for me to look at, I\'d stop and look so hard I never forgot it.","Little poppies, little hell flames, Do you do no harm?You flicker. I cannot touch you. I put my hands among the flames. Nothing burns.","She has foldedThem back into her body as petalsOf a rose close when the garden Stiffens and odours bleedFrom the sweet, deep throats of the night flower. The moon has nothing to be sad about, Staring from her hood of bone.","Ordering drinks always floored me. I didn\'t know whisky from gin andnever managed to get anything I really liked the taste of. Buddy Willard andthe other college boys I knew were usually too poor to buy hard liquor orthey scorned drinking altogether. It\'s amazing how many college boys don\'tdrink or smoke. I seemed to know them all. The farthest Buddy Willard everwent was buying us a bottle of Dubonnet, which he only did because he wastrying to prove he could be aesthetic in spite of being a medical student.\\"I\'ll have a vodka,\\" I said.The man looked at me more closely. \\"With anything?\\"\\"Just plain,\\" I said. \\"I always have it plain.\\"I thought I might make a fool of myself by saying I\'d have it with iceor gin or anything. I\'d seen a vodka ad once, just a glass full of vodkastanding in the middle of a snowdrift in a blue light, and the vodka lookedclear and pure as water, so I thought having vodka plain must be all right.My dream was someday ordering a drink and finding out it tasted wonderful.","...love knows not of death nor calculus above the simple sum of heart plus heart.","I went to the bronze boy whom I love, partly because no one really cares for him","I decided I would put off the novel until I had gone to Europe and had a lover, and that I would never learn a word of shorthand. If I never learned shorthand I would never have to use it. I thought I would spend the summer reading \\"Finnegan\'s Wake\\" and writing my thesis. Then I would be way ahead when college started at the end of September, and able to enjoy my last year instead of swotting away with no make up and stringy hair, on a diet of Benzedrine, the way most of the seniors taking honors did, until they finished their thesis. Then I thought I might put off college for a year and apprentice myself to a pottery maker.Or work my way to Germany and be a waitress, until I was bilingual.Then plan after plan started leaping through my head, like a family of scatty rabbits. I saw the years of my life spaced along a road in the form of telephone poles, threaded together by the wires. I counted one, two, three.... nineteen telephone poles dangled in space, and try as I would, I couldn\'t see a single pole beyond the nineteenth.","Look at that ugly dead mask here and do not forget it. It is a chalk mask with dead dry poison behind it, like the death angel. It is what was this fall, and what I never want to be again. The pouting disconsolate mouth, the flat, bored, numb, expressionless eyes: symptoms of the foul decay within.","The color scheme of the whole sanatorium seemed to be based on liver. Dark, glowering woodwork, burnt-brown leather chairs, walls that might once have been white but had succumbed under a spreading malady of mod or damp. A mottled brown linoleum sealed off the floor.","The sight of all the food stacked in those kitchens made me dizzy. It\'s not that we hadn\'t enough to eat at home, it\'s just that my grandmother always cooked economy joints and economy meat loafs and had the habit of saying, the minute you lifted the first forkful to your mouth, \\"I hope you enjoy that, it cost forty-one cents a pound,\\" which always made me feel I was somehow eating pennies instead of Sunday roast.","It all flowed over me with a screaming ache of pain\xa0\u2026\xa0remember, remember, this is now, and now, and now. Live it, feel it, cling to it. I want to become acutely aware of all I\u2019ve taken for granted. When you feel that this may be the good-bye, the last time, it hits you harder.","Why do my beheld beauties vanish and deform themselves as soon as I look twice.","...Life happens so hard and fast I sometimes wonder who is me...","Me sent\xeda muy tranquila y muy vac\xeda, como debe de sentirse el ojo de un tornado que se mueve con ruido sordo en medio del estr\xe9pito circundante.","This is the light of the mind, cold and planetary.The trees of the mind are black. The light is blue.","Stupid girl. You will never win anyone through pity. You must create the right kind of dream, the sober, adult kind of magic: illusion born from disillusion.","It\'s the living, the eating, the sleeping that everyone needs. Ideas don\'t matter so much after all. My three best friends are Catholic. I can\'t see their beliefs, but I can see the things they love to do on earth. When you come right down to it, I do believe in the freedom of the individual\u2026","I dreamed that you bewitched me into bed And sung me moon-struck, Kissed me quite insane. (I think I made you up inside my head.)","I saw the gooseflesh on my skin. I did not know what made it. I was not cold. Had a ghost passed over? No, it was the poetry. A spark flew off Arnold and shook me, like a chill. I wanted to cry; I felt very odd. I had fallen into a new way of being happy.","I\u2019m not afraid of being lost. We all wander off from time to time. It\u2019s the fear of never quite finding myself that keeps me up at night.","Can nothingness be so prodigal?","Its snaky acids kiss.It petrifies the will. These are the isolate, slow faults That kill, that kill, that kill.","What is it that teaching kills? The juice, the sap - the substance of revelation: by making even the insoluble questions & multiple possible answers take on the granite assured stance of dogma. It does not kill this quick of life in students who come, each year, fresh, quick, to be awakened & pass on - but it kills the quick in me by forcing to formula the great visions, the great collocations and cadences of words and meanings. The good teacher, the proper teacher, must be everliving in faith and ever-renewed in creative energy to keep the sap packed in herself, himself, as well as the work. I do not have the energy, or will to use the energy I have, and it would take all, to keep this flame alive.","Vi mi vida extendiendo sus ramas frente a m\xed como la higuera verde del cuento.De la punta de cada rama, como si de un grueso higo morado se tratara, pend\xeda un maravilloso futuro, se\xf1alado y rutilante.

Education is of the most satisfying and available nature. I am at Smith! Which two years ago was a doubtful dream - and that fortuitous change of dream to reality has led me to desire more, and to lash myself onward - onward.","Love is a shadow.How you lie and cry after it.","Neurotic, ha!\\" I let out a scornful laugh. \\"If neurotic is wanting two mutually exclusive things at one and the same time, then I\'m neurotic as hell. I\'ll be flying back and forth between one mutually exclusive thing and another for the rest of my days.","The last thing I wanted was infinite security and to be the place an arrow shoots off from. I wanted change and excitement and to shoot off in all directions myself, like the coloured arrows from a Fourth of July rocket.","This was the best time of the day, when I could lie in the vague twilight, drifting off to sleep, making up dreams inside my head the way they should go.","Spiderlike, I spin mirrors,Loyal to my image.","I cry at everything. Simply to spite myself and embarrass myself.","I am afraid of getting older...I am afraid of getting married.

It was a relief to be free of the animal, but it seemed to have taken my spirit with it, and everything else it could lay its paws on.","I plummeted down past the zigzaggers, the students, the experts, through year after year of doubleness and smiles and compromise, into my own past.","They might ignore me immediately. In my moon suit and funeral veil. I am no source of honeySo why should they turn on me?Tomorrow I will be sweet God, I will set them free.","He paused, then, I behind him, arms locked around the powerful ribs, fingers caressing him. To lie with him, to lie with him, burning forgetful in the delicious animal fire. Locked first upright, thighs ground together, shuddering, mouth to mouth, breast to breast, legs enmeshed, then lying full length, with the good heavy weight of body upon body, arching, undulating, blind, growing together, force fighting force: to kill? To drive into burning dark of oblivion? To lose identity? Not love, this, quite. But something else rather. A refined hedonism. Hedonism: because of the blind sucking mouthing fingering quest for physical gratification. Refined: because of the desire to stimulate another in return, not being quite only concerned for self alone, but mostly so. An easy end to arguments on the mouth: a warm meeting of mouths, tongues quivering, licking, tasting. An easy substitute for bad slashing with angry hating teeth and nails and voice: the curious musical tempo of hands lifting under breasts, caressing throat, shoulders, knees, thighs. And giving up to the corrosive black whirlpool of mutual necessary destruction. - Once there is the first kiss, then the cycle becomes inevitable. Training, conditioning, make a hunger burn in breasts and secrete fluid in vagina, driving blindly for destruction. What is it but destruction? Some mystic desire to beat to sensual annihilation - to snuff out one\u2019s identity on the identity of the other - a mingling and mangling of identities? A death of one? Or both? A devouring and subordination? No, no. A polarization rather - a balance of two integrities, changing, electrically, one with the other, yet with centers of coolness, like stars. And there it is: when asked what role I will plan to fill, I say \u201cWhat do you mean role? I plan not to step into a part on marrying - but to go on living as an intelligent mature human being, growing and learning as I always have. No shift, no radical change in life habits. Never will there be a circle, signifying me and my operations, confined solely to home, other womenfolk, and community service, enclosed in the larger worldly circle of my mate, who brings home from his periphery of contact with the world the tales only of vicarious experience to me.No, rather, there will be two over-lapping circles, with a certain strong riveted center of common ground, but both with separate arcs jutting out in the world. A balanced tension; adaptible to circumstances, in which there is an elasticity of pull, tension, yet firm unity. Two stars, polarized; in moments of communication that is complete, almost fusing onto one. But fusion is an undesirable impossibility - and quite non-durable. So there will be no illusion of that.So he accuses me of \u201cstruggling for dominance\u201d? Sorry, wrong number. Sure, I\u2019m a little scared of being dominated. (Who isn\u2019t? Just the submissive, docile, milky type of individual. And that is Not he, Not me.) But that doesn\u2019t mean I, ipso facto, want to dominate. No, it is not a black-and-white choice or alternative like: \u201cEither-I\u2019m-victorious on-top-or-you-are.\u201dIt is only balance that I ask for.\u201d","Love set you going like a fat gold watch.","The woman is perfected.Her deadBody wears the smile of accomplishment,The illusion of a Greek necessityFlows in the scrolls of her toga,Her bareFeet seem to be saying:We have come so far, it is over.Each dead child coiled, a white serpent,One at each littlePitcher of milk, now empty.She has foldedThem back into her body as petalsOf a rose close when the gardenStiffens and odors bleedFrom the sweet, deep throats of the night flower.The moon has nothing to be sad about,Staring from her hood of bone.She is used to this sort of thing.Her blacks crackle and drag.","It is raining. I am tempted to write a poem. But I remember what it said on one rejection slip: After a heavy rainfall, poems titled RAIN pour in from across the nation.","I couldn\u2019t stand the idea of a woman having to have a single pure life and a man being able to have a double life, one pure and one not.","How long can I be a wall, keeping the wind off?How long can I beGentling the sun with the shade of my hand,Intercepting the blue bolts of a cold moon?The voices of loneliness, the voices of sorrowLap at my back ineluctably.How shall it soften them, this little lullaby?","After all, I wasn\'t crippled in any way, I just studied too hard, I didn\'t know when to stop.","To feel the tender skin of sensitive child-fingers thicken; to feel the sex organs develop and call loudly to the flesh; to become aware of school, exams (the very words as unlovely as the sound of chalk shrilling on the blackboard,) bread and butter, marriage, sex, compatibility, war, economics, death and self. What a pathetic blighting of the beauty and reality of childhood.","She looked terrible, but very wise.","Perhaps you considered yourself an oracle, Mouthpiece of the dead, or of some god or other.Thirty years now I have laboredTo dredge the silt from your throat.I am none the wiser.","We shall by morningInherit the earth. Our foot\'s in the door.","This woman lawyer said the best men wanted to be pure for their wives, and even if they weren\'t pure, they wanted to be the ones to teach their wives about sex. Of course they would try to persuade a girl to have sex and say they would marry her later, but assoon as she gave in, they would lose all respect for her and start saying that if she did that with them she would do that with other men and they would end up by making her lifemiserable.","Here I am, a bundle of past recollections and future dreams, knotted up in a reasonably attractive bundle of flesh. I remember what this flesh has gone through; I dream of what it may go through. I record here the actions of optical nerves, of taste buds, of sensory perception. And, I think: I am but one more drop in the great sea of matter, defined, with the ability to realize my existence. Of the millions, I, too, was potentially everything at birth. I, too, was stunted, narrowed, warped, by my environment, my outcroppings of heredity. I, too, will find a set of beliefs, of standards to live by, yet the very satisfaction of finding them will be marred by the fact that I have reached the ultimate in shallow, two-dimensional living - a set of values. This loneliness will blur and diminish, no doubt, when tomorrow I plunge again into classes, into the necessity of studying for exams. But now, that false purpose is lifted and I am spinning in a temporary vacuum. At home I rested and played, here, where I work, the routine is momentarily suspended and I am lost. There is no living being on earth at this moment except myself. I could walk down the halls, and empty rooms would yawn mockingly at me from every side. God, but life is loneliness, despite all the opiates, despite the shrill tinsel gaiety of \\"parties\\" with no purpose, despite the false grinning faces we all wear. And when at last you find someone to whom you feel you can pour out your soul, you stop in shock at the words you utter - they are so rusty, so ugly, so meaningless and feeble from being kept in the small cramped dark inside you so long. Yes, there is joy, fulfillment and companionship - but the loneliness of the soul in it\'s appalling self-consciousness, is horrible and overpowering.","I am aware, sure, I am aware. Catastrophically aware.","Yet I liked him too much\u2026 way too much, and I ripped him out of my heart so it wouldn\u2019t get to hurt me more than it did.","I love you because you are me ... my writing, my desire to be many lives. I will be a little god in my small way. My happiness streams from having wrenched a piece out of my life, a piece of hurt and beauty, and transformed it to typewritten words on paper. I am justifying my life, my keen emotion, my feeling, by turning it into print.","Water will run by rule; the actual sun / Will scrupulously rise and set; / No little man lives in the exacting moon / And that is that, is that, is that.","Slowly I swam up from the bottom of a black sleep.","Your shelled bed I remember.Father, this thick air is murderous.I would breathe water.","What a man wants is is an arrow into the future and what a woman is is the place the arrow shoots off from.","I was a terrible dancer. I couldn\'t carry a tune. I had no sense of balance, and when we had to walk down a narrow board with our hands out and a book on our heads in gym class I always fell over. I couldn\'t ride a horse or ski, the two things I wanted to do most, because they cost too much money. I couldn\'t speak German or read Hebrew or write Chinese.

After a climb, an ascent from one jagged foothold to another, a natural shelf is reached where one person can stretch at length, and stare down into the tide rising and falling below, or beyond to the bay, where sails catch light, then shadow, then light, as they tack far out near the horizon. The sun has burned these rocks, and the great continuous ebb and flow of the tide has crumbled the boulders, battered them, worn them down to the smooth sun-scalded stones on the beach which rattle and shift underfoot as one walks over them. A serene sense of the slow inevitability of the gradual changes in the earth\u2019s crust comes over me; a consuming love, not of a god, but of the clean unbroken sense that the rocks, which are nameless, the waves which are nameless, the ragged grass, which is nameless, are all defined momentarily through the consciousness of the being who observes them. With the sun burning into rock and flesh, and the wind ruffling grass and hair, there is an awareness that the blind immense unconscious impersonal and neutral forces will endure, and that the fragile, miraculously knit organism which interprets them, endows them with meaning, will move about for a little, then falter, fail, and decompose at last into the anonomous [sic] soil, voiceless, faceless, without identity.From this experience I emerged whole and clean, bitten to the bone by sun, washed pure by the icy sharpness of salt water, dried and bleached to the smooth tranquillity that comes from dwelling among primal things.From this experience also, a faith arises to carry back to a human world of small lusts and deceitful pettiness. A faith, na\xefve and child like perhaps, born as it is from the infinite simplicity of nature. It is a feeling that no matter what the ideas or conduct of others, there is a unique rightness and beauty to life which can be shared in openness, in wind and sunlight, with a fellow human being who believes in the same basic principles.","They mistake their star, these papery godfolk.","I don\'t see what women see in other women, I told Doctor Nolan in my interview that noon.

Only in the rain, sometimes, only when the rain comes, closing in your pitifully small radius of activity, only when you sit and listen by the window, as the cold wet air blows thinly by the back of your neck - only then do you think and feel sick. You feel the days slipping by, elusive as slippery pink worms, through your fingers, and you wonder what you have for your eighteen years, and you think about how, with difficulty and concentration, you could bring back a day, a day of sun, blue skies and watercoloring by the sea. You could remember the sensual observations that made that day reality, and you could delude yourself into thinking - almost - that you could return to the past, and relive the days and hours in a quick space of time. But no, the quest of time past is more difficult than you think, and time present is eaten up by such plaintive searchings. The film of your days and nights is wound up tight in you, never to be re-run - and the occasional flashbacks are faint, blurred, unreal, as if seen through falling snow. Now, you begin to get scared. You don\'t believe in God, or a life-after-death, so you can\'t hope for sugar plums when your non-existent soul rises. You believe that whatever there is has got to come from man, and man is pretty creative in his good moments - pretty mature, pretty perceptive for his age - how many years is it, now? How many thousands? Yet, yet in this era of specialization, of infinite variety and complexity and myriad choices, what do you pick for yourself out of the grab-bag? Cats have nine lives, the saying goes. You have one; and somewhere along the thin, tenuous thread of your existence there is the black knot, the blood clot, the stopped heartbeat that spells the end of this particular individual which is spelled \\"I\\" and \\"You\\" and \\"Sylvia.\\" So you wonder how to act, and how to be - and you wonder about values and attitudes. In the relativism and despair, in the waiting for the bombs to begin, for the blood (now spurting in Korea, in Germany, in Russia) to flow and trickle before your own eyes, you wonder with a quick sick fear how to cling to earth, to the seeds of grass and life. You wonder about your eighteen years, ricocheting between a stubborn determination that you\'ve done well for your own capabilities and opportunities... that you\'re competing now with girls from all over America, and not just from the hometown: and a fear that you haven\'t done well enough - You wonder if you\'ve got what it takes to keep building up obstacle courses for your self, and to keep leaping through them, sprained ankle or not. Again the refrain, what have you for your eighteen years? And you know that whatever tangible things you do have, they cannot be held, but, too, will decompose and slip away through your coarse-skinned and death-rigid fingers. So you will rot in the ground, and so you say, what the hell? Who cares? But you care, and somehow you don\'t want to live just one life, which could be typed, which could be tossed off in a thumbnail sketch = \\"She was the sort of girl....

As we become polished, so do we become hardened and guilty of accepting eating, sleeping, seeing, and hearing too easily and lazily, without question. We become blunt and callous and blissfully passive as each day adds another drop to the stagnant well of our years.","The consequences of love affairs would stop me from my independent freedom of creative activity, and I don\'t intend to be stopped.","But women have lust, too.

A serene sense of the slow inevitability of the gradual changes in the earth\'s crust comes over me; a consuming love, not of a god, but of the clean unbroken sense that the rocks, which are nameless, the waves which are nameless, the ragged grass, which is nameless, are all defined momentarily through the consciousness of the being who observes them. With the sun burning into rock and flesh, and the wind ruffling grass and hair, there is an awareness that the blind immense unconscious impersonal and neutral forces will endure, and that the fragile, miraculously knit organism which interprets them, endows them with meaning, will move about for a little, then falter, fail, and decompose at last into the anonomous soil, voiceless, faceless, without identity.","They missed every time, and with that wary judgment that comes with experience, I watched the dirty snowballs coming at me, behind and in front, and, sick with wonder, kept walking slowly, determinedly, ready to parry a good hit before it struck.

To grab temporary security? What avail are brains? Merely to say \\"I have seen;I have comprehended?\\" Ah yes, I hate myself for not being able to go downstairs naturally and seek comfort in numbers. I hate myself for having to sit here and be torn between I know not what within me. Here I am, a bundle of past recollections and future dreams, knotted up in a reasonably attractive bundle of flesh. I remember what this flesh has gone through; I dream of what it may go through.","So I began to think maybe it was true that when you were married and had children it was like being brainwashed, and afterwards you went about numb as a slave in some private, totalitarian state.","Avocados are my favourite fruit.","When we came out of the sunnily lit interior of the Ladies\' Day offices, the streets were gray and fuming with rain. It wasn\u2019t the nice kind of rain that rinses. you clean, but the sort of rain I imagine they must have in Brazil. It flew straight down from the sky in drops the size of coffee saucers and hit the hot sidewalks with a hiss that sent clouds of steam writhing up from the gleaming, dark concrete.","I saw myself sitting in the crotch of this fig tree, starving to death, just because I couldn\u2019t make up my mind which of the figs I would choose. I wanted each and every one of them, but choosing one meant losing all the rest, and, as I sat there, unable to decide, the figs began to wrinkle and go black, and, one by one, they plopped to the ground at my feet.","And this is how it stiffens, my vision of that seaside childhood.

Otherwise there is no i because i am what other people interpret me as being and am nothing if there were no people.","And while Constantin and I sat in one of those hushed plush auditoriums in the UN, next to a stern muscular Russian girl with no makeup who was a simultaneous interpreter like Constantin, I thought how strange it had never occurred to me before that I was only purely happy until I was nine years old.","Finally I decided that if it was so difficult to find a redblooded intelligent man who was still pure by the time he was twenty-one I might as well forget about staying pure myself and marry somebody who wasn\u2019t pure either. Then when he started to make my life miserable I could make his miserable as well.","I am not a smile.These children are after something,with hooks and cries,And my heart too small to bandage their terrible faults.","Eccentricities, the perils of being too special, were reasoned and cooed from us like sucked thumbs.","The silence drew off, baring the pebbles and shells and all the tatty wreckage of my life. Then, at the rim of my vision, it gathered itself, and in one sweeping tide, rushed me to sleep.","His eyelashes were so long and thick they looked artificial.

Is it for such I agitate my heart?","Something maternal awakened, perhaps, by the physical contact with such lovely young babies? And tonight was a good night, thus I feel correspondingly tender. There will be other bad nights, but remembering the versatile quicksilver shifting of children\'s moods, I smile with equanimity and do not cherish grudges, as most of us adults do, letting them fester like a cancer. But I let my emotions run on the same forgiving and transient track.","\u2013 Today is the first of August. It is hot, steamy and wet. It is raining. I am tempted to write a poem.

I always have, ever since I was a child. There are so many subtle variations of sensation. A delicate, pointed-nailed fifth finger can catch under dry scabs and flakes of mucus in the nostril and draw them out to be looked at, crumbled between fingers, and flicked to the floor in minute crusts. Or a heavier, determined forefinger can reach up and smear down-and-out the soft, resilient, elastic greenish-yellow smallish blobs of mucus, roll them round and jellylike between thumb and forefinger, and spread them on the under-surface of a desk or chair where they will harden into organic crusts. How many desks and chairs have I thus secretively befouled since childhood? Or sometimes there will be blood mingled with the mucus: in dry brown scabs, or bright sudden wet red on the finger that scraped too rudely the nasal membranes. God, what a sexual satisfaction! It is absorbing to look with new sudden eyes on the old worn habits: to see a sudden luxurious and pestilential \u201csnot-green sea, and shiver with the shock of recognition.\u201d","Si uno no espera nada de alguien nunca se siente desilusionado.","If I had to strain my brain with any more of that stuff I would go mad.","There are a few times when the songs that are written, the poems that are written, the plays that are written, come alive.

Well, from where I sit, I figure the world is run by one thing and this one thing only. Panic with a dog-face, devil-face, hag-face, whore-face, panic in capital letters with no face at all\u2014it\u2019s the same Johnny Panic, awake or asleep.","The only trouble was, Church, even the Catholic Church, didn\'t take up the whole of your life.

To be a part of this journey called life. To be one of the lucky 7 billion. Why was I chosen to be here? I must have a meaning, right? There\'s a big picture already painted of my life, my legacy, my happiness. I just have to trust in it.","That\'s one of the reasons I never wanted to get married. The last thing I wanted was infinite security and to be the place an arrow shoots off from. I wanted change and excitement and to shoot off in all directions myself, like the colored arrows from a Fourth of July rocket.","But perhaps the most overlooked feature of her life was that she was human, and therefore fallible.","The moon has nothing to be sad about,Staring from her hood of bone.She is used to this type of thing.Her blacks crackle and drag.","The voice came from a cool, rational region far above my head.","Winning or losing an argument, receiving an acceptance or rejection, is no proof of the validity or value of personal identity.","You could remember the sensual observations that made that day reality, and you could delude yourself into thinking - almost - that you could return to the past, and relive the days and hours in a quick space of time. But no, the quest of time past is more difficult than you think, and time present is eaten up by such plaintive searchings. The film of your days and nights is wound up tight in you, never to be re-run - and the occasional flashbacks are faint, blurred, unreal, as if seen through falling snow.","39. \\"Is there no way out of the mind?","\u0130stedi\u011fim b\xfct\xfcn kitaplar\u0131 okuyamam, olmak istedi\u011fim b\xfct\xfcn insanlar olamam ve istedi\u011fim hayatlar\u0131 s\xfcremem, istedi\u011fim b\xfct\xfcn becerileri edinemem. \xd6yleyse ne istiyorum?","I looked up from that churning amphitheater to the view beyond it.

She\u2019d spent weeks on that rug, and I had admired the tweedy browns and greens and blues patterning the braid, but after Mrs Willard was through, instead of hanging the rug on the wall the way I would have done, she put it down in place of her kitchen mat, and in a few days it was soiled and dull and indistinguishable from any mat you could buy for under a dollar in the Five and Ten.And I knew that in spite of all the roses and kisses and restaurant dinners a man showered on a woman before he married her, what he secretly wanted when the wedding service ended was for her to flatten out underneath his feet like Mrs Willard\u2019s kitchen mat.","I was quite proud of the calm way I stared at all these gruesome things.","I fixed my eyes on the largest cloud, as if, when it passed out of sight, I might have the good luck to pass with it.","I am alone in my room, between two worlds.","What did my fingers do before they held him?What did my heart do, with its love?","Unless you can be yourself, you won\'t stay with anyone for long.","And by the way, everything in life is writeable if you have the outgoing guts to do it, and the imagination to improvise.

You could try, perhaps, but they would be much the same as yours... for you are all an inexplicable unity - this family group with its twisted tensions, unreasoning loves and solidarity and loyalty born and bred in blood. These people are the ones most basically responsible for what you are.","As for free will, there is such a narrow crack of it for man to move in, crushed as he is from birth by environment, heredity, time and event and local convention. If I had been born of Italian parents in one of the caves in the hills I would be a prostitute at the age of 12 or so because I had to live (why?) and that was the only way open. If I was born into a wealthy New York family with pseudo-cultural leanings, I would have had my coming-out party along with the rest of them, and be equipped with fur coats, social contacts, and a blase pout. How do I know? I don\'t; I can only guess. I wouldn\'t be I. But I am I now; and so many other millions are so irretrievably their own special variety of \\"I\\" that I can hardly bear to think of it. I: how firm a letter; how reassuring the three strokes: one vertical, proud and assertive, and then the two short horizontal lines in quick, smug succession. The pen scratches on the paper... I... I... I... I... I... I.","I don\'t really know,\\" I heard myself say. I felt a deep shock, hearing myself say that, because the minute I said it, I knew it was true.","I felt Mr Willard had deserted me. I thought he must have planned it all along, but Buddy said No, his father simply couldn\'t stand the sight of sickness and especially his own son\'s sickness, because he thought all sickness was sickness of the will. Mr Willard had never been sick a day in his life.","For the first time in my life, sitting there in the soundproof heart of the UN building between Constantin who could play tennis as well as simultaneously interpret and the Russian girl who knew so many idioms, I felt dreadfully inadequate. The trouble was, I had been inadequate all along, I simply hadn\u2019t thought about it.","It is amusing to wonder whether dreams would matter at all, or \\"freedom\\" or \\"democracy.\\" I think not; I think there would only be the wondering what to eat and where to sleep and how to build out of the wreckage of life and mankind.","If you compare yourself with others, you may become vain or bitter\u2014for always there will be greater and lesser persons than yourself.\u2026","No, I won\'t try to escape myself by losing myself in artificial chatter.","Elaine sat on the breezeway in an old yellow nightgown of her mother\'s waiting for something to happen.\' [...] I sat like that for about an hour, trying to think what would come next, and in my mind, the barefoot doll in her mother\'s old yellow nightgown sat and stared into space as well.","I feel like a very efficient tool or weapon, used and in demand from moment to moment...","Lord, what will I be? Where will the careless conglomeration of environment, heredity and stimulus lead me? Someday I may say: It was of great significance that I sat and laughed at myself in a convertible with the rain coming down in rattling sheets on the canvas roof. It influenced my life that I did not find content immediately and easily - - and now I am I because of that. It was inestimably important for me to look at the lights of Amherstn town in the rain, with the wet black tree-skeletons against the limpid streetlights and gray November mist, and then look at the boy beside me and feel all the hurting beauty go flat because he wasn\'t the right one - not at all. And I may say that my philosophy has been deeply affected by the fact that windshield wipers ticked off seconds too loudly and hopelessly, that my clock drips loud sharp clicks too monotonously on my hearing. I can hear it even through the pillow I muffle it with - the tyrannical drip drip drip drip of seconds along the night. And in the day, even when I\'m not there, the seconds come out in little measured strips of time. And I wind the clock. And I look at the windshield wipers cutting an arch out of the sprinkled raindrops on the glass. Click-click. Clip-clip. Tick-tick. snip-snip. And it goes on and on. I could smash the measured clicking sound that haunts me - draining away life, and dreams, and idle reveries. Hard, sharp, ticks. I hate them. Measuring thought, infinite space, by cogs and wheels. Can you understand? Someone, somewhere, can you understand me a little, love me a little? For all my despair, for all my ideals, for all that - I love life. But it is hard, and I have so much - so very much to learn.","In that valley the train shrieks echo like souls on hooks.","Every second the city gets smaller and smaller, only you feel it\'s really you getting smaller and smaller and lonelier and lonelier, rushing away from all those lights and that excitement at about a million miles and hour.","The thought that I might kill myself formed in my mind cooly as a tree or a flower.","The room blued into view, and I wondered where the night had gone.","A small, answering point in my own body flew toward it. I felt my lungs inflate with the inrush of scenery- air, mountains, trees, people. I thought, \\"This is what it is to be happy.","I looked at the baby in the lap of the woman opposite.

It was as if what I wanted to kill wasn\u2019t in that skin or the thin blue pulse that jumped under my thumb, but somewhere else, deeper, more secret, and a whole lot harder to get at.","What I fear most I think, is the death of the imagination.","He fathomed her, enclosed her. He did not see, or did not care to see, how her submissiveness moved and drew him, nor how now, through the steaming, suffocating baths of mist, she led him, and he followed, though the rainbows under the clear water were lost.","You fool \u2013 you are afraid of being alone with you own mind. You just better learn to know yourself, to make sure decisions before it is too late. Your room is not your prison. You are.","Later Buddy told me the woman was on a drug that would make her forget she\'d had any pain and that when she swore and groaned she really didn\'t know what she was doing because she was in a kind of twilight sleep. I thought it sounded just like the sort of drug a man would invent. Here was a woman in terrible pain, obviously feeling every bit of it or she wouldn\'t groan like that, and she would go straight home and start another baby, because the drug would make her forget how bad the pain had been, when all the time, in some secret part of her, that long, blind, doorless and windowless corridor of pain was waiting to open up and shut her in again.","There is something demoralising about watching two people get more and more crazy about each other, especially when you are the only extra person in that room","I am an observer.","I could tell Marco was a woman-hater, because in spite of all the models and TV starlets in the room that night he paid attention to nobody but me. Not out of kindness or even curiosity, but because I\'d happened to be dealt to him, like a playing card in a pack of identical cards.","I don\'t know what it is like to not have deep emotions. Even when I feel nothing, I feel it completely","I began to see why woman-haters could make such fools of women. Women-haters were like gods: invulnerable and chockfull of power. They descended, and then they disappeared. You could never catch one.","If I could bleed, or sleep! If my mouth could marry a hurt like that!","Anyway, there are two tentative solutions for getting rid of selfishness - both involving a stoic casting - off of the thin tenuous little identity which I love and cherish so dearly - and being confident that, once on the other side, I shall never miss my own little ambitions for my conceited self, but shall be content in serving the ambitions of my mate, or of a society, or cause. (Yet I will not, I cannot accept any of those solutions. Why? Stubborn selfish pride. I will not make what is inevitable easier for my-self by the blinding ignorance-is-bliss \\"losing-and-finding\\" theory. Oh, no! I will go, eyes open, into my torture, and remain fully cognizant, unwinking, while they cut and stitch and lop off my cherished malignant organs.) So much for selflove: I carry it with me like a dear cancerous relative - to be disposed of only when desperation sets in.","It was inestimably important for me to look at the lights of Amherst town in the rain, with the wet black tree-skeletons against the limpid streetlights and gray November mist, and then look at the boy beside me and feel all the hurting beauty go flat because he wasn\'t the right one-not at all.","All through June the writing course had stretched before me like a bright, safe bridge over the dull gulf of summer.

We\'re still nothing but animals.","I was thinking that if I\'d had the sense to go on living in that old town I might just have met this prison guard in school and married him and had a parcel of kids now. It would be nice, living by the sea with piles of kids and pigs and chickens, wearing what my grandmother called wash dresses, and sitting about in some kitchen with bright linoleum and fat arms, drinking pots of coffee.","Fixed stars govern a life","The only problem was, Church, even the Catholic Church, didn\'t take up the whole of your life No matter how much you knelt and prayed, you still had to eat three meals a day and have a job and live in the world.","LoreleiIt is no night to drown in:A full moon, river lapsingBlack beneath bland mirror-sheen,The blue water-mists droppingScrim after scrim like fishnetsThough fishermen are sleeping,The massive castle turretsDoubling themselves in a glassAll stillness. Yet these shapes floatUp toward me, troubling the faceOf quiet. From the nadirThey rise, their limbs ponderousWith richness, hair heavierThan sculptured marble. They singOf a world more full and clearThan can be. Sisters, your songBears a burden too weightyFor the whorled ear\'s listeningHere, in a well-steered country,Under a balanced ruler.Deranging by harmonyBeyond the mundane order,Your voices lay siege. You lodgeOn the pitched reefs of nightmare,Promising sure harborage;By day, descant from bordersOf hebetude, from the ledgeAlso of high windows. WorseEven than your maddeningSong, your silence. At the sourceOf your ice-hearted calling-Drunkenness of the great depths.O river, I see driftingDeep in your flux of silverThose great goddesses of peace.Stone, stone, ferry me down there.","People and trees receded on either hand like the dark sides of a tunnel as I hurtled on to the still, bright point at the end of it, the pebble at the bottom of the well, the white sweet baby cradled in its mother\'s belly.","The eyes and the faces all turned themselves towards me, and guiding myself by them, as by a magical thread, I stepped into the room.","Sunt o persoan\u0103 important\u0103.

So I walkAway on wheels, instead of legs, they serve as well.And learn to speak with fingers, not a tongue.The body is resourceful.","Through portico of my elegant house you stalk With your wild furies, disturbing garlands of fruit And the fabulous lutes and peacocks, rending the netOf all decorum which holds the whirlwind back. Now, rich order of walls is fallen; rooks croak Above the appalling ruin; in bleak light Of your stormy eye, magic takes flight Like a daunted witch, quitting castle when real days break. Fractured pillars frame prospects of rock; While you stand heroic in coat and tie, I sit Composed in Grecian tunic and psyche-knot, Rooted to your black look, the play turned tragic: Which such blight wrought on our bankrupt estate, What ceremony of words can patch the havoc?\\"Conversation Among the Ruins","The silence depressed me. It wasn\'t the silence of silence. It was my own silence.I knew perfectly well the cars were making noise, and the people in them and behind the lit windows of the buildings were making noise, and the river was making a noise, but I couldn\'t hear a thing. The city hung in my window, flat as a poster, glittering and blinking, but it might just as well not have been there at all, for all the good it did me.","Waiting for the right wonderful person is so much more important than getting the outer comforts of marriage at an early age.","Poppies in JulyLittle poppies, little hell flames,Do you do no harm?You flicker. I cannot touch you.I put my hands among the flames. Nothing burns.And it exhausts me to watch youFlickering like that, wrinkly and clear red, like the skin of a mouth.A mouth just bloodied.Little bloody skirts!There are fumes that I cannot touch.Where are your opiates, your nauseous capsules?If I could bleed, or sleep!If my mouth could marry a hurt like that!Or your liquors seep to me, in this glass capsule,Dulling and stilling.But colorless. Colorless.","There must be quite a few things a hot bath won\u2019t cure, but I don\u2019t know many of them. Whenever I\u2019m sad I\u2019m going to die, or so nervous I can\u2019t sleep, or in love with somebody I won\u2019t be seeing for a week, I slump down just so far and then I say: \u201cI\u2019ll go take a hot bath.","I thought it would be the way I\'d feel if I ever visited Europe. I\'d come home, and if I looked closely into the mirror I\'d be able to make out a little white Alp at the back of my eye. Now I thought that if I looked closely into the mirror I\u2019d see a doll-size Constantin sitting in my eye and smiling out at me","Always him. Damn, what is the matter with me? Is it because I want somebody to orient myself about that I\'m drawn to him, or am I drawn to him because he is exactly the sort of person I want to orient myself about?","Some girl a hundred years ago once lived as I do. And she is dead. I am the present, but I know I, too, will pass. The high moment, the burning flash, come and are gone, continuous quicksand. And I don\u2019t want to die.","Five balls! Five bright brass balls!To juggle with, my love, when the sky falls.","...I would find the words to tell him how I was so scared, as if I were being stuffed farther and farther into a black, airless sack with no way out.","I\'d say go to hell, but I never want to see you again.","Why is it that I find it so difficult to accept the present moment, whole as an apple, without cutting and hacking at it to find a purpose, or setting it up on a shelf with other apples to measure its worth or trying to pickle it in brine to preserve it, and crying to find it turns all brown and is no longer simply the lovely apple I was given in the morning?","Hastanenin arazisi yeni ya\u011fm\u0131\u015f karla \xf6rt\xfcl\xfcyd\xfc -bu bir Noel serpintisi de\u011fil, ocak ay\u0131n\u0131n adam boyu kar\u0131yd\u0131, okullar\u0131, i\u015f yerlerini, kiliseleri kapatt\u0131r\u0131p bir g\xfcn boyunca ya da daha uzun s\xfcreyle not ve randevu defterlerinin, masa takvimlerinin \xfcst\xfcnde bombo\u015f, tertemiz bir sayfa b\u0131rakan t\xfcrden bir kar.","Ten\xeda que estar pas\xe1ndomelo en grande, ten\xeda que estar ilusionada como las otras chicas, pero no consegu\xeda reaccionar.

It all flowed over me with a screaming ache of pain... remember, remember, this is now, and now, and now. Live it, feel it, cling to it. I want to become acutely aware of all I\'ve taken for granted. When you feel that this may be the good-bye, the last time, it hits you harder.","The balled Pulp of your heart Confronts its small Mill of silence","Mental nausea of daily squashflabby cauliflowerand grease dripping slick and sheepishonto the placid plate of mind.","Thirty years now I have laboured to dredge the slit from your throat. I am none the wiser.","I felt very still and very empty, the way the eye of a tornado must feel, moving dully along in the middle of the surrounding hullabaloo.","From here to happiness is a road, flat, upright, distances in between blotted out by vision, yet realized by intelligence. From here to there is a road leading down blue pajamas to feet, to bed post, to screen door, to gray slatted porch roof, rain-puddled and drenched, to decorative white railing, to a road, to a line of sand, to a gray, rain beaten sea. Not yet to leave, not yet. For this road is a way to savor, a way back to living again as living is full. Not of bridge-playing, not of eating a frappe with two other girls, not even of talking with another. Aloneness and selfness are too important to betray for company.","Now I know how people can live without books, without college. (...)and so one goes on living, near the earth. At times like this I\'d call myself a fool to ask for more...","..it just seems that I am running on a purposeless treadmill, behind and paralyzed in science, dreading every day of the horrible year ahead when I should be reveling in my major.","I stepped from the air-conditioned compartment onto the station platform, and the motherly breath of the suburbs enfolded me. It smelt of lawn sprinklers and station wagons and tennis rackets and dogs and babies.","The Night Dances \xa0 \xa0 \xa0 A smile fell in the grass.

There is so much, and I am torn in different directions, pulled thin, taut against horizons too distant for me to reach. To stop with the German tribes and rest awhile: But no! On, on, on. Through ages of empires, of decline and fall. Swift, ceaseless pace. Will I never rest in sunlight again - slow, languid & golden with peace?","And I knew that in spite of all the roses and kisses and Restuarant dinners a man showered on a woman before he married her, what he secretly wanted when the wedding service ended was for her to flatten out underneath his feet like Mrs Willard\'s kitchen mat","Parecia haver fuma\xe7a saindo dos meus nervos, como aquela que sa\xeda das churrasqueiras e da estrada.

And there will be other summers, other band concerts, but never this one, never again, never as now. Next year I will not be the self of this year now.

I saw the days of the year stretching ahead like a series of bright, white boxes, and separating one box from another was sleep, like a black shade. Only for me, the long perspective of shades that set off one box from the next had suddenly snapped up, and I could see day after day after day glaring ahead of me like a white, broad, infinitely desolate avenue.","By\u0142o mi oboj\u0119tnie i bardzo pusto - tak musi by\u0107 w oku cyklonu.

And you remember a lot of nasty little tag ends of conversation directed at you and around you, meant for you, to strangle you on the invisible noose of insinuation. You know it was meant for you; so do they who stab you. But the game is for both of you to pretend you don\'t know, you don\'t really mean, you don\'t understand. Sometimes you can get a shot back in the same way, and you and your antagonist rival each other with brave smiles while the poison darts quiver, maliciously, in your mutual wounds. More often you are too sickened to fight back, because you know the fear and the inadequacy will crawl out in your words as they crackle falsely on the air. So you hear her say to you \\"We\'d rather flunk school and be sociable than stick in our rooms all the time,\\" and very sweetly \\"I never see you. You\'re always studying in your rooom!\\" And you keep your mouth shut. And oh, how you smile!","I felt if I didn\'t write nobody would accept me as a human being. Writing, then, was a substitute for myself: if you don\'t love me, love my writing and love me for my writing. It is also much more: a way of ordering and reordering the chaos of experience.","My consuming desire to mingle with road crews, sailors and soldiers, bar room regulars - to be a part of scene, anonymous, listening, recording - all is spoiled by the fact that I am a girl, a female always in danger of assault and battery.","Now I know how people can live without books, without college.

My consuming interest in men and their lives is often misconstrued as a desire to seduce them, or as an invitation to intimacy. Yet, God, I want to talk to everybody I can as deeply as I can. I want to be able to sleep in an open field, to travel west, to walk freely at night...\u2015 Sylvia Plath, The Unabridged Journals of Sylvia Plath\u201d","I cannot undo myself, and the train is steaming.","I am silver and exact.","It will be long before everyone is wiped out. People live in war time, they always have. There was terror down through history - and the men who saw the Spanish Armada sail over the rim of the world, who saw the Black death wipe out half of Europe, those men were frightened, terrified. But though they lived and died in fear, I am here; we have built again. And so I will belong to a dark age, and historians will say \\"We have few documents to show how the common people lived at this time. Records lead us to believe that a majority were killed. But there were glorious men.\\" And school children will sigh and learn the names of Truman and Senator McCarthy. Oh, it is hard for me to reconcile myself to this. But maybe this is why I am a girl - - - so I can live more safely than the boys I have known and envied, so I can bear children, and instill in them the biting eating desire to learn and love life which I will never quite fulfill, because there isn\'t time, because there isn\'t time at all, but instead the quick desperate fear, the ticking clock, and the snow which comes too suddenly upon the summer. Sure, I\'m dramatic and sloppily semi-cynical and semi-sentimental. But in leisure years I could grow and choose my way. Now I am living on the edge. We all are on the brink, and it takes a lot of nerve, a lot of energy, to teeter on the edge, looking over, looking down into the windy blackness and not being quite able to make out, through the yellow, stinking mist, just what lies below in the slime, in the oozing, vomit-streaked slime; and so I could go on, into my thoughts, writing much, trying to find the core, the meaning for myself. Perhaps that would help, to synthesize my ideas into a philosophy for me, now, at the age of eighteen, but the clock ticks, ah yes, \\"At my back I hear, time\'s winged chariot hovering near.\\" And I have too much conscience, too much habit to sit and stare at snow, thick now, and evenly white and muffling on the ground. God, I scream for time to let go, to write, to think. But no. I have to exercise my memory in little feats just so I can stay in this damn wonderful place which I love and hate with all my heart. And so the snow slows and swirls, and melts along the edges. The first snow isn\'t good for much. It makes a few people write poetry, a few wonder if the Christmas shopping is done, a few make reservations at the skiing lodge. It\'s a sentimental prelude to the real thing. It\'s picturesque & quaint.","Buddy hugged his father,and promptly, with a dreadful brightness, came over to me and held out his had.I shook it. It felt fat and moist.","I am sitting in my room, looking out at a scene of snow pouring down with ice and sleet and thinking of how sometimes people are really wonderful after all.","A daughter in an asylum!

I lie on a great anvil. The flat blue sky-circle Flew off like the hat of a doll When I fell out of the light. I entered The stomach of indifference, the wordless cupboard. The mother of pestles diminished me. I became a still pebble. The stones of the belly were peaceable, The head-stone quiet, jostled by nothing.","How can I go, meeting and exorcising my own ghosts here! I\'ve made some new ones now.","Only the mouth-hole piped out, Importunate cricket In a quarry of silences. The people of the city heard it. They hunted the stones, taciturn and separate, The mouth-hole crying their locations. Drunk as a fetus I suck at the paps of darkness. The food tubes embrace me. Sponges kiss my lichens away. The jewelmaster drives his chisel to pry Open one stone eye. This is the after-hell: I see the light. A wind unstoppers the chamber","With me, the present is forever, and forever is always shifting, flowing, melting. This second is life. And when it is gone it is dead.

A story, a picture, can renew sensation a little, but not enough, not enough. Nothing is real except the present, and already, I feel the weight of centuries smothering me. Some girl a hundred years ago once lived as I do. And she is dead. I am the present, but I know I, too, will pass. The high moment, the burning flash, come and are gone, continuous quicksand. And I don\'t want to die.","Of the ear, old worrier. Water mollifies the flint lip, And daylight lays its sameness on the wall. The grafters are cheerful, Heating the pincers, hoisting the delicate hammers. A current agitates the wires Volt upon volt. Catgut stitches my fissures. A workman walks by carrying a pink torso. The storerooms are full of hearts. This is the city of spare parts. My swaddled legs and arms smell sweet as rubber. Here they can doctor heads, or any limb.","I also remembered Buddy Willard saying in a sinister, knowing way that after I had children I would feel differently. I wouldn\'t want to write poems any more. So I began to think maybe it was true that when you were married and had children it was like being brainwashed, and afterward you went about numb as a slave in some private, totalitarian state.","See, the darkness is leaking from the cracks.I cannot contain it. I cannot contain my life","On Fridays the little children come To trade their hooks for hands. Dead men leave eyes for others. Love is the uniform of my bald nurse.

It was the combination of everything. Of the play \\"Goodbye My Fancy,\\" of wanting, in a juvenile way, to be, like the heroine, a reporter in the trenches, to be loved by a man who admired me, who understood me as much as I understood myself.","Esther knows nothing about alcohol, and says, \u201cMy dream was someday ordering a drink and finding out it tasted wonderful.","From here to happiness is a road, flat, upright, distances in between blotted out by vision, yet realized by intelligence.","The tulips are too excitable, it is winter here.Look how white everything is, how quiet, how snowed-in. I am learning peacefulness, lying by myself quietlyAs the light lies on these white walls, this bed, these hands. I am nobody; I have nothing to do with explosions. I have given my name and my day-clothes up to the nurses And my history to the anesthetist and my body to surgeons.They have propped my head between the pillow and the sheet-cuff Like an eye between two white lids that will not shut.Stupid pupil, it has to take everything in.The nurses pass and pass, they are no trouble,They pass the way gulls pass inland in their white caps,Doing things with their hands, one just the same as another, So it is impossible to tell how many there are.My body is a pebble to them, they tend it as waterTends to the pebbles it must run over, smoothing them gently.They bring me numbness in their bright needles, they bring me sleep. Now I have lost myself I am sick of baggage\u2014\u2014My patent leather overnight case like a black pillbox, My husband and child smiling out of the family photo; Their smiles catch onto my skin, little smiling hooks.I have let things slip, a thirty-year-old cargo boat stubbornly hanging on to my name and address.They have swabbed me clear of my loving associations. Scared and bare on the green plastic-pillowed trolley I watched my teaset, my bureaus of linen, my books Sink out of sight, and the water went over my head. I am a nun now, I have never been so pure.I didn\u2019t want any flowers, I only wantedTo lie with my hands turned up and be utterly empty.How free it is, you have no idea how free\u2014\u2014The peacefulness is so big it dazes you,And it asks nothing, a name tag, a few trinkets.It is what the dead close on, finally; I imagine them Shutting their mouths on it, like a Communion tablet. The tulips are too red in the first place, they hurt me.Even through the gift paper I could hear them breathe Lightly, through their white swaddlings, like an awful baby. Their redness talks to my wound, it corresponds.They are subtle : they seem to float, though they weigh me down, Upsetting me with their sudden tongues and their color, A dozen red lead sinkers round my neck.Nobody watched me before, now I am watched. The tulips turn to me, and the window behind meWhere once a day the light slowly widens and slowly thins, And I see myself, flat, ridiculous, a cut-paper shadow Between the eye of the sun and the eyes of the tulips, And I have no face, I have wanted to efface myself. The vivid tulips eat my oxygen.Before they came the air was calm enough,Coming and going, breath by breath, without any fuss. Then the tulips filled it up like a loud noise.Now the air snags and eddies round them the way a river Snags and eddies round a sunken rust-red engine. They concentrate my attention, that was happy Playing and resting without committing itself.The walls, also, seem to be warming themselves.The tulips should be behind bars like dangerous animals; They are opening like the mouth of some great African cat, And I am aware of my heart: it opens and closesIts bowl of red blooms out of sheer love of me.The water I taste is warm and salt, like the sea,And comes from a country far away as health.","I simply don\u2019t know what to do. All joy and hope is gone.","Face it, kid: unless you can be yourself, you won\u2019t stay with anyone for long. You\u2019ve got to be able to talk. That\u2019s tough.

At my feet, the city doused its lights in sleep, its buildings blackened, as if for a funeral.","Now I am surely becoming an incurable romantic.","And I knew in spite of all the roses and kisses and restaurant dinners a man showered on a woman before he married her, what he secretly wanted when the wedding service ended was for her to flatten out underneath his feet like Mrs. Willard\'s kitchen mat.","So you will rot in the ground, and so you say, what the hell?

You felt no reality, no knife of sorrow cut your intestines to bits. Only a weariness, a longing for a shoulder to sleep on, a pair of arms to curl up in \u2013 and a lack of that now.

Excerpts\u201d","Perch\xe8 mi sento libera di scriverle [le parole]?

It was like observing a Martian, or a particularly warty toad. Her thoughts were not my thoughts, nor her feelings my feelings, but we were close enough so that her thoughts and feelings seemed a wry, black image of my own.","I had never been to Chicago, but I knew one or two boys who went to Chicago University, and it seemed the sort of place where unconventional, mixed-up people would come from.","Ho talmente riempito la mia riserva di giorni e maschere che adesso posso e devo passare gli anni a pescare, a tirar su mostri dagli occhi di perla, coriacei, squamosi e con barbe marine, sommersi da lungo tempo nel mar dei Sargassi della mia immaginazione.","They want you to be in a special ward, my mother said. \u201cThey don\u2019t have that sort of ward at our hospital.\u201d\u201cI liked it where I was.\u201dMy mother\u2019s mouth tightened. \u201cYou should have behaved better, then.\u201d\u201cWhat?\u201d\u201cYou shouldn\u2019t have broken that mirror. Then maybe they\u2019d have let you stay.\u201dBut of course I knew the mirror had nothing to do with it\u201d","I liked looking on at other people in crucial situations. If there was a road accident or a street fight or a baby pickled in a laboratory jar for me to look at, I\u2019d stop and look so hard I never forgot it.","So these posed sheets, before they thin to nothing, Speak in sign language of a lost otherworld, A world we lose by merely waking up.","I get a little frightened when I think of life slipping through my fingers like water\u2014so fast that I have little time to stop running.","Girls like that make me sick. I\'m so jealous I can\'t speak.","The silence depressed me. It wasn\u2019t the silence of silence. It was my own silence. I knew perfectly well the cars were making a noise, and the people in them and behind the lit windows of the buildings were making a noise, and the river was making a noise, but I couldn\u2019t hear a thing. The city hung in my window, flat as a poster, glittering and blinking, but it might just as well not have been there at all, for the good it did me.","\xe8 come sollevara una campana di vetro posta sopra una comunit\xe0 dove tutto funziona come un meccanismo oliato, e vedere i minuscoli, indaffarati abitanti arrestarsi di colpo, boccheggiare, gonfiarsi e librarsi nell\'aflusso ( anzi, nel deflusso) della rarefatta atmosfera della norma: poveri esserini spaventati che agitano le braccia impotenti nell\'aria indecisa. \xe8 cos\xec che ci sente a liberarsi dalla routine.","These conversations I had in my mind usually repeated the beginnings of conversations I\u2019d really had with Buddy, only they finished with me answering him back quite sharply, instead of just sitting around and saying, \\"I guess so.","I thought it would be the way I\u2019d feel if I ever visited Europe.

A supposedly \\"enlightened\\" community. All he is is a pacifist. That, it seems, is a crime.)

Korea was never divided into \\"North\\" and \\"South.\\" They are one people; and our democracy is of no use to those who have not been educated to it.

They rot in the hospitals, and we forget them. I could love a Russian boy - and live with him. It\'s the living, the eating, the sleeping that everyone needs. Ideas don\'t matter so much after all. My three best friends are Catholic. I can\'t see their beliefs, but I can see the things they love to do on earth.

I felt sorry when I came to the last page. I wanted to crawl in between those black lines of print the way you crawl through a fence, and go to sleep under that beautiful big green fig tree.","Debe de haber unas cuantas cosas que un ba\xf1o caliente no puede curar, pero yo conozco muchas; siempre que estoy triste hasta morir, o tan nerviosa que no puedo dormir, o enamorada de alguien a quien no ver\xe9 en una semana, me deprimo, pero s\xf3lo hasta el punto en que me digo: \\"Tomar\xe9 un ba\xf1o caliente\\".

He grinned, \\"Don\'t be bitter; I\'m not. Come away from the sink, and watch.\\" He stepped back, drawing me toward him, slapping my stomach away, he kissed me long and sweetly. At last he let go. \\"There,\\" he said with a quiet smile. \\"The truth doesn\'t always hurt, does it?\\" And so we left. It was pouring rain. In the car he put his arm around me, his head against mine, and we watched the streetlights coming at us, blurred and fluid in the watery dark. As we ran up the walk in the rain, as he came in and had a drink of water, as he kissed me goodnight, I knew that something in me wanted him, for what I\'m not sure: He drinks, he smokes, he\'s Catholic, he runs around with one girl after another, and yet... I wanted him. \\"I don\'t have to tell you it\'s been nice,\\" I said at the door. \\"It\'s been marvelous,\\" he smiled. \\"I\'ll call you. Take care.\\" And he was gone. So the rain comes down hard outside my room, and like Eddie Cohen,\\" I say, \\"... fifteen thousand years - - - of what? We\'re still nothing but animals.\\" Somewhere, in his room, Emile lies, about to sleep, listening to the rain.

They\'re really going to mash the world up this time, the damn fools. When I read that description of the victims of Nagasaki I was sick: \\"And we saw what first looked like lizards crawling up the hill, croaking. It got lighter and we could see that it was humans, their skin burned off, and their bodies broken where they had been thrown against something.\\" Sounds like something out of a horror story. God save us from doing that again. For the United States did that. Our guilt. My country. No, never again. And then one reads in the papers \\"Second bomb blast in Nevada bigger than the first! \\" What obsession do men have for destruction and murder? Why do we electrocute men for murdering an individual and then pin a purple heart on them for mass slaughter of someone arbitrarily labeled \\"enemy?\\" Weren\'t the Russians communists when they helped us slap down the Germans? And now. What could we do with the Russian nation if we bombed it to bits? How could we \\"rule\\" such a mass of foreign people - - - we, who don\'t even speak the Russian language? How could we control them under our \\"democratic\\" system, we, who even now are losing that precious commodity, freedom of speech? (Mr. Crockett,\\" that dear man, was questioned by the town board. A supposedly \\"enlightened\\" community. All he is is a pacifist. That, it seems, is a crime.) Why do we send the pride of our young men overseas to be massacred for three dirty miles of nothing but earth? Korea was never divided into \\"North\\" and \\"South.\\" They are one people; and our democracy is of no use to those who have not been educated to it. Freedom is not of use to those who do not know how to employ it. When I think of that little girl on the farm talking about her brother - \\"And he said all they can think of over there is killing those God-damn Koreans.\\" What does she know of war? Of lizard-like humans crawling up a hillside? All she knows is movies and school room gossip. Oh, America\'s young, strong. So is Russia. And how they can think of atom-bombing each other, I don\'t know. What will be left? War will come some day now, with all the hothead leaders and articles \\"What If Women are Drafted?\\" Hell, I\'d sooner be a citizen of Africa than see America mashed and bloody and making a fool of herself. This country has a lot, but we\'re not always right and pure. And what of the veterans of the first and second world wars? The maimed, the crippled. What good their lives? Nothing. They rot in the hospitals, and we forget them. I could love a Russian boy - and live with him. It\'s the living, the eating, the sleeping that everyone needs. Ideas don\'t matter so much after all. My three best friends are Catholic. I can\'t see their beliefs, but I can see the things they love to do on earth. When you come right down to it, I do believe in the freedom of the individual - but to kill off all the ones who could forge a strong nation? How foolish! Of what good - living and freedom without home, without family, without all that makes life?","\u10d7\u10e3 \u10dd\u10e0\u10d8 \u10e3\u10e0\u10d7\u10d8\u10d4\u10e0\u10d7\u10d2\u10d0\u10db\u10dd\u10db\u10e0\u10d8\u10ea\u10ee\u10d0\u10d5\u10d8 \u10e0\u10d0\u10db\u10d8\u10e1 \u10d4\u10e0\u10d7\u10d3\u10e0\u10dd\u10e3\u10da\u10d0\u10d3 \u10dc\u10d3\u10dd\u10db\u10d0 \u10d8\u10e1\u10e2\u10d4\u10e0\u10d8\u10d0\u10d0, \u10db\u10d0\u10e8\u10d8\u10dc \u10e9\u10d4\u10db\u10d6\u10d4 \u10d8\u10e1\u10e2\u10d4\u10e0\u10d8\u10e3\u10da\u10d8 \u10d0\u10e0\u10d0\u10d5\u10d8\u10dc \u10d0\u10e0\u10e1\u10d4\u10d1\u10dd\u10d1\u10e1. \u10db\u10d7\u10d4\u10da\u10d8 \u10d3\u10d0\u10e0\u10e9\u10d4\u10dc\u10d8\u10da\u10d8 \u10ea\u10ee\u10dd\u10d5\u10e0\u10d4\u10d1\u10d0 \u10dd\u10e0 \u10d4\u10e0\u10d7\u10db\u10d0\u10dc\u10d4\u10d7\u10d8\u10e1 \u10d2\u10d0\u10db\u10dd\u10db\u10e0\u10d8\u10ea\u10ee\u10d0\u10d5 \u10d0\u10d3\u10d2\u10d8\u10da\u10e1 \u10e8\u10dd\u10e0\u10d8\u10e1 \u10d5\u10d8\u10e4\u10e0\u10d4\u10dc.","Your shelled bed I rememberFather, this thick air is murderousI would breathe water","I feel, in my singular passions and furies, that I become a gargoyle, and that people will point.

But still the face was there.","Durumun ne kadar umutsuzsa, seni o kadar uza\u011fa saklamaya \xe7al\u0131\u015f\u0131rlar.","A man doesn\u2019t have a worry in the world, while I\u2019ve got a baby hanging over my head like a big stick, to keep me in line.","Dusk hoods me in blue now, like a Mary.O colour of distance and forgetfulness!","And I said I wanted to live in the country and in the city both?","Me sent\xeda muy quieta y muy vac\xeda, como el ojo de un hurac\xe1n, avanzando a duras penas en medio de la vor\xe1gine.","It is the exception that interests the devil.","Pazar - doktorlar\u0131n cenneti! Doktorlar \xf6zel kul\xfcplerde, doktorlar deniz k\u0131y\u0131s\u0131nda, doktorlar metresleriyle birlikte, doktorlar kar\u0131lar\u0131yla birlikte, doktorlar kilisede, doktorlar yatlar\u0131nda, doktorlar her yerde, kesinlikle doktor de\u011fil, bug\xfcn yaln\u0131zca insan.","Ent\xe3o me perguntei se, assim que ele come\xe7asse a gostar de mim, ele n\xe3o se transformaria num sujeito comum aos meus olhos, e se quando come\xe7asse a me amar eu n\xe3o acharia defeito atr\xe1s de defeito nele, do jeito que fiz com Buddy Willard e os outros garotos. Era sempre a mesma coisa: eu vislumbrava um homem sem defeitos \xe0 dist\xe2ncia, mas assim que ele se aproximava eu percebia que n\xe3o era bem assim. Essa \xe9 uma das raz\xf5es por que nunca quis me casar. A \xfaltima coisa que eu queria da vida era \u201cseguran\xe7a infinita ou ser o \u201clugar de onde a flecha parte\u201d. Eu queria mudan\xe7a e agita\xe7\xe3o,queria ser uma flecha avan\xe7ando em todas as dire\xe7\xf5es, como as luzes coloridas de um roj\xe3ode Quatro de Julho.\u201d","This is no time for the private point of view. (from \'Candles\')","Sabato mattina, 13 dicembre. E allora impara a vivere. Tagliati una bella porzione di torta con le posate d\'argento. Impara come fanno le foglie a crescere sugli alberi. Apri gli occhi. [...] Impara come fa la luna a tramontare nel gelo della notte prima di Natale. Apri le narici. Annusa la neve. Lascia che la vita accada.","Gee baby, you are rare.","The beer tastes good to my throat, cold and bitter, and the three boys and the beer and the queer freeness of the situation make me feel like laughing forever. So I laugh, and my lipstick leaves a red stain like a bloody crescent moon on the top of the beer can. I am looking very healthy and flushed and bright eyed, having both a good tan and a rather excellent fever.","I remember Liz, her face white, delicate as an ash on the wind; her red lips staining the cigarette; her full breasts under the taut black jersey. She said to me, \\"But think how happy you can make a man someday.\\" Yes, I\'m thinking, and so far it\'s all right. But then I do a flipover and reach out in my mind to E., seeing a baseball game, maybe, perhaps watching television, or roaring with careless laughter at some dirty joke with the boys, beer cans lying about green and shiny gold, and ash trays. I spiral back to me, sitting here, swimming, drowning, sick with longing. I have too much conscience injected in me to break customs without disasterous effects; I can only lean enviously against the boundary and hate, hate, hate the boys who can dispel sexual hunger freely, without misgiving, and be whole, while I drag out from date to date in soggy desire, always unfulfilled. The whole thing sickens me.","Me sent\xeda deprimida. Hab\xeda sido desenmascarada esa misma ma\xf1ana por la propia Jota Ce y sent\xeda ahora que todas las inc\xf3modas sospechas que ten\xeda sobre m\xed misma se confirmaban y que no podr\xeda ocultar la verdad por mucho m\xe1s tiempo. Al cabo de diecinueve a\xf1os de correr tras buenas calificaciones y premios y becas de una u otra clase, estaba abandonando, disminuyendo la velocidad, sali\xe9ndome abiertamente de la carrera."]')}}]);
