Don\'t touch my chains.","The right understanding of any matter and a misunderstanding of the same matter do not wholly exclude each other.","Beyond a certain point there is no return. This point has to be reached.","You are so vulnerably haunting. Your eeriness is terrifyingly irresistible.","They\'re talking about things of which they don\'t have the slightest understanding, anyway.

One of the ways in which this hiddenness can express itself is through faith in a personal god.","Maybe innocence makes its way easiest through the elemental chaos of this world.","One day, a leopard stalked into the synagogue, roaring and lashing its tail. Three weeks later, it had become part of the liturgy.","I am a retiring, silent, unsociable, and discontent person.","For words are magical formulae.

It is there, though, not hostile, not reluctant, not deaf. If you summon it by the right word, by its right name, it will come.","My grandfather used to say: Life is astoundingly short. To me, looking back over it, life seems so foreshortened that I scarcely understand, for instance, how a young man can decide to ride over to the next village without being afraid that -not to mention accidents- even the span of a normal happy life may fall far short of the time needed for such a journey.","Tyranny or slavery, born of selfishness, are the two educational methods of parents; all gradations of tyranny or slavery.","May I kiss you then?

It must catch fire if you want to go further.","Test yourself on mankind. It is something that makes the doubter doubt, the believer believe.","By imposing too great a responsibility, or rather, all responsibility, on yourself, you crush yourself.","Faith, like a guillotine. As heavy, as light.","Each of us has his own way of emerging from the underworld, mine is by writing. That\'s why the only way I can keep going, if at all, is by writing, not through rest and sleep.

If one could but realize this knowledge, if one could but bring it into the light of day, if we dogs would but own that we know infinitely more than we admit to ourselves!","There are two main human sins from which all the others derive: impatience and indolence.

Because of impatience they were expelled, because of impatience they do not return.","Now I can look at you in peace; I don\'t eat you any more.","When one has once accepted and absorbed Evil, it no longer demands the unfitness of the means. The ulterior motives with which youabsorb and assimilate Evil are not your own but those of Evil.... Evil is whatever distracts. Evil knows of the Good, but Good does not know of Evil.

One cannot pay Evil in installments--and one always keeps on trying to.","I\'m thinking only of my illness and my health, though both, the first as well as the second, are you.","We are sinful not only because we have eaten of the Tree of Knowledge, but also because we have not yet eaten of the Tree of Life.

There is no such thing as observation of the inner world, as there is of the outer world.","Logic may indeed be unshakeable, but it cannot withstand a man who is determined to live.","Torment yourself as little as possible, then you\'ll torment me less.","Everything you say is boring and incomprehensible, but that alone doesn\'t make it true.","Love has as few problems as a motor car. The only problems are the driver, the passengers, and the road.","There\'s no quiet place here on earth for our love, not in the village and not anywhere else, so I picture a grave, deep and narrow, in which we embrace as if clamped together, I bury my face against you, you yours against me, and no one will ever see us.","What I write is different from what I say, what I say is different from what I think, what I think is different from what I ought to think and so it goes further into the deepest darkness.","The true way goes over a rope which is not stretched at any great height but just above the ground. It seems more designed to make people stumble than to be walked upon.","I am away from home and must always write home, even if any home of mine has long since floated away into eternity.","The whole visible world is perhaps nothing other than a motivation of man\'s wish to rest for a moment an attempt to falsify the fact of knowledge, to try to turn the knowledge into the goal.","Religions get lost as people do.","Written kisses don\'t reach their destination, rather they are drunk on the way by the ghosts.","No sooner said than done - so acts your man of worth.","Association with human beings lures one into self-observation.","One must not cheat anyone, not even the world of its victory.","One of the most effective means of seduction that Evil has is the challenge to struggle.

The way children would, they all wanted to be couriers. Therefore there are only couriers who hurry about the world, shouting to each other - since there are no kings - messages that have become meaningless.

That is why the revolutionary spiritual movements that declare all former things worthless are in the right, for nothing has yet happened.","To write prescriptions is easy, but to come to an understanding with people is hard.","Let me remind you of the old maxim: people under suspicion are better moving than at rest, since at rest they may be sitting in the balance without knowing it, being weighed together with their sins.","Writing sustains me. But wouldn\u2019t it be better to say it sustains this kind of life? Which doesn\'t mean life is any better when I don\u2019t write. On the contrary, it is far worse, wholly unbearable, and inevitably ends in madness.

I don\'t even have anything in common with myself.","German is my mother tongue and as such more natural to me, but I consider Czech much more affectionate, which is why your letter removes several uncertainties; I see you more clearly, the movements of your body, your hands, so quick, so resolute, it\u2019s almost like a meeting.","We need the books that affect us like a disaster","Idleness is the beginning of all vice, the crown of all virtues.","Writing is a deeper sleep than death. Just as one wouldn\'t pull a corpse from its grave, I can\'t be dragged from my desk at night.","I believe that we should read only those books that bite and sting us. If a book we are reading does not rouse us with a blow to the head, then why read it?","The dream reveals the reality which conception lags behind. That is the horror of life-the terror of art.","Someone must have slandered Josef K., for one morning, without having done anything truly wrong, he was arrested.","Writing is a sweet, wonderful reward.","I see, these books are probably law books, and it is an essential part of the justice dispensed here that you should be condemned not only in innocence but also in ignorance.","I think we ought to read only the kind of books that wound and stab us.","But what if all the tranquility, all the comfort, all the contentment were now to come to a horrifying end?","A book must be the ax for the frozen sea within us.","He was a tool of the boss, without brains or backbone.","Everything is deception: seeking the minimum of illusion, keeping within the ordinary limitations, seeking the maximum.

It isa husk, but not more than everything except the One.","In a certain sense you deny the existence of this world.

Since I am nothing but literature and can and want to be nothing else, my job will never take possession of me, it may, however, shatter me completely, and this is by no means a remote possibility.","This inescapable duty to observe oneself: if someone else is observing me, naturally I have to observe myself too; if none observe me, I have to observe myself all the closer.","Two possibilities: making oneself infinitely small or being so. The second is perfection, that is to say, inactivity, the first is beginning, that is to say, action.","I can prove at any time that my education tried to make another person out of me than the one I became. It is for the harm, therefore, that my educators could have done me in accordance with their intentions that I reproach them; I demand from their hands the person I now am, and since they cannot give him to me, I make of my reproach and laughter a drumbeat sounding in the world beyond.","One of the first signs of the beginning of understanding is the wish to die. This life appears unbearable, another unattainable. One is no longer ashamed of wanting to die; one asks to be moved from the old cell, which one hates, to a new one, which one willl only in time come to hate. In this there is also a residue of belief that during the move the master will chance to come along the corridor, look at the prisoner and say: \\"This man is not to be locked up again, He is to come with me.","I made the remark that I don\'t avoid people in order to live quietly, but rather in order to be able to die quietly.","The door could not be heard slamming; they had probably left it open, as is the custom in homes where a great misfortune has occurred.","There are two cardinal human sins out of which all others derive, deviate, and dissipate: impatience and lassitude (or perhaps nonchalance). On account of impatience they are driven out of paradise; on account of lassitude or nonchalance they do not return. Perhaps, however, only one main sense of sin is given: impatience. On account of impatience they are driven out, on account of impatience they do not turn back.","We photograph things in order to drive them out of our minds. My stories are a way of shutting my eyes.","Always first draw fresh breath after outbursts of vanity and complacency.","In argument similes are like songs in love; they describe much, but prove nothing.","and in that recurring dream, I found myself trapped in some sort of gigantic game of which I was unfamiliar with the rules; lost in a labyrinthine town of dark and damp, criss-crossing streets, ambiguous characters of uncertain authority having no idea of why I was there nor what I had to do, and where the first sign of the beginning of understanding was the wish to die.","This perversion of the truth, familiar to the artist though it was, always unnerved him afresh and proved too much for him. What was a consequence of the premature ending of his fast was here presented as the cause of it! To fight against this lack of understanding, against a whole world of nonunderstanding, was impossible.","Two tasks at the beginning of your life: to narrow your orbit more and more, and ever and again to check whether you are not in hiding somewhere outside your orbit.","How can one take delight in the world unless one flees to it for refuge?","Productivity is being able to do things that you were never able to do before.","Alas,\\" said the mouse, \\"the whole world is growing smaller every day. At the beginning it was so big that I was afraid, I kept running and running, and I was glad when I saw walls far away to the right and left, but these long walls have narrowed so quickly that I am in the last chamber already, and there in the corner stands the trap that I must run into.\\" \\"You only need to change your direction,\\" said the cat, and ate it up.","The history of the world, as it is written and handed down by word of mouth, often fails us completely; but man\'s intuitive capacity, though it often misleads, does lead, does not ever abandon one.","I am too tired, I must try to rest and sleep, otherwise I am lost in every respect. What an effort to keep alive! Erecting a monument does not require an expenditure of so much strength.","But eternity is not temporality at a standstill. What is oppressive about the concept of the eternal is the justification, incomprehensible to us, that time must undergo in eternity and the logical conclusion of that, the justification of ourselves as we are.","They did not know what we can now guess at, contemplating the course of history: that change begins in the soul before it appears in ordinary existence.","One has just been sent out as a biblical dove, has found nothing green, and slips back into the darkness of the Ark","The worries that are the burden of which the privileged person makes an excuse in dealing with the oppressed person are in fact the worries about preserving his privileged condition.","Death confronts us not unlike the historical battle scene that hangs on the wall of the classroom. It is our task to obscure or quite obliterate the picture by our deeds while we are still in this world.","The delights of this life are not its own, but our fear of the ascent into a higher life; the torments of this life are not its own, but our self-torment because of that fear.","Knowledge we have. Anyone who strives for it with particular intensity is suspect of striving against it.","Human judgment of human actions is true and void , that is to say, first true and then void.... The judgment of the word is true, the judgment in itself is void.... Only he who is a party can really judge, but as a party he cannot judge. Hence it follows that there is no possibility of judgment in the world, only a glimmer of it.","I can once more carry on a conversation with myself, and don\'t stare so into complete emptiness. Only in this way is there any possibility of improvement for me.","The Diabolical sometimes assumes the aspect of the Good, or even embodies itself completely in its form. If this remains concealedfrom me, I am of course defeated, for this Good is more tempting than the genuine Good.","Hiding places there are innumerable, escape is only one, but possibilities of escape, again, are as many as hiding places.","It is comforting to reflect that the disproportion of things in the world seems to be only arithmetical.","Some deny the existence of misery by pointing to the sun; he denies the existence of the sun by pointing to misery.","If the book we are reading does not wake us, as with a fist hammering on our skull, why then do we read? So that it shall make us happy? Good God, we should also be happy if we had no books, and such books as make us happy we could, if need be, write ourselves. But what we must have are those books which come upon us like ill fortune, and distress us deeply, like the death of one we love better than ourselves; like suicide. A book must be an ice-axe to break the sea frozen inside us.","Humility provides everyone, even him who despairs in solitude, with the strongest relationship to his fellow man.","The old incapacity. Interrupted my writing for barely ten days and already cast out. Once again prodigious efforts stand before me. You have to dive down, as it were, and sink more rapidly than that which sinks in advance of you.","A picture of my existence... would show a useless wooden stake covered in snow... stuck loosely at a slant in the ground in a ploughed field on the edge of a vast open plain on a dark winter night.","Utterance does not in principle mean a weakening of conviction--that would not be anything to be deplored--but a weakness of conviction.","Only our concept of time makes it possible for us to speak of the Day of Judgment by that name in reality it is a summary court in perpetual session.","Our art is a way of being dazzled by truth: the light on the grotesquely grimacing retreating face is true, and nothing else.","One tells as few lies as possible only by telling as few lies as possible, and not by having the least possible opportunity to do so.","It receives you when you come and dismisses you when you go.","As Gregor Samsa awoke one morning from uneasy dreams he found himself transformed in his bed into a gigantic insect.","It would have been so pointless to kill himself that, even if he had wanted to, the pointlessness would have made him unable.","One advantage in keeping a diary is that you become aware with reassuring clarity of the changes which you constantly suffer.","You\'re not cross with me, though?\\" he said. She pulled her hand away and answered, \\"No, no, I\'m never cross with anyone.","\\"Don\'t you want to join us?\\" I was recently asked by an acquaintance when he ran across me alone after midnight in a coffeehouse that was already almost deserted. \\"No, I don\'t,\\" I said.","But Gregor understood easily that it was not only consideration for him which prevented their moving, for he could easily have been transported in a suitable crate with a few air holes; what mainly prevented the family from moving was their complete hopelessness and the thought that they had been struck by a misfortune as none of their relatives and acquaintances had ever been hit.","For we are like tree trunks in the snow. In appearance they lie smoothly and a little push should be enough to set them rolling. No, it can\'t be done, for they are firmly wedded to the ground. But see, even that is only appearance.","True undoubting is the teacher\'s part, continual undoubting the part of the pupil.","One can disintegrate the world by means of very strong light. For weak eyes the world becomes solid, for still weaker eyes it seems to develop fists, for eyes weaker still it becomes shamefaced and smashes anyone who dares to gaze upon it.","When K. looked at the castle, often it seemed to him as if he were observing someone who sat quietly there in front of him gazing, not lost in thought and so oblivious of everything, but free and untroubled, as if he were alone with nobody to observe him, and yet must notice that he was observed, and all the same remained with his calm not even slightly disturbed; and really - one did not know whether it was cause or effect - the gaze of the observer could not remain concentrated there, but slid away.","For everything outside the phenomenal world, language can only be used allusively, but never even approximately in a comparative way, since, corresponding as it does to the phenomenal world, it is concerned only with property and its relations.","The fact that there is nothing but a spiritual world deprives us of hope and gives us certainty.","People who walk across dark bridges, past saints, with dim, small lights. Clouds which move across gray skies past churches with towers darkened in the dusk. One who leans against granite railing gazing into the evening waters, His hands resting on old stones.","People keep themselves at a tolerable height above an infernal abyss toward which they gravitate only by putting out all their strength and lovingly helping one another. They are tied together by ropes, and it\'s bad enough when the ropes around an individual loosen and he drops somewhat lower than the others into empty space; ghastly when the ropes break and he falls. That\'s why we should cling to the others.","there is nothing bad to fear; once you have crossed that threshold, all is well. Another world, and you do not have to speak","That\'s how it will be, except that in reality, both today and later, one will stand there with a palpable body and a real head, a real forehead, that is, for smiting on with one\'s hand.","Like tired dogs they stand there, because they use up all their strength in remaining upright in one\'s memory.","In one and the same human being there are cognitions that, however utterly dissimilar they are, yet have one and the same object,so that one can only conclude that there are different subjects in one and the same human being.","The whole visible world is perhaps nothing more than the rationalization of a man who wants to find peace for a moment.","A book should serve as an axe to the ice inside us.","Evil is the radiation of the human consciousness in certain transitional positions. It is not actually the sensual world that is amere appearance; what is so is the evil of it, which, admittedly, is what constitutes the sensual world in our eyes.","Every one of us has a bad conscience, which he tries to escape by going to sleep as quickly as possible.","I stand on the end platform of the tram and am completely unsure of my footing in this world, in this town, in my family. Not even casually could I indicate any claims that I might rightly advance in any direction. I have not even any defense to offer for standing on this platform, holding on to this strap, letting myself be carried along by this tram, nor for the people who give way to the tram or walk quietly along or stand gazing into shop windows. Nobody asks me to put up a defense, indeed, but that is irrelevant.","Every word first looks around in every direction before letting itself be written down by me.","He is a free and secure citizen of the world because he is on a chain that is long enough to allow him access to all parts of the earth, and yet not so long that he could be swept over the edge of it.","The existence of the writer is an argument against the existence of the soul, for the soul has obviously taken flight from the real ego, but not improved itself, only become a writer.","Nervous states of the worst sort control me without pause. Everything that is not literature bores me and I hate it. I lack all aptitude for family life except, at best, as an observer. I have no family feeling and visitors make me almost feel as though I were maliciously being attacked.","This noble body, equipped with everything necessary, almost to the point of bursting, also appeared to carry freedom around with it.","I won\'t give up the diary again. I must hold on here, it is the only place I can.","My life was sweeter than other people\'s and my death will be more terrible by the same degree.","Why do we complain about the Fall? It is not on its account that we were expelled from Paradise, but on account of the Tree of Life, lest we might eat of it.","You, who can\'t do anything, think you can bring off something like that? How can you even dare to think about it? If you were capable of it, you certainly wouldn\'t be in need of it.","There was once a community of scoundrels, that is to say, they were not scoundrels, but ordinary people.","From the true antagonist illimitable courage is transmitted to you.","Woman, or more precisely put, perhaps, marriage, is the representative of life with which you are meant to come to terms.","The nonexistent is whatever we have not sufficiently desired. Only after death, only in solitude, does a man\u2019s true nature emerge. In death, as on the chimney sweep\u2019s Saturday night, the soot gets washed from his body.","The Expulsion from Paradise is eternal in its principal aspect: this makes it irrevocable, and our living in this world inevitable, but the eternal nature of the process has the effect that not only could we remain forever in Paradise, but that we are currently there, whether we know it or not.","His biggest misgiving came from his concern about the loud crash that was bound to occur and would probably create, if not terror, at least anxiety behind all the doors. But that would have to be risked.","There can be knowledge of the diabolical, but no belief in it, for more of the diabolical than there is does not exist.","Writer speaks a stench.","In the struggle between yourself and the world second the world.","What is meant by its nature for the highest and the best, spreads among the lowly people.","The relationship to one\'s fellow man is the relationship of prayer, the relationship to oneself is the relationship of striving; it is from prayer that one draws the strength for one\'s striving.","We were created in order to live in Paradise, and Paradise was ordained to serve us.\\n What was ordained for us has been changed; it is not said\\n that this has also happened with what was ordained for Paradise.","The man in ecstasy and the man drowning - both throw up their arms. The first to signify harmony, the second to signify strife with the elements.","There is a down-and-outness under true knowledge and a childlike happy arising from it.","You too have weapons.","Anyone who believes cannot experience miracles. By day one does not see any stars. Anyone who does miracles says: I cannot let goof the earth.","I like to make use of what I know","I passed by the brothel as though \\npast the house of a beloved.","The mediation by the serpent was necessary. Evil can seduce man, but cannot become man.","We all have wings, but they have not been of any avail to us and if we could tear them off, we would do so.","I, however, cannot force myself to use \\"meat drugs\\" to cheat on my loneliness.","In a certain sense the Good is comfortless.","You see, I have only such a fugitive awareness of things around me that I always feel they were once real and are now fleeting away.","The crows maintain that a single crow could destroy the heavens. There is no doubt of that, but it proves nothing against the heavens, for heaven simply means: the impossibility of crows.","The Messiah will come only when he is no longer necessary, he will come only one day after his arrival, he will not come on the last day, but on the last day of all.","One morning, as Gregor Samsa was waking up from anxious dreams, he discovered that in his bed he had been changed into a monstrous bug.","The ulterior motives with which you absorb and assimilate Evil are not your own but those of Evil.","The founder brought the laws from the lawgiver; the faithful are meant to announce the laws to the lawgiver.","Celibacy and suicide are a similar levels of understanding, suicide and a martyr\'s death not so by any means, perhaps marriage and a martyr\'s death.","Art flies around truth, but with the definite intention of not getting burnt. Its capacity lies in finding in the dark void a place where the beam of light can be intensely caught, without this having been perceptible before.","it is not necessary to accept everything as true, one must only accept it as necessary.\' \'A melancholy conclusion,\' said K. \'It turns lying into a universal principle.","Work as joy, inaccessible to the psychologists.","What is gayer than believing in a household god?","The notion of the infinite expanse and copiousness of the cosmos is the result of the mixture, carried to the extreme limit, of laborious creation and free self-determination.","It\'s sometimes quite astonishing that a single, average life is enough to encompass so much that it\'s at all possible ever to have any success in one\'s work here.","I hate everything that does not relate to literature, conversations bore me (even if they relate to literature), to visit people bores me, the sorrows and joys of my relatives bore me to the very soul. Conversation takes the importance, the seriousness, the truth, out of everything I think.","Martyrs do not underrate the body, they allow it to be elevated on the cross. In this they are at one with their antagonists.","I don\'t know who the great lawyers are, and I presume you can\'t get to them. I know of no case where it can be said for certain that they took part. They defend some people, but you can\'t get them to do that through your own efforts, they only defend the ones they want to defend. But I assume a case they take on must have progressed beyond the lower court. It\'s better not to think of them at all, otherwise you\'ll find the consultations with the other lawyers, their advice and their assistance, extremely disgusting and useless.","If I didn\'t have my parents to think about I\'d have given in my notice a long time ago, I\'d have gone up to the boss and told him just what I think, tell him everything I would, let him know just what I feel. He\'d fall right off his desk! And it\'s a funny sort of business to be sitting up there at your desk, talking down at your subordinates from up there, especially when you have to go right up close because the boss is hard of hearing.","What a fate: to be condemned to work for a firm where the slightest negligence at once gave rise to the gravest suspicion! Were all the employees nothing but a bunch of scoundrels, was there not among them one single loyal devoted man who, had he wasted only an hour or so of the firm\'s time in the morning, was so tormented by conscience as to be driven out of his mind and actually incapable of leaving his bed?","Going to pieces. To go to pieces so pointlessly and unnecessarily.","From the true antagonist illimitable courage is transmitted to you.\\nTo what indifference people may come, to what profound conviction of having lost the right track forever.","Ours is a lost generation, it may be, but it is more blameless than those earlier generations.","Time is short, my strength is limited, the office is a horror, the apartment is noisy, and if a pleasant, straightforward life is not possible, then one must try to wriggle through by subtle manoeuvres.","The ulterior motives with which you absorb and assimilate Evil are not your own but those of Evil. \\n The animal wrests the whip from its master and whips itself in order to become master, not knowing that this is only a fantasy produced by a new knot in the master\'s whiplash.","The observer of the soul cannot penetrate into the soul, but there doubtless is a margin where he comes into contact with it. Recognition of this contact is the fact that even the soul does not know of itself. Hence it must remain unknown. That would be sad only if there were anything apart from the soul, but there is nothing else.","My doubts stand in a circle around every word, I see them before I see the word, but what then! I do not see the word at all, I invent it.","But questions that don\u2019t answer themselves at the very moment of their asking are never answered.","Anyone who loves his neighbor within the limits of the world is doing no more and no less injustice than someone who loves himself within the limits of the world.","There will be no proof that I ever was a writer.","To every instant there is a correspondence in something outside time. This world here and now cannot be followed by a Beyond, for the Beyond is eternal, hence it cannot be in temporal contact with this world here and now.","it was like this. the brain could no longer bear the worries and pains that were imposed on it. it said: \\"i\'m giving up; but if there is anyone else here who is interested in preserving the whole, let him assume part of my burden and it will be alright for a bit.","Palestine needs earth, but it does not need lawyers.","If there is a transmigration of souls then I am not yet on the bottom rung. My life is a hesitation before birth.","Sometimes I\'d like to stuff all Jews (myself included) into the drawer of a laundry basket. then open it to see if they\'ve suffocated","It would be very unjust to say that you deserted me, but that I was deserted, and sometimes terribly so, is true.","And so gentlemen, I learned. Oh, if you have to learn, you learn; if you\u2019re desperate for a way out, you learn; you learn pitilessly. You stand over yourself with a whip in your hand; if there\u2019s the least resistance, you lash yourself.","In theory there is a possibility of perfect happiness: To believe in the indestructible element within one, and not to strive towards it.","If this is what you came for, then I didn\'t send for you. Kafka (note to himself in journal)","Anyone who renounces the world must love all men, for he renounces their world too. He thus begins to have some inkling of the true nature of man, which cannot but be loved, always assuming that one is its peer.","The person I am in the company of my sisters has been entirely different from the person I am in the company of other people. Fearless, powerful, surprising, moved as I otherwise am only when I write.","If it had been possible to build the Tower of Babel without climbing it, it would have been permitted.","Was he an animal, that music could move him so? He felt as if the way to the unknown nourishment he longed for were coming to light.","Hold fast to the diary from today on! Write regularly! Don\'t surrender! Even if no salvation should come, I want to be worthy of it every moment.","It requires enormous presence of mind or rather quickness of wit, when opening your eyes to seize hold as it were of everything in the room at exactly the same place where you had let it go on the previous evening. That is why the moment of waking up was the riskiest moment of the day. Once that was well over without deflecting you from your orbit, you could take heart of grace for the rest of the day.","The more horses you yoke the quicker everything will go - not the rending of the block from its foundation, which is impossible, but the snapping of the traces and with that the gay and empty journey.","If they were shocked, then Gregor had no further responsibility and could be calm. But if they took everything calmly, he he, too, had no reason to get excited and could, if he hurried, actually be at the station by eight o\'clock.","He thought back on his family with deep emotion and love. His conviction that he would have to disappear was, if possible, even firmer than his sister\'s. He remained in this state of empty and peaceful reflection until the tower clock struck three in the morning. He still saw that outside the window everything was beginning to grow light. Then, without his consent, his head sank down to the floor, and from his nostrils streamed his last weak breath.","Everyone strives to attain the Law,\' answers the man, \'how does it come about, then, that in all these years no one has come seeking admittance but me?\' The doorkeeper perceives that the man is nearing his end and his hearing is failing, so he bellows in his ear: \'No one but you could gain admittance through this door, since this door was intended for you. I am now going to shut it.","Heaven is dumb, echoing only the dumb.","The true way goes over a line that, rather than spanning heights, is hardly above the ground. It appears more decidedly to make one trip than to be walked along.","Suffering is the positive element in this world, indeed it is the only link between this world and the positive.","We are separated from God on two sides; the Fall separates us from Him, the Tree of Life separates Him from us.","I am on the hunt for constructions. I come into a room and find them whitely merging in a corner.","It is only our conception of time that makes us call the Last Judgement by this name. It is, in fact, a kind of martial law.","Sensual love deceives one as to the nature of heavenly love; it could not do so alone, but since it unconsciously has the element of heavenly love within it, it can do so.","If what was supposed to have been destroyed in Paradise was destructible, then it was not decisive; but if it was indestructible, then we are living in a false belief.","There they lay, but not in the forgetfulness of the previous night. She was seeking and he was seeking, they raged and contorted their faces and bored their heads into each others bosom in the urgency of seeking something, and their embraces and their tossing limbs did not avail to make them forget, but only reminded them of what they sought","It is strange how little sharpsightedness women possess; they only notice whether they please, then whether they arouse pity, and finally, whether you look for compassion from them. That is all; come to think of it, it may even be enough, generally speaking.","A book must be the axe for the frozen sea within us.","Youth is happy because it has the capacity to see beauty. Anyone who keeps the ability to see beauty never grows old.","I think we ought to read only the kind of books that wound or stab us. If the book we\'re reading doesn\'t wake us up with a blow to the head, what are we reading for? So that it will make us happy, as you write? Good Lord, we would be happy precisely if we had no books, and the kind of books that make us happy are the kind we could write ourselves if we had to. But we need books that affect us like a disaster, that grieve us deeply, like the death of someone we loved more than ourselves, like being banished into forests far from everyone, like a suicide. A book must be the axe for the frozen sea within us. That is my belief.","A First Sign of the Beginning of Understanding is the Wish to Die.","A non-writing writer is a monster courting insanity.\\"[Letter to Max Brod, July 5, 1922]","By believing passionately in something that still does not exist, we create it. The nonexistent is whatever we have not sufficiently desired.","I have spent all my life resisting the desire to end it.","My peers, lately, have found companionship through means of intoxication--it makes them sociable. I, however, cannot force myself to use drugs to cheat on my loneliness--it is all that I have--and when the drugs and alcohol dissipate, will be all that my peers have as well.","L\'\xe9ternit\xe9, c\'est long ... surtout vers la fin.","Yours(now I\'m even losing my name - it was getting shorter and shorter all the time and is now: Yours)","We are as forlorn as children lost in the wood. When you stand in front of me and look at me, what do you know of the griefs that are in me and what do I know of yours? And if I were to cast myself down before you and tell you, what more would you know about me that you know about Hell when someone tells you it is hot and dreadful?","You are the knife I turn inside myself; that is love. That, my dear, is love.","How about if I sleep a little bit longer and forget all this nonsense\\",","You are free and that is why you are lost.","You are at once both the quiet and the confusion of my heart; imagine my heartbeat when you are in this state.","Do you know, darling? When you became involved with others you quite possibly stepped down a level or two, but If you become involved with me, you will be throwing yourself into the abyss.","I am dirty, Milena, endlessly dirty, that is why I make such a fuss about cleanliness. None sing as purely as those in deepest hell; it is their singing we take for the singing of angels.","The Kafka paradox: art depends on truth, but truth, being indivisable, cannot know itself: to tell the truth is to lie. thus the writer is the truth, and yet when he speaks he lies.","We are as forlorn as children lost in the woods. When you stand in front of me and look at me, what do you know of the griefs that are in me and what do I know of yours. And if I were to cast myself down before you and weep and tell you, what more would you know about me than you know about Hell when someone tells you it is hot and dreadful? For that reason alone we human beings ought to stand before one another as reverently, as reflectively, as lovingly, as we would before the entrance to Hell.","sleep is the most innocent creature there is and a sleepless manthe most guilty.","When one is alone, imperfection must be endured every minute of the day; a couple, however, does not have to put up with it. Aren\u2019t our eyes made to be torn out, and our hearts for the same purpose? At the same time it\u2019s really not that bad; that\u2019s an exaggeration and a lie, everything is exaggeration, the only truth is longing. But even the truth of longing is not so much its own truth; it\u2019s really an expression for everything else, which is a lie. This sounds crazy and distorted, but it\u2019s true. Moreover, perhaps it isn\u2019t love when I say you are what I love the most - you are the knife I turn inside myself, this is love. This, my dear, is love.","Anyone who keeps the ability to see beauty never grows old.","For myself I am too heavy, and for you too light.","It certainly was not my intention to make you suffer, yet i have done so; obviously it never will be my intention to make you suffer, yet I shall always do so.","I\u2019m doing badly, I\u2019m doing well, whichever you prefer.","Forget everything. Open the windows. Clear the room. The wind blows through it. You see only its emptiness, you search in every corner and don\u2019t find yourself.","Anyone who cannot cope with life while he is alive needs one hand to ward off a little his despair over his fate...but with his other hand he can jot down what he sees among the ruins, for he sees different and more things than the others; after all, he is dead in his own lifetime and the real survivor.","Even if no salvation should come, I want to be worthy of it at every moment.","Sometimes I have the feeling that we\'re in one room with two opposite doors and each of us holds the handle of one door, one of us flicks an eyelash and the other is already behind his door, and now the first one has but to utter a word ad immediately the second one has closed his door behind him and can no longer be seen. He\'s sure to open the door again for it\'s a room which perhaps one cannot leave. If only the first one were not precisely like the second, if he were calm, if he would only pretend not to look at the other, if he slowly set the room in order as though it were a room like any other; but instead he does exactly the same as the other at his door, sometimes even both are behind the doors and the the beautiful room is empty.","I\u2019m thinking only of my illness and my health, though both, the first as well as the second, are you.","Nothing unites two people so completely, especially if, like you and me, all they have is words.","If I could drown in sleep as I drown in fear I would be no longer alive.","The books we need are of the kind that act upon us like a misfortune, that makes us suffer like the death of someone we love more than ourselves, that make us feel as though we were on the verge of suicide, lost in a forest remote from all human habitation.","But I\u2019m not guilty, said K. \u201cthere\u2019s been a mistake. How is it even possible for someone to be guilty? We\u2019re all human beings here, one like the other.\u201d \u201cThat is true\u201d said the priest \u201cbut that is how the guilty speak\u201d","I long for you; I who usually longs without longing, as though I am unconscious and absorbed in neutrality and apathy, really, utterly long for every bit of you.","You misinterpret everything, even the silence.","I am not well; I could have built the Pyramids with the effort it takes me to cling on to life and reason.","But sleep? On a night like this? What an idea! Just think of how many thoughts a blanket smothers while one lies alone in bed, and how many unhappy dreams it keeps warm.","You must not pay too much attention to opinions. The written word is unalterable, and opinions are often only an expression of despair.","The sister played so beautifully. Her face was tilted to one side and she followed the notes with soulful and probing eyes. Gregor advanced a little, keeping his eyes low so that they might possibly meet hers.

Listen, in that case I could not write at all. For writing means revealing oneself to excess; that utmost of self-revelation and surrender, in which a human being, when involved with others, would feel he was losing himself, and from which, therefore, he will always shrink as long as he is in his right mind-- for everyone wants to live as long as he is alive-- even the degree of self-revelation and surrender is not enough for writing.Writing that springs from the surface of existence-- when there is no other way and deeper wells have dried up-- is nothing, and collapses the moment a truer emotion makes the surface shake. That is why one can never be alone enough when one writes, why there can never be enough silence around one when one writes, why even night is not night enough.","I only fear danger where I want to fear it.","One has either to take people as they are, or leave them as they are.

All these parables really set out to say merely that the incomprehensible is incomprehensible, and we know that already. But the cares we have to struggle with every day: that is a different matter.Concerning this a man once said: Why such reluctance?

To this doorkeeper there comes a man from the country who begs for admittance to the Law. But the doorkeeper says that he cannot admit the man at the moment. The man, on reflection, asks if he will be allowed, then, to enter later. \'It is possible,\' answers the doorkeeper, \'but not at this moment.\' Since the door leading into the Law stands open as usual and the doorkeeper steps to one side, the man bends down to peer through the entrance. When the doorkeeper sees that, he laughs and says: \'If you are so strongly tempted, try to get in without my permission. But note that I am powerful. And I am only the lowest doorkeeper. From hall to hall keepers stand at every door, one more powerful than the other. Even the third of these has an aspect that even I cannot bear to look at.\' These are difficulties which the man from the country has not expected to meet, the Law, he thinks, should be accessible to every man and at all times, but when he looks more closely at the doorkeeper in his furred robe, with his huge pointed nose and long, thin, Tartar beard, he decides that he had better wait until he gets permission to enter. The doorkeeper gives him a stool and lets him sit down at the side of the door. There he sits waiting for days and years. He makes many attempts to be allowed in and wearies the doorkeeper with his importunity. The doorkeeper often engages him in brief conversation, asking him about his home and about other matters, but the questions are put quite impersonally, as great men put questions, and always conclude with the statement that the man cannot be allowed to enter yet. The man, who has equipped himself with many things for his journey, parts with all he has, however valuable, in the hope of bribing the doorkeeper. The doorkeeper accepts it all, saying, however, as he takes each gift: \'I take this only to keep you from feeling that you have left something undone.\' During all these long years the man watches the doorkeeper almost incessantly. He forgets about the other doorkeepers, and this one seems to him the only barrier between himself and the Law. In the first years he curses his evil fate aloud; later, as he grows old, he only mutters to himself. He grows childish, and since in his prolonged watch he has learned to know even the fleas in the doorkeeper\'s fur collar, he begs the very fleas to help him and to persuade the doorkeeper to change his mind. Finally his eyes grow dim and he does not know whether the world is really darkening around him or whether his eyes are only deceiving him. But in the darkness he can now perceive a radiance that streams immortally from the door of the Law. Now his life is drawing to a close. Before he dies, all that he has experienced during the whole time of his sojourn condenses in his mind into one question, which he has never yet put to the doorkeeper. He beckons the doorkeeper, since he can no longer raise his stiffening body. The doorkeeper has to bend far down to hear him, for the difference in size between them has increased very much to the man\'s disadvantage. \'What do you want to know now?\' asks the doorkeeper, \'you are insatiable.\' \'Everyone strives to attain the Law,\' answers the man, \'how does it come about, then, that in all these years no one has come seeking admittance but me?\' The doorkeeper perceives that the man is at the end of his strength and that his hearing is failing, so he bellows in his ear: \'No one but you could gain admittance through this door, since this door was intended only for you. I am now going to shut it.","I\'m on such a dangerous road, Milena. You\'re standing firmly near a tree, young, beautiful, your eyes subduing with their radiance the suffering world.","Since I met you, I\'ve felt abandoned without your nearness; your nearness is all I ever dream of, the only thing.","Don\'t you want to join us?\\" I was recently asked by an acquaintance when he ran across me alone after midnight in a coffeehouse that was already almost deserted. \\"No, I don\'t,\\" I said.","You will get to know me better; there are still a number of horrible recesses in me that you don\u2019t know.","The fact that no one knows where I am is my only happiness.

Remain at your table and listen. Do not even listen, only wait. Do not even wait, be wholly still and alone. The world will present itself to you for its unmasking, it can do no other, in ecstasy it will writhe at your feet.","When I meet a pretty girl and beg her: \\"Be so good as to come with me,\\" and she walks past without a word, this is what she means to say:\\"You are no Duke with a famous name, no broad American with Red Indian figure, level, brooding eyes and a skin tempered by the air of the prairies and the rivers that flow through them, you have never journeyed to the seven seas and voyaged on them wherever they may be, I don\'t know where. So why, pray, should a pretty girl like myself go with you?\\"\\"You forget that no automobile swings you through the street in long thrusts; I see no gentlemen escorting you in a close half-circle, pressing on your skirts from behind and murmuring blessings on your head; your breasts are well laced into your bodice, but your thighs and hips make up for that restraint; you are wearing a taffeta dress with a pleated skirt such as delighted all of us last autumn, and yet you smile-inviting mortal danger-from time to time.\\"\\"Yes, we\'re both in the right, and to keep us from being irrevocably aware of it, hadn\'t we better just go our separate ways home?","You can withdraw from the sufferings of the world \u2014 that possibility is open to you and accords with your nature \u2014 but perhaps that withdrawal is the only suffering you might be able to avoid.","In general I lacked principally the ability to provide even in the slightest detail for the real future. I thought only of things in the present and their present condition, not because of thoroughness or any special, strong interest, but rather, to the extent that weakness in thinking was not the cause, because of sorrow and fear \u2013 sorrow, because the present was so sad for me that I thought I could not leave it before it resolved itself into happiness; fear, because, like my fear of the slightest action in the present, I also considered myself, in view of my contemptible, childish appearance, unworthy of forming a serious, responsible opinion of the great, manly future which usually seemed so impossible to me that every short step forward appeared to me to be counterfeit and the next step unattainable.","Nobody will read what I say here, no one will come to help me; even if all the people were commanded to help me, every door and window would remain shut, everybody would take to bed and draw the bed-clothes over his head, the whole earth would become an inn for the night. And there is sense in that, for nobody knows of me, and if anyone knew he would not know where I could be found, and if he knew where I could be found, he would not know how to deal with me, he would not know how to help me. The thought of helping me is an illness that has to be cured by taking to one\'s bed.(\\"The Hunter Gracchus\\")","His growing lack of concern for the others hardly surprised him, whereas previously he had prided himself on being considerate.","There are times when my longing for you overwhelms me [\u2026] so often I can think of you only with teeth clenched.","It seemed to K. as if at last those people had broken off all relations with him, and as if now in reality he were freer than he had ever been, and at liberty to wait here in this place usually forbidden to him as long as he desired, and had won a freedom such as hardly anybody else had ever succeeded in winning, and as if nobody could dare touch him or drive him away, or even speak to him, but \u2014 this conviction was at least equally as strong \u2014 as if at the same time there was nothing more senseless, more hopeless, than this freedom, this waiting, this inviolability.","Surveyor, in your thoughts you may be reproaching Sordini for not having been prompted by my claim to make inquiries about the matter in other departments. But that would have been wrong, and I want this man cleared of all blame in your thoughts. One of the operating principles of authorities is that the possibility of error is simply not taken into account. This principle is justified by the excellence of the entire organization and is also necessary if matters are to be discharged with the utmost rapidity. So Sordini couldn\u2019t inquire in other departments, besides those departments wouldn\u2019t have answered, since they would have noticed right away that he was investigating the possibility of an error. \u201cChairman, allow me to interrupt you with a question,\u201d said K., \u201cdidn\u2019t you mention a control agency? As you describe it, the organization is such that the very thought that the control agency might fail to materialize is enough to make one ill.\u201d \u201cYou\u2019re very severe,\u201d said the chairman, \u201cbut multiply your severity by a thousand and it will still be as nothing compared with the severity that the authorities show toward themselves. Only a total stranger could ask such a question. Are there control agencies? There are only control agencies. Of course they aren\u2019t meant to find errors, in the vulgar sense of that term, since no errors occur, and even if an error does occur, as in your case, who can finally say that it is an error.\u201d","Peaceful moon. I consist only of bones.","Logic is doubtless unshakable, but it cannot withstand a man who wants to go on living.","I read the letter once, put it aside, and read it again; I pick up a file but am really only reading your letter; I am with the typist, to whom I am supposed to dictate, and again your letter slowly slides through my fingers and I have begun to draw it out of my pocket when people ask me something and I know perfectly well I should not be thinking of your letter now, yet that thought is all that occurs to me\u2014but after all that I am as hungry as before, as restless as before, and once again the door starts swinging merrily, as though the man with the letter were about to appear again. That is what you call the \u201clittle pleasure your letters give me.\u201d","In front of the law there is a doorkeeper. A man from the countryside comes up to the door and asks for entry. But the doorkeeper says he can\'t let him in to the law right now. The man thinks about this, and then he asks if he\'ll be able to go in later on. \\"That\'s possible,\\" says the doorkeeper, \\"but not now\\". The gateway to the law is open as it always is, and the doorkeeper has stepped to one side, so the man bends over to try and see in. When the doorkeeper notices this he laughs and says, \\"If you\'re tempted give it a try, try and go in even though I say you can\'t. Careful though: I\'m powerful. And I\'m only the lowliest of all the doormen. But there\u2019s a doorkeeper for each of the rooms and each of them is more powerful than the last. It\'s more than I can stand just to look at the third one.","I have discovered your great wound.

Good God, we also would be happy if we had no books and such books that make us happy we could, if need be, write ourselves.

One of us started singing a ballad, but we all wanted to sing. We sang far quicker than the speed of the train, we swung our arms because our voices weren\'t enough, our voices got into a tangle where we felt happy. If you mix your voice with others\' voices, you feel as though you\'re caught on a hook. (trans.

It goes like this: One of the older officials, a good and peaceful man, was dealing with a difficult matter for the court which had become very confused, especially thanks to the contributions from the lawyers. He had been studying it for a day and a night without a break \u2014 as these officials are indeed hard working, no-one works as hard as they do. When it was nearly morning, and he had been working for twenty-four hours with probably very little result, he went to the front entrance, waited there in ambush, and every time a lawyer tried to enter the building he would throw him down the steps. The lawyers gathered together down in front of the steps and discussed with each other what they should do; on the one hand they had actually no right to be allowed into the building so that there was hardly anything that they could legally do to the official and, as I\'ve already mentioned, they would have to be careful not to set all the officials against them. On the other hand, any day not spent in court is a day lost for them and it was a matter of some importance to force their way inside. In the end, they agreed that they would try to tire the old man out. One lawyer after another was sent out to run up the steps and let himself be thrown down again, offering what resistance he could as long as it was passive resistance, and his colleagues would catch him at the bottom of the steps. That went on for about an hour until the old gentleman, who was already exhausted from working all night, was very tired and went back to his office.","The difficulties (which other people surely find incredible) I have in speaking to people arise from the fact that my thinking, or rather the content of my consciousness, is entirely nebulous, that I remain undisturbed by this, so far as it concerns only myself, and am even occasionally self-satisfied; yet conversation with people demands pointedness, solidity, and sustained coherence, qualities not to be found in me. No one will want to lie in clouds of mist with me, and even if someone did, I couldn\u2019t expel the mist from my head; when two people come together it dissolves of itself and is nothing.","He speaks to Klamm, but is it Klamm? Isn\u2019t it rather someone who merely resembles Klamm? Perhaps at the very most a secretary who is a little like Klamm and goes to great lengths to be even more like him and tries to seem important by affecting Klamm\u2019s drowsy, dreamlike manner. That part of his being is easiest to imitate, many try to do so; as for the rest of his being, though, they wisely steer clear of it. And a man such as Klamm, who is so often the object of yearning and yet so rarely attained, easily takes on a variety of shapes in the imagination of people. For instance, Klamm has a village secretary here called Momus. Really? You know him? He too keeps to himself but I have seen him a couple of times. A powerful young gentleman, isn\u2019t he? And so he probably doesn\u2019t look at all like Klamm? And yet you can find people in the village who would swear that Momus is Klamm and none other than he. That\u2019s how people create confusion for themselves. And why should it be any different at the Castle?","Wherever I turn, the black wave rushes down on me.","I can never tear myself open wide enough to people to reveal everything and so frighten them away.","But please, father, understand me correctly: these were completely insignificant details, yet they oppressed me, because you, a great man of authority, could lay down rules for me, and ignore them.\xa0 And through this I saw that the world was divided into three parts: in the first lived the slave, me, under laws invented solely for my life but to which, without understanding why, I could never fully adjust; and in the second part lived you, infinitely far from me, busy ruling, giving commands and being angry when they weren\u2019t followed; and in the third lived everybody else, happy and free from commands and obedience.\xa0 And I was constantly in disgrace, either because I followed your commands, and that was a disgrace, as they were valid only for me; or I was stubborn, and that was also a disgrace, because I was being stubborn to oppose you; or I wasn\u2019t able to obey, because I, for example, had not your strength, your appetite, your skill, to do whatever it was that for you seemed natural \u2013 and of all things this disgrace was the greatest.\xa0 But these aren\u2019t the reflections of childhood, but the feelings.

For when asleep and dreaming you are, apparently at least, in an essentially different state from that of wakefulness; and therefore, as that man truly said, it requires enormous presence of mind or rather quickness of wit, when opening your eyes to seize hold as it were of everything in the room at exactly the same place where you had let it go on the previous evening. That was why, he said, the moment of waking up was the riskiest moment of the day.

He gives battle to both. To be sure, the first supports him in his fight with the second, for he wants to push him forward, and in the same way the second supports him in his fight with the first, since he drives him back. But it is only theoretically so. For it is not only the two antagonists who are there, but he himself as well, and who really knows his intentions? His dream, though, is that some time in an unguarded moment and this would require a night darker than any night has ever been yet he will jump out of the fighting line and be promoted, on account of his experience in fighting, to the position of umpire over his antagonists in their fight with each other.","If you have food in your jaws you have solved all questions for the time being.","It is entirely conceivable that life\'s splendour forever lies in wait about each one of us in all its fullness, but veiled from our view, deep down, invisible, far off.

Then they came out, hesitantly, pushing one another, all drawn towards the scene of death. There it lay, the dear little mouse, its neck caught in the deadly iron, the little pink legs drawn up, and now stiff the feeble body that would so well have deserved a scrap of bacon.The parents stood beside it and eyed their child\'s remains.","Look at this, Willem, he admits he doesn\u2019t know the law and at the same time insists he\u2019s innocent.","bazen kar\u015f\u0131l\u0131kl\u0131 iki kap\u0131s\u0131 olan bir odam\u0131z varm\u0131\u015f gibi geliyor; ikimiz de kendi kap\u0131m\u0131z\u0131n kolunu tutuyoruz, birimiz g\xf6z\xfcn\xfc k\u0131rpsa, di\u011ferimiz kendi kap\u0131s\u0131n\u0131n ard\u0131na ka\xe7\u0131veriyor ve ilki tek bir s\xf6z s\xf6ylemeye kalksa ikincisi kesinlikle \xe7oktan kap\u0131y\u0131 arkas\u0131ndan kilitlemi\u015f ve g\xf6zden kaybolmu\u015f oluyor. kap\u0131y\u0131 tekrar a\xe7acak, \xe7\xfcnk\xfc bu belkide insan\u0131n terk edemedi\u011fi bir oda. ilki ikincisine bu kadar benzemese, sakin olsa, \xf6tekine bakm\u0131yormu\u015f gibi davransa, oday\u0131 sanki herhangi bir odaym\u0131\u015f gibi yava\u015f yava\u015f d\xfczene sokacak, ama bunun yerine, o da kap\u0131s\u0131n\u0131n orada ayn\u0131 \u015feyi yap\u0131yor, hatta bazen ikisi de kap\u0131lar\u0131n\u0131n arkas\u0131na saklan\u0131yorlar ve g\xfczelim oda bombo\u015f kal\u0131yor.i\u015fte bu y\xfczden, \xfcz\xfcc\xfc yanl\u0131\u015f anlamalar ortaya \xe7\u0131k\u0131yor...","Now I can look at you in peace; I don\u2019t eat you anymore.[while admiring fish in an aquarium]","Human nature, essentially changeable, unstable as the dust, can endure no restraint; if it binds itself it soon begins to tear madly at its bonds, until it renders everything asunder, the wall, and the bonds and its very self.","You can hold back from the suffering of the world, you have permission to do so, and it is in accordance with your nature.

Listen, in that case I could not write at all. For writing means revealing oneself to excess; that utmost of self-revelation and surrender, in which a human being, when involved with others, would feel he was losing himself, and from which, therefore, he will always shrink as long as he is in his right mind.

Your life is so very different, dearest. Except in relation to your fellow men, have you ever known uncertainty? Have you ever observed how, within yourself and independent of other people, diverse possibilities open up in several directions, thereby actually creating a ban on your every movement? Have you ever, without giving the slightest thought to anyone else, been in despair simply about yourself? Desperate enough to throw yourself on the ground and remain there beyond the Day of Judgment? How devout are you? You go to the synagogue; but I dare say you have not been recently. And what is it that sustains you, the idea of Judaism or of God? Are you aware, and this is the most important thing, of a continuous relationship between yourself and a reassuringly distant, if possibly infinite height or depth? He who feels this continuously has no need to roam about like a lost dog, mutely gazing around with imploring eyes; he never need yearn to slip into a grave as if it were a warm sleeping bag and life a cold winter night; and when climbing the stairs to his office he never need imagine that he is careering down the well of the staircase, flickering in the uncertain light, twisting from the speed of his fall, shaking his head with impatience. There are times, dearest, when I am convinced I am unfit for any human relationship.","The gesture of rejection with which I was forever met did not mean: \'I do not love you,\' but: \'You cannot love me, much as you would like; you are unhappily in love with your love for me, but your love for me is not in love with you.\' It is consequently incorrect to say that I have known the words, \'I love you\'; I have known only the expectant stillness that should have been broken by my \'I love you,\' that is all that I have known, nothing more.","Alone I continue living, yet when a visitor arrives it kills me.","What do I have in common with the Jews?

Others waver too, but in lower regions, with greater strength; if they are in danger of falling, they are caught up by the kinsman who walks beside them for that purpose. But I waver on the heights; it is not death, alas, but the eternal torments of dying.","One learns when one has to; one learns when one needs a way out; one learns at all costs.

Her face was leant to one side,following the lines of music with a careful and melancholyexpression. Gregor crawled a little further forward, keeping hishead close to the ground so that he could meet her eyes if thechance came.","I am forever chained to myself; that\u2019s what I am, and that\u2019s what I must try to live with.","All right then, I\u2019ll be mad at you on this score, which incidentally is no great misfortune, as things balance out quite well if there\u2019s a little anger for you lurking in one corner of my heart.","In a light that is fierce and strong one can see the world dissolve. To weak eyes it becomes solid, to weaker eyes it shows fists; before weaker eyes still it feels ashamed, and smites down whomsoever dares to look at it.","It is to us artisans and tradesmen that the salvation of the fatherland is entrusted; but we are not equal to such a task; never, indeed, have we claimed that we were capable of performing it. It is a misunderstanding; and it is proving our ruin.","People under suspicion are better moving than at rest, since at rest they may be sitting in the balance without knowing it, being weighed together with their sins.","You once said you would like to sit beside me while I write. Listen, in that case I could not write (I can\u2019t do much, anyway), but in that case I could not write at all. For writing means revealing oneself to excess; that utmost of selfrevelation and surrender, in which a human being, when involved with others, would feel he was losing himself, and from which, therefore, he will always shrink as long as he is in his right mind\u2014for everyone wants to live as long as he is alive \u2014even that degree of selfrevelation and surrender is not enough for writing. Writing that springs from the surface of existence\u2014 when there is no other way and the deeper wells have dried up\u2014is nothing, and collapses the moment a truer emotion makes that surface shake. This is why one can never be alone enough when one writes, why there can never be enough silence around one when one writes, why even night is not night enough. This is why there is never enough time at one\u2019s disposal, for the roads are long and it is easy to go astray, there are even times when one becomes afraid and has the desire\u2014even without any constraint or enticement\u2014to run back (a desire always severely punished later on), how much more so if one were suddenly to receive a kiss from the most beloved lips! I have often thought that the best mode of life for me would be to sit in the innermost room of a spacious locked cellar with my writing things and a lamp. Food would be brought and always put down far away from my room, outside the cellar\u2019s outermost door. The walk to my food, in my dressing gown, through the vaulted cellars, would be my only exercise. I would then return to my table, eat slowly and with deliberation, then start writing again at once. And how I would write! From what depths I would drag it up! Without effort! For extreme concentration knows no effort. The trouble is that I might not be able to keep it up for long, and at the first failure\u2014which perhaps even in these circumstances could not be avoided\u2014would be bound to end in a grandiose fit of madness.","Over the table, on which an unpacked line of fabric samples was all spread out -- Samsa was a traveling salesman -- hung the picture which he had recently cut out of a glossy magazine and lodged in a pretty gilt frame. It showed a lady done up in a fur hat and a fur boa, sitting upright and raising up against the viewer a heavy fur muff in which her whole forearm had disappeared.","Looking on oneself as something alien, forgetting the sight, remembering the gaze.","A piece like a segment has been cut out of the back of his head.

Thanks to their affliction they constitute a circle and provide each other mutual support. They glide along the inner borders of their circle, make way for or jostle one another gently in the crowd... There exists not the shadow of a thought to give the comforter an advantage over the comforted. Thus their conversations consist only of a coming-together of their imaginations, outpourings of wishes from one upon the other... Sometimes they will unite in faith and, their heads together, look up into the unending reaches of the sky. Recognition of their situation shows itself, however, only when they bow down their heads in common and the common hammer descends upon them.","Querido padre:Me preguntaste una vez por qu\xe9 afirmaba yo que te tengo miedo.Como de costumbre, no supe qu\xe9 contestar, en parte, justamente por elmiedo que te tengo, y en parte porque en los fundamentos de ese miedoentran demasiados detalles como para que pueda mantenerlos reunidosen el curso de una conversaci\xf3n.

That\'s obviously a very bad place for the bed, in front of the door. For instance when the judge I\'m painting at present comes he always comes through the door by the bed, and I\'ve even given him a key to this door so that he can wait for me here in the studio when I\'m not home. Although nowadays he usually comes early in the morning when I\'m still asleep. And of course, it always wakes me up when I hear the door opened beside the bed, however fast asleep I am. If you could hear the way I curse him as he climbs over my bed in the morning you\'d lose all respect for judges. I suppose I could take the key away from him but that\'d only make things worse. It only takes a tiny effort to break any of the doors here off their hinges.","My health is only just good enough for myself alone, not good enough for marriage, let alone fatherhood.

The children simply don\u2019t have any time in which they might be children........Indeed... there\u2019s simply no way that we would be able to provide our children with a viable childhood, one that is real. Naturally, there are consequences. There\u2019s a certain ever present, not to be liquidated childishness that permeates our folk; We often act in ways that are totally and utterly ridiculous and, indeed, precisely like children we do things that are crazy, letting loose with our assets in a manner that is bereft of all rationality, prodigious in our celebrations, partaking in a light-headed frivolousness that is divorced from all sensibility, and often enough all simply for the sake of some small token of fun, so much do we love having our small amusements. But our folk isn\u2019t only childish, to a certain extent we also age prematurely, childhood and old age mix themselves differently with us than by others. We don\u2019t have any youth, we jump right away into maturity and, then, we remain grown-ups for too long and as a consequence to this there\u2019s a broad shadow of a certain tiredness and a sort of hopelessness that colours our essential nature, a nature that as a whole is otherwise so tenacious and permeated by hope, strong hope. This, no doubt, this is related to why we\u2019re so disinclined toward music\u2014we\u2019re too old for music, so much excitement, so much passion doesn\u2019t sit well with our heaviness;","In her opinion her singing falls on deaf ears anyway; there is no lack of enthusiasm and applause, but she has long since given up hope of genuine understanding as she conceives it.","He accepted it as a fundamental principle for an accused man to be always forearmed, never to let himself be caught napping, never to let his eyes stray unthinkingly to the right when his judge was looming up on the left--to the right when his judge was looming up on the left--and against that very principle he kept offending again and again.","The officials are very well educated, but only in a one-sided way; in his own department, an official will see a whole train of ideas behind a single word, but you can spend hours on end explaining matters from another department to him, and while he may nod politely he doesn\u2019t understand a bit of it. Of course that\u2019s all perfectly natural, you just have to think of the little official matters affecting yourself, tiny things that an official will deal with merely by shrugging his shoulders, you just have to understand that thoroughly, and then you will have plenty to occupy your mind all your life and never run out of ideas.","The messiah will come when we don\'t need him anymore.","La comparaci\xf3n del p\xe1jaro en mano y ciento volando s\xf3lo se puede aplicar aqu\xed muy relativamente.

The roof of this wretched life, of which you say so many hard things, will burst open, and all of us, shoulder to shoulder, will ascend into the lofty realm of freedom. And if we should not achieve the final consummation, if things should become worse than before, if the whole truth should be more insupportable than the half-truth, if it should be proved that the silent are the guardians of existence, if the faint hope that we still possess should give way to complete hopelessness, the attempt is still worth the trial, since you do not desire to live as you are compelled to live.","For Kafka, paradise wasn\u2019t a place where people lived in the past and of which a memory has survived, but rather a perennial, hidden presence. In every moment, an immense, encompassing obstacle prevents us from seeing it.

That, my dear, is love -Letters to Milena\u201d","For example, my choice of career. You generously and patiently gave me complete freedom.\xa0 Though this followed the habits, or at least the values, of the Jewish middle class concerning their sons.\xa0 And here your misunder-standing of my character worked its effect, which \u2013 together with your father\u2019s pride \u2013 blinded you to my real nature: to my weakness.\xa0 In your opinion, I was always studying as a child, and \xa0later I was always writing.\xa0 Looking back that \xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0is certainly not true.\xa0 I can say with very little exaggeration, I barely studied and I learnt nothing; to have retained something after so many years of education wasn\u2019t remarkable for a man with a memory and some intelligence;\xa0 but given the vast expenditure of time and money, and my outwardly easy, unburdened life, what I achieved with regard to knowledge, especially sound knowledge, was nothing \u2013 certainly when compared to what others managed.\xa0 It is lamentable, but for me understandable.\xa0 I always had such a deep concern about the continued existence of my mind and spirit, that I was indifferent to everything else.\xa0 Jewish schoolboys have a reputation, for amongst them one finds the most improbable things; but my cold, barely disguised, permanent, childish, ridiculous, animal, self-satisfied indifference, and my cold and fantastical mind, are not things that I have ever met again \u2013 though admittedly they were just a defence against nervous destruction through fear and guilt.\xa0 And I was worried about myself in all manner of ways.\xa0 For example, I was worried about my health: I was worried about my hair falling out, my digestion, and my back \u2013 for it was stooped.\xa0 And my worries turned to fear and it all ended in true sickness.\xa0 But what was all that?\xa0 Not actual bodily sickness.\xa0 I was sick because I was a disinherited son, who needed constant reassurance about his own peculiar existence, who in the most profound sense never owned anything, and who was even insecure about the thing which was next to him: his own body.","I am not of the opinion that one can ever lack the power to express perfectly what one wants to write or say. Observations on the weakness of language, and comparisons between the limitations of words and the infinity of feelings, are quite fallacious. The infinite feeling continues to be as infinite in words as it was in the heart. What is clear within is bound to become so in words as well. This is why one need never worry about language, but at sight of words may often worry about oneself. After all, who knows within himself how things really are with him? This tempestuous or floundering or morasslike inner self is what we really are, but by the secret process by which words are forced out of us, our self-knowledge is brought to light, and though it may still be veiled, yet it is there before us, wonderful or terrible to behold.","Odandan \xe7\u0131kman gerekmez, masanda oturmaya devam et ve dinle..

Who walks under the trees of the quay? Who is quite lost? Who is past saving? Over whose grave does the grass grow? Dreams have arrived, upstream they came. They came, they climb up the walls of the quay on a ladder. One stops makes conversation with them, they know a number of things, but what they don\u2019t know is where they come from. It is quite warm this autumn evening. They turn toward the river and raise their arms. Why do you raise your amrs instead of clasping us in them?","For now he must lie low and try, through patience and the greatest consideration, to help his family bear the inconvenience he was bound to cause them in his present condition.","We are as forlorn as children lost in the wood. When you stand before me and look at me, what do you know of the griefs within me and what do I know of yours? And if I were to cast myself down before you and tell you, what more would you know about me than you know about Hell when someone tells you it is hot and dreadful? For that reason alone we human beings ought to stand before one another as reverently, as reflectively, as lovingly, as we would before the entrance to Hell","Faptele dumneavoastra vor lasa poate urme ad\xeenci de pasi \xeen zapada, dar at\xeet.","But all remains unchanged.","For a man under suspicion movement is better than rest, for the man who is at rest can always, without knowing it, be on the scales being weighed together with his sins.","When I say something, this thing immediately and definitively loses its importance.

His eyes watered with contentment as he gulped down the cheese, the vegetables, and the sauce in rapid succession. By contrast, he did not relish the fresh foods, he could not even stand their smells, and he actually dragged the things he wanted to eat a short distance away.","It is only our conception of time that makes us call the Last Judgment by this name.

Ah, one learns when one has to; one learns when one needs a way out; one learns at all costs. One stands over oneself with a whip; one flays oneself at the slightest opposition. My ape nature fled out of me, head over heels and away, so that my first teacher was almost himself turned into an ape by it and was taken away to a mental hospital. Fortunately he was soon let out again. \\tBut I used up many teachers, several teachers at once. As I became more confident of my abilities, as the public took and interest in my progress and my future began to look bright, I engaged teachers for myself, engaged them in five communicating rooms, and took lessons from all at once by dint of leaping from one room to the other.\\tThat progress of mine! How the rays of knowledge penetrated from all sides into my awakening brain? I do not deny it: I found it exhilarating. But I must also confess: I did not overestimate it, not even then, much less now. With an effort which up till now has never been repeated I managed to reach the cultural level of an average European. In itself that might be nothing to speak of, but it is something insofar as it has helped me out of my cage and opened a special way out for me, the way of humanity. There is an excellent idiom: to fight one\u2019s way through the thick of things; that is what I have done, I have fought through the thick of things. There was nothing else for me to do, provided that freedom was not to be my choice. \\tAs I look back on my development and survey what I have achieved so far, I do not complain, but I am not complacent either. With my hands in my trouser pockets, my bottle of wine on the table, I half lie and half sit in my rocking chair and gaze out of the window: If a visitor arrives I receive him with propriety. My manager sits in the anteroom; when I ring, he comes and listens to what I have to say. Nearly every evening I give a performance, and I have a success that could hardly be increased. When I come home late at night from banquets, from scientific receptions, from social gatherings, there sits waiting for me a half-trained chimpanzee and I take comfort from her as apes do. By day I cannot bear to see her; for she has the insane look of the bewildered half-broken animal in her eye, no one else sees it, but I do, and I cannot bear it.

They have done something bad, certainly or possibly, and the dirt of this scene derives, as you rightly say, essentially from their being strangers, and it\'s physical dirt, like the dirt of an apartment which has never been inhabited and suddenly ripped wide open. This is bad indeed, or on Earth, it\'s actually nothing but a \'play with a ball\' as you call it. It\'s as though Eve, having indeed plucked the apple from the tree (sometimes I believe I understand the Fall of Man as no one else), did so nevertheless only in order to show it to Adam - because she liked it. It was the biting into it that was decisive - the playing with it was, though not permitted, not forbidden either.","Sometimes he mulled over the idea that the next time the door opened he would take control of the family affairs as he had done in the past; these musings led him once more after such a long interval to conjure up the figures of the boss, the head clerk, the salesmen, the apprentices, the dullard of an office manager, two or three friends from other firms, a sweet and fleeting memory of a chambermaid in one of the rural hotels, a cashier in a milliner\'s shop whom he had wooed earnestly but too slowly- they all appeared mixed up with strangers or nearly forgotten people, but instead of helping him and his family they were each and every one unapproachable, and he was relieved when they evaporated.","I was a timid child.

I am sure that Mother spoiled me too, but I cannot believe I was particularly difficult to manage; I cannot believe that a kindly word, a quiet taking by the hand, a friendly look, could not have got me to do anything that was wanted of me. Now you are, after all, basically a charitable and kindhearted person (what follows will not be in contradiction to this, I am speaking only of the impression you made on the child), but not every child has the endurance and fearlessness to go on searching until it comes to the kindliness that lies beneath the surface. You can treat a child only in the way you yourself are constituted, with vigor, noise, and hot temper, and in this case such behavior seemed to you to be also most appropriate because you wanted to bring me up to be a strong, brave boy.","Shoulder to shoulder, a coordinated movement of the people, their blood no longer confined in the limited circulation of the body but rolling sweetly and yet still returning through the infinite extent of China.","No one sings as purely as those who inhabit the deepest hell\u2014what we take to be the song of angels is their song.","Teoricamente, s\xf3 h\xe1 uma possibilidade perfeita de felicidade: acreditar no indestrut\xedvel em si sem a ele aspirar.","\u038c\u03c4\u03b1\u03bd \u03cc\u03bb\u03b1 \u03bc\u03bf\u03b9\u03ac\u03b6\u03bf\u03c5\u03bd \u03c4\u03b5\u03bb\u03b5\u03b9\u03c9\u03bc\u03ad\u03bd\u03b1, \u03b1\u03bd\u03b1\u03b4\u03cd\u03bf\u03bd\u03c4\u03b1\u03b9 \u03bd\u03ad\u03b5\u03c2 \u03b4\u03c5\u03bd\u03ac\u03bc\u03b5\u03b9\u03c2. \u0391\u03c5\u03c4\u03cc \u03c3\u03b7\u03bc\u03b1\u03af\u03bd\u03b5\u03b9 \u03c0\u03c9\u03c2 \u03b6\u03b5\u03b9\u03c2.","That is a very poor career, but only a poor career give the world the light that an imperfect, but pretty good writer wants to generate--at all costs, unfotunately.","One does not have to believe everything is true, one only has to believe it is necessary.","Milena who is constantly discovering in herself that the only way to save another person is by being there and nothing else.","One morning Gregor Samsa found himself, in bed, transformed into a monstrous vermin.","Atata timp cat nu incetezi s urci, treptele nu se vOr termina; sub pasii tai care urca, ele se vOr inmulti la nesfarsit","Enlightenment comes to even the dimmest.

La sencilla posibilidad de escribir cartas debe de haber provocado -desde un punto de vista meramente te\xf3rico- una terrible desintegraci\xf3n de almas en el mundo. Es en efecto una conversaci\xf3n con fantasmas ( y para peor no s\xf3lo con el fantasma del destinatario, sino tambi\xe9n con el del remitente) que se desarrolla entre l\xedneas en la carta que uno escribe, o aun en una serie de cartas, donde cada una corrobora la otra y puede referirse a ella como testigo. \xbfDe d\xf3nde habr\xe1 surgido la idea de que las personas pod\xedan comunicarse mediante cartas? Se puede pensar en una persona distante, se puede aferrar a una persona cercana, todo lo dem\xe1s queda m\xe1s all\xe1 de las fuerzas humanas. Escribir cartas, sin embargo, significa desnudarse ante los fantasmas, que lo esperan \xe1vidamente. Los besos por escrito no llegan a su destino, se los beben por el camino los fantasmas. Con este abundante alimento se multiplican, en efecto, enormemente. La humanidad lo percibe y lucha por evitarlo; y para eliminar en lo posible lo fantasmal entre las personas y lograr una comunicaci\xf3n natural, que es la paz de las almas, ha inventado el ferrocarril, el autom\xf3vil, el aeroplano, pero ya no sirven, son evidentemente descubrimientos hechos en el momento del desastre, el bando opuesto es tanto m\xe1s calmo y poderoso, despu\xe9s del correo invent\xf3 el tel\xe9grafo, el tel\xe9fono, la telegraf\xeda sin hilos.

And when a red-hot flame leaps forth, poignant and piercing, from such retrospective ash, and you fix your gaze upon it, as if gripped by its magic spell, then...

But only generally; otherwise it varies, and perhaps it doesn\u2019t even vary as much as Klamm\u2019s actual appearance. He is supposed to look quite different when he arrives in the village and when he leaves, different before and after he\u2019s been drinking beer, different when he\u2019s awake and when he\u2019s asleep, different when he\u2019s alone and when he\u2019s talking to someone \u2013 and then, as you can imagine, almost completely different up at the Castle. And even when he\u2019s in the village there are reports of quite substantial differences, differences in his height, his shape, his weight, his beard. Fortunately, there\u2019s one thing the descriptions agree about, his clothes \u2013 he\u2019s always dressed the same: in a black frock coat with long tails. Of course, all these differences are due to magic, they are quite understandable because they depend on the present mood, the level of excitement, the countless degrees of hope or despair on the part of the observer, who is in any case only able to catch a momentary glimpse of Klamm. I\u2019m telling you all this just as Barnabas has often explained it to me, and on the whole it\u2019s reassuring as long as one\u2019s not directly or personally involved.

Writing letters, on the other hand, means exposing oneself to the ghosts, who are greedily waiting precisely for that. Written kisses never arrive at their destination; the ghosts drink them up along the way. It is this ample nourishment which enables them to multiply so enormously. People sense this and struggle against it; in order to eliminate as much of the ghosts\u2019 power as possible and to attain a natural intercourse, a tranquility of soul, they have invented trains, cars, aeroplanes\u2014but nothing helps anymore: These are evidently inventions devised at the moment of crashing. The opposing side is so much calmer and stronger; after the postal system, the ghosts invented the telegraph, the telephone, the wireless. They will not starve, but we will perish.","First of all, the free man is superior to the bound man. Now the man is in fact free: he can go wherever he wishes, the entrance to the Law alone is denied to him, and this only by one person, the doorkeeper. If he sits on the stool at the side of the door and spends the rest of his life there, he does so of his own free will; the story mentions no element of force.","\u0412 \u0434\u043d\u0435\u0432\u043d\u0438\u043a\u0435 \u043d\u0430\u0445\u043e\u0434\u0438\u0448\u044c \u0434\u043e\u043a\u0430\u0437\u0430\u0442\u0435\u043b\u044c\u0441\u0442\u0432\u0430 \u0442\u043e\u0433\u043e, \u0447\u0442\u043e \u0434\u0430\u0436\u0435 \u0432 \u0441\u043e\u0441\u0442\u043e\u044f\u043d\u0438\u044f\u0445, \u043a\u043e\u0442\u043e\u0440\u044b\u0435 \u0441\u0435\u0433\u043e\u0434\u043d\u044f \u043a\u0430\u0436\u0443\u0442\u0441\u044f \u043d\u0435\u0432\u044b\u043d\u043e\u0441\u0438\u043c\u044b\u043c\u0438, \u0442\u044b \u0436\u0438\u043b, \u0441\u043c\u043e\u0442\u0440\u0435\u043b \u0432\u043e\u043a\u0440\u0443\u0433 \u0438 \u0437\u0430\u043f\u0438\u0441\u044b\u0432\u0430\u043b \u0441\u0432\u043e\u0438 \u043d\u0430\u0431\u043b\u044e\u0434\u0435\u043d\u0438\u044f, \u0447\u0442\u043e, \u0442\u0430\u043a\u0438\u043c \u043e\u0431\u0440\u0430\u0437\u043e\u043c, \u0432\u043e\u0442 \u044d\u0442\u0430 \u043f\u0440\u0430\u0432\u0430\u044f \u0440\u0443\u043a\u0430 \u0434\u0432\u0438\u0433\u0430\u043b\u0430\u0441\u044c, \u043a\u0430\u043a \u0441\u0435\u0433\u043e\u0434\u043d\u044f, \u043a\u043e\u0433\u0434\u0430 \u0442\u044b \u0431\u043b\u0430\u0433\u043e\u0434\u0430\u0440\u044f \u0432\u043e\u0437\u043c\u043e\u0436\u043d\u043e\u0441\u0442\u0438 \u043e\u0431\u043e\u0437\u0440\u0435\u0442\u044c \u0442\u043e\u0433\u0434\u0430\u0448\u043d\u0435\u0435 \u0441\u043e\u0441\u0442\u043e\u044f\u043d\u0438\u0435, \u043f\u0440\u0430\u0432\u0434\u0430, \u043f\u043e\u0443\u043c\u043d\u0435\u043b, \u043d\u043e \u0441 \u0442\u0435\u043c \u0431\u043e\u043b\u044c\u0448\u0438\u043c \u043e\u0441\u043d\u043e\u0432\u0430\u043d\u0438\u0435\u043c \u0442\u044b \u0434\u043e\u043b\u0436\u0435\u043d \u043f\u0440\u0438\u0437\u043d\u0430\u0442\u044c \u0431\u0435\u0441\u0441\u0442\u0440\u0430\u0448\u0438\u0435 \u0441\u0432\u043e\u0435\u0433\u043e \u0442\u043e\u0433\u0434\u0430\u0448\u043d\u0435\u0433\u043e \u0441\u0442\u0440\u0435\u043c\u043b\u0435\u043d\u0438\u044f, \u0441\u043e\u0445\u0440\u0430\u043d\u0438\u0432\u0448\u0435\u0433\u043e\u0441\u044f, \u043d\u0435\u0441\u043c\u043e\u0442\u0440\u044f \u043d\u0430 \u043f\u043e\u043b\u043d\u043e\u0435 \u043d\u0435\u0432\u0435\u0434\u0435\u043d\u0438\u0435.","\u042f \u043d\u0435\u043d\u0430\u0432\u0438\u0436\u0443 \u0432\u0441\u0435, \u0447\u0442\u043e \u043d\u0435 \u0438\u043c\u0435\u0435\u0442 \u043e\u0442\u043d\u043e\u0448\u0435\u043d\u0438\u044f \u043a \u043b\u0438\u0442\u0435\u0440\u0430\u0442\u0443\u0440\u0435, \u043c\u043d\u0435 \u0441\u043a\u0443\u0447\u043d\u043e \u0432\u0435\u0441\u0442\u0438 \u0440\u0430\u0437\u0433\u043e\u0432\u043e\u0440\u044b (\u0434\u0430\u0436\u0435 \u043e \u043b\u0438\u0442\u0435\u0440\u0430\u0442\u0443\u0440\u0435), \u043c\u043d\u0435 \u0441\u043a\u0443\u0447\u043d\u043e \u0445\u043e\u0434\u0438\u0442\u044c \u0432 \u0433\u043e\u0441\u0442\u0438, \u0433\u043e\u0440\u0435\u0441\u0442\u0438 \u0438 \u0440\u0430\u0434\u043e\u0441\u0442\u0438 \u043c\u043e\u0438\u0445 \u0440\u043e\u0434\u0441\u0442\u0432\u0435\u043d\u043d\u0438\u043a\u043e\u0432 \u043c\u043d\u0435 \u0441\u043c\u0435\u0440\u0442\u0435\u043b\u044c\u043d\u043e \u0441\u043a\u0443\u0447\u043d\u044b. \u0420\u0430\u0437\u0433\u043e\u0432\u043e\u0440\u044b \u043b\u0438\u0448\u0430\u044e\u0442 \u0432\u0441\u0435 \u043c\u043e\u0438 \u043c\u044b\u0441\u043b\u0438 \u0432\u0430\u0436\u043d\u043e\u0441\u0442\u0438, \u0441\u0435\u0440\u044c\u0435\u0437\u043d\u043e\u0441\u0442\u0438, \u0438\u0441\u0442\u0438\u043d\u043d\u043e\u0441\u0442\u0438.","Uncertainty, aridity, peace-all things will resolve themselves into these and pass away.","Incerteza, secura, sil\xeancio. \xc9 nisto que tudo passar\xe1.Que tenho de comum com os judeus?

All those contacts are merely apparent, but in your case, because of your ignorance of the situation here, you think they\u2019re real. As for the telephone: look, in my own house, though I certainly deal often with the authorities, there\u2019s no telephone. At inns and in places like that it may serve a useful purpose, along the lines, say, of an automated phonograph, but that\u2019s all. Have you ever telephoned here, you have? Well then, perhaps you can understand me. At the Castle the telephone seems to work extremely well; I\u2019ve been told the telephones up there are in constant use, which of course greatly speeds up the work. Here on our local telephones we hear that constant telephoning as a murmuring and singing, you must have heard it too. Well, this murmuring and singing is the only true and reliable thing that the local telephones convey to us, everything else is deceptive. There is no separate telephone connection to the Castle and no switchboard to forward our calls; when anyone here calls the Castle, all the telephones in the lowest-level departments ring, or all would ring if the ringing mechanism on nearly all of them were not, and I know this for certain, disconnected. Now and then, though, an overtired official needs some diversion\u2014especially late in the evening or at night\u2014and turns on the ringing mechanism, then we get an answer, though an answer that\u2019s no more than a joke. That\u2019s certainly quite understandable. For who can claim to have the right, simply because of some petty personal concerns, to ring during the most important work, conducted, as always, at a furious pace? Nor can I understand how even a stranger can believe that if he calls Sordini, for instance, it really is Sordini who answers. Quite the contrary, it\u2019s probably a lowly filing clerk from an entirely different department. But it can happen, if only at the most auspicious moment, that someone telephones the lowly filing clerk and Sordini himself answers. Then of course it\'s best to run from the telephone before hearing a sound.\u201d","His numerous legs, pitifully thin in comparison to the rest of his circumference, flickered helplessly before his eyes.","DEAR NEPHEW,\xa0\xa0\xa0As you will already have realized during our much too brief companionship, I am essentially a man of principle.

And there\'s no map.","Stoga, ipak, kao najbolji savjet ostaje: primati sve onako kako je, pona\u0161ati se kao te\u0161ka masa, pa makar se sam osje\u0107ao kao da si otpuhan, ne dopustiti da te ne\u0161to namami na pogre\u0161an korak, promatrati druge \u017eivotinjskim pogledom, ne osje\u0107ati kajanje, ukratko - vlastitom rukom pritiskati ono \u0161to je od \u017eivota jo\u0161 ostalo kao avet, to jest jo\u0161 uve\u0107ati posljednji grobni mir i ne znati vi\u0161e za postojanje i\u010dega drugog osim njega.Karakteristi\u010dan pokret takvog stanja jeste prela\u017eenje malim prstom preko obrva.","K. eventually had to give up asking if he did not want to be led all round from floor to floor in this way. He regretted his initial plan, which had at first seemed so practical to him. As he reached the fifth floor, he decided to give up the search, took his leave of a friendly, young worker who wanted to lead him on still further and went down the stairs. But then the thought of how much time he was wasting made him cross, he went back again and knocked at the first door on the fifth floor. The first thing he saw in the small room was a large clock on the wall which already showed ten o\u2019clock.","If anything, his parables guarantee the failure not only of his characters, but of readers wishing to abstract any lessons applicable to their own lives. Failure, it seems, is Kafka\'s true subject.","Why do you have to go to the cathedral?\' said Leni. K. tried to explain briefly, but he had hardly begun when Leni suddenly said: \'They are hounding you.\' K., who could not bear anyone feeling sorry for him unexpectedly or gratuitously, broke off abruptly with just two words; but as he hung up the receiver he said, half to himself and half to the distant woman who could no longer hear him: \'Yes, they are hounding me.","Human beings have to have their sleep.","Sa svog naslonja\u010da vladao si svijetom.

Instead of waking up from a nightmare, Gregor wakes up into one. Reality, the only balm for bad dreams, is significantly less reassuring when you wake up hideously disfigured.","Ako te to toliko mami, a ti poku\u0161aj da ode\u0161 tamo.

When you stand in front of me and look at me, what do you know of the griefs that are in me and what do I know of yours. And if I were to cast myself down before you and weep and tell you, what more would you know about me than you know about Hell when someone tells you it is hot and dreadful? For that reason alone we human beings ought to stand before one another as reverently, as reflectively, as lovingly, as we would before the Gate of Hell.","If they were shocked, then Gregor was no longer responsible.\' This passage betray\'s Gregor\'s premeditation and points to the idea that Gregor wanted to change into a monstrous vermin- something incapable of working in an office.","I\'m in a tight spot, but I\'ll also work my way out again.","A loyal and loving son, Gregor feels obligated to pay off his parents\' debt. Simply quitting would betray that loyalty.","Ante la Ley hay un guardi\xe1n. Hasta ese guardi\xe1n llega un campesino y le ruega que le permita entrar a la Ley. Pero el guardi\xe1n responde que en ese momento no le puede franquear el acceso. El hombre reflexiona y luego pregunta si es que podr\xe1 entrar m\xe1s tarde. \u2014Es posible \u2014dice el guardi\xe1n\u2014, pero ahora, no. Las puertas de la Ley est\xe1n abiertas, como siempre, y el guardi\xe1n se ha hecho a un lado, de modo que el hombre se inclina para atisbar el interior. Cuando el guardi\xe1n lo advierte, r\xede y dice: \u2014Si tanto te atrae, intenta entrar a pesar de mi prohibici\xf3n. Pero recuerda esto: yo soy poderoso. Y yo soy s\xf3lo el \xfaltimo de los guardianes. De sala en sala ir\xe1s encontrando guardianes cada vez m\xe1s poderosos. Ni siquiera yo puedo soportar la sola vista del tercero. El campesino no hab\xeda previsto semejantes dificultades. Despu\xe9s de todo, la Ley deber\xeda ser accesible a todos y en todo momento, piensa. Pero cuando mira con m\xe1s detenimiento al guardi\xe1n, con su largo abrigo de pieles, su gran nariz puntiaguda, la larga y negra barba de t\xe1rtaro, se decide a esperar hasta que \xe9l le conceda el permiso para entrar. El guardi\xe1n le da un banquillo y le permite sentarse al lado de la puerta. All\xed permanece el hombre d\xedas y a\xf1os. Muchas veces intenta entrar e importuna al guardi\xe1n con sus ruegos. El guardi\xe1n le formula, con frecuencia, peque\xf1os interrogatorios. Le pregunta acerca de su terru\xf1o y de muchas otras cosas; pero son preguntas indiferentes, como las de los grandes se\xf1ores, y al final le repite siempre que a\xfan no lo puede dejar entrar. El hombre, que estaba bien provisto para el viaje, invierte todo \u2014hasta lo m\xe1s valioso\u2014 en sobornar al guardi\xe1n. Este acepta todo, pero siempre repite lo mismo: \u2014Lo acepto para que no creas que has omitido alg\xfan esfuerzo. Durante todos esos a\xf1os, el hombre observa ininterrumpidamente al guardi\xe1n. Olvida a todos los dem\xe1s guardianes y aqu\xe9l le parece ser el \xfanico obst\xe1culo que se opone a su acceso a la Ley. Durante los primeros a\xf1os maldice su suerte en voz alta, sin reparar en nada; cuando envejece, ya s\xf3lo murmura como para s\xed. Se vuelve pueril, y como en esos a\xf1os que ha consagrado al estudio del guardi\xe1n ha llegado a conocer hasta las pulgas de su cuello de pieles, tambi\xe9n suplica a las pulgas que lo ayuden a persuadir al guardi\xe1n. Finalmente su vista se debilita y ya no sabe si en la realidad est\xe1 oscureciendo a su alrededor o si lo enga\xf1an los ojos. Pero en aquellas penumbras descubre un resplandor inextinguible que emerge de las puertas de la Ley. Ya no le resta mucha vida. Antes de morir resume todas las experiencias de aquellos a\xf1os en una pregunta, que nunca hab\xeda formulado al guardi\xe1n. Le hace una se\xf1a para que se aproxime, pues su cuerpo r\xedgido ya no le permite incorporarse. El guardi\xe1n se ve obligado a inclinarse mucho, porque las diferencias de estatura se han acentuado se\xf1aladamente con el tiempo, en desmedro del campesino. \u2014\xbfQu\xe9 quieres saber ahora? \u2013pregunta el guardi\xe1n\u2014. Eres insaciable. \u2014Todos buscan la Ley \u2013dice el hombre\u2014. \xbfY c\xf3mo es que en todos los a\xf1os que llevo aqu\xed, nadie m\xe1s que yo ha solicitado permiso para llegar a ella? El guardi\xe1n comprende que el hombre est\xe1 a punto de expirar y le grita, para que sus o\xeddos debilitados perciban las palabras. \u2014Nadie m\xe1s pod\xeda entrar por aqu\xed, porque esta entrada estaba destinada a ti solamente.

Zij kon hem niet dadelijk vinden, maar toen zij hem onder de canap\xe9 ontdekte - God, hij moest toch \xe9rgens zijn, hij had toch niet kunnen wegvliegen - , schrok zij zo, dat zij, zonder zich te kunnen beheersen, de deur van buitenaf weer dichtsloeg. Maar alsof zij berouw had van haar handelwijze, deed zij de deur meteen weer open en kwam, als ging het om een ernstige zieke of zelfs een vreemde, op haar tenen binnen. Gregor had zijn kop tot vlak aan de rand van de canap\xe9 naar voren geschoven en observeerde haar. Of zij wel zou merken dat hij de melk had laten staan, en wel allerminst uit gebrek aan eetlust, en of zij ander voedsel zou komen brengen, dat meer aan zijn wensen tegemoet kwam? Als zij het niet uit zichzelf deed wilde hij liever verhongeren dan haar erop attent te maken, hoewel hij eigenlijk een geweldige aandrang voelde om onder de canap\xe9 vandaan te schieten, zich aan zijn zusters voeten te werpen en haar om wat lekker eten te smeken. Maar zijn zuster zag dadelijk tot haar verbazing de nog volle kom, waaruit alleen rondom een beetje melk was gemorst, zij nam hem meteen op, weliswaar niet met haar blote handen maar met een lap, en droeg hem de kamer uit. Gregor was uiterst nieuwsgierig wat zij ter vervanging zou brengen en hij maakte zich daar de meest uiteenlopende voorstellingen van. Nooit had hij echter kunnen raden wat zijn zuster in haar goedheid werkelijk deed. Zij bracht hem, om zijn smaak te onderzoeken, een hele keur aan spijzen, op een oude krant uitgespreid. Er was oude, half verrotte groente; botten van het avondeten in een gestolde witte saus, wat rozijnen en amandelen; een kaas die Gregor twee dagen tevoren oneetbaar had verklaard; een stuk droog brood, een met boter besmeerd stuk brood en een met boter besmeerd en gezouten stuk brood. Bovendien zette zij bij dit alles ook nog de waarschijnlijk definitief voor Gregor bestemde kom neer, waarin zij water had gegoten.","Anything but stop halfway,","The only thing I can do now is preserve my logical understanding to the end.

If the book we\'re reading doesn\'t wake us up with a blow to the head, what are we reading for? So that it will make us happy, as you write? Good Lord, we would be happy precisely if we had no books, and the kind of books that make us happy are the kind we could write ourselves if we had to. But we need books that affect us like a disaster, that grieve us deeply, like the death of someone we loved more than ourselves, like being banished into forests far from everyone, like a suicide. A book must be the axe for the frozen sea within us. That is my belief. \u2015 Franz Kafka\u201d","La poes\xeda es enfermedad. Mas no basta con reducir la fiebre para estar sano.

The clocks are not in unison; the inner one runs crazily on at a devilish or demoniac or in any case inhuman pace, the outer one limps along at its usual speed. What else can happen but that the two worlds split apart, and they do split apart, or at least clash in a fearful manner. There are doubtless several reasons for the wild tempo of the inner process; the most obvious one is introspection, which will suffer no idea to sink tranquilly to rest but must pursue each one into consciousness, only itself to become an idea, in turn to be pursued by renewed introspection. Secondly: this pursuit, originating in the midst of men, carries one in a direction away from them. The solitude that for the most part has been forced on me, in part voluntarily sought by me \u2013but what was this if not compulsion too? \u2013is now losing all its ambiguity and approaches its d\xe9nouement. Where is it leading? The strongest likelihood is, that it may lead to madness; there is nothing more to say, the pursuit goes right through me and rends me asunder. Or I can \u2013can I? \u2013manage to keep my feet somewhat and be carried along in the wild pursuit. Where, then, shall I be brought? \u2018Pursuit,\u2019 indeed, is only a metaphor. I can also say, \u2018assault on the last earthly frontier\u2019, an assault, moreover, launched from below, from mankind, and since this too is a metaphor, I can replace it by the metaphor of an assault from above, aimed at me from above.","Church staff creep silently as part of their job, you don\u2019t notice them.","Breadwinning and the art of writing must be kept absolutely apart.","During these last decades the interest in professional fasting has markedly diminished.","the strange, mysterious, perhaps dangerous, perhaps saving comfort that there is in writing...[is] a leap out of murderer\'s row.","Mi verdadero miedo consiste en que jam\xe1s podr\xe9 poseerte.

That\u2019s the position he sleeps in, the gentlemen sleep a great deal, it\u2019s hard to understand. Then again, if he didn\u2019t sleep so much, how could he stand those men? Well, I\u2019ll have to chase them out myself.\u2019 And picking up a whip from the corner, she took a single awkward leap high into the air, rather like a lamb gambolling, and made for the dancers. At first they turned to her as if she were a new dancer joining them, and indeed, for a moment it looked as if Frieda would drop the whip, but then she raised it again. \u2018In the name of Klamm,\u2019 she cried, \u2018out into the stables, all of you, out into the stables.\u2019 Now they saw that she was serious, and in a kind of terror that K. couldn\u2019t understand, they began crowding away to the back of the room. A door was pushed open by the first to get there, night air blew in, and they all disappeared with Frieda, who was obviously driving them across the yard to the stables.","K. was not afraid of the landlady\u2019s threats, and he was tired of the hopes in which she was trying to entangle him. Klamm was far away; the landlady had once compared Klamm to an eagle, which had struck K. as ridiculous at the time, but not any more; he thought of Klamm\u2019s remote distance, his impregnable residence, his silence, perhaps interrupted only by such screams as K. had never heard. He thought of Klamm\u2019s piercing glance from on high that would brook no contradiction and couldn\u2019t be tested either, of the immutable circles in which he soared, free from any interference by the likes of K. down below, moving by inscrutable laws and visible only for brief moments\u2014Klamm and the eagle had all this in common.","\u053b\u0576\u0584\u0576\u0561\u057d\u057a\u0561\u0576 \u056c\u056b\u0576\u0565\u056c\u0576 \u0561\u0575\u0576\u0584\u0561\u0576 \u0561\u0576\u056b\u0574\u0561\u057d\u057f \u0562\u0561\u0576 \u0567\u0580, \u0578\u0580 \u0576\u0561, \u0565\u0569\u0565 \u0561\u0576\u0563\u0561\u0574 \u0578\u0582\u0566\u0565\u0576\u0561\u0580 \u0567\u056c, \u0570\u0565\u0576\u0581 \u0569\u0565\u056f\u0578\u0582\u0566 \u0561\u0576\u056b\u0574\u0561\u057d\u057f\u0578\u0582\u0569\u0575\u0561\u0576 \u057a\u0561\u057f\u0573\u0561\u057c\u0578\u057e \u056b \u057e\u056b\u0573\u0561\u056f\u056b \u0579\u0567\u0580 \u056c\u056b\u0576\u056b \u0561\u0575\u0564 \u0562\u0561\u0576\u0576 \u0561\u0576\u0565\u056c:","Je ne peux pas me souvenir que tu m\'aies insult\xe9 personnellement, avec des insultesexplicites.

First the wall, therefore, and then the tower. His book was in everybody\'s hands at that time, but I admit that even today I cannot quite make out how he conceived this tower. How could the wall, which did not form even a circle, but only a sort of quarter- or half-circle, provide the foundation for a tower? That could obviously be meant only in a spiritual sense. But in that case why build the actual wall, which after all was something concrete, the result of the lifelong labor of multitudes of people? And why were there in the book plans, somewhat nebulous plans, it must be admitted, of the tower, and proposals worked out in detail for mobilizing the people\'s energies for the stupendous new work? There were many wild ideas in people\'s heads at that time -- this scholar\'s book is only one example -- perhaps simply because so many were trying to join forces as far as they could for the achievement of a single aim. Human nature, essentially changeable, unstable as the dust, can endure no restraint; if it binds itself it soon begins to tear madly at its bonds, until it rends everything asunder, the wall, the bonds, and its very self.","Wir brauchen B\xfccher, die auf uns wirken wie ein Ungl\xfcck, das uns sehr schmerzt, wie der Tod eines, den wir lieber h\xe4tten als uns, wie wenn wir in die W\xe4lder versto\xdfen w\xfcrden, von allen Menschen weg, ein Buch muss die Axt sein f\xfcr das gefrorene Meer in uns","Esa confusi\xf3n consiste en lo siguiente: mi felicidad, mis capacidades y toda posibilidad de que yo sea \xfatil de alguna manera est\xe1n desde siempre en la literatura.

If we were possessed by only a single devil, one who had a calm, untroubled view of our whole nature, and freedom to dispose of us at any moment, then that devil would also have enough power to hold us for the length of a human life high above the spirit of God in us, and even to swing us to and fro, so that we should never get to see a glimmer of it and therefore should not be troubled from that quarter. Only a crowd of devils could account for our earthly misfortunes. Why don\u2019t they exterminate one another until only a single one is left, or why don\u2019t they subordinate themselves to one great devil? Either way would be in accord with the diabolical principle of deceiving us as completely as possible. With unity lacking, of what use is the scrupulous attention all the devils pay us?
