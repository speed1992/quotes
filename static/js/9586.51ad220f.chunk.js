Sometimes they know us better than we know ourselves. With gentle honesty, they are there to guide and support us, to share our laughter and our tears. Their presence reminds us that we are never really alone.","Doing little things well is a step toward doing big things better.","I put my heart and my soul into my work, and have lost my mind in the process.","Love many things, for therein lies the true strength, and whosoever loves much performs much, and can accomplish much, and what is done in love is done well.","Find things beautiful as much as you can, most people find too little beautiful.","I try more and more to be myself, caring relatively little whether people approve or disapprove.","The heart of man is very much like the sea, it has its storms, it has its tides and in its depths it has its pearls too","I am always doing what I can\'t do yet in order to learn how to do it.","The more I think about it, the more I realize there is nothing more artistic than to love others.","Exaggerate the essential, leave the obvious vague.","Christ is more of an artist than the artists; he works in the living spirit and the living flesh, he makes men instead of statues.","The large majority of people are asleep and do not wish to wake up.","What would life be if we had no courage to attempt anything?","Everywhere we look, complex magic of nature blazes before our eyes.","Color in a picture is like enthusiasm in life.","The beginning is perhaps more difficult than anything else, but keep heart, it will turn out all right.","What is done in love is done well.","All art is a gift. It is first of all a gift that the maker can do it. It is then a gift to someone else, whether they pay for it or not. The wonder of it is that we cannot get the production of these gifts stopped. Art is life seeking itself. It is our intractable expressions of love for the beauties, ideas and epiphanies we regularly find. I framed the painting. It\'s now hanging in our den. \\"I have walked this earth for 30 years, and, out of gratitude, want to leave some souvenir.","In spite of everything, I shall rise again","Success is sometimes the outcome of a whole string of failures.","I never get tired of the blue sky.","If I am worth anything later, I am worth something now. For wheat is wheat, even if people think it is a grass in the beginning.","Many people seem to think it foolish, even superstitious, to believe that the world could still change for the better. And it is true that in winter it is sometimes so bitingly cold that one is tempted to say, \'What do I care if there is a summer; its warmth is no help to me now.\' Yes, evil often seems to surpass good. But then, in spite of us, and without our permission, there comes at last an end to the bitter frosts. One morning the wind turns, and there is a thaw. And so I must still have hope.","I long so much to make beautiful things. But beautiful things require effort and disappointment and perseverance.","Art is something greater and higher than our own skill or knowledge or learning. That art is something which, though produced by human hands, is not wrought by hands alone, but wells up from a deeper source, from a man\'s soul.","What am I in the eyes of most people - a nonentity, an eccentric, or an unpleasant person - somebody who has no position in society and will never have; in short, the lowest of the low. All right, then - even if that were absolutely true, then I should one day like to show by my work what such an eccentric, such a nobody, has in his heart.","The fishermen know that the sea is dangerous and the storm terrible, but they have never found these dangers sufficient reason for remaining ashore.","The more you love, the more you suffer.","For great things do not done just happen by impulse but are a succession of small things linked together.","There is peace even in the storm","Paintings have a life of their own that derives from the painter\'s soul.","If you end up falling in love with someone, it\'s because of them.  If you end up hating someone, it\'s because of you.","I dream of painting and then I paint my dream.","Yellow is capable of charming God.","I confess I do not know why, but looking at the stars always makes me dream.","It is only too true that a lot of artists are mentally ill - it\'s a life which, to put it mildly, makes one an outsider. I\'m all right when I completely immerse myself in work, but I\'ll always remain half crazy.","I can\'t change the fact that my paintings don\'t sell. But the time will come when people will recognize that they are worth more than the value of the paints used in the picture.","Try to walk as much as you can, and keep your love for nature, for that is the true way to learn to understand art more and more. Painters understand nature and love her and teach us to see her. If one really loves nature, one can find beauty everywhere.","One must never let the fire go out in one\'s soul, but keep it burning.","I often think that the night is more alive and more richly colored than the day.","But I always think that the best way to know God is to love many things.","Everyone who works with love and with intelligence finds in the very sincerity of his love for nature and art a kind of armor against the opinions of other people.","The only time I feel alive is when I\'m painting.","If one wants to be active, one must not be afraid of going wrong, one must not be afraid of making mistakes now and then. Many people think that they will become good just by doing no harm -- but that\'s a lie.... That way lies stagnation, mediocrity.","To suffer without complaint is the only lesson we have to learn in this life","There is no blue without yellow and without orange.","But you people do not understand me, and I am afraid you never will.","The great artist is the simplifier.","It is better to be high-spirited even though one makes more mistakes, than to be narrow-minded and all too prudent.","Conscience is a man\'s compass.","Do you know what makes the prison disappear? Every deep, genuine affection. Being friends, being brothers, loving, that is what opens the prison, with supreme power, by some magic force. Without these one stays dead. But whenever affection is revived, there life revives.","So often, a visit to a bookshop has cheered me, and reminded me that there are good things in the world.","You have first to experience what you want to express.","The sadness will last forever.","I want to paint what I feel, and feel what I paint.","...and then, I have nature and art and poetry, and if that is not enough, what is enough?","Whatever plan one makes, there is a hidden difficulty somewhere.","Only when I fall do I get up again.","I am an artist... It\'s self-evident that what that word implies is looking for something all the time without ever finding it in full. It is the opposite of saying, \'I know all about it. I\'ve already found it.\' As far as I\'m concerned, the word means, \'I am looking. I am hunting for it. I am deeply involved.\'","I am no friend of present-day Christianity, though its Founder was sublime.","Let\u2019s not forget that the little emotions are the great captains of our lives and we obey them without realizing it.","How lovely yellow is! It stands for the sun.","Keep your love of nature, for that is the true way to understand art more and more.","Love is eternal, the aspect may change, but not the essence. ","The sunflower is mine, in a way.","There is no such thing as an ugly woman.","It is the language of nature to which one has to listen.","The more I become decomposed, the more sick and fragile I am, the more I become an artist.","In my view, I am often immensely rich, not in money, but (although just now perhaps not all the time) rich because I have found my metier, something I can devote myself to heart and soul and that gives inspiration and meaning to my life.","Admire as much as you can. Most people do not admire enough.","The cypresses are always occupying my thoughts.","You have to first experience what you want to express","Though I am often in the depths of misery, there is still calmness, pure harmony and music inside me. I see paintings or drawings in the poorest cottages, in the dirtiest corners. And my mind is driven towards these things with an irresistible momentum.","Van Gogh was so under appreciated in his time, he sold only one of his 900 paintings while alive. Posthumously, he became one of the most famous artists of all time and his work is now considered priceless. Oh the irony.","One may have a blazing hearth in one\'s soul, and yet no one ever comes to sit by it.","I use color in a completely arbitrary way in order to express myself powerfully.","Love a friend, love a wife, something, whatever you like, but one must love with a lofty and serious intimate sympathy, with strength, with intelligence, and one must always try to know deeper, better, and more.","Poetry surrounds us everywhere, but putting it on paper is, alas, not so easy as looking at it.","I began to paint again, even though I could barely hold the brush, but knowing exactly what I wanted to paint, I began three more large canvases... of large wheat fields under cloudy skies, and it did not take a great deal to express sadness and loneliness... I believe these paintings say what words cannot.","I am a fanatic! I feel a power within me...a fire that I may not quench, but must keep ablaze.","At one time, the earth was supposed to be flat.  Well, so it is, even today, from Paris to Asnieres.  But that fact doesn\'t prevent science from proving that the earth as a whole is spherical.  No one nowadays denies it.  Well...we are still at the stage of believing that life itself is flat, the distance from birth to death.  Yet the probability is that life, too, is spherical and much more extensive and capacious than the hemisphere we know.","I want to touch people with my art. I want them to say \\"he feels deeply, he feels tenderly\\".","As practice makes perfect, I cannot but make progress; each drawing one makes, each study one paints, is a step forward.","Man is not on the earth solely for his own happiness. He is there to realize great things for humanity.","Someday death will take us to another star.","Love always brings difficulties, that is true, but the good side of it is that it gives energy.","The sight of stars makes me dream.","I must continue to follow the path I take now. If I do nothing, if I study nothing, if I cease searching, then, woe is me, I am lost. That is how I look at it - keep going, keep going come what may.","Art demands constant observation.","In an artist\'s life, death is perhaps not the most difficult thing.","If you study Japanese art you see a man who is undoubtedly wise, philosophic and intelligent, who spends his time how? In studying the distance between the earth and the moon? No. In studying the policy of Bismarck? No. He studies a single blade of grass. But this blade of grass leads him to draw every plant and then the seasons, the wide aspects of the countryside, then animals, then the human figure. So he passes his life, and life is too short to do the whole.","To know life, one must love many things.","Purity of soul and impurity of body can go together.","As we advance in life it becomes more and more difficult, but in fighting the difficulties the inmost strength of the heart is developed.","The diseases that we civilized people labor under most are melancholy and pessimism.","One must work and dare if one really wants to live.","We are surrounded by poetry on all sides.","The painter of the future will be a colorist unlike anything yet.","Art, although produced by man\'s hands, is something not created by hands alone, but something which wells up from a deeper source out of our soul.....My sympathies in the literary as well as in the artistic field are drawn most strongly to those artists in whom I see most the working of the soul.","Someone has a great fire in his soul and nobody ever comes to warm themselves at it, and passers-by see nothing but a little smoke at the top of the chimney and then go on their way.","If one is master of one thing and understands one thing well, one has at the same time, insight into and understanding of many things.","We spent our whole lives in unconsous excercise of the art of expressing our thoughts with the help of words","I want to get to the point where people say of my work, that man feels deeply.","If I succeed in putting some warmth and love into the work, then it will find friends. Carrying on working is the","Bookstores always remind me that there are good things in this world.","So let us go forward quietly, each on his own path, forever making for the light.","Describing Starry Night: Firmament and planets both disappeared, but the mighty breath which gives life to all things and in which all is bound up remained.","Painting is a faith, and it imposes the duty to disregard public opinion.","Love is something eternal.","It\'s as interesting and as difficult to say a thing well as to paint it. There is the art of lines and colours, but the art of words exists too, and will never be less important.","I take great care of myself by carefully shutting myself away.","We have very beautiful bad weather here at present - rain, wind, thunder - but with splendid effects; that\'s why I like it.","I hope I shall be able to make some drawings in which there is something human.","A woman is not old as long as she loves and is loved","One of the reasons why I have no regular job, and why I have not had a regular job for years, is quite simply that my ideas differ from those of the gentlemen who hand out the jobs to individuals who think as they do. It is not just a question of my appearance, which is what they have sanctimoniously reproached me with. It goes deeper, I do assure you.","It is looking at things for a long time that ripens you and gives you a deeper meaning.","I am risking my life for my work, and half my reason has gone.","But on the road that I\'m on I must continue; if I do nothing, if I don\'t study, if I don\'t keep on trying, then I\'m lost, then woe betide me. That\'s how I see this, to keep on, keep on, that\'s what\'s needed.","There is nothing more beautiful than nature early in the morning.","I would like to leave this world and never return. I severed my ear, but how I wish that I had severed my heart. I shall never amount to anything.","I cannot help thinking that the best way of knowing God is to love many things. Love this friend, this person, this thing, whatever you like, and you will be on the right road to understanding Him better.","When using colors to recreate a general harmony of tones in nature, one loses it by painfully exact imitation. One keeps it by recreating in an equivalent color range, and that may not be exactly, or far from exactly, like the model.","I\'ll start with small things.","A good picture is equivalent to a good deed.","I must continue to follow the path I take now. If I do nothing, if I study nothing, if I cease searching, then, woe is me, I am lost. That is how I look at it \u2014 keep going, keep going come what may. But what is your final goal, you may ask. That goal will become clearer, will emerge slowly but surely, much as the rough draught turns into a sketch, and the sketch into a painting through the serious work done on it, through the elaboration of the original vague idea and through the consolidation of the first fleeting and passing thought.","In spite of everything I shall rise again: I will take up my pencil, which I have forsaken in my great discouragement, and I will go on with my drawing.","Though I am often in the depths of misery, there is still calmness, pure harmony and music inside me.","Drawing is the root of everything.","I do not intend to spare myself, not to avoid emotions or difficulties. I don\'t care much whether I live a longer or shorter time... the world concerns me only in so far as I feel a certain debt toward it, because I have walked on this earth for thirty years, and out of gratitude I want to leave some souvenir.","At present I absolutely want to paint a starry sky. It often seems to me that night is still more richly coloured than the day; having hues of the most intense violets, blues and greens. If only you pay attention to it you will see that certain stars are lemon-yellow, others pink or a green, blue and forget-me-not brilliance. And without my expatiating on this theme it is obvious that putting little white dots on the blue-black is not enough to paint a starry sky.","If one feels the need of something grand, something infinite, something that makes one feel aware of God, one need not go far to find it.","For my part I know nothing with any certainty, but the sight of the stars makes me dream.","Just slap anything on when you see a blank canvas staring you in the face like some imbecile. You don\'t know how paralyzing that is, that stare of a blank canvas is, which says to the painter, \u2018You can\'t do a thing\u2019. The canvas has an idiotic stare and mesmerizes some painters so much that they turn into idiots themselves. Many painters are afraid in front of the blank canvas, but the blank canvas is afraid of the real, passionate painter who dares and who has broken the spell of `you can\'t\' once and for all.","My brushwork is quite unsystematic. I slam the paint on in all sorts of ways and leave each result to take care of itself.","I see more and more that my work goes infinitely better when I am properly fed, and the paints are there, and the studio and all that... I wish I could manage to make you really understand that when you give money to artists, you are yourself doing an artist\'s work, and that I only want my pictures to be of such a quality that you will not be too dissatisfied with your work.","Still, there is a calm, pure harmony, and music inside of me.","It is not only by one\'s impulses that one achieves greatness, but also by patiently filing away the steel wall that separates what one feels from what one is capable of doing.","What a simple thing death is, just as simple as the falling of an autumn leaf.","But you must love with a sublime , genuine , profound sympathy , with devotion, with intelligence , and you must try all the time to understand Him more, better and yet more. That will lead to God , that will lead to an unshakeable faith .","One of the hardest things to do is to paint darkness which nonetheless has light in it.","Sometimes art seems to be something very sublime, and, as you say, something sacred.","Conscience is a man\'s compass, and though the needle sometimes deviates, though one often perceives irregularities in directing one\'s course by it, still one must try to follow its direction.","The world concerns me only in so far as I feel a certain indebtedness and duty toward it because I have walked this earth for thirty years, and, out of gratitude, want to leave some souvenir in the shape of drawings or pictures \u2014 not made to please a certain taste in art, but to express a sincere human feeling.","Be clearly aware of the stars and infinity on high. Then life seems almost enchanted after all.","Rembrandt is so deeply mysterious that he says things for which there are no words in any language.","Suffice it to say that black and white are also colors... for their simultaneous contrast is as striking as that of green and red, for instance.","If only we try to live sincerely, it will go well with us, even though we are certain to experience real sorrow, and great disappointments, and also will probably commit great faults and do wrong things, but it certainly is true, thatit is better to be high-spirited, even though one makes more mistakes, than to be narrow-minded and all too prudent. It is good to love many things, for therein lies the true strength, and whosoever loves much performs much, and can accomplish much, and what is done in love, is well done.","One can speak poetry just by arranging colors well, just as one can say comforting things in music.","It astonishes me already when I compare my condition today with what it was a month ago. Before that I knew well enough one could fracture one\'s legs and arms and recover afterward, but I did not know that you could fracture the brain in your head and recover from that too.","I sometimes think there is nothing so delightful as drawing.","Often whole days pass without my speaking to anyone, except to ask for diner or coffee. And it has been like that form the beginning.","Love always causes trouble, that\'s true, but in its favour, it energizes.","Do not think too deeply about these things - gradually they will become clearer to you","I shouldn\'t precisely have chosen madness if there had been any choice, but once such a thing has taken hold of you, you can\'t very well get out of it.","Great things are not something accidental, but must certainly be willed.","I wish they would take me as I am.","In the end we shall have had enough of cynicism, skepticism and humbug, and we shall want to live more musically.","Here everything is so wholly what I consider beautiful. In other words, there is peace here.","The emotions are sometimes so strong that I work without knowing it. The strokes come like speech.","There are colors which cause each other to shine brilliantly, which form a couple which complete each other like man and woman.","At times it is not easy for me to take up living again.","To die for the sake of dying - I prefer to die of passion than to die of boredom!","Let us keep courage and try to be patient and gentle. And let us not mind being eccentric, and make distinction between good and evil.","But I must work on in full calmness and serenity... The world concerns me only in so far as I feel a certain debt and duty towards it, because I have walked on the earth for thirty years, and out of gratitude want to leave some souvenir in the shape of drawings or pictures, not made to please a certain tendency in art, but to express a sincere human feeling. So this work is the aim-and through concentration upon that one idea, everything one does is simplified. Now the work goes slowly-a reason the more to lose no time.","How can I be useful, of what service can I be? There is something inside me, what can it be?","Perhaps someday everyone will have neurosis.","One must spoil as many canvases as one succeeds with.","No, no thought to the winnings. One loves because one loves.","To stick to the present and not let it pass without drawing some profit from it, that\'s what I think duty is. ...let us perservere as far as we can rather today than tomorrow.","I don\'t know anything with certainty, but seeing the stars makes me dream.","The great things are not done by impulse, but by a series of small things brought together. And great things are not something accidental, but must certainly be willed.","If one hasn\'t a horse, one is one\'s own horse.","...to look at the stars always makes me dream, as simply as I dream over the black dots of a map representing towns and villages. Why, I ask myself, should the shining dots of the sky not be as accessible as the black dots on the map of France?","I experience a period of frightening clarity in those moments when nature is so beautiful. I am no longer sure of myself, and the paintings appear as in a dream.","My sketchbook is a witness of what I am experiencing, scribbling things whenever they happen.","Accurate drawing, accurate colour, is perhaps not the essential thing to aim at, because the reflection of reality in a mirror, if it could be caught, colour and all, would not be a picture at all, no more than a photograph.","I am unable to describe exactly what is the matter with me; now and then there are horrible fits of anxiety, apparently without cause, or otherwise a feeling of emptiness and fatigue in the head.","But for one\'s health as you say, it is very necessary to work in the garden and see the flowers growing.","I tried to express through red and green the terrible passions of humanity.","Painting is like having a bad mistress who spends and spends and it\'s never enough ... I tell myself that even if a tolerable study comes out of it from time to time, it would have been cheaper to buy it from somebody else.","Ah! Portraiture, portraiture with the thought, the soul of the model in it, that is what I think must come.","I wanted to make people think of a totally different way of living from that which we, educated people, live. I would absolutely not want anyone to find it beautiful or good without a thought.","I believe that it may happen that one will succeed, and one must not begin to despair, even though defeated here and there; and even though one sometimes feels a kind of decay, though things go differently from the expected, it is necessary to take heart again and new courage. For the great things are not done by impulse, but by a series of small things brought together. And great things are not something accidental, but must certainly be willed. What is drawing? How does one learn it? It is working through an invisible iron wall that seems to stand between what one feels and what one can do.","I always think photographs abominable, and I don\'t like to have them around, particularly not those of persons I know and love. Those photographic portraits wither much sooner than we ourselves do, whereas the painted portrait is a thing which is felt, done with love.","I am a man of passions, capable of and subject to doing more or less foolish things- which I happen to regret, more or less, afterwards.","Spring is the fresh green of young corn and the pink blush of blossoms. Autumn contrasts the yellowed foilage with violet hues. Winter is the white of snow against its black forms ... Summer is the contrast of blues and the golden bronze of the corn.","And painted portraits have a life of their own that comes from deep in the soul of the painter and where the machine can\'t go.","If one feels the need of something grand, something infinite, something that makes one feel aware of God, one need not go far to find it. I think that I see something deeper, more infinite, more eternal than the ocean in the expression of the eyes of a little baby when it wakes in the morning and coos or laughs because it sees the sun shining on its cradle.","Often whole days pass without my speaking to anyone.","I believe more and more that God must not be judged on this earth. It is one of His sketches that has turned out badly.","I am still far from being what I want to be, but with God\'s help I shall succeed.","Both she and I have grief enough and trouble enough, but as for regrets \u2013 neither of us have any.","Occasionally, in times of worry, I\'ve longed to be stylish, but on second thought I say no-just let me be myself-and express rough, yet true things with rough workmanship.","To do good work one must eat well, be well housed, have one\'s fling from time to time, smoke one\'s pipe, and drink one\'s coffee in peace","It is with the reading of books the same as with looking at pictures; one must, without doubt, without hesitations, with assurance, admire what is beautiful.","For the great doesn\'t happen through impulse alone, and is a succession of little things that are brought together.","To express the love of two lovers by a marriage of two complementary colors, their mingling and their opposition, the mysterious vibrations of Kindred tones. To express the thought of a brow by the radiance of light tone against a somber background; to express hope by some star, the eagerness of a soul by a sunset radiance.","As long as autumn lasts, I shall not have hands, canvas and colors enough to paint the beautiful things I see.","How rich art is, if one can only remember what one has seen, one is never empty of thoughts or truly lonely, never alone.","The Mediterranean has the color of mackerel, changeable I mean. You don\'t always know if it is green or violet, you can\'t even say it\'s blue, because the next moment the changing reflection has taken on a tint of rose or gray.","To believe in God for me is to feel that there is a God, not a dead one, or a stuffed one, who with irresistible force urges us towards more loving.","When I have a terrible need of - shall I say the word - religion. Then I go out and paint the stars.","In trees, I see expression and soul","What molting time is to birds, so adversity or misfortune is ... for us humans.","One may have a blazing hearth in one\'s soul and yet no one ever came to sit by it. Passers-by see only a wisp of smoke from the chimney and continue on their way.","I want to paint men and women with that something of the external which the halo used to symbolize, and which we now seek to give by the actual radiance and vibrancy of our colorings.","What has changed is that my life then was less difficult and my future seemingly less gloomy, but as far as my inner self, my way of looking at things and of thinking is concerned, that has not changed. But if there has indeed been a change, then it is that I think, believe and love more seriously now what I thought, believed and loved even then.","In general, and most especially with artists, I pay as much attention to the man who does the work, as to the work itself.","I\'ve never felt a desire (and I don\'t believe I ever shall) to bring the public to my work... a certain popularity seems to me the least desirable of things.","There is a sun, a light that for want of another word I can only call yellow, pale sulphur yellow, pale golden citron. How lovely yellow is!","I work as diligently on my canvases as the laborers do in their fields.","It is not the language of painters but the language of nature which one should listen to, the feeling for the things themselves, for reality is more important than the feeling for pictures.","I lost my job as an art salesman. It was the customer\'s fault. He wanted to buy the wrong paintings.","The only thing to do is to go one\'s own way, to try one\'s best, to make the thing live.","I\'m now painting with all the elan of a Marseillais eating soup, which won\'t surprise you when I tell you I\'m painting large sunflowers. The idea? To decorate the studio, now there\'s hope of Gauguin living here. I aim at a dozen panels of sunflowers in the room I\'ve set aside for Gauguin.","What I need is courage, and this often fails me. And it is also a fact that since my disease, when I am in the fields I am overwhelmed by a feeling of loneliness to such a horrible extent that I shy away from going out. But this will change all the same as time goes on. Only when I stand a painting before my easel do I feel somewhat alive. Never mind, this is going to change too, for now my health is so good that I suppose the physical part of me will gain the victory.","To express a marriage of two complementary colors, their mingling and their opposition, the mysterious vibrations of kindred tones.","Christ alone, of all the philosophers, magicians, etc., has affirmed eternal life as the most important certainty, the infinity of time, the futility of death, the necessity and purpose of serenity and devotion. He lived serenely, as an artist greater than all other artists, scorning marble and clay and paint, working in the living flesh. In other words, this peerless artist, scarcely conceivable with the blunt instrument of our modern, nervous and obtuse brains, made neither statues nor paintings nor books. He maintained in no uncertain terms that he made ... living men, immortals.","I consciously choose the dog\'s path through life. I shall be poor; I shall be a painter.","I feel such a creative force in me: I am convinced that there will be a time when, let us say, I will make something good every day , on a regular basis....I am doing my very best to make every effort because I am longing so much to make beautiful things. But beautiful things mean painstaking work, disappointment, and perseverance.","I am not an adventurer by choice but by fate.","Do not become the slave of your model.","For instead of trying to reproduce exactly what I see before me, I make more arbitrary use of colour to express myself more forcefully.","No blue without yellow and without orange, and if you do blue, then do yellow and orange as well, surely.","... life is too short to do the whole.","I do not know myself how I paint it. I sit down with a white board before the spot that strikes me. I look at what is before my eyes, and say to myself, that white board must become something.","I am not strictly speaking mad, for my mind is absolutely normal in the intervals, and even more so than before. But during the attacks it is terrible - and then I lose consciousness of everything. But that spurs me on to work and to seriousness, as a miner who is always in danger makes haste in what he does.","Since visiting the abatoirs of S. France I have stopped eating meat.","It is good to love many things","Gauguin says that when sailors have to move a heavy load or raise an anchor, they all sing together to keep them up and give them vim. That\'s just what artists lack!","If one keeps loving faithfully what is really worth loving, and does not waste one\'s love on insignificant and unworthy and meaningless things, one will get more light by and by and grow stronger.","I am painting with the same enthusiasm as a Marseillaise eats bouillabaisse ... I am painting big sunflowers.","Seek only light and freedom and do not immerse yourself too deeply in the worldly mire.","I assure you that there\'s a lot involved in compositions with figures. ... It\'s like weaving... you must control and keep an eye on several things at once.","I feel the need of relations and friendship, of affection, of friendly intercourse.... I cannot miss these things without feeling, as does any other intelligent man, a void and a deep need.","I\'ve just kept on ceaselessly painting in order to learn painting.","l can do very well without God both in my life and in my painting, but l cannot, ill as I am, do without something which is greater than l, which is my life \u2014 the power to create.","Painters understand nature and love it, and teach us to see.","One must learn to read, just as one must learn to see and learn to live.","There is but one Paris and however hard living may be here, and if it became worse and harder even\u2014the French air clears up the brain and does good\u2014a world of good.","The worse I get along with people the more I learn to have faith in Nature and concentrate on her.","I am always in the hope to express the love of two lovers by a marriage of two complementary colors - colors which marry each other... complement each other as a man and a woman do.","You can\'t be at the pole and the equator at the same time. You must choose your own line, as I hope to do, and it will probably be color.","The wheat field has ...poetry; it is like a memory of something one has once seen. We can only make our pictures speak.","What am I in most people\'s eyes? A nonentity or an eccentric and disagreeable man... I should want my work to show what is in the heart of such an eccentric, of such a nobody.","If I were to think of and dwell on disastrous possibilities, I could do nothing. I throw myself headlong into my work, and come up again with my studies.","To the one party, woman is always heresy and diabolical. To me, the opposite.","I will not live without love.","You can feel the stars and the infinity of the sky since life, in spite of everything, is like a dream.","I am astonished at the high prices paid for works by painters who are dead, prices none of them could expect when they were alive. It is a kind of tulip trade, in which living painters suffer but do not profit.","It always strikes me, and it is very peculiar, that, whenever we see the image of indescribable and unutterable desolation\u2014of loneliness, poverty, and misery, the end and extreme of things\u2014the thought of God comes into one\'s mind.","A weaver who has to direct and to interweave a great many little threads has no time to philosophize about it, but rather he is so absorbed in his work that he doesn\'t think but acts, and he feels how things must go more than he can explain it.","It interests me tremendously to make copies... I started it by chance and I find it teaches me things.","Painting as it is now promises to become more subtle - more like music and less like sculpture - and above all it promises color. If only it keeps this promise.","There are so many people, especially among our comrades, who imagine that words are nothing - on the contrary, isn\'t it true that saying a thing well is as interesting and as difficult as painting it?","In order to work and to become an artist one needs love. At least, one who wants sentiment in his work must in the first place feel it himself, and live with his heart","But what\'s your ultimate goal, you\'ll say. That goal will become clearer, will take shape slowly and surely, as the croquis becomes a sketch and the sketch a painting, as one works more seriously, as one digs deeper into the originally vague idea, the first fugitive, passing thought, unless it becomes firm.","Art is jealous, and demands our whole strength ... .","If the storm within gets too loud, I take a glass too much to stun myself.","And love makes one calmer about many things, and in that way, one is more fit for one\'s work.","One can never study nature too much and too hard","An artist needn\'t be a clergyman or a churchwarden, but he certainly must have a warm heart for his fellow men.","What color is in a picture, enthusiasm is in life.","It constantly remains a source of disappointment to me that my drawings are not yet what I want them to be. The difficulties are indeed numerous and great, and cannot be overcome at once. To make progress is a kind of miner\u2019s work; it doesn\u2019t advance as quickly as one would like, and as others also expect, but as one stands before such a task, the basic necessities are patience and faithfulness. In fact, I do not think much about the difficulties, because if one thought of them too much one would get stunned or disturbed.","We take death to reach a star","To try to understand the real significance of what the great artists, the serious masters, tell us in their masterpieces, that leads to God; one man wrote or told it in a book; another, in a picture.","And when I read, and really I do not read so much, only a few authors, - a few men that I discovered by accident - I do this because they look at things in a broader, milder and more affectionate way than I do, and because they know life better, so that I can learn from them.","It was Richepin who said somewhere, \'The love of art means loss of real love\'... True, but on the other hand, real love makes you disgusted with art.","I think that I still have it in my heart someday to paint a bookshop with the front yellow and pink in the evening...like a light in the midst of the darkness.","What preys on my mind is simply this one question: what am I good for, could I not be of service or use in some way?","I felt my energy return and that I said to myself, in any event I\'ll recover from it, I\'ll pick up my pencil that I put down in my great discouragement and I\'ll get back to drawing, and from then on, it seems to me, everything has changed for me.","In a sense I\'m glad that I\'ve never learned how to paint.","My opinion is that the best thing would be to work on till art lovers feel drawn toward it of their own accord, instead of having to praise or to explain it.","I devour nature ceaselessly. I exaggerate, sometimes I make changes in the subject; but still I don\'t invent the whole picture. On the contrary, I find it already there. It\'s a question of picking out what one wants from nature.","I often think of you all, one cannot do what one wants in life. The more you feel attached to a spot, the more ruthlessly you are compelled to leave it, but the memories remain, and one remembers - as in a looking glass, darkly - one\'s absent friends.","Well, do you know what I hope for, once I allow myself to begin to hope? [...] That you find in your love for people something not only to work for, but to comfort and restore you when there is a need.","The thing has already taken form in my mind before I start it. The first attempts are absolutely unbearable. I say this because I want you to know that if you see something worthwhile in what I am doing, it is not by accident but because of real direction and purpose.","Even the knowledge of my own fallibility cannot keep me from making mistakes. Only when I fall do I get up again.","Surely the true path is to dive deep into nature.","Let life be beautiful like summer flowers and death be like autumn leaves. Rabindranath Tagore What a simple thing death is, just as simple as the falling of an autumn leaf.","I know for sure that I have an instinct for color, and that it will come to me more and more, that painting is in the very marrow of my bones.","It is true that every day has its own evil, and its good too. But how difficult must life be, especially farther on when the evil of each day increases as far as worldly things go, if it is not strengthened and comforted by faith. And in Christ all worldly things may become better, and, as it were, sanctified. Theo, woe is me if I do not preach the Gospel; if I did not aim at that and possess faith and hope in Christ, it would be bad for me indeed, but no I have some courage.","To paint nature you must be in it a long time.","I see drawings and pictures in the poorest huts, in the dirtiest corner. And my mind is drawn toward these things by an irresistible force.","As you can see, I am immersing myself in color-I\'ve held back from that until now; and I don\'t regret it.","The uglier, older, meaner, iller, poorer I get, the more I wish to take my revenge by doing brilliant color, well arranged, resplendent.","I want to do drawings which touch some people... In either figure or landscape I wish to express, not sentimental melancholy, but serious sorrow.","Do not quench your inspiration and your imagination; do not become the slave of your model.","We feel lonely now and then and long for friends and think we should be quite different and happier if we found a friend of whom we might say: \u201cHe is the one.\u201d But you, too, will begin to learn that there is much self-deception behind this longing; if we yielded too much to it, it would lead us from the road.","What is drawing? It is working oneself through an invisible iron wall that seems to stand between what one feels and what one can do.","But by fighting the difficulties in which one finds oneself, an inner strength develops from within our heart, which improves in life\'s fight.","Of course my moods change, but the average is serenity. I have a firm faith in art, a firm confidence in its being a powerful stream which carries a man to a harbor, though he himself must do his bit too; at all events, I think it such a great blessing when a man has found his work that I cannot count myself among the unfortunate. I mean, I may be in certain relatively great difficulties, and there may be gloomy days in my life, but I shouldn\'t like to be counted among the unfortunate, nor would it be correct if I were.","The sight of stars always sets me dreaming just as naively as those black dots on a map set me dreaming of towns and villages. Why should these points of light in the firmament, I wonder, be less accessible than the dark ones on the map of France? We take a train to go to Torascon or Roven and we take death to a star.","People are often unable to do anything, imprisoned as they are in I don\'t know what kind of terrible, terrible, oh such terrible cage.","The more ugly, old, nasty, ill, and poor I become the more I want to get my own back by producing vibrant, well-arranged, radiant colour.","There is the same difference in a person before and after he is in love, as there is in an unlighted lamp and one that is burning.","You know, what makes the prison disappear is every deep, serious attachment. To be friends, to be brothers, to love; that opens the prison through sovereign power, through a most powerful spell. But he who doesn\'t have that remains in death. But where sympathy springs up again, life springs up again.","One should arrive at leading one\'s conscience to a state of development so that it becomes the voice of a better and higher self, of which the ordinary self is a servant.","Let me stop there, but my God, how beautiful Shakespeare is, who else is as mysterious as he is; his language and method are like a brush trembling with excitement and ecstasy. But one must learn to read, just as one must learn to see and learn to live.","Life itself, too, is forever turning an infinitely vacant, dispiriting blank side towards man on which nothing appears, any more than it does on a blank canvas. But no matter how vacant and vain, how dead life may appear to be, the man of faith, of energy, of warmth, who knows something, will not be put off so easily.","When we are working at a difficult task and strive after a good thing, we are fighting a righteous battle, the direct reward of which is that we are kept from much evil.","I had a new idea in my head... this time it\'s just simply my bedroom, only here colour is to do everything, and, giving by its simplification a grander style to things, is to be suggestive here of rest or of sleep in general. In a word, to look at the picture ought to rest the brain or rather the imagination.","What a splendid thing watercolour is to express atmosphere and distance, so that the figure is surrounded by air and can breathe in it.","It is no more easy to make a good picture than it is to find a diamond or a pearl. It means trouble and you risk your life for it.","It isn\'t an easy job to paint oneself - at any rate if it is to be different from a photograph. And you see - this, in my opinion, is the advantage that impressionism possesses over all the other things; it is not banal, and one seeks after a deeper resemblance than the photograph.","Oh! I must somehow manage to do a figure in a few strokes.","Many painters are afraid of the blank canvas, but the blank canvas is afraid of the truly passionate painter who dares-and who has once broken the spell of \'you can\'t.\'","When we are working at a difficult task and strive after a good thing, we are fighting a righteous battle, the direct reward of which is that we are kept from much evil. As we advance in life it becomes more and more difficult, but in fighting the difficulties the inmost strength of the heart is developed.","Sometimes I long so much to do landscape, just as one would go for a long walk to refresh oneself, and in all of nature, in trees for instance, I see expression and a soul.","If you work with love and intelligence, you develop a kind of armour against people\'s opinions, just because of the sincerity of your love for nature and art. Nature is also severe and, to put it that way, hard, but never deceives and always helps you to move forward.","As a painter I shall never signify anything of importance. I feel it Absolutely.","The great isn\'t something accidental; it must be willed.","What is drawing? How does one get there? It\'s working one\'s way through an invisible iron wall that seems to stand between what one feels and what one can do. How can one get through that wall? - since hammering on it doesn\'t help at all. In my view, one must undermine the wall and grind through it slowly and patiently.","Modern reality has got such a hold on us that... when we attempt to reconstruct the ancient days in our thoughts...the minor events of our lives tear us away from our meditations, and... thrust us back into our personal [problems]","And in a picture I want to say something comforting, as music is comforting.","Ideas for work are coming to me in abundance...I\'m going like a painting-locomotive.","I can\'t work without a model. I won\'t say I turn my back on nature ruthlessly in order to turn a study into a picture, arranging the colors, enlarging and simplifying; but in the matter of form I am too afraid of departing from the possible and the true.","Nature always begins by resisting the artist, but he who really takes it seriously does not allow that resistance to put him off his stride; on the contrary, it is that much more of a stimulus to fight for victory.","The laws of the colors are unutterably beautiful, just because they are not accidental.","Painting demands an intelligent model.","Ah, Manet has come very, very close to it and Courbet - the marrying of form and colour.","It is difficult to know oneself, but it isn\'t easy to paint oneself either.","How to achieve such anomalies, such alterations and re-fashionings of reality so what comes out of it are lies, if you like, but lies that are more than literal truth.","The majority of (painters), because they aren\'t colorists, do not see yellow, orange or sulphur in the South (of France) and they call a painter mad if he sees with eyes other than theirs","How right it is to love flowers and the greenery of pines and ivy and hawthorn hedges; they have been with us from the very beginning.","To express hope by some star, the eagerness of a soul by a sunset radiance. Certainly there is nothing in that of stereoscopic realism, but is it not something that actually exists?","My great longing is to make those very incorrectnesses, those deviations, remodellings, changes in reality, so that they may become, yes, lies if you like - but truer than the literal truth.","The victory one would gain after a whole life of work and effort is better than one that is gained sooner.","I myself am quite absorbed by the delicate yellow, delicate soft green, delicate violet of a ploughed and weeded piece of soil.","The best pictures are always those one dreams of when one is smoking a pipe in bed, but which never get done. But still one ought to try, however incompetent one may feel before the unspeakable perfection and radiant splendour of nature.","I have played hell somewhat with the truthfulness of the colours.","It must be a good thing to die conscious of having performed some real good, and to know that by this work one will live, at least in the memory of some, and will have left a good example to those that come after. A work that is good-it may not be eternal, but the thought expressed in it is, and the work itself will certainly remain in existence for a long, long time; and if afterwards others arise, they can do no better than follow in the footsteps of such predecessors and do their work in the same way.","There is something intimate about painting I cannot explain to you ? but it is so delightful just for expressing one\'s feelings.","An artist need not be a minister or a collector in church, but he must have a warm heart for people, and I find it a noble thing that, for example, no winter passed without The Graphic doing something to keep alive sympathy for the poor.","Life is not long for anybody, and the problem is only to make something of it.","If your inner voice is telling you that you can\'t paint, by all means, hurry up and paint and silence the voice.","God sends us pieces of art so that we may see ourselves in them","I work even in the middle of the day, in the full sunshine, and I enjoy it like a cicada.","I feel a certain calm. There is safety in the midst of danger. What would life be if we had no courage to attempt anything?","If we study Japanese art, we see a man who is undoubtedly wise, philosophic and intelligent, who spends his time doing what?  He studies a single blade of grass.","Well, I am ploughing on my canvases as they do on their fields (the peasants). It goes badly enough in our profession - in fact that has always been so, but at the moment it is very bad.","Whoever lives sincerely and encounters much trouble and disappointment without being bowed down is worth more than one who has always sailed before the wind and has only known prosperity.","There certainly is an affinity between a person and his work, but it is not easy to define what this affinity is, and on that question many judge quite wrongly.","Love is eternal -- the aspect may change, but not the essence. There is the same difference in a person before and after he is in love as there is in an unlighted lamp and one that is burning. The lamp was there and was a good lamp, but now it is shedding light too, and that is its real function. And love makes one calmer about many things, and that way, one is more fit for one\'s work.","What lives in art and is eternally living, is first of all the painter and then the painting.","Even this artistic life, which we know is not real life, appears to me to be so alive and so vital that it would be a form ingratitude not to be content with it.","The lamps are burning and the starry sky is over it all.","The more ugly, older, more cantankerous, more ill and poorer I become, the more I try to make amends by making my colours more vibrant, more balanced and beaming.","Just dash something down if you see a blank canvas staring at you with a certain imbecility. You do not know how paralyzing it is, that staring of a blank canvas which says to the painter: you don\'t know anything.","If boyhood and youth are but vanity, must it not be our ambition to become men?","a likeness different from the products of the God-fearing photographer.","It is the painting that makes me so happy these days.","There may be a time in life when one is tired of everything and feels as if all one does is wrong, and there maybe some truth in it- do you think this is a feeling one must try to forget and to banish, or is it \'the longing for God,\' which one must not fear, but cherish to see if it may bring us some good? Is it \'the longing for God\' which leads us to make a choice which we never regret? Let us keep courage and try to be patient and gentle. And not mind being eccentric, and make distinction between good and evil.","What is true is that I have at times earned my own crust of bread, and at other times a friend has given it to me out of the goodness of his heart. I have lived whatever way I could, for better or for worse, taking things just as they came.","By working hard, old man, I hope to make something good one day. I haven\'t yet, but I am pursuing it and fighting for it . . . .","Do you know that drawing with words is also an art... ?","Art is but imitation of nature.","It is a pity that, as one gradually gains experience, one loses one\'s youth.","Don\'t lose heart if it\'s very difficult at times, everything will come out all right and nobody can in the beginning do as he wishes.","That I was not suited to commerce or academic study in no way proves that I should also be unfit to be a painter.","It seems to me it\'s a painter\'s duty to try to put an idea into his work.","For me work is an absolute necessity, indeed I can\'t really drag it out, I take no more pleasure in anything than in work, that\'s to say, pleasure in other things stops immediately and I become melancholy if I can\'t get on with the work.","If you work diligently... without saying to yourself beforehand, \'I want to make this or that,\' if you work as though you were making a pair of shoes, without artistic preoccupation, you will not always find you do well. But the days you least expect it, you will find a subject which holds its own with the work of those who have gone before.","Ah! My dear friend painting is to us what the music of Berlioz and Wagner was before us - a consolatory art for sore hearts! And yet there are only a few like you and me who feel it!!!","There was a sentence in your letter that struck me, \u201cI wish I were far away from everything, I am the cause of all, and bring only sorrow to everybody, I alone have brought all this misery on myself and others.\u201d These words struck me because that same feeling, just the same, not more nor less, is also on my conscience.","But after all I find in my work an echo of what struck me. I see that nature has told me something, has spoken to me, and that I have put it down in shorthand. In my shorthand there may be words that cannot be deciphered. There may be mistakes or gap","Cobalt is a divine color and there is nothing as fine for putting an atmosphere round things. Carmine is the red of wine and is warm and lively like wine. The same goes for emerald green too. It\'s false economy to dispense with them, with those colors. Cadmium as well.","I believe it is one\'s duty to paint the rich and magnificent aspects of nature. We need gaiety and happiness, hope and love.","If I did not succeed I still thought that what I had worked on would be continued. Not immediately. But there are others who believe in things that are true.","I have a firm faith in art, a firm confidence in its being a powerful stream which carries a man to a harbor, though he himself must do his bit too.","When I have a model who is quiet and steady and with whom I am acquainted, then I draw repeatedly \'til there is one drawing that is different from the rest, which does not look like an ordinary study, but more typical and with more feeling.","Those Dutchmen had hardly any imagination or fantasy, but their good taste and their scientific knowledge of composition were enormous.","It\'s better to have a gay life of it than to commit suicide.","Fortunately for me, I know well enough what I want, and am basically utterly indifferent to the criticism that I work to hurriedly. In answer to that, I have done some things even more hurriedly theses last few days.","Painting it was hard graft. There are one and a half large tubes of white in the ground - yet that ground is very dark.","I don\'t know if I can convey the postman as I feel him... Unfortunately he cannot pose, and a painting demands an intelligent model.","Painting is a faith and that it brings with it the duty to pay no heed to public opinion - and that in it one conquers by perseverance and not by giving in.","To exaggerate the fairness of hair, I come even to orange tones, chromes and pale yellow ... I make a plain background of the richest, intensest blue that I can contrive, and by this simple combination of the bright head against the rich blue background, I get a mysterious effect, like a star in the depths of an azure sky.","The world concerns me only in so far as I have a certain debt and duty to it, because I have lived in it for thirty years and owe to it to leave behind some souvenir in the shape of drawings and paintings \u2013 not done to please any particular movement, but within which a genuine human sentiment is expressed.","You will say that everyone has seen landscapes and figures from childhood on. The question is: Has everybody also been reflexive as a child? Has everybody who has seen them also loved heath, fields, meadows, woods, and the snow and the rain and the s.","A good painting should be the equivalent of a good deed.","That this awareness of my own fallibility will prevent me from making many mistakes doesn\'t alter the fact that I\'m bound to make a great many mistakes anyway. But if we fall, we get up again!","I was certainly going the right way for a stroke when I left Paris. I paid for it nicely afterwards! When I stopped drinking, when I stopped smoking so much, when I began to think again instead of trying not to think - Good Lord, the depression and the prostration of it! Work in these magnificent natural surroundings (Arles) has restored my morale, but even now some efforts are too much for me: my strength fails me.","One begins by plaguing oneself to no purpose in order to be true to nature, and one concludes by working quietly from one\'s own palette alone, and then nature is the result.","Art demands persistent work, work in spite of everything, and continuous observations. By persistent, I mean not only continuous work, but also not giving up your opinion at the bidding of such and such a person.","Just slap something on it when you see a blank canvas staring at you with a sort of imbecility.","My aim in life is to make pictures and drawings, as many and as well as I can; then, at the end of my life... looking back with love and tender regret, and thinking, \'Oh, the pictures I might have made!\'","I am working with the enthusiasm of a man from Marseilles eating bouillabaisse, which shouldn\'t come as a surprise to you because I am busy painting huge sunflowers.","We are having wind and rain here, and I am very glad not to be alone. I work from memory on bad days, and that would not do if I were alone.","I believe I do much better for the time being by first copying some good things than by working without that foundation","For loneliness, worries, difficulties, the unsatisfied need for kindness and sympathy - that is what is hard to bear.","Well, I dare not allow myself any illusions, and I am afraid it may never happen that Father and Mother will really appreciate my art. It is not their fault; we do not see the same things with the same eyes, or have the same thoughts raised in us by them. They will never be able to understand what painting is.","In the fullness of artistic life there is, and remains, and will always come back at times, that homesick longing for the truly ideal life that can never come true.","The canvas has an idiotic stare and mesmerises some painters so much that they turn into idiots themselves.","I myself believe that there is in every painter\'s life a period of making absurdities. In my case I think that period is already long past.","Study, analyse the social structure - that\'s always far more effective than moralising.","To save a life is a real and beautiful thing. To make a home for the homeless, yes, it is a thing that must be good; whatever the world may say, it cannot be wrong.","We must not judge God from this world. It\'s just a study that didn\'t come off. It\'s only a master who could make such a blunder.","If one were to say but few words, though ones with meaning, one would do better than to say many that were only empty sounds, and just as easy to utter as they were of little use.","It may be true that there is no God here, but there must be one not far off, and at such a moment one feels His presence; which comes to the same as saying (and I readily give this sincere profession of faith): I believe in God, and that it is His wi","There is no blue without yellow and without orange, and if you put in blue, then you must put in yellow, and orange too, mustn\'t you? Oh well, you will tell me that what I write to you are only banalities.","I believe that one thinks much more soundly if the thoughts arise from direct contact with things, than if one looks at things with the aim of finding this or that in them.","Painting it was hard graft... in addition red, yellow, brown ochre, black, terra sienna, bistre, and the result is a red-brown that varies from bistre to deep wine-red and to pale, blond reddish.","If one has such an encounter it is to be expected it will bring him into conflict, especially conflict with himself, because one sometimes literally does not know what to do or what not to do. But is this struggle and even the mistakes one may make, not better, and do they not develop us more than if we keep systematically away from emotions?","I always dream a painting like that, with a group of lively figures of the pals.","Drawing is the root of everything, and the time spent on that is actually all profit.","For myself, I declare I don\'t know anything about it. But the sight of the stars always makes me dream.","Seeing that I am so busily occupied with myself just now, I want to try to paint my self-portrait in writing.","It is a sad and very melancholy scene, which must strike everyone who knows and feels that we also have to pass one day through the valley of the shadow of death, and \u201cque la fin de la vie humaine, ce sont des larmes ou des cheveux blancs.\u201d What lies beyond this is a great mystery that only God knows, but He has revealed absolutely through His word that there is a resurrection of the dead.","The cure for him would be to take a good long look at some potato plants, which have lately had such a deep and distinctive colour and tone, instead of driving himself mad looking at pieces of yellow satin and gold leather.","It is good to love many things, for therein lies the true strength, and whosoever loves much performs much, and can accomplish much, and what is done in love is well done.","I dream my painting and I paint my dream.","There is nothing more truly artistic than to love people.","A great fire burns within me, but no one stops to warm themselves at it, and passers-by only see a wisp of smoke","If you hear a voice within you say you cannot paint, then by all means paint and that voice will be silenced.","I put my heart and soul into my work, and I have lost my mind in the process.","What am I in the eyes of most people \u2014 a nonentity, an eccentric, or an unpleasant person \u2014 somebody who has no position in society and will never have; in short, the lowest of the low. All right, then \u2014 even if that were absolutely true, then I should one day like to show by my work what such an eccentric, such a nobody, has in his heart. That is my ambition, based less on resentment than on love in spite of everything, based more on a feeling of serenity than on passion. Though I am often in the depths of misery, there is still calmness, pure harmony and music inside me. I see paintings or drawings in the poorest cottages, in the dirtiest corners. And my mind is driven towards these things with an irresistible momentum.","If you truly love nature, you will find beauty everywhere.","Great things are not done by impulse, but by a series of small things brought together.","I want to touch people with my art. I want them to say \'he feels deeply, he feels tenderly\'.","I am always doing what I cannot do yet, in order to learn how to do it.","I always think that the best way to know God is to love many things.","La tristesse durera toujours.[The sadness will last forever.]","There may be a great fire in our soul, yet no one ever comes to warm himself at it, and the passers-by see only a wisp of

everything, I shall rise again; I will take up my pencil, which I have forsaken in my great discouragement, and I will go on with my drawing.","Those who dream by day are cognizant of many things which escape those who dream only by night.","I\'m such a nobody.","When I have a terrible need of - shall I say the word - religion, then I go out and paint the stars.","Whoever loves much, performs much, and can accomplish much, and what is done in love is done well.","For my part I know nothing with any certainty, but the sight of the stars makes me want to dream.","Looking at the stars always makes me dream, as simply as I dream over the black dots representing towns and villages on a map.Why, I ask myself, shouldn\u2019t the shining dots of the sky be as accessible as the black dots on the map of France?Just as we take a train to get to Tarascon or Rouen, we take death to reach a star. We cannot get to a star while we are alive any more than we can take the train when we are dead. So to me it seems possible that cholera, tuberculosis and cancer are the celestial means of locomotion. Just as steamboats, buses and railways are the terrestrial means.To die quietly of old age would be to go there on foot.","Many people seem to think it foolish, even superstitious, to believe that the world could still change for the better. And it is true that in winter it is sometimes so bitingly cold that one is tempted to say, \u2018What do I care if there is a summer; its warmth is no help to me now.\u2019 Yes, evil often seems to surpass good. But then, in spite of us, and without our permission, there comes at last an end to the bitter frosts. One morning the wind turns, and there is a thaw. And so I must still have hope.","The best way to know life is to love many things","Those who love much, do much and accomplish much, and whatever is done with love is done well.... Love is the best and noblest thing in the human heart, especially when it is tested by life as gold is tested by fire. Happy is he who has loved much, and although he may have wavered and doubted, he has kept that divine spark alive and returned to what was in the beginning and ever shall be. If only one keeps loving faithfully what is truly worth loving and does not squander one\'s love on trivial and insignificant and meaningless things then one will gradually obtain more light and grow stronger.","If I cease searching, then, woe is me, I am lost. That is how I look at it - keep going, keep going come what may.","We are surrounded by poetry on all sides...","I must continue to follow the path I take now. If I do nothing, if I study nothing, if I cease searching, then, woe is me, I am lost. That is how I look at it \u2014 keep going, keep going come what may.But what is your final goal, you may ask. That goal will become clearer, will emerge slowly but surely, much as the rough draught turns into a sketch, and the sketch into a painting through the serious work done on it, through the elaboration of the original vague idea and through the consolidation of the first fleeting and passing thought.","There is a great difference between one idler and another idler. There is someone who is an idler out of laziness and lack of character, owing to the baseness of his nature. If you like, you may take me for one of those. Then there is the other kind of idler, the idler despite himself, who is inwardly consumed by a great longing for action who does nothing because his hands are tied, because he is, so to speak, imprisoned somewhere, because he lacks what he needs to be productive, because disastrous circumstances have brought him forcibly to this end. Such a one does not always know what he can do, but he nevertheless instinctively feels, I am good for something! My existence is not without reason! I know that I could be a quite a different person! How can I be of use, how can I be of service? There is something inside me, but what can it be? He is quite another idler. If you like you may take me for one of those.","There was a sentence in your letter that struck me, \u201cI wish I were far away from everything, I am the cause of all, and bring only sorrow to everybody, I alone have brought all this misery on myself and others. These words struck me because that same feeling, just the same, not more nor less, is also on my conscience.\u201d","The more you love, the more you suffer","So what do you want? Does what happens inside show on the outside? There is such a great fire in one\u2019s soul, and yet nobody ever comes to warm themselves there, and passersby see nothing but a little smoke coming from the top of the chimney, and go on their way.","I take great care of myself by carefully shutting myself away","We feel lonely now and then and long for friends and think we should be quite different and happier if we found a friend of whom we might say: \u201cHe is the one. But you, too, will begin to learn that there is much self-deception behind this longing; if we yielded too much to it, it would lead us from the road.\u201d","And the memories of all we have loved stay and come back to us in the evening of our life. They are not dead but sleep, and it is well to gather a treasure of them.","Bookstores always remind me that there are good things in this world","An artist needn\'t be a clergyman or a church warden, but he must have a warm heart for his fellow men","Quick work doesn\'t mean less serious work, it depends on one\'s self-confidence and experience. In the same way Jules Gu\xe9rard, the lion hunter, says in his book that in the beginning young lions have a lot of trouble killing a horse or an ox, but that the old lions kill with a single blow of the paw or a well-placed bite, and that they are amazingly sure at the job... I must warn you that everyone will think that I work too fast. Don\'t you believe a word of it. Is it not emotion, the sincerity of one\'s feeling for nature, that draws us, and if the emotions are sometimes so strong that one works without knowing one works, when sometimes the strokes come with a continuity and coherence like words in a speech or a letter, then one must remember that it has not always been so, and that in time to come there will again be hard days, empty of inspiration. So one must strike while the iron is hot, and put the forged bars on one side.","I feel that there is nothing more truly artistic than to love people.","It must be good to die in the knowledge that one has done some truthful work...and to know that, as a result, one will live on in the memory of at least a few and leave a good example for those who come after.","How difficult it is to be simple!","be careful not to become narrow-minded, or afraid of reading what is well written, quite the contrary, such writings are a source of comfort in life.","To understand blue you must first understand yellow and orange","I hope to depart in no other way than looking back with love and wistfulness and thinking, oh paintings that I would have made..","I know well that healing comes-if one is brave-from within, through profound resignation to suffering and death, through the surrender of your own will and of your self-love. But that is of no use to me; I love to paint, to see people and things and everything that makes our life-artificial, if you like. Yes, real life would be a different thing, but I do not belong to that category of souls who are ready to live and also at any moment to suffer. I am everything but courageous in sorrow, and everything but patient when I am not feeling well, though I have rather a good deal of patience in keeping to my work.","In would rather die of passion than of boredom.","Many painters are afraid of the blank canvas, but the blank canvas is afraid of the painter who dares and who has broken the spell of \'you can\'t\' once and for all.","If one loves nature one finds beauty everywhere.","Sometimes, dear brother, I know so well what I want. I am quite able to do without God, both in my life and in my painting, but what I cannot do without, unwell as I am, is something greater than myself, which is my life, the power to create.","One of the most beautiful things to do is to paint darkness, which nevertheless has light in it.","I thought I would be understood without words.","I can very well do without God both in my life and in my painting, but I cannot, suffering as I am, do without something which is greater than I, which is my life, the power to create.","I\u2019m always inclined to believe that the best way of knowing [the divine] is to love a great deal. Love that friend, that person, that thing, whatever you like, you\u2019ll be on the right path to knowing more thoroughly, afterwards; that\u2019s what I say to myself. But you must love with a high, serious intimate sympathy, with a will, with intelligence, and you must always seek to know more thoroughly, better, and more.","...a woman does not grow old as long as she loves & is loved.","But what I wanted to say is this: After the period of melancholy is over you will be stronger than before, you will recover your health, & you will find the scenery round you so beautiful that you will want nothing but paint","The earth from afar shines like a star","That is how I look at it; to continue, to continue, that is what is necessary.","My great longing is to learn to make those very incorrectnesses, those deviations, remodellings, changes of reality, so that they may become, yes, untruth if you like - but more true than the literal truth.","Drawing is the root of everything!","Love is something eternal... The aspect may change but not the essence.","..it has always been so much my desire to paint for those who don\u2019t know the artistic side of a painting.","Well, what shall I say; our inward thoughts, do they ever show outwardly? There may be a great fire in our soul, but no one ever comes to warm himself at it, and the passers-by see only a little bit of smoke coming through the chimney, and pass on their way.","money can be repaid, but not kindness such as yours.","Illusions may fade, but the sublime remains.","I\'ll start with the small things","She and I are two unhappy ones who keep together and carry our burdens together, and in this way unhappiness is changed to joy, and the unbearable becomes bearable.","So instead of giving in to despair I chose active melancholy, in so far as I was capable of activity, in other words I chose the kind of melancholy that hopes, that strives and that seeks, in preference to the melancholy that despairs numbly and in distress.","I have tried to express the idea that the caf\xe9 is a place where one can ruin oneself, go mad, or commit a crime.","It is a sad and very melancholy scene, which must strike everyone who knows and feels that we also have to pass one day through the valley of the shadow of death, and \u201cque la fin de la vie humaine, ce sont des larmes ou des cheveux blancs. What lies beyond this is a great mystery that only God knows, but He has revealed absolutely through His word that there is a resurrection of the dead.\u201d","What would be of life if we didn\xb4t have the courage of doing something new?","Well, right now it seems that things are going very badly for me, have been doing so for some considerable time, and may continue to do so well into the future. But it is possible that everything will get better after it has all seemed to go wrong. I am not counting on it, it may never happen, but if there should be a change for the better I should regard that as a gain, I should rejoice, I should say, at last! So there was something after all!","My house here is painted the yellow colour of fresh butter on the outside, with glaringly green shutters; it stands in full sunlight in a square that has a green garden with plane trees, oleanders and acacias. It is completely whitewashed inside, with a floor made of red bricks. And over it there is the intensely blue sky. In this house I can love and breathe, meditate and paint.","Dear brother,I feel what Pa and Ma instinctively think about me (I don\u2019t say reasonably).There\u2019s a similar reluctance about taking me into the house as there would be about having a large, shaggy dog in the house. He\u2019ll come into the room with wet paws \u2014 and then, he\u2019s so shaggy. He\u2019ll get in everyone\u2019s way. And he barks so loudly.In short \u2014 it\u2019s a dirty animal.Very well \u2014 but the animal has a human history and, although it\u2019s a dog, a human soul, and one with finer feelings at that, able to feel what people think about him, which an ordinary dog can\u2019t do.And I, admitting that I am a sort of dog, accept them as they are.Vincent van Gogh to his brother Theo, Nuenen, 15 December 1883","There is safety in the very heart of danger.","There are two ways of reasoning about painting: how to do it and how not to do it; how to d it with great deal of drawing and not much colour, how not to do it with a great deal of colour and not much drawing.","I thought I would be understood without words","The simple minded know many things that the wise ignore","I want to paint humanity, humanity and again humanity.","What I am in the eyes of most people - a nonentity, an eccentric, or an unpleasant person - somebody who has no position in society and will never have; in short, the lowest of the low. All right, then - even if that were absolutely true, then I should like to show by my work what such an eccentric, such a nobody, has in his heart.","If one wants to be active, one mustn\u2019t be afraid to do something wrong sometimes, not afraid to lapse into some mistakes. To be good \u2014 many people think that they\u2019ll achieve it by doing no harm \u2014 and that\u2019s a lie\u2026 That leads to stagnation, to mediocrity. Just slap something on it when you see a blank canvas staring at you with a sort of imbecility.","The more I think it over, the more I feel that there is nothing more truly artistic than to love people.","Future generations will probably be able to enlighten us on this very interesting subject, and then science itself\u2014with all due respect\u2014may reach conclusions that are more or less in keeping with Christ\'s sayings about the other half of our life.","The way to know life is to love many things.","How much sadness there is in life. Still, it won\'t do to become depressed, one should turn to other things, and the right thing is work, but there are times when one can only find peace of mind in the realization: I, too, shall not be spared by unhappiness.","One must seize the reality of one\u2019s fate and that\u2019s that.","Our goals can only be reached through a vehicle of a plan, in which we must fervently believe, and upon which we must vigorously act. There is no other route to success. - Vincent van Gogh\u201d","I am so angry with myself because I cannot do what I should like to do, and at such a moment one feels as if one were lying bound hand and foot at the bottom of a deep dark well, utterly helpless.","It is only right and proper to be moved by the Bible, but present-day reality has so strong a hold over us that even when we try to imagine the past the minor events in our lives immediately wrench us out of our musings, and our own adventures throw us back irrevocably upon our personal feelings\u2014joy, boredom, suffering, anger, or a smile.","Where friendship blooms, life is reborn.","There are often beams in our eye that we know not of. Let us therefore ask that our eye may become single, for then we ourselves shall become wholly single.","It\'s not the language of painters but the language of nature which one should listen to, for reality is more important than the feeling for pictures.","I am seeking, I am striving, I am in it with all my heart .","For me, life may well continue in solitude. I have never perceived those to whom I have been most attached other than as through a glass, darkly.","I always feel that I am a traveler, going somewhere and to some destination.If I tell myself that the somewhere and the destination do not exist, that seems to me very likely and reasonable enough.The brothel keeper, when he kicks anyone out, has similar logic, argues it well, and is always right, I know. So at the end of the course I shall find my mistake. Be it so. I shall find then that not only the Arts, but everything else as well, were only dreams, that one\'s self was nothing at all.","When I see how several painters I know here are struggling with their watercolours and paintings so that they can\'t see a solution anymore, I sometimes think: Friend, the fault is in your drawing. I don\'t regret for a moment that I did not go in for watercolour and oil painting straight away. I am sure I will catch up if only I struggle on, so that my hand does not waver in drawing and perspective.","If one feels the need of something grand, something infinite, something that makesone feel aware of God, one need not go far to find it.","If only we try to live righteously, we shall fare well, even though we are bound to encounter genuine sadness and real disappointments and shall probably commit real mistakes and do things that are wrong, but it is certainly better to be ardent in spirit, even though one makes more mistakes, than narrow-minded and overly-cautious.","To express the love of two lovers by the marriage of two complementary colours, their blending and their contrast, the mysterious vibrations of related tones. To express the thought of a brow by the radiance of a light tone against a dark background. To express hope by some star. Someone\'s passion by the radiance of the setting sun. That\'s certainly no realistic trompe l\'oeil, but something that really exists, isn\'t it?","In order to work and to become an artist one needs love. At least, one who wants sentiment in his work must in the first place feel it himself, and live with his heart.","You can live to be old or young, but you\'ll always have moments when you lose your head.","So don\u2019t study and swot too much, for that makes one sterile. Enjoy yourself too much rather than too little, and don\u2019t take art or love too seriously- there is very little one can do about it","Do you know what frees one from this captivity? It is every deep serious affection. Being friends, being brothers, love, these open the prison by supreme power, by some magic force. Where sympathy is renewed, life is restored.","Do go on doing a lot of walking and keep up your love of nature, for that is the right way to understand art better and better. Painters understand nature and love her and teach us to see. And there are painters who never do anything that is no good...","You can feel the stars and the infinity of the sky. Since life, in spite of everything, is like a fairytale.","Against all expectations, the symptoms of Van Gogh\u2019s mental illness are conspicuous by their almost complete absence from his letters. Much as he chose not to paint before he had fully recovered from one of his attacks, so he refrained from writing at times of crisis. Throughout his life, admittedly, his letters bear witness to a man possessed, frequently agitated, enraged, dejected, obsessed, but never deranged, or emotionally or intellectually unstable.","I would sooner paint people\'s eyes than cathedrals, for there is something in the eyes that is lacking in a cathedral - however solemn and impressive it may be. To my mind a man\'s soul, be it that of a poor beggar or of a streetwalker, is more interesting.","What am I in the eyes of most people? A good-for-nothing, an eccentric and disagreeable man, somebody who has no position in society and never will have. Very well, even if that were true, I should want to show by my work what there is in the heart of such an eccentric man, of such a nobody.","At present this horror of life is already less pronounced, and the melancholy less acute. But I still have no will, and hardly any desires, or none at all that are to do with ordinary life.","For love is something positive, so strong, so real that it is impossible for one who loves to take back that feeling...So I remain calm and confident through all this, and that influences my work, which attracts me more than ever, just because I feel I shall succeed. Not that I shall become anything extraordinary, but \u201cordinary, and then I mean by ordinary, that my work will be sound and reasonable, and will have a right to exist, and will serve to some end. I think that nothing awakens us to the reality of life so much as a true love\u2026\u201d","It must be good to die in the knowledge that one has done some truthful work and to know that, as a result, one will live in the memory of at least a few and leave a good example for those who come after. A work that is good may not last forever, but the thought expressed by it will, and the work itself will surely survive for a very long time, and those who come later can do no better than follow in the footsteps of such predecessors and copy their example.","Lord, keep my thoughts green! That is something one should say over and over again.","It quite often makes me feel sad that painting\u2019s like a bad mistress one might have, who\u2019s always spending, spending and it\u2019s never enough.. [Letter 630, Arles, 23 June 1888]","Be of good heart.","How I wish we could spend a couple of Christmas days together, for instance \u2014 I would also dearly like to have you in my studio once more.I, too, have been toiling quite hard recently, precisely because I was full of the Christmas feeling, and feeling isn\u2019t enough, one must bring it into one\u2019s work.So I\u2019m now occupied with two large heads of an orphan man, with his white beard and old-fashioned, old top hat.This chap has the sort of old, lively face that one would wish for beside a cosy Christmas fire.","And sometimes there is relief, sometimes there is new inner energy, and one stands up after it; till at last, someday, one perhaps doesn\'t stand up any more, que soit, but that is nothing extraordinary, and I repeat, in my opinion, such is the common.","Dans chaque vie o\xf9 de la pluie doit tomber, quelques jours seront sombres et lugubres \u2013 c\'est vrai, il ne peut en aller autrement, et pourtant je me demande si le nombre de jours sombres et lugubres peut parfois devenir trop grand ?

At the same time, I feel a great calm and brightness and cheerfulness at the thought of her, and the straight path that is lying before me.","The world concerns me only in so far as I owe it a certain debt and duty, so to speak, because I have walked this earth for 30 years, and out of gratitude would like to leave some memento in the form of drawings and paintings\u2014not made to please this school or that, but to express a genuine human feeling.","D\xfcnyan\u0131n beni ilgilendiren tek bir yan\u0131 var: Otuz y\u0131l \xfcst\xfcnde ya\u015fad\u0131\u011f\u0131m bu topra\u011fa kar\u015f\u0131 duydu\u011fum belirli bir bor\xe7 ve y\xfcklendi\u011fime inand\u0131\u011f\u0131m bir g\xf6rev; duydu\u011fum bu \u015f\xfckran borcuna kar\u015f\u0131l\u0131k desen ya da resim olarak birka\xe7 anda\xe7 b\u0131rakmak istiyorum geride -birtak\u0131m sanat ak\u0131mlar\u0131n\u0131n ho\u015funa girmek i\xe7in de\u011fil, ger\xe7ek, i\xe7ten, insanc\u0131l duygular\u0131 dile getirmek i\xe7in. \u0130\u015fte, ya\u015famdaki amac\u0131m bu.","I knew well enough that one could fracture one\u2019s legs and arms and recover afterward, but I did not know that you could fracture the brain in your head and recover from that too.","I keep hoping that I\u2019ll come up with something.

On the positive awareness that art is something great and higher than our own skill or knowledge or learning. That art is something which though produced by human hands, is not wrought by hands alone, but wells up from a deeper source, from man\u2019s soul, while much of the proficiency and technical expertise associated with art reminds me of what would be called self-righteousness in religion.","Ah, scumpul meu frate, uneori \xeemi dau at\xe2t de bine seama de ceea ce vreau!

It is difficult to define - my physical passions were very weak then, perhaps because of a few years of great poverty and hard work. But my intellectual passions were strong, meaning that without asking anything in return, without wanting any pity, I wanted only to give, but not to receive. Foolish, wrong, exaggerated, proud, rash - for in love one must not only give, but also take; and, reversing it, one must not only take but also give.","But you must love with a high, serious intimate sympathy, with a will, with intelligence, and you must always seek to know more thoroughly, better, and more.","To me, that book has been both a revelation and a gospel.","Van Gogh: \u201cI know nothingwith any certainty, but the sight of stars makes medream.","No particular reason for anything. ~I\'m free~ And that is the main thing.","If the emotions are sometimes so strong that one works without knowing one works, when sometimes the strokes come with a continuity and a coherence like words in a speech or a letter, then one must remember that it has not always been so, and that in time to come there will again be hard days, empty of inspiration.So one must strike while the iron is hot, and put the forged bars on one side.","Je t\'ai envoy\xe9 aujourd\'hui mon portrait \xe0 moi; il faut le regarder pendant quelque temps, tu verras, j\'esp\xe8re que ma physionomie s\'est bien calm\xe9e, quoique le regard soit vague davantage qu\'auparavant, \xe0 ce qui me parait.","Don\'t regret that your life is too easy, mine is rather easy too; I think that life is pretty long and that the time will arrive soon enough in which \\"another shall gird thee and carry thee where thou wouldst not.","One morning the wind turns, and there is a thaw. And so I must still have hope.","Housed in the Van Gogh Museum in Amsterdam, the following plate was completed in 1886, portraying the unusual subject of a skeleton smoking a cigarette. The work has roused many interpretations, including a depiction of mortality and a prophetic cry of the dangers of tobacco. In the next two years, van Gogh painted two other paintings with skulls, illustrating his fascination with the macabre subject.","Do you know what I have been involuntarily thinking, that in the first period of an artist\u2019s life, one unconsciously makes it very hard for oneself \u2013 by a feeling of not being able to master the work \u2013 by an uncertainty as to whether one will ever master it \u2013 by a great ambition to make progress, but a lack of self-confidence \u2013 one cannot banish a certain feeling of agitation, and one hurries oneself though one doesn\u2019t like to be hurried . . . This cannot be helped, and it is a time which one must go through, and which in my opinion cannot and should not be otherwise.","I have had no \u201cguidance or teaching from others to speak of, but taught myself; no wonder my technique, considered superficially, differs from that of others.

A white road crosses the canvas, on the road a little carriage and some white houses with bright red roofs alongside a road. Fine drizzle streaks the whole with blue or grey lines.","\u0623\u0641\u0636\u0644 \u0623\u0646 \u0623\u0645\u0648\u062a \u062d\u0628\u0627\u064b... \u0639\u0644\u0649 \u0623\u0646 \u0623\u0645\u0648\u062a \u0645\u0644\u0644\u0627\u064b...","Oh, I am no friend of present-day Christianity, though its founder was sublime- I have seen through present-day Christianity only too well. That icy coldness mesmerized even me, in my youth- but I have taken my revenge since then. How?

To me she is the opposite.ov","If I should later come to see that I did wrong, well, then I shall of course be sorry, but as it is I have been unable to see how else I could possibly have acted.

All right, then \u2014 even if that were absolutely true, then I should one day like to show by my work what such an eccentric, such a nobody, has in his heart. That is my ambition, based less on resentment than on love in spite of everything, based more on a feeling of serenity than on passion. Though I am often in the depths of misery, there is still calmness, pure harmony and music inside me.","And although it was in a hospital that she lay and I sat next to her\u2014it is always that eternal poetry of Christmas night with the infant in the stable, as the old Dutch painters conceived it and MIllet and Breton\u2014a light in the darkness, the brightness in the middle of a dark night. And so I hung a large etching after Rembrandt over it, the two women by the cradle, one of them reading from the Bible by candlelight, while the great shadows cast a deep chiaroscuro over the whole room.","Biliyorsun, \u015fakay\u0131k \xe7i\xe7e\u011fi Jeannine\'ndir, hatmi \xe7i\xe7e\u011fi Quost\'a aittir, ay\xe7i\xe7e\u011fi de galiba biraz benim...","Yesterday, I went to see Gladwell, who is home for a few days. A terrible blow has struck them, his young sister, so full of life, with dark eyes and hair, had fallen from a horse at Blackheath; they found her unconscious and she died five hours later, without regaining consciousness. She was seventeen years old. As soon as I heard the news, I went to see them, knowing that Gladwell was home. I left at eleven o\u2019clock; and had a long walk to Lewisham. I crossed London from one end to the other and didn\u2019t arrive at my destination until almost five o\u2019clock. They had all just come back from the funeral; the whole household was in mourning. I was happy to have come, but confused, truly upset by the spectacle of a pain so great and so venerable. \u201cBlessed are they that mourn, blessed are they that sorrow, but always rejoice, blessed are the pure in heart for they shall see God. Blessed are those that find love on their road, who are bound together by God, for to them all things will work together for their good. I chatted for a long time, until evening, with Harry, about everything, the kingdom of God, the Bible; we chatted further, we walked up and down the station platform. Never will we forget the moments before we said goodbye.\u201d","But what is it to me whether my chance is slight or great? I mean, must I consider this when I love?

These words struck me because that same feeling, just the same, not more nor less, is also on my conscience. When I think of the past, - when I think of the future of almost invincible difficulties, of much and difficult work, which I do not like, which I, or rather my evil self, would like to shirk; when I think the eyes of so many are fixed on me, - who will know where the fault is, if I do not succeed, who will not make me trivial reproaches, but as they are well tried and trained in everything that is right and virtuous and fine gold, they will say, as it were by the expression of their faces: we have helped you and have been a light unto you, - we have done for you what we could, have you tried honestly? what is now our reward and the fruit of our labour? See! when I think of all this, and of so many other things like it, too numerous to name them all, of all the difficulties and cares that do not grow less when we advance in life, of sorrow, of disappointment, of the fear of failure, of disgrace, - then I also have the longing - I wish I were far away from everything\u201d","And yet I go on; if we are tired isn\u2019t it then because we have already walked a long way, and if it is true that man has his battle to fight on earth, is not then the feeling of weariness and the burning of the head a sign that we have been struggling?

His disappointments have often made him fell bitter and have turned him into an unusual person.","During the past few years he has been working at home with us; after my father\u2019s death, Anna thought it would be more peaceful for Mother if he stopped living at home, and saw to it that he left us.

There are so many people, especially among our comrades, who imagine that words are nothing - on the contrary, isn\u2019t it true that saying a thing well is as interesting and as difficult as painting it? There is the art of lanes and colours, but the art of words is there nonetheless, and will remain.","pareceu-me que voc\xea, assim como eu, estava sofrendo por ver sua juventude passar em brancas nuvens; mas se ela nasce e ressurge no que fazemos, nada est\xe1 perdido e a capacidade de trabalhar \xe9 uma nova juventude.","Cada vez mais eu acho que n\xe3o se deve julgar o bom Deus a partir deste mundo daqui, pois este \xe9 um estudo seu que n\xe3o deu certo.","Cuando siento una necesidad de religi\xf3n, salgo de noche y pinto las estrellas.","I had left romantic illusions behind me.

It must be good to die in the knowledge that one has done some truthful work and to know that, as a result, one will live on in the memory of at least a few and leave a good example for those who come after. A work that is good may not last forever, but the thought expressed by it will, and the work itself will surely survive for a very long time, and those who come later can do no more than follow in the footsteps of such predecessors and copy their example.","Now and then when I am writing, I automatically do a small drawing, such as I sent you lately.

Of course with me there is no question of doing anything from the Bible - and I have written to Bernard and Gauguin too that I considered that our duty is thinking, not dreaming, so that when looking at their work I was astonished at their letting themselves go like that. For Bernard has sent me photos of his canvases. The trouble with them is that they are a sort of dream or nightmare - that they are erudite enough - you can see that it is someone who is gone on the primitives - but frankly the English Pre-Raphaelites did it much better, and then again Puvis and Delacroix, much more healthily than the Pre-Raphaelite","I don\u2019t need to rush, for there is no point in that, but I must carry on working in complete calm and serenity, as regularly and with as much concentration as possible, as much to the point as possible. The world concerns me only in so far as I owe it certain debt and duty, so to speak, because I have walked this earth for 30 years, and out of gratitude would like to leave some memento in the form of drawings and paintings - not made to please this school or that, but to express a genuine human feeling.","There was enough reason for it too, as the whole of France was shaken. Certainly in our eyes the election and its results and its representatives are only symbols. But what it proves once more is that worldly ambition and fame pass away, but the human heart beats the same to this day, in as perfect sympathy with the past of our buried forefathers as with the generation to come.","Todas as suas bondades para comigo, hoje eu as achei maiores do que nunca, n\xe3o consigo dizer-lhe como eu o sinto, mas eu lhe asseguro que essa bondade foi de um bom quilate, e se voc\xea n\xe3o v\xea seus resultados, meu caro irm\xe3o, n\xe3o se atormente por isto, sua bondade permanecer\xe1.","Moreover, the material problems of the painter\u2019s life make it desirable that painters should collaborate and unite (much as they did in the days of the Guilds of St. Luke). If only they would ensure their material well-being, and love one another like friends instead of making one another\u2019s life hell, painters would be happier, and in any case less ridiculous, less foolish and less culpable.","Completed in Arles late in 1888 and now housed in the National Gallery, London, this painting depicts the artist\u2019s humble chair and pipe. The work was completed shortly after Gauguin\u2019s departure from the Yellow House. The two artists had quarrelled bitterly, causing Gauguin to write to Theo, \u201cThe incompatibility of both our characters means that Vincent and I cannot live together peacefully. It is imperative that I leave. Vincent was devastated, seeing his dreams of establishing an artists\u2019 commune with Gauguin shatter and disappear. In response, he painted his and Gauguin\u2019s empty chairs, symbolising the loneliness and isolation that he felt. Van Gogh\u2019s wooden chair is more modest, with the pipe and tobacco adding to its humble image; whilst Gauguin\u2019s more elaborate chair, holding a book and candle, suggests learning and ambition. Van Gogh\u2019s choice of colours for his chair include yellow and violet, hinting at daylight and a metaphorical idea of hope for the future. In contrast, Gauguin\u2019s chair is depicted in darker colours of red and green, which along with the candle, enforce the idea of night-time. Together, the pictures represent day and night, with the painting of Gauguin\u2019s chair suggesting that the absent friend had brought light and happiness to van Gogh\u2019s evenings.\u201d","mas sei muito bem como fiquei impressionado pela harmonia de verde, vermelho, preto, amarelo, azul, castanho, cinza.","Understand that the more clear-cut we are about this, the sooner they will come to you to see them. You yourself do not sell my work, so you are not doing business outside the firm of Boussod V. & Co. by showing it. So you will be acting quite correctly, which is always decent. However, should someone or other want to buy, very good, then they have only to apply directly to me. But be sure of this, if we can stand the siege, my time will come.","pois me restam graves remorsos, dif\xedceis de definir.

Long, long ago I read in L\u2019Ami Fritz by Erckmann-Chatrian a saying of the old rabbi\u2019s, which I have always remembered: \u201cNous ne sommes pas dans la vie pour etre heureux, mais nous devons tacher de meriter le bonheur. [We are not in life to be happy, but we must try to deserve happiness.] Taken separately, there is something pedantic in this thought - at least, one might take it as such - but in the context in which the words occurred, that is, from the mouth of that sympathetic figure of the old rabbi, David Sechel, they touched me deeply, and I often think of them.\u201d","Yes, boy, one perseveres and works on without minding the rest, if one tries honestly and freely to fathom nature, and does not lose hold of what one has in mind whatever people may say, then one feels calm and steady and faces the future quietly. Yes, one may make mistakes, one may perhaps exaggerate here or there, but the thing one makes will be original. You have read in Rappard\u2019s letter the words: \u201cI used to make things now in this, then in that style, without sufficient personality: but these last drawings have at least a character of their own, and I feel that I have found my way. I feel almost the same thing now.\u201d","Goodbye, write again between times if you can. As to the money, do what you can, but remember that we must try our utmost to succeed. And I won\u2019t let that idea of painting portraits go, for it is a good thing to fight for, to show people that there is more in them than the photographer can possibly get out of them with his machine.","But always those same conventional eyes, noses, mouths - waxlike and smooth and cold. It cannot but always remain lifeless. And the painted portraits have a life of their own, coming straight from the painter\u2019s soul, which the machine cannot reach. The more one looks at photographs, the more one feels this, I think.","You know that Gauguin is invited to exhibit at the \u201cVingtistes. He is already imagining settling in Brussels, and that certainly would be a means towards his being able to see his Danish wife again. Since in the meantime he is very successful with the Arl\xe9siennes, I should not consider this entirely insignificant. He is married but he doesn\u2019t look it very much. In short, I fear that there is an absolute incompatibility of character between his wife and him, but he naturally cares more for his children, who are very pretty according to the portraits.\u201d","I must tell you that even while working I think continually about the plan of setting up a studio in which you and I will be permanent residents, but which both of us want to turn into a shelter and refuge for friends, against the times when they find that the struggle is getting too much for them.","Now, I\'m going through a similar period of struggle and despondency, of patience and impatience, of hope and desolation.

I am sorry to tell you that I think he is lost. Not only is his mind affected, but also he is very weak and despondent. He recognized me but did not show any pleasure at seeing me and didn\u2019t ask about any member of my family nor anyone else that he knows. When I left him I told him that I would come back to see him; he replied that we would meet again in heaven, and from his manner I understand that he was saying a prayer. From what the porter told me, I think that they are taking the necessary steps to have him placed in a mental hospital.","Veja voc\xea, o que reconforta \xe9 n\xe3o ter que correr sempre s\xf3 com nossos pensamentos e nossas ideias, mas colaborar e trabalhar com um grupo.

A row of pollard willows sometimes resembles a procession of almshouse men. Young corn has something inexpressibly pure and tender about it, which awakens the same emotion as the expression of a sleeping baby, for instance. The trodden grass at the roadside looks tired and dusty like the people of the slums. A few days ago, when it had been snowing, I saw a group of Savoy cabbages standing frozen and benumbed, and it reminded me of a group of women in their thin petticoats and old shawls which I had seen standing in a little hot water-and-coal shop early in the morning.","Today, Friday, I went there but could not see him. The intern and the attendant told me that after my wife left, he had had a terrible attack; he had a very bad night, and they had to put him in an isolated room.

Do please give that some thought.\u201d","That affair with the priest has not given me any more trouble. But of course there will always be God-fearing natives in the village who will persist in suspecting me, for one thing is sure, namely that the priest would only too gladly throw the whole blame of that affair on me. However, as I am quite innocent, the gossip from that quarter leaves me perfectly indifferent; as long as they don\u2019t bother me in my painting. I don\u2019t take any notice of it whatever. With the peasants to whom the accident happened, where I often used to paint, I have remained on good terms, and I am as welcome in their home as I used to be. I am now busy painting still lifes of my birds\u2019 nests, four of which are finished; I think some people who are good observers of nature might like them because of the colours of the moss, the dry leaves and the grasses.","I cannot say that your letter of today was the least bit useful or necessary to me. Only I assure you that your saying your belief in me was shaken and all that leaves me pretty indifferent - you are no exception in this as far as certain others are concerned. I let people say of me and think of me whatever they like and treat me just as they like - that is their business; I am not obligated to listen to their everlasting drivel. My parents, my teachers, Messrs. Goupil & Co., and furthermore all kinds of friends and acquaintances have said so many unpleasant things to me for my own good and with the best intentions that in the end the burden has become a little too heavy for me; and since I let people talk without paying any attention to it, I have not fallen off, my friend - this much I think I know for sure.","But more and more I begin to believe that there is something compared to which all opinions, mine included, become as nothing.

Opinions can as little change certain standard truths as weathercocks can change the direction of the wind. The weathercocks do not make the wind east or north, nor can opinions make the truth true.","As far as your work goes - there you are! - I think your present work is excellent - but here comes a thought exactly as it is in my mind, without concealing anything - I have known you for a pretty long time. There was a time - immediately before and immediately after your illness - when you were much less dry as a human being than you have been at other times - fuller, milder, broader, more generous - more straightforward and ingenuous.

Uncle saw it and ordered out a boat from the Makassar which was tied at the dock. They dragged the little boy out. Two ship\u2019s doctors whom Uncle sent for and I accompanied the men who carried the little boy to the drugstore; every effort was made to revive the child, but in vain. Meanwhile, the father, who is stoker at the yard, recognized the little body, and they carried it home in a blanket. They continued searching for an hour and a half, thinking the little girl had also been drowned, but fortunately that seems not to have been the case. That evening when I went to see those people once more, it was already dark in the house; the little body was lying so still on a bed in the little parlour - he was such a pretty little boy. The sorrow was great; he had been the light of the house, as it were, and the light had now been extinguished. Though rough people express their sorrow crudely and without dignity, like this mother, one still feels deeply in a house of mourning, and the spell remained with me the whole evening, while I took a long walk.","Mind, as to Gauguin we must not give up the idea of coming to his aid if the suggestion is acceptable as it stands, but we do not need him.

I wish you were or would become a painter. I say this straight out, more emphatically than before, because I really believe that the great art-dealing business is in many respects a speculation like the bulb trade was. And the situations in it, dependent on chance and freaks of fortune.\u201d","How much good walking out to the desolate seashore and gazing out at the grey-green sea with the long white crests on its waves can do for a man who is downcast and dejected! But if one should have a need for something great, something infinite, something one can perceive God in, there is no need to go far in quest; it seems to me that I have seen something deeper, more infinite, more eternal than the ocean in the expression in a small child\u2019s eyes when it awakens early in the morning and yells or laughs on finding the dear sun shining upon it\u2019s cradle. If ever a \u201crayon d\u2019en haut, [a beam shines down from above] that may be where it is to be found.\u201d","Contudo procuro sistematicamente evitar as brigas, e prossigo quietinho no meu caminho.","You have been lucky to meet Guy de Maupassant. I have just read his first book, Des Vers, poems dedicated to his master Flaubert; there is one, \u201cAu bord de l\u2019eau, which is already himself.

I thought that he was on the rocks, and there I was with money, and this boy who does better work than I do with none; so I said, He ought to have half of mine, and let him, if he likes. But if Gauguin isn\u2019t on the rocks, then I am in no great hurry. And I withdraw my proposal categorically, and the only question left for me is simply this: if I looked for a comrade to work with, would it be a good thing, would it be to my brother\u2019s advantage and mine, and would the other fellow lose by it, or would he gain? These are the questions that my mind is running on, but they\u2019d have to come up against reality to become facts.","But if Gauguin and his Jewish bankers came tomorrow and asked me for no more than 10 pictures for a society of dealers, and not a society of artists, on my word I do not know if I\u2019d have confidence in it, though I would willingly give 50 to a society of artists.","No entanto, por menos que diga, eu os irrito e eles me irritam","It is possible that these great geniuses are only madmen, and that one must be mad oneself to have boundless faith in them and a boundless admiration for them.

Tersteeg, and along with him a lot of fellows who knew me when I was with Goupil & Co., went so far in their disapproval of all my doings that these last years, instead of wasting any more time on attempts to convince them, I, who have no time to waste, have simply given them the cold shoulder in my turn - and let them say, think, do whatever they like without minding it the least little bit.","Per il momento tutte le mie faccende a quanto pare vanno male, e ci\xf2 \xe8 gi\xe0 avvenuto per un periodo di tempo non trascurabile; questo potr\xe0 durare ancora per un periodo di durata pi\xf9 o meno lunga, ma pu\xf2 accadere che, quando tutto sembra andare di traverso, vada poi bene in un secondo tempo.

However, Van der Loo [the van Gogh\u2019s doctor in Brabant] said, when I consulted him shortly before I came here, that I am reasonably strong apr\xe8s tout. That I needn\u2019t despair of reaching the requisite age to produce a complete body of work. I told him that I knew several painters who, for all their nervousness, etc., had reached the age of 60, or even 70, fortunately for themselves, and that I should like to do the same.","It does one good to read things like that, more than most of the stuff the decadents write, with their passion for saying the most obvious things in the most wildly contorted phrases.","And that I relinquished my share in the inheritance; inasmuch as during the last years I had lived in great discord with my father, I felt I did not have a right to anything that was his, and for that matter I did not covet it.

It is true the Bible is eternal and everlasting, but Michelet gives such very practical and clear hints, so directly applicable to this hurried and feverish modern life in which you and I find ourselves, that he helps us to progress rapidly; we cannot do without him. The Bible consists of different parts and there is growth from one to the next; for instance, there is a difference between Moses and Noah on the one hand, and Jesus and Paul on the other. Now take Michelet and Beecher Stowe: they don\u2019t tell you the Gospel is no longer of any value but they show how it may be applied in our time, in this our life, by you and me, for instance. Michelet even expresses completely and aloud things which the Gospel whispers only the germ of.","B\xfcy\xfck sanat\xe7\u0131lar\u0131n, ger\xe7ek ustalar\u0131n, ba\u015fyap\u0131tlar\u0131nda bize s\xf6ylemek istediklerinin ger\xe7ek anlam\u0131n\u0131 kavramaya \xe7al\u0131\u015fmak da insan\u0131 Tanr\u0131\'ya g\xf6t\xfcr\xfcr.

We are full-grown men now and are standing like soldiers in the rank and file of our generation. We do not belong to the same one as Father and Mother and Uncle Stricker; we must be more faithful to the modern than to the old one - to look back toward the old one is fatal. If the older people do not understand us, it must not upset us, and we must go our own way against their will; later on they will say of their own accord, Yes, you were right after all.","Oh might I be shown the way to devote my life more completely to the service of God and the Gospel. I keep praying for it and I think I shall be heard, I say it in all humility. Humanly speaking, one would say it cannot happen, but when I think seriously about it and penetrate under the surface of what is impossible to man, then my soul is in communion with God, for it is possible to Him, who speaks and it is done; who commands and it stands fast. Oh! Theo, Theo boy, if I might only succeed in this, if that heavy depression because everything I undertook failed, that torrent of reproaches which I have heard and felt, if it might be taken from me, and if there might be given to me both the opportunity and the strength needed to come to full development and to persevere in that course for which my father and I would thank the Lord so fervently.","You have changed since then, you are no longer the same. Well, that is not entirely true. What has changed is that my life then was less difficult and my future seemingly less gloomy, but as far as my inner self, my way of looking at things and of thinking is concerned, that has not changed. But if there has indeed been a change, then it is that I think, believe and love more seriously now what I thought, believed and loved even then.\u201d","beings with grains of corn, now - in every human being who is healthy and natural there is a germinating force, just as there is in a grain of corn. And so natural life is germination. What the germinating force is to the grain, love is to us.

After all, one is not in the world for one\u2019s own comfort, and one does not need to be better off than one\u2019s neighbour.","So now, when anyone says that such and such is done too quickly, you can reply that they have looked at it too quickly.","As to this region here, I know the country and the people too well and love them too much to be positively leaving them for good.

You cannot always tell what keeps you confined, what immures you, what seems to bury you, and yet you can feel those elusive bars, railings, walls. Is all this illusion, imagination? I don\'t think so. And then one asks: My God! will it be for long, will it be for ever, will it be for eternity?Do you know what makes the prison disappear? Every deep, genuine affection. Being friends, being brothers, loving, that is what opens the prison, with supreme power, by some magic force. Without these one stays dead. But whenever affection is revived, there life revives.","O que eu quero dizer e o que eu aspiro \xe9 tremendamente dif\xedcil, e no entanto n\xe3o acredito estar aspirando alto demais.","Whatever you wish for yourself, too, hold firm to the thought of Christ and treasure His word - just as you do. It is good to believe that there is a God who knows what we want better than we do ourselves, and Who helps us whenever we are in need of it. And it is also good to believe that now, just as in olden days, an angel is not far from those who are sad - strengthened unto God - not only to those who are nearly angels themselves, but particularly to those who want the help of a higher power to be preserved from the evil, from the badness which we know is in the world and not far away from us - not far from those who are broken-hearted and dejected in spirit.","Is the Bible enough for us? These days I think Jesus himself would say again to those who sit down in melancholy, \u201cIt is not here, it is risen. Why seek ye the living among the dead?","My own adventures are confined chiefly to making swift progress toward growing into a little old man - you know, with wrinkles, a tough beard and a number of false teeth, and so on. But what does all that matter? I have a dirty and difficult trade - painting, and if I were not as I am, I should not paint; but being as I am, I often work with pleasure and can visualize the vague possibility of one day doing paintings with some youth and freshness in them, even though my own youth is one of the things I have lost.","I would rather die of passion than of boredom.","When I came here I hoped it would be possible to make some connection with art lovers here, but up to the present I haven\u2019t made the least progress in people\u2019s affection. And Marseilles? I don\u2019t know, but that may very well be nothing but an illusion. In any case I have quite given up gambling much on it. Often whole days pass without my speaking to anyone, except to ask for dinner or coffee. And it has been like that from the beginning.","Em suma, quero chegar ao ponto em que digam de minha obra: este homem sente profundamente, e este homem sente delicadamente.","I should very much like to see Millet reproductions in the schools. I think there are children who would become painters if only they saw good things.","Please do not take my making this comparison as an insult, brother, it is better to be a sheep than a wolf, better to be slain than to slay - better to be Abel than Cain. And, and - I hope, or rather I am sure, that I am not a wolf either. Suppose that it\u2019s not just in our imagination, but that you and I are really like sheep among our fellow creatures. All right - granting the existence of rather hungry and false wolves, it would not be impossible that we should be devoured someday. Well, this may not be so very pleasant, but I tell myself: It is, after all, better to be ruined than to do the ruining.","The desire for women that you catch in Paris, isn\u2019t it rather the effect of that very enervation which Gruby is the sworn enemy of than a sign of vigour? So you feel this desire disappearing at the very moment you are yourself again. The root of the evil lies in the constitution itself, in the fatal weakening of families from generation to generation, and besides that, in one\u2019s unwholesome job and the dreary life in Paris. The root of the evil certainly lies there, and there\u2019s no cure for it.","N\xe3o \xe9 tanto a l\xedngua dos pintores, mas a l\xedngua da natureza \xe0 qual \xe9 preciso dar ouvidos.","...be\u015fikteki bir \xe7ocu\u011fun g\xf6zlerinde de onu uzun s\xfcre yeterince seyredersen e\u011fer, sonsuzlu\u011fu g\xf6r\xfcrs\xfcn.

We know very little about this, about its proportions, and it is better to look at a wheat field, even in the form of a picture.","People who do nothing but fall in love are perhaps more serious and saintly than those who sacrifice their love and their hearts to an idea.","When he came here two years ago I had not expected that we would become so much attached to each other, for now that I am alone in the apartment there is a decided emptiness about me. If I can find someone I will take him in, but it is not easy to replace someone like Vincent. It is unbelievable how much he knows and what a sane view he has of the world. If he still has some years to live I am certain that he will make a name for himself. Through him I got to know many painters who regarded him very highly. He is one of the avant-garde for new ideas, that is to say, there is nothing new under the sun and so it would be better to say: for the regeneration of the old ideas which through routine have been diluted and worn out. In addition he has such a big heart that he always tries to do something for others. It\u2019s a pity for those who cannot understand him or refuse to do so.","When God supports us, illness is no misfortune, especially when we get new ideas and new intentions in those days of illness that would not have come to us if what not been ill, and when we achieve clearer faith and stronger trust in God.","Still, I went with Vincent a few times to listen to a Wagner concert before he left, and we both liked it very much. It still seems strange that he has gone, he has lately meant so much to me.","N\xe3o te oculto que teria preferido morrer a causar e a sofrer tantos dissabores.Mas que queres? Sofrer sem se queixar \xe9 a \xfanica li\xe7\xe3o que tratamos de aprender na vida.","But since then I\u2019ve had no chance of getting models, though on the other hand I did have the chance to study the colour question. And if I should find models again for my figures later, then I would hope to be able to show that I am after something other than little green landscapes or flowers.","I believe that if we knew everything we should attain some serenity. Now, having as much of that serenity as possible, even when one knows little or nothing for certain, is perhaps a better remedy for all ills than what is sold in the pharmacy. Much of it comes by itself, one grows and develops of one\u2019s own accord.","Did I tell you that I had sent the drawings to friend Russell? At the moment I am doing practically the same ones again for you, there will be twelve likewise. You will then see better what there is in the painted studies in the way of drawing. I have already told you that I always have to fight against the mistral, which makes it absolutely impossible to be master of your stroke. That accounts for the \u201chaggard look of the studies.\u201d","I am writing to Russell at the same time. I think we know, don\u2019t we, that the English, the Yankees, have this much in common with the Dutch, that their charity\u2026is very Christian. Now, the rest of us not being very good Christians\u2026That\u2019s what I can\u2019t put out of my head writing again like this.","Only a few words to tell you that my health and my work are not progressing so badly. It astonishes me already when I compare my condition today with what it was a month ago. Before that I knew well enough that one could fracture one\u2019s legs and arms and recover afterward, but I did not know that you could fracture the brain in your head and recover from that too. I still have a sort of \u201cwhat is the good of getting better? feeling about me, even in the astonishment aroused in me by my getting well, which I hadn\u2019t dared hope for.\u201d","What else can one do, when we think of all the things we do not know the reason for, than go look at a field of wheat? The history of those plants is like our own; for aren\'t we, who live on bread, to a considerable extent like wheat, at least aren\'t we forced to submit to growing like a plant without the power to move, by which I mean in what way our imagination impels us, and to being reaped when we are ripe, like the same wheat?","If I were living near you, I should try to make you understand that it might perhaps be more practical for you to paint with me than to write, and that you might be able to express your feelings more easily that way. In any case I can do something personally about your painting, but I am not in the writing profession.","Where it is conventional, bitterness is almost unavoidable, just because one does not feel free, and even though one doesn\u2019t express one\u2019s real feelings, they are sufficiently apparent to leave a continuing disagreeable impression on both sides and to make it hopeless for one to profit from the other\u2019s society. Where there is conventional, there is mistrust, and mistrust gives rise to all kinds of intrigues. And with a little more mutual sincerity, our lives would be so much easier.","On commence par tuer, on finit par guerir, [One begins by killing, one ends by healing] is a doctor\u2019s saying. One starts with a hopeless struggle to follow nature, and everything goes wrong; one ends by calmly creating from one\u2019s palette, and nature agrees with it, and follows.\u201d","The rest certainly must seem damn bad. And the days when I bring home a study I say to myself - If it was like this every day, we might be able to get on; but the days when you come back empty-handed, and eat and sleep and spend money all the same, you don\u2019t think much of yourself, and you feel like a fool and a shirker and a good-for-nothing.\u201d","Your life would be empty indeed if you didn\'t regret anything.","What a mistake Parisians make in not having a palate for crude things, for Monticellis, for common earthenware. But there, one most not lose heart because Utopia is not coming true. It is only that what I learned in Paris is leaving me, and I am returning to the ideas I had in the country before I knew the impressionists. And I should not be surprised if the impressionists soon find fault with my way of working, for it has been fertilized by Delacroix\u2019s ideas rather than by theirs. Because instead of trying to reproduce exactly what I have before my eyes, I use colour more arbitrarily, in order to express myself forcibly. Well, let that be, as far as theory goes, but I\u2019m going to give you an example of what I mean.","It is sometimes hard for me to believe that a period of, for instance, only fifty years is sufficient to bring about such a total change that everything is the other way around. But just by reflecting on history one learns to see those relatively quick and continual changes; from it I conclude that every man weighs the scale somewhat, no matter how little, and that how one thinks and acts does make a difference. The battle is but short, and sincerity is worth while. If many are sincere and firm, the whole period becomes good - at least, energetic.","It does not surprise me very much that I had my share of botheration with former friends who did not want to see me any longer. But fortunately this was not the case with my best friend - I mean my brother - for he and I are far more friends than brothers, and he is a man who can understand such things - more than that, who has helped and is still helping many unfortunates. I have lost some friends through it, all the same, but on the other hand I have more light and shade in my own house, although at times, when my worries become too great, I feel as if I were on a ship during a hurricane. But you see, although I well know that the sea has its dangers, and that one can drown in it, still I love the sea; and, notwithstanding all the perils that the future may hold, I have a certain serenity.","Is that all, or is there more besides? In a painter\u2019s life death is not perhaps the hardest thing there is. For my own part, I declare I know nothing whatever about it. But to look at the stars always makes me dream, as simply as I dream over the black dots of a map representing towns and villages. Why, I ask myself, should the shining dots of the sky not be as accessible as the black dots on the map of France? If we take the train to get to Tarascon or Rouen, we take death to reach a star. One thing undoubtedly true in this reasoning is this: that while we are alive we cannot get to a star, any more than when we are dead we can take the train.","You must not go there in too anemic or enervated a condition, if you set a value on coming out of it stronger. I do not consider it a great misfortune for you to be obliged to be a soldier, but rather as a very serious trial from which you will emerge - if you emerge at all - a very great artist.","I painted prettily like Bouguereau, people would not be ashamed to let themselves be painted, but I think that I have lost models because they thought that they were \u201cbadly done, because \u201cit was only pictures full of painting\u201d that I did. The poor little souls are afraid of being compromised and that people will laugh at their portraits. But it is almost enough to make you lose heart when you think that you could do something if people had more good will. I cannot resign myself to saying - \u201csour grapes\u201d","And do come as soon as you possibly can! P.S. to Gauguin. If you are not ill, do please come at once. If you are too ill, a wire and a letter, please. P.S. to Theo. Perhaps you will think the P.S. to Gauguin too curt, but let him say whether or not he is ill, and anyhow he will recover better here. Have you received my canvases???","Recently I had a conversation on the same subject with the man whom I board with, who is a farmer himself. It was by chance, because he asked me how things were in London, he had heard so much about it. I told him that in my opinion a simple farmer who works, and works intelligently, is the civilized man, that it has always been so and always will be, that in the country one finds an example of it here and there, and in the city one finds a few men who are almost as noble, though in quite a different way, among the very, very rare excellent people. But that in my opinion it goes no further, and that in general there is more chance of finding a reasonable human being in the country than in the city. And that in my opinion the nearer one gets to the large cities, the further one gets into the darkness of degeneration and stupidity and wickedness. He said, in fact, that he was of the same opinion.","I am not writing to Gauguin direct, but will send the letter to you, because in any case we had better sit tight. If we say nothing more, if the reply shows that we have made such and such a proposal but that there must be some initiative on his side too, then we can see if he is keen on it. If he is not keen on it, if it\u2019s all the same to him, if he has something else in mind, let him remain independent and me too.","I shall be glad to do all I can to make a success of what we began in the caf\xe9, but I think that the primary condition on which success depends is to set aside all petty jealousies, for only union is strength. Surely the common interest is worth the sacrifice of that selfishness of every man for himself.","But then I know that I am not - not their equal - but didn\u2019t the Flauberts and Balzacs make the Zolas and Maupassants? So here\u2019s to - not us, but to the generation to come.","But I cannot help thinking that the best way of knowing God is to love many things. Love this friend, this person, this thing, whatever you like, and you will be on the right road to understanding Him better, that is what I keep telling myself. But you must love with a sublime, genuine, profound sympathy, with devotion, with intelligence, and you must try all the time to understand Him more, better and yet more. That will lead to God, that will lead to an unshakeable faith.","To my letter of the day before yesterday I want to add that yesterday I had a letter from Rappard, and that our quarrel is completely made up, that he has sent me a sketch of a large picture of a brickyard which he is painting.","You are a good enough judge of painting to see and understand what I may have of originality, and also to see the uselessness of presenting what I am doing to the modern public, because the others surpass me in clearness of touch. That is more the fault of wind and circumstances, compared to what I could do without the mistral and without the fatal conditions of vanished youth and comparative poverty. For my part I am in no way set on changing my condition, and I count myself only too happy to be able to go on as I do.","But he seems to have misunderstood my intention, as he got the impression that I planned to live on the bounty of my uncles; this being his opinion, he wrote me a very discouraging letter, and said I had no right to do such a thing. I certainly do not pretend to have the right, but I want to prevent this affair from ever becoming the subject of gossip in the studios; therefore I think that it is necessary for good relations between myself and the family to be re-established, at any rate provisionally and outwardly, in expectation of their changing their minds about me.","Try to grasp the essence of what the great artists, the serious masters, say in their masterpieces, and you will again find God in them. One man has written or said it in a book, another in a painting. Just read the Bible and the Gospel, that will start you thinking, thinking about many things, thinking about everything, well then, think about many things, think about everything, that will lift your thoughts above the humdrum despite yourself. We know how to read, so let us read!","I insist on this, the plan remains just as real and solid whether Gauguin comes or not, seeing that our object doesn\u2019t change - to deliver me and one of the comrades from this cancer that is gnawing at our work, this being forced to live in these ruinous inns without any profit to ourselves. It is pure madness.","A caged bird in spring knows perfectly well that there is some way in which he should be able to serve. He is well aware that there is something to be done, but he is unable to do it. What is it? He cannot quite remember, but then he gets a vague inkling and he says to himself, \u201cThe others are building their nests and hatching their young and bringing them up, and then he bangs his head against the bars of the cage. But the cage does not give way and the bird is maddened by pain. \u201cWhat a idler,\u201d says another bird passing by - what an idler. Yet the prisoner lives and does not die. There are no outward signs of what is going on inside him; he is doing well, he is quite cheerful in the sunshine. But then the season of the great migration arrives, an attack of melancholy. He has everything he needs, say the children who tend him in his cage - but he looks out, at the heavy thundery sky, and in his heart of hearts he rebels against his fate. I am caged, I am caged and you say I need nothing, you idiots! I have everything I need, indeed! Oh! please give me the freedom to be a bird like other birds!\u201d","ache belo tudo o que puder, a maioria das pessoas n\xe3o acha belo o suficiente.","I hope when you go back to Holland you will take along some study of mine to decorate your room.","Ce que l\u2019homme tue Dieu le ressuscite [What man kills God resuscitates].","The Yellow House has never left the artist\u2019s estate. Since 1962, it has been held by the Vincent van Gogh Foundation, established by the artist\u2019s nephew, and is permanently housed in the Van Gogh Museum, Amsterdam.","Vincent\u2019s House in Arles (The Yellow House) This painting depicts the right wing of 2 Place Lamartine, Arles, France \u2014 the house van Gogh rented in May 1888. The window on the first floor near the corner with both shutters open is the artist\u2019s guest room, where Gauguin lived for nine weeks later in the same year. Behind the next window, with one shutter closed, is van Gogh\u2019s bedroom. Van Gogh depicts the restaurant, where he used to have his meals, in the building painted pink close to the left edge of the painting. To the right side of the Yellow House, the Avenue Montmajour runs down to the two railway bridges. The first line, with a train just passing, served the local connection to Lunel, which is on the opposite bank of the river Rh\xf4ne. Sadly, the building was severely damaged in a bombing raid by the Allies on June 25, 1944 and was later demolished.","There is nothing more beautiful than nature in the early morning.","Spero di avere un po\u2019 di fortuna con quel quadro dei mangiatori di patate.","Sim, para mim, o drama da tempestade na natureza, o drama da dor na vida, s\xe3o certamente os mais perfeitos.

I believe it is not necessary to say anything unpleasant to Gauguin if he does change his mind, and take it absolutely in good part.","And look here, the doctors, who you say cannot do very much now and then, which you are at liberty to say as often as you think proper - very well - but do you know what they can do nevertheless? - they can press your hand more cordially and more gently than many other people can, and their presence may at times be very sympathetic and reassuring.","All right, but think of the winter, for here you can work all year round. The reason why I love this country is that I have less to fear from the cold, which, because it stops my blood circulating properly, makes it impossible for me to think or even do anything at all.","Asl\u0131nda zorluklar\u0131n \xfcst\xfcnde fazla d\xfc\u015f\xfcnm\xfcyorum, \xe7\xfcnk\xfc bunlar \xfcst\xfcnde gere\u011finden fazla durdun mu sersemliyorsun ya da iyice bozuluyorsun.","quanto mais eu reflito, mais eu sinto que n\xe3o h\xe1 nada de mais realmente art\xedstico que amar as pessoas.","Still, a great deal of light falls on everything","It is true, however, that first impressions often change, for we know only too well that all is not gold that glitters and that though there may be a bright dawn, there is also a dark midnight and a burning, oppressive heat at noon.","An artist needn\'t be a clergyman or a churchwanderer, but he certainly must have a warm heart for his fellow men.","Tudo aqui \xe9 perfeitamente belo, como eu gosto.

And if, defrauded of the power to create physically, a man tries to create thoughts in place of children, he is still very much part of humanity.","My dear sister, it is my belief that it is actually one\u2019s duty to paint the rich and magnificent aspects of nature.

I think that Gauguin doesn\u2019t care a damn about it, because it isn\u2019t going to be done at once, and I for my part, seeing that Gauguin has managed to muddle along by himself for six months, am ceasing to believe in the urgent necessity of helping him.","If one really loves nature, one can find beauty everywhere.","One must never trust the occasion when one is without difficulties.","So I have a horror of success.","It is clear to me that there is a je ne sais quoi - I already see it in your words, pictures of some little corners in Paris, etc., even now I should see it in your first sketches and studies. When I think of Father, it seems to me that the good in him is due to his intercourse with nature, and in my opinion his error is that he attaches more value to other things than they are really worth.","Mas o que me toca, assim como certos romancistas de nossa \xe9poca, \xe9 que as vozes dessas pessoas, que no caso de Shakespeare nos chegam de uma dist\xe2ncia de v\xe1rios s\xe9culos, n\xe3o nos pare\xe7am desconhecidas. \xc9 t\xe3o vivo que acreditamos conhec\xea-las e v\xea-las.","one must never let the fire in one\u2019s soul die, for the time will inevitably come when it will be needed.","All I ask in painting is a way of escaping from life.","The more I am spent, ill, a broken pitcher, so much more am I an artist.","Love is the best and the noblest thing in the human heart, especially when it is tested by life as gold is tested by fire.","Enfim, \xe9 preciso que eu tente levar as coisas um pouco mais passivamente e ter paci\xeancia","Mi occorre anche una notte stellata con dei cipressi,","Tanr\u0131 dertleri, ac\u0131lar\u0131 g\xf6r\xfcyor ve her \u015feye kar\u015f\u0131n O yard\u0131m edebilir. \u0130\xe7imdeki Tanr\u0131 inanc\u0131 \xe7ok sa\u011flam -kafamda uydurdu\u011fum bir \u015fey de\u011fil, temelsiz, ge\xe7ici bir inan\xe7 de\u011fil- do\u011fru olan, ger\xe7ek olan \u015fu ki, ya\u015fayan bir Tanr\u0131 var; O ana babam\u0131zdan yana, g\xf6zleri bizim de \xfcst\xfcm\xfczde ve eminim ki ya\u015fam\u0131m\u0131z\u0131 O planl\u0131yor ve biz asl\u0131nda tam anlam\u0131yla kendi kendimize ait de\u011filiz -ve bu Tanr\u0131, \u0130ncilimiz\'de okudu\u011fumuz, s\xf6zleri ve yapt\u0131klar\u0131 y\xfcreklerimizin en derinlerinde ya\u015fayan \u0130sa Peygamber\'den ba\u015fkas\u0131 de\u011fil.","There was once a man who went to church and asked, \'Can it be that my ardour has deceived me, that I have taken a wrong turning and managed things badly?

Act now as if you were certain and you will not be disappointed.\' Then the man went on his way, not unbelieving but believing, and returned to his work no longer doubting or wavering.","The more I think it over, the more I feel that is is nothing more truly artistic than to love people.","I do not say - far, very far be it from me to say - that I myself have the rayon blanc, but I am not ashamed to say that it exists, this White Light - and that I seek it, and only this do I consider simplicity.","que voc\xea encontre em seu amor pelas pessoas motivo n\xe3o s\xf3 para trabalhar mas com que se consolar e reerguer-se, quando necess\xe1rio","N\xe3o poderia acreditar que \xe9 natural haver tanta frieza e desacordo.","Podemos viver, muito ou pouco, mas sempre haver\xe1 momentos em que perderemos a cabe\xe7a.","I always believe that I have a certain toughness in common with the peasants, who also do not eat so particularly well, and yet live and work on.","E o que devemos evitar a seguir, na minha opini\xe3o, \xe9 o desejo de ser na sociedade algo al\xe9m de um pintor, quando se \xe9 um pintor.","If I can manage to paint the coloring of my own head, which is not to be done without some difficulty, I shall likewise be able to paint the heads of other good souls","E, com um pouco mais de sinceridade, tornar\xedamos a vida mais f\xe1cil para todos.","The gables of the houses, like a fading road below a blue sky studded with stars, are dark blue or violet with a green tree. Here you have a night painting without black, with nothing but beautiful blue and violet and green and in this surrounding the illuminated area colours itself sulfur pale yellow and citron green. It amuses me enormously to paint the night right on the spot. Normally, one draws and paints the painting during the daytime after the sketch. But I like to paint the thing immediately. It is true that in the darkness I can take a blue for a green, a blue lilac for a pink lilac, since it is hard to distinguish the quality of the tone. But it is the only way to get away from our conventional night with poor pale whitish light, while even a simple candle already provides us with the richest of yellows and oranges. Caf\xe9 Terrace at Night is the first painting in which van Gogh used starry backgrounds. Later, he went on to use this technique more prominently in The Starry Night.\u201d","O mal \xe9 que estou bastante propenso a me deixar impressionar, a sentir eu pr\xf3prio as cren\xe7as de outrem e a nem sempre questionar o fundo de verdade que possa existir no absurdo.","Quanto a saber se \xe9 vend\xe1vel ou invend\xe1vel, este \xe9 um estribilho ma\xe7ante, e n\xe3o estou nem um pouco disposto a gastar minha energia nisto.","And yet, my dear sister, to what an extent doctors, engineers, in short lots of people, have more practical, stabler ideas than artists!

Too many beautiful things have been done too unusually well for me to prefer one to the other systematically. And the changes which the moderns have made in art are not always for the better; not everything means progress - neither in the works nor in the artists themselves - and often it seems to me that many lose sight of the origin and the goal, or in other words, they do not stick to the point.","Theo, do not become materialistic like Tersteeg.

The earlier series was executed in Paris in 1887, depicting the flowers lying on the ground, while the second series was undertaken a year later in Arles, portraying bouquets of sunflowers in a vase. Van Gogh had hoped to welcome and impress his artist friend Gauguin with a Sunflowers work, which he hung in the guestroom of his Yellow House where Gauguin stayed. In a letter to his brother Theo, van Gogh wrote, \u201cIt is a kind of painting that rather changes in character, and takes on a richness the longer you look at it. Besides, you know, Gauguin likes them extraordinarily. He said to me among other things, \u2018That...it\u2019s...the flower.\u2019 You know that the peony is Jeannin\u2019s, the hollyhock belongs to Quost, but the sunflower is somewhat my own.","The concern about Vincent oppresses us heavily. I foresee that again a bomb is going to burst. It is apparent that the beginning of his studies are disappointing to him, and his heart seems to be torn by conflicting forces. He has now tied up connections with English and French clergymen of ultra-orthodox views - and as a result the number of faults in his work has increased again. I am afraid he has no idea what studying means, and now I fear the remedy he will choose will be again a proposal for a change, for instance to become a catechist!

Ma questo filo di erba li porta poi a disegnare tutte le piante e quindi le stagioni, le grandi linee del paesaggio, gli animali e infine la figura umana. Cos\xec trascorre la sua vita l\'artista giapponese e la vita gli sembra troppo breve per riuscire a fare tutto. Quel che ci insegnano questi giapponesi tanto semplici e che vivono nella natura come se essi fossero dei fiori, ha molto di una vera religione.

But it might well be that she herself has a presentiment that at the same time it will be a leave-taking.","The calamity leaves us our old courage and our old earnest energy. Let the world say venomously what it cannot refrain from saying; it will leave you and me cold. On the contrary, we are counting on the possibility of a hard life which will have a purpose other than earning as much money as possible. Our purpose is in the first place self-reform by means of a handicraft and of intercourse with nature, believing as we do that this is our first duty in order to be honest with others and to be consistent - our aim is walking with God - the opposite of living in the midst of the doings of the big cities.","You are kind to painters, and I tell you, the more I think it over, the more I feel that there is nothing more truly artistic than to love people.

Gli artisti egiziani con la loro grande fede, lavorando di sentimento e d\'istinto, sono riusciti ad esprimere tutte queste cose inafferrabili (la bont\xe0, la pazienza infinita, la saggezza, la serenit\xe0) soltanto con qualche curva sapiente governata da proporzioni meravigliose.","Cerchiamo di non dimenticare, carissimo, che le piccole emozioni sono le grandi guide della nostra vita e che ad esse obbediamo senza saperlo.","It is sometimes so bitterly cold in the winter that one says, `The cold is too awful for me to care whether summer is coming or not; the harm outdoes the good.\u2019 But with or without our approval, the severe weather does come to an end eventually and one fine morning the wind changes and there is the thaw.

Oh! what sorrow, what sadness and suffering there is in the world, in public as well as in private life.","Estou bem estes dias, a n\xe3o ser um certo fundo de vaga tristeza dif\xedcil de definir","Se algo em seu \xedntimo lhe disser \u201cvoc\xea n\xe3o \xe9 pintor, \xe9 ent\xe3o que voc\xea deve pintar, meu velho, e tamb\xe9m esta voz se calar\xe1, mas somente desta maneira;\u201d","It must be good to die in the knowledge that one has done some truthful work and to know that, as a result, one will live on in the memory of at least a few, and leave a good example for those who come after. A work that is good may not last for ever, but the thought expressed by it will. And the work itself will surely survive for a very long time. And those who come later can do no better than follow in the footsteps of such predecessors and copy their example.\\"\\"The Letters of Vincent van Gogh\\" (Amsterdam, 3 March 1878)","So I think there must be more animation, and we must throw all doubts overboard, and also a certain lack of confidence. Do you want a motive for keeping one\u2019s serenity even when one is isolated and misunderstood, and has lost all chance for material happiness? This one thing remains - faith; one feels instinctively that an enormous number of things are changing and that everything will change. We are living in the last quarter of a century that will end again in a tremendous revolution.","Mesmo esta vida art\xedstica, que sabemos n\xe3o ser a verdadeira, parece-me t\xe3o v\xedvida e seria uma ingratid\xe3o n\xe3o contentar-se com ela.","\u10dc\u10dd\u10e0\u10db\u10d0\u10da\u10e3\u10e0\u10dd\u10d1\u10d0 \u10d0\u10e1\u10e4\u10d0\u10da\u10e2\u10d8\u10d7 \u10d3\u10d0\u10d2\u10d4\u10d1\u10e3\u10da\u10d8 \u10d2\u10d6\u10d0\u10d0, \u10d9\u10dd\u10db\u10e4\u10dd\u10e0\u10e2\u10e3\u10da\u10d8\u10d0 \u10e1\u10d0\u10e1\u10d8\u10d0\u10e0\u10e3\u10da\u10dd\u10d3, \u10db\u10d0\u10d2\u10e0\u10d0\u10db \u10e7\u10d5\u10d0\u10d5\u10d8\u10da\u10d4\u10d1\u10d8 \u10d0\u10e0 \u10d8\u10d6\u10e0\u10d3\u10d4\u10d1\u10d0","Contudo, se queremos viver e trabalhar, \xe9 preciso ser muito prudentes e cuidar-nos. \xc1gua fria, ar, alimenta\xe7\xe3o simples e boa, estar bem agasalhados, dormir bem, e n\xe3o ter aborrecimentos","If there is anything I regret then it is that period when I allowed mystical and theological profundities to mislead me into withdrawing too much into myself.\u2026..When you wake up in the morning and find you are not alone but can see a fellow creature there in the half-light, it makes the world look so much more welcoming.

It depicts Joseph, the father of the family, who was born on 4 April 1841 in Lambesc. Van Gogh and the postman became good friends and drinking companions. Van Gogh compared Roulin to Socrates on many occasions. In appearance, Roulin reminded the painter of the Russian novelist Fyodor Dostoyevsky, who had the same broad forehead, nose and shape of beard."]')}}]);
